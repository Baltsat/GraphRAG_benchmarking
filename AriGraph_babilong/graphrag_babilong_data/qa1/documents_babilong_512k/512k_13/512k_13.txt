"I can't trust you," ses Bill, dragging 'im over to the washstand and
taking up the other towel; "turn round."Peter was a much easier job than Ginger Dick, and arter Bill 'ad done 'im
'e put 'im in alongside o' Ginger and covered 'em up, arter first tying
both the gags round with some string to prevent 'em slipping."Mind, I've only borrowed it," he ses, standing by the side o' the bed;
"but I must say, mates, I'm disappointed in both of you.If either of
you 'ad 'ad the misfortune wot I've 'ad, I'd have sold the clothes off my
back to 'elp you.And I wouldn't 'ave waited to be asked neither."He stood there for a minute very sorrowful, and then 'e patted both their
'eads and went downstairs.Ginger and Peter lay listening for a bit, and
then they turned their pore bound-up faces to each other and tried to
talk with their eyes.Then Ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off, but 'e
might as well 'ave tried to wriggle out of 'is skin.The worst of it was
they couldn't make known their intentions to each other, and when Peter
Russet leaned over 'im and tried to work 'is gag off by rubbing it up
agin 'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper.He banged
Peter with his 'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till
they'd both got splitting 'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair
and lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.And all this time Sam was sitting in the Red Lion, waiting for them.He
sat there quite patient till twelve o'clock and then walked slowly 'ome,
wondering wot 'ad happened and whether Bill had gone.Ginger was the fust to 'ear 'is foot on the stairs, and as he came into
the room, in the darkness, him an' Peter Russet started shaking their bed
in a way that scared old Sam nearly to death.He thought it was Bill
carrying on agin, and 'e was out o' that door and 'arf-way downstairs
afore he stopped to take breath.He stood there trembling for about ten
minutes, and then, as nothing 'appened, he walked slowly upstairs agin on
tiptoe, and as soon as they heard the door creak Peter and Ginger made
that bed do everything but speak.ses old Sam, in a shaky voice, and standing ready
to dash downstairs agin.There was no answer except for the bed, and Sam didn't know whether Bill
was dying or whether 'e 'ad got delirium trimmings.All 'e did know was
that 'e wasn't going to sleep in that room.He shut the door gently and
went downstairs agin, feeling in 'is pocket for a match, and, not finding
one, 'e picked out the softest stair 'e could find and, leaning his 'ead
agin the banisters, went to sleep.[Illustration: "Picked out the softest stair 'e could find."]It was about six o'clock when 'e woke up, and broad daylight.He was
stiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light 'e stepped
softly upstairs and opened the door.Peter and Ginger was waiting for
'im, and as he peeped in 'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their
'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with
bandages.He was that startled 'e nearly screamed, and then 'e stepped
into the room and stared at 'em as if he couldn't believe 'is eyes."Wot d'ye mean by making sights of
yourselves like that?'Ave you took leave of your senses?"Ginger and Peter shook their 'eads and rolled their eyes, and then Sam
see wot was the matter with 'em.Fust thing 'e did was to pull out 'is
knife and cut Ginger's gag off, and the fust thing Ginger did was to call
'im every name 'e could lay his tongue to."You wait a moment," he screams, 'arf crying with rage."You wait till I
get my 'ands loose and I'll pull you to pieces.The idea o' leaving us
like this all night, you old crocodile.He cut off Peter Russet's gag, and Peter Russet
called 'im 'arf a score o' names without taking breath."And when Ginger's finished I'll 'ave a go at you," he ses."Oh, you wait till I get my 'ands on
you."Sam didn't answer 'em; he shut up 'is knife with a click and then 'e sat
at the foot o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em.It wasn't the
fust time they'd been rude to 'im, but as a rule he'd 'ad to put up with
it.He sat and listened while Ginger swore 'imself faint."That'll do," he ses, at last; "another word and I shall put the
bedclothes over your 'ead.Afore I do anything more I want to know wot
it's all about."Peter told 'im, arter fust calling 'im some more names, because Ginger
was past it, and when 'e'd finished old Sam said 'ow surprised he was
at them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave
prevented it.He sat there talking as though 'e enjoyed the sound of 'is
own voice, and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot
sorrow it caused their friends.Twice he 'ad to throw the bedclothes
over their 'eads because o' the noise they was making.[Illustration: "Old Sam said 'ow surprised he was at them for letting
Bill do it."]"_Are you going--to undo--us?_"  ses Ginger, at last."No, Ginger," ses old Sam; "in justice to myself I couldn't do it.Arter
wot you've said--and arter wot I've said--my life wouldn't be safe.Besides which, you'd want to go shares in my money."He took up 'is chest and marched downstairs with it, and about 'arf an
hour arterward the landlady's 'usband came up and set 'em free.As soon
as they'd got the use of their legs back they started out to look for
Sam, but they didn't find 'im for nearly a year, and as for Bill, they
never set eyes on 'im again.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bill's Lapse, by W.W.The idea that we have aught
to fear from Romanism, is simply ridiculous!"In reply to this, allow
me to quote the language of the Rev.Manuel J. Gonsalves, leader of the
Madeira Exiles."The time will come when the American people will arise as one man, and
not only abolish the confessional, but will follow the example of many
of the European nations, who had no peace, or rest, till they banished
the Jesuits.These are the men, who bask in the sunbeams of popery, to
whom the pope has entrusted the vast interests of the king of Rome, in
this great Republic.Nine tenths of the Romish priests, now working hard
for their Master the pope, in this country, are full blooded Jesuits.The man of sin who is the head of the mystery of iniquity--through
the advice of the popish bishops now in this country, has selected
the Jesuitical order of priests, to carry on his great and gigantic
operations in the United States of America.Those Jesuits who
distinguish themselves the most in the destruction of Protestant Bible
religion, and who gain the largest number of protestant scholars for
popish schools and seminaries; who win most American converts to their
sect are offered great rewards in the shape of high offices in the
church.John Hughes, the Jesuit Bishop of the New York Romanists, was
rewarded by Pope Pius 9th, with an Archbishop's mitre, for his great,
zeal and success, in removing God's Holy Bible from thirty-eight public
schools in New York, and for procuring a papal school committee, to
examine every book in the hands of American children in the public
schools, that every passage of truth, in those books of history
unpalatable to the pope might be blotted out."Has America then nothing
to do with Romanism?But another gentleman exclaims, "What if Romanism be on the increase in
the United States!Is not their religion as dear to them, as ours is
to us?"M. J. Gonsalves would reply as follows."The
American people have been deceived, in believing THAT POPERY WAS A
RELIGION, not a very good one to be sure, but some kind of one.We might as well call the Archbishop of the
fallen angels, and his crew, a religious body of intelligent beings,
because they believe in an Almighty God, and tremble, as to call the man
of sin and his Jesuits, a body of religious saints.The tree is known
by its fruit, such as 'love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness,
goodness, meekness, faith, temperance, brotherly kindness;' and where
the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, Christian liberty, giving
to God and man their due unasked.Now we ask, what kind of fruit does
the tree of Popery bear, in any country, that it should claim homage,
and respect, as a good religion?"Such is the language of one who knew so well what popery was, that he
fled from it as from a hell upon earth.In his further remarks upon the horrors of convent life in the United
States, he fully confirms the statements in the foregoing narrative.He
says, "It is time that American gentlemen, who are so much occupied
in business, should think of the dangers of the confessional, and the
miseries endured by innocent, duped, American, imprisoned females in
this free country; and remember that these American ladies who have been
duped and enticed by Jesuitical intrigue and craft, into their female
convents, have no means of deliverance; they cannot write a letter to a
friend without the consent and inspection of the Mother Abbess, who
is always and invariably a female tyrant, a creature in the pay of the
Bishop, and dependent upon the Bishop for her despotic office of power.The poor, unfortunate, imprisoned American female has no means of
redress in her power.She cannot communicate her story of wrong and
suffering to any living being beyond the walls of her prison.She may
have a father, a mother, a dear brother, or a sister, who, if they knew
one-sixteenth part of her wrongs and sufferings, would fly at once to
see her and sympathize with her in her anguish.But the Jesuit confessor
attached to the prison is ever on the alert.Those ladies who appear the
most unhappy, and unreconciled to their prison, are compelled to attend
the confessional every day; and thus the artful Jesuit, by a thousand
cross questions, is made to understand perfectly the state of their
minds.The Lady Porter, or door-keeper and jailor, is always a creature
of the priest's, and a great favorite with the Mother Abbess.Should any
friends call to see an unhappy nun who is utterly unreconciled to her
fate, the Lady Porter is instructed to inform those relatives that the
dear nun they want to see so much, is so perfectly happy, and given up
to heavenly meditations, that she cannot be persuaded to see an earthly
relative.At the same time the Mother Abbess dismisses the relatives
with a very sorrowful countenance, and regrets very much, in appearance,
their disappointment.But the unhappy nun is never informed that her
friends or relatives have called to inquire after her welfare.How
amazing, that government should allow such prisons in the name of
religion!"CONVENT OF THE CAPUCHINS IN SANTIAGO

In a late number of "The American and Foreign Christian Union," we find
the following account of conventual life from a report of a Missionary
in Chile, South America."Now, my brother, let me give you an account related to me by a most
worthy English family, most of the members of which have grown up in the
country, confirmed also by common report, of the Convent of Capuchins,
in Santiago."The number of inmates is limited to thirty-two young ladies.The
admittance fee is $2000.When the nun enters she is dressed like a
bride, in the most costly material that wealth can command.There,
beside the altar of consecration, she devotes herself in the most
solemn, manner to a life of celibacy and mortification of the flesh
and spirit, with the deluded hope that her works will merit a brighter
mansion in the realms above."The forms of consecration being completed, she begins to cast off
her rich veil, costly vestments, all her splendid diamonds and
brilliants--which, in many instances, have cost, perhaps, from ten to
fifteen, or even twenty thousand dollars.Then her beautiful locks are
submitted to the tonsure; and to signify her deadness forever to the
world, she is clothed in a dress of coarse grey cloth, called serge, in
which she is to pass the miserable remnant of her days.The dark sombre
walls of her prison she can sever pass, and its iron-bound doors are
shut forever upon their new, youthful, and sensitive occupant.Rarely,
if ever, is she permitted to speak, and NEVER, NEVER, to see her friends
or The loved ones of home--to enjoy the embraces of a fond mother, or
devoted father, or the smiles of fraternal or sisterly affection.If
ever allowed to speak at all, it is through iron bars where she cannot
be seen, and in the presence of the abbess, to see that no complaint
escapes her lips.However much her bosom may swell with anxiety at the
sound of voices which were once music to her soul, and she may long to
pour out her cries and tears to those who once soothed every sorrow of
her heart; yet not a murmur must be uttered.The soul must suffer
its own sorrows solitary and alone, with none to sympathize, or grant
relief, and none to listen to its moans but the cold gloomy walls of her
tomb.No, no, not even the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that great alleviator
of all the sorrows of the heart, is allowed an entrance there.Besides being condemned to a meagre, insufficient
and unwholesome diet which they themselves must cook, the nuns are
not allowed to speak much with each other, except to say, 'Que morir
tenemos, 'we are to die,' or 'we must die,' and to reply, 'Ya los
sabemos,' 'we know it,' or 'already we know it'

"They pass most of their time in small lonely cells, where they sleep in
a narrow place dug out in the ground, in the shape of a coffin, without
bed of any kind, except a piece of coarse serge spread down; and their
daily dress is their only covering.'Tired
nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep, no more with his downy pinions
lights on his unsullied with a tear:' FOR EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY-FOUR
they are aroused by the bell to perform their 'Ave Maria's,' count their
rosaries, and such other blind devotions as may be imposed.Thus they
drag out a miserable existence, and when death calls the spirit to its
last account, the other nuns dig the grave with their own hands, within
the walls of the convent, and so perform the obsequies of their departed
sister."Thus, I have briefly given you not fiction!but a faithful narrative
of facts in regard to conventual life, and an establishment marked by
almost every form of sin, and yet making pretence of 'perfecting the
saints,' by the free and gentle influences of the gospel of Christ.What is done with the rich vestments and jewels?Where do the priests get all their brilliants to perform high mass
and adorn their processions?Where does all the hair of the saints come from, which is sold in
lockets for high prices as sure preventives of evil?Whose grave has been plundered to obtain RELICS to sell to the
ignorant.Where does the Romish Church obtain her SURPLUS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO
SELL TO THE needy, and not give it like our blessed Lord, 'without money
and without price?'Who is responsible for the FANATICISM that induces a young female
to incarcerate herself?Where is the authority in reason, in revelation, for such a life?"A young lady lately cast herself from the tower, and was dashed in
pieces, being led to do it, doubtless, in desperation.The convents of
this city, of the same order, require the same entrance fee, $2000.Of
course, none but the comparatively rich can avail themselves of this
perfection of godliness."Who will say that this mode of life has not been invented in order to
cut short life as rapidly as possible, that the $2000, with all the rich
diamonds upon initiation, may be repeated as frequently as possible?how true it is, that Romanism is the same merciless, cruel,
diabolical organisation, wherever it can fully develop itself, in
all lands.How truly is it denominated by the pen of inspiration the
'MYSTERY OF INIQUITY,' especially that part of it relating to these
secret institutions, and the whole order of the Jesuits."The editor of the "Christian Union", in his remarks on the above, says,
"Already the fair face of our country is disfigured by the existence
here and there of conventual establishments.At present they do not
show the hideous features which they, at least in some cases, assume in
countries where papal influence and authority are supreme.The genius of
our government and institutions necessarily exerts a restraining power,
which holds them from excesses to which, otherwise, they might run.But
they constitute a part of a system which is strongly at variance with
the interests of humanity, and merely wait the occurrence of favorable
circumstances to visit upon our land all the horrors which they have
inflicted elsewhere."How many conventual establishments there are now in the nation, few
Protestants, it is believed, know.And how many young females, guilty of
no crime against society, and condemned by no law of the land, are shut
up in their walls and doomed to a life which they did not anticipate
when entering them, a life which is more dreadful to them than death,
very few of the millions of our citizens conceive.The majority of our
people have slept over the whole subject, and the indifference thus
manifested has emboldened the priests to posh forward the extension
of the system, and the workmen are now busy in various places in
the construction of additional establishments.But such facts as are
revealed in this article, from the pen of our missionary, in connection
with things that are occurring around us, show that no time should be
lost in examining this whole subject of convents and monasteries, and in
legislating rightly about them."Again, when speaking of papal convents in the United States, the same
talented writer observes, "The time has fully come when Protestants
should lay aside their apathy and too long-cherished indifference in
respect to the movements of Rome in this land.It is time for them to
call to mind the testimony of their fathers, their bitter experiences
from the papal See, and to take effective measures to protect the
inheritance bequeathed to them, that they may hand it down to their
children free from corruption, as pure and as valuable as when they
received it.They should remember that Rome claims never to change, that
what she was in Europe when in the zenith of her power, she will be here
when fairly installed, and has ability to enforce her commands."Her numbers now on our soil, her nearly two thousand priests moving
about everywhere, her colleges and printing-presses, her schools and
convents, and enormous amounts of property held by her bishops, have
served as an occasion to draw out something of her spirit, and to show
that she is ARROGANT AND ABUSIVE TO THE EXTENT OF HER POWER."Scarcely a newspaper issues from her press, but is loaded with abuse of
Protestants and of their religion, and at every available point assaults
are made upon their institutions and laws; and Rome and her institutions
and interests are crowded into notice, and special privileges are loudly
clamored for."All Protestants, therefore, of every name, and of every religious and
political creed, we repeat it, who do not desire to ignore the past, and
to renounce all care or concern for the future, as to their children and
children's children, should lose no time in informing themselves of
the state of things around them in regard to the papacy and its
institutions.They should without delay devote their efforts and
influence to the protection of the country against those Popish
establishments and their usages which have been set up among us without
the authority of law, and under whose crushing weight some of the
nations of Europe have staggered and reeled for centuries, and have now
but little of their former power and glory remaining, and under which
Mexico, just upon our borders, has sunk manifestly beyond the power of
recovery."Let each individual seek to awaken an interest in this matter in
the mind of his neighbor.And if there be papal establishments in
the neighborhood under the names of'schools,''retreats','religions
communities,' or any other designation, which are at variance with, or
are not conformed to, the laws of the commonwealth in which they are
situated, let memorials be prepared and signed by the citizens, and
forwarded immediately to the legislature, praying that they may be
subjected to examination, and required to conform to the laws by which
all Protestant institutions of a public nature are governed."Let us exclude from our national territory all irresponsible
institutions.Let us seek to maintain a government of law, and insist
upon the equality of all classes before it."In closing these extracts, we beg leave to express ourselves in the
words of the Rev.Sunderland, of Washington city, in a sermon
delivered before the American and Foreign Christian Union, at its
anniversary in May, 1856."But new it is asked, 'Why all this tirade against Roman Catholics?'It is not against the unhappy millions that are
ground down under the iron heel of that enormous despotism.They are of
the common humanity, our brethren and kinsmen, according to the flesh.They need the same light instruction and salvation that we need.Like
ourselves they need the one God, the one mediator between God and man,
the man Christ Jesus; and from the heart we love and pity them.We would
grant them all the privileges which we claim to ourselves.We can have
no animosity towards them as men and candidates with ourselves for the
coming judgment.But it is the system under which they are born, and
live, and die, I repeat, which we denounce, and when we shall cease to
oppose it, then let our right hand forget her cunning, and our tongue
cleave to the roof of our mouth.What is it but a dark and terrible
power on earth before which so many horrible memories start up?Why,
sir, look at it!We drag the bones of the grim behemoth out to view, for
we would not have the world forget his ugliness nor the terror he has
inspired.'A tirade against Romanism,' is it?O sir, we remember
the persecutions of Justinian; we remember the days of the Spanish
Inquisition; we remember the reign of 'the Bloody Mary;' we remember
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes; we remember St.Bartholomew;
we remember the murdered Covenanters, Huguenots, and Piedmontese; we
remember the noble martyrs dying for the testimony of the faith along
the ancient Rhine; we remember the later wrath which pursued the
islanders of Madeira, till some of them sought refuge upon these
shores; we remember the Madiai, and we know how the beast ever seeks to
propagate his power, by force where he can, by deception where he must.And when we remember these things, we must protest against the further
vigor and prosperity of this grand Babylon of all.Take it, then, tirade
and all, for so ye must, ye ministers of Rome, sodden with the fumes of
that great deep of abominations!The voice of the Protestant shall never
be hushed; the spirit of Reformation shall never sleep.O, lands of
Farel and of Calvin, of Zwingle and of Luther!O countries where the
trumpet first sounded, marshalling the people to this fearful contest!We have heard the blast rolling still louder down the path of three
hundred years, and in our solid muster-march we come, the children
of the tenth generation.We come a growing phalanx, not with carnal
weapons, but with the armor of the gospel, and wielding the sword of
truth on the right hand and on the left, we say that ANTICHRIST MUST
FALL.Hear it, ye witnesses, and mark the word; by the majesty of the
coming kingdom of Jesus, and by the eternal purpose of Jehovah, THIS
ANTICHRIST MUST FALL."Worlidge says, that in this treatise Austen hath "very
copiously set forth the high applauses, dignities, advantages, and
variety of pleasures and contents, in the planting and enjoyment of

the following:--

"He was a German gentleman by birth, a great promoter of husbandry
during the times of the commonwealth, and much esteemed by all ingenious
men in those days, particularly by Milton, who addressed to him his
Treatise on Education; Sir William Petty also inscribed two letters to
him on the same subject.Cromwell, who was a
great favourer of agriculture, in consequence of this admirable
performance, allowed Hartlib a pension of L100.a year; and Hartlib
afterwards, the better to fulfil the intentions of his benefactor,
procured Dr.Beatie's excellent annotations on the Legacy, with other
valuable pieces from his numerous correspondents.This famous work,
attributed to Hartlib, and called the Legacy, was only drawn up at his
request, and, passing through his correction and revision, was published
by him."His name will ever stand honoured, from Milton having
dedicated his _Tractate on Education_ to him, and from his having, in
this tract, painted with affection, and with warm and high colours, the
character of Mr.JOHN BEALE, author of that celebrated little tract, the
"Herefordshire Orchards, a pattern for the whole of England."_London_
1657, 12mo.Hartlib, and thus
commences it:--"Your industrious endeavours for the benefit of all men,
and particularly for the good of this nation, hath well deserved the
grateful acknowledgement of all good men, and of my self in special; for
that in my rural retirement I have received some profit, and very much
innocent and refreshing delights in the perusal of those treatises,
which are by your diligent hand communicated to the publick."He thus
affectionately concludes it:--"I briefly hint unto you what esteem we do
truly owe unto your labours.I pray the Lord to remember your diligence
in the great day of his appearance in glory.6 of the works of the Honourable Robert Boyle, are many letters
from Dr.26, strongly paints his attachment to
the fruits of Herefordshire, or whatever may tend to the benefit of that
his native county.Boyle says of him, "There is not in life, a man
in this whole island, nor on the continents beyond the seas, that could
be made more universally useful to do good to all."Gough, in
his Topography, records the benefits he conferred on that county.Such a
testimony as the above, from such a man as Mr.Boyle, is, indeed,
honourable.The learned Boerhaave tells us who Mr.Boyle was: "Boyle,
the ornament of his age and country, succeeded to the genius and
enquiries of the great Verulam.Which of all Boyle's writings shall I
recommend?To him we owe the secrets of fire, air, water,
animals, vegetables, fossils, so that from his works may be reduced the
whole system of natural knowledge."Beale resided chiefly at Hereford, (1660) when he was made
Rector of Yeovil, Somersetshire, where he died in 1683, at the age of
eighty.Loudon's Encyclopaedia of
Gardening.Evelyn, in the greatest of his works, (his Sylva,) adds
to it Dr.William Brome, a principal ornament of Christ Church, a native of
Herefordshire, and who afterwards lived in retirement at Ewithington, in
that county, "formed the plan (says the late Mr.Dunster in his edition
of Phillips's Cyder) of writing the Provincial History of his native
county, a work for which he was eminently qualified, not only by his
great and general learning, but as being particularly an excellent
naturalist and antiquary.After having made a considerable progress, he
abandoned his design, and, which is still more to be lamented, destroyed
the valuable materials which he had collected."I merely introduce this
to state, that from Mr.Brome, much information, in all likelihood,
might have been gathered respecting Dr.We have to regret, that
time and mortality, have now obliterated every fading trace of
contemporary recollection of a man, who, in his day, was so highly
esteemed.[32]

ROBERT SHARROCK, Archdeacon of Winchester, and Rector of Bishop's
Waltham, and of Horewood.Wood, in his Athenae, says, "he was accounted
learned in divinity, in the civil and common law, and very knowing in
vegetables, and all appertaining thereunto.He published The History of
the Propagation and Improvement of Vegetables, by the concurrence of art
and nature._Oxford_, 1660, 8vo., and 1672, 8vo.: an account of which
book you may see in the Phil.He also
published Improvements to the Art of Gardening; or an exact Treatise on
Plants._London_, 1694; folio.This must have been a posthumous work, as
he died in 1684.---- ILIFFE, in 1670, published in 12mo.JOHN REA, the author of "Flora, Ceres, and Pomona."It is enriched by a
frontispiece engraved by D. Loggan.He dedicates the above folio, in
1665, to Lord Gerard, of Gerard's Bromley.His lordship, it seems, about
that time, determined to erect that noble mansion, which Plot has given
us a plate of; and Rea, in this folio, enumerates those plants, fruits,
and flowers, which he thinks this then-intended garden ought to be
furnished with; and a small bit, or a piece or parcel, of which once
most sumptuous garden, Plot gives us."Altho' (says Rea) our country
cannot boast the benignity of that beautiful planet which meliorates
their fruit in Italy, France, and Spain; yet, by reflection from good
walks, well gravelled walks, the choice of fit kinds, we may plentifully
partake the pleasure, and yearly enjoy the benefit, of many delicious
fruits: as also the admiration and delight in the infinite varieties of
elegant forms, various colours, and numerous kinds of noble plants, and
beautiful flowers, some whereof have been heretofore handled by a
renowned person of your name; but since his time, nature hath discovered
many new varieties, not known to former ages, as I hope shortly will
appear in your own collections, gloriously adorning your spacious
garden, which I wish may correspond, both in fashion and furniture, with
that noble structure to which it appertaineth.Accept then, my honoured
lord, this humble offering, which may possibly live to do you service,
when I am dust and ashes, and, according to my highest ambition, remain
as a testimony of my sincerest gratitude for the many favours I have
received from your honour, your most accomplished lady, and that noble
family from whence she is descended.I should here add my prayers for
your honour's preservation, did I not reserve them for my morning
sacrifice, daily to be presented to the immortal deities by him that
is, your most humble and most devoted servant, John Rea."He addresses
also a long poem to Lady Gerard, on Flora inviting her to walk in this
garden, in which he celebrates her "bright beauty."Self-loved _Narcissus_, if he look
   On your fair eyes, will leave the brook,
   And undeceived, soon will rue
   He ever any loved but you.If to the _hyacinth_ you turn,
   He smiles, and quite forgets to mourn.The enamoured _heliotrope_ will run
   To your bright stars, and leave the sun.Our _lilies_ here do make no show,
   They whiter on your bosom grow,
   And _violets_ appear but stains,
   Compared with your bluer veins.*       *       *       *       *

   New-blown buds, all scents excelling,
   As you pass by, invite your smelling.*       *       *       *       *

   Mark the glorious _tulips_ rise
   In various dress, to take your eyes,
   And how the fairest and all the rest
   Strive which shall triumph on your breast.*       *       *       *       *

   Thus your rich beauty and rare parts
   Excel all flowers, exceed all arts.Live then, sweet lady, to inherit
   Your father's fortune, and his spirit,
   Your mother's face and virtuous mind.[33]

Throughout this long poem, John Rea's warmth much exceeds that of the
most romantic lovers.One of the latter only observes, that the flowers
courted the tread of his fair one's foot; that the sky grew more
beautiful in her presence, and that the atmosphere borrowed new
splendour from her eyes.Rea's passion seems even warmer than this.In
his address to the reader, he says, "I have continued my affection to
this honest recreation, without companion or encouragement; and now in
my old age, (wearied and weaned from other delights) find myself more
happy in this retired solitude, than in all the bustles and busie
employments of my passed days."He thus concludes his book:--

              ---- this is all I crave:
   Some gentle hand with flowers may strew my grave,
   And with one sprig of bays my herse befriend,
   When as my life, as now my book, doth end.Rea gives us also another very long poem, being that of "Flora to the
Ladies," which he thus concludes:--

   Silent as flow'rs may you in virtues grow,
   Till rip'ning time shall make you fit to blow,
   Then flourish long, and seeding leave behind
   A numerous offspring of your dainty kind;
   And when fate calls, have nothing to repent,
   But die like flow'rs, virtuous and innocent.Then all your fellow flow'rs, both fair and sweet,
   Will come, with tears, to deck your winding-sheet;
   Hang down their pensive heads so dew'd, and crave
   To be transplanted to your perfum'd grave.These love poems seem all to have been written in his old age; and that
passion causes him thus to open his first book:--"Love was the inventor,
and is still the maintainer, of every noble science.It is chiefly that
which hath made my flowers and trees to flourish, though planted in a
barren desert, and hath brought me to the knowledge I now have in plants
and planting; for indeed it is impossible for any man to have any
considerable collection of plants to prosper, unless he love them: for
neither the goodness of the soil, nor the advantage of the situation,
will do it, without the master's affection; it is that which renders
them strong and vigorous; without which they will languish and decay
through neglect, and soon cease to do him service.I have seen many
gardens of the new model, in the hands of unskilful persons, with good
walls, walks and grass-plots; but in the most essential adornments so
deficient, that a green meadow is a more delightful object; there nature
alone, without the aid of art, spreads her verdant carpets,
spontaneously embroidered with many pretty plants and pleasing flowers,
far more inviting than such an immured nothing.And as noble fountains,
grottoes, statues, &c. are excellent ornaments and marks of
magnificence, so all such dead works in gardens, ill done, are little
better than blocks in the way to intercept the sight, but not at all to
satisfy the understanding.A choice collection of living beauties, rare
plants, flowers and fruits, are indeed the wealth, glory, and delight of
a garden."He describes no less than one
hundred and ninety different sorts.He calls them "Flora's choicest
jewels, and the most glorious ornaments of the best gardens.Such is
their rarity and excellence, and so numerous are the varieties, that it
is not possible any one person in the world should be able to express,
or comprehend the half of them, every new spring discovering many new
diversities never before observed, either arising from the seeds of some
choice kinds, the altering of off-sets, or by the busy and secret
working of nature upon several self-colours, in different soils and
situations, together with the help of art."[34] Switzer says, "the
practical and plain method in which he has delivered his precepts, are
admirable."There is a second edition of the Flora, _with additions_.What these are, I know not; unless they are the cuts of parterres, which
were omitted in the first edition.JOHN WORLIDGE published his Systema Agriculturae in folio, 1668; second
edition in 1675, folio: fourth edition in 1687, folio.An octavo edition
1716, with its English title of "A compleat System of Husbandry and
Gardening, or the Gentleman's Companion in the Business and Pleasures of
a Country life."In the preface to this, and indeed throughout all his
works, we may trace his fondness for gardens.The great variety of rural
subjects treated on in this book, may be seen in its Index, or full
Analysis.In his second section "Of the profits and pleasures of
fruit-trees," he strongly enforces the planting of vineyards.His Systema Horticulturae, or the Art of Gardening, was published in
1677, 8vo.; a third edition 1688; a fourth edition 1719.Vinetum Britannicum, or a Treatise on Cyder, and other Wines and Drinks,
extracted from Fruits: to which is added, a Discourse on Bees; 8vo.,
_second impression, much enlarged_, 1678.He therein thus paints the
pleasures of a garden:--"The exercises of planting, grafting, pruning,
and walking in them, very much tendeth to salubrity, as also doth the
wholesome airs found in them, which have been experienced not only to
cure several distempers incident to our nature, but to tend towards the
prolongation of life.For nothing can be more available to health and
long life, than a sedate quiet mind, attended with these rural delights,
a healthful air, and moderate exercise, which may here be found in all
seasons of the year."He also published, The Second Parts of Systema Agriculturae, 8vo.The Second Part of Vinetum Britannicum, 8vo.His attachment to whatever concerns a rural life, shines through most of
his pages.Take the few following for a specimen:--

In his description of the month of _April_, he says, "In this month your
garden appears in its greatest beauty, the blossoms of the fruit-trees
prognosticate the plenty of fruits for all the succeeding summer months,
unless prevented by untimely frosts or blights.The bees now buz in
every corner of your garden to seek for food; the birds sing in every
bush, and the sweet nightingale tunes her warbling notes in your
solitary walks, whilst the other birds are at their rest.The beasts of
the woods look out into the plains, and the fishes of the deep sport
themselves in the shallow waters.The air is wholesome, and the earth
pleasant, beginning now to be cloathed in nature's best array, exceeding
all art's glory.This is the time that whets the wits of several nations
to prove their own country to have been the _Garden of Eden_, or the
terrestrial paradise, however it appears all the year besides.In case
unseasonable weather hinders not, the pleasantness and salubrity of the
air now tempts the sound to the free enjoyment of it, rather than to
enjoy the pleasures of _Bacchus_ in a smoaky corner."In his month of
_May_, he says, "He that delights not in physick, let him now exercise
himself in the _garden_, and take the smell of the earth with the rising
sun, than which to the virtuously inclined, there is nothing more
pleasant; for now is nature herself full of mirth, and the senses stored
with delights, and variety of pleasures."His month of _July_ thus
recommends itself: "Grotts and shady groves are more seasonable to
recreate yourself in than the open air, unless it be late in the
evening, or early in the morning, to such that can afford time to take a
nap after noon."he observes, that "A fair stream or current flowing
through or near your _garden_, adds much to the glory and pleasure of
it: on the banks of it you may plant several aquatick exoticks, and have
your seats or places of repose under their umbrage, and there satiate
yourself with the view of the curling streams, and its nimble
inhabitants.These gliding streams refrigerate the air in a summer
evening, and render their banks so pleasant, that they become resistless
charms to your senses, by the murmuring noise, the undulation of the
water, the verdant banks and shades over them, the sporting fish
confined within your own limits, the beautiful swans; and by the
pleasant notes of singing birds, that delight in groves, on the banks of
such rivulets."[35]

And in his preface to this last work, he says, "My principal design
being not only to excite or animate such as have fair estates, and
pleasant seats in the country, to adorn and beautifie them; but to
encourage the honest and plain countryman in the improvement of his
Ville, by enlarging the bounds and limits of his _Gardens_, as well as
his _Orchards_, for the encrease of such esculent plants as may be
useful and beneficial to himself and his neighbors."FRANCIS DROPE, B. D., who died at Oxford, and whose father was Vicar of
Cumner, in Berkshire.Wood, in his Athenae, says, "he hath written on a
subject which he much delighted in, and wherein he spent much time, but
which was not published till his death: A short and sure guide to the
practice of raising, and ordering of fruit trees, _Oxford_, 1672, 12mo.,
a large and laudable account of which you may see in the Phil.MOSES COOKE, Gardener to the Earl of Essex, at Cashiobury, afterwards a
partner with Lucre, Field and London, in the Brompton Park Nursery.He
wrote "The Art of making Cyder," published in Mr.The
manner of raising Forest Trees, 4to.in
1717, 1724, and 1770.Evelyn (speaking of Cashiobury) says, "The
gardens are very rare, and cannot be otherwise, having so skilful an
artist to govern them as Cooke."Moses Cooke, in his preface, justly
says, "Planting and Gardening add much to the health and content of man;
and these two jewels no man that well understands himself, would
willingly be without; for it is not only set down for a certain truth by
many wise men, but confirmed by experience.The learned Lord Bacon
commends the following of the plough in fresh ground, to be very
healthful for man; but more, the digging in gardens."His pages, here
and there, record some of "the fine stately trees that we have growing
in the woods at Cashiobury."Cooke unfortunately fancied himself a poet;
but gratitude to his noble master, and loyalty to his king, seem to have
been the motives of his inspiration."One night (methought) walking up
one of my Lord's lime-walks, I heard the grateful trees thus paying the
tribute of their thanks to his lordship:--

   Like pyramids our stately tops we'll raise,
   To sing our noble benefactor's praise;
   Freshly we will to after-ages show
   What noble Essex did on us bestow:
   For we our very being owe to him,
   Or else we had long since intombed been
   In crop of bird, or in beast's belly found,
   Or met our death neglected on the ground.By him we cherish'd were with dung and spade,
   For which we'll recompense him with our shade.And since his kindness saw us prun'd so well,
   We will requite him with our fragrant smell;
   In winter (as in gratitude is meet)
   We'll strew our humble leaves beneath his feet.Nay, in each tree, root, trunk, branch, all will be
   Proud to serve him and his posterity."And he thus invokes the stately oak, after enumerating many of the rich
commodities which this tree bears through our Thames:--

   Of silks and satins fine, to clothe the back;
   Of wines, Italian, French, and Spanish sack.*       *       *       *       *

   'T was faithful oak preserved our king, that we
   Might thence learn lessons of true loyalty.*       *       *       *       *

   When in salt seas Sir Francis Drake did steer,
   Sailing in oak he say'd one day i'th'year.His oak, which the terrestrial globe did measure,
   Through dangers led him t' honour, profit, pleasure.No wood like oak that grows upon the ground,
   To make our house and ships last long and sound;
   No oak like ours: by love to oak let's then
   Appear true subjects, and right Englishmen.ANTHONY LAWRENCE published in 4to.1677, Nurseries, Orchards, Profitable
Gardens, and Vineyards Encouraged.JOHN READ, "one of the earliest Scotch gardening writers."He wrote "The
Scotch Gardener," 1683, 4to.1766; to which
is added, a short Treatise of Forest Trees, by the Earl of Haddington.J. GIBSON, who wrote A Short Account of several Gardens near London, as
viewed in 1681, in vol.T. LANGFORD wrote Plain and Full Instructions to raise all sorts of
Fruit Trees that prosper in England; with Directions for making Liquors
of all sorts of Fruits; 8vo.To the second edition, in 1696, is
prefixed a very handsome epistle from Mr.Evelyn, in which he says, "As
I know nothing extant that exceeds it, so nor do I of any thing which
needs be added to it."Also,

The Practical Planter of Fruit Trees; 8vo.Also, Systemae
Agriculturae, being the Mystery of Husbandry Discovered; folio, 1681.LEONARD MEAGER'S Portrait perhaps we may not be very desirous to
discover, when he tells his readers, neither to "sow, plant, nor graft,
or meddle with any thing relating to gardening, when the sun or moon is
eclipsed, or on that day, nor when the moon is afflicted by either of
the unfortunate planets, viz."[36] His English Gardner,
in 4to.with cuts, came out in 1683; the ninth edition came out in 1699,
4to.; it contains several clearly pointed plates of knots, or parterres.Meager also published The New Art of Gardening, with the Gardener's
Almanack; 8vo.1697; and

The Mystery of Husbandry; 12mo.The many editions that came out of Meager's English Gardner,
sufficiently shews the estimation in which his book was held.GEORGE LONDON and HENRY WISE, so eminent in their day, that, as a
contemporary says, "If the stock of their nurseries at Brompton Park,
were valued at one penny a plant, the amount would exceed L40,000.Evelyn declares, that we may place the above nursery above the greatest
works of that kind ever seen or heard of, either in books or travels."Evelyn again calls it "that vast ample collection which I have
lately seen, and well considered, at Brompton Park; the very sight of
which alone, gives an idea of something that is greater than I can well
express.One needs no more than to take a walk to Brompton Park, (on a
fair morning) to behold and admire what a magazine these industrious men
have provided."John Laurence, in his Clergyman's Recreation,
willingly attests their skill, integrity, and reputation, "so well
established amongst the nobility and gentry."London's grateful apprentice, Switzer, thus affectionately and
zealously records them in his History of Gardening, prefixed to his
Iconologia:--"But now let us look amongst the nobility and gentry, which
at this time were every where busied in making and adorning their
gardens and plantations.To enumerate and set down the history of
gardening in its several particulars in this reign, would require a
volume of itself, but will be for the most part summed up in the person
and character of _George London, Esq._ Superintendent of their Majesties
gardens, and Director-General of most of the gardens and plantations of
Great Britain.I am not well enough informed, neither is it material I
should go back to the birth and education of this eminent gardener; his
industry and natural parts soon and sufficiently recommended him to the
nobility and gentry, that he was _courted and caressed by all_; so true
it is, _That the gifts of nature are much more valuable than those of
original birth and fortune, or even learning itself_.And to the eternal
honour of the present age be it spoken, never was virtue, laudable
industry, nor art more encouraged, of which the person we are here
speaking of is an undeniable instance.I shall content myself therefore
to find him under the care and instruction of Mr._Rose_ (whose
character has been already drawn).The early and vigorous appearances he
made in business were soon discovered by his master, who spared no
pains, nor hindered him of any liberty, whereby he might improve
himself.After he had been with him about four or five years, he sent
him (if I am right informed) into France, the great seat of learning at
that time in the world, especially in the errand he went about.Soon
after he returned, he was preferred to the Bishop of London's service
before-mentioned; and, in a few years more, he (with his associates)
entered on that great undertaking of Brompton Park; and upon the
Revolution, was made superintendant of all their Majesties gardens, for
which he had L200.a year, and a Page of the Back Stairs to Queen Mary.Wise being joined partners, and thus, as it were,
both possessed of the royal favour, and the purses of the king, queen,
and nobility, left no stone unturned to carry on their designs.Soon
after the peace of Reswyck, Mr.London took another journey into France,
with the Right Honourable the Earl of Portland, that was sent, by King
William, Ambassador-Extraordinary on that occasion; and then it was that
he made those observations on the fruit gardens at Versailles, which are
published in the preface to their abridgement.After the death of the
Queen, and not many years after her the King, their royal successor,
Queen Anne, of pious memory, committed the care of her gardens in chief
to Mr.It
will perhaps be hardly believed in time to come, that this one person
actually saw and gave directions once or twice a year in most of the
noblemen's and gentlemen's gardens in England.And since it was common
for him to ride fifty or sixty miles in a day, he made his northern
circuit in five or six weeks, and sometimes less; and his western in as
little time; as for the south and east, they were but three or four
days' work for him; most times twice a year visiting all the country
seats, conversing with gentlemen, and forwarding the business of
gardening in such a degree as is almost impossible to describe.In the
mean time his colleague managed matters nearer home with a dexterity and
care equal to his character; and in truth they have deserved so much of
the world, that it is but common justice to transmit their memory to
ages to come.London was
supposed to be master of in this matter, the little opportunity he had
in laying a foundation of learning, was, without doubt, a great
obstruction to his progress in occult philosophy, which is involved in
so many hard terms; this, nevertheless, he overcame purely by industry;
and what he wanted in one, he abounded with in the other.He was
perfectly well skilled in fruit, which seemed to be his master-piece; as
for other parts, as greens, trees, flowers, exoticks, and the like, he
certainly had as much knowledge as any one man living; and though he
might not come up to the highest pitch of design always, yet that might
be attributed to the haste he was generally in; and it can be no great
blemish to his character, that he was not the greatest person in every
thing, when it is surprising to find he could possibly know so much; so
great a surprise indeed, that we must hardly ever expect his equal, much
less any one that will exceed him.The planting and raising of all sorts
of trees is so much due to this undertaking, that it will be hard for
any of posterity to lay their hands on a tree in any of these kingdoms,
that have not been a part of their care.London, by his great
fatigues in heat and cold, notwithstanding naturally of a healthy,
strong constitution, was at last seized with an illness, which carried
him off after a few months' sickness.I shall take no other notice of
him than what relates to my purpose in gardening, in which he has left a
laudable example to all that shall have the encouragement to enter, and
the courage and strength to perform what he did.He died towards
Christmas in the year 1713."In the preface to his Iconologia, he again mentions them:--"Had their
leisure been equal to their experience, the world might from them have
reasonably expected the compleatest System of Gardening that any age or
country has produced.It is to them we owe most of those valuable
precepts in gardening now in use, and their memory ought to be
transmitted to posterity, with the same care as those of the greatest
and most laborious philosophers and heroes, who by their writing and
practice have deserved so well of the world."London:--"In fine, he was the
person that refined the business and pleasure of kitchen and fruit
gardens to a pitch beyond what was ever till that time seen, and more
than was thought possible for one man ever to do; and (till the
succession of two eminent persons in these kingdoms, who have very much
outstript him) has not had his fellow in any century that history gives
us account of."Compton, Bishop of London, says, "He was a
great encourager of Mr.London, and probably very much assisted him in
his great designs.This reverend father was one of the first that
encouraged the importation, raising and increase of exoticks, in which
he was the most curious man in that time, or perhaps will be in any
age.He had above one thousand species of exotick plants in his stoves
and gardens."No monument has, I believe, been erected to Mr.London's memory,
deservedly eminent and esteemed as he was in his day, _courted and
caressed by all_, nor can I find out even where he was born or buried.If one could obtain a resemblance of him, one hopes his Picture, or his
Bust, may not deserve the censure of our noble poet:

   What is the end of fame?'tis but to fill
   A certain portion of uncertain paper;

       *       *       *       *       *

   To have, when the original is dust,
   A name, a wretched _picture_, and worse _bust_.[37]

The two following works were published by them:--

The Complete Gardener, &c. by Mons.Now compendiously
abridged, and made of more use; with very considerable Improvements.To which is prefixed, An Address to the
Nobility and Gentry, by J. Evelyn, Esq.; folio, 1693; octavo, 1699,
1717.There is a curious plate of a garden
prefixed, and two neat ones at page 22.Evelyn wrote this Address purposely to recommend their "extraordinary
and rare industry."And he also wrote the Preliminary Discourse to that
part which relates to Fruit-trees, wherein he thus breaks out:--"Let us
but take a turn or two in a well-contrived and planted garden; and see
what a surprising scene presents itself in the vernal bloom, diffusing
its fragrant and odoriferous wafts, with their ravishing sweets; the
tender blossoms curiously enamelled; the variously-figured shapes of the
verdant foliage, dancing about, and immantling the laden branches of the
choicest fruit; some hiding their blushing cheeks; others displaying
their beauties, and even courting the eye to admire; others the hand to
gather, and all of them to taste their delicious pulps.Can any thing be
more delightful, than to behold an ample square (in a benign aspect)
tapestried and adorned with such a glorious embroidery of festoons, and
fruitages, depending from the yielding boughs, pregnant with their
offspring, and pouring forth their plenty and store, as out of so many
Amalthean horns?Some tinctured with the loveliest white and red; others
an azurine-purple; others striped with an incarnadine, as over a tissue
of vegetable gold.Colours of an oriency, that mock the pencil of the
most exquisite artist; and with which their native beauty, perfume,
fragrancy, and taste, gratify and entertain more senses at once, than
does any sublunary object in all unvitiated nature besides."Their other Work was thus announced in one of the original numbers of
the Spectator, which came out in small folio weekly numbers, and a
portion of each number was appropriated to advertisements.It was thus
advertised in that of May 5th, 1711:--"The Retired Gardener.i.
Being a Translation of Le Jardinier Solitaire; or, Dialogues between a
Gentleman and a Gardener: containing the methods of making, ordering,
and improving a fruit and kitchen garden; together with the manner of
planting and cultivating flowers, plants, and shrubs, necessary for the
adorning of gardens, &c. Vol.containing the manner of planting and
cultivating all sorts of flowers, plants, and shrubs, necessary for the
adorning of gardens; in which is explained, the art of making and
disposing of parterres, arbours of greens, wood works, arches, columns,
and other pieces and compartments usually found in the most beautiful
gardens of country seats.The whole enriched with variety of Figures,
being a Translation from the Sieur Louis Liger.To this volume is added,
a Description and Plan of Count Tallard's Garden, at Nottingham.The
whole revised by George London and Henry Wise.Printed for Jacob Tonson,
at Shakspeare's Head, over against Catherine-street in the Strand."This
book, after giving the mode of culture of most flowers, generally gives
what the author calls _its history_.I will merely give its history of
one flower:--"On a day when they were keeping holiday in heaven, Flora
summoned all the deities that preside over gardens, and, when they were
met, addressed herself to them in this manner: 'You, who have always
been the shining ornaments of my court, I have now called together, to
consult in a matter of great importance.I know I am the sovereign of
all the flowery kind; but for the more firm establishment of my empire,
I am thinking to choose them a Queen of a spotless and unblemished
reputation; but will do nothing of this nature without your counsel and
assistance.'To these words, all the deities that were present, having
first filled the court with murmurs, answered in this manner: 'Great
goddess, be pleased to reflect a little on the animosities such a choice
may create among the rival flowers; even the worthless Thistle will
pretend to deserve the crown, and if denied, will perhaps grow factious,
and disturb your peaceful reign.''Your fears are groundless,' replied
the goddess; 'I apprehend no such consequence; my resolution is already
fixed; hear, therefore, what I have determined:--In the deep recesses of
a wood, where formerly the oaks were vocal, and pronounced oracles to
mortals, at the foot of a little hill is a grotto, whose structure is
nature's master-piece, there a wood nymph passed her quiet days; she was
extremely beautiful, and charmed all that beheld her; her looks, her
mien, and her behaviour had something of more than human; and indeed she
was the daughter of a Dryad, and of a sylvan god.Her chastity and
devotion equalled her beauty, she was perfectly resigned to the will of
heaven, and never undertook any thing without having first implored our
assistance; her heart was pure, and her hands undefiled.This nymph is
dead, and my intention is to raise a flower from her precious remains,
to be Queen of all the flowery race.The applauding gods straight
prepared for the ceremony; _Priapus_ put on a grave countenance;
_Vertumnus_ loaded himself with perfumes of an excellent scent; _Pomona_
heaped up canisters with all sorts of richest fruits; _Venus_ was
attended with a train of smiles and graces; _Vesta_ promised wonders;
and _Bacchus_ supplied rivers of nectar, and crowned vast goblets with
that divine liquor.In this equipage they left their celestial mansions,
and repaired to the grotto, where they saw the dead body of the nymph
stretched along on a soft couch of turf, and approaching it with
profound awe and silence, prepared to pay the sacred rites; and Flora,
having thrice bowed herself to the ground, was heard to pronounce this
prayer:--'Almighty Jupiter, great ruler of the universe, exert thy
creating power, and from the dead corpse of this lovely nymph let a
plant arise, and bear no less lovely flowers, to be Queen of all thou
hast already created.'Scarce had she made an end, when, behold a
wondrous change!The nymph's extended limbs were turned into branches,
and her hair into leaves; a shrub sprung up, adorned with sprouting
buds, which straight unfolding, disclosed a fragrant and vermilion
flower; a sudden light filled all the grotto, and the well-pleased
goddess breathed thrice on the new-born babe, to spread it into life,
and give it an odorous soul.Then seeing the vegetable Queen adorned
with every grace, she kissed her thrice, and, breaking the general
silence, revealed her secret joy.'Approach,' said she, 'at my command,
oh, all ye flowers, and pay your grateful homage to your Queen, the
ROSE, for that is the name I give her.'Then taking a crown in her hand,
that had been made on purpose in heaven, she placed it on the head of
the new-made majesty; while to complete the ceremony, the attending gods
sung joyful _Io Paeans_, amidst a symphony of flutes, harps, and all
other tuneful instruments, with which the air resounded, while Flora and
her bright celestial train ascended back rejoicing into heaven."[38]


JOHN JAMES, who translated Le Blond's "Theory and Practice of Gardening,
wherein is fully handled all that relates to fine gardens, commonly
called Pleasure-gardens," cuts, 4to.M. STEVENSON published in small 4to.1661, a book called The Twelve
Months, being a Treatise on Husbandry and Gardening.HENRY STEVENSON, of East Retford, published "The Young
Gardener's Director," 1716, 12mo.Evelyn's advice
as to having salads in each month.There is a neat cut of flower-knots,
and the frontispiece exhibits a curious old garden.In the preface he
says, "not to mention the profit to a family, nothing conduces more to a
man's health, especially to one that lives a sedentary life.If these
observations and experiments I have made in gardening, be of use to any
by drawing him to a way of diversion that will preserve his health, and
perhaps put him upon a meditation on the great works of the creation,
let him give the Creator the praise."He also published "The Gentleman
Gardener Instructed;" eighth edition, 12mo.DAVID STEVENSON, in 1746, published in 12mo.STEPHEN SWITZER, of whose private history so very little is known, but
whose works shew him to have been an honest, unassuming, humane,
religious, most industrious, and ingenious man.We only know that he had
a garden on Milbank, and another _near_ Vauxhall; and that he died, I
believe, about 1745.He dates his Letter on the Cythesis, from New
Palace Yard, 1730.He was a native of _Hampshire_; for in his Fruit
Gardener, speaking of walnut-trees, he says, "The best I ever saw are
those that grow upon chalk.Such are those that grow about _Ewell_, near
_Epsom_, and in many places of my own native county of _Hampshire_,
there being one cut down some few years ago in the Park belonging to the
Right Honourable the Lady _Russell_, at _Stratton_, that did spread, at
least, fifty yards diameter."He acknowledges, without murmuring, his
meanness of fortune, and his having industriously submitted "to the
meanest labours of the scythe, spade, and wheel-barrow."He became,
however, eminent in his day, and added much to the beauty and
magnificence of the gardens of many of our chief nobility and gentry.He
wrote a history of the art he so loved, and therefore his classic
History of Gardening, prefixed to his Ichnographia Rustica, merits the
perusal of every one attached to gardens; and paints in strong colours
his own devotion to that art; and which he thus concludes:--"In short,
next to the more immediate duties of religion, 'tis in the innocency of
these employs, thus doing, thus planting, dressing, and busying
themselves, that all wise and intelligent persons would be found, when
Death, the king of terrors, shall close their eyes, and they themselves
be obliged to bid an eternal farewell to these and all other sublunary
pleasures;" and he who was thus fond of breathing the sweet and fragrant
air of gardens, thus expresses his own (perhaps expiring) wish in the
lines of Cowley:

   Sweet shades, adieu!here let my dust remain,
   Covered with flowers, and free from noise and pain;
   Let evergreens the turfy tomb adorn,
   And roseate dews (the glory of the morn)
   My carpet deck; then let my soul possess
   The happier scenes of an eternal bliss.He asks "What solid pleasure is there not to be found in gardening?Its
pursuit is easy, quiet, and such as put neither the body nor mind into
those violent agitations, or precipitate and imminent dangers that many
other exercises (in themselves very warrantable) do.The end of this is
health, peace, and plenty, and the happy prospect of felicities more
durable than any thing in these sublunary regions, and to which this is
(next to the duties of religion) the surest path."His attachment to
some of our own poets, and to the classic authors of antiquity,
discovers itself in many of his pages; and his devout turn of mind
strongly shines throughout.page 7,
sufficiently shews how ardently this industrious servant, this barrow
wheeler, must have searched the great writers of ancient times, to
discover their attachment to rural nature, and to gardens.His candid
and submissive mind thus speaks:--"If we would, therefore, arrive at any
greater perfection than we are in gardening, we must cashiere that
mathematical stiffness in our gardens, and imitate nature more; how that
is to be done, will appear in the following chapters, which though they
may not be, as new designs scarce ever are, the most perfect, it will at
least excite some after-master to take pen and pencil in hand, and
finish what is here thus imperfectly begun, and this is my comfort, that
I shall envy no man that does it.I have, God be praised, learned to
admire, and not envy every one that outgoes me: and this will, I hope,
go a great way in making me easy and happy under the pressures of a very
narrow fortune, and amidst the ruffles of an ill-natured world.I have
tasted too severely of the lashes of man, to take any great
satisfaction in any thing but doing my duty."[39] In his devout and
magnificent Essay on the Sun, he says, "'tis admirable that this planet
should, through so many ages of the world, maintain an uninterrupted
course, that in so many thousands of revolving years, it should retain
the same light, heat, and vigour, and every morning renew its wonted
alacrity, and dart its cherishing beams on these dull and gloomy scenes
of melancholy and misery, and yet that so few of us rightly consider its
power, or are thankful to Divine Omnipotence for it.The great Roscommon
(not greater than good) speaks of it with divine transport, and exhorts
mankind to admire it, from the benefits and celestial beams it displays
on the world:--

   Great eye of all, whose glorious ray
   Rules the bright empire of the day;
   O praise his name, without whose purer light
   Thou hadst been hid in an abyss of night."[40]

Switzer (as appears from the Preface to his Iconologia) was so struck
with the business and pleasures of a country life, that he collected, or
meant to collect, whatever he could respecting this subject, scattered
up and down as they were in loose irregular papers and books; but this
work, we regret to say, never made its appearance.That he would have
done this well, may be guessed at from so many of his pages recording
what he calls "the eternal duration" of Virgil's works, or those of "the
noble and majestic" Milton:--

   Flowers worthy of Paradise, which no nice art
   In beds, and curious knots, but nature boon
   Pour'd forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain.Though prim regularity, and "parterres embroidered like a petticoat,"
were in his time in high vogue, yet his pages shew his enlarged views on
this subject, and the magnificent ideas he had formed, by surrounding
them by rural enclosures, (probably by reading Mr.Addison), perfumed
with blossoms, and bespangled with the rich tufts of nature.Nothing, he
says, is now so much wanted to complete the grandeur of the British
nation, as noble and magnificent gardens, statues, and water-works; long
extended shady walks, and groves, and the adjacent country laid open to
view, and not bounded by high walls.The pleasant fields, and paddocks,
in all the beautiful attire of nature, would then appear to be a part of
it, and look as if the adjacent country were all a garden.Walls take
away the rural aspect of any seat; wood, water, and such like, being the
noble and magnificent decorations of a country villa.Switzer calls
water the spirit and most enchanting beauty of nature.He is so struck
with "the beautifulness and nobleness of terrace walks," and
particularly with that truly magnificent and noble one, belonging to the
Right Honourable the Earl of Nottingham, at _Burleigh-on-the-Hill_, that
"for my own part I must confess, that that design creates an idea in my
mind greater than I am well able to express."In his chapter of "Woods
and Groves," he enforces "a particular regard to large old oaks, beech,
and such like trees; in which case, one would as soon fire one's house,
as cut them down, since it is the work of so many years, I may say ages,
to rear them; those ancient trees which our forefathers had all along
preserved with much care."[41] In some of the romantic embellishments
which he proposed in the midst of a grove, or coppice, he hints at
having "little gardens, with caves, little natural cascades and grotts
of water, with seats, and arbors of honeysuckles and jessamine, and, in
short, with all the varieties that nature and art can furnish."He
advises "little walks and paths running through such pastures as adjoin
the gardens, passing through little paddocks, and corn fields, sometimes
through wild coppices, and gardens, and sometimes by purling brooks, and
streams; places that are set off not by _nice art_, but by luxury of
nature."And again, "these hedge-rows mixed with primroses, violets, and
such natural sweet and pleasant flowers; the walks that thus lead
through them, will afford as much pleasure, nay, more so, than the
largest walk in the most magnificent and elaborate fine garden."[42] He
concludes his interesting Chapter of Woods and Coppices, with these
lines of Tickell:--

   Sweet solitude!when life's gay hours are past,
   Howe'er we range, in thee we fix at last:
   Tost thro' tempestuous seas, the voyage o'er,
   Pale we look back, and bless the friendly shore.Our own strict judges, our past life we scan,
   And ask if glory have enlarg'd the span.If bright the prospect, we the grave defy,
   Trust future ages, and contented die.The following appear to have been his works:--

     1.The Nobleman, Gentleman, and Gardener's Recreation; or an
     Introduction to Gardening, Planting, Agriculture, and the other
     Business and Pleasures of a Country Life.By Stephen Switzer; 1715,
     8vo.The year afterwards, it was
     published with the following title:--

     2.Icknographia Rustica; or, the Nobleman, Gentleman, and
     Gardener's Recreation: containing Directions for the general
     Distribution of a Country Seat into rural and extensive Gardens,
     Parks, Paddocks, &c.; and a General System of Agriculture;
     illustrated by a great variety of Copperplates, done by the first
     hands, _from the Author's Drawings_.By Stephen Switzer, Gardener:
     several years Servant to Mr.A Compendious Method for Raising Italian Brocoli, Cardoon,
     Celeriac, and other Foreign Kitchen Vegetables; as also an Account
     of Lucerne, St.Foyne, Clover, and other Grass Seeds, with the
     Method of Burning of Clay; 8vo.[43]

     4.An Introduction to a General System of Hydrostaticks and
     Hydraulicks, wherein the most advantageous Methods of Watering
     Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Seats, Buildings, Gardens, &c. are laid
     down.With Sixty Copper Cuts of Rural and Grotesque Designs for
     Reservoirs, Cataracts, Cascades, Fountains, &c.; 2 vols.[44]

     5.A Dissertation on the True Cythesus of the Ancients; 8vo.1731;
     1s.At the end, he gives a Catalogue of
     the Seeds, &c. sold by him at the Flower-pot, _over against the
     Court of Common Pleas, in Westminster; or at his garden on
     Millbank_.[45]

     6.Country Gentleman's Companion, or Ancient Husbandry Restored,
     and Modern Husbandry Improved; 8vo.Switzer was the chief conductor of Monthly Papers on
     Agriculture, in 2 vols.8vo., and he himself designed the Two
     Frontispieces.To be sold at his Seed Shop _in Westminster Hall_.The Practical Fruit Gardener; 8vo.Other editions,
     8vo.1724, 1731, Revised and recommended by the Rev.Lawrence
     and Mr.Bradley, with their Two Letters of Recommendation.In this later edition of 1731, are a few additions.In one of its
concluding chapters, he mentions "my worthy and ingenious friend, Sir
James Thornhill."This pleasing volume, after stating the excellency of
fruits, observes, "if fruit trees had no other advantage attending them
than to _look_ upon them, how pleasurable would _that_ be?Since there
is no flowering shrub excels, if equals that of a _peach_, or _apple
tree_ in bloom.The tender enamelled blossoms, verdant foliage, with
such a glorious embroidery of festoons and fruitages, wafting their
odours on every blast of wind, and at last bowing down their laden
branches, ready to yield their pregnant offspring into the hands of
their laborious planter and owner."[46]


JOHN TAVERNER published, in 1660, a little Treatise, called The Making
of Fish Ponds, Breeding Fish, and _Planting Fruits_.Printed several
times, says Wood, in his Athenae.The Encyclopaedia of Gardening pronounces him "a popular
writer of very considerable talent, and indefatigable industry;" and
speaks highly of the interesting knowledge diffused through his very
numerous works, and gives a distinct list of them; so does Mr.Nicholls,
in his Life of Bowyer; and Mr.Weston, in his Tracts, and Dr.Bradley's "New Improvements of Planting and
Gardening," he has added the whole of that scarce Tract of Dr.Beale's,
the _Herefordshire Orchards_.One could wish to obtain his portrait,
were it only from his pen so well painting the alluring charms of
flowers:--"_Primroses_ and _Cowslips_, may be planted near the edges of
borders, and near houses, for the sake of their pretty smell.I
recommend the planting some of the common sorts that grow wild in the
woods, in some of the most rural places about the house; for I think
nothing can be more delightful, than to see great numbers of these
flowers, accompanied with _Violets_, growing under the hedges, avenues
of trees, and wilderness works._Violets_, besides their beauty, perfume
the air with a most delightful odour.Bradley, it appears, from
the Fruit Garden Kalendar, of the Rev.Lawrence, resided at Camden
House, Kensington.They each of them in their letters, in 1717,
subscribe themselves, "Your most affectionate friend."Lawrence
frequently styles him "the most ingenious Mr.Pulteney
says he "was the author of more than twenty separate publications,
chiefly on Gardening and Agriculture; published between the years 1716
and 1730.His 'New Improvement of Planting and Gardening, both
Philosophical and Practical,' 8vo.1717, went through repeated
impressions; as did his 'Gentleman's and Gardener's Kalendar,' (which
was the fourth part of the preceding book) both at home, and in
translations abroad.His 'Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature,'
4to.1721, was a popular, instructive, and entertaining work, and
continued in repute several years.The same may be said of his 'General
Treatise of Husbandry and Gardening,' 8vo.1726; and of his
'Practical Discourses concerning the Four Elements, as they relate to
the Growth of Plants,' 8vo.His '_Dictionarium Botanicum_,' 8vo.1728, was, I believe, the first attempt of the kind in England."On the
whole (says Dr.Pulteney) Bradley's writings, coinciding with the
growing taste for gardening, the introduction of exotics, and
improvements in husbandry, contributed to excite a more philosophical
view of these arts, and diffuse a general and popular knowledge of them
throughout the kingdom.Bradley has given at the end of his
curious "Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature," which is
embellished with neat engravings, a chapter "Of the most curious Gardens
in Europe, especially in Britain."In this chapter he justly observes,
that "a gentle exercise in a fresh air, where the mind is engaged with
variety of natural objects, contributes to content; and it is no new
observation, that the trouble of the mind wears and destroys the
constitution even of the most healthful body.All kinds of gardens
contribute to health."This volume also preserves the account of Lord
Ducie's noted old chesnut tree at Tortworth, supposed to be more than a
thousand years old; and of an elm belonging to his lordship, of a truly
gigantic growth.[49] Switzer thus speaks of Bradley:--"Mr.Bradley has
not only shewn himself a skilful botanist, but a man of experience in
other respects, and is every where a modest writer."Some writers have dwelt much upon his dissipation; let us
remember, however, that

   _Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues
   We write in water._

Mr.Weston, in a communication inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine for
November, 1806, says, "Although this country had a great loss by the
death of Evelyn, yet he was succeeded, in twenty years after, by another
of equal abilities, and indefatigable in endeavouring to improve the art
of gardening, as Bradley's numerous works will testify."TIMOTHY NOURSE, whose "Campania Foelix," 8vo.1700, has prefixed to
it, a very neat engraving by Vander Gucht, of rural life.He has
chapters on Fruit Trees; on the several kinds of Apple Trees, and on
Cyder and Perry.In page 262 he, with great humanity, strongly pleads to
acquit Lord Chancellor Bacon from the charge against him of corruption
in his high office.His Essay "Of a Country House," in this work, is
curious; particularly to those who wish to see the style of building,
and the decorations of a country seat at that period.Nourse also
published "A Discourse upon the Nature and Faculties of Man, with some
Considerations upon the Occurrences of Humane Life."Printed for Jacob
Tonson, at the Judge's Head, in Chancery-lane, 1686, 8vo.His chapter on
Solitude, wherein he descants on the delights of rural scenery and
gardens; and his conclusion, directing every man towards the attainment
of his own felicity, are worth perusing.That on Death is forcibly
written; he calls it "no more than for a man to close up all the
travails, pains, and misfortunes of life, with one sweet and eternal
sleep; he is now at everlasting rest; the fears and misery of poverty,
the anxieties of riches, the vexations of a process, do not devour him.He does not fear the calumnies of the base, nor the frowns of the great.'Tis death which delivers the prisoner from his fetters, and the slave
and captive from his chain; 'tis death which rescues the servant from
the endless toils of a laborious life, the poor from oppression, and
makes the beggar equal with princes.Here desperation finds a remedy,
all the languors of disease, all the frustrations and tediousness of
life, all the infirmities of age, all the disquiets of the passions, and
all the calamities of fortune, with whatever can make a man miserable,
vanish in these shades."In his very curious "Essay of a Country House,"
he thus moralizes:--"The variety of flowers, beautiful and fragrant,
with which his gardens are adorned, opening themselves, and dying one
after another, must admonish him of the fading state of earthly
pleasures, of the frailty of life, and of the succeeding generations to
which he must give place.The constant current of a fountain, or a
rivulet, must remind of the flux of time, which never returns."SAMUEL COLLINS, ESQ.of Archeton, Northamptonshire, author of "Paradise
Retrieved; 1717, 8vo.In the Preface to the Lady's Recreation, by
Charles Evelyn, Esq.he is extremely severe on this "Squire Collins,"
whom he accuses of ignorance and arrogance.JOHN EVELYN, son of the author of _Sylva_.His genius early displayed
itself; for when little more than fifteen, he wrote a Greek poem, which
must have some merit, because his father has prefixed it to the second
edition of his _Sylva_.Nicoll's Collection of Poems, are some by
him.There are two poems of his in Dryden's Miscellany.He translated
Plutarch's Life of Alexander from the Greek; and the History of Two
Grand Viziers, from the French.When only nineteen, he translated from
the Latin, Rapin on Gardens.The Quarterly Review, in
its review of Mr.Bray's Memoirs of Evelyn, thus speaks of this son, and
of his father:--"It was his painful lot to follow to the grave his only
remaining son, in the forty-fourth year of his age, a man of much
ability and reputation, worthy to have supported the honour of his name.Notwithstanding these repeated sorrows, and the weight of nearly
fourscore years, Evelyn still enjoyed uninterrupted health, and
unimpaired faculties; he enjoyed also the friendship of the wise and the
good, and the general esteem beyond any other individual of his
age."[50]


THOMAS FAIRCHILD, whose garden and vineyard at Hoxton, Mr.Bradley
mentions in high terms, in numberless pages of his many works.I will
merely quote from one of his works, viz.from his Philosophical Account
of the Works of Nature:--"that curious garden of Mr.Thomas Fairchild,
at Hoxton, where I find the greatest collection of fruits that I have
yet seen, and so regularly disposed, both for order in time of ripening
and good pruning of the several kinds, that I do not know any person in
Europe to excel him in that particular; and in other things he is no
less happy in his choice of such curiosities, as a good judgement and
universal correspondence can procure."Fairchild published The City
Gardener; 8vo.He left
funds for a Botanical Sermon to be delivered annually at St.Leonard,
Shoreditch, on each Whitsun Tuesday, "On the wonderful works of God in
the creation, or on the certainty of the resurrection of the dead,
proved by the certain changes of the animal and vegetable parts of the
creation.Fairchild:--"My plan does
not allow me to deviate so far as to cite authors on the subject of
gardening, unless eminent for their acquaintance with English botany.Some have distinguished themselves in this way; and I cannot omit to
mention, with applause, the names of Fairchild, Knowlton, Gordon, and
Miller.The first of these made himself known to the Royal Society, by
some 'New Experiments relating to the different, and sometimes contrary
motion of the Sap;' which were printed in the Phil.He also assisted in making experiments, by which the sexes of plants
were illustrated, and the doctrine confirmed.Fairchild died in
November, 1729."GEORGE RICKETS, of Hoxton, was much noted about 1688 and 1689.Rea, in
his Flora, says of him, "Mr.Rickets, of Hogsden, often remembered, the
best and most faithful florist now about London."Rea describes, in his
Flora, one hundred and ninety different kinds of tulips, and says, "All
these tulips, and _many others_, may be had of Mr.Worlidge
thus speaks of him:--"he hath the greatest variety of the choicest
apples, pears, cherries, plums, apricots, peaches, malacolones,
noctorines, figgs, vines, currans, gooseberries, rasberries, mulberries,
medlars, walnuts, nuts, filberts, chesnuts, &c. that any man hath, and
can give the best account of their natures and excellencies."And again
he says, "the whole nation is obliged to the industry of the ingenious
Mr.George Rickets, gardner at Hoxton or Hogsden without Bishopsgate,
near London, at the sign of the Hand there; who can furnish any planter
with all or most of the fruit trees before mentioned, having been for
many years a most laborious and industrious collector of the best
species of all sorts of fruit from foreign parts.And hath also the
richest and most complete collection of all the great variety of
flower-bearing trees and shrubs in the kingdom.That there is not a day
in the year, but the trees, as well as the most humble plants, do there
yield ornaments for Flora; with all sorts of curious and pleasant
winter-greens, that seemed to perpetuate the spring and summer, from the
most humble myrtle, to the very true cedar of Libanus.Not without
infinite variety of tulips, auriculaes, anemones, gillyflowers, and
all other sorts of pleasant, and delicate flowers, that he may be truly
said to be the master-flowrist of England; and is ready to furnish any
ingenious person with any of his choicest plants."JOHN COWEL appears to have been a noted gardener at Hoxton, about 1729.He was the author of the "Curious and Profitable Gardener."of Pynes, in Devonshire, who published, in 1729, "A
Treatise on Cyder Making, with a Catalogue of Cyder Apples of Character;
to which is prefixed, a Dissertation on Cyder, and Cyder-Fruit."BENJAMIN WHITMILL, Sen.Gardeners at Hoxton, published the
sixth edition, in small 8vo.of their "Kalendarium Universale: or, the
Gardener's Universal Calendar."The following is part of their
Preface:--"The greatest persons, in all ages, have been desirous of a
country retirement, where every thing appears in its native simplicity.The inhabitants are religious, the fair sex modest, and every
countenance bears a picture of the heart.What, therefore, can be a more
elegant amusement, to a good and great man, than to inspect the
beautiful product of fields and gardens, when every month hath its
pleasing variety of plants and flowers.And if innocence be our greatest
happiness, where can we find it but in a country life?In fields and
gardens we have pleasures unenvied, and beauties unsought for; and any
discovery for the improvement of them, is highly praiseworthy.In the
growth of a plant, or a tree, we view the progress of nature, and ever
observe that all her works yield beauty and entertainment.To cultivate
this beauty, is a task becoming the wealthy, the polite, and the
learned; this is so generally understood, that there are few gentlemen
of late, who are not themselves their chief gardeners.And it certainly
redounds more to the honour and satisfaction of a gardener, that he is a
preserver and pruner of all sorts of fruit trees, than it does to the
happiness of the greatest general that he has been successful in killing
mankind."SAMUEL TROWEL, of Poplar, published, in 1739, A New Treatise of
Husbandry and Gardening; 12mo.This was translated in Germain,
at Leipsig, 1750, in 8vo.FRANCIS COVENTRY, who wrote an admirable paper in the _World_, (No.15,) on the absurd novelties introduced in gardens.He wrote Penshurst,
in Dodsley's Poems.published the "Scot's Gardener's Director," 8vo.A
new edition, entitled "The _British_ Gardener's Director, chiefly
adapted to the Climate of the Northern Counties," was published at
_Edinburgh_, 1764, 8vo.The Encyclopaedia of Gardening calls his book
"an original and truly valuable work;" and in page 87, 846, and 1104,
gives some interesting particulars of this gentleman's passion for
gardening.author of "The Fruit Gardener," to which he has
prefixed an interesting Preface on the Fruit Gardens of the Ancients.In
this Preface he also relates the origin of fruit gardens, by the
hermits, and monastic orders.In his Introduction, he says, that "every
kind of fruit tree seems to contend in spring, who shall best entertain
the possessor with the beauty of their blossoms.Mankind are always
happy with the prospect of plenty; in no other scene is it exhibited
with such charming variety, as in the fruit garden and orchard.Are
gentlemen fond of indulging their tastes?Nature, from the plentiful
productions of the above, regales them with a variety of the finest
flavours and exalted relishes.To cool us in the heat of summer, she
copiously unites the acid to an agreeable sweetness.Flowering shrubs
and trees are often purchased by gentlemen at a high price; yet not one
of them can compare in beauty with an _apple tree_, when beginning to
expand its blossoms."[52] Speaking of the greengage, he says, "its taste
is so exquisitely sweet and delicious, that nothing can exceed it."He
enlivens many of his sections on the cultivation of various fruits, by
frequent allusions to Theophrastus, Virgil, Pliny, and other _Rei
rustica scriptores_.His chapter on Pears, (the various kinds of which
possess "a profusion of sweets, heightened by an endless variety of
delicious flavours,") is particularly profuse.JAMES RUTTER published, in 1767, Modern Eden, or the Gardener's
Universal Guide; 8vo.JOHN DICKS published, in 1769, The New Gardener's Dictionary; in sixty
numbers, small folio, 30s.JAMES GARTON published, in 1769, The Practical Gardener; 8vo.---- WILDMAN published, in 1768, a Treatise on the Culture of Pear

Directions for Raising Melons.JAMES MEADER, Gardener at Sion House, and afterwards to the Empress
Catharine.He published, in 1771, in 12mo.The Modern Gardener, &c. in a
manner never before published; selected from the Diary MSS.Also, The Planter's Guide, or Pleasure Gardener's Companion;
with plates, 1779, oblong 4to.RICHARD WESTON, ESQ.an amateur gardener, who has given, at the end of
his "Tracts on Practical Agriculture, and Gardening," 1762, 8vo.a
Catalogue of English Authors on Agriculture, Gardening, &c. There is
another edition in 1773, with additions.His intelligent Catalogue is
brought down to the end of the year 1772.This volume of Tracts contains
an infinity of ingenious and curious articles.One of the chapters
contains "A Plan for Planting all the Turnpike Roads in England with
Timber Trees."[53] He most zealously wishes to encourage planting."I
believe (says this candid writer) that one of the principal reasons why
few persons plant, springs from a fearful conjecture that their days
will have been passed, before the forest can have risen.But let not the
parent harbour so selfish an idea; it should be his delight, to look
forward to the advantage which his children would receive from the
timber which he planted, contented if it flourished every year beneath
his inspection; surely there is much more pleasure in planting of trees,
than in cutting of them down.View but the place where a fine tree
stands, what an emblem does it afford of present beauty and of future
use; examine the spot after the noble ornament shall have been felled,
and see how desolate it will appear.Perhaps there is not a better
method of inducing youth to have an early inclination for planting,
than for fathers, who have a landed estate, to persuade those children
who are to inherit it, as soon as they come to years of discretion, to
make a small nursery, and to let them have the management of it
themselves; they will then see the trees yearly thriving under their
hands: as an encouragement to them, they should, when the trees are at a
fit growth to plant out, let them have the value of them for their
pocket money.This will, in their tender years, fix so strong an idea of
the value, and the great consequence of planting, as will never be
eradicated afterwards; and many youths, of the age of twenty-five,
having planted quick growing trees, may see the industry of their
juvenile years amply rewarded at that early age, a time when most young
men begin to know the value of money.Pope, in one of his
letters to Mr.Allen, thus discovers his own generous mind:--"I am now
as busy in planting for myself as I was lately in planting for another.I am pleased to think my trees will afford shade and fruit to others,
when I shall want them no more."Addison's admirable recommendation
of planting, forms No.He therein says, "When a
man considers that the putting a few twigs in the ground, is doing good
to one who will make his appearance in the world about fifty years
hence, or that he is perhaps making one of his own descendants easy or
rich, by so inconsiderable an expence; if he finds himself averse to it,
he must conclude that he has a poor and base heart.Most people are of
the humour of an old fellow of a college, who, when he was pressed by
the society to come into something that might redound to the good of
their successors, grew very peevish._We are always doing_, says he,
_something for posterity, but I would fain see posterity do something
for us._"[55] Mr.Weston also published The Universal Botanist and
Nursery; 1770, 1774, 4 vols.The Gardener and Planter's Calendar,
containing the Method of Raising Timber Trees, Fruit Trees, and Quicks
for Hedges; with Directions for Forming and Managing a Garden every
Month in the Year; also many New Improvements in the Art of Gardening;
8vo.Weston then appears to have lived at Kensington Gore.The
Gentleman's Magazine for November, 1806, says, that he died at
Leicester, in 1806, aged seventy-four.He was formerly a thread hosier
there.It gives an amusing and full list of his various publications,
particularly of his intended "Natural History of Strawberries."The best edition of his "Essay on Design in Gardening,"
appears to have been that of 1795, in 8vo.Two Appendixes were published
in 1798, which are said to have been written by Mr.Nichols's fourth volume of Illustrations of the Literary History of the
Eighteenth Century, are some particulars of Mr.He published
Hoccleve's Poems, with a Glossary; an Answer to Thomas Paine; the Life
of Lord Howe; a Supplement to Johnson's Dictionary: in the ill-tempered
preface to which, he thus strangely speaks of that Dictionary:--"this
muddiness of intellect sadly besmears and defaces almost every page of
the composition."This is only a small instance of his virulence against
Johnson in this preface.Mason's
sarcasms would have been softened, or even subdued, by its glowing and
eloquent preface, which informs us that this great work was composed
"without one act of assistance, one word of encouragement, or one smile
of favour."Mason, even in the above Essay,
discovers, in three instances, his animosity to our "Dictionary writer,"
for so he calls Dr.Boswell, speaking of Johnson's preface,
says, "We cannot contemplate without wonder, the vigorous and splendid
thoughts which so highly distinguish that performance;" and on the
Dictionary he observes, that "the world contemplated with wonder, so
stupendous a work, achieved by one man, while other countries had
thought such undertakings fit only for whole academies."Linnaeus and
Haller styled Ray's History of Plants, _opus immensi laboris_.One may
justly apply the same words to this Dictionary.Mason that he escaped (what Miss Seward called) "the dead-doing
broadside of Dr.George Mason omits no opportunity of
censuring Mr.Whateley's Observations on Modern Gardening.In the above
Essay, he censures him in seven different pages, and in his distinct
chapter or division on this book of Mr.Whateley's, (consisting of
thirteen pages) there are no less than thirty-three additional sneers,
or faults, found with his opinions.He does not acknowledge in him one
single solitary merit, except at page 191.In page 160, he nearly, if
not quite, calls him a _fool_, and declares that _vanity_ is the passion
to which he is constantly sacrificing.[56] It would be an insult to any
one who has read Mr.Whateley's work, to endeavour to clear him from
such a virulent and ill-founded attack.Johnson, with all
his deep learning, nor Mr.Whateley, with all the cultivated fancy of a
rich scholastic mind, would either of them have been able to comprehend,
or to understand, or even to make head or tail of the first half of Mr.George Mason's poem, with which he closes the above edition of his
Essay.As he has been so caustically severe against Dr.Johnson, it
cannot be ungenerous if one applies to the above part of his own poem,
the language of a French critic on another subject:--"Le style en est
dur, et scabreux.Il semble que l'auteur a ramasse les termes les plus
extraordinaires pour se rendre inintelligible."Percy, Bishop of
Dromore, in vol.x. page 602, of the British Critic, has given a
critique of Mr.Mason's edition of Hoccleve, in which he chastises its
injustice, arrogance, and ignorance.Mason has been more liberal in
warmly praising Kent, and Shenstone, in acknowledging the great taste
and elegance of Mr.Thomas Warton, when the latter notices Milton's line
of

   _Bosom'd high in tufted trees,_

which picturesque remark of Mr.Warton's could not have been excelled
even by the nice and critical pen of the late Sir U. Price; and when he
informs us, in more than one instance, of the great Earl of Chatham's
"turning his mind to the embellishment of rural nature."THOMAS WHATELEY, on whose "Observations on Modern Gardening," the
Encyclopaedia of Gardening (that most comprehensive assemblage of every
thing delightful and curious in this art,) observes, "It is remarkable,
that so little is known of a writer, the beauty of whose style, and the
justness of whose taste, are universally acknowledged."The same work
further says, "his excellent book, so frequently referred to by all
succeeding writers on garden scenery, ought to be in the hands of every
man of taste."And the same work still further observes, that "its style
has been pronounced by Ensor, inimitable, and the descriptions with
which his investigations are accompanied, have been largely copied, and
amply praised by Alison, in his work On Taste.The book was soon
translated into the continental languages, and is judiciously praised in
the _Mercure de France_, _Journal Encyclopedique_, and Weiland's
_Journal_.G. Mason alone dissents from the general opinion, enlarging
on the very few faults or peculiarities which are to be found in the
book.Wheatley, or Whately (for so little is known of this eminent man,
that we have never been able to ascertain satisfactorily the orthography
of his name,) was proprietor of Nonsuch Park, in Surrey; and was
secretary to the Earl of Suffolk.He published only this work, soon
after which he died.After his death, some remarks on Shakspeare, from
his pen, were published in a small 12mo."A second edition of this
elegant little work was published in 1808, by Parson, Oxford; or
Rivington, St.Paul's; in which, the advertisement to the reader informs
us, that "the respectable author intended to have gone through eight or
ten of the principal characters of Shakspeare, but suspended his design,
in order to finish his Observations on Modern Gardening, first published
in the year 1770; immediately after which time, _he was engaged in such
an active scene of public life_, as left him but little leisure to
attend to the Belles Lettres; and in the year 1772 he died."[57]

His remarks on some of the characters of Shakspeare (whom, in his
_Observations_, he calls _the great master of nature_) breathe in many
of his pages, that fire, which he could have caught only from those of
the great poet.Such was his eagerness to complete his _Observations_,
that he for a short while "suspended his design" of examining other
characters of the poet, when the bright effusions of his genius "fled up
to the stars from whence they came."This elegant little work is merely
a fragment, nay, even an unfinished fragment.It must, then, cause deep
regret, that death should so prematurely have deprived us of that rich
treasure of animated thoughts, which, no doubt, would have sprung from
his further tracing the poet's deep and piercing knowledge of the human
heart.Whateley, what he himself applies to
the poet:--"He had a genius to express all that his penetration could
discover."The Journal Encyclopedique, Juilliet, 1771, when speaking of
the French translation of Whateley's Observations, says, "On ne peut
gueres se faire une idee de ces jardins, si l'on n'a ete a Londres.Accoutumes a la symetrie des notres, nous n'imaginons pas qu'on puisse
etablir une forme irreguliere, comme une regle principale: cependant
ceux qui sentent combien la noble simplicite de la nature est superieure
a tous les rafinemens symetriques de l'art, donneront peuetetre la
preference aux jardins Anglois.C'est l'effet que doit produire la
lecture de cet ouvrage, qui quoique destine aux amateurs et aux
compositeurs des jardins, offre aux gens de gout, aux artistes et
sur-tout aux peintres, des observations fines et singulieres sur
plusieurs effets de perspective et sur les arts en general; aux
philosophes, des reflections justes sur les affections de notre ame; aux
poetes, des descriptions exactes, quoique vives, des plus beaux jardins
d'Angleterre dans tous les genres, qui decelent dans l'Auteur un oeil
infiment exerce, une grande connoissance des beaux arts, une belle
imagination et un esprit accoutume a penser."The "bloom of an orchard, the festivity of a hay field, and the carols
of harvest home," could not have met with a more cheerful and benevolent
pen than Mr.Whateley's; a love of country pervades many of his pages;
nor could any one have traced the placid scenery, or rich magnificence
of nature, with a happier pen than when he records the walk to the
cottage at Claremont, the grandeur and majesty of the scene at
_Blenheim_, or _Stowe_, _Persfield_, _Wotton_ in the vale of
Aylesbury--the rugged, savage, and craggy points of _Middleton Dale_, "a
chasm rent in the mountain by some convulsion of nature, beyond the
memory of man, or perhaps before the island was peopled," with its many
rills, springs, rivulets, and water-falls--the vast cliffs of rocks at
_Matlock_, _Bath_, that "scene of romantic magnificence; from such
scenes, probably, was conceived the wild imagination, in ancient
mythology, of the giants piling _Pelion_ upon _Ossa_; the loftiness of
the rocks, and the character of the _Derwent_, a torrent in which force
and fury prevail; the cascades in it are innumerable; before the water
is recovered from one fall, it is hurried down another; and its
agitation being thus increased by repeated shocks, it pushes on with
restless violence to the next, where it dashes against fragments of
rocks, or foams among heaps of stones which the stream has driven
together"--the dusky gloom at the iron forge, "close to the cascade of
the Weir, (between _Ross_ and _Monmouth_) where the agitation of the
current is increased by large fragments of rocks, which have been swept
down by floods from the banks, or shivered by tempests from the brow;
and the sullen sound, at stated intervals, from the strokes of the great
hammers in the forge, deadens the roar of the water-fall"--the solitude,
the loveliness, and the stillness of _Dovedale_, "the whole of which has
the air of enchantment; grotesque as chance can cast, wild as nature can
produce"--the monkish tomb-stones, and the monuments of benefactors long
since forgotten, which appear above the green sward, at _Tintern Abbey_,
with its maimed effigies, and sculpture worn with age and weather--his
view to the approach to Lord _Cadogan's_, near _Reading_--his feeling
and enchanting description of the _Leasowes_--"the wonderful efforts
which art has made at _Painshill_ to rival nature;" where the massy
richness of its hanging wood "gives an air of grandeur to the
whole"--the _Tinian_, and other lawns, and noble and magnificent views
in that vast sylvan scene _Hagley_, where, in a spot which once
delighted Mr.Pope, is inscribed an urn to his memory, "which, when
shewn by a gleam of moonlight through the trees, fixes that
thoughtfulness and composure to which the mind is insensibly led by the
rest of this elegant scene."His section "Of the Seasons," where he descants on the _spirit_ of the
morning, the _excess_ of noon, or the _temperance_ of evening," must
strike every one by its felicity of style; and the reader may judge of
the rich pages which this book contains, even from what he says of
water:--"It accommodates itself to every situation; is the most
interesting object in a landscape, and the happiest circumstance in a
retired recess; captivates the eye at a distance, invites approach, and
is delightful when near; it refreshes an open exposure; it animates a
shade; cheers the dreariness of a waste, and enriches the most crowded
view; in form, in style, and in extent, may be made equal to the
greatest compositions, or adapted to the least; it may spread in a calm
expanse to soothe the tranquillity of a peaceful scene; or hurrying
along a devious course, add splendour to a gay, and extravagance to a
romantic, situation.So various are the characters which water can
assume, that there is scarcely an idea in which it may not concur, or an
impression which it cannot enforce; a deep stagnated pool, dank and dark
with shades which it dimly reflects, befits the seat of melancholy; even
a river, if it be sunk between two dismal banks, and dull both in motion
and colour, is like a hollow eye which deadens the countenance; and over
a sluggard, silent stream, creeping heavily along all together, hangs a
gloom, which no art can dissipate, nor even the sunshine disperse.A
gently murmuring rill, clear and shallow, just gurgling, just dimpling,
imposing silence, suits with solitude, and leads to meditation; a
brisker current, which wantons in little eddies over a bright sandy
bottom, or babbles among pebbles, spreads cheerfulness all around; a
greater rapidity, and more agitation, to a certain degree are animating;
but in excess, instead of wakening, they alarm the senses; the roar and
the rage of a torrent, its force, its violence, its impetuosity, tend to
inspire terror; that terror, which, whether as cause or effect, is so
nearly allied to sublimity."[58]


DANIEL MALTHUS, ESQ.purchased, in 1759, the Rookery, near Dorking,
noted for its beauties of hill, dale, wood, and water; he sold it in
1768.He translated Gerardin, _De la Composition des Paysages_, 12mo.1783, to which he prefixed a preface, being, chiefly, remarks on what
the gardens of the Greeks and Romans were; a view of Rosseau's tomb is
prefixed.Malthus justly observes, that this Essay "is full of the
most insinuating eloquence, that it is wrote by the friend of Rousseau,
and from scenes which realize some of its most beautiful descriptions."He further observes, that "trifling as this enquiry will appear in
itself, it may add something towards the benevolent purpose of M.
d'Ernonville, which is to make men sensible of the exhaustless charms of
nature, to lead them back to their simple and original tastes, to
promote the variety and resources of a country life, and to unite its
usefulness with its embellishment."[59]


JOHN KENNEDY published a Treatise upon Planting, Gardening, &c.N. SWINDEN, "an ingenious gardener and seedsman at Brentford-End,"
wrote The Beauties of Flora Displayed; 8vo.SAMUEL FULMER wrote The Young Gardener's Best Companion for the Kitchen,
and Fruit Garden; 12mo.CHARLES BRYANT published Flora Dietetica; or, the History of Esculent
Plants: 8vo.Also, a Dictionary of Ornamental Trees, Shrubs, and
Plants; 8vo.JOSEPH HEELEY, ESQ.author of Letters on the Beauties of Hagley, Envil,
and the Leasowes; with Critical Remarks on the Modern Taste in
Gardening; 1777, 2 vols.THOMAS KYLE, or KEIL, "one of the first gardeners in Scotland, of his
time," published a Treatise on the Management of the Peach and Nectarine
Trees: to which is added, the Method of Raising and Forcing Vines; 8vo.WILLIAM MARSHALL, ESQ.who, in his "Planting and Rural Ornament," has
very properly transcribed the whole of that masterly production of Mr.Walpole's pen, his _History of the Modern Taste in Gardening_.He
observes, that "a pen guided by so masterly a hand, must ever be
productive of information and entertainment, when employed upon a
subject so truly interesting.Desirous of conveying to our readers all
the information which we can compress, with propriety, within the limits
of our plan, we wished to have given the _substance_ of this valuable
paper; but finding it already in the language of simplicity, and being
aware of the mischiefs which generally ensue in _meddling_ with the
productions of genius, we had only one alternative: either wholly to
transcribe, or wholly to reject."Marshall, alluding to the above
work of his, says, "Wheatley, Mason, and Nature, with some Experience,
and much Observation, are the principal sources from which this part of
our work was drawn; it was planned, and in part written, among the
magnificent scenes of nature, in Monmouthshire, Herefordshire, and
Gloucestershire, where the rich and the romantic are happily blended, in
a manner unparalleled in any other part of the island."In this same
work is preserved, Mr.Gray's letter on the scenery of _Grasmere Water_.His descriptions of many trees and shrubs are extremely interesting; and
he has rendered them more so by his frequent quotations from Mr.The Rural Economy of the Southern
Counties; 2 vols.--of the Midland Counties, 2 vols.--of Gloucestershire,
2 vols.--of Norfolk, 2 vols.--of Yorkshire, 2 vols.--Agriculture of the
Southern Counties, 2 vols.--Minutes of Agriculture--and a Review of the
Landscape, a didactic poem--and of an Essay on the Picturesque.of Gardening, after relating varied information respecting
him, says, that he "finally retired to a considerable property he
possessed in his native county, in the Vale of Cleveland, in 1808, where
he died, at an advanced age, in 1819.He was a man of little education,
but of a strong and steady mind: and pursued, in the most consistent
manner, from the year 1780 to his death, the plan he originally laid
down; that of collecting and condensing the agricultural practices of
the different counties of England, with a view to a general work on
Landed Property, which he published; another on Agriculture, which he
did not live to complete, and a _Rural Institute_, in which he was
supplanted by the Board of Agriculture."His observations on the
_Larch_, in vol.i. of his "Planting and Rural Ornament," and the zeal
with which he recommends the planting of it on the infertile heathy
flats of Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, on the bleak and barren heights
of Yorkshire, Westmoreland, Cornwall, and Devon, and on the Welch and
Salopean hills; and the powerful language with which he enforces its
valuable qualities, merit the attention of every man of property.WILLIAM SPEECHLY.He wrote Hints on Domestic Rural Economy; 8vo.On the
Culture of the Vine and Pine Apple, with Hints on the Formation of
Vineyards in England.On the Culture of the Pine Apple, and the
Management of the Hot-House; 8vo.He made a tour in Holland, chiefly to
observe the Dutch mode of cultivating the Pine, and the Grape.calls him "the Moses of modern British vine
dressers;" and in the Gardener's Magazine for January, 1828, has given
an interesting and honourable character of him.He died at Great Milton,
in 1819, aged eighty-six.[60] Marshall, in his Planting and Rural
Ornament, has given us Mr.Speechley's sensible letter on the Duke of
Portland's Plantations.Johnson says "he perhaps surpassed every
practical gardener of his age."PHILIP LE BROCQ, chaplain to the Duke of Gloucester, wrote,

1, A Description of Certain Methods of Planting, Training, and Managing
all Kinds of Fruit Trees, Vines, &c. London, 8vo.2, Sketch of a Plan for making the New Forest, a Real Forest.WALTER NICHOL, whom Mr.Loudon, in his Encyclopaedia, calls an author of
merit, and informs us that Mr.Nichol, "in the year 1810, undertook an
extensive journey through England, for the purpose of visiting the
principal seats and plantations, with a view, on his return, to compose
the _Planter's Calendar_.This work had scarcely commenced, when he was
seized with an illness which carried him off suddenly, in March, 1811."His works appear to be the following:--

The Gardener's Kalendar; or, Monthly Directory of every Branch of
Horticulture; 8vo.The Planter's Kalendar; or, the Nurseryman's and Forester's Guide; 8vo.The Villa Garden Directory; or, Monthly Index of Work to be done in
Gardens, Shrubberies, &c.; 12mo.Scotch Forcing Gardener; 8vo.Johnson says "his works are of the first authority, and rank as the
equals of those of Abercrombie, being the result of long practice during
an enlightened era of our art."JAMES MADDOCK, of the Society of Friends, and commercial florist, at
Walworth, where, about the middle of last century, he established the
florist garden there, now belonging to Milliken and Curtis.He published the Florist's Directory, and Complete Treatise
on the Culture of Flowers; 8vo.THOMAS S. D. BUCKNALL, Esq.published the Orchardist; extracted from the
Society's Trans.for the Encouragement of Arts, &c.; _with additions_.I had omitted the following, for which I am indebted to Mr.Johnson's
History of English Gardening:--

RICHARD RICHARDSON.Of either of the above enumerated Authors on Gardening, I have not been
able to discover any Portrait.[Illustration]

   Of the following we _have_ Portraits:--

LEONARD MASCALL'S portrait appears at the bottom of the curious title
page to his "Government of Cattle," 4to.He published,
in 1572, "The New Art of Planting and Grafting;" 4to.WILLIAM BULLEYN practised physic at Durham.He had
the misfortune to lose great part of his library by shipwreck.He was
thrown into prison for debt, where he wrote a great part of his medical
treatises.Bishop Tanner says he was a man of acute judgment, and true
piety.He was universally esteemed as a polished scholar, and as a man
of probity, benevolence, and piety.Pulteney:--"Of Dr.Bulleyn there is a profile with a long beard, before
his "Government of Health," and a whole length of him, in wood, prefixed
to the "Bulwarke of Defence;" which book is a collection of most of his
works.Stukely, who, in 1722, was at
the expence of having a small head of him engraved.He proves that we
had excellent apples, pears, plums, cherries and hops, of our own
growth, (before the importation of these articles into England), by
London and Kentish gardeners.His zeal for the promotion of the useful
arts of gardening, the general culture of the land, and the commercial
interests of the kingdom, deserved the highest praise; and for the
information he has left of these affairs, in his own time, posterity owe
him acknowledgments."In a note to his Life, in the Biog.folio, 1748, is a curious account of many fruits, &c. then in our
gardens.Richardson's portraits to Granger
gives us the above profile.Johnson, at page 51 of his History of
English Gardening, pointedly says, "Dr.Bulleyn deserves the veneration
of every lover of gardening, for his strenuous advocating its cause, at
a time when it had become a fashion to depreciate the products of our
English gardens."And at page 57, pays him a further just tribute.THOMAS HYLL, who, in 1574, published, in 4to., "The Profitable Arte of
Gardeninge."His interesting chapter on
Bees is annexed to these editions."[61] There appears another edition in
small 12mo.imprinted at London, in Flete-strete, neare to St.Dunstone's Church, by Thomas Marshe, 1658.There are other editions, as
1570 and 1574, 4to.; and 1563 and 1594, 16mo.Bromley thus
mentions a portrait of him:--"Thomas Hill, wooden cut, prefixed to his
Physiognomie; 12mo.A friend to Hyll, in a complimentary
letter, prefixed to the above book, thus, in part, addresses the
reader:--

   _With painfull pen the writer hath exprest in English plane,
   The needfull ayd, and mightie force, that doth in hearbes remaine,
   The time to set, the time to plant, the time to raise again,
   This man by treble diligence hath brought to light with paine._

The portraits of the Lord Chancellor BACON are well known; but in Mr.Montagu's late edition of his works, a new or juvenile portrait is
added, namely, a most expressive, intelligent, and beautiful miniature
of him at his age of eighteen, by Hilyard, of whom Dr.Donne said,

         ----_a hand or eye
   By Hilyard drawn, is worth a history
   By a worse painter._

This fine edition of his works is illustrated by five portraits, taken
at different periods of his lordship's life; by engravings of his
residence, and monument, fac-similes, and other embellishments.In
Mallett's edition are two portraits, one by Vertue, finely
engraved.[62]

GERARDE'S portrait (a fine one) is prefixed to his own edition of his
Herbal.No painter, or engraver's
name, except the initials, W. R. intertwined, which I suppose are those
of W. Rogers, the engraver.There is another good head of Gerarde, a
small oval one, in the title page to Johnson's edition.A portrait, in
oil, of Gerarde, was sold by Mr.Pulteney
reviews both these Herbals.Gerarde is highly extolled by Dr.Bulleyn,
and indeed attained deserved eminence in his day.Pulteney relates
that "the thousand novelties which were brought into England by our
circumnavigators, Raleigh and Cavendish, in 1580 and 1588, excited a
degree of attention, which at this day cannot, without the aid of
considerable recollection, be easily conceived.Raleigh himself appears
to have possessed a larger share of taste for the curious productions of
nature, than was common to the seafaring adventurers of that period.And
posterity will rank these voyagers among the greatest benefactors to
this kingdom, in having been the means, if tradition may be credited, of
introducing the most useful root that Providence has held forth for the
service of man.A voyage round the globe, howsoever familiarized in
ours, was, in that age, a most interesting and fruitful occasion of
enquiry.The return of Raleigh, and the fame of his manifold discoveries
and collections, brought over from the continent the celebrated Clusius,
then in the fifty-fifth year of his age.He, who added more to the stock
of botany, in his day, than all his contemporaries united, visited
England for the third time, to partake, at this critical juncture, in
the general gratification.At this eventful period, Gerarde was in the
vigour of life, and, without doubt, felt the influence, and reaped
the advantage of all the circumstances I have enumerated."One
of the editions of Gerarde thus appears in a bookseller's
catalogue:--"Gerarde's Herball; or Generall Historie of Plants, very
much enlarged by Johnson, folio, _beautiful impression of the
frontispiece by Payne, fine copy, old Russia, gilt back, L3.[63]


WALTER BLYTHE'S whole-length portrait (exhibiting a pensive and
penetrating aspect), is prefixed to his "English Improver Improved;" and
which work Professor Martyn terms "an original and incomparable work for
the time."Beale calls him "honest Captain Blithe."GERVASE MARKHAM'S portrait is prefixed to his "Perfect Horseman;" 8vo.It is re-engraved for Richardson's portraits to Granger.Markham
appears to have been a good soldier, as well as a good scholar.1623, "The Country House-Wife's Garden."He wrote
Herod and Antipater, a tragedy.Langbaine speaks very much in his
praise, and seemingly not without reason.Dibden, in his "Library
Companion," says, "on many accounts does Markham seem entitled to more
notice and commendation."He translated Leibault's Maison Rustique, in
1616, in 4to.or small folio, and augmented it with many additions from
Oliver de Serres, and others.Weston, in his Catalogue, says he
re-printed the editions in 1614 and 1631, of Barnaby Gooche's Husbandry.He published many books on husbandry, on fowling, on angling, on
military discipline, on horsemanship.Many of their titles are
enumerated in Langbaine, and in Weston, and they appear all to be more
fully stated in Watts's Bibl.Much information, as to Markham, may
be seen in vol.of the Censura Literaria; and in Sir E. Brydges's
edition of Phillips's Theatrum Poetarum Anglicanorum, appears, perhaps,
the best list of his works, with a brief memoir.[64]


PARKINSON'S excellent portrait, by Marshall, appears in the title page
to his _Theatrum Botanicum_, in 1640.Some one _may_ now possess the
original.In his _Paradisus_, 1635, there is a very scurvy engraving of
his healthy, and hearty-looking old countenance.In this miserable cut,
which is on wood, the graver, Christopher Switzer, does not seem to have
had a strife "_with nature to outdo the life_."Marshall's head is
re-engraved for Richardson's Illustrations to Granger.Parkinson rose to
such a degree of reputation, as to be appointed Apothecary to King
James.He was appointed herbalist to Charles I. Dr.Pulteney speaks
highly of both the above works, particularly of the _Theatrum_.All the
memorials we have of the private history of this most industrious and
zealous herbalist, are very scanty.He died about 1645, aged about 78.The curious contents of his _Paradisus_ are diffusively narrated in
Johnson's English Gardening.When perusing the pages of either of the
above, one may exclaim,

                           ----"not a tree,
   A plant, a leaf, a blossom, but contains
   A folio volume.We may read, and read,
   And read again; and still find something new,
   Something to please, and something to instruct,
   E'en in the humble weed."[Illustration]

The above is scarcely better than Switzer's.There appears no faithful
portrait of Parkinson, but Marshall's, who _had the felicity_ to draw
other portraits besides his.Hollar's striking portraits of the TRADESCANTS, are well known.On their
tomb, at Lambeth, the following lines form part of the inscription:--

   These famous Antiquarians, that had been
   Both Gardeners to the rose and lily Queen,
   Transplanted now themselves, sleep here; and when
   Angels shall with their trumpets waken men,
   And fire shall purge the world, these hence shall rise,
   And change this Garden for a Paradise.In the Ashmolean Museum, is a portrait of the SON, _in his garden_, with
a spade in his hand.Nichols's "Illustrations to Granger,"
consisting of seventy-five portraits, appear those of the Tradescants,
father and son.Smith also engraved John Tradescant, with his son, and
their monument, 1793.Weston, in his Catalogue, fully describes the
_Museum Tradescantium_.Pulteney observes, that "in a work devoted
to the commemoration of Botanists, their name stands too high not to
demand an honourable notice; since they contributed, at an early period,
by their garden and museum, to raise a curiosity that was eminently
useful to the progress and improvement of natural history in general.The reader may see a curious account of the remains of this garden,
drawn up in the year 1749, by the late Sir W. Watson, and printed in
vol.His widow erected a
curious monument, in memory of the family, in Lambeth church-yard, of
which a large account, and engravings from a drawing of it in the
Pepysian Library, at Cambridge, are given by the late learned Dr.SIR HENRY WOTTON, Provost of Eaton.His portrait is given in Isaac
Walton's Lives of Wotton, and others.It, of course, accompanies
Zouch's, and the other well-known editions of Isaac Walton's Lives.In
Evans's Illustrations to Granger, is Sir H. Wotton, from the picture in
the Bodleian Library, engraved by _Stow_.In Sir Henry's Reflections on
Ancient and Modern Learning, is his chapter "On Ancient and Modern
Agriculture and Gardening."Cowley wrote an elegy on him, which thus
commences:--

   What shall we say since silent now is he,
   Who when he spoke, all things would silent be;
   Who had so many languages in store,
   That only Fame can speak of him with more.Isaac Walton published the "_Reliquiae Wottonianae_, or, Lives, Letters,
Poems, &c. by Sir Henry Wotton," 12mo.1654, with portraits of Wotton,
Charles I., Earl of Essex, and Buckingham.Sir E. Brydges printed at his
private press, at Lee Priory, Sir Henry's Characters of the Earl of
Essex and Buckingham.In the _Reliquiae_, among many curious and
interesting articles, is preserved Sir Henry's delicately complimentary
letter to Milton on receiving from him _Comus_.Sir Henry, when a
resident at Venice, (where he was sent on three several embassies by
James) purchased for that munificent encourager of painting, the Duke of
Buckingham, several valuable pictures, which were added to the Duke's
magnificent collection.Isaac Walton's Life of Wotton thus
concludes:--"Dying worthy of his name and family, worthy of the love of
so many princes, and persons of eminent wisdom and learning, worthy of
the trust committed unto him for the service of his prince and country."And, in his Angler, he thus sweetly paints the warm attachment he had
for Wotton:--"a man with whom I have often fished and conversed, whose
learning, wit, and cheerfulness, made his company to be esteemed one of
the delights of mankind.Peace and patience, and a calm content, did
cohabit in the cheerful heart of Sir Henry Wotton."Dallaway, in his Anecdotes of the Arts, mentions
the following portrait of Sir Thomas:--"At Devonshire-house is a family
groupe, by Dobson, of Sir Thomas Browne.He is smiling with the utmost
complacency upon his children, who surround him."His portrait is also
prefixed to his works.Dict., folio, 1748, says, "his
picture, in the College of Physicians, shews him to have been remarkably
handsome, and to have possessed, in a singular degree, the blessings of
a grave, yet cheerful and inviting, countenance."The same work farther
gives him a most amiable character.Ray, in his Ornithology, does
not omit paying a just compliment to his assistant and friend, "the
deservedly famous Sir Thomas Browne."Evelyn, in 1671, mentions Sir
Thomas Browne's garden at Norwich, as containing a paradise of
varieties, and the gardens of all the inhabitants as full of excellent
flowers.Switzer says, "The noble elegance of his style has since
induced many to read his works, (of which, that of _Cyrus's gardens_ is
some of the brightest,) though they have had little inclination to the
practice of gardening itself.There remains nothing that I have heard of
his putting gardening actually into practice himself; but some of his
last works being observations on several scarce plants mentioned in
Scripture; and of Garlands and Coronary garden plants and flowers, 'tis
reasonable to suppose he did; and the love he had so early and late
discovered toward it, was completed in the delightful practice thereof."He further says, " his elaborate and ingenious pen has not a little
added to the nobleness of our subject."[65] His works were published in
1 vol.folio, 1686, with his portrait, engraved by White.His portrait
appears also to his "Certain Miscellany Tracts," 8vo.A list of his
numerous works may be seen in the Biogr.Dictionaires, or in Watts's
Bibl.It is so masterly written, that it is impossible to give even an
abstract.Kippis has, however, in part, transcribed it.He was
chosen Honorary Fellow of the College of Physicians, as a man _virtute
et literas ornatissimus_.In 1671, he received the honour of Knighthood
from Charles II., a prince, (says Dr.Johnson) "who, with many frailties
and vices, had yet skill to discover excellence, and virtue to reward it
with such honorary distinctions, at least, as cost him nothing, yet,
conferred by a king so judicious and so much beloved, had the power of
giving merit new lustre and greater popularity."Thus he lived in high
reputation, till, in his seventy-sixth year, an illness, which tortured
him a week, put an end to his life, at Norwich, on his birth-day,
October 19, 1682."Some of his last words (we are told by _Whitefoot_)
were expressions of submission to the will of God, and fearlessness of
death."Johnson observes, "It is not on the praises of others, but
on his own writings, that he is to depend for the esteem of posterity;
of which he will not be easily deprived, while learning shall have any
reverence among men: for there is no science in which he does not
discover some skill; and scarce any kind of knowledge, profane or
sacred, abstruse or elegant, which he does not appear to have cultivated
with success.His exuberance of knowledge, and plenitude of ideas,
sometimes obstruct the tendency of his reasoning, and the clearness of
his decisions.On whatever subject he employed his mind, there started
up immediately so many images before him, that he lost one by grasping
another.His memory supplied him with so many illustrations, parallel or
dependent notions, that he was always starting into collateral
considerations.But the spirit and vigour of his pursuit always gives
delight; and the reader follows him, without reluctance, through his
mazes, of themselves flowery and pleasing, and ending at the point
originally in view.There remains yet an objection against the writings
of _Browne_, more formidable than the animadversions of criticism.There
are passages from which some have taken occasion to rank him among
deists, and others among atheists.It would be difficult to guess how
any such conclusion should be formed, had not experience shewn that
there are two sorts of men willing to enlarge the catalogue of infidels.When _Browne_ has been numbered among the contemners of religion by the
fury of its friends, or the artifices of its enemies, it is no difficult
task to replace him among the most zealous professors of christianity.He may perhaps, in the ardour of his imagination, have hazarded an
expression, which a mind intent upon faults may interpret into heresy,
if considered apart from the rest of his discourse; but a phrase is not
to be opposed to volumes.There is scarcely a writer to be found, whose
profession was not divinity, that has so frequently testified his belief
of the sacred writings, has appealed to them with such unlimited
submission, or mentioned them with such unvaried reverence."His portrait by Nanteuil, and that by Kneller, holding
his _Sylva_ in his hand, are well engraved in Mr.The
following remark is from the Quarterly Review, in its review of the same
work, in 1818:--"At four years old he was taught to read by the parish
school-master, whose school was over the church porch; and 'at six his
picture was drawn by one Chanteral, no ill painter.'If this portrait,
as is not unlikely, be preserved in the family, it should have been
engraved for the present work; it would have been very interesting to
compare the countenance of such a person, in childhood, in the flower of
years, when his head was engraved by Nanteuil, and in ripe old age, when
he sat to Sir G.Evelyn, and his family, and he gives a
list of his works.He says "his picture was thrice drawn in oil; first,
in 1641, by one Vanderborcht, brought out of Germany at the same time
with Hollar, the graver, by the Earl of Arundel; a second time in 1648,
by Walker; and the third time by Sir G. Kneller, for his friend Mr.Pepys, of the Admiralty, of which that at the Royal Society is a copy.There is a print of him by Nanteuil, who likewise drew him more than
once in black and white, with Indian ink; and a picture, in crayon, by
Luterel."Evelyn lived in the busy times of Charles I., Cromwell,
Charles II., James II., and William.He had much personal intercourse
with Charles II.and James II., and was in the habits of great intimacy
with many of the ministers of those two monarchs, and of the eminent men
of those days.Foreigners, distinguished for learning or arts, who came
to England, did not leave it without visiting him.His manners we may
presume to have been of the most agreeable kind, for his company was
sought by the greatest men, not merely by inviting him to their own
tables, but by their repeated visits to him at his own house.Evelyn
lived to the great age of eighty-six, and wished these words to be
inscribed on his tomb:--"all is vanity that is not honest, and there is
no solid wisdom but in real piety."[66] Cowley, in a letter to him,
says, "I know nobody that possesses more private happiness than you do
in your garden; and yet no man who makes his happiness more publick, by
a free communication of the art and knowledge of it to others.All that
I myself am able yet to do, is only to recommend to mankind the search
of that felicity, which you instruct them how to find and to enjoy."The
Quarterly Review thus speaks of his _Sylva_:--"The Sylva remained a
beautiful and enduring memorial of his amusements, his occupations, and
his studies, his private happiness, and his public virtues.The greater
part of the woods, which were raised in consequence of Evelyn's
writings, have been cut down; the oaks have borne the British flag to
seas and countries which were undiscovered when they were planted, and
generation after generation has been coffined in the elms.The trees of
his age, which may yet be standing, are verging fast toward their decay
and dissolution: but his name is fresh in the land, and his reputation,
like the trees of an Indian Paradise, exists, and will continue to exist
in full strength and beauty, uninjured by the course of time."of Gardening, thus speaks of him:--"Evelyn is
universally allowed to have been one of the warmest friends to
improvements in gardening and planting, that has ever appeared.He is
eulogized by Wotton, in his _Reflections on Ancient and Modern
Learning_, as having done more than all former ages."Switzer calls him
"that good esquire, the king of gardeners."Walpole)
"was a course of inquiry, study, curiosity, instruction, and
benevolence.He knew that retirement, in his own hands, was industry and
benefit to mankind; in those of others, laziness and inutility."There appears the following more modern publications respecting Mr.Sylva, with Notes by Hunter; in 4to, and 8vo.Another edition, in 2
vols., 4to.Evelyn's Miscellaneous Writings, collected and edited, with Notes, by
Mr.Forming a Supplement to the Evelyn Memoirs.of Gardening enumerates the whole of Mr.Johnson in his History of
English Gardening.[67]

ABRAHAM COWLEY.That in Bishop
Hurd's edition is very neat.This same portrait is also well engraved
for Ankars's edition of Cowley; and also in that by Aikens, in 8vo.Dean
Sprat has prefixed to his edition of Cowley, his portrait, engraved by
Faithorne, and, in his preface, pays a warm and just tribute to his
memory.When his death was announced to Charles II., he declared, that
Mr.Cowley had not left a better man behind him in England.Cowley
addresses his chapter _Of Gardens_ (which strongly paints his delight in
them) to Mr.He wrote this epitaph for himself:--

   From life's superfluous cares enlarg'd,
   His debt of human toil discharg'd,
   Here COWLEY lies, beneath this shed,
   To ev'ry worldly interest _dead_:
   With decent poverty content;
   His hours of ease not idly spent;
   To fortune's goods a foe profess'd,
   And, hating wealth, by all caress'd.'Tis sure he's _dead_; for, lo!how small
   A spot of earth is now his all!wish that earth may lightly lay,
   And ev'ry care be far away!Bring flow'rs, the short-liv'd roses bring,
   To _life deceased_ fit offering!And sweets around the poet strow,
   Whilst yet with life his ashes glow.JOHN ROSE, head gardener to the Lord Essex, at Essex-house, in the
Strand.He sent him to study the celebrated beauties in the gardens of
Versailles.He became afterwards the chief gardener to Charles II., at
the royal gardens in St.His portrait may be seen at
Kensington, in an oil painting, where he is presenting a pine to his
Majesty, whilst on a visit to the Duchess of Cleveland, at Downey Court,
Buckinghamshire.It has lately been engraved in mezzotinto.He was the
author of "The English Vineyard Vindicated, and the Way of Making Wine
in France;" first printed with Evelyn's French Gardener, in 1672, 12mo.Other editions in 1675, 1676, and 1690, in 8vo.The preface is by
Evelyn, as well as The Art of Making Wine.Rose brought to great
perfection dwarf fruit trees, in the gardens at Hampton Court, Carlton,
and Marlborough House.Switzer thus speaks of him:--"He was esteemed to
be the best of his profession in those days, and ought to be remembered
for the encouragement he gave to a servant of his, that has since made
the greatest figure that ever yet any gardener did, I mean Mr.Rose may be well ranked amongst the greatest virtuosos of that time,
(now dead) who were all well pleased to accept of his company while
living."He published "The Planter's Manual," 12mo.There
is prefixed to it a rural frontispiece, by Van Houe.Johnson
properly calls him "one of the _Scriptores minores_ of horticulture."His "devoted attachment to Izaak Walton, forms the best evidence we have
of his naturally amiable disposition."Major's extensively illustrated and most attractive editions of
the Angler; a delightful book, exhibiting a "matchless picture of rural
nature."Cotton's portrait is also well engraved in Zouch's Life of
Walton; and in the many other curious and embellished editions of Walton
and Cotton's Angler.He translated with such truth and spirit, the
celebrated Essays of Montaigne, that he received from that superior
critic, the Marquis of Halifax, a most elegant encomium.Sir John
Hawkins calls it "one of the most valuable books in the English
language."Cotton's works appears in Watts's
Bibl.When describing, in his _Wonders of the Peake_, the Queen
of Scot's Pillar, he thus breaks out:--

   Illustrious _Mary_, it had happy been,
   Had you then found a cave like this to skreen
   Your sacred person from those frontier spies,
   That of a sovereign princess durst make prize,
   When Neptune too officiously bore
   Your cred'lous innocence to this faithless shore.once who hadst the only fame
   Of being kind to all who hither came
   For refuge and protection, how couldst thou
   So strangely alter thy good nature now,
   Where there was so much excellence to move,
   Not only thy compassion, but thy love?'Twas strange on earth, save _Caledonian_ ground,
   So impudent a villain could be found,
   Such majesty and sweetness to accuse;
   Or, after that, a judge would not refuse
   Her sentence to pronounce; or that being done,
   Even amongst bloody'st hangmen, to find one
   Durst, though her face was veil'd, and neck laid down,
   Strike off the fairest head e'er wore a crown.And what state policy there might be here,
   Which does with right too often interfere,
   I'm not to judge: yet thus far dare be bold,
   A fouler act the sun did ne'er behold.[68]

Plott, in his Staffordshire, calls Mr.Cotton "his worthy, learned, and
most ingenious friend."Sir John Hawkins thus speaks of him:--"He was
both a wit and a scholar; of an open, cheerful, and hospitable temper;
endowed with fine talents for conversation, and the courtesy and
affability of a gentleman."He farther thus speaks of one of his
poems:--"It is not for their courtly and elegant turn, that the verses
of Charles Cotton ought to be praised; there is such a delightful flow
of feeling and sentiment, so much of the best part of our nature mixed
up in them, and so much fancy displayed, that one of our most
distinguished living poets has adduced several passages of his Ode upon
Winter, for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy."He
must have possessed many endearing qualities, for the benevolent and
pious Walton thus concludes a letter to his "most honoured friend,
Charles Cotton, Esq.:"--"though I be more than a hundred miles from you,
and in the eighty-third year of my age, yet I will forget both, and next
month begin a pilgrimage to beg your pardon: for I would die in your
favour, and till then will live, Sir, your most affectionate father and
friend, Isaac Walton."One cannot wonder at the good old man wishing to
visit the courteous and well-bred Mr.Cotton, and to enjoy the
intercourse of hospitable urbanity, near the pastoral streams of the
Dove, when he had received such an invitation as the following,
addressed to his "dear and most worthy friend, Mr.Isaac Walton:"--

   Whilst in this cold and blustering clime,
     Where bleak winds howl and tempests roar,
   We pass away the roughest time
     Has been of many years before;

   Whilst from the most tempestuous nooks
     The chillest blasts our peace invade,
   And by great rains our smallest brooks
     Are almost navigable made;

   Whilst all the ills are so improved,
     Of this dead quarter of the year,
   That even you, so much beloved,
     We would not now wish with us here;

   In this estate, I say, it is
     Some comfort to us to suppose,
   That, in a better clime than this,
     You, our dear friend, have more repose;

   And some delight to me the while,
     Though nature now does weep in rain,
   To think that I have seen her smile,
     And haply may I do again.If the all-ruling Power please
     We live to see another May,
   We'll recompense an age of these
     Foul days in one fine fishing day.We then shall have a day or two,
     Perhaps a week, wherein to try
   What the best master's hand can do
     With the most deadly killing fly:

   A day with not too bright a beam,
     A warm, but not a scorching sun,
   A southern gale to curl the stream,
     and, master, half our work is done.There, whilst behind some bush we wait
     The scaly people to betray,--
   We'll prove it just, with treacherous bait
     To make the preying _Trout_ our prey.And think ourselves, in such an hour,
     Happier than those, though not so high,
   Who, like _Leviathans_, devour
     Of meaner men the smaller fry.This, my best friend, at my poor home
     Shall be our pastime and our theme;
   But then--should you not deign to come,
     You make all this a flattering dream.In wandering over the lovely scenes, the pleasant brooks, the
flower-bespangled meadows, which the moral pages of Isaac Walton so
unaffectedly delineate, it is impossible not to recur to the name of the
late author of _Salmonia_, and to reflect, that on these pages he oft
unbended his vigorous mind from his severe and brilliant discoveries.We
can now only lament the (almost) premature death of this high-ranked
philosopher, this great benefactor to the arts, and deep promoter of
science, whose mortal remains were consigned to his unostentatious tomb,
at Geneva, in one of the finest evenings of summer, followed by the
eloquent and amiable historian, De Sismondi, and by other learned and
illustrious men.One may apply to his last moments at Geneva, (where he
had arrived only one day before) these lines of his own favourite
Herbert:--

   _Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,
     The bridal of the earth and sky,
   Sweet dews shall weep thy fall to-night,
     For thou must die!_[69]


SAMUEL GILBERT'S portrait is prefixed to his "Florist's Vade Mecum;"
12mo.In his "Gardener's Almanack," is a particular description of the
roses cultivated in the English gardens at that period.He was the
author of "Fons Sanitatis, or the Healing Spring at Willowbridge Wells."He was son-in-law to John Rea, the author of Flora, and who planned the
gardens at Gerard's Bromley.Willowbridge Wells are at a little distance
from where these once superb gardens were.JACOB BOBART, the elder, is an admirable portrait, by D. Loggan, taken
at his age of eighty-one, and engraved by Burghers.Beneath the head, which is dated 1675, is this
distich:--

   _Thou Germane prince of plants, each year to thee,
   Thousands of subjects grant a subsidy._

It is a venerable countenance, of deep thought.Richardson re-engraved
this among his Illustrations to Granger.Granger mentions also a
whole-length of Bobart in a garden, dog, goat, &c.of
Gardening says, "Bobart's descendants are still in Oxford, and known as
coach proprietors."The
munificence of the Earl of Danby placed Bobart in the physic garden at
Oxford, in 1632, as supervisor; and this garden flourished many years
under his care, and that of his son Jacob, whose zeal and diligence Dr.The elder Bobart was the author of the _Hortus
Oxoniensis_, 1648.Wood, in his Athenae, informs us, that "Jacob Bobart
died in his garden-house, in February, 1679, whereupon his body was
buried in the church of St.He left two sons, _Jacob_ and
_Tillemant_.Tillemant became a master coachman between Oxford and
London, but having had the misfortune to break his leg, became one of
the beadles of the university.Nicholls's late
curious work on autographs, among other _albums_, in the British Museum,
it mentions that of David Krein, in which is the autograph of Jacob
Bobart, with these verses;--

             ----"virtus sua gloria.Think that day lost whose descending sun
   Views from thy hand no noble action done.Yr success and happyness
               is sincerely wished by
                     Ja.It appears from Ray's History of Plants, that Jacob Bobart, the son, was
a frequent communicator to him of scarce plants.It was this son who
published the second volume of Morrison's Oxford History of Plants, who
wrote its excellent preface, and who engaged _Burghers_ to engrave many
of the new plants; which engravings are highly commended by Pulteney.Johnson, in page 148 of his History of Gardening, thus pays Bobart a
high compliment:--"a phalanx of botanists were then contemporaries,
which previous ages never equalled, nor succeeding ones surpassed.Ray,
Tournefort, Plumier, Plukenet, Commelin, Rivinus, _Bobart_, Petiver,
Sherard, Boccone, Linnaeus, may be said to have lived in the same age."His portrait is engraved by Vertue, from after Verelst,
and prefixed to his translation of _Rapin on Gardens_, 8vo.I believe he also wrote
"On the Beatitudes;" 2 vols.Switzer says, that this "incomparable
Latin poem was translated by an ingenious and worthily dignified
clergyman, and a great lover of gardening, Mr.Gardiner, Sub-Dean of
Lincoln."He became afterwards (I believe) Bishop of Lincoln; and a
Latin epitaph on this bishop is in Peck's _Desid.Curiosa._ There is a
print of "Jacobus Gardiner, Episc.Lincoln," engraved by George White,
from after Dahl.Vanderbane's engraving, from Sir Peter Lely's, is particularly fine.Vertue's engravings, from Sir Peter, in the folio editions of 1720 and
1740, are also fine.This same portrait is neatly engraved in the late
Mr.Houbraken has also engraved the same
for Birch's Lives.Sir William Temple, after spending twenty years in
negociations with foreign powers, retired in 1680 from public life, and
employed his time in literary pursuits.He was ambassador for many years
at the court of Holland, and there acquired his knowledge and taste in
gardening.He had a garden at Sheen, and afterwards, another at Moor
Park, where he died in 1700; and though his body was buried in
Westminster Abbey, his heart was enclosed in a silver urn under a
sun-dial in the latter garden.His Essay "Upon the Gardens of Epicurus,
or of Gardening in the year 1685," is printed in all the editions of his
works.[70] These works are published in 2 vols.Switzer, in his History of Gardening, first published in 1715, says,
"That he was a great lover of gardening, appears by his own writings,
and several kinds of fruit brought over by him out of Holland, &c. as
well as by the testimony of his neighbours _yet living_, the greatest
consolation of his life being, in the lucid intervals he had from public
employs, in his beloved gardens at _Sheen_."And, in his Fruit Gardener
he says, that "the magnificence and generosity of this great lover of
planting, distributed vast numbers of the finest grapes among the
nurserymen about London, as well as amongst the nobility and gentry."Lord Mountmorris thus speaks of him:--"The retirement of this great man
has bequeathed the most invaluable legacy to posterity.Of the taste and
elegance of his writings too much can never be said, illuminated as they
are by that probity and candour which pervade them, and those charms
which render truth irresistible.Though other writers may be more the
objects of imitation to the scholar, yet his style is certainly the best
adapted to the politician and the man of fashion; nor would such an
opinion be given, were it not for an anecdote of Swift, which I had from
the late Mr.Sheridan, who told me the dean always recommended him as
the best model, and had repeatedly said that the style of Sir William
Temple was the easiest, the most liberal, and the most brilliant
in our language.In a word, when we consider his probity, his
disinterestedness, his contempt of wealth, the genuine beauty of his
style, which was as brilliant, as harmonious, and as pure as his life
and manners; when we reflect upon the treasures which he has bequeathed
by his example and by his works to his country, which no man ever loved
better, or esteemed more; we cannot avoid considering Sir William Temple
as one of the greatest characters which has appeared upon the political
stage; and he may be justly classed with the greatest names of
antiquity, and with the most brilliant characters which adorn and
illustrate the Grecian or Roman annals."Mason, in his English
Garden, contrasts Sir William's idea of "a perfect garden," with those
of Lord Bacon, and Milton; but he candidly says,

                        ----and yet full oft
   O'er Temple's studious hour did truth preside,
   Sprinkling her lustre o'er his classic page;
   There hear his candour own, in fashion's spite,
   In spite of courtly dulness hear it own,
   _There is a grace in wild variety
   Surpassing rule and order._ Temple, yes,
   There is a grace; and let eternal wreaths
   Adorn their brows who fixt its empire here."He then, in glowing lines, pays an animated tribute to Addison, Pope,
and Kent.Hume records that "he was full of honour and humanity."Sir
William thus concludes one of his philosophic essays:--"When this is
done, human life is, at the greatest and the best, but like a froward
child, that must be played with and humoured a little to keep it quiet
till it falls asleep, and then the care is over."His garden was one of
his last delights.He knew what kind of life was best fitted to make a
man's last days happy.Walpole, though he censures Sir William's
warm panegyric on the garden at Moor Park, yet scruples not doing him
full justice, in styling him an excellent man, and an admired writer,
whose style, as to his garden, is animated with the colouring and glow
of poetry.Cobbett, in his _English Gardener_, thus deplores the
fate of Moor Park:--"This really wise and excellent man, Sir W. Temple,
who, while he possessed the soundest judgment, and was employed in some
of the greatest concerns of his country, so ardently, yet so rationally
and unaffectedly, praises the pursuits of gardening, in which he
delighted from his youth to his old age; and of his taste in which, he
gave such delightful proofs in those gardens and grounds at Moor Park,
beneath the turf of one spot of which, he caused by his will, his heart
to be buried, and which spot, together with all the rest of the
beautiful arrangement, has been torn about and disfigured within the
last fifty years, by a succession of wine merchants, spirit merchants,
West Indians, and God knows what besides."And, in his _Woodlands_, he
says, "I have stood for hours, when a little boy, looking at this object
(the canal and borders of beautiful flowers at Moor Park); I have
travelled far since, and have seen a great deal; but I have never seen
any thing of the gardening kind so beautiful in the whole course of my
life."Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, after noticing
many general particulars of Sir William, devotes an interesting page to
Sir William's attachment to gardening; and every line in this generous
page, betrays his own delight in this art.He thus concludes this
page:--"Nothing can demonstrate more fully the delight he took in
gardening, than the direction left in his will, that his heart should be
buried beneath the sun-dial of his garden, at Moor Park, near Farnham,
in Surrey.In accordance with which, it was deposited there in a silver
box, affording another instance of the ruling passion unweakened even in
death.Nor was this an unphilosophical clinging to that which it was
impossible to retain; but rather that grateful feeling, common to our
nature, of desiring finally to repose where in life we have been happy.In his garden, Sir William Temple had spent the calmest hours of a
well-spent life, and where his heart had been most peaceful, he wished
its dust to mingle, and thus, at the same time, offering his last
testimony to the sentiment, that in a garden

   _Hic secura quies, et nescia fallere vita._"

JOHN LOCKE wrote "Observations upon the Growth of Vines and Olives; the
Production of Silk, the Preservation of Fruits.Written at the request
of the Earl of Shaftesbury; now first printed from the original
manuscript in the possession of the present Earl of Shaftesbury, 1s.Among the many portraits we have of this learned man, the
public are indebted to Lord King, for having prefixed to his Life of Mr.Locke, a very fine portrait of him, from after Greenhill.This great and
good man possessed, in the highest degree, those virtues that have
given him a claim to the highest rank in the admiration of posterity.In
Rutter's delineations of a part of Somersetshire, he gives a neat
wood-cut of the cottage at Wrington, wherein Locke was born, and he
informs us, that in the garden belonging to Mrs.Hannah More, near that
village, she has placed an urn commemorative of Locke, which was a gift
to her from the justly celebrated Mrs.He was drawn also by
Kneller.Bromley gives a list of many of his engraved portraits.Houbraken engraved one for Birch's Lives.Vertue gave two engravings
from Kneller.WILLIAM FLEETWOOD, successively Bishop of St.Asaph and Ely, and who
died in 1723, was author of "Curiosities of Nature and Art in Husbandry
and Gardening," 8vo.His portrait is prefixed to his "Sermons on
the Relative Duties," 8vo.1716; and also to his "Essay on the
Miracles."His works were published in a collected form in 1 vol.He was incontestibly the best preacher in his time.Doddridge
calls him "silver tongued."Pope's line of

   _The gracious dew of pulpit eloquence_,

might, no doubt, have been justly applied to him.Drake, in the
third volume of his Essays, to illustrate the Tatler, Spectator, and
Guardian, has some interesting pages respecting him.His benevolent
heart and exemplary life, added great effect to his persuasive eloquence
in the pulpit."His sermons (says Lempriere), and divinity tracts, were
widely circulated; but the firmness of his opinions drew upon him the
censure of the House of Commons.His preface to his sermons on the
deaths of Mary, the Duke of Gloucester, and of William, and on the
accession of Anne, gave such offence to the ministry, that the book was
publicly burnt in 1712; but it was more universally read, and even
appeared in the Spectator, No.Johnson
remarked, that fire is a conclusive, but not a convincing argument; it
will certainly destroy any book, but it refutes none.[71] In an
_Obituary_, preserved in Peck's Desid.Curiosa, it thus mentions the
death of a Jeffery Fleetwood, "leaving a wife and six little children
behind him.One of these little children was the famous
William Fleetwood, Bishop of Ely."JOSEPH ADDISON, Esq.There is an original portrait of this eminent man,
at Holland House.Noble's continuation of Granger
enumerates several engravings of him, from Kneller's portraits.Dayl,
the painter, also drew him.In
Ireland's "Picturesque Views on the River Avon," he gives an interesting
description of Mr.Addison's house at Bilton, near Rugby, two miles from
Dunchurch; with a view of the same.The house "remains precisely in the
state it was at the decease of its former possessor, nor has the
interior suffered much change in its former decoration.The furniture
and pictures hold their places with an apparent sacred attention to his
memory.Among the latter, are three of himself, at different periods of
his life; in each of which is strongly marked with the pencil, the ease
of the gentleman, and the open and ingenuous character of the friend to
humanity."Drake's Biographical Sketch of Addison, it appears,
that these portraits were still remaining in his house in 1797.A copy
of the above view is given in the Monthly Magazine for February, 1822,
and it there says, that "the spacious gardens retain the fashion of the
age of the Spectator."The origin of the modern style of landscape
gardening, or the first writers on that subject, were unquestionably Mr.414 and 477 of the _Spectator_, and Mr.Pope in his
celebrated _Guardian_.The first artists who practised in this style,
were Bridgman and Kent.Addison's pure taste on these subjects
is visible even where he prefers Fontainebleau to the magnificent
Versailles, in his paper in the _Guardian_, No.101:--"It is situated
among rocks and woods, that give you a fine variety of savage prospects.The king has humoured the genius of the place, and only made use of so
much art as is necessary to help and regulate nature, without reforming
her too much.The cascades seem to break through the clefts and cracks
of rocks that are covered over with moss, and look as if they were piled
upon one another by accident.There is an artificial wildness in the
meadows, walks, and canals; and the garden, instead of a wall, is fenced
on the lower end by a natural mound of rock-work that strikes the eye
very agreeably.For my part, I think there is something more charming in
these rude heaps of stone than in so many statues, and would as soon see
a river winding through woods and meadows, as when it is tossed up in so
many whimsical figures at Versailles."414 of his Spectator, he
says, "English gardens are not so entertaining to the fancy as those in
France, and Italy, where we see a large extent of ground covered over
with an agreeable mixture of garden, and forest, which represent every
where an artificial rudeness, much more charming than that neatness and
elegancy which we meet with in those of our own country."Murphy
thus compares Addison with Johnson:--"Addison lends grace and ornament
to truth; Johnson gives it force and energy.Addison makes virtue
amiable; Johnson represents it as an awful duty."Addison has been
called the English Fenelon.Johnson calls him the Raphael of essay
writers.The imposing and commanding attitude of the statue erected a
few years since in the Poets' Corner, seems to have arisen, and to have
been devoted to his memory, from his _Reflections on the Tombs in the
Abbey_.Those reflections I here subjoin; and I am sure my reader will
agree with me, that I could not offer a purer honour to his genius and
memory:--"No.26, Friday, March 30._Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas
     Regumque turres, O beate sexti.Vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchoare longam,
     Jam te premet nox, fabulaeque manes,
   Et domus exilis Plutonia._--HOR.With equal foot, rich friend, impartial fate
   Knocks at the cottage, and the palace gate:
   Life's span forbids thee to extend thy cares,
   And stretch thy hopes beyond thy tender years:
   Night soon will seize, and you must quickly go
   To storied ghosts, and _Pluto's_ house below.--CREECH."When I am in a serious humour, I very often walk by myself in
Westminster Abbey; where the gloominess of the place, and the use to
which it is applied, with the solemnity of the building, and the
condition of the people who lie in it, are apt to fill the mind with a
kind of melancholy, or rather thoughtfulness, that is not disagreeable.I yesterday passed a whole afternoon in the church-yard, the cloisters,
and the church, amusing myself with the tomb-stones and inscriptions
that I met with in those several regions of the dead.Most of them
recorded nothing else of the buried person, but that he was born upon
one day and died upon another: the whole history of his life being
comprehended in those two circumstances, that are common to all mankind.I could not but look upon these registers of existence, whether of brass
or marble, as a kind of satire upon the departed persons; who had left
no other memorial of them, but that they were born and that they died.They put me in mind of several persons mentioned in the battles of
heroic poems, who have sounding names given them, for no other reason
but that they may be killed, and are celebrated for nothing but being
knocked on the head._Glaucumque, Medontaque, Thersilochumque._--VIRG."The life of these men is finely described in holy writ by _the path of
an arrow_, which is immediately closed up and lost.Upon my going into
the church, I entertained myself with the digging of a grave; and saw in
every shovel-full of it that was thrown up, the fragment of a bone or
skull intermixed with a kind of fresh mouldering earth that some time or
other had a place in the composition of an human body.Upon this I began
to consider with myself what innumerable multitudes of people lay
confused together under the pavement of that ancient cathedral; how men
and women, friends and enemies, priests and soldiers, monks and
prebendaries, were crumbled amongst one another, and blended together in
the same common mass; how beauty, strength, and youth, with old age,
weakness, and deformity, lay undistinguished in the same promiscuous
heap of matter.After having thus surveyed this great magazine of
mortality, as it were in the lump; I examined it more particularly by
the accounts which I found on several of the monuments which are raised
in every quarter of that ancient fabrick.Some of them were covered with
such extravagant epitaphs, that if it were possible for the dead person
to be acquainted with them, he would blush at the praises which his
friends have bestowed upon him.There are others so excessively modest,
that they deliver the character of the person departed in _Greek_ or
_Hebrew_, and by that means are not understood once in a twelvemonth.In
the poetical quarter, I found there were poets who had no monuments, and
monuments which had no poets.I observed indeed that the present war had
filled the church with many of these uninhabited monuments, which had
been erected to the memory of persons whose bodies were buried in the
plains of _Blenheim_, or in the bosom of the ocean.I could not but be
very much delighted with several modern epitaphs, which are written with
great elegance of expression and justness of thought, and therefore do
honour to the living as well as to the dead.As a foreigner is very apt
to conceive an idea of the ignorance or politeness of a nation from the
turn of their public monuments and inscriptions, they should be
submitted to the perusal of men of learning and genius before they are
put in execution.Sir_Cloudesly Shovel's_ monument has very often given
me great offence: instead of the brave rough _English_ admiral, which
was the distinguishing character of that plain gallant man, he is
represented on his tomb by the figure of a beau, dressed in a long
periwig, and reposing himself upon velvet cushions under a canopy of
state.The inscription is answerable to the monument; for, instead of
celebrating the many remarkable actions he had performed in the service
of his country, it acquaints us only with the manner of his death, in
which it was impossible for him to reap any honour.The _Dutch_, whom we
are apt to despise for want of genius, shew an infinitely greater taste
of antiquity and politeness in their buildings and works of this nature,
than what we meet with in those of our own country.The monuments of
their admirals, which have been erected at the public expense, represent
them like themselves; and are adorned with rostral crowns and naval
ornaments, with beautiful festoons of sea-weed, shells, and coral.I have left the repository of our English
kings for the contemplation of another day, when I shall find my mind
disposed for so serious an amusement.I know that entertainments of this
nature are apt to raise dark and dismal thoughts in timorous minds, and
gloomy imaginations; but, for my own part, though I am always serious,
I do not know what it is to be melancholy; and can therefore take a view
of nature in her deep and solemn scenes, with the same pleasure as in
her most gay and delightful ones.By this means I can improve myself
with those objects which others consider with terror.When I look upon
the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy dies in me; when I read
the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I
meet with the grief of parents upon a tomb-stone, my heart melts with
compassion; when I see the tomb of the parents themselves, I consider
the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow: When I see
kings lying by those who deposed them, when I consider rival wits placed
side by side, or the holy men that divided the world with their contests
and disputes, I reflect with sorrow and astonishment on the little
competitions, factions, and debates of mankind.When I read the several
dates of the tombs, of some that died yesterday, and some six hundred
years ago, I consider that great day when we shall all of us be
contemporaries, and make our appearance together.JOHN LAWRENCE published "The Clergyman's Recreation, shewing the
Pleasure and Profit of the Art of Gardening;" 8vo.Also a poem,
called "Paradise Regained, or the Art of Gardening;" 8vo.The
sixth edition of "The Clergyman's Recreation" has "the effigies of the
author, engraved by Vertue."I have seen eight copies of this sixth
edition, and in neither of them has this portrait been.No doubt the
collecting to form Granger's, has deprived each copy of its portrait.This is an expressive portrait, ornamented with a vine wreath, and with
a rich cornucopia or clusters of ripe fruit.The original picture from
which Vertue's print was taken, was at Pallion, near Durham, the seat of
his grandson, John Goodchild, Esq.In Rodd's catalogue of engraved
portraits, printed a few years ago, was "John Lawrence, prebend of
Salisbury, _original drawing by Vertue_, price 5s."Lawrence
published also, in folio, in 1726, his System of Agriculture and
Gardening.of his Literary Anecdotes, has given
a list of all his works, has preserved a few particulars respecting him,
and pays a just tribute to him.A list of his works may also be seen in
Watts's Bibl.of Gardening
informs us that he was "of a hospitable and benevolent disposition,
taking great pleasure in presenting a rich dessert of fruit to his
friends."He was presented to the rectory of Yelvertoft,
Northamptonshire, in 1703, "by the extraordinary uncommon bounty of a
generous patron."In 1721, he was presented to that of Bishop's
Wearmouth, Durham, where he died in 1732.He was also a prebend of
Salisbury.Lawrence thus enforces the pleasures of a garden, to his own
order:--"to make them happy by loving an innocent diversion, the
amusements of a garden being not only most delightful to those that love
them, but most wholesome to those that use them.A good man knows how to
recapitulate all his pleasures in a devout lifting up of his hands, his
eyes and his heart, to the great and bountiful author of nature, who
gives beauty, relish, and success to all our honest labours."His pen
likewise paints with "soft and tempting colours," the extreme beauty of
our fruit-trees, when clothed with their different coloured blossoms,
(what Lord Byron calls _the sweet and blooming fruits of
earth_):--"What a pleasing entertainment is it to the eye, to behold
the apricot in its full blossom, white as snow, and at the same time the
peach with its crimson-coloured blooms; both beginning to be
interspersed with green leaves!These are succeeded by the pear, the
cherry, and the plum, whose blossoms and leaves make a very beautiful
mixture in the spring; and it cannot be a less pleasant sight to see
clusters of swelling fruit all the summer, as the earnest of the full
gratification of another sense in autumn.And now we have come hither,
what painter can draw a landskip more charming and beautiful to the eye,
than an old Newington peach-tree laden with fruit in August, when the
sun has first begun to paint one side of the fruit with such soft and
tempting colours?The apricot, the pear, the cherry and plum, when they
appear in plenty as they ought, present themselves to the eye at the
time of ripening in very inviting blushes.In short, all the several
sorts of fruit trees have such pleasing varieties, that were there no
other sense to be gratified but the sight, they may vie with a parterre
even of the finest flowers."He thus mentions the month of _July_:--"How
beautiful and refreshing are the mornings and evenings of such days,
when the very air is perfumed with pleasant odours, and every thing that
presents itself to the eye gives fresh occasion to the devout admirer to
praise and adore the Great Creator, who hath given such wisdom and power
to man to diversify nature in such various instances, and (for his own
use, pleasure, and profit,) to assist her in all her operations."This
worthy clergyman might have applied to the delights of a garden, the
sacred words of scripture:--"her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all
her paths are peace."[75]

ALEXANDER POPE.Numerous are the engraved portraits of this graceful and
harmonious poet.Noble's continuation of Granger, gives all, or the
greater part of the engravings from his portraits, from which it will be
seen, that he was drawn by Kneller, by Richardson, by many others, and
particularly by his friend Jervas.Pope's attachment to him, however, has enshrined
his name in glowing lines to future generations.The portraits of Pope
which Jervas drew, were done _con amore_.Jennings, of Cheapside,
has prefixed to his elegant folio edition of the "Essay on Man," a
_whole-length_ of Mr.In Dodsley's Collection
of Poems, vol.Pope, as an
accompaniment to Mr.Dodsley's affecting poem to his memory, which he
entitles _The Cave of Pope_.Surely this bust must have strongly
resembled Pope, or Mr.The profile
to Ruffhead's Life, in 4to.1769, _must_ have been a likeness, or Bishop
Warburton would not have permitted its insertion.His age was then
twenty-four.It is finely engraved by Ravenet, from Kneller.A copy of this is admirably engraved in Bell's Poets,
richly ornamented.A copy from that by Richardson is prefixed to
Warton's edition.Among the portraits at _Hagley_, is that of Pope, and
his dog Bounce, by Richardson.[76] Lord Chesterfield thus speaks of
Pope:--"His poor, crazy, deformed body, was a mere Pandora's box,
containing all the physical ills that ever afflicted humanity.This,
perhaps, whetted the edge of his satire, and may, in some degree, excuse
it.I will say nothing of his works; they speak sufficiently for
themselves; they will live as long as taste and letters shall remain in
this country, and be more and more admired, as envy and resentment shall
subside.But I will venture this piece of classical blasphemy: which is,
that however he may be supposed to be obliged to Horace, Horace is more
obliged to him."Ruffhead (generally supposed to have had his
information from Dr.Warburton) thus states:--"Mr.Pope was low in
stature, and of a diminutive and misshapen figure, which no one
ridiculed more pleasantly than himself.His constitution was naturally
tender and delicate, and in his temper he was naturally mild and
gentle, yet sometimes betrayed that exquisite sensibility which is the
concomitant of genius.His lively perception and delicate feeling,
irritated by wretched ill health, made him too quickly take fire, but
his good sense and humanity soon rendered him placable.With regard to
the extent of his genius, it was so wide and various, that perhaps it
may not be too much to say, that he excelled in every species of
composition; and, beside his excellence as a poet, he was both an
antiquarian and an architect, and neither in an inferior degree.[77] No
man ever entertained more exalted notions of friendship, or was ever
more sincere, steady, warm, and disinterested, in all his attachments.Every inch of his heart was let out in lodgings for his friends."Lord
Orrery thus speaks of him:--"His prose writings are little less
harmonious than his verse; and his voice, in common conversation, was so
naturally musical, that I remember honest Tom Southern used to call him
the Little Nightingale; his manners were delicate, easy, and engaging;
he treated his friends with a politeness that charmed, and a generosity
that was much to his honour.Every guest was made happy within his
doors; pleasure dwelt under his roof, and elegance presided at his
table."I
will merely select one or two instances.In a letter to _Swift_, he
says, "My house is too large; my gardens furnish too much wood and
provision for _my_ use.They
have intermarried, and are become rather low friends than servants.Would to God you would come over with Lord Orrery, whose care of you in
the voyage I could so certainly depend on; and bring with you your old
housekeeper, and two or three servants.I have room for all, a heart for
all, and (think what you will) a fortune for all."In another letter to
Swift, he says, "I wish you had any motive to see this kingdom.I could
keep you; for I am rich, that is, I have more than I want.I can afford
room for yourself and two servants.I have, indeed, room enough, nothing
but myself at home: the kind and hearty housewife is dead!the agreeable
and instructive neighbour is gone!yet my house is enlarged, and the
gardens extend and flourish, as knowing nothing of the guests they have
lost.I have more fruit trees and kitchen garden than you have any
thought of; nay, I have good melons and pineapples of my own growth."Allen_, he says, "Let me know your day for coming, and
I will have every room in my house as warm for you as the owner always
would be."Mathias, in his Pursuits of Literature, (besides
expatiating with fond delight, in numerous pages, on the genius of
Pope,) thus speaks of him:--"Familiar with the great, intimate with the
polite, graced by the attentions of the fair, admired by the learned, a
favourite with the nation, independent in an acquired opulence, the
honourable product of his genius, and of his industry; the companion of
persons distinguished for their virtue, birth, high fashion, rank, or
wit, and resident in the centre of all public information and
intelligence; every avenue to knowledge, and every mode of observation
were open to his curious, prying, piercing, and unwearied
intellect."[78]

One may with truth further apply to Mr.Pope what was said of Buchanan,
that his mind was stored with all the fire, and all the graces of
ancient literature.Pope's attachment to _gardens_, appears not only
in his letter to Martha Blount, describing Sir W. Raleigh's seat--but in
his own garden at Twickenham, (where, as Mr.Loudon feelingly observes,
_only the soil of which now remains_)--and in his letter to Mr.Blount,
describing his grotto--but it also bursts forth in many passages
throughout his works--and in his celebrated _Guardian_ (No.173), which
attacks, with the keenest wit, "our study to recede from nature," in our
giants made out of yews, and lavender pigs with sage growing in their
bellies.His epistle to Lord Burlington confirms the charms he felt in
studying nature.Mason, in a note to his English Garden, says, "I
had before called Bacon the prophet, and Milton, the herald of true
taste in gardening.The former, because, in developing the constituent
properties of a princely garden, he had largely expatiated upon that
adorned natural wildness which we now deem the essence of the art.The
latter, on account of his having made this natural wildness the leading
idea in his exquisite description of Paradise.I here call Addison,
_Pope_, Kent, &c. the champions of this true taste."Mason has
added an _&c._, may we not add to these respected names, that of honest
old Bridgman?It was the determination of Lord Byron (had his life been
longer spared), to have erected, at his own expence, a monument to
Pope.[79] We can gather even from his rapid and hurried "Letter on the
Rev.W. L. Bowles's Strictures," his attachment to the high name of
Pope:--"If Lucretius had not been spoiled by the Epicurean system, we
should have had a far superior poem to any now in existence.As mere
poetry, it is the first of Latin poems.Pope has not this defect; his moral is as pure as his poetry is
glorious."--"Pope's charities were his own, and they were noble and
extensive, far beyond his fortune's warrant."--"I have loved and
honoured the fame and name of that illustrious and unrivalled man, far
more than my own paltry renown, and the trashy jingle of the crowd of
schools and upstarts, who pretend to rival, or even surpass him.Sooner
than a single leaf should be torn from _his_ laurel, it were better that
all which these men, and that I, as one of their set, have ever
written, should

   Line trunks, clothe spice, or, fluttering in a row,
   Befringe the rails of Bedlam, or Soho.""The most _perfect_ of our poets, and the purest of our moralists."--"He
is the _moral_ poet of all civilization; and, as such, let us hope that
he will one day be the national poet of mankind.He is the only poet
that never shocks; the only poet whose _faultlessness_ has been made his
reproach.Cast your eye over his productions; consider their extent, and
contemplate their variety:--pastoral, passion, mock-heroic, translation,
satire, ethics,--all excellent, and often perfect.If his great charm be
his _melody_, how comes it that foreigners adore him even in their
diluted translations?Mason has also farther recorded the resplendent fame of this
celebrated man; for in his _Musaeus_, a monody to the memory of Pope, he
invokes the shades of Chaucer, Spencer, and Milton, to do homage to his
departing spirit:--

                 ----to cheer thee at this rueful time
   While black death doth on thy heart-strings prey.So may we greet thee with a nobler strain,
   When soon we meet for aye in yon star-sprinkled plain.Milton thus begins _his_ homage:--

   Thrice hail, thou heaven-taught warbler, last and best
   Of all the train!Poet, in whom conjoin'd
   All that to ear, or heart, or head, could yield
   Rapture; harmonious, manly, clear, sublime!Accept this gratulation: may it cheer
   Thy sinking soul; or these corporeal ills
   Ought daunt thee, nor appal.Know, in high heav'n
   Fame blooms eternal on that spirit divine,
   Who builds immortal verse."[81]

Sir E. Brydges, in his "Letters on the Genius of Lord Byron," thus
characterizes the grace and sweetness of his pathetic powers, in his
_Eloisa_:--"When either his passions or imaginations _were_ roused, they
were deep, strong, and splendid.Notwithstanding _Eloisa_ was an
historical subject, his invention of circumstances of detail, his
imagery, the changes and turns of passion, the brilliancy of hues thrown
upon the whole, the eloquence, the tenderness, the fire, the inimitable
grace and felicity of language, were all the fruits of creative genius.This poem stands alone in its kind; never anticipated, and never likely
to be approached hereafter."Young uttered this sublime apostrophe when the death of Pope was first
announced to him:--

   _Thou, who couldst make immortals_, art thou dead?Of his _Essay on Man_, the Nouveau Dict.Portatif thus
speaks:--"Une metaphysique lumineuse, ornee des charmes de la poesie,
une morale touchante, dont les lecons penetrent le coeur et
convainquent l'esprit, des peintures vives, ou l'homme apprend a se
connoitre, pour apprendre a deviner meilleur; tels sont les principaux
caracteres qui distinguent le poeme Anglois.Son imagination est
egalement sage et feconde, elle prodigue les pensees neunes, et donne le
piquant de la nouveante, aux pensees anciennes; il embelloit les
matieres les plus seches, par la coloris d'une elocution noble, facile,
energeque, variee avec un art infini."In the gardens of Stowe is the following inscription to

                       ALEXANDER POPE,
           Who, uniting the correctness of judgment
                    To the fire of genius,
           By the melody and power of his numbers,
        Gave sweetness to sense, and grace to philosophy.He employed the pointed brilliancy of his wit
                    To chastise the vices,
                 And the eloquence of poetry
             To exalt the virtues of human nature;
           And, being without a rival in his own age,
   Imitated and translated with a spirit equal to the originals,
                   The best Poets of antiquity.WILLIAM KENT, whose portrait appears in Mr.Dallaway's rich edition of
the Anecdotes of Painting.Kent, with Bridgman, Pope, and Addison, have
been termed the fathers of landscape gardening.Walpole, after
reviewing the old formal style of our gardens, in language which it is
painful to me thus only to advert to, instead of copying at length, (for
I am fully "aware of the mischiefs which generally ensue in _meddling_
with the productions of genius"); and after stating that when _nature_
was taken into the plan, every step pointed out new beauties, and
inspired new ideas: "at that moment appeared Kent, painter enough to
taste the charms of landscape, bold and opiniative enough to dare and to
dictate, and born with a genius to strike out a great system from the
twilight of imperfect essays.He leaped the fence, and saw that all
nature was a garden.Thus the pencil of his imagination bestowed all the
arts of landscape on the scenes he handled.But of all the beauties he
added to the face of this beautiful country, none surpassed his
management of water.Thus, dealing in none but the colours of nature,
and catching its most favourable features, men saw a new creation
opening before their eyes."And again he calls him "the inventor of an
art that realizes painting, and improves nature: Mahomet imagined an
elysium, but Kent created many."The greatest of all authorities tells
us, that in Esher's peaceful grove, both

   Kent and Nature vied for Pelham's love.Mason, in his English Garden, thus panegyrises his elysian scenes:--

                       ---- Kent, who felt
   The pencil's power; but fix'd by higher hopes
   Of beauty than that pencil knew to paint,
   Work'd with the living lives that _nature_ lent,
   And realized his landscapes.Pope, as well as Kent, would, and Mr.Mason, must
each of them have read with high approbation the following remark of the
late Sir Uvedale Price:--"the noble and varied works of the eminent
painters of every age and every country, and those of their supreme
mistress, Nature, should be the great models of imitation."Whateley paints in glowing language, the genius of Kent, both at
Stowe, and at Claremont.George Mason thus honestly and finely
pleads for him:--"According to my own ideas, all that has since been
done by the most deservedly admired designers, as Southcote, Hamilton,
Lyttleton, Pitt, Shenstone, Morris, for themselves, and by Wright for
others, all that has been written on the subject, even the gardening
didactic poem, and the didactic essay on the picturesque, have proceeded
from Kent.Had Kent never exterminated the bounds of regularity, never
actually traversed the way to freedom of manner, would any of these
celebrated artists have found it of themselves?Theoretic hints from the
highest authorities, had evidently long existed without sufficient
effect.And had not these great masters actually executed what Kent's
example first inspired, them with, the design of executing, would the
subsequent writers on gardening have been enabled to collect materials
for precepts, or stores for their imaginations?Price acknowledges
himself an admirer of the water-scene at Blenheim.Would it ever have
appeared in its present shape, if no Kent had previously abolished the
stiffness of canals!If this original artist had barely rescued the
liquid element from the constraint of right lines and angles, that
service alone would have given him an indubitable claim to the respect
of posterity."Coventry, in his admirable exposure of the
grotesque absurdities in gardening, (being No.15 of the World) thus
speaks of Kent:--"The great Kent at length appeared in behalf of nature,
declared war against the taste in fashion, and laid the axe to the root
of artificial evergreens.Gardens were no longer filled with yews in the
shape of giants, Noah's ark cut in holly, St.George and the Dragon in
box, cypress lovers, laurustine bears, and all that race of root-born
monsters which flourished so long, and looked so tremendous round the
edges of every grass-plat.The great master above mentioned, truly the
disciple of nature, imitated her in the agreeable wildness and beautiful
irregularity of her plans, of which there are some noble examples still
remaining, that abundantly show the power of his creative genius."Dallaway, when treating on architecture, in his Anecdotes of the Arts,
says, "Kent designed the noble hall at Holkham, terminated by a vast
staircase, producing, in the whole, an imposing effect of grandeur not
to be equalled in England."He was a contemporary
therefore of Horace Walpole.He was buried in the vault at Chiswick,
belonging to his friend and patron, Lord Burlington.BRIDGMAN'S portrait was a private plate.It exhibited a kind-hearted,
hale old countenance.As he has the honour of being classed with Mr._Addison_, and with _Pope_, and _Kent_, as one of the champions who
established the picturesque scenery of landscape gardening, (which
_Bacon_, and _Spencer_, and _Milton_, as hath been observed, foresaw)
his portrait must surely be interesting.The engraved portrait which I
saw of him more than fifty years ago, made then a strong impression on
me.I
neither recollect its painter nor engraver; and it is so scarce, that
neither Mr.Smith, of Lisle Street, nor Mr.Evans, of Great Queen
Street, the intelligent collectors and illustrators of Granger, have
been able to obtain it.Perhaps it will be discovered that it was a
private plate, done at the expence of his generous and noble employer,
Lord Cobham.Of this once able and esteemed man, I can procure little
information.of Gardening says, "Lord Cobham seems to have
been occupied in re-modelling the grounds at _Stowe_, about the same
time that Pope was laying out his gardens at Twickenham.His lordship
began these improvements in 1714, _employing Bridgman_, whose plans and
views for altering old Stowe from the most rigid character of the
ancient style to a more open and irregular design, are still in
existence.Kent was employed a few years afterwards, first to paint the
hall, and afterwards in the double capacity of architect and
landscape-gardener; and the finest scenes there are his creation."The
finest views of Stowe gardens were drawn by Rigaud, and published by
_Sarah Bridgman_, in 1739.The fine and magnificent amphitheatre at the
Duke of Newcastle's, at Claremont, was designed, I believe, by Bridgman.When Queen Caroline added nearly three hundred acres from Hyde Park to
the gardens at Kensington, they were laid out by him.He also laid out
the gardens at Shardeloes, near Amersham.Walpole thus mentions
Bridgman, after alluding to the shears having been applied to the lovely
wildness of nature: "Improvements had gone on, till _London_ and _Wise_
had stocked our gardens with giants, animals, monsters, coats of arms,
and mottos, in yew, box and holly.Absurdity could go no farther, and
the tide turned._Bridgman_, the next fashionable designer of gardens,
was far more chaste; and whether from good sense, or that the nation had
been struck and reformed by the admirable paper in the Guardian, No.173, he banished verdant sculpture, and did not even revert to the
square precision of the foregoing age.He enlarged his plans, disdained
to make every division tally to its opposite; and though he still
adhered much to straight walks with high clipped hedges, they were only
his great lines, the rest he diversified by wilderness and with loose
groves of oak, though still within surrounding hedges.I have observed
in the garden at Gubbins, in Hertfordshire, many detached thoughts, that
strongly indicate the dawn of modern taste.As his reformation gained
footing, he ventured farther, and in the royal garden at Richmond, dared
to introduce cultivated fields, and even morsels of a forest appearance,
by the sides of those endless and tiresome walks that stretched out of
one into another without intermission.But this was not till other
innovators had broke loose too from rigid symmetry.But the capital
stroke, the leading step to all that has followed, was (_I believe the
first thought was Bridgman's_) the destruction of walls for boundaries,
and the invention of fosses,--an attempt then deemed so astonishing,
that the common people called them ha!to express their surprise
at finding a sudden and unperceived check to their walk.[83] One of the
first gardens planted in this simple though still formal style, was my
father's at Houghton.Eyre, an imitator of
Bridgman."PHILIP MILLER died at the age of eighty, and was emphatically styled by
foreigners _hortulanorum princeps_.Switzer bears testimony to his
"usual generosity, openness and freedom."Professor Martyn says, "he
accumulated no wealth from his respectable connection with the great, or
from the numerous editions of his works.He was of a disposition too
generous, and too careless of money, to become rich, and in all his
transactions observed more attention to integrity and honest fame, than
to any pecuniary advantages."Miller, by Maillet, prefixed to the "Dictionnaire des Jardiniers, de
Philipe Miller, traduit de l'Anglois," en 8 tom.Pulteney says of him, "He raised himself by his merit from a state
of obscurity to a degree of eminence, but rarely, if ever before,
equalled in the character of a gardener."Loudon (in that "varied
and voluminous mass of knowledge," his Encyclopaedia), thus
remarks:--"Miller, during his long career, had no considerable
competitor, until he approached the end of it, when several writers took
the advantage of his unwearied labours of near half a century, and fixed
themselves upon him, as various marine insects do upon a decaying
shell-fish.I except Hitt and Justice, who are both originals, as is
also Hill, after his fashion, but his gardening is not much founded in
experience."Miller married Ehret, whose fine taste
and botanical accuracy, and whose splendid drawings of plants, are the
finest ornaments of a botanical library.Miller fixed his residence adjoining that part of Chelsea
church-yard where he lies interred.Johnson gives a list of his writings, and of the different editions of
his celebrated Dictionary, which he terms "this great record of our
art."He farther does full justice to him, by associating his name, at
p.151, with that of "the immortal Swede, whose master mind
reduced the confusion and discord of botany to harmony."He calls Miller
"the perfect botanist and horticulturist."[84] The following spirited
tribute to Mr.Miller, appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for June,
1828:--

   "_Chelsea, June 5._

"MR.URBAN,--In the first volume, page 250, of the second edition of
_Faulkner's History of Chelsea_, just published, which contains a very
copious fund of historical, antiquarian, and biographical information, I
find inserted the monument and epitaph of Philip Miller, who was so
justly styled 'the prince of horticulture' by contemporary botanists,
and whose well-earned fame will last as long as the sciences of botany
and horticulture shall endure.The epitaph of this distinguished man is
correctly given; but the historian appears not to have duly appreciated,
if he was even aware of, the circumstances which induced the Fellows of
the Linnaean and Horticultural Societies of London to erect this grateful
tribute of respectful esteem to him, who in his life-time, had done more
than any individual, ancient or modern, towards enlarging the boundaries
of the science of horticulture, and very extensively the far more
difficult one of botany likewise.These he accomplished in the numerous
editions of his unrivalled Dictionary, and in his elaborate
introductions to botanical knowledge."The reasons which induced the above-mentioned societies to erect the
monument in question, were, chiefly, because neither monument, nor tomb,
nor even any recording public notice whatever (the'monumentum aere
perennius' of his own immortal works excepted) had previously been
provided by any one."The relatives of Miller were very few; he had no family, save two sons,
one of whom died early, and the other, Charles Miller, at the age of 78,
who spent the greater part of his long life in India, and returned not
until after his father's funeral; and over his grave, in the old
church-yard of Chelsea, a stone and sculptured brass record his name and
age and parentage, together with that of his aged and more distinguished
sire.This stone, too, was placed by the above-mentioned public-spirited
societies, (unto both which the writer has the honour to belong) at the
same time as the monument, stated by Faulkner, to the never-dying fame
of the father."But it is even now scarcely known, that when those meritorious
testimonials of public gratitude were showered over the memory of Philip
Miller, who had laboured so long and so successfully in the sciences
which he loved, there was only one individual in existence, and that a
very aged person, who had seen and attended the funeral of Miller, and
who alone could point out the very spot where the 'Prince of
Horticulture' was inhumed.This venerable person's name was Goodyer; he
was the parish clerk of Chelsea church for half a century, and died as
such in 1818, at the great age of ninety-four."Nevertheless, though last, it should not be concealed that I myself had
actually stated and published, in the winter of 1794-5, the neglectful
and opprobrious fact of Miller's having no single grave-stone, much less
a monument, nor even one funeral line, to designate the spot where
rested in its 'narrow house' the mortal relics of so great a man; see my
Observations on the Genus Mesembryanthemum, p.311-14; and, as every
reader may not possess that publication, the following extract from it
is added:--

"'So much for Miller; he, alas!who pleased so well, or, rather let me
say, he who instructed and edified so much, and was even caressed by the
great while living, now lies, forgotten by his friends, inhumed amongst
the common undistinguished dead, in the bleak cold yard of Chelsea
church, the very theatre of his best actions, the physic gardens of the
Worshipful Company of Apothecaries, at Chelsea, not half a mile distant,
without a tomb!nay, destitute of a single line to mark
the spot where rests, retired from all its cares and useful toils, the
time-worn frame of the 'Prince of Horticulture!'How are those
discerning foreigners, who so meritoriously rendered the language of his
Dictionary into their own, to judge of this?by what measure are they to
estimate the fact?Miller was the author of several publications,
besides the very numerous editions of his Dictionary and Kalendar.'His works are many of them enumerated in the Encyclo.The most full list is in Weston's Catalogue.His portrait is
engraved in metz by Houston, from after Coates.It is an oval, with a
_solitaire_.A short account of his life and writings was published at
Edinburgh in 1779.The most general account of him is in Hutchinson's
Biog.BATTY LANGLEY was born at Twickenham, where he resided.He was the
author of,

1.New Principles of Gardening, or the laying out and planting
parterres, groves, wildernesses, labyrinths, avenues, parks, &c. cuts,
1728, 4to.The sure Method of Improving Estates by Trees, 8vo.One of his
chapters is "On the magnitude and prodigious Growth of Trees."Pomona, or the Fruit Gardener, _with plates_, fol.At the end
is a letter to Mr.Langley, on Cyder, from Hugh Stafford, Esq.Langley, with the name of
Carwirtham, as the engraver or print-seller, 1741.SIR WILLIAM WATSON, an eminent physician, who died in 1787, wrote

1.Account of the Remains of Tradescant's Garden.Account of the Bishop of London's Garden, at Fulham.besides many valuable papers in several volumes of
these Transactions.He had the pleasure of introducing _Kalm_, as well as _Pallas_, to most
of the curious gardens in the environs of London.On the first
establishment of the British Museum, he was most active in furnishing
its garden, with no fewer than six hundred plants.Pulteney observes) "became the resort of the most ingenious and
illustrious experimental philosophers that England could boast."Pulteney has closed a very liberal memoir of him, by inserting Dr.Garthshore's testimony to the humane feeling, the social politeness, and
benignity of Sir William.His portrait is painted by Abbot, and engraved
by Ryder, 1791.There is a full account of him in Chalmers.WILLIAM HANBURY, the intimate friend of Churchill, and of
Lloyd, in his singular "History of the Charitable Foundations at Church
Langton," (and which exhibits his own benevolent heart, and great love
for planting and gardening) mentions, at page 185, a full-length
portrait of himself, by Penny.Had there been any other portrait of him,
it is likely Mr.Nicholls would have mentioned it in his Leicestershire,
for that gentleman, as well as Joseph Cradock, Esq.(both of whom are
lately deceased), would have been most likely to have known, if any
other portrait of this zealous planter did exist; so would Dr.Thomas
Warton, who always spoke of Mr.Hanbury as a generous, disinterested,
and benevolent man.Earlom engraved, in 1775, a three-quarter
metzotinto, from the above portrait by Penny.Hanbury also published
"A Complete Body of Planting and Gardening;" 2 vols.Also, "An
Essay on Planting, and a Scheme to make it conducive to the Glory of
God, and the Advantage of Society;" Oxford, 8vo.And "The
Gardener's New Calendar;" 8vo.Hanbury first conceived, in 1751, the establishing at Church
Langton, for benevolent purposes, his immense plantations; having
procured (particularly from North America) "almost every sort of seed
that could be procured."He proposed that an annual sermon should be
preached, either in praise of church music, the duty of decorating
religious houses, charity in general, or the wonders of the creation;
and that a hospital should be founded for the relief of the really
distressed.Even when his
first twenty thousand trees had just been planted out, the cattle
belonging to the tenants of Mrs.Dorothy Pickering, and Frances Byrd,
(who a few years after died worth two hundred thousand pounds, and whose
village biography is curiously dispersed throughout the above history)
were _purposely_ turned amongst the young trees, and in a little time
destroyed them all."Neither was this all; I was served for a trespass
with twenty-seven different copies of writs in one day (by their
attorney, Valentine Price, of Leicester); to such a degree of rage and
fury were these old gentlewomen raised, at what one should have thought
every heart would have rejoiced, and kindly lent an assisting hand."Hanbury gives many instances of the "venomous rage and passion" of these
two old women.They had, says he, "the mortification to find themselves
totally despised.Not a gentleman or lady would go near them, two
neighbouring clergymen excepted, who were invited to dine with them upon
venison."They attempted making a tool of the sow-gelder's son, to
enable them to carry on their mean plans, and sent him word, that
nothing they could do for him in the parish should be wanting.His
answer was, "that favours granted from such people, on such terms, could
never prosper, and he desired the other to tell them, they were _two old
bitches_."--"This summer, (says Mr.Hanbury,) was murdered, in the most
barbarous manner, the best spaniel that perhaps ever entered the field,
and the best greyhound that ever run.With these I had been often
entertained in my morning walks.To deprive me of these pleasures,
afforded me in my morning recreations, I had discharges from Mrs.Byrd, for taking them with me in their manors.To
these I paid no regard, and as they never brought any action on that
account, it may be supposed they could find no just cause to ground one.Some method is to be contrived to deprive me of
my attendants; the spaniel therefore was the first object destined for
destruction.He was small, and of a beautiful black, and had been used
to the parlour; and being absent about an hour, came reeling home in the
agonies of death; and in about a quarter of an hour after, died in the
seemingly most excruciating tortures.Suspecting some villany, I ordered
him to be opened, but found everything perfect and entire; I then
directed him to be skinned, and coming to the loins, found the traces of
a table-fork, which was stuck into the kidneys, and which was the
occasion of his speedy and dreadful death.A few days after this, my
best greyhound was stuck in the loins, in the like barbarous manner,
which brought on the same kind of speedy and agonizing death; and this
was the catastrophe of these two noted dogs, which had been much talked
of, and were famous amongst sportsmen, as being most perfect in their
kind.Some time after this, their game-keeper, in company with his
nephew, _buried two dogs alive_; they were the property of Mr.Wade, a
substantial grazier, who had grounds contiguous to a place of cover,
called Langton Caudle, where was often game; and where the unfortunate
two dogs, straying from their master, had been used to hunt.The
game-keeper and his nephew being shooting in this place, the dogs, upon
the report of the gun, made towards them.Their shooting them or hanging
them would have been merciful, but they buried them alive; and what
words can express the abhorrence of such barbarity to such innocent
creatures following the dictates of nature?To prevent a possibility of
their scratching a way out, they covered them down with black thorns;
over these they laid a sufficient quantity of earth and one large stone,
which the rammed down with their heels.Day after day the dogs were
heard in this place, with the howling, barking noise of dogs that were
lost.Some people resorted to find them out, and wondered it was to no
purpose, for nobody could suspect the dogs were under ground; and thus
after calling and whistling them, and seeking them for some time,
returned, amazed that lost dogs should continue so long in that place;
but a sight of none could ever be had.The noise was fancied to come
sometimes from one quarter, sometimes from another; and when they came
near the place they were in, they ceased howling, expecting their
deliverance was at hand.I myself heard them _ten days_ after they had
been buried; and seeing some people at a distance, enquired what dogs
they were._They are some dogs that are lost, Sir_, said they; _they
have been lost some time_.I concluded only some poachers had been there
early in the morning, and by a precipitate flight had left their dogs
behind them.In short, the howling and barking of these dogs was heard
for near three weeks, when it ceased.Wade's dogs were missing, but
he could not suspect those to be his; and the noise ceasing, the
thoughts, wonder, and talking about them, soon also ceased.Some time
after, a person being amongst the bushes where the howling was heard,
discovered some disturbed earth, and the print of men's heels ramming it
down again very close; and seeing Mr.Wade's servant, told him, he
thought something had been buried there._Then_, said the man, _it is
our dogs, and they have been buried alive: I will go and fetch a spade,
and will find them, if I dig all Caudle over_.He soon brought a spade,
and upon removing the top earth, came to the blackthorns, and then to
the dogs, the biggest of which had eat the loins and greatest share of
the hind parts of the little one."Hanbury states the deaths of
these two sisters in the course of a few months after.The sums they
accumulated by their penurious way of living, were immense.They
bequeathed legacies by will to almost every body that were no kin to
them except their assiduous attorney, Valentine Price, to whom they left
nothing."But what is strange and wonderful, though their charities in
their life-time at Langton were a sixpenny loaf a week only, which was
divided into as many parts as there were petitioners, and distributed by
eleven of the clock on a Sunday, unless they left the town the day
before, which was often the case, and when the poor were sure to fail of
their bounty; these gentlewomen, at the death of the last, bequeathed by
will upwards of twelve thousand pounds to the different hospitals and
religious institutions in the kingdom.A blaze of goodness issued from
them at last, and thus ended these two poor, unhappy, uncharitable,
charitable old gentlewomen."Marshall calls him, "the indefatigable Hanbury, whose immense
labours are in a manner lost to the public."Hanbury did, in describing the beauty of trees and shrubs: this is
visible in the extracts which Mr.Marshall has made in his "Planting and
Rural Ornament."WILLIAM SHENSTONE, Esq., justly celebrated for his pure and classic
taste in landscape gardening.His tender and pathetic feelings shine
throughout most of his works; and the sweetness and simplicity of his
temper and manners, endeared him to the neighbourhood and to his
acquaintance.Johnson says, his life was unstained by any crime.He
farther says of him, "He began from this time to entangle his walks, and
to wind his waters; which he did with such judgment and such fancy, as
made his little domain the envy of the great and the admiration of the
skilful.His house was mean, and he did not improve it; his care was of
his grounds.When he came home from his walks, he might find his floor
flooded by a shower through the broken roof; but could spare no money
for its reparation.In time his expences brought clamours about him,
that overpowered the lamb's bleat and the linnet's song; and his groves
were haunted by beings very different from fawns and fairies.He spent
his estate in adorning it, and his death was probably hastened by his
anxieties.He was a lamp that spent its oil in blazing.It is said, that
if he had lived a little longer he would have been assisted by a
pension: such bounty could not have been ever more properly bestowed;
but that it was ever asked is not certain; it is too certain that it
never was enjoyed."His intimate friend, Robert Dodsley, thus speaks of him: "Tenderness,
indeed, in every sense of the word, was his peculiar characteristic; his
friends, his domestics, his poor neighbours, all daily experienced his
benevolent turn of mind.He was no economist; the generosity of his
temper prevented him from paying a proper regard to the use of money: he
exceeded, therefore, the bounds of his paternal fortune, which before he
died was considerably incumbered.But when one recollects the perfect
paradise he had raised around him, the hospitality with which he lived,
his great indulgence to his servants, his charities to the indigent, and
all done with an estate not more than three hundred pounds a year, one
should rather be led to wonder that he left any thing behind him, than
to blame his want of economy.He left, however, more than sufficient to
pay all his debts; and, by his will, appropriated his whole estate for
that purpose."His portrait is prefixed to his works, published in 3 vols.His second volume contains his "Unconnected Thoughts on Landscape
Gardening;" and the description of the celebrated _Leasowes_, in that
volume, was written by ("the modest, sensible, and humane") Robert
Dodsley.His Epistolary Correspondence appeared in 2 vols.The
title pages of the above first three volumes are attractive from their
vignette, or rural embellishments.A portrait of Shenstone was taken in
1758, by Ross, which Hall engraved for Dodsley, in 1780; and this
picture by Ross was in the possession of the late most worthy Dr.Graves, of Claverton, who died a few years ago, at the advanced age of
ninety.Bell's edition of the Poets has a neat copy of this portrait.Graves wrote "Recollections of the late William Shenstone."He also
dedicated an urn to him, and inscribed these lines thereon:--

   Stranger!if woods and lawns like these,
   If rural scenes thy fancy please,
   Ah!stop awhile, and pensive view
   Poor Shenstone's urn: who oft, like you,
   These woods and lawns well-pleased has rov'd,
   And oft these rural scenes approv'd.Like him, be thou fair virtue's friend,
   And health and peace thy steps attend.Shenstone died in 1763, and is buried in Hales Owen church yard.An
urn is placed in the church to his memory, thus inscribed:--

   Whoe'er thou art, with reverence tread
   These sacred mansions of the dead.--
   Not that the monumental bust
   Or sumptuous tomb HERE guards the dust
   Of rich or great: (Let wealth, rank, birth,
   Sleep undistinguish'd in the earth;)
   This simple urn records a name
   That shines with more exalted fame.if genius, taste refined,
   A native elegance of mind;
   If virtue, science, manly sense;
   If wit, that never gave offence;
   The clearest head, the tenderest heart,
   In thy esteem e'er claim'd a part;
   Ah!smite thy breast, and drop a tear,
   For, know, THY Shenstone's dust lies here.Mason thus speaks of Shenstone:

                          ----"Nor thou
   Shalt pass without thy meed, thou son of peace,
   Who knew'st perchance to harmonize thy shades
   Still softer than thy song; yet was that song
   Nor rude nor unharmonious, when attuned
   To pastoral plaint, or tales of slighted love."Whateley pays his memory the following tribute, previous to his
masterly survey of his far-famed and enchanting seat: "An allusion to
the ideas of pastoral poetry evidently enters into the design of the
Leasowes, where they appear so lovely as to endear the memory of their
author, and justify the reputation of Mr.Shenstone, who inhabited, made
and directed that celebrated place.It is a perfect picture of his mind,
simple, elegant, and amiable, and will always suggest a doubt whether
the spot inspired his verses, or whether, in the scenes which he formed,
he only realized the pastoral images which abound in his songs."[85]
George Mason, in many pages, pays high compliments to Shenstone's taste:
"Paine's Hill has every mark of creative genius, and Hagley of
correctest fancy; but the most intimate _alliance with nature_ was
formed by Shenstone."Marshall, in his "Planting and Rural
Ornament," has some critical remarks on the _Leasowes_, the expences in
perfecting which threw Shenstone "on the rack of poverty, and probably
hastened the dissolution of an amiable and valuable man."He says that
_Enville_ was originally designed by Shenstone, and that the cascade
and chapel were spoken of, with confidence, as his.[86]


LORD KAMES.His portrait is prefixed to the memoirs of him, by Lord
Woodhouselee, in 2 vols.There is an edition of the same
work, in 3 vols.1814, with the same portrait, which is engraved
from a drawing by D. Martin.His "Gentleman Farmer" spread his fame
through Scotland.Smellie,
in his Literary Lives of Gregory, Home, Hume, Adam Smith, and Lord
Kames, after giving many interesting particulars of the latter, and
after noticing his benevolence to the poor, during the whole course of
his long life, proceeds:--"One great feature in the character of Lord
Kames, besides his literary talents, and his public spirit, was a
remarkable innocency of mind.He not only never indulged in detraction,
but when any species of scandal was exhibited in his company, he either
remained silent, or endeavoured to give a turn to the conversation.As
natural consequences of this amiable disposition, he never meddled with
politics, even when politics ran to indecent lengths in this country;
and what is still more remarkable, he never wrote a sentence,
notwithstanding his numerous publications, without a direct and a
manifest intention to benefit his fellow creatures.In his temper he was
naturally warm, though kindly and affectionate.In the friendships he
formed, he was ardent, zealous and sincere.So far from being inclined
to irreligion, as some ignorant bigots insinuated, few men possessed a
more devout habit of thought.A constant sense of Deity, and a
veneration for Providence, dwelt upon his mind.From this source arose
that propensity, which appears in all his writings, of investigating
final causes, and tracing the wisdom of the Supreme Author of Nature."He had the honour to be highly esteemed by the celebrated Mrs.1790, which gives an engraved portrait of
him, being a copy of the above, thus speaks: "He was one of the very
first who to great legal knowledge, added a considerable share of polite
literature.He arrived at the highest rank to which a lawyer could
attain in his own country; and he has left to the world such literary
productions, as will authorize his friends to place him, if not in the
highest, yet much above the lowest, class of elegant and polite writers.He died in 1783, leaving to the world a proof, that an attention to the
abstrusest branches of learning, is not incompatible with the more
pleasing pursuits of taste and polite literature."His pure taste in landscape scenery, is acknowledged by Mr.81 of the Encyclopaedia of Gardening._Blair Drummond_ will
long be celebrated as having been his residence, and he there displayed
his superior taste in planting and improving.In his "Elements of Criticism," (a truly original work) there is a
distinct chapter on architecture and gardening.He therein thus
addresses the reader:--"These cursory observations upon gardening, shall
be closed with some reflections that must touch every reader.Rough
uncultivated ground, dismal to the eye, inspires peevishness and
discontent: may not this be one cause of the harsh manners of savages?A
field richly ornamented, containing beautiful objects of various kinds,
displays in full lustre the goodness of the Deity, and the ample
provision he has made for our happiness.Ought not the spectator to be
filled with gratitude to his Maker, and with benevolence to his fellow
creatures?Other fine arts may be perverted to excite irregular and even
vicious emotions; but gardening, which inspires the purest and most
refined pleasures, cannot fail to promote every good affection.The
gaiety and harmony of mind it produceth, inclineth the spectator to
communicate his satisfaction to others, and to make them happy as he is
himself, and tends naturally to establish in him a habit of humanity and
benevolence."JOHN ABERCROMBIE'S manly and expressive countenance is best given in the
portrait prefixed to an edition in 2 vols.1, 1783,
by Fielding and Debrett.He is also drawn at full-length at his age of
seventy-two, in the sixteenth edition, printed in 1800, with a pleasing
view of a garden in the back-ground, neatly engraved.This honest,
unassuming man, persevered "through a long life of scarcely interrupted
health," in the ardent pursuit of his favourite science.The tenor of
his life exemplified how much a garden calms the mind, and tranquilly
sets at rest its turbulent passions.of
Gardening, after giving some interesting points of his history, thus
concludes: "In the spring of 1806, being in his eightieth year, he met
with a severe fall, by which he broke the upper part of his thigh bone.This accident, which happened to him on the 15th of April, terminated in
his death.After lying in a very weak exhausted state, without much
pain, he expired in the night, between April and May, as St.He was lamented by all who knew him, as cheerful,
harmless, and upright."One of his biographers thus relates of him:
"Abercrombie from a fall down stairs in the dark, died at the age of
eighty, and was buried at St.He was present at the famous
battle of Preston Pans, which was fought close to his father's garden
walls.For the last twenty years of his life he lived chiefly on tea,
using it three times a-day: his pipe was his first companion in the
morning, and last at night.[87] He never remembered to have taken a dose
of physic in his life, prior to his last fatal accident, nor of having a
day's illness but once."A list of his works appears in Watts's Bibl.Brit., and a most full one in Johnson's History of English Gardening,
who, with many collected particulars of Abercrombie, relates the great
and continually increasing sale of some of his works.LAUNCELOT BROWNE, Esq.His portrait was painted by Dance, and engraved by Sherwin.Under this
portrait are engraved the following lines, from the pen of Mr.Mason,
which are also inscribed on the tomb of Mr.Browne, in the church of
Fen-Staunton, Huntingdonshire:

   _Ye sons of elegance, who truly taste
     The simple charms which genuine art supplies,
   Come from the sylvan scenes his genius drew,
     And offer here your tributary sighs.But know, that more than genius slumbers here,
     Virtues were his that art's best powers transcend,
   Come, ye superior train!who these revere,
     And weep the christian, husband, father, friend._

Mr.Browne this elegant compliment: "Did living
artists come within my plan, I should be glad to do justice to Mr.Browne; but he may be a gainer by being reserved for some abler pen."This celebrated landscape gardener died suddenly, in Hertford Street,
May Fair, on the 6th of February, 1783, on his return from a visit to
his old friend the Earl of Coventry.Browne, though bred a common
gardener at Stowe, possessed a cultivated mind, and his society was much
courted.called him "a most agreeable, unassuming
man."He was consulted by most of the
nobility and gentry, and the places he laid out or altered, were, as Mr.Repton has given a list of
his principal works.It has been the fate of this eminent master of landscape embellishment,
to be severely censured by some, and lavishly praised by others.The
late keen and consummate observer of landscape scenery, Sir Uvedale
Price, harshly condemns the too frequent cold monotony and tameness of
many of Mr.Browne's creations, and his never transfusing into his works
any thing of the taste and spirit which prevail in the poet Mason's
precepts and descriptions; and in one of his acute, yet pleasant pages,
he alludes to his having but _one_ and the same plan of operation;
_Sangrado_-like, treating all disorders in the same manner.Perhaps the
too general smoothness and tameness of Mr.Browne's pleasure-grounds ill
accorded with Sir Uvedale's enthusiasm for the more sublime views of
forest scenery, rapid and stony torrents and cascades, wild entangled
dingles, and craggy breaks; or with the high and sublime notions he had
imbibed from the rich scenery of nature so often contemplated by him in
the landscapes of _Claude_, or in those of _Rubens_, _Gaspar Poussin_,
_Salvator Rosa_, or of _Titian_, "the greatest of all landscape
painters."Perhaps Sir Uvedale preferred "unwedgeable and gnarled oaks,"
to "the tameness of the poor pinioned trees of a gentleman's plantation,
drawn up straight," or the wooded banks of a river, to the "bare shaven
border of a canal."[88]

Daines Barrington happily said, "Kent has been succeeded by Browne, who
hath undoubtedly great merit in laying out pleasure-grounds; but I
conceive that in some of his plans, I see rather traces of the
kitchen-gardener of old Stowe, than of Poussin or Claude Lorraine: I
could wish, therefore, that Gainsborough gave the design, and that
Browne executed it.Loudon observes, "that Browne must have
possessed considerable talents, the extent of his reputation abundantly
proves; but that he was imbued with much of that taste for picturesque
beauty, which distinguished the works of Kent, Hamilton, and Shenstone,
we think will hardly be asserted by any one who has observed attentively
such places as are known to be his creations."George Mason candidly
asks, "why Browne should be charged with all the defects of those that
have called themselves his followers, I have seen no good reason
alleged, nor can I suppose it possible to produce one."Many of his
imitators exhibited so little talent in their creations, that Mr.Browne's name considerably suffered in the estimation of many.Gilpin speaks of Browne's improvements at Blenheim in high terms.Marshall in his Survey of Stowe and Fisherwick, in vol.i. of his
"Planting and Rural Ornament," and at p.384, pays a fair tribute to
him.Much general information respecting him may be seen in Mr.Loudon's
chapter "Of the rise, progress, and present state of gardening in the
British Isles."The candour and rich conciseness of this review,
embraces the whole _magic of the art_, as respects landscape
gardening.[90]


FRANCIS ZAVIER VISPRE wrote "A Dissertation on the Growth of Wine in
England", Bath, 8vo.Vispre died poor, between thirty and
forty years ago, in St.He excelled in painting portraits
in crayons: Sir Joshua much esteemed him.He was a most inoffensive man,
of the mildest manners, and of the purest integrity.I have seen his
portrait in crayons, in an oval, finely finished by himself, but know
not now where that is.On his mode of training the vine _very near the
ground_, see p.WILLIAM MASON, precentor and canon of York, died in 1797.His friend,
Sir Joshua Reynolds, painted an impressive portrait of him, which is
engraved by Doughty.A masterly copy of this fine portrait is in Mr.A copy is also prefixed to the edition
of his works, in 4 vols.His
portrait was also taken by Vaslet, and engraved by Carter, 1771.It is a
large metz etching.He translated Du Fresnoy's Art of Painting, to which
Sir Joshua added some notes.Mason has prefixed an Epistle to Sir
Joshua, which thus concludes:

   And oh!if ought thy poet can pretend
   Beyond his favourite wish, to _call thee friend_:
   Be it that here his tuneful toil has dress'd
   The muse of _Fresnoy_ in a modern vest;
   And, with what skill his fancy could bestow,
   Taught the close folds to take an easier flow;
   Be it that here, thy partial smile approv'd
   The pains he lavish'd on the art he lov'd.Mason's attachment to painting was an early one, is conspicuous in
many of his writings, and in his English Garden, is visible throughout:

                                ----feel ye there
   What _Reynolds_ felt, when first the Vatican
   Unbarr'd her gates, and to his raptur'd eye
   Gave all the god-like energy that flow'd
   From _Michael's_ pencil; feel what _Garrick_ felt,
   When first he breath'd the soul of _Shakspeare's_ page.Sir Joshua, in his will, bequeaths his then supposed portrait of Milton
to Mr.Gray thus observes of Mason, when at Cambridge:--"So ignorant of the
world and its ways, that this does not hurt him in one's opinion; so
sincere and so undisguised, that no mind with a spark of generosity
would ever think of hurting him, he lies so open to injury; but so
indolent, that if he cannot overcome this habit, all his good qualities
will signify nothing at all."Mason, in 1754, found a patron in the Earl of Holderness, who
presented him with the living of _Aston_, in Yorkshire.This sequestred
village was favourable to his love of poetry and picturesque scenery;
which displayed itself at large in his English Garden, and was the
foundation of his lasting friendship with Mr.Gilpin, who to testify his
esteem, dedicated to him his _Observations on the Wye_.Shore, of Norton Hall, (the friend of Priestley), thus
mentions _Aston_:--"That truly conscientious, and truly learned and
excellent man, Mr.Lindsey, spent a whole week in this neighbourhood.He
was during that time the guest of his friend Mr.Mason, who was residing
on his rectory at _Aston_, the biographer of Gray, and one whose taste,
gave beauty, and poetry, celebrity, to that cheerful village."Gray, terminated only with the life of the latter.Mason was visited at Aston, for the last time, by him.Mason was from Pembroke-hall, in May, 1771, and on the
31st of the next month, and at that place, this sublime genius paid the
debt of nature.Mason, and
inscribed on the monument in Westminster Abbey:

   No more the Grecian muse unrivall'd reigns;
     To Britain let the nations homage pay:
   She felt a Homer's fire in Milton's strains,
     A Pindar's rapture in the lyre of Gray.He farther evinced his attachment to this elegant scholar by publishing
his poems and letters, to which he prefixed memoirs of him.He commences
the third book of his English Garden with an invocation to his memory,
and records, in lofty language, his eye glistening and his accents
glowing, when viewing the charms of all-majestic Nature--the heights of
Skiddaw and the purple crags of Borrowdale.And on a rustic alcove, in
the garden at Aston, which he dedicated to Mr.Gray, he inscribed this
stanza from the celebrated elegy:

   _Here scatter'd oft, the loveliest of the year,
     By hands unseen, are showers of violets found;
   The red-breast loves to build and warble here,
     And little footsteps lightly print the ground._

Mr.Mason married in 1765 a most amiable woman; she fell at length into
a rapid consumption, and at Bristol hot-wells she died.Mason while at that place, is full of eloquence; upon which the
latter observes, "I opened it almost at the precise moment when it would
be necessarily most affecting.His epitaph on the monument he erected on
this lady, in the Bristol cathedral, breathes such tender feeling and
chaste simplicity, that it can need no apology for being noticed here:

   Take, holy earth!all that my soul holds dear;
     Take that best gift which heav'n so lately gave:
   To Bristol's fount I bore with trembling care
     Her faded form: she bow'd to taste the wave
   And died.Does youth, does beauty, read the line?breathe a strain divine:
     E'en from the grave thou shalt have power to charm.Bid them be chaste, be innocent, like thee;
     Bid them in duty's sphere as meekly move;
   And if so fair, from vanity as free;
     As firm in friendship, and as fond in love.Tell them, though 'tis an awful thing to die,
     ('Twas e'en to thee) yet the dread path once trod,
   Heav'n lifts its everlasting portals high,
     And bids "the pure in heart behold their God."Mason's death, he began his English
Garden, and invokes the genius both of poetry and painting

                         ----that at my birth
   Auspicious smil'd, and o'er my cradle dropp'd
   Those magic seeds of Fancy, which produce
   A Poet's feeling, and a Painter's eye.----with lenient smiles to deign to cheer,
   At this sad hour, my desolated soul.For deem not ye that I resume the lyre
   To court the world's applause; my years mature
   Have learn'd to slight the toy.No, 'tis to soothe
   That agony of heart, which they alone,
   Who best have lov'd, who best have been belov'd,
   Can feel, or pity: sympathy severe!Which she too felt, when on her pallid lip
   The last farewell hung trembling, and bespoke
   A wish to linger here, and bless the arms
   She left for heav'n.--She died, and heav'n is her's!Be mine, the pensive solitary balm
   That recollection yields.While memory holds her seat, thine image still
   Shall reign, shall triumph there; and when, as now,
   Imagination forms a nymph divine,
   To lead the fluent strain, thy modest blush,
   Thy mild demeanour, thy unpractis'd smile,
   Shall grace that nymph, and sweet Simplicity
   Be dress'd (ah, meek Maria!)Thomas Warton thus speaks of the above poem, when reviewing Tusser's
Husbandry:--"Such were the rude beginnings in the English language of
didactic poetry, which, on a kindred subject, the present age has seen
brought to perfection, by the happy combination of judicious precepts,
with the most elegant ornaments of language and imagery, in Mr.His Elfrida and Caractacus, are admired for boldness of
conception and sublime description.Elfrida was set to Music by Arne,
and again by Giardini.Mason's
success with both these dramatic poems was beyond his most sanguine
expectation.Mason; these lines are its concluding
part:

   Weave the bright wreath, to worth departed just,
   And hang unfading chaplets on his bust;
   While pale Elfrida, bending o'er his bier,
   Breathes the soft sigh and sheds the graceful tear;
   And stern Caractacus, with brow depress'd
   Clasps the cold marble to his mailed breast.In lucid troops shall choral virgins throng,
   With voice alternate chant their poet's song.in golden characters record
   Each firm, immutable, immortal word!"Those last two lines from the final chorus of Elfrida, (says Miss
Seward), admirably close this tribute to the memory of him who stands
second to Gray, as a lyric poet; whose English Garden is one of the
happiest efforts of didactic verse, containing the purest elements of
horticultural taste, dignified by freedom and virtue, rendered
interesting by episode, and given in those energetic and undulating
measures which render blank verse excellent; whose unowned satires, yet
certainly his, the heroic epistle to Sir William Chambers, and its
postscript, are at once original in their style, harmonious in their
numbers, and pointed in their ridicule; whose tragedies are the only
pathetic tragedies which have been written in our language upon the
severe Greek model.The Samson Agonistes bears marks of a stronger, but
also of an heavier hand, and is unquestionably less touching than the
sweet Elfrida, and the sublime Caractacus."Mason, in 1756 published four Odes."It would be difficult to say,
(says the biographer of the annual Necrology of 1797,) which is most to
be admired, the vividness of the conception, or the spirit of liberty,
and the ardent love of independance throughout.The address to Milton in
his Ode to Memory, and to Andrew Marvel, in that to Independance, cannot
be too much admired.At the period when the Middlesex election was so
much agitated, he united with those independant freeholders, who, by
their declarations and petitions, throughout the nation, opposed
corruption, and claimed a reform in parliament; and when the county of
York assembled in 1779, he was of the committee, and had a great share
in drawing up their spirited resolutions.The animated vindication of
the conduct of the freeholders, and other papers, though printed
anonimously in the newspapers, and so printed in Mr.Wyvill's collection
of political tracts, in 3 vols.This conduct rendered him obnoxious to the court party.He
was at this time one of the king's chaplains, but when it became his
turn to preach before the royal family, the queen appointed another
person to supply his place.It has been observed, that his sentiments in
a later period of his life, took a colour less favourable to liberty.Whether alarmed at the march of the French revolution, or from the
timidity of age, we know not.His friend Horace Walpole, charges him
with flat apostacy:" The _Heroic Epistle_ to Sir W. Chambers, and the
_Heroic Postscript_, are now positively said to have been written by Mr.Thomas Warton observed, "they may have been written by
Walpole, and buckramed by Mason."The late Sir U. Price, in the generous and patriotic conclusion of his
letter to Mr.Repton, pays a delicate compliment to the genius of Mr.Mason in whatever concerns rural scenery; and his respect for Mr.Mason,
and his high opinion of his talents, is farther shewn in pp.295 and
371 of his first volume, and in p.Mason to have been the author of the Heroic Epistle, and
after paying a high compliment to his general poetry, thus concludes his
generous tribute:

   Whence is that groan?no more Britannia sleeps,
   But o'er her lov'd Musaeus bends and weeps.Lo, every Grecian, every British muse
   Scatter the recent flowers and gracious dews
   Where MASON lies!And in his breast each soft affection dwelt,
   That love and friendship know; each sister art,
   With all that colours, and that sounds impart,
   All that the sylvan theatre can grace,
   All in the soul of MASON found their place!Low sinks the laurell'd head: in Mona's land
   I see them pass, 'tis Mador's drooping band,
   To harps of woe, in holiest obsequies,
   In yonder grave, they chant, our Druid lies!In the life of this justly celebrated physician, by Miss
Seward, she informs us, that in the year 1770, he sat to Mr.Wright of
Derby; and that it was "a contemplative portrait, of the most perfect
resemblance."He was then in
his thirty-eighth year.Thornton, in his superb work on botany, has
given a fine portrait of Dr.Darwin, at a more advanced period of his
life.It breathes intelligence in every feature, and is a masterly
likeness.Archdeacon Clive preserved a highly-finished
miniature portrait of him, which was ordered by Dr.Darwin for the
express purpose of being presented to this worthy clergyman, whom he so
much esteemed.Zoonomia, or the Laws of Organic Life.Phytologia, or the Philosophy of Agriculture and Gardening, 4to."A vast field of treasured observation and scientific literature."Lord Byron, and others, have been severe on this poem.The lines,
however, on the soldier's wife and infants, after watching the battle of
Minden--those animated ones to Mr.Howard--or when the mother, during
the plague in London, commits her children to the grave,

   _When o'er the friendless bier no rites were read,
   No dirge slow chanted, and no pall outspread;_

these make one gladly acknowledge, that pathetic powers were the gift of
Darwin's muse.The sublimity of the following address to our _first_
daring aeronaut, merits insertion:

   --Rise, great Mongolfier!urge thy venturous flight
   High o'er the moon's pale, ice-reflected light;
   High o'er the pearly star, whose beamy horn
   Hangs in the east, gay harbinger of morn;
   Leave the red eye of Mars on rapid wing,
   Jove's silver guards, and Saturn's dusky ring;
   Leave the fair beams, which issuing from afar
   Play with new lustres round the Georgian star;
   Shun with strong oars the sun's attractive throne,
   The burning Zodiac, and the milky Zone:
   Where headlong comets with increasing force
   Through other systems bend their burning course!For thee Cassiope her chair withdraws,
   For thee the Bear retracts his shaggy paws;
   High o'er the north thy golden orb shall roll,
   And blaze eternal round the wondering pole.[92]

Miss Seward, after stating that professional generosity distinguished
Dr.Darwin's medical practice at Lichfield, farther says, that
"diligently also did he attend to the health of the poor in that city,
and afterwards at Derby, and supplied their necessities by food, and all
sorts of charitable assistance.In each of those towns, _his_ was the
cheerful board of almost open-housed hospitality, without extravagance
or pride; deeming ever the first unjust, the latter unmanly.Generosity,
wit and science, were his household gods."[93] She again states that
when he removed from Lichfield to Derby, "his renown, as a physician,
still increased as time rolled on, and his mortal life declined from its
noon.Patients resorted to him more and more, from every part of the
kingdom, and often from the continent.All ranks, all orders of society,
all religions, leaned upon his power to ameliorate disease, and to
prolong existence.The rigid and sternly pious, who had attempted to
renounce his aid, from a superstition that no blessing would attend the
prescriptions of a sceptic, sacrificed, after a time, their
superstitious scruples to their involuntary consciousness of his mighty
skill."Mathias, though he severely criticizes some of Dr.Darwin's
works, yet he justly calls him "this very ingenious man, and most
excellent physician, for such he undoubtedly was."[Illustration]

From scattered passages in Miss Seward's Life of him, one can easily
trace the delight he took (notwithstanding his immense professional
engagements,) in the scenery of nature and gardens;--witness his
frequent admiration of the tangled glen and luxuriant landscape at
_Belmont_, its sombre and pathless woods, impressing us with a sense of
solemn seclusion, like the solitudes of _Tinian_, or _Juan Fernandes_,
with its "silent and unsullied stream," which the admirable lines he
addresses to the youthful owner of that spot so purely and temperately
allude to:--

   O, friend to peace and virtue, ever flows
   For thee my silent and unsullied stream,
   Pure and untainted as thy blameless life!Let no gay converse lead thy steps astray,
   To mix my chaste wave with immodest wine,
   Nor with the poisonous cup, which Chemia's hand
   Deals (fell enchantress!)So shall young Health thy daily walks attend,
   Weave for thy hoary brow the vernal flower
   Of cheerfulness, and with his nervous arm
   Arrest th' inexorable scythe of Time.So early, and indeed throughout his whole life, did Dr.Darwin enforce
the happy consequences of temperance and sobriety; from his conviction
of the pernicious effects of all kinds of intemperance on the youthful
constitution.He had an absolute horror of spirits of all sorts, however
diluted.Pure water was, throughout the greater part of his temperate
life, his favourite beverage.He has been severely censured (no doubt
very justly so), for some of his religious prejudices.Old Walter Mapes,
the jovial canon of Salisbury, precentor of Lincoln, and arch-deacon of
Oxford, in the eleventh century, considered _water_ as fit only for
_heretics_.One may again trace his fondness for the rich scenery of nature, when he
in 1777 purchased a wild umbrageous valley near Lichfield, with its
mossy fountain of the purest water.The
botanic skill displayed by him on this spot, did not escape the
searching eye of Mr.of
Gardening, he pays a deserved compliment to him.[94] Miss Seward wrote
some lines on this favoured valley, and these are part of them:

   O!may no ruder step these bowers profane,
   No midnight wassailers deface the plain;
   And when the tempests of the wintry day
   Blow golden autumn's varied leaves away,
   Winds of the north, restrain your icy gales,
   Nor chill the bosom of these hallow'd vales.His attachment to gardens, induced him to honour the memory of Mr.Mason, by lines once intended for his monument; and he was suggesting
improvements at the priory at Derby (and which he had just described the
last morning of his life in a sprightly letter to a friend), when the
fatal signal was given, and a few hours after, on the 18th of April,
1802, and in his sixty-ninth year, he sunk into his chair and expired."Thus in one hour (says his affectionate biographer) was extinguished
that vital light, which the preceding hour had shone in flattering
brightness, promising duration; (such is often _the cunning flattery of
nature_), that light, which through half a century, had diffused its
radiance and its warmth so widely; that light in which penury had been
cheered, in which science had expanded; to whose orb poetry had brought
all her images; before whose influence disease had continually
retreated, and death so often "turned aside his levelled dart!Darwin, as to his religious principles or prejudices, displayed
great errors of judgment in his _Zoonomia_, there can be no doubt.An
eminent champion of Christianity, truly observed, that Dr.Darwin "was
acquainted with more links in the chain of _second_ causes, than had
probably been known to any individual, who went before him; but that he
dwelt so much, and so _exclusively_ on second causes, that he too
generally seems to have forgotten that there is a first."For these
errors he must long since have been called to his account, before one
who can appreciate those errors better than we can.Though the _Accusing
Spirit_ must have blushed when he gave them in, yet, let us hope, that
the _Recording Angel_, out of mercy to his humane heart, and his many
good and valuable qualities, may have blotted them out for ever.WILLIAM GILPIN, who, as Mr.Dallaway, in his Observations on the
Arts, observes, "possesses unquestionably the happy faculty to paint
with words;" and who farther highly compliments him in his supplementary
chapter on Modern Gardening, annexed to his enriched edition of Mr.The Topographer says he "describes with the
language of a master, the artless scenes of uncultivated nature."Walpole in his postscript to his Catalogue of Engravers, after
premising, that it might, perhaps, be worth while "to melt down this
volume and new cast it," pays this tribute to him: "Were I of authority
sufficient to name my successor, or could prevail on him to condescend
to accept an office which he could execute with more taste and ability;
from whose hands could the public receive so much information and
pleasure as from the author of the _Essay on Prints_, and from the
_Tours_, &c.?And when was the public ever instructed by the pen and
pencil at once, with equal excellence in the style of both, but by Mr.Gilpin written nothing more than his "Lectures on the
Catechism," that alone would have conferred on him the name of a
meritorious writer.His allusion to Plato, his reflections on the Last
Judgment, his animated address to youth, and his conclusion of his
sixteenth lecture, must strike deep into the heart of every reader.His
"Sermons preached to a Country Congregation," prove him a pious,
charitable, and valuable man.[96]

The glowing imagery of his style, when viewing the beautiful scenery in
many parts of England, and some of the vast and magnificent ones of
Scotland, is fraught with many fervid charms.Mathias, in the remonstrance he so justly makes as to the
jargonic conceit of some of his language.Gilpin's first work on
picturesque beauty, was his Observations on the River Wye, made in the
year 1770.He afterwards published:

Forest Scenery--Picturesque Beauties of the Highlands--Mountains of
Cumberland and Westmoreland--Western parts of England--Cambridge,
Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex--Hampshire, Sussex and Kent.Three Essays, on
Picturesque Beauty, on Picturesque Travel, and on Sketching Landscape,
to which is added, a poem on Landscape Painting.A full account of his
numerous works may be seen in Watts's Bibl.A complete list of
them is also given by Mr.i. of his Illustrations, with
a brief memoir.Johnson also gives a list of such of his works as
relate to picturesque scenery, with their titles at large.His portrait
was painted by Walton, and engraved in metz by Clint.JAMES ANDERSON published the following works; and I have given the price
of such of them as appeared in the late Mr.Harding's Agricultural
Catalogue:--

     1.The Bee, or Literary Intelligencer, 18 vols.Recreations in Agriculture, Natural History, Arts and
     Miscellaneous Literature, 6 vols._Lond._ 3_l._ 10s.Essays relating to Agriculture and Rural Affairs, 3 vols.Practical Treatise on draining Bogs, 8vo.Practical Treatise on Peat Moss, 8vo.On Lime as a Cement and Manure, 8vo.An Account of the different kinds of Sheep found in the Russian
     Dominions, and amongst the Tartar Hordes, 8vo.Investigation of the Causes of Scarcity of 1800.Miscellaneous Thoughts on Planting Timber Trees, chiefly for the
     climate of Scotland, by Agricola, 8vo.Description of a Patent Hot-house, 1804.In "Public Characters of 1800 and 1801," a portrait is given of him, a
list of his works, and it thus speaks of him: "The manners of this
ingenious and very useful man were plain and frank, an indication of an
honest and good heart.He was benevolent and generous, a tender parent,
and a warm friend, and very highly respected in the circle of his
acquaintance."There is a portrait of him, painted by Anderson, and
engraved by Ridley.A copy is given in the Mirror, (published by Vernon
and Hood), of Nov.He died at West Ham, Essex, in 1808, aged 69.Lysons, in the
Supplement to his Environs of London, gives a few particulars of him.He was the youngest son of Sir Robert Walpole, who so
long guided the destinies of England, and whose attractive and
benevolent private life, seems to have fully merited the praise of
Pope's elegant muse:

   _Seen him I have; but in his happier hour
   Of social pleasure,--ill exchang'd for power--
   Seen him uncumber'd with the venal tribe,
   Smile without art, and win without a bribe._

The best portraits of this intelligent and acute writer, Horace Walpole,
are the portrait in Mr.Dallaway's richly decorated edition of the
Anecdotes of Painting, from Sir Joshua Reynolds, and that in Mr.Cadell's Contemporary Portraits, from Lawrence.Another portrait is prefixed to the ninth volume of his works, in 4to.1825, from a picture in the possession of the Marquis of Hertford.There
is another portrait, engraved by Pariset, from Falconot.Walpole
died in March, 1797, at his favourite seat at Strawberry-hill, at the
age of eighty.His manners were highly polished, from his having, during
the course of a long life, frequented the first societies.His
conversation abounded with interesting anecdote and playful wit.Felicity of narration, and liveliness of expression, mark his graceful
pen.The Prince de Ligne (a perfect judge) thus speaks of his _History
of the Modern Taste in Gardening_:--"Je n'en admire pas moins
l'eloquence, et la profondeur, de son ouvrage sur les jardins."Walpole himself says:--"We have given the true model of gardening to the
world: let other countries mimic or corrupt our taste; but let it reign
here on its verdant throne, original by its elegant simplicity, and
proud of no other art than that of softening nature's harshnesses, and
copying her graceful touch."18 of his Essays, pays high respect to Mr.Walpole, and differs from him "with great deference and reluctance."He
observes:--"I can hardly think it necessary to make any excuse for
calling Lord Orford, Mr.Walpole; it is the name by which he is best
known in the literary world, and to which his writings have given a
celebrity much beyond what any hereditary honour can bestow."Johnson observes:--"To his sketch of the improvements introduced by
Bridgman and Kent, and those garden artists, their immediate successors,
we may afford the best praise; he appears to be a faithful, and is, an
eloquent annalist."It is impossible to pass by this tribute, without
reminding my reader, that Mr.Johnson's own review of our ornamental
gardening, is energetic and luminous; as is indeed the whole of his
comprehensive general review of gardening, from the earliest period,
down to the close of the last century.He devoted himself to literary pursuits; was
a profound antiquary, and a truly worthy man.He died in 1800, aged 73,
at his chambers in the Temple, and was buried in the Temple church.The
attractive improvements in the gardens there, may be said to have
originated with him.He possibly looked on them as classic ground; for
in these gardens, the proud Somerset vowed to dye their white rose to a
bloody red, and Warwick prophesied that their brawl

                          ----in the Temple garden,
   Shall send, between the red rose and the white,
   A thousand souls to death and deadly night.He published,

     1.Observations on the more Ancient Statutes, 4to.To the 5th
     edition of which, in 1796, is prefixed his portrait.A translation of Orosius, ascribed to Alfred, with notes, 8vo.Tracts on the probability of reaching the North Pole, 4to.of the Archaeologia, is his paper On the Progress of
     Gardening.It was printed as a separate tract by Mr.Nichols, price
     1s.Miscellanies on various subjects, 4to.Nichols, in his Life of Bowyer, calls him "a man of amiable
character, polite, communicative and liberal;" and in the fifth volume
of his Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century,
he gives a neatly engraved portrait of Mr.Barrington, and some
memorials or letters of his.Boswell ("the cheerful, the pleasant,
the inimitable biographer of his illustrious friend"), thus relates Dr.Barrington:--"Soon after he
had published his excellent Observations on the Statutes, Johnson
waited on that worthy and learned gentleman, and having told him his
name, courteously said, 'I have read your book, Sir, with great
pleasure, and wish to be better known to you.'Thus began an
acquaintance which was continued with mutual regard as long as Johnson
lived."the learned author of Philological Enquiries,
thus speaks of Mr.Barrington's Observations on the Statutes:--"a
valuable work, concerning which it is difficult to decide, whether it is
more entertaining or more instructive."JOSEPH CRADOCK, Esq.whose "Village Memoirs" display his fine taste in
landscape gardening.This feeling and generous-minded man, whose gentle
manners, polite learning, and excellent talents, entitled him to an
acquaintance with the first characters of the age, died in 1826, at the
great age of eighty-five.This classical scholar and polished gentleman,
who had (as a correspondent observes in the Gentleman's Magazine for
January, 1827) "the habit of enlivening and embellishing every thing
which he said with a certain lightning of eye and honied tone of voice,"
shone in the first literary circles, and ranked as his intimate and
valued friends (among many other enlightened persons), David Garrick,
and Warburton, Hurd, Johnson, Goldsmith, Percy, and Parr.Johnson
called him "a very pleasing gentleman."Indeed, he appears from every
account to have been in all respects an amiable and accomplished person.He had the honour of being selected to dance a minuet with the most
graceful of all dancers, Mrs.Garrick, at the Stratford Jubilee.Farmer addressed his unanswerable Essay on the
Learning of Shakspeare.In acts of humanity and kindness, he was
surpassed by few.Pope's line of _the gay conscience of a life well
spent_, might well have been applied to Mr.When in
Leicestershire, "he was respected by people of all parties for his
worth, and idolized by the poor for his benevolence."This honest and
honourable man, depicted his own mind in the concluding part of his
inscription, for the banks of the lake he formed in his romantic and
picturesque grounds, in that county:--

   _Here on the bank Pomona's blossoms glow,
   And finny myriads sparkle from below;
   Here let the mind at peaceful anchor rest,
   And heaven's own sunshine cheer the guiltless breast._[97]

In 1773 he partly took his "Zobeide" from an unfinished tragedy by
Voltaire.On sending a copy to Ferney, the enlightened veteran thus
concluded his answer: "You have done too much honour to an old sick man
of eighty.I am, with the most sincere esteem and gratitude,

   "Sir, your obedient servant,
   "VOLTAIRE."[98]

I cannot refrain from adding a short extract from the above quoted
magazine, as it brings to one's memory another much esteemed and worthy
man:--"Here, perhaps, it may be allowable to allude to the sincere
attachment between Mr.Cradock, and his old friend Mr.Cradock an
annual visit at Gumley Hall; but on Mr.Cradock settling in London, the
intercourse became incessant, and we doubt not that the daily
correspondence which took place between them, contributed to cheer the
latter days of these two veterans in literature.They had both of them
in early life enjoyed the flattering distinction of an intimacy with the
same eminent characters; and to hear the different anecdotes elicited in
their animated conversations respecting Johnson and others, was indeed
an intellectual treat of no ordinary description.Nichols possessed a similarity in taste and judgment.They were both
endowed with peculiar quickness of comprehension, and with powers and
accuracy of memory rarely equalled."One may say of the liberal minded
Mr.Johnson, that his love of
literature was a passion that stuck to his last stand.Cradock have, since his decease, been published by Mr.J. B. Nichols, in
4 vols.They contain his Essay on Gardening and Village Memoirs.They are enriched by a miniature portrait of him, by Hone, in 1764, when
Mr.Cradock was in his prime of life, in his twenty-second year, and
when his piercing eyes and intelligent countenance, were thought to have
resembled those of Mr.Cradock, taken of him only a month before his decease.In the above
quoted magazine, is a copy of this profile, with a memoir.SIR JOSEPH BANKS.There is a fine portrait of him by Russel, engraved by
Collyer.Cadell's Contemporary Portraits is another fine one,
from the pencil of Lawrence.His portrait is preserved by the
Horticultural Society of London, and in the British Museum is his bust,
chiselled and presented by the Hon.A good copy of the
engraving by Collyer is in the European Magazine for Feb.1795, and
from the memoir there given I select the following:

"If to support the dignity of the first literary society in the world,
and by firmness and candour to conciliate the regard of its members; if
rejecting the allurements of dissipation, to explore sciences unknown,
and to cultivate the most manly qualities of the human heart; if to
dispense a princely fortune in the enlargement of science, the
encouragement of genius, and the alleviation of distress, be
circumstances which entitle any one to a more than ordinary share of
respect, few will dispute the claim of the person whose portrait
ornaments the present magazine.... In short, he is entitled to every
praise that science, liberality, and intelligence can bestow on their
most distinguished favourites."Pulteney, in his handsome dedication of his Sketches on the progress
of Botany, to Sir Joseph, thus alludes to his voyage with Cook:--"To
whom could a work of this nature with so much propriety be addressed, as
to him who had not only relinquished, for a series of years, all the
allurements that a polished nation could display to opulence; but had
exposed himself to numberless perils, and the repeated risk of life
itself, that he might attain higher degrees of that knowledge, which
these sketches are intended to communicate."The Academy of Sciences at Dijon, in their "Notice sur Sir Jos.Banks,"
thus apostrophizes his memory:--"Ombre de Banks!apparois en ce lieu
consacre au culte des sciences et des lettres; viens occuper la place
que t'y conservent les muses, accepter les couronnes qu'elles-memes
t'ont tressees!viens recevoir le tribut de nos sentimens, temoignage
sincere de notre douleur et de not regrets; et par le souvenir de tes
vertus, viens enflammer nos coeurs de cet amour pour le bien, qui fut
le mobile de toutes tes actions!Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, justly calls him "This
universal patron of the arts and sciences.Natural history was the
favourite of his scientific studies, and every part of it was enriched
by his researches."He again hails him as "a munificent friend of
science and literature."The name of Banks will always be associated
with that of Solander, the favourite pupil of Linnaeus, and with that of
the immortal Cook.De Lille closes his _Jardins_ with a most generous
and animated invocation to the memory of this intrepid navigator.The portrait of this eminent physician of Bath, is
engraved by Fitler, from a painting by Daniel, of Bath, in 1791.It is
prefixed to his "Influence of the Passions upon Disorders."He died in
August, 1824, at the age of eighty-one.He published,

     1.Essay on the Preservation of the Health of Persons employed in
     Agriculture, 1s.Miscellaneous Tracts relating to Natural History; selected from
     the principal writers of antiquity.Remarks on the Influence of Climate, Situation, Nature of
     Country, &c. The Encyclop.of Gardening calls this "a most
     interesting work."says "it
     displays an almost unlimited extent of learning and research."An Historical View of the Taste for Gardening and Laying out
     Grounds among the Nations of Antiquity._Dilly._

A list of his other works (nearly twenty in number), may be seen in the
Dictionary of Living Authors, or in vol.;
which last work says that the late Lord Thurlow, at whose table he was
almost a constant guest, declared that "he never saw such a man; that he
knew every thing, and knew it better than any one else."Falconer's Historical View of the Taste for Gardening.This honest, much-esteemed, and inoffensive man, though
so deservedly eminent as a botanist, published only the following work
on horticulture:--"Directions for Cultivating the Crambe Maritima, or
Sea-kale for the Use of the Table."A new edition, enlarged, with three
engravings.Loudon says, that this pamphlet has done more to
recommend the culture of _sea-kale_ and diffuse the knowledge of it,
than all his predecessors.Nearly three pages of the Encyclopaedia are
enriched with the result of all that has appeared on the cultivation of
this vegetable by English, Scotch, or French writers.Curtis have long been held in high esteem.The first number of his Flora Londinensis appeared in 1777.He commenced
his Botanical Magazine in 1787.His Observations on British Grasses,
appeared in a second edition, with coloured plates, in 1790.His
Lectures were published after his death, to which is prefixed his
portrait.He died
in 1799, was buried in Battersea church-yard, and on his grave-stone
these lines are inscribed:--

   _While living herbs shall spring profusely wild,
     Or gardens cherish all that's sweet and gay,
   So long thy works shall please, dear nature's child,
     So long thy memory suffer no decay._


THOMAS MARTYN, Professor of Botany at Cambridge, whose striking
portrait, from a picture by Russel, appears in Dr.Thornton's superb
work on botany.He died in June, 1825, in the ninetieth year of his age.His edition of Miller's Gardener's Dictionary, appeared in 4 vols.Johnson observes, that this work "requires no comment.It is
a standard, practical work, never to be surpassed."Martyn also
published _Flora Rustica_, a description of plants, useful or injurious
in husbandry, _with coloured plates_, 4 vols.There are portraits of him by Sir J. Reynolds, engraved
by Collyer and by Green; one by Cotes, engraved by Houston, in 1772; and
a profile by Pariset, after a drawing by Falconot.He died in 1796, aged
sixty-nine.He published,

     1.Plans and Views of the Buildings and Gardens at Kew.A Dissertation on Oriental Gardening, second edition, with
     additions.To which is annexed an Explanatory Discourse, 4to.This work gave rise to those smart satires, _An Heroic
     Epistle_, and _An Heroic Postscript_.HUMPHREY REPTON, Esq.His portrait is prefixed to his Observations on
the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, folio.He also
published on this subject:

     1.Sketches and Hints on Landscape Gardening, folio, 1795.Enquiry into the Changes in Landscape Gardening, 8vo.On the Introduction of Indian Architecture and Gardening, folio,
     1808.A charming little
     essay inserted in the _Linn.Fragments on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening,
     4to.of Gardening, is some general
     information respecting Mr.WILLIAM FORSYTH, Esq.His portrait is prefixed to the seventh edition of
his Treatise on the Culture and Management of Fruit Trees, 8vo.1824;
also to the 4to.He also published
Observations on the diseases, defects, and injuries in all kinds of
Fruit and Forest Trees, with an account of a particular method of cure,
8vo.JAMES DICKSON, who established the well-known seed and herb shop in
Covent-garden, and died at the age of eighty-six, a few years ago,
appears to have been very much esteemed.His family at Croydon possess
his portrait, and there is another preserved by the Horticultural
Society.He married for his second wife a sister of the intrepid
traveller Mungo Park.Dickson, when searching for plants in the
Hebrides, in 1789, was accompanied by him.Handsome mention is made of
Mr.Dickson in the Life of Mungo Park, prefixed to the "Journal of a
Mission to the Interior of Africa."In the above life, the friendly and
generous assistance which Sir Joseph Banks shewed both to Mr.Dickson,
and to Mungo Park, is very pleasingly recorded.Dickson
is given in the 5th vol.He published,
Fasciculus Plantarum Cryptog.RICHARD PAYNE KNIGHT, Esq.author of The Landscape, a didactic poem,
4to.A second edition, _with a preface_, appeared in 4to.Knight, on the subject of
landscape scenery, except his occasional allusions thereto, in his
Analytical Enquiry into the Principles of Taste, the second edition of
which appeared in 8vo.This latter work embraces a variety of
subjects, and contains many energetic pages, particularly those on
Homer, and on the English drama.His philosophical survey of human life
"in its last stages," (at p.461), and where he alludes to "the hooks
and links which hold the affections of age," is worthy of all praise; it
is deep, solemn, and affecting.The other publications of this gentleman
are enumerated in Dr.Knight, in his Landscape,
after invoking the genius of Virgil, in reference to his

   _----O qui me gelidis in vallibus Hoemi
   Sistat, et ingenti ramorum protegat unbra,_

thus proceeds, after severely censuring Mr._Browne_, who

   ----bade the stream 'twixt banks close shaved to glide;
   Banish'd the thickets of high-bowering wood,
   Which hung, reflected o'er the glassy flood:
   Where screen'd and shelter'd from the heats of day,
   Oft on the moss-grown stone reposed I lay,
   And tranquil view'd the limpid stream below,
   Brown with o'er hanging shade, in circling eddies flow.Dear peaceful scenes, that now prevail no more,
   Your loss shall every weeping muse deplore!Your poet, too, in one dear favour'd spot,
   Shall shew your beauties are not quite forgot:
   Protect from all the sacrilegious waste
   Of false improvement, and pretended taste,
   _One tranquil vale!_[100] where oft, from care retir'd
   He courts the muse, and thinks himself inspired;
   Lulls busy thought, and rising hope to rest,
   And checks each wish that dares his peace molest.After scorning "wisdom's solemn empty toys," he proceeds:

     Let me, retir'd from business, toil, and strife,
   Close amidst books and solitude my life;
   Beneath yon high-brow'd rocks in thickets rove,
   Or, meditating, wander through the grove;
   Or, from the cavern, view the noontide beam
   Dance on the rippling of the lucid stream,
   While the wild woodbine dangles o'er my head,
   And various flowers around their fragrance spread.*       *       *       *       *

   Then homeward as I sauntering move along,
   The nightingale begins his evening song;
   Chanting a requiem to departed light,
   That smooths the raven down of sable night.After an animated tribute to _Homer_, he reviews the rising and the
slumbering, or drooping of the arts, midst storms of war, and gloomy
bigotry.Hail, arts divine!--still may your solace sweet
   Cheer the recesses of my calm retreat;
   And banish every mean pursuit, that dares
   Cloud life's serene with low ambitious cares.Vain is the pomp of wealth: its splendid halls,
   And vaulted roofs, sustain'd by marble walls.--
   In beds of state pale sorrow often sighs,
   Nor gets relief from gilded canopies:
   But arts can still new recreation find,
   To soothe the troubles of th' afflicted mind;
   Recall the ideal work of ancient days,
   And man in his own estimation raise;
   Visions of glory to his eyes impart,
   And cheer with conscious pride his drooping heart.After a review of our several timber trees, and a tribute to our native
streams, and woods; and after describing in happy lines _Kamtschatka's_
dreary coast, he concludes his poem with reflections on the ill-fated
_Queen of France_, whose

   Waning beauty, in the dungeon's gloom,
   Feels, yet alive, the horrors of the tomb!Knight's portrait, painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence, is preserved at
Downton Castle, near Ludlow; and is engraved among Cadell's Contemporary
Portraits.It is also engraved by Bromley, from the same painter.Another portrait was in the library of the late Mr.He died at Edinburgh in June 1828, at the great age
of eighty-four.His portrait was drawn by Raiburn, and engraved by
Mitchell.He was a contemporary of several eminent persons, whose
society and friendship formed one of the chief pleasures of his life.There was scarcely an institution proposed for the benefit of his native
city, Edinburgh, to which his name will not be found a contributor.He
was, in fact, the patron and benefactor of all public charities.In 1809
he projected, and by his exertions, succeeded in establishing, the
Horticultural Society of Edinburgh.His animated and scientific
discourses, delivered at the meetings of the Caledonian Horticultural
Society, will always be perused with eager pleasure by every
horticulturist.In that delivered in December, 1814, and inserted in the
fifth number of their Memoirs, this zealous well-wisher of his native
city, thus exults:--"I am now, gentlemen, past the seventieth year of my
age, and I have been a steady admirer both of Flora and Pomona from the
very earliest period of my youth.During a pretty long life, it has been
my lot to have had opportunities of visiting gardens in three different
quarters of the globe, in Europe, in Asia, and in Africa; and from what
I have seen, I am decidedly of opinion, that at the present day, there
is not a large city in the world, which enjoys a supply of vegetable
food in more abundance, in greater variety, or in higher excellence,
than the city of Edinburgh.From the potatoe to the pine-apple,--from
the most useful to the most delicious productions of the vegetable
kingdom, we are not at present outdone, as far as my observation goes,
by any large city on the face of the earth."His medical talents may
well be believed not to have been small, when it is told, that he was
the rival in practice, and by no means an unsuccessful one, of the
illustrious Cullen, of the Monros, and of Gregory.Duncan was eminently distinguished for his sociality, and the desire to
benefit all mankind.His
favourite amusement was _gardening_.He possessed a garden in the
neighbourhood of Edinburgh, which he cultivated entirely with his own
hands, and on the door of which was placed, in conspicuous letters,
'_hinc salus_.'He was particularly kind to the students attending his
lectures, and gave a tea-drinking every Sunday evening to about a dozen
of them, by rotation, who assembled at six o'clock and went away at
eight.When old, he used sometimes to forget the lapse of time, and in
his lectures, frequently spoke about the _late_ Mr.Haller, who lived a
century before.To the last year of his life he never omitted going up,
on the morning of the 1st of May, to wash his face in the dew of the
summit of a mountain near Edinburgh, called Arthur's Seat.He had the
merit of being the father of the present Dr.Duncan, the celebrated
author of the Edinburgh Dispensatory, and professor of materia medica.Duncan's funeral was properly made a public one, at which the
professors, magistrates, and medical bodies of Edinburgh attended, to
testify their sorrow and respect.His portrait was taken by Sir Thomas Lawrence, and is
now at Foxley.[101] The Hereford Journal of Wednesday, September 16,
1829, thus relates his decease:--"On Monday last died, at Foxley, in
this county, Sir Uvedale Price, Bart.in the eighty-third year of his
age.The obituary of 1829 will not record a name more gifted or more
dear!In a county where he was one of the oldest, as well as one of the
most constant of its inhabitants, it were superfluous to enumerate his
many claims to distinction and regret.His learning, his sagacity, his
exquisite taste, his indefatigable ardour, would have raised to eminence
a man much less conspicuous by his station in life, by his
correspondence with the principal literati of Europe, and by the
attraction and polish of his conversation and manners.Possessing his
admirable faculties to so venerable an age, we must deplore that a
gentleman who conferred such honour on our county is removed from that
learned retirement in which he delighted, and from that enchanting scene
which, in every sense, he so greatly adorned.He is succeeded in his
title by his only son, now Sir Robert Price, one of our
representatives."Sir Uvedale published the following:

     1.An Essay on the Picturesque, as compared with the Sublime and
     Beautiful, and on the use of studying pictures for the purpose of
     improving real landscape, 8vo.This volume was afterwards
     published in 1796, in 8vo.with _considerable additions_, and in
     1798 was published at _Hereford_ a second volume, being an Essay on
     Artificial Water, an Essay on Decorations near the House, and an
     Essay on Architecture and Buildings as connected with Scenery.A Letter to H. Repton, Esq.on the application of the practice
     and principles of Landscape Painting to Landscape Gardening.Intended as a supplement to the Essays.Second edition,
     _Hereford_, 1798, 8vo.This is a sportive display of pleasant wit,
     polished learning, and deep admiration of the great landscape
     painters.Keen as some of his pages are, and lamenting that there
     should have been any controversy ("or tilting at each other's
     breasts,") on the subject of Launcelot Browne's works, "I trust,
     (says he,) however, that my friends will vouch for me, that
     whatever sharpness there may be in my style, there is no rancour in
     my heart."Repton in his Enquiry into the Changes of Landscape
     Gardening, acknowledges "the elegant and gentleman-like manner in
     which Mr.Indeed, many pages in
     this present letter shew this.A Dialogue on the distinct Characters of the Picturesque and the
     Beautiful, in answer to the objections of Mr.Knight, 1801,
     8vo.[102]

A general review of Sir Uvedale's ideas on this subject, is candidly
given by Mr.after a mature study of
_all_ the modern writers who have endeavoured to form "a taste for the
harmony and connection of natural scenery."Loudon farther calls him
"the great reformer of landscape gardening."We have to regret, that though so many springs must have cheered the
long life of Sir Uvedale Price, (and which he calls the _dolce prima
vera, gioventu dell'anno_, and whose blossoms, flowers, and
"profusion of fresh, gay, and beautiful colours and sweets," he so
warmly dwelt on in many of his pages,) and though the number of these
springs must have nearly equalled those which gilded the days of Lord
Kames, of the honourable Horace Walpole, of Mr.Gilpin, and of Joseph
Cradock, Esq.yet we have to regret that his classic pen has presented
to the public no other efforts of his genius and cultivated taste, than
the few respectable ones above stated.Had he chose to have indulged his
own powers in describing what has been done towards "embellishing the
face of this noble kingdom," (to quote his own words,) we might have
perused descriptive pages equal to his own critical and refined review
of Blenheim, or of Powis Castle, and of a character as high and pure, as
those of Thomas Whateley.In proof of this, we need only refer to many
pages in his Essays,--not only when he so well paints the charms of
sequestered nature, whether in its deep recesses, _o'er canopied with
luscious eglantine_,--in the "modest and retired character of a
brook,"--the rural simplicity of a cottage, with its lilacs and fruit
trees, its rustic porch, covered with vine or ivy, but when he dwells on
the ruins and on "the religious calm" of our abbeys,[103] or on our old
mansion-houses, with their terraces, their summer-houses covered with
ivy, and mixed with wild vegetation.And we need farther only to refer
to those feeling pages in his second volume, where he laments that his
own youth and inexperience should (in order to follow the silly folly of
_being in the fashion_,) have doomed to sudden and total destruction an
old paternal garden, with all its embellishments, and whose destruction
revives in these pages all the emotions of his youth; and he concludes
these pages of regret, by candidly confessing, that he gained little but
"much difficulty, expence and dirt," and that he thus detains his
readers in relating what so personally concerns himself, "because there
is nothing so useful to others, however humiliating to ourselves, as
the frank confession of our errors and of their causes.No man can
equally with the person who committed them, impress upon others the
extent of the mischief done, and the regret that follows it."It is
painful to quit pages so interesting as those that immediately follow
this quotation.[104]

There are few objects that the enlightened mind of Sir Uvedale has not
remarked.Take the following as an instance:

"Nothing is so captivating, or seems so much to accord with our ideas of
beauty, as the smiles of a beautiful countenance; yet they have
sometimes a striking mixture of the other character.Of this kind are
those smiles which break out suddenly from a serious, sometimes from
almost a severe countenance, and which, when that gleam is over, leave
no trace of it behind--

   _Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
   That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth,
   And e'er a man has time to say, behold!The jaws of darkness do devour it up._

There is another smile, which seems in the same degree to accord with
the ideas of beauty only: it is that smile which proceeds from a mind
full of sweetness and sensibility, and which, when it is over, still
leaves on the countenance its mild and amiable impression; as after the
sun is set, the mild glow of his rays is still diffused over every
object.This smile, with the glow that accompanies it, is beautifully
painted by Milton, as most becoming an inhabitant of heaven:

   To whom the angel, with a smile that glow'd
   Celestial rosy red, love's proper hue,
   Thus answered."The great object in the above Essays, is to improve the laying out of
grounds by studying the productions "of those great artists _who have
most diligently studied the beauties of nature_.On this subject he has
in these volumes poured forth the effusions of his richly gifted mind,
in his contemplation of the works of those really great painters, whose
landscape scenery, from the most rural to the grandest, "have been
consecrated by long uninterrupted admiration."Instead of the narrow,
mechanical practice of a few English gardeners, or layers-out of
grounds, he wishes "the noble and varied works of the eminent painters
of every age, and of every country, and those of _their_ supreme
mistress NATURE, should be the great models of imitation."[105] He has
supported many of his opinions or observations, or embellished or
enlivened them, by acute allusions, not only to Milton but to
Shakspeare, whom he calls "that most original creator, and most accurate
observer."[106]

He has depicted his own mind in p.378 of the first volume of his
Essays; for after lamenting that despotic system of improvement which
demands all to be laid open,--all that obstructs to be levelled to the
ground,--houses, orchards, gardens, all swept away,--nothing tending to
humanize the mind--and that a despot thinks every person an intruder who
enters his domain, wishing to destroy cottages and pathways, and to
reign alone, he thus proceeds:--"Here I cannot resist paying a tribute
to the memory of a beloved uncle, and recording a benevolence towards
all the inhabitants around him, that struck me from my earliest
remembrance; and it is an impression I wish always to cherish.It seemed
as if he had made his extensive walks as much for them as for himself;
they used them as freely, and their enjoyment was his.The village bore
as strong marks of his and of his brother's attentions (for in that
respect they appeared to have but one mind), to the comforts and
pleasures of its inhabitants.Such attentive kindnesses, are amply
repaid by affectionate regard and reverence; and were they general
throughout the kingdom, they would do much more towards guarding us
against democratical opinions

   _Than twenty thousand soldiers, arm'd in proof._

The cheerfulness of the scene I have mentioned, and all the interesting
circumstances attending it, (so different from those of solitary
grandeur,) have convinced me, that he who destroys dwellings, gardens
and inclosures, for the sake of mere extent, and parade of property,
only extends the bounds of monotony, and of dreary, selfish pride; but
contrasts those of vanity, amusement and humanity."One may trace, too, his feeling mind towards the conclusion of his
second volume, where, after many pleasing pages on the rural scenery of
cottages, and in hamlets and villages, ("where a lover of humanity may
find so many sources of amusement and interest,") and on the means of
embellishing them, "I could wish (says he) to turn the minds of
improvers from too much attachment to solitary parade, towards objects
more connected with general habitation and embellishment;... and it may
be truly said, that there is no way in which wealth can produce such
natural unaffected variety, and such interest, as by adorning a real
village, and promoting the comforts and enjoyments of its inhabitants._Goldsmith_ has most feelingly described (more, I trust, from the warmth
of a poetical imagination and quick sensibility than from real fact),
the ravages of wealthy pride.My aim is to shew, that they are no less
hostile to real taste, than to humanity; and should I succeed, it is
possible that those, whom all the affecting images and pathetic touches
of Goldsmith would not have restrained from destroying a village, may
even be induced to build one, in order to shew their taste in the
decoration and disposition of village-houses and cottages."After many
traces of village scenery, he thus proceeds: "The church, together with
the church-yard, is, on various accounts, an interesting object to the
villagers of every age and disposition; to the old and serious, as a
spot consecrated to the purposes of religion, where the living christian
performs his devotions, and where, after his death, his body is
deposited near those of his ancestors and departed friends, and
relations: to the young and thoughtless, as a place where, on the day of
rest from labour, they meet each other in their holiday clothes; and
also (what forms a singular contrast with tombs and grave-stones), as
the place which at their wakes, is the chief scene of their gaiety and
rural sports."After speaking of the yew, which from the solemnity of
its foliage, is most suited to church-yards, being as much consecrated
to the dead as the cypress among the ancients, he says that "there seems
to be no reason, why in the more southern parts of England, cypresses
should not be mixed with yews, or why cedars of Libanus, which are
perfectly hardy, and of a much quicker growth than yews, should not be
introduced.In high romantic situations, particularly, where the
church-yard is elevated above the general level, a cedar, spreading his
branches downwards from that height, would have the most picturesque,
and at the same time, the most solemn effect."Johnson's lately published History of
English Gardening, to add a very early tract on that subject, and I take
the liberty of transcribing his exact words: "A Boke of Husbandry,
London, 4to.This little work is very rare, being one of the productions
from the press of Wynkin de Worde.It consists of but twelve leaves, and
is without date, but certainly was not of a later year than 1500.'Here begyneth a treatyse of
Husbandry which Mayster Groshede somtyme Bysshop of Lyncoln made, and
translated it out of Frensshe into Englyshe, whiche techeth all maner of
men to governe theyr londes, tenementes, and demesnes ordinately.''Here endeth the Boke of Husbandry, _and of Plantynge, and Graffynge of
Trees and Vynes_.'"Nichols printed the Life of Robert
_Grosseteste_, the celebrated Bishop of Lincoln.With an Account of the Bishop's _Works_, &c. Illustrated with plates of
his Tomb, Ring, and Crosier.Page 17.--I have in this page alluded to the hard fate of Correggio.That my reader may know who he was, let him inspect those pages in vol.i. of Sir U. Price's Essays, where he thus concludes a critique on his
genius: "I believe that if a variety of persons, conversant in painting,
were asked what pictures (taking every circumstance together) appeared
to them most beautiful, and had left the softest and most pleasing
impression,--the majority would fix upon Correggio."Lawson, in the dedication to his New Orchard and Garden,
gives the name of an author on gardening, whose book I have not met
with.He dedicates it "to the right worshipfull _Sir Henry Belosses_,"
and he acknowledges, "1st.the many courtesies you have vouchsaved me.your delightfull skill in matters of this nature.the profit
which I received from your _learned discourse of Fruit-trees_.your animating and assisting of others to such endeavours.Last of all,
the rare worke of your owne in this kind, all which to publish under
your protection, I have adventured as you see."From this it would
appear, that this "learned discourse" is transfused into the New Orchard
and Garden.After all, perhaps, this "learned discourse" was merely in
conversation.At all events, it has recorded the name of Sir Henry as
warmly devoted to orcharding, or to horticulture.W. Lawson, in his
preface, dwells upon the praises of this art, "how some, and not a few
of the best, have accounted it a chiefe part of earthly happinesse to
have faire and pleasant orchards--how ancient, how profitable, how
pleasant it is."His fourteenth chapter is On the Age of Fruit-trees.After stating that some "shall dure 1000 years," and the age of many of
the apple-trees in his little orchard, he says: "If my trees be 100
yeares old, and yet want 200 of their growth before they leave
increasing, which make 300, then we must needs resolve, that this 300
yeere are but the third part of a tree's life, because (as all things
living besides) so trees must have allowed them for their increase one
third, another third for their stand, and a third part of time also for
their decay."--"So that I resolve upon good reason, that Fruit-trees
well ordered, may live and live 1000 yeeres, and beare fruit, and the
longer, the more, the greater, and the better, because his vigour is
proud and stronger, when his yeeres are many.You shall see old trees
put their buds and blossoms both sooner and more plentifully than young
trees by much.And I sensibly perceive my young trees to inlarge their
fruit, as they grow greater, both for number, and greatnesse."--"And if
Fruit-trees last to this age, how many ages is it to be supposed, strong
and huge Timber-trees will last?whose huge bodies require the yeeres of
divers _Methushalaes_, before they end their days; whose sap is strong
and better, whose barke is hard and thicke, and their substance solid
and stiffe: all which are defences of health and long life.Their
strength withstands all forcible winds."His seventeenth chapter is on
the Ornaments of an Orchard.I here give the whole of that chapter:


"Me thinks hitherto we haue but a bare Orchard for fruit, and but halfe
good, so long as it wants those comely ornaments, that should giue
beauty to all our labours, and make much for the honest delight of the
owner and his friends."For it is not to be doubted: but as God hath giuen man things
profitable, so hath he allowed him honest comfort, delight, and
recreation in all the workes of his hands.Nay, all his labours vnder
the sunne without this are troubles, and vexation of mind: For what is
greedy gaine, without delight, but moyling, and turmoyling slauery?But
comfortable delight, with content, is the good of euery thing, and the
patterne of heauen.A morsell of bread with comfort, is better by much
than a fat oxe with vnquietnesse.And who can deny, but the principall
end of an Orchard, is the honest delight of one wearied with the works
of his lawfull calling?The very workes of and in an Orchard and Garden,
are better than the ease and rest of and from other labours.When God
had made man after his owne image, in a perfect state, and would haue
him to represent himselfe in authority, tranquillity and pleasure vpon
the earth, he placed him in Paradise.but a Garden
and Orchard of trees and hearbs, full of pleasure?The gods of the earth, resembling the great God of heauen in
authority, maiestie, and abundance of all things, wherein is their most
delight?and whither doe they withdraw themselues from the troublesome
affaires of their estate, being tyred with the hearing and iudging of
litigious Controuersies?choked (as it were) with the close ayres of
their sumptuous buildings, their stomacks cloyed with variety of
Banquets, their eares filled and ouerburthened with tedious
discoursings?but into their Orchards, made and prepared,
dressed and destinated for that purpose, to renue and refresh their
sences, and to call home their ouer-wearied spirits.Nay, it is (no
doubt) a comfort to them, to set open their cazements into a most
delicate Garden and Orchard, whereby they may not onely see that,
wherein they are so much delighted, but also to giue fresh, sweet, and
pleasant ayre to their galleries and chambers."And looke, what these men do by reason of their greatnes and ability,
prouoked with delight, the same doubtlesse would euery of vs doe, if
power were answerable to our desires, whereby we shew manifestly, that
of all other delights on earth, they that are taken by Orchards, are
most excellent, and most agreeing with nature."For whereas euery other pleasure commonly filles some one of our
sences, and that onely, with delight, this makes all our sences swimme
in pleasure, and that with infinite variety, ioyned with no less
commodity."That famous philosopher, and matchlesse orator, M. T. C. prescribeth
nothing more fit, to take away the tediousnesse and heauy load of three
or foure score yeeres, than the pleasure of an Orchard."What can your eyes desire to see, your ears to hear, your mouth to
tast, or your nose to smell, that is not to be had in an Orchard, with
abundance and variety?What more delightsome than an infinite variety of
sweet smelling flowers?decking with sundry colours, the greene mantle
of the earth, vniuersall mother of vs all, so by them bespotted, so
dyed, that all the world cannot sample them, and wherein it is more fit
to admire the Dyer, than imitate his workemanship.Colouring not onely
the earth, but decking the ayre, and sweetning euery breath and spirit."The rose red, damaske, veluet, and double double prouince rose, the
sweet muske rose, double and single, the double and single white rose.The faire and sweet senting Woodbinde, double and single, and double
double.Purple cowslips, and double cowslips, and double double
cowslips.The violet nothing behinde the
best, for smelling sweetly.A thousand more will prouoke your content."And all these, by the skill of your gardner, so comely, and orderly
placed in your borders and squares, and so intermingled, that none
looking thereon, cannot but wonder, to see, what Nature corrected by Art
can doe."When you behold in diuers corners of your Orchard Mounts of stone, or
wood curiously wrought within and without, or of earth couered with
fruit-trees: Kentish cherry, damsons, plummes, &c. with staires of
precious workmanship.And in some corner (or moe) a true dyall or
Clocke, and some anticke workes, and especially siluer-sounding musique,
mixt instruments and voices, gracing all the rest: How will you be rapt
with delight?"Large walkes, broad and long, close and open, like the Tempe groves in
Thessalie, raised with grauell and sand, hauing seats and bankes of
cammomile, all this delights the minde, and brings health to the body."View now with delight the workes of your owne hands, your fruit-trees
of all sorts, loaden with sweet blossomes, and fruit of all tasts,
operations, and colours: your trees standing in comely order which way
soeuer you looke."Your borders on euery side hanging and drooping with feberries,
raspberries, barberries, currens, and the rootes of your trees powdred
with strawberries, red, white, and greene, what a pleasure is this?Your
gardner can frame your lesser wood to the shape of men armed in the
field, ready to giue battell: or swift running greyhounds: or of well
sented and true running hounds, to chase the deere, or hunt the hare.This kind of hunting shall not waste your corne, nor much your coyne."Mazes well framed a mans height, may perhaps make your friends wander
in gathering of berries, till he cannot recouer himselfe without your
helpe."To haue occasion to exercise within your Orchard: it shall be a
pleasure to haue a bowling alley, or rather (which is more manly, and
more healthfull) a paire of buts, to stretch your armes."Rosemary and sweete eglantine are seemely ornaments about a doore or
window, and so is woodbinde."And in mine opinion, I could highly commend your Orchard, if either
through it, or hard by it there should runne a pleasant riuer with
siluer streames: you might sit in your mount, and angle a pickled trout,
or sleightie eele, or some other dainty fish.Or moats, whereon you
might row with a boate, and fish with nettes."Store of bees in a dry and warme bee-house, comely made of fir-boords,
to sing, and sit, and feede vpon your flowers and sprouts, make a
pleasant noyse and sight.For cleanely and innocent bees, of all other
things, loue and become, and thriue in an Orchard.If they thriue (as
they must needes, if your gardner bee skilfull, and loue them: for they
loue their friends, and hate none but their enemies) they will, besides
the pleasure, yeeld great profit, to pay him his wages.Yea, the
increase of twenty stockes or stooles, with other fees, will keepe your
Orchard."You need not doubt their stings, for they hurt not whom they know, and
they know their keeper and acquaintance.If you like not to come amongst
them, you need not doubt them: for but neere their store, and in their
owne defence, they will not fight, and in that case onely (and who can
blame them?)Some (as that
Honorable Lady at Hacknes, whose name doth much grace mine Orchard) vse
to make seats for them in the stone wall of their Orchard, or Garden,
which is good, but wood is better."A vine ouer-shadowing a seate, is very comely, though her grapes with
vs ripe slowly."One chiefe grace that adornes an Orchard, I cannot let slip: A brood of
nightingales, who with their seuerall notes and tunes, with a strong
delightsome voyce, out of a weake body, will beare you company night and
day.She loues (and liues in) hots of woods in her hart.She will helpe
you to cleanse your trees of caterpillars, and all noysome wormes and
flyes.The gentle robin red-breast will helpe her, and in winter in the
coldest stormes will keepe a part.Neither will the silly wren be behind
in summer, with her distinct whistle (like a sweete recorder) to cheere
your spirits."The black-bird and threstle (for I take it the thrush sings not, but
deuoures) sing loudly in a May morning, delights the eare much (and you
neede not want their company, if you haue ripe cherries or berries, and
would as gladly as the rest do you pleasure:) But I had rather want
their company than my fruit.A thousand of pleasant delightes are attendant in an
Orchard: and sooner shall I be weary, than I can recken the least part
of that pleasure, which one that hath and loues an Orchard, may find
therein."What is there of all these few that I haue reckoned, which doth not
please the eye, the eare, the smell, and taste?And by these sences as
organes, pipes, and windowes, these delights are carried to refresh the
gentle, generous, and noble mind."To conclude, what ioy may you haue, that you liuing to such an age,
shall see the blessings of God on your labours while you liue, and
leaue behind you to heires or successors (for God will make heires) such
a worke, that many ages after your death, shall record your loue to
their countrey?And the rather, when you consider (chap.to what
length of time your worke is like to last."Page 30.--Having briefly glanced in this page at the delight with which
Sir H. Davy, Mr.Whateley, viewed the flowers of
spring, I can only add this reflection of Sturm:--"If there were no
stronger proofs on earth of the power, goodness, and wisdom of God, the
flowers of spring alone, would be sufficient to convince us of it."Page 45.--The character of this modest and candid man, (Switzer), has
found an able advocate in the honest pen of Mr.159
of his History of Gardening, after noticing the acrimony of his
opponents, observes, "Neglect has pursued him beyond the grave, for his
works are seldom mentioned or quoted as authorities of the age he lived
in.To me he appears to be the best author of his time; and if I was
called upon to point out the classic authors of gardening, _Switzer_
should be one of the first on whom I would lay my finger.His works
evidence him at once to have been a sound, practical horticulturist, a
man well versed in the botanical science of the day, in its most
enlarged sense."Johnson enumerates the distinct contents of each
chapter in the Iconologia--the Kitchen Gardener--and the Fruit Gardener.Page 59.--The Tortworth Chesnut was growing previous to the Norman
Conquest.Even in the reign of
Stephen, it was known as the great chesnut of Tortworth.Page 62.--The author of this treatise, who is a zealous orchardist, is
lavish in his praise of a then discovered apple-tree and its produce,
"for the little cot-house to which it belongs, together with the little
quillet in which it stands, being several years since mortgaged for ten
pounds, the fruit of this tree alone, in a course of some years, freed
the house and garden, and its more valuable self, from that burden."A
neighbouring clergyman, too, was equally lavish, for he "talked of it in
all conversations," and such was his praise of it, that every one "fell
to admiration."Stafford is so pleased with this reverend
gentleman's zeal, in extending the cultivation of this apple, (_the
Royal Wilding_) that he says, "I could really wish, whenever the
original tree decayeth, his statue carved out of the stump, by the most
expert hand, and overlaid with gold, may be erected near the public
road, in the place of it, at the common charge of the country."He
celebrates also another apple, which "in a pleasant conversation was
named by a gentleman _super-celestial_.Another gentleman, in allusion
to _Pynes_, the name of my house, and to the common story of the West
India pineapple, (which is said to be the finest fruit in the world, and
to represent every exquisite flavour that is known), determined that it
should be called the _pyne-apple_; and by either of these names it is
talked of when pleasantry and conversation bring the remembrance of it
to the table."Page 64.--It is but justice to Mr.Gibson to say, that in his Fruit
Gardener, he has entered fully into the merits of Le Genre's _Le maniere
de cultiver les arbres fruitiers_; and that his pages are extremely
interesting.The great merits of Quintinye are also not overlooked.Page 84.--To the list of those deceased authors, whose portraits I have
not been able to discover, I must add the following:


JOHN BRADDICK, Esq.A zealous horticulturist and fruit grower.He
contributed four papers to the Horticultural Society of London.1827, is a communication by him, on some new
French pears.The editor of this magazine acknowledges "the very liberal
and truly patriotic manner in which our highly-valued correspondent
shares every novelty he receives with those whose interest it is to
increase and disseminate such novelties."In the above magazine for
March, 1827, is another spirited communication by him, on these new
pears, introduced from France, in which he says:--"And here I think it
necessary to premise, that the following list is the cream skimmed off
some thousands of new pears, which I have for many years past been
getting together from various parts of the world, about two-thirds of
which yet remain for trial, not having fruited, together with some
thousands of seedling pears, apples, plums, cherries, apricots, peaches
and grapes, of my own raising; the fruits of some of which I hope will
continue to gladden the hearts of horticulturists for many years to
come.As they are produced I will make them known to the public, with as
much facility as lies in my power."_Boughton Mount, July 29, 1826._"

One is sorry to relate, that Mr.Braddick died soon after this
benevolent wish; for he died at the above seat of his, near Maidstone,
in April, 1828, at the age of sixty-three.Dibdin thus speaks of Archibald Alison: "The beautiful
and melodious style of this writer, renders his works deserving of a
conspicuous place in every well-chosen library."Page 89.--In this page I have stated that Dr.Dibdin says, "on many
accounts does G. Markham seem entitled to more notice and commendation."I have given extracts from his "English Husbandman," to shew his love
for flowers.The same attachment is visible where he enumerates them in
his "Country House-wive's Garden."--By the bye, though I have stated
this last work to be his, it surely appears to have been written by W.
Lawson.I merely now give the following extract from Markham's "English
House-Wife:"

"Next vnto this sanctity and holinesse of life, it is meet that our
English hous-wife be a woman of great modesty and temperance as well
inwardly as outwardly; inwardly, as in her behauiour and cariage towards
her husband, wherein she shall shunne all violence of rage, passion, and
humour, coueting lesse to direct then to be directed, appearing euer
vnto him pleasant, amiable, and delightfull, and though occasion,
mishaps, or the misgouernement of his will may induce her to contrary
thoughts, yet vertuously to suppresse them, and with a mild sufferance
rather to call him home from his error, then with the strength of anger
to abate the least sparke of his euill, calling in her mind that euill
and vncomely language is deformed though vttered euen to seruants, but
most monstrous and vgly when it appeares before the presence of a
husband: outwardly, as in her apparrell and diet, both which she shall
proportion according to the competency of her husband's estate and
calling, making her circle rather strait then large, for it is a rule if
we extend to the vttermost, we take away increase, if we goe a hayre
breadth beyond, we enter into consumption: but if we preserue any part,
we build strong forts against the aduersaries of fortune, prouided that
such preseruation be honest and conscionable: for a lauish prodigality
is brutish, so miserable couetuousnesse is hellish.Let therefore the
hus-wives garments be comly and strong, made aswel to preserue the
health, as adorne the person, altogether without toyish garnishes, or
the glosse of light colours, and as far from the vanity of new and
fantastick fashions, as neere to the comly imitations of modest
matrons."I must give an extract from his "Country Contentements," as he reminds
us of Shakspeare's lines on the tuneable cry of hounds; for Markham
dwells on their sweetness of cry--"their deepe solemne mouthes--their
roaring and loud ringing mouthes, which must beare the counter-tenor,
then some hollow plaine sweete mouthes--a deep-mouthed dog--a couple or
two of small singing beagles, which as small trebles, may warble amongst
them: the cry will be a great deale the more sweeter--the hollow deepe
mouth--the loud clanging mouthe--deepe flewed, such as for the most part
your _Shropshire_ and pure _Worcestershire_ dogs are--the louder and
pleasanter your cry will be, especially if it be in sounding tall woods,
or under the echo of rocks--and not above one couple of roarers, which
being heard but now and then, as at the opening or hitting of a scent,
will give much sweetnesse to the solemns, and gravenesse of the cry, and
the musick thereof will bee much more delightfull to the eares of every
beholder."Page 123.--The memory of Pope has perhaps never been more affectionately
honoured (nor that of Lord Mendip, who so zealously preserved every part
of the house and garden at Twickenham) than in the glowing and tender
lines of De Lille, in his poem of _Les Jardins_.The vignette in my title-page, and that at page 84, are two of those
neat decorations which so profusely embellish the Encyclopaedia of
Gardening.A.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] Few persons have shewn more attachment to family portraits than Miss
Seward.This is strongly exemplified in several bequests in her will;
not only in her bequest to Emma Sneyd, and in that to Mrs.Powys, but
also in the following:--"The miniature picture of my late dear friend,
Mr.Saville, drawn in 1770, by the late celebrated artist Smart, and
which at the time it was taken, and during many successive years, was an
exact resemblance of the original, I bequeath to his daughter, Mrs.Smith, who I know will value and preserve it as a jewel above all prize;
and in case of her previous demise, I bequeath the said precious
miniature to her daughter, Mrs.Honora Jager, exhorting the said Honora
Jager, and her heirs, into whose hands soever it may fall, to guard it
with sacred care from the sun and from damp, as I have guarded it, that
so the posterity of my valued friend may know what, in his prime, was
the form of him whose mind through life, by the acknowledgment of all
who knew him, and could discern the superior powers of talent and
virtue, was the seat of liberal endowment, warm piety, and energetic
benevolence."Being thus on the subject of portraits, let me remark, that it is not
always that we meet with a faithful likeness.de
Genlis's _Petrarch et Laure_, justly observes, that "it is doubtful if
any of the portraits of _Petrarch_, which still remain, were painted
during his life-time.However that may be, it is impossible to trace in
them, either the elevation of his mind, the fire of his imagination, or
the pensive melancholy of his soul."In the Essays on Petrarch, by Ugo
Foscolo, he informs us, that "_Petrarch's_ person, if we trust his
biographers, was so striking with beauties, as to attract universal
admiration.They represent him with large and manly features, eyes full
of fire, a blooming complexion, and a countenance that bespoke all the
genius and fancy that shone forth in his works."Do we yet know one
really good likeness of _Mary Queen of Scots_?[2] It has often struck me (perhaps erroneously), that the attachment
which the great Sully evinced for gardens, even to the last period of
his long-protracted life, (eighty-two), _might_ in some degree have been
cherished or increased from the writings of the great Lord Bacon.When
this illustrious duke retired to his country seats, wounded to the heart
by the baseness of those who had flattered him when Henry was alive, his
noble and honest mind indulged in the embellishment of his gardens.I
will very briefly quote what history relates:--"The life he led in his
retreat at _Villebon_, was accompanied with grandeur and even majesty,
such as might be expected from a character so grave and full of dignity
as his.His table was served with taste and magnificence; he admitted to
it none but the nobility in his neighbourhood, some of the principal
gentlemen, and the ladies and maids of honour, who belonged to the
duchess of Sully.He often went into his gardens, and passing through a
little covered alley, which separated the flower from the kitchen
garden, ascended by a stone staircase (which the present duke of Sully
has caused to be destroyed), into a large walk of linden trees, upon a
terrace on the other side of the garden.It was then the taste to have a
great many narrow walks, very closely shaded with four or five rows of
trees, or palisadoes.Here he used to sit upon a settee painted green,
amused himself by beholding on the one side an agreeable landscape, and
on the other a second alley on a terrace extremely beautiful, which
surrounded a large piece of water, and terminated by a wood of lofty
trees.There was scarce one of his estates, those especially which had
castles on them, where he did not leave marks of his magnificence, to
which he was chiefly incited by a principle of charity, and regard to
the public good.At _Rosny_, he raised that fine terrace, which runs
along the Seine, to a prodigious extent, and those great gardens, filled
with groves, arbours, and grottos, with water-works.He embellished
_Sully_ with gardens, of which the plants were the finest in the world,
and with a canal, supplied with fresh water by the little river Sangle,
which he turned that way, and which is afterwards lost in the Loire.He
erected a machine to convey the water to all the basons and fountains,
of which the gardens are full.He enlarged the castle of _La Chapelle
d'Angillon_, and embellished it with gardens and terraces."These gardens somewhat remind one of these lines, quoted by Barnaby
Gooche:

   _Have fountaines sweet at hand, or mossie waters,
   Or pleasaunt brooke, that passing through the meads, is sweetly seene._

That fine gardens delighted Sully, is evident even from his own
statement of his visit to the Duke d'Aumale's, at Anet, near Ivry,
(where Henry and Sully fought in that famous battle), for he says,--"Joy
animated the countenance of Madame d'Aumale the moment she perceived me.She gave me a most kind and friendly reception, took me by the hand, and
led me through those fine galleries and beautiful gardens, which make
Anet a most enchanting place."One may justly apply to Sully, what he
himself applies to the Bishop of Evreaux: "A man for whom eloquence and
great sentiments had powerful charms."I had designed some few years ago, to have published a Review of some of
the superb Gardens in France, during the reign of Henry IV.and during
the succeeding reigns, till the demise of Louis XV., embellished with
plates of some of the costly and magnificent decorations of those times;
with extracts from such of their eminent writers whose letters or works
may have occasionally dwelt on gardens.--My motto, for want of a better,
might have been these two lines from Rapin,

   _----France, in all her rural pomp appears
   With numerous gardens stored._

Perhaps I might have been so greedy and insolent, as to have presumed to
have monopolized our Shakspeare's line,--"I love _France_ so well, that
I will not part with a village of it; I will have it all mine."Isaac Walton gives the following lines from a translation of a German
poet, which makes one equally fond of England:

   We saw so many woods, and princely bowers,
   Sweet fields, brave palaces, and stately towers,
   _So many gardens dress'd with curious care_,
   That Thames with royal Tiber may compare.[3] The Encyclopaedia of Gardening has a rich page (35) devoted to Le
Notre.thus records his genius and his grand and
magnificent efforts:--"Ce grand homme fut choisi pour decorer les
jardins du chateau de Vau-le-Vicomte.Il en fit un sejour enchanteur,
par les ornamens nouveaux, pleins de magnificence, qu'il y prodigua.On
vit alors, pour la premiere fois, des portiques, des berceaux, des
grottes, des traillages, des labyrinths, &c. embellir varier le
spectacle des jardins.Le Roi, temoin des ces merveilles, lui donna la
direction de tous ses parcs.Il embellit par son art, Versailles,
Trianon, et il fit a St.Germain cette fameuse terrasse qu'on voit
toujours avec une nouvelle admiration.Les jardins de Clagny, de
Chantilly, de St.Cloud, de Meudon, de Sceaux, le parterre du Tibre, et
les canaux qui ornent ce lieu champetre a Fontainbleau, sont encore son
ouvrage.Il demanda a faire voyage de l'Italie, dans l'esperance
d'acquerir de nouvelles connoissances; mais son genie createur l'avoit
conduit a la perfection.Il ne vit rien de comparable a ce qu'il avoit
fait en France."Notwithstanding the above just and high tribute, I have no hesitation in
saying, that it is not superior to the magic picture which the
fascinating pen of Mad.de Sevigne has drawn of le Notre's creative
genius, in her letter of Aug.Many others of this charming
woman's letters breathe her love of gardens.[4] The Nouveau Dict.thus speaks of the Pere Rapin:--"A un genie
heureux, a un gout sur, il joignoit une probite exacte, un coeur droit,
un caractere aimable et des moeurs douces.Il etoit naturellement
honnete, et il s'etoit encore poli dans le commerce des grands.Parmi
ses differentes Poesies Latines, on distingue le Poeme des Jardins.C'est son chef d'oeuvre; il est digne du siecle d'Auguste, dit l'Abbe
Des Fontaines, pour l'elegance et la purete du langage, pour l'esprit et
les graces qui y regnent."Among the letters of Rabutin de Bussy, are
many most interesting ones from this worthy father.[5] "Rien n'est plus admirable que la peinture naive que la Pere Vaniere
fait des amusemens champetres; on est egalement enchante de la richesse
et de la vivacite de son imagination, de l'eclat et de l'harmonie de sa
poesie, du choix de la purete de ses expressions.Il mourut a Toulouse
en 1739, et plusiers poetes ornerent de fleurs son tombeau."--Nouv.[6] La Comtesse de la Riviere, thus alludes to this convent: "Madame de
Sevigne a pour ce monastere une veneration qui est audela de toute
expression; elle assure qu'on n'approche pas de ce lieu sans sentir au
dedans de soi une onction divine."[7] The late Sir U. Price, pays a very high compliment to this exquisite
poem, in p.i. of his Essays, terming it full of the justest
taste, and most brilliant imagery.[8] In the Earl of Harcourt's garden, at Nuneham, in Oxfordshire, (laid
out in some parts under the eye and fine taste of the poet Mason), on a
bust of Rousseau are these lines:

   Say, is thy honest heart to virtue warm?Approach, behold this venerable form;
     'Tis Rousseau!There are attractive pages in this little volume of the Viscount's,
which would have interested either Shenstone, or Gainsborough,
particularly the pages 59, 143, 145, and 146, (of Mr.Malthus's
translation), for in these pages "we feel all the truth and energy of
nature."131, will enable the reader to judge of
the writer's style:--"When the cool evening sheds her soft and
delightful tints, and leads on the hours of pleasure and repose, then is
the universal reign of sublime harmony.It is at this happy moment that
Claude has caught the tender colouring, the enchanting calm, which
equally attaches the heart and the eyes; it is then that the fancy
wanders with tranquillity over distant scenes.Masses of trees through
which the light penetrates, and under whose foliage winds a pleasant
path; meadows, whose mild verdure is still softened by the transparent
shades of the evening; crystal waters which reflect all the near objects
in their pure surface; mellow tints, and distances of blue vapour; such
are in general the objects best suited to a western exposure.The sun,
before he leaves the horizon, seems to blend earth and sky, and it is
from sky that evening views receive their greatest beauty.The
imagination dwells with delight upon the exquisite variety of soft and
pleasing colours, which embellishes the clouds and the distant country,
in this peaceful hour of enjoyment and contemplation."[9] He was enthusiastically devoted to the cultivation of his gardens,
which exhibited enchanting scenery, umbrageous walks, and magnificent
water-falls.When thus breathing the pure air of rural life, the
blood-stained monsters of 1793 seized him in his garden, and led him to
the scaffold."He heard unmoved his own sentence, but the condemnation
of his daughter and grand-daughter, tore his heart: the thought of
seeing two weak and helpless creatures perish, shook his fortitude.Being taken back to the _Conciergerie_, his courage returned, and he
exhorted his children to prepare for death.When the fatal bell rung, he
recovered all his wonted cheerfulness; having paid to nature the tribute
of feeling, he desired to give his children an example of magnanimity;
his looks exhibited the sublime serenity of virtue, and taught them to
view death undismayed.When he ascended the cart, he conversed with his
children, unaffected by the clamours of the ferocious populace; and on
arriving at the foot of the scaffold, took a last and solemn farewell of
his children; immediately after he was dismissed into eternity."Sir Walter Scott, after noticing "the wild and squalid features" of
Marat, who "lay concealed in some obscure garret or cellar, among his
cut-throats, until a storm appeared, when, like a bird of ill omen, his
death-screech was again heard," thus states the death of another of the
murderers of the Malherbes:--"Robespierre, in an unsuccessful attempt to
shoot himself, had only inflicted a horrible _fracture on his
under-jaw_.In this situation they were found like wolves in their lair,
foul with blood, mutilated, despairing, and yet not able to die.Robespierre lay on a table in an anti-room, his head supported by a deal
box, and his hideous countenance half-hidden by a bloody and dirty cloth
bound round his shattered chin.As the fatal cars passed to the
guillotine, those who filled them, but especially Robespierre, were
overwhelmed with execrations.The nature of his previous wound, from
which the cloth had never been removed till the executioner _tore_ it
off, added to the torture of the sufferer.The shattered jaw dropped,
and the wretch yelled aloud, to the horror of the spectators.A mask
taken from that dreadful head was long exhibited in different nations of
Europe, and appalled the spectator by its ugliness, and the mixture of
fiendish expression with that of bodily agony."Malherbes loved to relate an answer made to him by a common
fellow, during his stay at Paris, when he was obliged to go four times
every day to the prison of the Temple, to attend the king: his extreme
age did not allow him to walk, and he was compelled to take a carriage.One day, particularly, when the weather was intensely severe, he
perceived, on coming out of the vehicle, that the driver was benumbed
with cold."My friend," said Malherbes to him, in his naturally tender
manner, "you must be penetrated by the cold, and I am really sorry to
take you abroad in this bitter season."--"That's nothing, M. de
Malherbes; in such a cause as this, I'd travel to the world's end
without complaining."--"Yes, but your poor horses could not."--"Sir,"
replied the honest coachman, "_my horses think as I do_."[10] I cannot pass by the name of Henry, without the recollection of
what an historian says of him: "L'Abbe Langlet du Fresnoy a publie
cinquante-neuf lettres de a bon Roi, dans sa nouvelle edition du Journal
de Henry III.on y remarque du feu de l'esprit, de l'imagination, et
sur-tout cette eloquence du coeur, qui plait tout dans un monarque.--On
l'exortoit a traiter avec rigueur quelques places de la Ligue, qu'il
avoit redites par la force: _La satisfaction qu'on tire de la vengeance
ne dure qu'un moment_ (repondit ce prince genereuse) _mais celle qu'on
tire de la clemence est eternelle_.Plus on connoitre Henri, plus on
l'aimera, plus on l'admiriroet."[11] The king, knowing his fine taste for sculpture and painting, sent
him to Italy, and the Nouv.gives this anecdote: "La Pape
instruit de son merite, voulut le voir, et lui donna une assez longue
audience, sur la fin de laquelle le Notre s'ecria en s'adressant au
Pape: J'ai vu les plus grands hommes du monde, Votre Saintete, et le Roi
mon maitre.Il y a grande difference, dit le Pape; le Roi est un grand
prince victorieux, je suis un pauvre pretre serviteur des serviteurs de
Dieu.Le Notre, charme de cette reponse, oublia qui la lui faisoit, et
frappant sur l'epaule du Pape lui repondit a son tour: Mon Reverend
Pere, vous vous portez bien et vous enterrerez tout la Sacre College.Le
Pape, qui entendoit le Francois, rit du pronostic.Le Notre, charme de
plus en plus de sa bonte, et de l'estime particuliere qu'il temoignoit
pour le Roi, se jeta au cou du Pape et l'embrassa.C'etoit au reste sa
coutume d'embrasser tous ceux qui publioient les louanges de Louis XIV.,
et il embrassoit le Roi lui-meme, toutes les fois que ce prince revenoit
de la campagne."[12] I will conclude by mentioning a justly celebrated man, who, it
seems was not over fond of his garden, though warmly attached both to
Boileau, and to Mad.de Sevigne,--I mean that most eloquent preacher
Bossuet, of whom a biographer, after stating that he was so absorbed in
the study of the ancient fathers of the church, "qu'il ne se permettoit
que des delassemens fort courts.Il ne se promenoit que rarement meme
dans son jardin.Son jardinier lui dit un jour: _Si je plantois des
Saint Augustins, et des Saint Chrysostomes, vous les viendriez voir;
mais pour vos arbres, vous ne vous en souciez guere_."Worlidge, who wrote during part of the reigns of Charles II.judiciously observes, that "the glory of the French
palaces, often represented to our English eyes in sculpture, are adorned
_with their beauteous gardens before them_; which wanting, they would
seem without lustre or grandeur."[14] He was fined L30,000 for having taken a favourite of the king's, in
the very presence chamber, by the nose, for having insulted him, and
afterwards dragging him out of the room.[15] It was to this nobleman, that Addison addressed his elegant and
sublime epistle, after he had surveyed with the eyes and genius of a
classical poet, the monuments and heroic deeds of ancient Rome.[16] Lord Chesterfield thus speaks of this distinguished man:--"His
private life was stained by no vices, nor sullied by any meanness.His
eloquence was of every kind; but his invectives were terrible, and
uttered with such energy of diction and countenance, that he intimidated
those who were the most willing and the best able to encounter him."Sir
W. Chatham Trelawney used to observe of him, that it was impossible for
the members of the side opposed to him in the House of Commons to look
him in the face when he was warmed in debate: he seemed to bid them all
a haughty defiance."For my own part," said Trelawney, "I never dared
cast my eyes towards his, for if I did, _they nailed me to the floor_."Smollet says, that he displayed "such irresistible energy of argument,
and such power of elocution, as struck his hearers with astonishment and
admiration.It flashed like the lightning of heaven against the
ministers and sons of corruption, blasting where it smote, and withering
the nerves of opposition; but his more substantial praise was founded
upon his disinterested integrity, his incorruptible heart, his
unconquerable spirit of independance, and his invariable attachment to
the interest and liberty of his country."Another biographer thus
mentions him:--"His elevated aspect commanded the awe and mute attention
of all who beheld him, whilst a certain grace in his manner, conscious
of all the dignities of his situation, of the solemn scene he acted in,
as well as his own exalted character, seemed to acknowledge and repay
the respect he received; his venerable form, bowed with infirmity and
age, but animated by a mind which nothing could subdue; his spirit
shining through him, arming his eye with lightning, and cloathing his
lips with thunder; or, if milder topics offered, harmonizing his
countenance in smiles, and his voice in softness, for the compass of his
powers was infinite.As no idea was too vast, no imagination too
sublime, for the grandeur and majesty of his manner; so no fancy was too
playful, nor any allusion too comic, for the ease and gaiety with which
he could accommodate to the occasion.But the character of his oratory
was dignity; this presided in every respect, even to his sallies of
pleasantry."[17] Sir Walter Scott's attachment to gardens, breaks out even in his
Life of Swift, where his fond enquiries have discovered the sequestered
and romantic garden of _Vanessa_, at Marley Abbey.[18] So thought Sir W. Raleigh;

   Sweet violets, love's paradise, that spread
     Your gracious odours...
   Upon the gentle wing of some calm-breathing wind,
       That plays amidst the plain.The lines in Twelfth Night we all recollect:

   That strain again;--it had a dying fall:
   O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south
   That breathes upon a bank of _violets_,
   Stealing and giving odour.That these flowers were the most favourite ones of Shakspeare, there can
be little doubt--Perditta fondly calls them

   ----sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
   Or Cytherea's breath.When Petrarch first saw Laura: "elle avail une robe verte, sa coleur
favorite, parsemee de _violettes_, la plus humble des fleurs."--Childe
Harold thus paints this flower:

   The sweetness of the violet's deep blue eyes
   (Kiss'd by the breath of heaven) seems colour'd by its skies.[19] One almost fancies one perceives Lord Bacon's attachment to
gardens, or to rural affairs, even in the speech he made before the
nobility, when first taking his seat in the High Court of Chancery; he
hoped "that these same _brambles_ that _grow_ about justice, of needless
charge and expence, and all manner of exactions, might be rooted out;"
adding also, that immediate and "_fresh_ justice was the _sweetest_."Mason, in a note to his English Garden, after paying a high
compliment to Lord Bacon's picturesque idea of a garden, thus concludes
that note:--"Such, when he descended to matters of more elegance (for,
when we speak of Lord Bacon, to treat of these was to descend,) were the
amazing powers of this universal genius."Pope's delight in gardens, is visible even in the condensed
allusion he makes to them, in a letter to Mr.Digby; "I have been above
a month strolling about in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, from garden
to garden, but still returning to Lord Cobham's, with fresh
satisfaction.I should be sorry to see my Lady Scudamore's, till it has
had the full advantage of Lord Bathurst's improvements."[21] A biographer thus speaks of the Prince de Ligne: "Quand les rois se
reunirent a Vienne en 1814, ils se firent tous un devoir de l'accuellier
avec distinction, et furent enchante de la vivacite de son esprit, et de
son intarissable gaiete, qui malgre ses infirmites et son grand age, ne
l'avoit pasencore abandonne.Ses saillies, et ses bon mots etoient comme
autrefois repetes pour tous."His generous heart thus speaks of the
abused and unfortunate Marie Antoinette:--"The breath of calumny has not
even respected the memory of the loveliest and best of women, of whose
spotless heart and irreproachable conduct, no one can bear stronger
evidence than I. Her soul was as pure as her face was fair; yet neither
virtue nor beauty could save the victim of sanguinary liberty."In
relating this (says his biographer), his voice faultered, and his eyes
were suffused with tears.He thus briefly states, with his usual humour
and vivacity, his conversation with Voltaire as to the garden at Ferney:

_P.de L._--Monsieur, Monsieur, cela doit vous coupe beaucoup, quel
charmant jardin!mon jardinier est un bete: c'est moi meme qui ait fait
tout.[22] Monsieur Thomas, in his eulogy of Descartes says, it should have
been pronounced at the foot of Newton's statue: or rather, Newton
himself should have been his panegyrist.Of this eulogy, Voltaire, in a
most handsome letter to Mons.Thomas, thus speaks:--"votre ouvrage
m'enchante d'un bout a l'autre, et Je vais le relire des que J'aurai
dicte ma lettre."The sleep and expanding of flowers are most
interestingly reviewed by Mr.187 of his Encyclop., and by
M. V. H. de Thury, in the above discourse, a few pages preceding his
seducing description of the magnificent garden of M. de Boursault.So late ago as the year 1804 it was proposed at Avignon, to erect an
obelisk in memory of Petrarch, at Vaucluse: "il a ete decide, qu'on
l'elevera, vis-avis _l'ancien jardin_ de Petrache, lieu ou le lit de
sorgue forme un angle."Walpole observes) was planted by the poet,
enriched by him with the fairy gift of eternal summer.Pope thus mentions the vines round this cave:--

   Depending vines the shelving cavern skreen,
   With purple clusters blushing through the green.are devoted to a very
interesting research on the gardens of the Romans.Sir Joseph Banks has
a paper on the Forcing Houses of the Romans, with a list of Fruits
cultivated by them, now in our gardens, in vol.Pulteney gives a list of several manuscripts in the Bodleian
Library, the writers of which are unknown, and the dates not precisely
determined, but supposed to have been written, if not prior to the
invention of printing, at least before the introduction of that art into
England.I select the two following.--

No.De Arboribus, Aromatis, et _Floribus_.Glossarium Latino-anglicum Arborum, _Fructuum_, Frugam, &c.

And he states the following from Bib.S. Petri Cant:--

No.Notabilia de Vegetabilibus, et Plantis.Pulteney observes, that the above list might have been considerably
extended, but that it would have unnecessarily swelled the article he
was then writing.mentions a personage whose attachment to his
garden, and one of whose motives for cultivating that garden, does not
deserve a notice:--"Attale III.Roi de Pergame, fils de Stratonice,
soulla la throne en repandant le sang de ses amis et de sea parens.Il
abandonna ensuite le soin de ses affaires _pour s'occuper entirement de
son jardin_.Il y cultivoit des poisons, tels que l'aconit et la cigue,
qu'il envoyoit quelque fois en present a ses amis.Il mourut 133 ans
avant Jesus Christ."[27] To have completed the various contrasting vicissitudes of this poor
_Suffolk_ farmer's life, he should have added to his other employments,
those of another _Suffolk_ man, the late W. Lomax, who had been
_grave-digger_ at the pleasant town of Bury St.Edmund's, for thirty-six
years, and who, also, for a longer period than thirty-six years, had
been a _morrice-dancer_ at all the elections for that borough.[28] Gerarde, speaking of good sorts of apples and pears, thus mentions
the above named _Pointer_:--"Master Richard Pointer has them all growing
in his ground at Twickenham, near London, who is a most cunning and
curious grafter and planter of all manner of rare fruits; and also in
the ground of an excellent grafter and painful planter, Master Henry
Bunbury, of Touthil-street, near unto Westminster; and likewise in the
ground of a diligent and most affectionate lover of plants, Master
Warner, neere Horsely Down, by London; and in divers other grounds about
London."[29] The fate of this poor man reminds one of what is related of
Corregio:--"He received from the mean canons of Parma, for his
Assumption of the Virgin, the small pittance of two hundred livres, and
it was paid him in copper.He hastened with the money to his starving
family; but as he had six or eight miles to travel from Parma, the
weight of his burden, and the heat of the climate, added to the
oppression of his breaking heart, a pleurisy attacked him, which, in
three days, terminated his existence and his sorrows in his fortieth
year."If one could discover a portrait of either of the authors mentioned in
the foregoing list, one might, I think, inscribe under each of such
portraits, these verses:

   Ce pourtrait et maint liure
   Par le peintre et l'escrit,
   Feront reuoir et viure
   Ta face et ton esprit.They are inscribed under an ancient portrait, done in 1555, which Mr.Dibdin has preserved in his account of Caen, and which he thus
introduces: "As we love to be made acquainted with the _persons_ of
those from whom we have received instruction and pleasure, so take,
gentle reader, a representation of Bourgueville."John Parkinson, an apothecary of this city, (yet living, and
labouring for the common good,) in the year 1629, set forth a work by
the name of _Paradisus Terrestris_, wherein he gives the figures of all
such plants as are preserved in gardens, for the beauty of their
flowers, in use in meats or sauces; and also an orchard for all trees
bearing fruit, and such shrubs as for their beauty are kept in orchards
and gardens, with the ordering, planting, and preserving of all these.In this work he hath not superficially handled these things, but
accurately descended to the very varieties in each species, wherefore I
have now and then referred my reader, addicted to these delights, to
this work, especially in flowers and fruits, wherein I was loth to spend
too much time, especially seeing I could adde nothing to what he had
done upon that subject before."Hartlib (says Worlidge) tells you of the benefits of _orchard
fruits_, that they afford curious walks for pleasure, food for cattle in
the spring, summer, and winter, (meaning under their shadow,) fewel for
the fire, shade for the heat, physick for the sick, refreshment for the
sound, plenty of food for man, and that not of the worst, and drink also
of the best."Milton also in the above Tractate thus speaks:--"In those vernal seasons
of the year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury and
sullenness against nature, not to go out and see her riches, and partake
in her rejoicing with heaven and earth."[32] In the above tract of Dr.Beale's, he thus breaks out in praise of
the Orchards of this _deep and rich_ county:--"From the greatest person
to the poorest cottager, all habitations are encompassed with orchards,
and gardens, and in most places our hedges are enriched with rows of
fruit trees, pears or apples.All our villages, and generally all our
highways, (all our vales being thick set with rows of villages), are in
the spring time sweetened and beautified with the blossomed trees, which
continue their changeable varieties of ornament, till (in the end of
autumn), they fill our garners with pleasant fruit, and our cellars with
rich and winy liquors.Orchards, being the pride of our county, do not
only sweeten, but also purify the ambient air, which I conceive to
conduce very much to the constant health and long lives for which our
county hath always been famous.We do commonly devise a shadowy walk
from our gardens, through our orchards (which is the richest, sweetest,
and most embellished grove) into our coppice woods, or timber woods."Beale does not praise the whole of their land.He describes some as
"starvy, chapt, and cheany, as the basest land upon the Welch
mountains."He makes amends, however, for this, for he describes the
nags bred on their high grounds, as very different from our present
hackney-coach horses; they "are airey and sinewy, full of spirits and
vigour, in shape like the _barbe_, they rid ground, and gather courage
and delight in their own speed."[33] A Lady Gerard is mentioned in two letters of Mr.Pope, to W.
Fortescue, Esq.They appear in Polwhele's
History of Devonshire."I have just received a note from Mrs.Blount,
that she and Lady Gerard will dine here to-day."And "Lady Gerard was to
see Chiswick Gardens (as I imagined) and therefore forced to go from
hence by five; it was a mortification to Mrs.Blount to go, when there
was a hope of seeing you and Mr.There are three more
letters, without date, to Martha Blount, written from the Wells at
Bristol, and from Stowe, in which Pope says, "I have no more room but to
give Lady Gerard my hearty services."And "once more my services to Lady
Gerard.""I desire you will write a post-letter to my man John, at what
time you would have the pine apples, to send to Lady Gerard."Probably
Martha Blount's Lady Gerard was a descendant of Rea's.[34] A most curious account of the _Tulipomania_, or rage for tulips,
formerly in Holland, may be seen in Phillips's Flora Historica.[35] Perhaps no one more truly painted rich pastoral scenes than Isaac
Walton.This occurs in many, many pages of his delightful _Angler_.The
late ardently gifted, and most justly lamented Sir Humphry Davy too, in
his _Salmonia_, has fondly caught the charms of Walton's pages.His pen
riots in the wild, the beautiful, the sweet, delicious scenery of
nature:--"how delightful in the early spring, to wander forth by some
clear stream, to see the leaf bursting from the purple bud, to scent the
odours of the bank, perfumed by the violet, and enamelled as it were
with the primrose, and the daisy; to wander upon the fresh turf below
the shade of trees, whose bright blossoms are filled with the music of
the bee."Worlidge, in his Systema Agriculturae, says, that the
delights in angling "rouzes up the ingenious early in the spring
mornings, that they have the benefit of the sweet and pleasant morning
air, which many through sluggishness enjoy not; so that health (the
greatest treasure that mortals enjoy) and pleasure, go hand in hand in
this exercise.What can be more said of it, than that the most
ingenious, most use it."Whately, in his usual charming style, thus
paints the spring:--"Whatever tends to animate the scene, accords with
the season, which is full of youth and vigour, fresh and sprightly,
brightened by the verdure of the herbage, and the woods, gay with
blossoms, and flowers, and enlivened by the songs of the birds in all
their variety, from the rude joy of the skylark, to the delicacy of the
nightingale."[36] Tusser seems somewhat of Meager's opinion:--

   Sow peason and beans, in the wane of the moon,
   Who soweth them sooner, he soweth too soon;
   That they with the planet may rest and arise,
   And flourish, with bearing most plentifull wise.The celebrated Quintinye says, "I solemnly declare, that after a
diligent observation of the moon's changes for thirty years together,
and an enquiry whether they had any influence in gardening, the
affirmative of which has been so long established among us, I perceive
it was no weightier than old wives' tales."Mavor) having an influence on the tides and the
weather, she was formerly supposed to extend her power over all nature.There is a treatise, by _Claude Gadrois_, on the _Influences des
Astres_.Surely this merits perusal, when the Nouv.thus
speaks of him:--"Il etoit ami du celebre Arnauld et meritoit de l'etre
par _la justesse de son esprit_ et la purete de ses moeurs, par la bonte
de son caractere et par la droiture de son coeur."The following wise experiment occurs in an ancient book on husbandry;
but if the two parties there mentioned had lived with Leonard Meager,
one must not do him the injustice of supposing he would have been a
convert to their opinion:--"_Archibius_ is said to have written (or sent
word most likely) to _Antiochus_, king of _Syria_, that if you bury a
speckled toad inclosed in an earthen pot, in the middle of your garden,
the same will be defended from all hurtful weather and tempests."Meager, however, is kept in countenance by Mr.Worlidge, who, in his
chapter of Prognostics, at the end of his interesting Systemae
Agriculturae, actually states that

If dog's guts rumble and make a noise, it presageth rain or snow.The cat, by washing her face, and putting her foot over her ear,
foreshews rain.The squeaking and skipping up and down of mice and rats, portend rain.Leonard Meager thus notices a nurseryman of his day:--"Here follows a
catalogue of divers sorts of fruits, which I had of my very loving
friend, Captain Garrle, dwelling at the great nursery between
Spittlefields and Whitechapel; a very eminent and ingenious nurseryman."Perhaps this is the same nurseryman that Rea, in his _Pomona_, mentions.He says (after naming some excellent pear-trees) "they may be had out of
the nurseries about London, especially those of Mr.Leonard _Girle_, who will faithfully furnish such as desire these,
or any other kinds of rare fruit-trees, of whose fidelity in the
delivery of right kinds, I have had long experience in divers
particulars, a virtue not common to men of that profession."At this
period, the space between Spittlefields and Whitechapel, must have
consisted of gardens, and perhaps superb country houses.The Earl of
Devonshire had a fine house and garden near Petticoat-lane.Sir W.
Raleigh had one near Mile-end.Some one (I forget the author) says, "On
both sides of this lane (Petticoat-lane) were anciently hedges and rows
of elm trees, and the pleasantness of the neighbouring fields induced
several gentlemen to build their houses here; among whom was the Spanish
Ambassador, whom Strype supposes was Gondamour."Gondamour was the
person to please whom (or rather that James might the more easily marry
his son Charles to one of the daughters of Spain, with her immense
fortune) this weak monarch was urged to sacrifice the life of Raleigh.Within one's own memory, it is painful to reflect, on the many pleasant
fields, neat paddocks, rural walks, and gardens, (breathing pure air)
that surrounded this metropolis for miles, and miles, and which are now
ill exchanged for an immense number of new streets, many of them the
receptacles only of smoke and unhealthiness.[37] These lines are from him, at whose death (says Sir W. Scott in his
generous and glowing eulogy) we were stunned "by one of those
death-notes which are peeled at intervals, as from an archangel's
trumpet"--they are from "that mighty genius which walked amongst men as
something superior to ordinary mortality, and whose powers were beheld
with wonder, and something approaching to terror, as if we knew not
whether they were of good or evil"--they are from "that noble tree which
will never more bear fruit, or blossom!which has been cut down in its
strength, and the past is all that remains to us of Byron: whose
excellences will _now_ be universally acknowledged, and his faults (let
us hope and believe) not remembered in his epitaph."His "deep
transported mind" (to apply Milton's words to him) thus continues his
moralization:--

   What are the hopes of man?old Egypt's king
     CHEOPS, erected the first pyramid,
   And largest; thinking it was just the thing
     To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;



   But somebody or other rummaging,
     Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
   Let not a monument give you, or me, hopes,
   Since not a pinch of dust remains of CHEOPS.The Quarterly Review, in reviewing Light's Travels, observes, that
"Cheops employed three hundred and sixty thousand of his subjects for
twenty years in raising this pyramid, or pile of stones, equal in weight
to six millions of tons; and to render his precious dust more secure,
the narrow chamber was made accessible only by small intricate passages,
obstructed by stones of an enormous weight, and so carefully closed,
externally, as not to be perceptible.Yet how vain are all the
precautions of man!Not a bone was left of Cheops, either in the stone
coffin, or in the vault, when Shaw entered the gloomy chamber."Sir
Walter Scott himself, has justly received many eulogies.Perhaps none
more heart-felt, than the effusion delivered at a late Celtic meeting,
by that eloquent and honest lawyer, the present Lord Chief Justice of
the Court of Exchequer, in Scotland, which was received by long, loud,
and continued applause.[38] John Bauhine wrote a Treatise in 1591, De Plantis a Divis sanctisve
nomen habentibus.has this observation: "Plants, when
taken from the places whence they derive their extraction, and planted
in others of different qualities, _betray such fondness for their native
earth_, that with great difficulty they are brought to thrive in
another; and in this it is that the florist's art consists; for _to
humour each plant_ with the soil, the sun, the shade, the degrees of
dryness or moisture, and the neighbourhood it delights in, (for there is
a natural antipathy between some plants, insomuch that they will not
thrive near one another) are things not easily attainable, but by a
length of study and application."[39] What these ruffles and lashes were, I know not.Perhaps the words
of Johnson may apply to them:--

   Fate never wounds more deep the generous heart,
   Than when a blockhead's insult points the dart.This mournful truth is every where confess'd,
   Slow rises worth, by poverty oppress'd.[40] Barnaby Gooche, in his Chapter on Gardens, calls the sun "the
captaine and authour of the other lights, _the very soule of the
world_."[41] A translation of De Lille's garden thus pleads:--

   Oh!by those shades, beneath whose evening bowers
   The village dancers tripp'd the frolic hours;
   By those deep tufts that show'd your fathers' tombs,
   Spare, ye profane, their venerable glooms!To violate their sacred age, beware,
   Which e'en the awe-struck hand of time doth spare.Whateley observes, that "The whole range of nature is open to
him, (the landscape gardener) from the parterre to the forest; and
whatever is agreeable to the senses, or the imagination, he may
appropriate to the spot he is to improve; it is a part of his business
to collect into one place, the delights which are generally dispersed
through different species of country."[43] At page 24 he says, "_Cato_, one of the most celebrated writers on
Husbandry and Gardening among the Romans, (who, as appears by his
Introduction, took the model of his precepts from the _Greeks_) in his
excellent Treatise _De Re Rustica_, has given so great an encomium on
the excellence and uses of this good plant, (the Brocoli) not only as to
its goodness in eating, but also in physick and pharmacy, that makes it
esteemed one of the best plants either the field or garden produces."[44] His Chapter on the Water-Works of the Ancient Romans, French, &c.
is charmingly written.Those who delight in the formation of rivers,
fountains, falls of water, or cascades, as decorations to their gardens,
may inspect this ingenious man's Hydrostatics.And another specimen of
his genius may be seen in the magnificent iron gateway now remaining at
_Leeswood_, near Mold, and of which a print is given in Pugh's _Cambria
Depicta_.[45] In this volume is a letter written to Switzer, from his "ingenious
friend Mr.Thomas Knowlton, Gardener to the Earl of Burlington, who, on
account of his own industry, and the opportunity he has had of being
educated under the late learned Dr.Sherrard, claims a very advanced
place in the list of Botanists."This letter is dated Lansborough, July,
1728.I insert part of this letter:--"I hope, Sir, you will excuse the
freedom I take in giving you my opinion, having always had a respect for
your endeavours in Husbandry and Gardening, ever since you commenced an
author.Your introduction to, and manner of handling those beloved
subjects, (the sale of which I have endeavoured to promote) is in great
esteem with me; being (as I think) the most useful of any that have been
wrote on these useful subjects.If on any subject, you shall hereafter
revise or write farther upon, any communication of mine will be useful
or serviceable to you, I shall be very ready to do it.I heartily wish
you success in whatever you undertake, as it tends to a publick good."Pulteney says of Knowlton, "His zeal for English Botany was
uncommonly great, and recommended him successfully to the learned
Botanists of this country.From Sir Hans Sloane, he received eminent
civilities."[46] few short notices occur of names formerly eminent in
gardening:--"My late ingenious and laborious friend, Mr._Oram_,
Nurseryman, of Brompton-lane.""That great virtuoso and encourager of gardening, Mr."Their beautiful aspects in pots, (the nonpareil) and the middle of a
desert, has been the glory of one of the most generous encouragers of
gardening this age has produced, I mean the Right Honourable the Lord
Castlemain.""The late noble and most publick spirited encourager of arts and
sciences, especially gardening, his Grace the Duke of Montague, at
Ditton.""The Elrouge Nectarine is also a native of our own, the name being the
reverse of _Gourle_, a famous Nurseryman at Hogsden, in King Charles the
Second's time, by whom it was raised."And speaking of the successful cultivation of vines in the open air, he
refers to the garden of a Mr._Rigaud_, near _Swallow-street_; and to
another great cultivator of the vine, "of whose friendship I have proof,
the Rev._Only_, of _Cottesmore_, in Rutland, some time since
deceased; one of the most curious lovers of gardening that this or any
other age has produced."This gentleman, in 1765, published "An Account
of the care taken in most civilized nations for the relief of the poor,
more particularly in the time of scarcity and distress;" 4to.I believe the same gentleman also published, in 1765, a Treatise "Of the
Price of Wheat."[47] Lord Bacon says, "Because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in
the air (where it comes and goes, like the warbling of musick) than in
the hand, therefore nothing is more fit for that delight, than to know
what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air."The Prince
de Ligne says,

   Je ne veux point avoir l'orgueilleuse tulipe;
   _L'odorat en jardin_ est mon premier principe.The translation of _Spectacle de la Nature_, a very pleasing work,
observes that "Flowers are not only intended to beautify the earth with
their shining colours, but the greatest part of them, in order to render
the entertainment more exquisite, diffuse a fragrance that perfumes all
the air around us; and it should seem as if they were solicitous to
_reserve their odours for the evening and morn_, when walking is most
agreeable; but their sweets are very faint during the heat of the day,
when we visit them the least."I must again trespass on the pages of the great Bacon, by briefly
shewing the _natural wildness_ he wishes to introduce into one part of
his garden:--"thickets, made only of sweet-briar and honeysuckle, and
some wild vine amongst, and the ground set with violets, strawberries,
and primroses; for these are sweet, and prosper in the shade."The dew or pearly drops that one sees in a morning on cowslips, remind
one of what is said of Mignon:--"Ses ouvrages sont precieux par l'art
avec le quel il representoit les fleurs dans tout leur eclat, et les
fruits avec toute leur fraicheur.La rosee et les goutes d'eau qu'elle
repand sur les fleurs, sont si bien imitees dans ses tableaux, qu'on est
tente d'y porter la main."It is said also that in the works of
Van-Huysum, "le veloute des fruits, l'eclat des fleurs, le transparent
de la rosee, tout enchante dans les tableaux de ce peintre admirable."Sir U. Price observes of this latter painter, "that nature herself is
hardly more soft and delicate in her most delicate productions, than the
copies of them by Van-Huysum."Two flower pieces by this painter, sold
at the Houghton sale for 1200_l._

In the pieces of _Bos_, a Flemish painter, the dew was represented so
much like nature, as to deserve universal approbation.Bernazzano painted strawberries on a wall so naturally, that, we are
told, the plaster was torn down by the frequent pecking of peacocks.Amidst these celebrated painters, these admiring judges of nature, let
us not forget our never-dying Hogarth; his piercing eye even discovers
itself in his letter to Mr.Ellis, the naturalist:--"As for your pretty
little seed cups, or vases, they are a sweet confirmation of the
pleasure nature seems to take in superadding an elegance of form to most
of her works, wherever you find them.How poor and bungling are all the
inventions of art!"[48] The very numerous works of this indefatigable writer, embracing so
many subjects, make one think he must have been as careful of his time,
as the celebrated friend of the witty _Boileau_: the humane, benevolent,
and dignified Chancellor _Aguesseau_, who finding that his wife always
kept him waiting an hour after the dinner bell had rung, resolved to
devote this time to writing a work on Jurisprudence.He put this project
in execution, and in the course of time, produced a quarto work in four
thick volumes.[49] This chesnut tree is thus noticed in a newspaper of August,
1829:--"The celebrated chesnut tree, the property of Lord Ducie, at
Tortworth, in the county of Gloucester, is the oldest, if not the
largest tree in England, having this year attained the age of 1002
years, and being 52 feet in circumference, and yet retains so much
vigour, that it bore nuts so lately as two years ago, from which young
trees are now being raised."published in 1717, called the "Lady's Recreation,"
by _Charles_ Evelyn, Esq.There are two letters subjoined, written to
this author by the Rev.From page 103, 105, 129 and 141,
one should think this was not the son of the famous Mr.Lawrence, in the Preface to his Kalendar, inserted at the
end of his fifth edition, assures the public, "that the book called the
Lady's Recreation could not be published by my approbation, because it
was never seen by me till it was in print; besides, I have reason to
think it was an artifice of the booksellers to impose upon the world,
under the borrowed name of Evelyn."[51] This sermon was preached for several years by Dr.Colin Milne, by
whom it was published in 1799, and afterwards by the Rev.Ellis, of
Merchant Taylors' School.Ellis, in his History of Shoreditch, gives
us much information as to this bequest; in which the handsome conduct of
Mr.Denne, a former vicar, is not the least interesting.of his Literary Anecdotes, bears testimony to Dr.Denne's
feeling towards the poor and distressed, and to his attachment to
literary pursuits.Three of these Sermons are in the second volume of
"Thirty Sermons on Moral and Religious Subjects, by the Rev.W. Jones, of Nayland, his Theological, Philosophical,
and Miscellaneous Works, with Life, 12 vols._neat_, 7_l._ 7_s._
6_d._ 1801.William Jones, of Nayland, Suffolk:
Chaplain to the Right Rev.George Horne, Bishop of Norwich; 1 vol.with Portrait of the Author, price 12_s._ Dove, St.John's Square,
Printer, 1828."Of this faithful servant of God, (the Rev.W. Jones) I
can speak both from personal knowledge and from his writings.He was a
man of quick penetration, of extensive learning, and the soundest piety;
and he had, beyond any other man I ever knew, the talent of writing upon
the deepest subjects to the plainest understandings."--_Bishop Horsley's
Charges._ The Rev.Samuel Ayscough, of the British Museum, began, in
1790, to preach this annual sermon, and, I believe, continued it for
fourteen years.Ellis, of _Little Gaddesden_, in his Practical Farmer, 8vo.1732, thus speaks on this subject:--"What a charming sight is a large
tree in blossom, and after that, when loaden with fruit, enough perhaps
to make a hogshead of cyder or perry!A scene of beauty, hopes, and
profit, and all!It may be on less than two feet diameter of ground.And
above all, what matter of contemplation does it afford, when we let our
thoughts descend to a single kernel of an apple or pear?And again, how
heightened, on the beholding so great a bulk raised and preserved, by
Omnipotent Power, from so small a body."[53] The thought of planting the sides of public roads, was first
suggested by the great _Sully_.Weston, in his introduction to these Tracts, seems to have
pleasure in recording the following anecdote of La Quintinye, from
Harte's Essay."The famous La Quintinie, director of the royal gardens
in France, obtained from Louis XIV.an abbacy for his son, in one of the
remote provinces; and going soon afterwards to make the abbot a visit,
(who was not then settled in his apartments) he was entertained and
lodged by a neighbouring gentleman with great friendliness and
hospitality.La Quintinie, as was natural, soon examined the gardens of
his host; he found the situation beautiful, and the soil excellent; but
every thing was rude, savage, and neglected: nature had done much, art
nothing.The guest, delighted with his friendly reception, took leave
with regret, and some months after, sent one of the king's gardeners,
and four under-gardeners, to the gentleman, with strict command to
accept of no gratuity.They took possession of his little inclosure the
moment they arrived, and having digged it many times over, they manured,
replanted it, and left one of their number behind them, as a settled
servant in the family.This young man was soon solicited to assist the
neighbourhood, and filled their kitchen gardens and fruit gardens with
the _best_ productions of every kind, which are preserved and propagated
to this very hour."_Perrault_, in
his _Hommes Illustres_, has given his Life, and Portrait.Gibson, in
his Fruit Gardener, calls him "truly an original author;" and further
pays him high compliments.thus speaks of him:--"Il vint a Paris se faire
recevoir avocat.Une eloquence naturelle, cultivee avec soin, le fit
briller dans le Barreau, et lui consila l'estime des premiers
magistrais.Quoi qu'il eut peu de temps dont il put disposer, il en
trouvoit neanmoins suffisament pour satisfaire la passion qu'il avoit
pour l'agriculture.Il augmenta ses connoissances sur le jardinage, dans
un voyage qu'il fit en Italie.De retour a Paris, il se livra tout
entier a l'agriculture, et fit un grand nombre d'experiences curieuses
et utiles.Le grand Prince de _Conde_, qui aimoit l'agriculture, prenoit
une extreme plaisir a s'entretenir avec lui; et Charles II.Roi
d'Angleterre lui offrit une pension considerable pour l'attacher a la
culture de ses Jardins, mais il refusa ses offres avantageuses par
l'amour qu'il avoit pour sa patrie, et trouva en France les recompenses
due a son merite.On a de lui un excellent livre, intitule 'Instructions
pour les Jardins Fruitiers et Potagers, Paris, 1725, 2 tom._et
plusieurs Lettres sur la meme matiere_."Switzer, in his History of
Gardening, says, that in Mons.de la Quintinye's "Two Voyages into
England, he gained considerable friendship with several lords with whom
he kept correspondence by letters till his death, and these letters,
says Perrault, are all _printed at London_."And he afterwards says,
speaking of Lord Capel's garden at Kew, "the greatest advance made by
him herein, was the bringing over several sorts of fruits from France;
and this noble lord we may suppose to be one that held for many years a
correspondence with Mons.Such letters on such
correspondence if ever printed, must be worth perusal.[55] Lamoignon de Malherbes (that excellent man) had naturalized a vast
number of foreign trees, and at the age of eighty-four, saw every where,
in France, (as Duleuze observes) plants of his own introduction.The old Earl of _Tweedale_, in the reign of Charles II.and his
immediate successor, planted more than six thousand acres, in Scotland,
with fir trees.In a Tour through Scotland, in 1753, it mentions, that
"The county of Aberdeen is noted for its timber, having in it upwards of
five millions of fir trees, besides vast numbers of other kinds, planted
within these seventy years, by the gentry at and about their seats."Marshall, in his "Planting and Rural Ornament," states, that "In
1792, his Grace the Duke of Athol (we speak from the highest authority)
was possessed of a thousand larch trees, then growing on his estates of
Dunkeld and Blair only, of not less than two to four tons of timber
each; and had, at that time, a million larches, of different sizes,
rising rapidly on his estate."The zeal for planting in Scotland, of late years, has been stimulated by
the writings of James Anderson, and Lord Kames.It is pleasing to transcribe the following paragraph from a newspaper of
the year 1819:--"Sir Watkin Williams Wynn has planted, within the last
five years, on the mountainous lands in the vicinity of Llangollen,
situated from 1200 to 1400 feet above the level of the sea, 80,000 oaks,
63,000 Spanish chesnuts, 102,000 spruce firs, 110,000 Scotch firs,
90,000 larches, 30,000 wych elms, 35,000 mountain elms, 80,000 ash, and
40,000 sycamores, all of which are, at this time, in a healthy and
thriving condition."It is impossible, on this subject, to avoid paying
a grateful respect to the memory of that bright ornament of our church,
and literature, the late Dr.Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, whose extensive
plantations, near Ambleside, have long since enriched that part.The
late Richard Crawshay (surpassed by no being during the whole course of
his very long life, for either integrity or generosity) assured the
present writer, that during an early period of Dr.Watson's planting, he
offered him, on the security of his note of hand only, and to be repaid
at his own entire convenience, ten thousand pounds, and that he (with
grateful thanks to Mr.[56] How widely different has the liberal and classic mind of Dr.Alison
viewed the rich pages of Mr.Whateley, in his deep and learned Essays on
Taste, first published nearly twenty years after Mr.One regrets that there is no Portrait of Mr.Alison,
there is a masterly one by Sir Henry Raeburn, admirably engraved by W.
Walker, of Edinburgh, in 1823.Perhaps it is one of the finest Portraits
of the present day.One is happy to perceive marks of health expressed
in his intellectually striking countenance.[57] In Biographical Anecdotes, 3 vols.appears a correspondence in
London, with Dr.Franklin, and William Whateley, and Joseph Whateley, in
1774.Temple, by a brother of Thomas
Whateley.Franklin, it appears, that
inflammatory and ill-judged letters were written by George Hutchinson,
and others, to _Thomas_ Whateley, Esq._private Secretary to Lord
Grenville_, respecting some disturbances in America, concerning Lord
Grenville's Stamp Act.On the death of Thomas, these letters were placed
in the hands of Dr.Franklin, whose duty, as agent to the colony, caused
him to transmit them to Boston.A quarrel arose between William Whateley
and Mr.Temple, as to which of them gave up those letters, and a duel
was fought.Franklin immediately cleared both those gentlemen from
all imputation.Of the celebrated interview in the council chamber,
between Mr.Franklin, an account is given by Dr.page 1. of the Monthly Magazine, and which candid
account entirely acquits Dr.Franklin from having deserved the rancorous
political acrimony of Mr.Wedderburn, whose intemperate language is
fully related in some of the Lives of Dr.Franklin, and in his Life,
published and sold by G. Nicholson, _Stourport_, 12mo.Lord Chatham spoke of Franklin in the highest strain of panegyric, when
adverting, in the year 1777, to his dissuasive arguments against the
American war.William Whateley was administrator of the goods and chattels of his
brother Thomas, who, of course, died without a will.and Political Tracts, the nineteenth
chapter consists of his account of two _Political_ Tracts, by Thomas
Whateley, Esq.and he thus concludes this chapter:--"Mr.Whateley also
wrote a tract on laying out pleasure grounds."is an
account of the quarrel and duel with Mr.It appears that Thomas Whateley died in June, 1772, and left two
brothers, William and Joseph.Debrett published "Scarce Tracts," in 4 vols.i. is one
called "The Budget," by D. Hartley, Esq.This same volume contains a
reply to this, viz."Remarks on the Budget, by Thomas Whateley, Esq.another tract by
Thomas Whateley, Esq.entitled "Considerations on the Trade and Finances
of the Kingdom."These two pamphlets, upon subjects so very different
from the alluring one on landscape gardening, and his unfinished one on
Shakspeare, convinces us, what a powerful writer he would have been, had
his life been longer spared.[58] The reader will be amply gratified by perusing page 158 of the late
Sir U. Price's well known Letter to Mr.Morris's
Observations on Water, as regards Ornamental Scenery; inserted in the
Gardener's Magazine for May, 1827.Whateley's distinction between a
river, a rivulet, and a rill, form, perhaps, five of the most seductive
pages of his book.Our own Shakspeare's imagery on this subject, should
not be overlooked:--

   The current that with gentle murmur glides,
   Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
   But when his fair course is not hindered,
   He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones,
   Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
   He overtaketh in his pilgrimage:
   And so by many winding nooks he strays
   With willing sport to the wild ocean.[59] The benevolent mind of the marquis shines even in his concluding
chapter; for he there wishes "to bring us back to a true taste for
beautiful nature--to more humane and salutary regulations of the
country--to produce the _moral_ landscapes which delight the mind.His
view of the good mother, seeing her children playing round her at their
cottage, near the common, thus "endearing her home, and making even the
air she breathed more delightful to her, make these sort of commons, to
me, the most delightful of _English gardens_.The dwellings of the happy
and peaceful husbandmen would soon rise up in the midst of compact
farms.Can there exist a more delightful habitation for man, than a neat
farm-house in the centre of a pleasing landscape?There avoiding disease
and lassitude, useless expence, the waste of land in large and dismal
parks, and above all, by preventing misery, and promoting happiness, we
shall indeed have gained the prize of having united the agreeable with
the useful.Perhaps, when every folly is exhausted, there will come a
time, in which men will be so far enlightened as to prefer the real
pleasures of nature to vanity and chimera."[60] Perhaps it may gratify those who seek for health, by their
attachment to gardens, to note the age that some of our English
horticulturists have attained to:--Parkinson died at about 78;
Tradescant, the father, died an old man; Switzer, about 80; Sir Thomas
Browne died at 77; Evelyn, at 86; Dr.Beale, at 80; Jacob Bobart, at 85;
Collinson, at 75; a son of Dr.Lawrence (equally fond of gardens as his
father) at 86; Bishop Compton, at 81; Bridgman, at an advanced age;
Knowlton, gardener to Lord Burlington, at 90; Miller, at 80; James Lee,
at an advanced age; Lord Kames, at 86; Abercrombie, at 80; the Rev.Gilpin, at 80; Duncan, a gardener, upwards of 90; Hunter, who published
_Sylva_, at 86; Speechley, at 86; Horace Walpole, at 80; Mr.Bates, the
celebrated and ancient horticulturist of High Wickham, who died there in
December, 1819, at the great age of 89; Marshall, at an advanced age;
Sir Jos.Banks, at 77; Joseph Cradock, at 85; James Dickson, at 89; Dr.Andrew Duncan, at 83; and Sir U. Price, at 83.Loudon, at page 1063
of his Encyclop.John went back to the bedroom.inform us, that a market garden, and nursery, near
Parson's Green, had been, for upwards of two centuries, occupied by a
family of the name of Rench; that one of them (who instituted the first
annual exhibition of flowers) died at the age of ninety-nine years,
having had thirty-three children; and that his son (mentioned by
Collinson, as famous for forest trees) introduced the moss-rose, planted
the elm trees now growing in the Bird-cage Walk, St.James's Park, from
trees reared in his own nursery, married two wives, had thirty-five
children, and died in 1783, in the same room in which he was born, at
the age of a hundred and one years.Reflecting on the great age of some
of the above, reminds me of what a "Journal Encyclopedique" said of
Lestiboudois, another horticulturist and botanist, who died at Lille, at
the age of ninety, and who (for even almost in our ashes _live their
wonted fires_) gave lectures in the very last year of his life."When he
had (says an ancient friend of his) but few hours more to live, he
ordered snow-drops, violets, and crocuses, to be brought to his bed, and
compared them with the figures in Tournefort.His whole existence had
been consecrated to the good of the public, and to the alleviation of
misery; thus he looked forward to his dissolution with a tranquillity of
soul that can only result from a life of rectitude; he never acquired a
fortune; and left no other inheritance to his children, but integrity
and virtue."[61] About eighty years previous to Hyll's Treatise on Bees, Rucellai,
an Italian of distinction, who aspired to a cardinal's hat, and who
laboured with zeal and taste (I am copying from De Sismondi's View of
the Literature of the South of Europe) to render Italian poetry
classical, or a pure imitation of the ancients, published his most
celebrated poem on Bees."It receives (says De Sismondi) a particular
interest from the real fondness which Rucellai seems to have entertained
for these creatures.There is something so sincere in his respect for
their virgin purity, and in his admiration of the order of their
government, that he inspires us with real interest for them.All his
descriptions are full of life and truth."[62] Ben Jonson, in his _Discourses_, gives the following eulogy on this
illustrious author:--"No member of his speech but consisted of his own
graces.His hearers could not cough or look aside from him without loss.He commanded where he spoke, and had his judges angry and pleased at his
devotion: no man had their affections more in his power; the fear of
every man that heard him was, lest he should make an end."Loudon,
when treating on the study of plants, observes, that "This wonderful
philosopher explored and developed the true foundations of human
knowledge, with a sagacity and penetration unparalleled in the history
of mankind."applied to the eight books of Hooker's
Ecclesiastical Polity, may well apply to the writings of Bacon:--"there
is no learning that this man hath not searched into.His books will get
reverence by age, for there is in them such seeds of eternity, that they
will continue till the last fire shall devour all learning."Monsieur
Thomas, in his Eulogy of Descartes, says, "Bacon explored every path of
human knowledge, he sat in judgment on past ages, and anticipated those
that were to come."The reader will be gratified by inspecting the
second volume of Mr.Malone's publication of Aubrey's Letters, in the
Bodleian Library, as well as the richly decorated and entertaining
Beauties of England and Wales, and Pennant's Tour from Chester to
London, for some curious notices of the ancient mansion, garden, and
orchard, at Gorhambury.[63] The reader will be amply gratified by Mr.Johnson's review of the
general state of horticulture at this period, in his History of English
Gardening, and with the zeal with which he records the attachment of
James I. and Charles, to this science; and where, in a subsequent
chapter, he glances on the progress of our Botany, and proudly twines
round the brows of the modest, but immortal, Ray, a most deserved and
generous wreath.[64] I subjoin a few extracts from the first book of his English
Husbandman, 4to.1635:--"A garden is so profitable, necessary, and such
an ornament and grace to every house and housekeeper, that the
dwelling-place is lame and maimed if it want that goodly limbe, and
beauty.I do not wonder either at the worke of art, or nature, when I
behold in a goodly, rich and fertill soyle, a garden adorned with all
the delights and delicacies which are within man's understanding,
because the naturall goodnesse of the earth (which not enduring to bee
idle) will bring forth whatsoever is cast into her; but when I behold
upon a barren, dry, and dejected earth, such as the Peake-hills, where a
man may behold snow all summer, or on the East-mores, whose best herbage
is nothing but mosse, and iron-stone, in such a place, I say, to behold
a delicate, rich, and fruitful garden, it shewes great worthinesse in
the owner, and infinite art and industry in the workeman, and makes mee
both admire and love the begetters of such excellencies."And again,--"For the situation of the garden-plot for pleasure, you
shall understand, that it must ever bee placed so neare unto the
dwelling-house as it is possible, both because the eye of the owner may
be a guard and support from inconveniences, as all that the especial
roomes and prospects of the house may be adorned, perfumed, and inriched
with the delicate proportions, odoriferous smells, and wholesome airs
which shall ascend and vaporate from the same."He then gives a variety of cuts of knots and mazes, and labyrinths, of
which he observes, that "many other adornations and beautifyings there
are, which belong to the setting forth of a curious garden, but for as
much as none are more rare or more esteemed than these I have set down,
being the best ornaments of the best gardens of this kingdome, I think
them tastes sufficient for every husbandman or other of better quality,
which delighteth in the beauty, and well trimming of his ground."He
thus remarks:--"as in the composition of a delicate woman, the grace of
her cheeke is the mixture of red and white, the wonder of her eye blacke
and white, and the beauty of her hand blew and white, any of which is
not said to be beautifull if it consist of single or simple colours; and
so in these walkes or alleyes the all greene, nor the all yellow cannot
be said to bee most beautifull, but the greene and yellow, (that is to
say, the untroade grasse, and the well knit gravell) being equally mixt,
give the eye both luster and delight beyond all comparison."His description of the following flower is singular: "_The Crowne
Emperiall_, is, of all flowers, both forraigne and home-bred, the
delicatest, and strangest: it hath the true shape of an imperiall
crowne, and will be of divers colours, according to the art of the
gardener.In the middest of the flower you shall see a round pearle
stand, in proportion, colour, and orientnesse, like a true naturall
pearle, only it is of a soft liquid substance: this pearle, if you shake
the flower never so violently, will not fall off, neyther if you let it
continue never so long, will it eyther encrease or diminish in the
bignesse, but remaineth all one: yet if with your finger you take and
wipe it away, in less than an hour after you shall have another arise in
the same place, and of the same bignesse.This pearle, if you taste it
upon your tongue, is pleasant, and sweet like honey: this flower when
the sunne ariseth, you shall see it looke directly to the east, with the
stalk bent lowe thereunto, and as the sunne ariseth higher and higher,
so the flower will likewise ascend, and when the sunne is come into the
meridian or noone poynt, which is directly over it, then will it stand
upright upon the stalke, and looke directly upward, and as the sunne
declineth, so will it likewise decline, and at the sunne setting looke
directly to the west only."His mention of another flower is attractive:--"Now for your _Wall
Gilliflower_, it delighteth in hard rubbish, limy, and stony grounds,
whence it commeth they covet most to grow upon walls, pavements, and
such like barraine places.It may be sowen in any moneth or season, for
it is a seed of that hardness, that it makes no difference betwixt
winter and summer, but will flourish in both equally, and beareth his
flowers all the yeere, whence it comes that the husbandman preserves it
most in his _bee-garden_, for it is _wondrous sweet_, and affordeth much
honey.It would be sowen in very small quantity, for after it hath once
taken roote, it will naturally of itself overspread much ground, and
hardly ever after be rooted out.It is of itselfe of so exceeding a
strong, and _sweet smell_, that it cannot be forced to take any other,
and therefore is ever preserved in its owne nature."of Gardening, fondly reviews the taste
for flowers which pervaded most ranks during the time of Elizabeth, and
Evelyn.The _Spectacle de la Nature_, of which we have a translation in 1740,
has a richly diffuse chapter on flowers.I here transcribe a small part
thereof:--

_Prior._ "The beauty of flowers never fails to inspire us with joy; and
when we have sufficiently examined the fairest, we are sensible they are
only proper to refresh the sight; and, indeed, the prospect they afford
is so touching, and we experience their power to be so effectual, that
the generality of those arts which are ambitious to please, seem most
successful when they borrow their assistance.Sculpture imitates them in
its softest ornaments; architecture bestows the embellishments of leaves
and festoons on those columns and fronts, which would otherwise be too
naked.The richest embroideries are little more than foliage and
flowers; the most magnificent silks are almost covered with these
charming forms, and are thought beautiful, in proportion as they
resemble the lively tinge of natural flowers."These have always been the symbols, or representations of joy; they
were formerly the inseparable ornaments of feasts, and are still
introduced with applause, toward the close of our entertainments, when
they are brought in with the fruit, to enliven the festival that begins
to languish.And they are so peculiarly adapted to scenes of pleasure,
that they are always considered as inconsistent with mourning.Decency,
informed by nature, never admits them into those places where tears and
affliction are predominant._Countess._ "The festivals in the country are never celebrated without
garlands, and the entertainments of the polite are ushered in by a
flower.If the winter denies them that gratification, they have recourse
to art.A young bride, in all the magnificence of her nuptial array,
would imagine she wanted a necessary part of her ornaments, if she did
not improve them with a sprig of flowers.A queen, amidst the greatest
solemnities, though she is covered with the jewels of the crown, has an
inclination to this rural ornament; she is not satisfied with mere
grandeur and majesty, but is desirous of assuming an air of softness and
gaiety, by the mediation of flowers._Prior._ "Religion itself, with all its simplicity and abstraction, and
amidst the abhorrence it professes to theatrical pomp, which rather
tends to dissipate the heart, than to inspire it with a due reverence
for sacred mysteries, and a sensibility of human wants, permits some of
its festivals to be celebrated with boughs, and chaplets of flowers."[66] In his Diary is the following entry:--"1658, 27 Jan.After six fits
of an ague, died my son Richard, five years and three days old onely,
but, at that tender age, a prodigy for witt and understanding; for
beauty of body, a very angel; for endowment of mind, of incredible and
rare hopes.He was all life, all prettinesse.What shall I say of his
frequent pathetical ejaculations uttered of himselfe: _Sweete Jesus,
save me, deliver me, pardon my sins, let thine angels receive me!_ So
early knowledge, so much piety and perfection!for such a child I blesse God in whose bosome he is!"Nanteuil's portrait is prefixed to his _Sylva_, 1664; and a fine copy of
the same, by Bartolozzi, is prefixed to Hunter's _Sylva_.Worlidge
engraved a fine portrait of him, prefixed to his _Sculptura_.Gaywood
engraved his portrait for the translation of _Lucretius_.In Walpole's
Anecdotes is his portrait, by Bannerman.[67] In "A Picturesque Promenade round Dorking," are selected many
interesting particulars of Mr.[68] Essex lost his head for having said that Elizabeth grew old and
cankered, and that her mind was as crooked as her carcase.Perhaps the
beauty of Mary galled Elizabeth.The Quarterly Review of July, 1828, thus remarks:--"When Elizabeth's
wrinkles waxed many, it is reported that an unfortunate master of the
Mint incurred disgrace, by a too faithful shilling; the die was broken,
and only one mutilated impression is now in existence.Her maids of
honour took the hint, and were thenceforth careful that no fragment of a
looking glass should remain in any room of the palace.In fact, the
lion-hearted lady had not heart to look herself in the face for the last
twenty years of her life."She loved Essex, of all
men, best; and yet the same axe which murdered Anne Bulleyn, was used to
revenge herself on him.The bloody task took three strokes, which so
enraged the multitude, (who loved Essex) that they would have torn the
executioner to pieces, had not the soldiers prevented them.Hutton,
in his "Journey to London," observes, that "their vengeance ought to
have been directed against the person who caused him to use it."What
her reflections were on these two bloody acts when on her death-bed, we
scarcely know.A modern writer on horticulture, nearly concludes a very
pleasing work, by enumerating (with slight historical notices) the
several plants cultivated in our gardens.He thus concludes his account
of one:--"Queen Elizabeth, in her last illness, eat little but Succory
Pottage."Loudon says it is used "as a fodder for cattle."The
French call it Chicoree _sauvage_.Her taste must have been something
like her heart.Poor Mary eat no supper the night previous to _her_ last
illness.Had it been possible for Elizabeth to have read those pages of
Robertson, which paint the long succession of calamities which befel
Mary, and the insolence and brutality she received from Darnley, and
which so eloquently plead for her frailties, perhaps even these pages
would not have softened her bloody disposition, which she seems to have
inherited from that insolent monster, her father."Mary's sufferings
(says this enchanting historian) exceed, both in degree and duration,
those tragical distresses which fancy has feigned, to excite sorrow and
commiseration; and while we survey them, we are apt altogether to forget
her frailties; we think of her faults with less indignation, and approve
of our tears as if they were shed for a person who had attained much
nearer to pure virtue.With regard to the queen's person, all
contemporary authors agree in ascribing to Mary the utmost beauty of
countenance, and elegance of shape, of which the human form is capable.Her hair was black, though, according to the fashion of that age, she
frequently borrowed locks, and of different colours.Her eyes were a
dark grey; her complexion was exquisitely fine, and her hands and arms
remarkably delicate, both as to shape and colour.Her stature was of an
height that rose to the majestic.She danced, she walked, and she rode
with equal grace.She sung, and played upon the lute with uncommon
skill."[69] I will merely give this brief extract as one out of many of great
force and beauty, from his _Salmonia_:--"If we look with wonder upon the
great remains of human works, such as the columns of Palmyra, broken in
the midst of the desert, the temples of Paestum, beautiful in the decay
of twenty centuries, or the mutilated fragments of Greek sculpture in
the Acropolis of Athens, or in our own Museum, as proofs of the genius
of artists, and power and riches of nations now past away, with how much
deeper feeling of admiration must we consider those grand monuments of
nature, which mark the revolutions of the globe; continents broken into
islands; one land produced, another destroyed; the bottom of the ocean
become a fertile soil; whole races of animals extinct; and the bones and
exuviae of one class covered with the remains of another, and upon the
graves of past generations--the marble or rocky tomb, as it were, of a
former animated world--new generations rising, and order and harmony
established, and a system of life and beauty produced, as it were, out
of chaos and death; proving the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness, of
the GREAT CAUSE OF ALL BEING!"I must trespass on my reader, by again
quoting from _Salmonia_:--"I envy no quality of the mind or intellect in
others; not genius, power, wit, or fancy; but if I could choose what
would be most delightful, and I believe most useful to me, I should
prefer _a firm religious belief_ to every other blessing; for it makes
life a discipline of goodness--creates new hopes, when all earthly hopes
vanish; and throws over the decay, the destruction of existence, the
most gorgeous of lights; awakens life even in death, and from corruption
and decay calls up beauty and divinity: makes an instrument of torture
and of shame the ladder of ascent to Paradise; and, far above all
combinations of earthly hopes, calls up the most delightful visions of
palms and amaranths, the gardens of the blest, the security of
everlasting joys, where the sensualist and the sceptic view only gloom,
decay, annihilation, and despair!"[70] In this delightful essay, he says, "the most exquisite delights of
sense are pursued, in the contrivance and plantation of gardens, which,
with fruits, flowers, shades, fountains, and the music of birds that
frequent such happy places, seem to furnish all the pleasures of the
several senses."Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, admirably
confirms this conflagration argument, by quoting the opinion or
testimony of the celebrated Goethe.[72] To this interesting subject is devoted, a part of Mr.Loudon's
concise and luminous review "Of the Rise, Progress, and Present State of
Gardening in the British Isles;" being chapter iv.[73] Perhaps there are few pages that more awfully paint the sacredness
of this spot, than page 36 in the fifth edition of Dr.[74] I do not mean to apply to the hospitable table of this reverend
gentleman, the lines of Peter Pindar:--

   One cut from _venison_, to the heart can speak,
   Stronger than ten quotations from the _Greek_.[75] I cannot prevent myself from quoting a very small portion of the
animated address of another clergyman, the Rev.J. G. Morris, as
chairman to the Wakefield Horticultural Society.I am certain each one
of my readers will blame me for not having inserted the whole of this
eloquent appeal.I copy it from the Gardener's Magazine for August,
1828:--"Conscious that I possessed no qualifications to fit me for the
task, and feeling that it ill became me to assume it, as I am as yet
nearly a stranger amongst you; aware, too, that I should be surrounded
by individuals so much more eligible, inasmuch as they are eminently
gifted with botanical science and practical knowledge, the result of
their horticultural pursuits and facilities, of which I am quite devoid;
I wished and begged to decline the proffered honour.It appears,
however, that my entreaties are not listened to, and that your kindness
and partiality persist in selecting for your chairman one so inadequate
to the situation.Gentlemen, I take the chair with much diffidence; but
I will presume to say, that, in the absence of other qualities, I bring
with me a passionate love for plants and flowers, for the sweets and
beauties of the garden, and no inconsiderable fondness for its more
substantial productions.Gardening, as a recreation and relaxation from
severer studies and more important avocations, has exquisite charms for
me; and I am ready, with old _Gerarde_, to confess, that 'the principal
delight is in the mind, singularly enriched with the knowledge of these
visible things; setting forth to us the invisible wisdom and admirable
workmanship of Almighty God.'With such predilections, you will easily
give me credit, gentlemen, for participating with this assembly in the
sincerest wishes for the complete and permanent establishment of a
society amongst us, whose object shall be to promote, in the surrounding
district, the introduction of different sorts of flowers, culinary
vegetables, fruits, improved culture and management generally, and _a
taste_ for botany as a science.These are pursuits, gentlemen, combining
at once health and innocence, pleasure and utility.Wakefield and its
vicinity appear to possess facilities for the accomplishment of such a
project, inferior to no district within this great palatinate, indeed,
little inferior to any in the kingdom.The country is beautiful and
charmingly varied, and, from the diversity of soil, suited to varied
productions; the whole thickly interspersed with seats and villas of
persons of opulence, possessing their conservatories, hot-houses, and
stoves, their orchards, flower and kitchen gardens: whilst few towns can
boast (as Wakefield can) of so many gardens within its enclosure,
cultivated with so much assiduity and skill, so much taste and deserved
success.Seven years ago, I had the honour to originate a similar
project in Preston, in Lancashire, and with the happiest success.In
that borough, possessing far less advantages than Wakefield offers, a
horticultural society was established, which, in its four annual
meetings, assembles all the rank and fashion of a circuit of more than
ten miles, and numbers more than a hundred and twenty subscribers to its
funds.Those who have not witnessed the interesting sight, can form but
a faint idea of the animating scene which is presented in a spacious and
handsome room, tastefully adorned with the choicest exotics from various
conservatories, and the more choice, because selected with a view to
competition: decorated with the varied beauties of the parterre, vieing
with each other in fragrance, hue, and delicacy of texture; whilst the
tables groan under the weight of delicious fruits and rare vegetables in
endless variety, the joint produce of hot-houses, stoves, orchards, and
kitchen gardens.Figure to yourselves, gentlemen, this elysium, graced
by some hundreds of our fair countrywomen, an absolute galaxy of
animated beauty, and that music lends its aid, and you will agree with
me that a more fascinating treat could hardly be devised.New flowers,
new fruits, recent varieties of those of long standing and established
character for excellence, are thus introduced, in lieu of those whose
inferiority is no longer doubtful.New culinary vegetables, or, from
superior treatment or mode of culture, rendered more salubrious and of
exquisite flavour, will load the stalls of our market-gardeners.I call
upon you, then, gentlemen, for your zealous support.Say not that you
have no gardens, or that your gardens are inconsiderable, or that you
are no cultivators; you are all interested in having good and delicious
fruits, nutritious and delicate culinary vegetables, and in procuring
them at a reasonable rate, which will be the results of improved and
successful cultivation.At our various exhibitions, let each contribute
that in which he excels, and our object will be attained.Gentlemen, I
fear I have trespassed too long on your patience and indulgence.I will
just urge one more motive for your warm support of our intended society;
it is this: that, by diffusing a love of plants and gardening, you will
materially contribute to the comfort and happiness of the laborious
classes; for the pleasure taken in such pursuits forms an
unexceptionable relaxation from the toils of business, and every hour
thus spent is subtracted from the ale-house and other haunts of idleness
and dissipation."[76] In the grounds of _Hagley_, were once inscribed these lines:--

   Here Pope!--ah, never must that tow'ring mind
   To his loved haunts, or dearer friend return;
   What art, what friendships!what fame resign'd:
   In yonder glade I trace his mournful urn.[77] At Holm-Lacey is preserved a sketch, in crayons, by Pope, (when on
a visit there) of Lord Strafford by Vandyke.It is well known that Pope
painted Betterton in oil colours, and gave it to Lord Mansfield.The
noble lord regretted the loss of this memorial, when his house was
consumed at the time of the disgraceful and ignorant riots.[78] Sir Joshua Reynolds used to tell the following anecdote relative to
Pope.--"When Reynolds was a young man, he was present at an auction of
very scarce pictures, which attracted a great crowd of _connoisseurs_
and others; when, in the moment of a very interesting piece being put
up, Mr.All was in an instant, from a scene of
confusion and bustle, a dead calm.The auctioneer, as if by instinct,
suspended his hammer.The audience, to an individual, as if by the same
impulse, rose up to receive the poet; and did not resume their seats
till he had reached the upper end of the room."A similar honour was paid to the Abbe Raynal, whose reputation was such,
that the Speaker of the House of Commons observing _him_ among the
spectators, suspended the business of the house till he had seen the
eloquent historian placed in a more commodious seat.It is painful to
relate, that this powerful writer, and good man, who narrowly escaped
the guillotine, expired in a garret, in extreme poverty, at the age of
eighty-four; the only property he left being one assignat of fifty
livres, worth not threepence in ready money.Perhaps one might have
applied the following anecdote (told by Dr.Drake in his Literary Hours)
to Abbe Raynal:--"A respectable character, having long figured in the
gay world at Paris, was at length compelled to live in an obscure
retreat in that city, the victim of severe misfortunes.He was so
indigent, that he subsisted only on an allowance from the parish.Every
week bread was sent to him sufficient for his support, and yet at
length, he demanded more.'With whom, sir, is it possible I should live?I am wretched, since I thus solicit charity, and am abandoned by all the
world.''But, sir, if you live alone, why do you ask for more bread than
is sufficient for yourself?'The other at last, with great reluctance,
confessed that he had a dog.The curate desired him to observe, that he
was only the distributor of the bread that belonged to the poor, and
that it was absolutely necessary that he should dispose of his dog.exclaimed the poor man, weeping, 'and if I lose my dog, who is
there then to love me?'The good pastor took his purse, and giving it to
him, 'take this, sir,' said he; 'this is mine--this I _can_ give.'"[79] How applicable are Gray's lines to Lord Byron himself, now!Can storied urn or animated bust
     Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
     Or flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?Perhaps in this _neglected_ spot is laid
     Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire!--



[80] Mr.Bowles, in some stanzas written since the death of Byron, thus
feelingly apostrophizes his noble spirit:--

   But I will bid th' Arcadian cypress wave,
     Pluck the green laurel from Peneus' side,
   And pray thy spirit may such quiet have
     That not one thought unkind be murmur'd o'er thy grave.[81] Perhaps one motive (no doubt there were numberless others) that
_might_ have induced Mr.Mason thus to honour the memory of Pope,

   ----_letting cold tears bedew his silver urn_,

_might_ have been from the recollection of his attachment to what
equally charmed Mr.[82] I know not whether Milton's portrait should have been here noticed.In a note to the eloquent, the talented, and graceful "Discours
d'Installation, prononce par M. le Vicomte H. de Thury, president de la
Societe d'Horticulture de Paris," it is beautifully observed, that
"Personne n'a mieux decrit ce delicieux jardin que Milton.Les Anglais
regardent comme le type de tous les jardins paysagers, et pittoresques,
la description que fait Milton du jardin d'Eden, et qui atteste que se
sublime genie etoit egalement poete, peintre et paysagiste."As I have
sought for the portraits of Mr.Whateley, and
have noticed those of Launcelot Brown, and Mr.Cradock, M.
R. P. Knight and Sir U. Price, who were all _paysagists_; surely our
great and severe republican was one.The Prince de Ligne speaks thus of Milton:--"les vers enchanteurs de ce
Roi des poetes, et des _jardiniers_.I do not know that every one will agree with Switzer in the concluding
part of what he says of Milton, in the History of Gardening, prefixed to
his Iconologia:--"But although things were in this terrible combustion,
we must not omit the famous Mr.John Milton, one of Cromwell's
Secretaries; who, by his excellent and never-to-be-equalled poem of
Paradise Lost, has particularly distinguished gardening, by taking that
for his theme; and shows, that though his eyes deprived him of the
benefit of seeing, yet his mind was wonderfully moved with the
philosophy, innocence, and beauty of this employ; his books, though
mixed with other subjects, being a kind of a philosophical body of
gardening, as well as divinity._had his pen been employed on
no other subject_."It must be needless reminding my reader, that Mr.Walpole's powerful pen
has taken care that our mighty poet, (who "on evil days, though fallen,
and with darkness and solitude compassed round,") shall not be
_defrauded of half his glory_.It is gratifying to remark, that an edition of Paradise Lost is now
announced for publication, in which the zeal of its spirited proprietors
has determined, that every word shall be printed in letters of gold.The
sanction of some of our most distinguished divines, and men of high
rank, evince the pride with which we all acknowledge the devout zeal and
mighty powers of the blind poet.Garrick's fondness for ornamental gardening, induced him finely
to catch at this invention, in his inimitable performance of Lord
Chalkstone.Pulteney relates this anecdote of Mr.Miller: "He was the only
person I ever knew who remembered to have seen Mr.I shall not
easily forget the pleasure that enlightened his countenance, it so
strongly expressed the _Virgilium tantum vidi_, when, in speaking of
that revered man, he related to me that incident of his youth."Ray only meditated a work to have been entitled _Horti_ Angliae.Had he written it, I should have felt a singular pride in introducing
his valued name in the present imperfect volume.[85] The generous minded reader will be gratified by referring to the
kind tribute, paid to the memory of Shenstone, by Mr.Johnson, in his History
of Gardening, thus speaks:--"Taken as a whole, it is the most complete
book of gardening ever published;"--and that, with the exception of
chymistry, "every art and science, at all illustrative of gardening, are
made to contribute their assistance."[86] In his "Unconnected Thoughts" he admires the _Oak_, for "its
majestic appearance, the rough grandeur of its bark, and the wide
protection of its branches: a large, branching, aged oak, is, perhaps,
the most venerable of all inanimate objects."[87] Tea was the favourite beverage of Dr.When Hanway
pronounced his anathema against it, Johnson rose in defence of it,
declaring himself "in that article a hardened sinner, having for years
diluted my meals with the infusion of that fascinating plant; my
tea-kettle has had no time to cool; with tea I have solaced the midnight
hour, and with tea welcomed the morning."Pennant was a great lover
of tea; a hardy honest Welch parson, on hearing that he usually retired
in the afternoon to his summer-house to enjoy that beverage, was moved
with indignation, that any thing weaker than ale or wine should be drunk
there; and calling to mind the good hunting times of old, passionately
exclaimed, "his father would have scorned it."[88] Sir Uvedale thus expresses his own sensations when viewing some of
these plantations:--"The inside fully answers to the dreary appearance
of the outside; of all dismal scenes it seems to me the most likely for
a man to hang himself in; he would, however, find some difficulty in the
execution, for amidst the endless multitude of stems, there is rarely a
single side branch to which a rope could be fastened.The whole wood is
a collection of tall naked poles.... Even its gloom is without
solemnity; it is only dull and dismal; and what light there is, like
that of hell,

   _Serves only to discover scenes of woe,
   Regions of sorrow, doleful shades._"



[89] This observation confirms what Sir U. Price so pointedly enforces
throughout the whole of his causticly sportive letter to Mr.Repton:
"that the best landscape painters would be the best landscape gardeners,
were they to turn their minds to the practical part; consequently, a
study of their works, the most useful study to an improver."--And that
"Van Huysum would be a much better judge of the merits and defects of
the most dressed scene--of a mere flower garden,--than a gardener."Browne was not an author; yet the title of the present volume
is "On the Portraits of English _Authors_ on Gardening."Neither was old
Bridgman nor Kent _authors_ on this subject; still I could not prevail
on myself to pass over such names in total silence.Clive resided at Moreton-Say, near Market-Drayton.He was a
prebend of Westminster.In
his village, scarcely a poor man existed.His kindness and benevolence
to the poor, could only be equalled by his friendly hospitality and kind
feeling to the more affluent in his neighbourhood:

   _Thy works, and alms, and all thy good endeavour,
   Follow thee up to joy and bliss for ever._

Miss Seward thus concludes one of her letters to him:--"I wish none were
permitted to enter the lists of criticism but those who feel poetic
beauty as keenly as yourself, and who have the same generous desire that
others should feel it."Clive with gratitude, from a
recollection of kindnesses received from him at a very early period of
my life, and which were of such a nature, as could not fail to animate
the mind of a young man to studious exertions.Archdeacon Plimley (now
the truly venerable Archdeacon Corbet, and who has been so long an
honour to his native county), in his Agricultural Survey of Shropshire,
respectfully introduces Mr.Clive's name; and when he addressed his
charge to the diocese of Hereford, in 1793, one really cannot but apply
to Mr.Clive, what he so eloquently enforces in that charge to each
clergyman:--"to cultivate a pure spirit within their own bosoms; to be
in every instance the right-hand neighbour to each parishioner; their
private adviser, their public monitor, their example in christian
conduct, their joy in health, their consolation in sickness."Archdeacon Clive, lies buried Robert Lord Clive,
conqueror of _Plassy_: on whose death appeared these extempore lines, by
a man of distinction, a friend to Lord Clive:--

   Life's a surface, slippery, glassy,
   Whereon tumbled Clive of Plassy;
   All the wealth the east could give,
   Brib'd not death to let him live:
   There's no distinction in the grave
   'Twixt the nabob and the slave.His lordship's death, in 1774, was owing to the same cause which
hastened that of the most worthy of men, Sir Samuel Romilly--from
shattered and worn out nerves;--from severe study in the latter, and
from the burning climate of the east in the former.Had Lord Clive lived
a few years longer, he would have enriched the whole neighbourhood round
his native spot.His vigorous, ardently-gifted, and penetrating mind,
projected plantations and other improvements, that could only have been
conceived by such minds as Olivier de Serres, or by Sully, or by our own
Evelyn.He was generous, social and
friendly; and if ever charity to the poor warmed the breast of any
mortal, it warmed that of Lord Clive.Few men had more kind affections
than Lord Clive.[92] The following passage from a favourite book of Dr.Darwin's, (the
System of Nature, by Linnaeus) will well apply to that searching and
penetrating mind, which so strongly possessed him through life.--"How
small a part of the great works of nature is laid open to our eyes, and
how many things are going on in secret which we know nothing of!How
many things are there which this age first was acquainted with!How many
things that we are ignorant of will come to light when all memory of us
shall be no more!for nature does not at once reveal all her secrets.We
are apt to look on ourselves as already admitted into the sanctuary of
her temple; we are still only in the porch."How full of grace, of
tenderness, and passion, is that elegy, which he composed the night he
feared a life he so passionately loved (Mrs.Pole, of Radburn,) was in
imminent danger, and when he dreamed she was dead:

   Stretch'd on her sable bier, the grave beside,
     A snow-white shroud her breathless bosom bound,
   O'er her white brow the _mimic lace_ was tied,
     And loves, and virtues, hung their garlands round.From these cold lips did softest accents flow?Round that pale mouth did sweetest dimples play?On this dull cheek the rose of beauty blow,
     And those dim eyes diffuse celestial rays?Did this cold hand unasking want relieve,
     Or wake the lyre to every rapturous sound?How sad, for other's woes, this breast could heave!How light this heart, for other's transport, bound![93] It was at this period of his residence at Lichfield, that the
present writer heard him strongly enforce the cultivation of _papaver
somniferum_.What he may have also enforced to others, may possibly have
given rise to some of those ingenious papers on its cultivation, which
are inserted not only in the Transactions of the Society for the
Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce; in other publications,
but in the first and fifth volumes of the Memoirs of the Caledonian
Horticultural Society.Jones, on its
cultivation, in the former of these transactions, are particularly
diffuse and valuable.The subjoined plate is a copy of that in the title page to
"_Opiologia_, ou traicte concernant le naturel proprietes, vraye
preparation, et seur vsage de l'opium," a favourite volume with Dr.Darwin, printed at _la Haye_, 1614, 12mo.Darwin, in his Botanical
Garden, thus speaks of opium: "the finest opium is procured by wounding
the heads of large poppies with a three-edged knife, and tying
muscle-shells to them, to catch the drops.In small quantities it
exhilirates the mind, raises the passions, and invigorates the body; in
large ones, it is succeeded by intoxication, languor, stupor, and
death."[94] _Sterne_ mentions a traveller who always set out with the spleen
and jaundice,--"without one generous connection, or pleasurable anecdote
to tell of,--travelling straight on, looking neither to his right hand
or his left, lest love or pity should seduce him out of the road."Loudon seems to be a very different kind of a traveller: for his
horticultural spirit and benevolent views, pervade almost every page of
his late tour through _Bavaria_.One envies his feelings, too, in
another rural excursion, through the romantic scenery of _Bury_, at Mr.Hope's at _Deepdene_; and particularly when he
paints his own emotions on viewing the room of sculpture there.He even
could not, in October last, take his rural ride from _Edgware_ to _St.Alban's_ without thus awakening in each traveller a love of gardens, and
giving this gentle hint to an honest landlord:--"A new inn, in the
outskirts of _St.Alban's_, in the _Dunstable_ road, has an ample
garden, not made the most of.Such a piece of ground, and a gardener of
taste, would give an inn, so situated, so great a superiority, that
_every one would be tempted to stop there_; but the garden of this
Boniface, exhibits but the beginning of a good idea."When travelling
along our English roads, his mind no doubt frequently reverts to those
road-side gardens in the Netherlands, which he thus happily adverts to
in p.32 of his Encyclopaedia: "The gardens of the cottagers in these
countries, are undoubtedly better managed and more productive than those
of any other country; no man who has a cottage is without a garden
attached; often small, but rendered useful to a poor family, by the high
degree of culture given to it."Linnaeus, in his eloquent oration at
Upsal, enforces the pleasure of travelling in one's own country, through
its fields _and roads_.Heath, the zealous and affectionate
historian of Monmouth, in his account of that town and its romantic
neighbourhood, (published in 1804,) omits no opportunity of noticing the
many neat gardens, which add to the other rural charms of its rich
scenery, thus mentions another Boniface:--"The late Thomas Moxley, who
kept the public-house at Manson Cross, was a person that took great
delight in fruit-trees, and had a large piece of ground let him, for the
purpose of planting it with apple-trees; but his death (which followed
soon after) prevented the plan from being carried to the extent he
intended, though some of the land bears evidence of his zeal and
labour."Heath cannot even travel on the turnpike road, from
Monmouth to Hereford, without benevolently remarking, that "a number of
laborious families have erected small tenements, with a garden to each,
most of which are thickly planted with apple-trees, whose produce
considerably adds to the owner's support."[95] Of this celebrated biographer of Dr.Darwin (whose Verses to the
Memory of Mr.Garrick, and whose Monody on Captain Cook, will live as
long as our language is spoken,) Sir W. Scott thus describes his first
personal interview with:--"Miss Seward, when young, must have been
exquisitely beautiful; for, in advanced age, the regularity of her
features, the fire and expression of her countenance, gave her the
appearance of beauty, and almost of youth.Her eyes were auburn, of the
precise shade and hue of her hair, and possessed great expression.In
reciting, or in speaking with animation, they appeared to become darker;
and, as it were, to flash fire.I should have hesitated to state the
impression which this peculiarity made upon me at the time, had not my
observation been confirmed by that of the first actress of this or any
other age, with whom I lately happened to converse on our deceased
friend's expressive powers of countenance."[96] From one of these pleasing sermons I extract these few
lines:--"Among the most pleasing sights of a country village, is that of
a father and mother, followed by their family of different ages, issuing
from their little dwelling on a Sunday morning, as the bell tolls to
church.The children, with their ruddy, wholesome looks, are all neat
and clean.Their behaviour at church shews what an impression their
parents have given them of the holiness of the place, and of the duties
they have to perform.Though unregarded, as they return home, by their
richer neighbours, they carry back with them to their humble cottage the
blessing of God.--Pious parents!lead on your children from church to
heaven.an account of
some of the most remarkable places in North Wales.de Voltaire was so charmed with the taste and talents, and
polite engaging manners of La Fage, that he paid him the following
compliment; which may very justly be applied to Mr.Cradock:

   _Il recut deux presens des Dieux,
   Les plus charmans qu'ils puissent faire;
   L'un etoit le talent de plaire,
   L'autre le secret d'etre heureux._



[99] The Quarterly Review for April, 1821, observes, that "The total
number of exotics, introduced into this country, appears to be 11,970,
of which the first forty-seven species, including the orange, apricot,
pomegranate, &c. were introduced previously or during the reign of Henry
VIII., and no fewer than 6756 in the reign of George III.For this proud
accession to our exotic botany in the last century, the public are
chiefly indebted to Sir Joseph Banks, and Messrs.Lee and Kennedy, of
the Hammersmith nursery."[100] The invocation to this Vale, reminds one of Mr.Repton's
description:--"Downton Vale, near Ludlow, one of the most beautiful and
romantic valleys that the imagination can conceive.It is impossible by
description to convey an idea of its natural charms, or to do justice to
that taste which has displayed these charms to the greatest advantage,

   _With art clandestine, and conceal'd design._

A narrow, wild, and natural path, sometimes creeps under the beetling
rock, close by the margin of a mountain stream.It sometimes ascends to
an awful precipice, from whence the foaming waters are heard roaring in
the dark abyss below, or seen wildly dashing against its opposite banks;
while, in other places, the course of the river _Teme_ being impeded by
natural ledges of rock, the vale presents a calm, glassy mirror, that
reflects the surrounding foliage.The path, in various places, crosses
the water by bridges of the most romantic and contrasted forms; and,
branching in various directions, including some miles in length, is
occasionally varied and enriched by caves and cells, hovels, and covered
seats, or other buildings, in perfect harmony with the wild but pleasing
horrors of the scene."[101] Foxley, this far-famed seat of dignified and benevolent
retirement, has on many occasions become interesting.It gave a peaceful asylum to Benjamin Stillingfleet, when
his mind was depressed by disappointment.The then owner, Robert Price,
Esq.and his mild and amiable lady, both kindly pressed him to become an
inmate of their domestic retreat, that his health might be restored, and
his mind calmed; and though he modestly refused being a constant
intruder, yet he took up his residence in a cottage near them, and
delighted to pass his leisure hours in their happy domestic circle,
"blending his studious pursuits, with rural occupations," and
particularly with gardening.No doubt, to this protecting kindness, may,
on this spot, have been imbibed his great veneration for Theophrastus;
and here he must have laid the foundation of those attainments, which,
during the future periods of his life, obtained for him the high
approbation of the justly celebrated Mrs.Montagu, who, in her letters,
speaks of "this invaluable friend," in the highest possible terms of
praise.In this peaceful and consoling retreat, was written his original
and masterly tribute to the talents of Xenophon; and here was first
kindled his deep enthusiastic zeal for the classic authors of antiquity;
and the materials for his then intended edition of Milton (who he says
equalled all the ancients whom he imitated; the sublimity of Homer, the
majesty of Sophocles, the softness of Theocritus, and the gaiety of
Anacreon,) enriched with parallel passages from holy writ, the classics,
and the early Italian poets; and here he composed his matchless treatise
on the power and principles of Tartini's music (for it seems Mr.Price
himself "was a master of the art.")Here too, most probably, he
sketched, or first gathered, his early memoranda towards his future
general history of husbandry, from the earliest ages of the world to his
own time; and fostered a devoted zeal for Linnaeus, which produced that
spirited eulogium on him, which pervades the preface to his translation
of "Miscellaneous Tracts on Natural History."[102] Sir Uvedale, about fifty years ago, translated _Pausanias_ from
the Greek.One may judge of the feeling with which he dwelt on the pages
of this book, by what he says of that nation in vol.65 of his
Essays, where he speaks of being struck with the extreme richness of
some of the windows of our cathedrals and ruined abbeys: "I hope it will
not be supposed, that by admiring the picturesque circumstances of the
Gothic, I mean to undervalue the symmetry and beauty of Grecian
buildings: whatever comes to us from the Greeks, has an irresistible
claim to our admiration; that distinguished people seized on the true
points both of beauty and grandeur in all the arts, and their
architecture has justly obtained the same high pre-eminence as their
sculpture, poetry, and eloquence."[103] On the pomp of devotion in our ancient abbeys, Mr.R. P. Knight
thus interests his readers, in the chapter "Of the Sublime and
Pathetic," in the Inquiry into the principles of Taste:--"Every person
who has attended the celebration of high mass, at any considerable
ecclesiastical establishment, must have felt how much the splendour and
magnificence of the Roman Catholic worship tends to exalt the spirit of
devotion, and to inspire the soul with rapture and enthusiasm.Not only
the impressive melody of the vocal and instrumental music, and the
imposing solemnity of the ceremonies, but the pomp and brilliancy of the
sacerdotal garments, and the rich and costly decorations of the altar,
raise the character of religion, and give it an air of dignity and
majesty unknown to any of the reformed churches."he thus adverts to the effects of
the levelling system of Launcelot Browne:--"From this influence of
fashion, and the particular influence of Mr.Browne, models of old
gardens are in this country still scarcer in nature than in painting;
and therefore what good parts there may be in such gardens, whether
proceeding from original design, or from the changes produced by time
and accident, can no longer be observed; and yet, from these specimens
of ancient art, however they may be condemned as old fashioned, many
hints might certainly be taken, and blended with such modern
improvements as really deserve the name."--"Were my arguments in favour
of many parts of the old style of gardening ever so convincing, the most
I could hope from them at present, would be, to produce _some caution_;
and to assist in preserving some of the few remains of old magnificence
that still exist, by making the owner less ready to listen to a
professor, whose interest it is to recommend total demolition."R.
P. Knight, in a note to his _landscape_, thus remarks on this subject:
"I remember a country clock-maker, who being employed to clean a more
complex machine than he had been accustomed to, very confidently took it
to pieces; but finding, when he came to put it together again, some
wheels of which he could not discover the use, very discreetly carried
them off in his pocket.The simple artifice of this prudent mechanic,
always recurs to my mind, when I observe the manner in which our modern
improvers repair and embellish old places; not knowing how to employ the
terraces, mounds, avenues, and other features which they find there,
they take them all away, and cover the places which they occupied with
turf.It is a short and easy method of proceeding; and if their
employers will be satisfied with it, they are not to be blamed for
persevering in it, as it may be executed by proxy, as well as in
person."Severely (and no doubt justly), as the too generally smooth and
monotonous system of Mr.Browne has been condemned, yet he must have had
great merit to have obtained the many encomiums he did obtain from some
of our first nobility and gentry.The _evil_ which he did in many of
their altered pleasure-grounds, _lives after him--the good is oft
interred in his grave_.George Mason justly observes that "Nature's favourite haunts
are the school of gardening."Chrysostom said of Xenophon, that "he had something of
witchcraft in his writings."It would not be too much to say the same of
this poet.He has said often that they were the happiest hours of his
life.That was their greatest pleasure, going off together after duck or
snipe along the Maryland waters.Well, they grew rich and began to know
people; and then they met a girl.It seems they both thought a great
deal of her, as half the New York men did, I am told; and she was the
reigning belle and toast, and had other admirers, and neither met with
that favor she showed--well, the man she married, for instance.But for
a while each thought, for some reason or other, that he was especially
favored.Lockwood never spoke of it
to me.But they both fell very deeply in love with her, and each thought
the other disloyal, and so they quarrelled; and--and then, though the
woman married, the two men kept apart.It was the one great passion
of their lives, and both were proud, and each thought the other in the
wrong, and so they have kept apart ever since.And--well, I believe that
is all."Miss Catherwaight had listened in silence and with one little gloved
hand tightly clasping the other.Latimer, indeed," she began, tremulously, "I am terribly
ashamed of myself.I seemed to have rushed in where angels fear to
tread.Of course I might
have known there was a woman in the case, it adds so much to the story.But I suppose I must give up my medal.I never could tell that story,
could I?""No," said young Latimer, dryly; "I wouldn't if I were you."Something in his tone, and something in the fact that he seemed to avoid
her eyes, made her drop the lighter vein in which she had been speaking,
and rise to go.There was much that he had not told her, she suspected,
and when she bade him good-by it was with a reserve which she had not
shown at any other time during their interview.she murmured, as young Latimer turned
from the brougham door and said "Home," to the groom.She thought about
it a great deal that afternoon; at times she repented that she had given
up the medal, and at times she blushed that she should have been carried
in her zeal into such an unwarranted intimacy with another's story.She determined finally to ask her father about it.He would be sure to
know, she thought, as he and Mr.Then
she decided finally not to say anything about it at all, for Mr.Catherwaight did not approve of the collection of dishonored honors
as it was, and she had no desire to prejudice him still further by a
recital of her afternoon's adventure, of which she had no doubt but he
would also disapprove.So she was more than usually silent during
the dinner, which was a tete-a-tete family dinner that night, and she
allowed her father to doze after it in the library in his great chair
without disturbing him with either questions or confessions.{Illustration with caption: "What can Mr.Lockwood be calling upon me
about?"}They had been sitting there some time, he with his hands folded on the
evening paper and with his eyes closed, when the servant brought in a
card and offered it to Mr.Catherwaight fumbled
over his glasses, and read the name on the card aloud: "'Mr.Miss Catherwaight sat upright, and reached out for the card with a
nervous, gasping little laugh."Oh, I think it must be for me," she said; "I'm quite sure it is
intended for me.I was at his office to-day, you see, to return him some
keepsake of his that I found in an old curiosity shop.Something with
his name on it that had been stolen from him and pawned.You needn't go down, dear; I'll see him.It was I he asked for,
I'm sure; was it not, Morris?"Morris was not quite sure; being such an old gentleman, he thought it
must be for Mr.He did not like to disturb
his after-dinner nap, and he settled back in his chair again and
refolded his hands."I hardly thought he could have come to see me," he murmured, drowsily;
"though I used to see enough and more than enough of Lewis Lockwood
once, my dear," he added with a smile, as he opened his eyes and nodded
before he shut them again."That was before your mother and I were
engaged, and people did say that young Lockwood's chances at that time
were as good as mine.He was very attentive,
though; _very_ attentive."Miss Catherwaight stood startled and motionless at the door from which
she had turned.she asked quickly, and in a very low voice.Catherwaight did not deign to open his eyes this time, but moved his
head uneasily as if he wished to be let alone."To your mother, of course, my child," he answered; "of whom else was I
speaking?"Miss Catherwaight went down the stairs to the drawing-room slowly, and
paused half-way to allow this new suggestion to settle in her mind.There was something distasteful to her, something that seemed not
altogether unblamable, in a woman's having two men quarrel about her,
neither of whom was the woman's husband.And yet this girl of whom
Latimer had spoken must be her mother, and she, of course, could do no
wrong.It was very disquieting, and she went on down the rest of the way
with one hand resting heavily on the railing and with the other pressed
against her cheeks.It now seemed to her very
sad indeed that these two one-time friends should live in the same city
and meet, as they must meet, and not recognize each other.She argued
that her mother must have been very young when it happened, or she would
have brought two such men together again.Her mother could not have
known, she told herself; she was not to blame.For she felt sure that
had she herself known of such an accident she would have done something,
said something, to make it right.And she was not half the woman her
mother had been, she was sure of that.There was something very likable in the old gentleman who came forward
to greet her as she entered the drawing-room; something courtly and of
the old school, of which she was so tired of hearing, but of which she
wished she could have seen more in the men she met.Latimer
had accompanied his guardian, exactly why she did not see, but she
recognized his presence slightly.He seemed quite content to remain in
the background.Lockwood, as she had expected, explained that he had
called to thank her for the return of the medal.He had it in his hand
as he spoke, and touched it gently with the tips of his fingers as
though caressing it."I knew your father very well," said the lawyer, "and I at one time had
the honor of being one of your mother's younger friends.That was before
she was married, many years ago."He stopped and regarded the girl
gravely and with a touch of tenderness."You will pardon an old man, old
enough to be your father, if he says," he went on, "that you are greatly
like your mother, my dear young lady--greatly like.Your mother was
very kind to me, and I fear I abused her kindness; abused it by
misunderstanding it.There was a great deal of misunderstanding; and
I was proud, and my friend was proud, and so the misunderstanding
continued, until now it has become irretrievable."He had forgotten her presence apparently, and was speaking more to
himself than to her as he stood looking down at the medal in his hand."You were very thoughtful to give me this," he continued; "it was very
good of you.I don't know why I should keep it though, now, although I
was distressed enough when I lost it.But now it is only a reminder of
a time that is past and put away, but which was very, very dear to me.Perhaps I should tell you that I had a misunderstanding with the friend
who gave it to me, and since then we have never met; have ceased to
know each other.But I have always followed his life as a judge and as a
lawyer, and respected him for his own sake as a man.I cannot tell--I do
not know how he feels toward me."The old lawyer turned the medal over in his hand and stood looking down
at it wistfully.The cynical Miss Catherwaight could not stand it any longer.Lockwood," she said, impulsively, "Mr.Latimer has told me why
you and your friend separated, and I cannot bear to think that it
was she--my mother--should have been the cause.She could not have
understood; she must have been innocent of any knowledge of the trouble
she had brought to men who were such good friends of hers and to each
other.It seems to me as though my finding that coin is more than a
coincidence.I somehow think that the daughter is to help undo the harm
that her mother has caused--unwittingly caused.Keep the medal and don't
give it back to me, for I am sure your friend has kept his, and I am
sure he is still your friend at heart.Don't think I am speaking hastily
or that I am thoughtless in what I am saying, but it seems to me as if
friends--good, true friends--were so few that one cannot let them go
without a word to bring them back.But though I am only a girl, and a
very light and unfeeling girl, some people think, I feel this very
much, and I do wish I could bring your old friend back to you again as I
brought back his pledge.""It has been many years since Henry Burgoyne and I have met," said the
old man, slowly, "and it would be quite absurd to think that he still
holds any trace of that foolish, boyish feeling of loyalty that we once
had for each other.Yet I will keep this, if you will let me, and I
thank you, my dear young lady, for what you have said.I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.You are as good and as kind as your mother was,
and--I can say nothing, believe me, in higher praise."He rose slowly and made a movement as if to leave the room, and then,
as if the excitement of this sudden return into the past could not
be shaken off so readily, he started forward with a move of sudden
determination."I think," he said, "I will go to Henry Burgoyne's house at once,
to-night.I will see if this has
or has not been one long, unprofitable mistake.If my visit should
be fruitless, I will send you this coin to add to your collection of
dishonored honors, but if it should result as I hope it may, it will be
your doing, Miss Catherwaight, and two old men will have much to thank
you for.Good-night," he said as he bowed above her hand, "and--God
bless you!"Miss Catherwaight flushed slightly at what he had said, and sat looking
down at the floor for a moment after the door had closed behind him.Latimer moved uneasily in his chair.The routine of the office
had been strangely disturbed that day, and he now failed to recognize
in the girl before him with reddened cheeks and trembling eyelashes the
cold, self-possessed young woman of society whom he had formerly known."You have done very well, if you will let me say so," he began, gently."I hope you are right in what you said, and that Mr.Lockwood will not
meet with a rebuff or an ungracious answer.Why," he went on quickly, "I
have seen him take out his gun now every spring and every fall for the
last ten years and clean and polish it and tell what great shots he and
Henry, as he calls him, used to be.And then he would say he would take
a holiday and get off for a little shooting.He would
put the gun back into its case again and mope in his library for days
afterward.You see, he never married, and though he adopted me, in a
manner, and is fond of me in a certain way, no one ever took the place
in his heart his old friend had held.""You will let me know, will you not, at once,--to-night, even,--whether
he succeeds or not?""You can
understand why I am so deeply interested.I see now why you said I
would not tell the story of that medal.But, after all, it may be the
prettiest story, the only pretty story I have to tell."Lockwood had not returned, the man said, when young Latimer reached
the home the lawyer had made for them both.He did not know what to
argue from this, but determined to sit up and wait, and so sat smoking
before the fire and listening with his sense of hearing on a strain for
the first movement at the door.The front door shut with a clash, and he heard
Mr.Lockwood crossing the hall quickly to the library, in which he
waited.Then the inner door was swung back, and Mr.Lockwood came in
with his head high and his eyes smiling brightly.There was something in his step that had not been there before,
something light and vigorous, and he looked ten years younger.He
crossed the room to his writing-table without speaking and began tossing
the papers about on his desk.Then he closed the rolling-top lid with a
snap and looked up smiling."I shall have to ask you to look after things at the office for a little
while," he said."Judge Burgoyne and I are going to Maryland for a few
weeks' shooting."VAN BIBBER AND THE SWAN-BOATS


It was very hot in the Park, and young Van Bibber, who has a good heart
and a great deal more money than good-hearted people generally get, was
cross and somnolent.He had told his groom to bring a horse he wanted to
try to the Fifty-ninth Street entrance at ten o'clock, and the groom had
not appeared.He waited as long as his dignity would allow, and then turned off into
a by-lane end dropped on a bench and looked gloomily at the Lohengrin
swans with the paddle-wheel attachment that circle around the lake.They struck him as the most idiotic inventions he had ever seen, and he
pitied, with the pity of a man who contemplates crossing the ocean to
be measured for his fall clothes, the people who could find delight in
having some one paddle them around an artificial lake.Two little girls from the East Side, with a lunch basket, and an older
girl with her hair down her back, sat down on a bench beside him and
gazed at the swans.The place was becoming too popular, and Van Bibber decided to move on.But the bench on which he sat was in the shade, and the asphalt walk
leading to the street was in the sun, and his cigarette was soothing,
so he ignored the near presence of the three little girls, and remained
where he was."I s'pose," said one of the two little girls, in a high, public school
voice, "there's lots to see from those swan-boats that youse can't see
from the banks.""Oh, lots," assented the girl with long hair."If you walked all round the lake, clear all the way round, you could
see all there is to see," said the third, "except what there's in the
middle where the island is.""I guess it's mighty wild on that island," suggested the youngest."Eddie Case he took a trip around the lake on a swan-boat the other day.He said youse could see fishes and ducks, and
that it looked just as if there were snakes and things on the island."asked the other one, in a hushed voice."Well, wild things," explained the elder, vaguely; "bears and animals
like that, that grow in wild places."Van Bibber lit a fresh cigarette, and settled himself comfortably and
unreservedly to listen."My, but I'd like to take a trip just once," said the youngest,
under her breath.Then she clasped her fingers together and looked up
anxiously at the elder girl, who glanced at her with severe reproach.Ain't you having a good time
'nuff without wishing for everything you set your eyes on?"Van Bibber wondered at this--why humans should want to ride around on
the swans in the first place, and why, if they had such a wild desire,
they should not gratify it."Why, it costs more'n it costs to come all the way up town in an open
car," added the elder girl, as if in answer to his unspoken question.The younger girl sighed at this, and nodded her head in submission, but
blinked longingly at the big swans and the parti- awning and the
red seats."I beg your pardon," said Van Bibber, addressing himself uneasily to
the eldest girl with long hair, "but if the little girl would like to go
around in one of those things, and--and hasn't brought the change with
her, you know, I'm sure I should be very glad if she'd allow me to send
her around."exclaimed the little girl, with a jump, and so sharply
and in such a shrill voice that Van Bibber shuddered."I'm afraid maw wouldn't like our taking money from any one we didn't
know," she said with dignity; "but if you're going anyway and want
company--"

"Oh!my, no," said Van Bibber, hurriedly.He tried to picture himself
riding around the lake behind a tin swan with three little girls from
the East Side, and a lunch basket."Then," said the head of the trio, "we can't go."There was such a look of uncomplaining acceptance of this verdict on
the part of the two little girls, that Van Bibber felt uncomfortable.He
looked to the right and to the left, and then said desperately,
"Well, come along."The young man in a blue flannel shirt, who did the
paddling, smiled at Van Bibber's riding-breeches, which were so very
loose at one end and so very tight at the other, and at his gloves
and crop.The three little girls
placed the awful lunch basket on the front seat and sat on the middle
one, and Van Bibber cowered in the back.They were hushed in silent
ecstasy when it started, and gave little gasps of pleasure when it
careened slightly in turning.It was shady under the awning, and the
motion was pleasant enough, but Van Bibber was so afraid some one would
see him that he failed to enjoy it.But as soon as they passed into the narrow straits and were shut in by
the bushes and were out of sight of the people, he relaxed, and began to
play the host.He pointed out the fishes among the rocks at the edges
of the pool, and the sparrows and robins bathing and ruffling
their feathers in the shallow water, and agreed with them about the
possibility of bears, and even tigers, in the wild part of the island,
although the glimpse of the gray helmet of a Park policeman made such a
supposition doubtful.And it really seemed as though they were enjoying it more than he
ever enjoyed a trip up the Sound on a yacht or across the ocean on a
record-breaking steamship.It seemed long enough before they got back to
Van Bibber, but his guests were evidently but barely satisfied.Still,
all the goodness in his nature would not allow him to go through that
ordeal again.He stepped out of the boat eagerly and helped out the girl with long
hair as though she had been a princess and tipped the rude young man
who had laughed at him, but who was perspiring now with the work he had
done; and then as he turned to leave the dock he came face to face with
A Girl He Knew and Her brother.Her brother said, "How're you, Van Bibber?Been taking a trip around
the world in eighty minutes?"And added in a low voice, "Introduce me to
your young lady friends from Hester Street.""Ah, how're you--quite a surprise!"gasped Van Bibber, while his late
guests stared admiringly at the pretty young lady in the riding-habit,
and utterly refused to move on."Been taking ride on the lake,"
stammered Van Bibber; "most exhilarating.Young friends of mine--these
young ladies never rode on lake, so I took 'em."Oh, yes, we saw you," said Her brother, dryly, while she only smiled at
him, but so kindly and with such perfect understanding that Van Bibber
grew red with pleasure and bought three long strings of tickets for the
swans at some absurd discount, and gave each little girl a string."There," said Her brother to the little ladies from Hester Street, "now
you can take trips for a week without stopping.Don't try to smuggle in
any laces, and don't forget to fee the smoking-room steward."The Girl He Knew said they were walking over to the stables, and that
he had better go get his other horse and join her, which was to be his
reward for taking care of the young ladies.And the three little girls
proceeded to use up the yards of tickets so industriously that they were
sunburned when they reached the tenement, and went to bed dreaming of
a big white swan, and a beautiful young gentleman in patent-leather
riding-boots and baggy breeches.VAN BIBBER'S BURGLAR


There had been a dance up town, but as Van Bibber could not find Her
there, he accepted young Travers's suggestion to go over to Jersey City
and see a "go" between "Dutchy" Mack and a <DW52> person professionally
known as the Black Diamond.They covered up all signs of their evening
dress with their great-coats, and filled their pockets with cigars, for
the smoke which surrounds a "go" is trying to sensitive nostrils, and
they also fastened their watches to both key-chains.Alf Alpin, who was
acting as master of ceremonies, was greatly pleased and flattered
at their coming, and boisterously insisted on their sitting on the
platform.The fact was generally circulated among the spectators that
the "two gents in high hats" had come in a carriage, and this and their
patent-leather boots made them objects of keen interest.It was even
whispered that they were the "parties" who were putting up the money
to back the Black Diamond against the "Hester Street Jackson."This in
itself entitled them to respect.Van Bibber was asked to hold the watch,
but he wisely declined the honor, which was given to Andy Spielman, the
sporting reporter of the _Track and Ring_, whose watch-case was covered
with diamonds, and was just the sort of a watch a timekeeper should
hold.It was two o'clock before "Dutchy" Mack's backer threw the sponge
into the air, and three before they reached the city.They had another
reporter in the cab with them besides the gentleman who had bravely
held the watch in the face of several offers to "do for" him; and as
Van Bibber was ravenously hungry, and as he doubted that he could get
anything at that hour at the club, they accepted Spielman's invitation
and went for a porterhouse steak and onions at the Owl's Nest, Gus
McGowan's all-night restaurant on Third Avenue.It was a very dingy, dirty place, but it was as warm as the engine-room
of a steamboat, and the steak was perfectly done and tender.It was
too late to go to bed, so they sat around the table, with their chairs
tipped back and their knees against its edge.The two club men had
thrown off their great-coats, and their wide shirt fronts and silk
facings shone grandly in the smoky light of the oil lamps and the
red glow from the grill in the corner.They talked about the life the
reporters led, and the Philistines asked foolish questions, which the
gentleman of the press answered without showing them how foolish they
were."And I suppose you have all sorts of curious adventures," said Van
Bibber, tentatively."Well, no, not what I would call adventures," said one of the reporters."I have never seen anything that could not be explained or attributed
directly to some known cause, such as crime or poverty or drink.You may
think at first that you have stumbled on something strange and romantic,
but it comes to nothing.You would suppose that in a great city like
this one would come across something that could not be explained away
something mysterious or out of the common, like Stevenson's Suicide
Club.Dickens once told James Payn that the
most curious thing he ever saw In his rambles around London was a ragged
man who stood crouching under the window of a great house where the
owner was giving a ball.While the man hid beneath a window on the
ground floor, a woman wonderfully dressed and very beautiful raised the
sash from the inside and dropped her bouquet down into the man's hand,
and he nodded and stuck it under his coat and ran off with it."I call that, now, a really curious thing to see.But I have never come
across anything like it, and I have been in every part of this big city,
and at every hour of the night and morning, and I am not lacking in
imagination either, but no captured maidens have ever beckoned to me
from barred windows nor 'white hands waved from a passing hansom.'Balzac and De Musset and Stevenson suggest that they have had such
adventures, but they never come to me.It is all commonplace and vulgar,
and always ends in a police court or with a 'found drowned' in the North
River."McGowan, who had fallen into a doze behind the bar, woke suddenly and
shivered and rubbed his shirt-sleeves briskly.A woman knocked at the
side door and begged for a drink "for the love of heaven," and the man
who tended the grill told her to be off.They could hear her feeling
her way against the wall and cursing as she staggered out of the alley.Three men came in with a hack driver and wanted everybody to drink
with them, and became insolent when the gentlemen declined, and were
in consequence hustled out one at a time by McGowan, who went to sleep
again immediately, with his head resting among the cigar boxes and
pyramids of glasses at the back of the bar, and snored."You see," said the reporter, "it is all like this.Night in a great
city is not picturesque and it is not theatrical.It is sodden,
sometimes brutal, exciting enough until you get used to it, but it runs
in a groove.It is dramatic, but the plot is old and the motives and
characters always the same."The rumble of heavy market wagons and the rattle of milk carts told
them that it was morning, and as they opened the door the cold fresh
air swept into the place and made them wrap their collars around
their throats and stamp their feet.The morning wind swept down the
cross-street from the East River and the lights of the street lamps and
of the saloon looked old and tawdry.Travers and the reporter went off
to a Turkish bath, and the gentleman who held the watch, and who had
been asleep for the last hour, dropped into a nighthawk and told the
man to drive home.It was almost clear now and very cold, and Van Bibber
determined to walk.He had the strange feeling one gets when one stays
up until the sun rises, of having lost a day somewhere, and the dance
he had attended a few hours before seemed to have come off long ago, and
the fight in Jersey City was far back in the past.The houses along the cross-street through which he walked were as dead
as so many blank walls, and only here and there a lace curtain waved out
of the open window where some honest citizen was sleeping.The street
was quite deserted; not even a cat or a policeman moved on it and Van
Bibber's footsteps sounded brisk on the sidewalk.There was a great
house at the corner of the avenue and the cross-street on which he was
walking.The house faced the avenue and a stone wall ran back to the
brown stone stable which opened on the side street.There was a door
in this wall, and as Van Bibber approached it on his solitary walk it
opened cautiously, and a man's head appeared in it for an instant and
was withdrawn again like a flash, and the door snapped to.Van Bibber
stopped and looked at the door and at the house and up and down the
street.The house was tightly closed, as though some one was lying
inside dead, and the streets were still empty.Van Bibber could think of nothing in his appearance so dreadful as to
frighten an honest man, so he decided the face he had had a glimpse of
must belong to a dishonest one.It was none of his business, he assured
himself, but it was curious, and he liked adventure, and he would
have liked to prove his friend the reporter, who did not believe in
adventure, in the wrong.So he approached the door silently, and jumped
and caught at the top of the wall and stuck one foot on the handle of
the door, and, with the other on the knocker, drew himself up and looked
cautiously down on the other side.He had done this so lightly that the
only noise he made was the rattle of the door-knob on which his foot had
rested, and the man inside thought that the one outside was trying to
open the door, and placed his shoulder to it and pressed against it
heavily.Van Bibber, from his perch on the top of the wall, looked down
directly on the other's head and shoulders.He could see the top of the
man's head only two feet below, and he also saw that in one hand he
held a revolver and that two bags filled with projecting articles of
different sizes lay at his feet.It did not need explanatory notes to tell Van Bibber that the man below
had robbed the big house on the corner, and that if it had not been for
his having passed when he did the burglar would have escaped with his
treasure.His first thought was that he was not a policeman, and that a
fight with a burglar was not in his line of life; and this was followed
by the thought that though the gentleman who owned the property in the
two bags was of no interest to him, he was, as a respectable member of
society, more entitled to consideration than the man with the revolver.The fact that he was now, whether he liked it or not, perched on the top
of the wall like Humpty Dumpty, and that the burglar might see him
and shoot him the next minute, had also an immediate influence on his
movements.So he balanced himself cautiously and noiselessly and dropped
upon the man's head and shoulders, bringing him down to the flagged walk
with him and under him.The revolver went off once in the struggle, but
before the burglar could know how or from where his assailant had come,
Van Bibber was standing up over him and had driven his heel down on his
hand and kicked the pistol out of his fingers.Then he stepped quickly
to where it lay and picked it up and said, "Now, if you try to get up
I'll shoot at you."He felt an unwarranted and ill-timedly humorous
inclination to add, "and I'll probably miss you," but subdued it.The
burglar, much to Van Bibber's astonishment, did not attempt to rise, but
sat up with his hands locked across his knees and said: "Shoot ahead.His teeth were set and his face desperate and bitter, and hopeless to a
degree of utter hopelessness that Van Bibber had never imagined."Go ahead," reiterated the man, doggedly, "I won't move.Van Bibber felt the pistol loosening
in his hand, and he was conscious of a strong inclination to lay it down
and ask the burglar to tell him all about it."You haven't got much heart," said Van Bibber, finally."You're a pretty
poor sort of a burglar, I should say.""I won't go back--I won't go
back there alive.I've served my time forever in that hole.If I have to
go back again--s'help me if I don't do for a keeper and die for it.But
I won't serve there no more."asked Van Bibber, gently, and greatly interested; "to
prison?"cried the man, hoarsely: "to a grave.Look at my face," he said, "and look at my hair.That ought to tell you
where I've been.With all the color gone out of my skin, and all the
life out of my legs.I couldn't hurt you if
I wanted to.I'm a skeleton and a baby, I am.And
now you're going to send me back again for another lifetime.For twenty
years, this time, into that cold, forsaken hole, and after I done my
time so well and worked so hard."Van Bibber shifted the pistol from one
hand to the other and eyed his prisoner doubtfully.he asked, seating himself on the steps
of the kitchen and holding the revolver between his knees.The sun was
driving the morning mist away, and he had forgotten the cold."I got out yesterday," said the man.Van Bibber glanced at the bags and lifted the revolver."You didn't
waste much time," he said."No," answered the man, sullenly, "no, I didn't.I knew this place and
I wanted money to get West to my folks, and the Society said I'd have to
wait until I earned it, and I couldn't wait.I haven't seen my wife
for seven years, nor my daughter.Seven years, young man; think of
that--seven years.Seven years without
seeing your wife or your child!And they're straight people, they are,"
he added, hastily."My wife moved West after I was put away and took
another name, and my girl never knew nothing about me.I was to join 'em,
and I thought I could lift enough here to get the fare, and now," he
added, dropping his face in his hands, "I've got to go back.And I had
meant to live straight after I got West,--God help me, but I did!An' I don't care whether you believe
it or not neither," he added, fiercely."I didn't say whether I believed it or not," answered Van Bibber, with
grave consideration.He eyed the man for a brief space without speaking, and the burglar
looked back at him, doggedly and defiantly, and with not the faintest
suggestion of hope in his eyes, or of appeal for mercy.Perhaps it was
because of this fact, or perhaps it was the wife and child that moved
Van Bibber, but whatever his motives were, he acted on them promptly."I
suppose, though," he said, as though speaking to himself, "that I ought
to give you up.""I'll never go back alive," said the burglar, quietly."Well, that's bad, too," said Van Bibber."Of course I don't know
whether you're lying or not, and as to your meaning to live honestly, I
very much doubt it; but I'll give you a ticket to wherever your wife is,
and I'll see you on the train.And you can get off at the next station
and rob my house to-morrow night, if you feel that way about it.Throw
those bags inside that door where the servant will see them before the
milkman does, and walk on out ahead of me, and keep your hands in your
pockets, and don't try to run.The man placed the bags inside the kitchen door; and, with a doubtful
look at his custodian, stepped out into the street, and walked, as he
was directed to do, toward the Grand Central station.Van Bibber kept
just behind him, and kept turning the question over in his mind as to
what he ought to do.He felt very guilty as he passed each policeman,
but he recovered himself when he thought of the wife and child who lived
in the West, and who were "straight."asked Van Bibber, as he stood at the ticket-office window."Helena, Montana," answered the man with, for the first time, a look of
relief.Van Bibber bought the ticket and handed it to the burglar."I
suppose you know," he said, "that you can sell that at a place down town
for half the money.""Yes, I know that," said the burglar.There was a
half-hour before the train left, and Van Bibber took his charge into the
restaurant and watched him eat everything placed before him, with his
eyes glancing all the while to the right or left.Then Van Bibber gave
him some money and told him to write to him, and shook hands with him.The man nodded eagerly and pulled off his hat as the car drew out of
the station; and Van Bibber came down town again with the shop girls and
clerks going to work, still wondering if he had done the right thing.He went to his rooms and changed his clothes, took a cold bath, and
crossed over to Delmonico's for his breakfast, and, while the waiter
laid the cloth in the cafe, glanced at the headings in one of the
papers.He scanned first with polite interest the account of the dance
on the night previous and noticed his name among those present.With
greater interest he read of the fight between "Dutchy" Mack and the
"Black Diamond," and then he read carefully how "Abe" Hubbard, alias
"Jimmie the Gent," a burglar, had broken jail in New Jersey, and had
been traced to New York.There was a description of the man, and Van
Bibber breathed quickly as he read it."The detectives have a clew of
his whereabouts," the account said; "if he is still in the city they are
confident of recapturing him.But they fear that the same friends who
helped him to break jail will probably assist him from the country or to
get out West.""They may do that," murmured Van Bibber to himself, with a smile of grim
contentment; "they probably will."Then he said to the waiter, "Oh, I don't know.Some bacon and eggs and
green things and coffee."VAN BIBBER AS BEST MAN


Young Van Bibber came up to town in June from Newport to see his lawyer
about the preparation of some papers that needed his signature.He found
the city very hot and close, and as dreary and as empty as a house that
has been shut up for some time while its usual occupants are away in the
country.As he had to wait over for an afternoon train, and as he was down town,
he decided to lunch at a French restaurant near Washington Square, where
some one had told him you could get particular things particularly well
cooked.The tables were set on a terrace with plants and flowers about
them, and covered with a tricolored awning.There were no jangling
horse-car bells nor dust to disturb him, and almost all the other tables
were unoccupied.The waiters leaned against these tables and chatted in
a French argot; and a cool breeze blew through the plants and billowed
the awning, so that, on the whole, Van Bibber was glad he had come.There was, beside himself, an old Frenchman scolding over his late
breakfast; two young artists with Van <DW18> beards, who ordered the most
remarkable things in the same French argot that the waiters spoke; and a
young lady and a young gentleman at the table next to his own.The young
man's back was toward him, and he could only see the girl when the youth
moved to one side.She was very young and very pretty, and she seemed in
a most excited state of mind from the tip of her wide-brimmed, pointed
French hat to the points of her patent-leather ties.She was strikingly
well-bred in appearance, and Van Bibber wondered why she should be
dining alone with so young a man."It wasn't my fault," he heard the youth say earnestly."How could I
know he would be out of town?Your
cousin is not the only clergyman in the city.""Of course not," said the girl, almost tearfully, "but they're not my
cousins and he is, and that would have made it so much, oh, so very much
different."Runaway couple," commented Van Bibber.Read about
'em often; never seen 'em.He bent his head over an entree, but he could not help hearing what
followed, for the young runaways were indifferent to all around them,
and though he rattled his knife and fork in a most vulgar manner, they
did not heed him nor lower their voices."Well, what are you going to do?"said the girl, severely but not
unkindly."It doesn't seem to me that you are exactly rising to the
occasion.""Well, I don't know," answered the youth, easily.Nobody we know ever comes here, and if they did they are out of
town now.You go on and eat something, and I'll get a directory and look
up a lot of clergymen's addresses, and then we can make out a list and
drive around in a cab until we find one who has not gone off on his
vacation.We ought to be able to catch the Fall River boat back at
five this afternoon; then we can go right on to Boston from Fall River
to-morrow morning and run down to Narragansett during the day.""They'll never forgive us," said the girl."Oh, well, that's all right," exclaimed the young man, cheerfully."Really, you're the most uncomfortable young person I ever ran away
with.One might think you were going to a funeral.You were willing
enough two days ago, and now you don't help me at all.he asked, and then added, "but please don't say so, even if you are.""No, not sorry, exactly," said the girl; "but, indeed, Ted, it is going
to make so much talk.If we only had a girl with us, or if you had a
best man, or if we had witnesses, as they do in England, and a parish
registry, or something of that sort; or if Cousin Harold had only been
at home to do the marrying."The young gentleman called Ted did not look, judging from the expression
of his shoulders, as if he were having a very good time.He picked at the food on his plate gloomily, and the girl took out her
handkerchief and then put it resolutely back again and smiled at him.The youth called the waiter and told him to bring a directory, and as he
turned to give the order Van Bibber recognized him and he recognized Van
Bibber.Van Bibber knew him for a very nice boy, of a very good Boston
family named Standish, and the younger of two sons.It was the elder who
was Van Bibber's particular friend.The girl saw nothing of this mutual
recognition, for she was looking with startled eyes at a hansom that had
dashed up the side street and was turning the corner."Standish," said Van Bibber, jumping up and reaching for his hat, "pay
this chap for these things, will you, and I'll get rid of your brother."Van Bibber descended the steps lighting a cigar as the elder Standish
came up them on a jump."Wait a minute; where are you
going?Why, it seems to rain Standishes to-day!First see your brother;
then I see you.Van Bibber answered these different questions to the effect that he had
seen young Standish and Mrs.Standish not a half an hour before, and
that they were just then taking a cab for Jersey City, whence they were
to depart for Chicago."The driver who brought them here, and who told me where they were, said
they could not have left this place by the time I would reach it," said
the elder brother, doubtfully."That's so," said the driver of the cab, who had listened curiously."I
brought 'em here not more'n half an hour ago.Just had time to get back
to the depot."Yes, but they have," said Van Bibber."However, if you get over to
Jersey City in time for the 2.30, you can reach Chicago almost as soon
as they do.They are going to the Palmer House, they said.""Thank you, old fellow," shouted Standish, jumping back into his hansom.Nobody objected to the
marriage, only too young, you know."Don't mention it," said Van Bibber, politely."Now, then," said that young man, as he approached the frightened couple
trembling on the terrace, "I've sent your brother off to Chicago.I
do not know why I selected Chicago as a place where one would go on a
honeymoon.But I'm not used to lying and I'm not very good at it.Now,
if you will introduce me, I'll see what can be done toward getting you
two babes out of the woods."Standish said, "Miss Cambridge, this is Mr.Cortlandt Van Bibber, of
whom you have heard my brother speak," and Miss Cambridge said she
was very glad to meet Mr.Van Bibber even under such peculiarly trying
circumstances."Now what you two want to do," said Van Bibber, addressing them as
though they were just about fifteen years old and he were at least
forty, "is to give this thing all the publicity you can."chorused the two runaways, in violent protest."You were about to make a fatal mistake.You were about to go to some unknown clergyman of an unknown parish,
who would have married you in a back room, without a certificate or
a witness, just like any eloping farmer's daughter and lightning-rod
agent.Why you were not married
respectably in church I don't know, and I do not intend to ask, but
a kind Providence has sent me to you to see that there is no talk nor
scandal, which is such bad form, and which would have got your names
into all the papers.I am going to arrange this wedding properly, and
you will kindly remain here until I send a carriage for you.Now just
rely on me entirely and eat your luncheon in peace.It's all going to
come out right--and allow me to recommend the salad, which is especially
good."Van Bibber first drove madly to the Little Church Around the Corner,
where he told the kind old rector all about it, and arranged to have
the church open and the assistant organist in her place, and a
district-messenger boy to blow the bellows, punctually at three o'clock."And now," he soliloquized, "I must get some names.It doesn't matter
much whether they happen to know the high contracting parties or not,
but they must be names that everybody knows.Whoever is in town will be
lunching at Delmonico's, and the men will be at the clubs."So he first
went to the big restaurant, where, as good luck would have it, he found
Mrs."Regy" Van Arnt and Mrs."Jack" Peabody, and the Misses Brookline,
who had run up the Sound for the day on the yacht _Minerva_ of the
Boston Yacht Club, and he told them how things were and swore them to
secrecy, and told them to bring what men they could pick up.At the club he pressed four men into service who knew everybody and whom
everybody knew, and when they protested that they had not been properly
invited and that they only knew the bride and groom by sight, he told
them that made no difference, as it was only their names he wanted.Then
he sent a messenger boy to get the biggest suit of rooms on the Fall
River boat and another one for flowers, and then he put Mrs."Regy" Van
Arnt into a cab and sent her after the bride, and, as best man, he got
into another cab and carried off the groom."I have acted either as best man or usher forty-two times now," said Van
Bibber, as they drove to the church, "and this is the first time I ever
appeared in either capacity in russia-leather shoes and a blue serge
yachting suit.But then," he added, contentedly, "you ought to see the
other fellows.One of them is in a striped flannel.""Regy" and Miss Cambridge wept a great deal on the way up town, but
the bride was smiling and happy when she walked up the aisle to meet her
prospective husband, who looked exceedingly conscious before the eyes of
the men, all of whom he knew by sight or by name, and not one of whom he
had ever met before.But they all shook hands after it was over, and
the assistant organist played the Wedding March, and one of the club men
insisted in pulling a cheerful and jerky peal on the church bell in the
absence of the janitor, and then Van Bibber hurled an old shoe and a
handful of rice--which he had thoughtfully collected from the chef at
the club--after them as they drove off to the boat."Now," said Van Bibber, with a proud sigh of relief and satisfaction, "I
will send that to the papers, and when it is printed to-morrow it will
read like one of the most orthodox and one of the smartest weddings of
the season.And yet I can't help thinking--"

"Well?""Regy," as he paused doubtfully."Well, I can't help thinking," continued Van Bibber, "of Standish's
older brother racing around Chicago with the thermometer at 102 in the
shade.I wish I had only sent him to Jersey City.It just shows," he
added, mournfully, "that when a man is not practised in lying, he should
leave it alone."Beauregard rested hopes upon a fresh dispatch announcing that Buell was
delayed and the dreaded junction of two Federal armies therefore
impossible.Meanwhile Grant and Buell were together in Sherman's camp and
it was decided that Buell's troops should attack Beauregard next morning.One division of Buell stood to arms all night.At the break of day on Monday, April 7th, all was astir in both camps on
the field of Shiloh, and the dawn was greeted with the roar of cannon.The
troops that Grant now advanced into the contest were all, except about ten
thousand, the fresh recruits that Wallace and Buell had brought, while the
Confederates had not a single company that had not been on the ground the
day before.Some military historians believe that Beauregard would have
won a signal victory if neither army had been reenforced during the night.But now under the changed conditions the Confederates were at a great
disadvantage, and yet they fought for eight long hours with heroic valor.The deafening roar of the cannon that characterized the beginning of the
day's battle was followed by the rattle of musketry, so continuous that no
ear could distinguish one shot from another.Nelson's division of Buell's
army was the first to engage the Confederates.Nelson commanded the
Federal left wing, with Hardee and Breckinridge immediately opposed to
him.The Union center was under the command of Generals McCook and
Crittenden; the right wing was commanded by McClernand, with Hurlbut next,
while Sherman and Lew Wallace occupied the extreme right.The Confederate
left wing was commanded by the doughty Bragg and next to him was General
Polk.Shiloh Church was again the storm center and in it General Beauregard
made his headquarters.Hour after hour the columns in blue and gray surged
to and fro, first one then the other gaining the advantage and presently
losing it.At times the smoke of burning powder enveloped the whole field
and hid both armies from view.The interesting incidents of this day of
blood would fill a volume.General Hindman of the Southern side had a
novel experience.His horse was struck by a bursting shell and torn to a
thousand fragments.The general, thrown ten feet high, fell to the ground,
but leaped to his feet unhurt and asked for another horse.Early in the afternoon, Beauregard became convinced that he was fighting a
losing battle and that it would be the part of prudence to withdraw the
army before losing all.He thereupon sent the members of his staff to the
various corps commanders ordering them to prepare to retreat from the
field, at the same time making a show of resuming the offensive.The
retreat was so skilfully made, the front firing-line being kept intact,
that the Federals did not suspect it for some time.Some hours before
nightfall the fighting had ceased.The Federals remained in possession of
the field and the Confederates were wading through the mud on the road to
Corinth.It was a dreary march for the bleeding and battered Confederate army.An
eye-witness described it in the following language:

"I made a detour from the road on which the army was retreating that I
might travel faster and get ahead of the main body.In this ride of twelve
miles alongside of the routed army, I saw more of human agony and woe than
I trust I will ever again be called upon to witness.The retreating host
wound along a narrow and almost impassable road, extending some seven or
eight miles in length.Here was a line of wagons loaded with wounded,
piled in like bags of grain, groaning and cursing; while the mules plunged
on in mud and water belly-deep, the water sometimes coming into the
wagons.Next came a straggling regiment of infantry, pressing on past the
wagons; then a stretcher borne on the shoulders of four men, carrying a
wounded officer; then soldiers staggering along, with an arm broken and
hanging down, or other fearful wounds, which were enough to destroy life.And, to add to the horrors of the scene, the elements of heaven marshaled
their forces--a fitting accompaniment of the tempest of human desolation
and passion which was raging.A cold, drizzling rain commenced about
nightfall, and soon came harder and faster, then turned to pitiless,
blinding hail.I passed
long wagon trains filled with wounded and dying soldiers, without even a
blanket to shelter them from the driving sleet and hail, which fell in
stones as large as partridge eggs, until it lay on the ground two inches
deep."Some three hundred men died during that awful retreat, and their bodies
were thrown out to make room for others who, although wounded, had
struggled on through the storm, hoping to find shelter, rest, and medical
care."Four days after the battle, however, Beauregard reported to his
government, "this army is more confident of ultimate success than before
its encounter with the enemy."Addressing the soldiers, he said: "You have
done your duty.... Your countrymen are proud of your deeds on the bloody
field of Shiloh; confident in the ultimate result of your valor."The news of these two fearful days at Shiloh was astounding to the
American people.Never before on the continent had there been anything
approaching it.Bull Run was a skirmish in comparison with this gigantic
conflict.The losses on each side exceeded ten thousand men.General Grant
tells us that after the second day he saw an open field so covered with
dead that it would have been possible to walk across it in any direction
stepping on dead bodies, without a foot touching the ground.American
valor was tried to the full on both sides at Shiloh, and the record shows
that it was equal to the test.[Illustration: GENERAL A. S. JOHNSTON, C. S.A brilliant Southern leader, whose early loss was a hard blow to the
Confederacy, Albert Sidney Johnston was a born fighter with a natural
genius for war.A West Pointer of the Class of '26, he had led a strenuous
and adventurous life.In the early Indian wars, in the border conflicts in
Texas, and in the advance into Mexico, he had always proved his worth, his
bravery and his knowledge as a soldier.At the outbreak of the Civil War
he had already been brevetted Brigadier-General, and had been commander of
the military district of Utah.An ardent Southerner, he made his choice,
dictated by heart and conscience, and the Federal authorities knew the
loss they would sustain and the gain that would be given to the cause of
the Confederacy.In '61 he was assigned to a district including Kentucky
and Tennessee with the rank of General.At once he displayed his gifts as
an organizer, but Shiloh cut short a career that would have led him to a
high place in fame and history.The early Confederate successes of the 6th
of April were due to his leadership.His manner of death and his way of
meeting it attested to his bravery.Struck by a minie ball, he kept in the
saddle, falling exhausted and dying from the loss of blood.His death put
the whole South into mourning.[Illustration: CAMP OF THE NINTH MISSISSIPPI.Southern soldiers in shirtsleeves a few months before they fought bravely

To no one who was close to him in the stirring scenes of the early
conflict in the West did Grant pay higher tribute than to this veteran of
the Mexican War who was his Chief of Staff.He was a man to be relied upon
in counsel and in emergency, a fact that the coming leader recognized from
the very outset.An artillery officer and engineer, his military training
and practical experience made him a most valuable executive.He had also
the gift of leading men and inspiring confidence.Always cool and
collected in the face of danger, and gifted with a personality that won
friends everywhere, the reports of all of his superiors show the trust and
confidence that were reposed in him.In April, 1861, he had taken charge
of the fortifications at Cairo, Illinois.He was with Grant at Paducah, at
Forts Henry and Donelson, and at Shiloh where he collected the artillery
near the Landing that repelled the final Confederate attack on April 6th.He remained Chief of Staff until October, 1862.On October 14th, he was
made a Brigadier-General of Volunteers, and was appointed superintendent
of military railroads in the Department of Tennessee.Later he was Chief
of Staff to General Sherman, and again proved his worth when he was with
General Thomas at Hood's defeat before Nashville in December, 1864.On
March 13, 1865, he received the brevet of Major-General of Volunteers.[Illustration: WAITING FOR THE SMELL OF POWDER--CONFEDERATES BEFORE SHILOH

PITTSBURG LANDING--A FEW DAYS AFTER THE BATTLE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]By the name of "Pittsburg Landing," this Tennessee River point,
Southerners designate the conflict of April 6 and 7, 1862.The building
upon the left and one farther up the bank were the only ones standing at
the time of the battle.Of the six steamers, the name of the _Tycoon_,
which brought hospital supplies from the Cincinnati branch of the Sanitary
Commission, is visible.Johnston's plan in the attack on the Federal
forces was to pound away on their left until they were driven away from
the Landing and huddled in the angle between the Tennessee River and Snake
Creek.The onset of the Confederates was full of dash.Sherman was at
length driven from Shiloh Church, and the command of Prentiss was
surrounded and forced to surrender.It looked as if Johnston would crush
the left.Just at this point he was struck down by a minie-ball from the
last line of a Federal force that he had victoriously driven back.The
success of the day now begins to tell on the Confederate army.But the men in gray push vigorously toward the
point where these boats lie anchored.Some heavy guns are massed near this
point.Reenforcements are arriving across the river, but General
Beauregard, who succeeds Johnston in command, suspends the battle till the
morrow.During the night 24,000 fresh troops are taken across the river by
the transports here pictured.They successfully withstand the attempt of
Beauregard, and with the arrival of Lew Wallace from up the river victory
shifts to the Stars and Stripes.THE GUNBOATS AT SHILOH

In the river near Pittsburg Landing, where the Federal transports lay,
were two small gunboats, and what they did during the battle of April 6th
makes a separate chapter in the action.In the early morning they were out
of sight, though within sound of the continuous firing.How the battle was
going, however, was evident.The masses of the blue-clad troops appeared
through the trees on the river bank, showing that under the continuous and
fierce assaults they were falling back upon the Landing.The _Tyler_,
commanded by Lieutenant Gwin, and afterward the _Lexington_, commanded by
Lieutenant Shirk, which arrived at four o'clock, strove to keep the
Confederate army from the Landing.After the surrender of Prentiss,
General Withers set his division in motion to the right toward this point.Chalmers' and Jackson's brigades marched into the ravine of Dill's Branch
and into the range of the Federal gunboats and batteries which silenced
Gage's battery, the only one Withers had, and played havoc with the
Confederate skirmishers.All the rest of the afternoon, until nightfall,
the river sailors kept up their continuous bombardment, and in connection
with the field batteries on the bank checked General Withers' desperate
attempt on the Landing.The dauntless brigade of Chalmers, whose brave
Southerners held their ground near the foot of the ravine and maintained
the conflict after the battle was ended elsewhere, was swept by the
gunboats' fire.When Buell's army, that had been hurrying up to Grant's
assistance, reached the battle-field, Gwin sent a messenger ashore in the
evening to General Nelson, who had just arrived, and asked in what manner
he could now be of service.It was pitch dark; except for the occasional
firing of the pickets the armies were resting after the terrific combat.In reply to Gwin's inquiry, General Nelson requested that the gunboats
keep on firing during the night, and that every ten minutes an 8-inch
shell should be launched in the direction of the Confederate camp.With
great precision Gwin followed out this course.Through the forest the
shells shrieked and exploded over the exhausted Confederates, showering
branches and limbs upon them where they slept, and tearing great gashes in
the earth.The result was that they got little rest, and rest was
necessary.Slowly a certain demoralization became evident--results that
bore fruit in the action that opened on the morrow.Here we see
pictured--in the lower part of the page--the captain's gig and crew near
the _Lexington_, ready to row their commander out into the stream.[Illustration: THE _LEXINGTON_]

[Illustration: FOURTEENTH IOWA VETERANS

AT LIBBY PRISON, RICHMOND, IN 1862, ON THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In the battle of Shiloh the Fourteenth Iowa Infantry formed part of that
self-constituted forlorn hope which made the victory of April 7, 1862,
possible.It held the center at the "Hornet's Nest," fighting the
live-long day against fearful odds.Just as the sun was setting, Colonel
William T. Shaw, seeing that he was surrounded and further resistance
useless, surrendered the regiment.These officers and men were held as
prisoners of war until October 12, 1862, when, moving by Richmond,
Virginia, and Annapolis, Maryland, they went to Benton Barracks, Missouri,
being released on parole, and were declared exchanged on the 19th of
November.This photograph was taken while they were held at Richmond,
opposite the cook-houses of Libby Prison.The third man from the left in
the front row, standing with his hand grasping the lapel of his coat, is
George Marion Smith, a descendant of General Marion of Revolutionary fame.It is through the courtesy of his son, N. H. Smith, that this photograph
appears here.The Fourteenth Iowa Infantry was organized at Davenport and
mustered in November 6, 1861.At Shiloh the men were already veterans of
Forts Henry and Donelson.Those who were not captured fought in the battle
of Corinth, and after the prisoners were exchanged they took part in the
Red River expedition and several minor engagements.They were mustered out
November 16, 1864, when the veterans and recruits were consolidated in two
companies and assigned to duty in Springfield, Illinois, till August,
1865.These two companies were mustered out on August 8th.The regiment
lost during service five officers and fifty-nine enlisted men killed and
mortally wounded, and one officer and 138 enlisted men by disease.Iowa
sent nine regiments of cavalry, four batteries of light artillery and
fifty-one regiments of infantry to the Union armies, a grand total of
76,242 soldiers.[Illustration: THE MOUNTED POLICE OF THE WEST.]Stalwart horsemen such as these bore the brunt of keeping order in the
turbulent regions fought over by the armies in the West.The bugle call,
"Boots and Saddles!"might summon them to fight, or to watch the movements
of the active Confederates, Van Dorn and Price.It was largely due to
their daring and bravery that the Confederate forces were held back from
the Mississippi so as not to embarrass the movements of Grant and the
gunboats.Of this unattached cavalry of the Army of the Ohio were the men
in the upper picture--Company D, Fourth Kentucky Volunteers, enlisted at
Louisville, December, 1861.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE FOURTH KENTUCKY CAVALRY.][Illustration: THE FLEET THAT CLEARED THE RIVER

COPYRIGHT, 1911."A spear-thrust in the back" was delivered to the Confederacy by the
inland-river fleet that cut it in two.The squadron of Flag-Officer Davis
is here lying near Memphis.Thus appeared the Federal gunboats on June 5,
1862, two miles above the city.Fort Pillow had been abandoned the
previous day, but the Confederate river-defense flotilla still remained
below and the Federals, still smarting from the disaster inflicted on the
"Cincinnati," were determined to bring on a decisive engagement and, if
possible, clear the river of their antagonists.Meanwhile four new vessels
had joined the Federal squadron.These were river steamers which Charles
Ellet, Jr., had converted into rams in the short space of six weeks.Their
principle was as old as history, but it was now to be tried for the first
time in aid of the Federal cause.On these heights above the river the
inhabitants of Memphis were crowded on the morning of June 6, 1862, as the
Federal squadron moved down-stream against the Confederate gunboats that
were drawn up in double line of battle opposite the city.Everyone wanted
to see the outcome of the great fight that was impending, for if its
result proved adverse to the Confederates, Memphis would fall into Federal
hands and another stretch of the Mississippi would be lost to the South.In the engagement at Memphis two of the Ellet rams accompanied the
squadron--the "Queen of the West" commanded by Charles Ellet, and the
"Monarch" commanded by his younger brother, Major Alfred Ellet.The
Confederate flotilla was destroyed, but with the loss of Charles Ellet,
from a mortal wound.[Illustration: MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE ON THE HEIGHTS]

[Illustration: A LOCOMOTIVE THAT HANGED EIGHT MEN AS SPIES

COPYRIGHT, 1911.In April, 1862, J. J. Andrews, a citizen of Kentucky and a spy in General
Buell's employment, proposed seizing a locomotive on the Western and
Atlantic Railroad at some point below Chattanooga and running it back to
that place, cutting telegraph wires and burning bridges on the way.General O. M. Mitchel authorized the plan and twenty-two men volunteered
to carry it out.On the morning of April 12th, the train they were on
stopped at Big Shanty station for breakfast.The bridge-burners (who were
in citizens' clothes) detached the locomotive and three box-cars and
started at full speed for Chattanooga, but after a run of about a hundred
miles their fuel was exhausted and their pursuers were in sight.Andrews was condemned as a spy and hanged at Atlanta,
July 7th.The others were confined at Chattanooga, Knoxville, and
afterward at Atlanta, where seven were executed as spies.Of the fourteen
survivors, eight escaped from prison; and of these, six eventually reached
the Union lines.Six were removed to Richmond and confined in Castle
Thunder until they were exchanged in 1863.The Confederates attempted to
destroy the locomotive when they evacuated Atlanta.[Illustration: BATTLE BETWEEN THE MONITOR AND MERRIMAC._Painted by E. Packbauer._

[Illustration: THE BIGGEST GUN OF ALL--THE 20-INCH MONSTER FOR WHICH NO
TARGET WOULD SERVE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.A photograph of the only 20-inch gun made during the war.On March 30, 1861, a 15-inch Columbiad was heralded in
_Harper's Weekly_ as the biggest gun in the world, but three years later
this was exceeded.In 1844 Lieutenant (later Brigadier-General) Thomas
Jefferson Rodman of the Ordnance Department commenced a series of tests to
find a way to obviate the injurious strains set up in the metal, by
cooling a large casting from the exterior.He finally developed his theory
of casting a gun with the core hollow and then cooling it by a stream of
water or cold air through it.So successful was this method that the War
Department, in 1860, authorized a 15-inch smooth-bore gun.General Rodman then projected his 20-inch smooth-bore gun,
which was made in 1864 under his direction at Fort Pitt, Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania.It was mounted at Fort Hamilton, New York Harbor, very soon
afterwards, but on account of the tremendous size and destructive effect
of its projectiles it was fired only four times during the war.It was
almost impossible to get a target that would withstand the shots and leave
anything to show what had happened.These four shots were fired with 50,
75, 100 and 125 pounds of powder.The projectile weighed 1,080 pounds, and
the maximum pressure on the bore was 25,000 pounds.In March, 1867, it was
again fired four times with 125, 150, 175 and 200 pounds of powder, each
time with an elevation of twenty-five degrees, the projectile attaining a
maximum range of 8,001 yards.This is no mean record even compared with
twentieth century pieces.NEWS OF MARCH 30, 1861

[Illustration: THE "CHEESE BOX" THAT MADE HISTORY AS IT APPEARED FOUR
MONTHS LATER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In this remarkable view of the "Monitor's" turret, taken in July, 1862, is
seen as clearly as on the day after the great battle the effect of the
Confederate fire upon Ericsson's novel craft.As the two vessels
approached each other about half-past eight on that immortal Sunday
morning, the men within the turret waited anxiously for the first shot of
their antagonist.It soon came from her bow gun and went wide of the mark.The "Virginia" no longer had the broadside of a wooden ship at which to
aim.Not until the "Monitor" was alongside the big ironclad at close range
came the order "Begin firing" to the men in the "cheese box."Then the
gun-ports of the turret were triced back, and it began to revolve for the
first time in battle.As soon as the guns were brought to bear, two
11-inch solid shot struck the "Virginia's" armor; almost immediately she
replied with her broadside, and Lieutenant Greene and his gunners listened
anxiously to the shells bursting against their citadel.They made no more
impression than is apparent in the picture.Confident in the protection of
their armor, the Federals reloaded with a will and came again and again to
close quarters with their adversary, hurling two great projectiles about
every eight minutes.[Illustration: MEN ON THE "MONITOR" WHO FOUGHT WITH WORDEN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here on the deck of the "Monitor" sit some of the men who held up the
hands of Lieutenant Worden in the great fight with the "Virginia."In the
picture, taken in July, 1862, only four months afterward, one of the nine
famous dents on the turret are visible.It required courage not only to
fight in the "Monitor" for the first time but to embark on her at all, for
she was a strange and untried invention at which many high authorities
shook their heads.But during the battle, amid all the difficulties of
breakdowns by the new untried machinery, Lieutenant S. Dana Greene coolly
directed his men, who kept up a fire of remarkable accuracy.Twenty of the
forty-one 11-inch shot fired from the "Monitor" took effect, more or less,
on the iron plates of the "Virginia."The "Monitor" was struck nine times
on her turret, twice on the pilot-house, thrice on the deck, and eight
times on the side.While Greene was fighting nobly in the turret, Worden
with the helmsman in the pilot-house was bravely maneuvering his vessel
and seeking to ram his huge antagonist.Twice he almost succeeded and both
times Greene's guns were used on the "Virginia" at point-blank range with
telling effect.Toward the close of the action Worden was blinded by a
shell striking near one of the peep-holes in the pilot-house and the
command devolved upon Greene.Worden, even in his agony of pain while the
doctor was attending his injuries, asked constantly about the progress of
the battle; and when told that the "Minnesota" was safe, he said, "Then I
can die happy."[Illustration: ADMIRAL J. L. WORDEN]


DAVID GLASGOW FARRAGUT THE MAN WHO DARED AT NEW ORLEANS AND MOBILE BAY

[Illustration]

"ANY MAN WHO IS PREPARED FOR DEFEAT WOULD BE HALF DEFEATED BEFORE HE
COMMENCED"

THE COMMANDER OF THE FEDERAL FLEET AT NEW ORLEANS

"Who is this Farragut?"So the younger generation of Americans must have
wondered, at the news of late January, 1862.Farragut was to have a flag
in the Gulf and was expected to capture New Orleans.Thus far in the War,
he had done nothing but sit on an obscure retiring board in the Navy
Department at Washington.But Commander David D. Porter knew him, for it
was with Porter's own father in the famous old "Essex" that Farragut as a
mere boy had proved worthy to command a fighting ship.And now it was
Porter who had recommended him for a task considered gravely dangerous by
all, foolhardy by not a few.This was no less than to pass the forts below
New Orleans, defeat a powerful and determined Confederate flotilla,
capture the city, and then sweep up the Mississippi and split the
Confederacy in two.To this Farragut rigidly held himself and the brave
men under him, when, in the dark hour before dawn of April 24, 1862, they
faced the terrible bombardment of the forts and fought their way through
the flames of fire rafts desperately maneuvered by the opposing gunboats.Next day New Orleans was Farragut's.Leaving it to the co-operating army
under General B. F. Butler, Farragut pushed on up the river, passed and
repassed the fortifications at Vicksburg, but the army needed to drive
home the wedge thus firmly entered by the navy was not yet ready.It was
another year before the sturdy blows of Farragut were effectually
supplemented ashore.[Illustration: THE MEN WHO DARED--SAILORS ON THE "HARTFORD" AFTER PASSING
THE NEW ORLEANS FORTS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On this page of unwritten history McPherson and Oliver, the New Orleans
war-time photographers, have caught the crew of the staunch old "Hartford"
as they relaxed after their fiery test.In unconscious picturesqueness
grouped about the spar-deck, the men are gossiping or telling over again
their versions of the great deeds done aboard the flagship.Some have
seized the opportunity for a little plain sewing, while all are interested
in the new and unfamiliar process of "having their pictures taken."The
notable thing about the picture is the number of young faces.Only a few
of the old salts whose bearded and weather-beaten faces give evidence of
service in the old navy still remain.After the great triumph in Mobile
Bay, Farragut said of these men: "I have never seen a crew come up like
ours.They are ahead of the old set in small arms, and fully equal to them
at the great guns.They arrived here a mere lot of boys and young men, and
have now fattened up and knocked the nine-inch guns about like twenty-four
pounders, to the astonishment of everybody.There was but one man who
showed fear and he was allowed to resign.This was the most desperate
battle I ever fought since the days of the old 'Essex.'""It was the
anxious night of my life," wrote Farragut later.The spar-deck shown below
recalls another speech."Don't flinch from that fire, boys!There is a
hotter fire for those who don't do their duty!"So shouted Farragut with
his ship fast aground and a huge fire-raft held hard against her wooden
side by the little Confederate tug "Mosher."The ship seemed all ablaze
and the men, "breathing fire," were driven from their guns.Farragut,
calmly pacing the poop deck, called out his orders, caring nothing for the
rain of shot from Fort St.The men, inspired by such coolness,
leaped to their stations again and soon a shot pierced the boiler of the
plucky "Mosher" and sank her.[Illustration: SPAR-DECK OF THE "HARTFORD"]




THE FIGHT FOR RICHMOND


A shattered and discomfited army were the hosts of McDowell when they
reached the banks of the Potomac, after that ill-fated July Sunday at Bull
Run.Dispirited by the sting of defeat, this motley and unorganized mass
of men became rather a mob than an army.The transformation of this chaos
of demoralization into the trained, disciplined, and splendid troops of
the Grand Army of the Potomac, was a triumph of the "young Napoleon"--Gen.Fresh from his victories in the mountains of
West Virginia, he was called to Washington to transmute 200,000 American
citizens, fresh from shop and farm, into soldiers.For months it was "drill, drill."Public opinion grew restless at the cry
"All's Quiet Along the Potomac."At last, on March 17th, McClellan moved.On April 5th the Union army was advancing toward Richmond up the
Peninsula, but was stopped at Yorktown by the Confederate General
Magruder.Not until May 3rd were McClellan's siege guns in place.At Williamsburg the lines in Gray
stood again."Jeb" Stuart, D. H. Hill, and Jubal Early fought nobly.They
gained their object--more time for their retreating comrades.But
McClellan's fighting leaders, Hooker, Kearny and Hancock, were not to be
denied.With Yorktown and Williamsburg inscribed upon its victorious banners, the
Army of the Potomac took up again its toilsome march from Cumberland
Landing toward the Confederate capital on the James.It was the 16th of May, 1862, when the advanced corps reached White House,
the ancestral home of the Lees.On every side were fields of wheat, and,
were it not for the presence of one hundred thousand men, there was the
promise of a full harvest.It was here that General McClellan took up his
headquarters, a distance of twenty-four miles from Richmond.In the Confederate capital a panic had seized the people.As the
retreating army of Johnston sought the environs of Richmond and news of
the invading hosts was brought in, fear took possession of the inhabitants
and many wild rumors were afloat as to the probable capture of the city.But it was not a fear that Johnston would not fight.The strategic policy
of the Southern general had been to delay the advance of the Northern
army.Fortunately for him, the rainy weather proved a powerful ally.The
time had now come when he should change his position from the defensive to
the offensive.The Army of Northern Virginia had been brought to bay, and
it now turned to beat off the invaders and save its capital.On the historic Peninsula lay two of the greatest and most splendid armies
that had ever confronted each other on the field of battle.The
engagement, now imminent, was to be the first in that series of contests,
between the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia, ending
three years thereafter, at Appomattox, when the war-worn veterans of gray
should lay down their arms, in honor, to the war-worn veterans of blue.The Union advance was retarded by the condition of the weather and the
roads.Between McClellan's position at White House and the waiting
Confederate army lay the Chickahominy, an erratic and sluggish stream,
that spreads itself out in wooded swamps and flows around many islands,
forming a valley from half a mile to a mile wide, bordered by low bluffs.In dry weather it is but a mere brook, but a moderate shower will cause it
to rise quickly and to offer formidable opposition to any army seeking its
passage.The valley is covered with trees whose tops reach to the level
of the adjacent highlands, thus forming a screen from either side.The
bridges crossing it had all been destroyed by the retreating army except
the one at Mechanicsville, and it was not an easy task that awaited the
forces of McClellan as they made their way across the spongy soil.The van of the Union army reached the Chickahominy on May 20th.The bridge
was gone but the men under General Naglee forded the little river,
reaching the plateau beyond, and made a bold reconnaissance before the
Confederate lines.In the meantime, newly constructed bridges were
beginning to span the Chickahominy, and the Federal army soon was crossing
to the south bank of the river.General McClellan had been promised reenforcements from the north.General
McDowell with forty thousand men had started from Fredericksburg to join
him north of the Chickahominy.For this reason, General McClellan had
thrown the right wing of his army on the north of the river while his left
would rest on the south side of the stream.This position of his army did
not escape the eagle eye of the Confederate general, Joseph E. Johnston,
who believed the time had now come to give battle, and perhaps destroy the
small portion of the Union forces south of the river.Meanwhile, General "Stonewall" Jackson, in the Shenandoah, was making
threatening movements in the direction of Washington, and McDowell's
orders to unite with McClellan were recalled.The roads in and about Richmond radiate from that city like the spokes of
a wheel.One of these is the Williamsburg stage-road, crossing the
Chickahominy at Bottom's Bridge, only eleven miles from Richmond.It was
along this road that the Federal corps of Keyes and Heintzelman had made
their way.Their orders were "to go prepared for battle at a moment's
notice" and "to bear in mind that the Army of the Potomac has never been
checked."Parallel to this road, and about a mile to the northward, runs the
Richmond and York River Railroad.Seven miles from Richmond another
highway intersects the one from Williamsburg, known as the Nine Mile road.At the point of this intersection once grew a clump of seven pines, hence
the name of "Seven Pines," often given to the battle fought on this spot.A thousand yards beyond the pines were two farmhouses in a grove of oaks.Where the Nine Mile road crossed the railroad was
Fair Oaks Station.Southeast of Seven Pines was White Oak Swamp.Casey's division of Keyes'
corps was stationed at Fair Oaks Farm.A fifth of a mile in front lay his
picket line, extending crescent shape, from the swamp to the Chickahominy.Couch's division of the same corps was at Seven Pines, with his right wing
extending along the Nine Mile road to Fair Oaks Station.Heintzelman's
corps lay to the rear; Kearney's division guarded the railroad at Savage's
Station and Hooker's the approaches to the White Oak Swamp.It was a well-wooded region and at this time was
in many places no more than a bog.No sooner had these positions been
taken, than trees were cut to form abatis, rifle-pits were hastily dug,
and redoubts for placing artillery were constructed.The picket line lay
along a dense growth of woods.Through an opening in the trees, the
Confederate army could be seen in force on the other side of the clearing.The plans of the Confederate general were well matured.On Friday, May
30th, he gave orders that his army should be ready to move at daybreak.That night the "windows of heaven seemed to have been opened" and the
"fountains of the deep broken up."It was
the most violent storm that had swept over that region for a generation.The thunderbolts rolled without
cessation.The earth was
thoroughly drenched.From mud-soaked beds
the soldiers arose the next morning to battle.Owing to the storm the Confederates did not move so early as intended.However, some of the troops were in readiness by eight o'clock.Hour after
hour the forces of Longstreet and Hill awaited the sound of the signal-gun
that would tell them General Huger was in his position to march.It was near noon before General Hill, weary of waiting,
advanced to the front, preceded by a line of skirmishers, along the
Williamsburg road.The Union pickets were lying at the edge of the forest.The soldiers in the pits had been under arms for several hours awaiting
the attack.Suddenly there burst through the woods the soldiers of the
South.A shower of bullets fell beneath the trees and the Union pickets
gave way.On and on came the lines of gray in close columns.In front of
the abatis had been planted a battery of four guns.General Naglee with
four regiments, the Fifty-sixth and One hundredth New York and Eleventh
Maine and One hundred and fourth Pennsylvania, had gone forward, and in
the open field met the attacking army.Naglee's men charged with their bayonets and pressed the gray lines back
again to the edge of the woods.Here they were met by a furious fire of
musketry and quickly gave way, seeking the cover of the rifle-pits at Fair
Oaks Farm.In this position, for nearly three
hours the Federals waged an unequal combat against three times their
number.Then, suddenly a galling fire plowed in on them from the left.It
came from Rains' brigade, which had executed a flank movement.At the same
time the brigade of Rodes rushed toward them.The Federals saw the
hopelessness of the situation.The officers at the batteries tried to
spike their guns but were killed in the attempt.Hastily falling back,
five guns were left to be turned on them in their retreat.In another minute they would have been entirely surrounded
and captured.The next stand would be made at
Seven Pines, where Couch was stationed.The forces here had been weakened
by sending relief to Casey.The situation of the Federals was growing
critical.At the same time General Longstreet sent reenforcements to
General Hill.Couch was forced out of his position toward the right in the
direction of Fair Oaks Station and was thus separated from the main body
of the army, then in action.The Confederates pushed strongly against the Federal center.Heintzelman
came to the rescue.For an hour and a
half the lines of blue and gray surged back and forth.The Federals were
gradually giving way.The left wing, alone, next to the White Oak Swamp,
was holding its own.At the same time over at Fair Oaks Station whither Couch had been forced,
were new developments.He was about to strike the Confederate army on its
left flank, but just when the guns were being trained, there burst across
the road the troops of General G. W. Smith, who up to this time had been
inactive.These men were fresh for the fight, superior in number, and soon
overpowered the Northerners.It looked for a time as if the whole Union
army south of the Chickahominy was doomed.Over at Seven Pines the center of McClellan's army was about to be routed.Now it was that General Heintzelman personally collected about eighteen
hundred men, the fragments of the broken regiments, and took a decided
stand at the edge of the timber.But
this alone would not nor did not save the day.To the right of this new
line of battle, there was a rise of ground.From here the woods abruptly
sloped to the rear.If this elevation were once secured by the
Confederates, all would be lost and rout would be inevitable.The quick
eye of General Keyes took in the situation.He was stationed on the left;
to reach the hill would necessitate taking his men between the
battle-lines.Calling on a
single regiment to follow he made a dash for the position.The Southern
troops, divining his intention, poured a deadly volley into his ranks and
likewise attempted to reach this key to the situation.The Federals gained
the spot just in time.The new line was formed as a heavy mass of
Confederates came upon them.The tremendous Union fire was too much for
the assaulting columns, which were checked.They had forced the Federal
troops back from their entrenchments a distance of two miles, but they
never got farther than these woods.The river fog now came up as the
evening fell and the Southern troops spent the night in the captured
camps, sleeping on their arms.The Federals fell back toward the river to
an entrenched camp.Meanwhile at Fair Oaks Station the day was saved, too, in the nick of
time, for the Federals.On the north side of the Chickahominy were
stationed the two divisions of Sedgwick and Richardson, under command of
General Sumner.Scarcely had the battle opened when McClellan at his
headquarters, six miles away, heard the roar and rattle of artillery.He
was sick at the time, but he ordered General Sumner to be in readiness.At
this time there were four bridges across the river--two of them were
Bottom's Bridge and the railroad bridge.To go by either of these would
consume too much time in case of an emergency.General Sumner had himself
constructed two more bridges, lying between the others.The heavy flood of
the preceding night, which was still rising, had swept one of these
partially away.In order to save time, he put his men under arms and
marched them to the end of the upper bridge and there waited throughout
the greater part of the afternoon for orders to cross.Before them rolled
a muddy and swollen stream, above whose flood was built a rude and
unstable structure.From the other side could be distinctly heard the
roar of battle.The fate of the day and of the Army of the Potomac rested
upon these men at the end of the bridge.The possibility of crossing was doubted by everyone, including the general
himself.The bridge had been built of logs, held together and kept from
drifting by the stumps of trees.Over the river proper it was suspended by
ropes attached to trees, felled across the stream.At last the long-expected order to advance came.The men stepped upon the
floating bridge.It swayed to and fro as the solid column passed over it.Beneath the men was the angry flood which would engulf all if the bridge
should fall.Gradually the weight pressed it down between the solid stumps
and it was made secure till the army had crossed.Had the passage been
delayed another hour the flood would have rendered it impassable.Guided by the roar of battle the troops hurried on.The artillery was left
behind in the mud of the Chickahominy.The steady, rolling fire of
musketry and the boom of cannon told of deadly work in front.It was
nearly six o'clock before Sedgwick's column deployed into line in the rear
of Fair Oaks Station.Just now there was a lull in
the battle.The Confederates were gathering themselves for a vigorous
assault on their opponents' flaming front.General Joseph E. Johnston himself had immediate command.President
Jefferson Davis had come out from his capital to witness the contest.A heavy fusillade poured from
their batteries and muskets.Great rents were made in the line of blue.The openings were quickly filled and a scorching fire was
sent into the approaching columns.Again and again the charge was repeated
only to be repulsed.Then came the order to fix bayonets.Five
regiments--Thirty-fourth and Eighty-second New York, Fifteenth and
Twentieth Massachusetts and Seventh Michigan--pushed to the front.Into
the woods where the Confederates had fallen back the charge was made.Driving the Southern lines back in confusion, these dashing columns saved
the day for the Army of the Potomac.Night was now settling over the wooded field.Here and there flashes of
light could be seen among the oaks, indicating a diligent search for the
wounded.General Johnston ordered his troops to sleep on the field.A few
minutes later he was struck by a rifle-ball and almost immediately a shell
hit him, throwing him from his horse, and he was borne off the field.The
first day of the battle was over.The disability of the Southern commander made it possible for the
promotion of a new leader upon whom the fortunes of the Army of Northern
Virginia would soon rest.This was General Robert E. Lee; although the
immediate command for the next day's contest fell upon General G. W.
Smith.Early Sunday morning the battle was again in progress.The command
of Smith, near Fair Oaks Station, advanced down the railroad, attacking
Richardson, whose lines were north of it and were using the embankment as
a fortification.Longstreet's men were south of the railroad.The firing
was heavy all along this line, the opposing forces being not more than
fifty yards from each other.For an hour and a half the musketry fire was
intensely heavy.The line of gray could
not withstand the galling fire and for the first time that day fell back.But the Union line had been broken, too.Both sides
were gathering themselves for another onslaught.It was then that there
were heard loud shouts from the east of the railroad.There, coming through the woods, was a large body of Federal troops.They formed a magnificent body of soldiers and
seemed eager for the fray.Turning in on the Williamsburg road they
rapidly deployed to the right and the left.In front of them was an open
field, with a thick wood on the other side.The Confederates had posted
themselves in this forest and were waiting for their antagonists.The
Federals marched upon the field in double-quick time; their movements
became a run, and they began firing as they dashed forward.They were met
by a withering fire of field artillery and a wide gap being opened in
their ranks.They reached the edge of the woods and
as they entered its leafy shadows the tide of battle rolled in with them.The front line was lost to view in the forest, except for an occasional
gleam of arms from among the trees.The din and the clash and roar of
battle were heard for miles.It was almost
a hand-to-hand combat in the heavy forest and tangled slashings.The sound
of battle gradually subsided, then ceased except for the intermittent
reports of small arms, and the second day's fight was over.The Federal troops could
now occupy without molestation the positions they held the previous
morning.The forest paths were strewn with the dead and the dying.Many of
the wounded were compelled to lie under the scorching sun for hours before
help reached them.Every farmhouse became an improvised hospital where the
suffering soldiers lay.Many were placed upon cars and taken across the
Chickahominy.The dead soldiers, blue and
gray, found sometimes lying within a few feet of each other, were buried
on the field of battle.The two giants had met in their first great combat
and were even now beginning to gird up their loins for a desperate
struggle before the capital of the Confederacy.[Illustration: "LITTLE MAC" PREPARING FOR THE CAMPAIGN--A ROYAL AIDE

stationed on the defenses of Washington at Minor's Hill in Virginia, and
General McClellan was engaged in transforming the raw recruits in the
camps near the national capital into the finished soldiers of the Army of
the Potomac."Little Mac," as they called him, was at this time at the
height of his popularity.He appears in the center between two of his

RAMPARTS THAT BAFFLED McCLELLAN.(Hasty fortifications of the Confederates
at Yorktown.)It was against such fortifications as these, which Magruder
had hastily reenforced with sand-bags, that McClellan spent a month
preparing his heavy batteries.Magruder had far too few soldiers to man
his long line of defenses properly, and his position could have been taken
by a single determined attack.This rampart was occupied by the
Confederate general, D. H. Hill, who had been the first to enter Yorktown
in order to prepare it for siege.He was the last to leave it on the night
of May 3, 1862.[Illustration]

WRECKED ORDNANCE.(Gun exploded by the Confederates on General Hill's
rampart, Yorktown.)Although the Confederates abandoned 200 pieces of
ordnance at Yorktown, they were able to render most of them useless before
leaving.Hill succeeded in terrorizing the Federals with grape-shot, and
some of this was left behind.After the evacuation the ramparts were
overrun by Union trophy seekers.The soldier resting his hands upon his
musket is one of the Zouaves whose bright and novel uniforms were so
conspicuous early in the war.This spot was directly on the line of the
British fortification of 1781.[Illustration]

ordnance fell into the hands of the Confederates early in the war, through
the ill-advised and hasty abandonment of Norfolk Navy Yard by the
Federals.Many of these guns did service at Yorktown and subsequently on
the James River against the Union.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.THE CONFEDERATE COMMAND OF THE RIVER.Looking north up the river, four of the five 8-inch Columbiads composing

Confederates, the guns being spiked.The vessels in the river are
transport ships, with the exception of the frigate just off shore.[Illustration: THE GOAL--THE CONFEDERATE CAPITOL]

TWO KEEPERS OF THE GOAL

The North expected General McClellan to possess himself of this citadel of
the Confederacy in June, 1862, and it seemed likely the expectation would
be realized.In the upper picture we get a near view of the State House at
Richmond, part of which was occupied as a Capitol by the Confederate
Congress during the war.In this building were stored the records and
archives of the Confederate Government, many of which were lost during the
hasty retreat of President Davis and his cabinet at the evacuation of
Richmond, April, 1865.Below, we see the city of Richmond from afar, with
the Capitol standing out boldly on the hill.McClellan was not destined to
reach this coveted goal, and it would not have meant the fall of the
Confederacy had he then done so.When Lincoln entered the building in
1865, the Confederacy had been beaten as much by the blockade as by the
operations of Grant and Sherman with vastly superior forces.[Illustration: THE SPIRES OF RICHMOND

COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Here are the portraits of the two military leaders who were conspicuous in
the Confederate attack upon McClellan's camp at Fair Oaks.General D. H.
Hill did most of the fierce fighting which drove back the Federals on the
first day, and only the timely arrival of Sumner's troops enabled the
Federals to hold their ground.Had they failed they would have been driven
into the morasses of the Chickahominy, retreat across which would have
been difficult as the bridges were partly submerged by the swollen stream.After General Johnston was wounded, General G. W. Smith was in command
during the second day's fighting.[Illustration: GENERAL G. W. SMITH, C. S.[Illustration: GENERAL D. H. HILL, C. S.[Illustration: THE ADVANCE THAT BECAME A RETREAT]

Here, almost within sight of the goal (Richmond), we see McClellan's
soldiers preparing the way for the passage of the army and its supplies.The soil along the Chickahominy was so marshy that in order to move the
supply trains and artillery from the base at White House and across the
river to the army, corduroy approaches to the bridges had to be built.It
was well that the men got this early practice in road-building.Thanks to
the work kept up, McClellan was able to unite the divided wings of the
army almost at will.[Illustration: "REGULARS" NEAR FAIR OAKS--OFFICERS OF McCLELLAN'S HORSE

Confederate batteries will open upon him, and for the next few moments
shells and bullets from the shrapnels will be bursting and whistling about
his ears.Then he will pass out of the danger-zone to an altitude beyond
the reach of the Confederate artillery.After the evacuation of Yorktown,
May 4, 1862, Professor Lowe, who had been making daily observations from
his balloon, followed McClellan's divisions, which was to meet Longstreet
next day at Williamsburg.On reaching the fortifications of the abandoned
city, Lowe directed the men who were towing the still inflated balloon in
which he was riding to scale the corner of the fort nearest to his old
camp, where the last gun had been fired the night before.This fort had
devoted a great deal of effort to attempting to damage the too inquisitive
balloon, and a short time previously one of the best Confederate guns had
burst, owing to over-charging and too great an elevation to reach the high
altitude.The balloonist had witnessed the explosion and a number of
gunners had been killed and wounded within his sight.His present visit
was in order to touch and examine the pieces and bid farewell to what he
then looked upon as a departed friend.This is indicated as the same gun

vital point of the battle."A close examination of this photograph will
reveal Professor Lowe's hand resting on the network of the balloon,
although his body is not in the photograph.It truly is remarkable that
Professor Lowe should have seen and recognized, nearly half a century
afterward, this photograph taken at one of the most critical moments of
his life.[Illustration: THE SLAUGHTER FIELD AT FAIR OAKS.]Over this ground the fiercest fighting of the two days' battle took place,
on May 31, 1862.Some 400 soldiers were buried here, where they fell, and
their hastily dug graves appear plainly in the picture.In the redoubt
seen just beyond the two houses was the center of the Federal line of
battle, equi-distant, about a mile and a half, from both Seven Pines and
Fair Oaks.The entrenchments near these farm dwellings were begun on May
28th by Casey's Division, 4th Corps.There was not time to finish them
before the Confederate attack opened the battle, and the artillery of
Casey's Division was hurriedly placed in position behind the incomplete
works.[Illustration: THE UNFINISHED REDOUBT.]In the smaller picture we see the inside of the redoubt at the left

artillery did telling work, handsomely repelling the attack early in the
afternoon of May 31st.Later in the day Confederate sharpshooters from
vantage points in neighboring trees began to pick off the officers and the
gunners and the redoubt had to be relinquished.The abandoned guns were
turned against the retreating Federals.[Illustration: THE "REDHOT BATTERY."COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.On the afternoon of May 31st, at Fair Oaks, the Confederates were driving

(McCarthy's) together with Miller's battery opened up with so continuous
and severe a fire that the Federals were able to make a stand and hold
their own for the rest of the day.The guns grew so hot from constant
firing that it was only with the greatest care that they could be swabbed
and loaded.These earthworks were thrown up for McCarthy's Battery,
Company C, 1st Pennsylvania Artillery, near Savage's Station.The soldiers
nicknamed it the "Redhot Battery."[Illustration: AIMING THE GUNS AT FAIR OAKS.COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Here we see the beginning of the lull in the fighting of the second day at
Fair Oaks, which it has been asserted led to a fatal delay and the ruin of
McClellan's Peninsula Campaign.The first day's battle at Fair Oaks, May
31, 1862, was decidedly a Federal reverse which would have developed into
a rout had not Sumner, crossing his troops on the perilous Grapevine
Bridge, come up in time to rally the retreating men.Here we see some of
them within the entrenchments at Fair Oaks Station on the Richmond & York
River Railroad.The order will soon come to cease firing at the end of the
second day's fighting, the result of which was to drive the Confederates
back to Richmond.The heavy rainstorm on the
night of May 30th had made the movement of artillery extremely difficult,
and McClellan wanted to complete the bridges and build entrenchments
before advancing.This delay gave the Confederates time to reorganize
their forces and place them under the new commander, Robert E. Lee, who
while McClellan lay inactive effected a junction with "Stonewall" Jackson.Then during the Seven Days' Battles Lee steadily drove McClellan from his
position, within four or five miles of Richmond, to a new position on the
James River.From this secure and advantageous water base McClellan
planned a new line of advance upon the Confederate Capital.In the smaller
picture we see the interior of the works at Fair Oaks Station, which were
named Fort Sumner in honor of the General who brought up his Second Corps
and saved the day.The camp of the Second Corps is seen beyond the

THE CANNONEERS WHO KEPT UP WITH THE CAVALRY--IN THIS SWIFTEST BRANCH OF
THE SERVICE EACH MAN RIDES HORSEBACK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Here are drawn up Harry Benson's Battery A, of the Second United States
Artillery, and Horatio Gates Gibson's Batteries C and G, combined of the
Third United States Artillery, near Fair Oaks, Virginia.They arrived
there just too late to take part in the battle of June, 1862.By "horse
artillery," or "flying artillery" as it is sometimes called, is meant an
organization equipped usually with 10-pounder rifled guns, with all hands
mounted.In ordinary light artillery the cannoneers either ride on the
gun-carriage or go afoot.In "flying artillery" each cannoneer has a
horse.This form is by far the most mobile of all, and is best suited to
accompany cavalry on account of its ability to travel rapidly.With the
exception of the method of mounting the cannoneers, there was not any
difference between the classes of field batteries except as they were
divided between "light" and "heavy."In the photograph above no one is
riding on the gun-carriages, but all have separate mounts.Battery A of
the Second United States Artillery was in Washington in January, 1861, and
took part in the expedition for the relief of Fort Pickens, Florida.It
went to the Peninsula, fought at Mechanicsville May 23-24, 1862, and took
part in the Seven Days' battles before Richmond June 25th to July 1st.Batteries C and G of the Third United States Artillery were at San
Francisco, California, till October 1861, when they came East, and also
went to the Peninsula and served at Yorktown and in the Seven Days.THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY

    Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible, and when
    you strike and overcome him, never let up in the pursuit so long as
    your men have strength to follow.... The other rule is, never fight
    against heavy odds, if by any possible maneuvering you can hurl your
    own force on only a part, and that the weakest part, of your enemy and
    crush it.Such tactics will win every time, and a small army may thus
    destroy a large one in detail.--_"Stonewall" Jackson._


The main move of the Union army, for 1862, was to be McClellan's advance
up the Peninsula toward Richmond.Everything had been most carefully
planned by the brilliant strategist.With the assistance of McDowell's
corps, he expected in all confidence to be in the Confederate capital
before the spring had closed.But, comprehensively as he had worked the
scheme out, he had neglected a factor in the problem which was destined in
the end to bring the whole campaign to naught.This was the presence of
"Stonewall" Jackson in the Valley of Virginia.The strategic value to the Confederacy of this broad, sheltered avenue
into Maryland and Pennsylvania was great.Along the northeasterly roads
the gray legions could march in perfect safety upon the rear of Washington
so long as the eastern gaps could be held.No wonder that the Federal
authorities, however much concerned with other problems of the war, never
removed a vigilant eye from the Valley.Jackson had taken possession of Winchester, near the foot of the Valley,
in November, 1861.The Confederate
army dwindled greatly during the winter.At the beginning of March there
were but forty-five hundred men.With Banks and his forty thousand now on
Virginia soil at the foot of the Valley, and Fremont's army approaching
the head, why should the Federal commander even think about this
insignificant fragment of his foe?But the records of war have shown that
a small force, guided by a master mind, sometimes accomplishes more in
effective results than ten times the number under a less active and able
commander.The presence of Banks compelled Jackson to withdraw to Woodstock, fifty
miles south of Winchester.If McClellan ever experienced any anxiety as to
affairs in the Valley, it seems to have left him now, for he ordered Banks
to Manassas on March 16th to cover Washington, leaving General Shields and
his division of seven thousand men to hold the Valley.When Jackson heard
of the withdrawal, he resolved that, cut off as he was from taking part in
the defense of Richmond, he would do what he could to prevent any
aggrandizement of McClellan's forces.Shields hastened to his station at Winchester, and Jackson, on the 23d of
March, massed his troops at Kernstown, about three miles south of the
former place.Deceived as to the strength of his adversary, he led his
weary men to an attack on Shields' right flank about three o'clock in the
afternoon.He carried the ridge where the Federals were posted, but the
energy of his troops was spent, and they had to give way to the reserves
of the Union army after three hours of stubborn contest.The Federal ranks
were diminished by six hundred; the Confederate force by more than seven
hundred.Kernstown was a Union victory; yet never in history did victory
bring such ultimate disaster upon the victors.At Washington the alarm was intense over Jackson's audacious attack.Williams' division of Banks' troops was halted on its way to Manassas and
sent back to Winchester.Lincoln transferred Blenker's division, nine
thousand strong, to Fremont.These things were done at once, but they were
by no means the most momentous consequence of Kernstown.The President
began to fear that Jackson's goal was Washington.After consulting six of
his generals he became convinced that McClellan had not arranged proper
protection for the city.Therefore, McDowell and his corps of thirty-seven
thousand men were ordered to remain at Manassas.The Valley grew to
greater importance in the Federal eyes.Banks was made entirely
independent of McClellan and the defense of this region became his sole
task.McClellan, to his great chagrin, saw his force depleted by forty-six
thousand men.There were now four Union generals in the East operating
independently one of the other.General Ewell with eight thousand troops on the upper Rappahannock and
General Johnson with two brigades were now ordered to cooperate with
Jackson.Schenck and Milroy, of
Fremont's corps, began to threaten Johnson.Banks, with twenty thousand,
was near Harrisonburg.The Confederate leader left General Ewell to watch Banks while he made a
dash for Milroy and Schenck.He fought them at McDowell on May 8th and
they fled precipitately to rejoin Fremont.The swift-acting Jackson now
darted at Banks, who had fortified himself at Strasburg.Jackson stopped
long enough to be joined by Ewell.He did not attack Strasburg, but stole
across the Massanutten Mountain unknown to Banks, and made for Front
Royal, where a strong Union detachment was stationed under Colonel Kenly.Early on the afternoon of May 23d, Ewell rushed from the forest.Kenly and
his men fled before them toward Winchester.A large number were captured
by the cavalry before they had gotten more than four miles away.Banks at Strasburg realized that Jackson was approaching from the rear,
the thing he had least expected and had made no provision for.There was nothing to be done but
retreat to Winchester.Even that was prevented by the remarkable speed of
Jackson's men, who could march as much as thirty-five miles a day.On May
24th, the Confederates overtook and struck the receding Union flank near
Newtown, inflicting heavy loss and taking many prisoners.Altogether,
three thousand of Banks' men fell into Jackson's hands.This exploit was most opportune for the Southern arms.It caused the final
ruin of McClellan's hopes.Banks received one more attack from Ewell's
division the next day as he passed through Winchester on his way to the
shelter of the Potomac.He crossed at Williamsport late the same evening
and wrote the President that his losses, though serious enough, might have
been far worse "considering the very great disparity of forces engaged,
and the long-matured plans of the enemy, which aimed at nothing less than
entire capture of our force."Lincoln now rescinded his resolution to
send McDowell to McClellan.Instead, he transferred twenty thousand of the
former's men to Fremont and informed McClellan that he was not, after all,
to have the aid of McDowell's forty thousand men.Fremont was coming from the west; Shields lay in the other direction, but
Jackson was not the man to be trapped.He managed to hold Fremont while he
marched his main force quickly up the Valley.At Port Republic he drove
Carroll's brigade of Shields' division away and took possession of a
bridge which Colonel Carroll had neglected to burn.Fremont in pursuit was
defeated by Ewell at Cross Keys.Jackson immediately put his force of
twelve thousand over the Shenandoah at Port Republic and burned the
bridge.Safe from the immediate attack by Fremont, he fell upon Tyler and
Carroll, who had not more than three thousand men between them.The
Federals made a brave stand, but after many hours' fighting were compelled
to retreat.Jackson emerged through Swift Run Gap on the 17th of June, to
assist in turning the Union right on the Peninsula, and Banks and Shields,
baffled and checkmated at every move, finally withdrew from the Valley.[Illustration: "STONEWALL" JACKSON AT WINCHESTER 1862

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]It is the great good fortune of American hero-lovers that they can gaze
here upon the features of Thomas Jonathan Jackson precisely as that
brilliant Lieutenant-General of the Confederate States Army appeared
during his masterly "Valley Campaign" of 1862.Few photographers dared to
approach this man, whose silence and modesty were as deep as his mastery
of warfare.Indeed, his plans were rarely
known even to his immediate subordinates, and herein lay the secret of
those swift and deadly surprises that raised him to first rank among the
world's military figures.Jackson's ability and efficiency won the utter
confidence of his ragged troops; and their marvelous forced marches, their
contempt for privations if under his guidance, put into his hands a living
weapon such as no other leader in the mighty conflict had ever wielded.[Illustration: NANCY HART THE CONFEDERATE GUIDE AND SPY

among these fearless girls who knew every inch of the regions in which
they lived was Nancy Hart.So valuable was her work as a guide, so
cleverly and often had she led Jackson's cavalry upon the Federal outposts
in West Virginia, that the Northern Government offered a large reward for
her capture.Lieutenant-Colonel Starr of the Ninth West Virginia finally
caught her at Summerville in July, 1862.While in a temporary prison, she
faced the camera for the first time in her life, displaying more alarm in
front of the innocent contrivance than if it had been a body of Federal
soldiery.She posed for an itinerant photographer, and her captors placed
the hat decorated with a military feather upon her head.Nancy managed to
get hold of her guard's musket, shot him dead, and escaped on Colonel
Starr's horse to the nearest Confederate detachment.A few days later,
July 25th, she led two hundred troopers under Major Bailey to Summerville.They reached the town at four in the morning, completely surprising two
companies of the Ninth West Virginia.They fired three houses, captured
Colonel Starr, Lieutenant Stivers and other officers, and a large number
of the men, and disappeared immediately over the Sutton road.[Illustration: THE GERMAN DIVISION SENT AGAINST JACKSON

Springfield rifles from his own stores.When the combined forces met
Jackson and Ewell at Cross Keys, five of Blenker's regiments were sent

THE SEVEN DAYS' BATTLES

    McClellan's one hope, one purpose, was to march his army out of the
    swamps and escape from the ceaseless Confederate assaults to a point
    on James River where the resistless fire of the gunboats might protect
    his men from further attack and give them a chance to rest.To that
    end, he retreated night and day, standing at bay now and then as the
    hunted stag does, and fighting desperately for the poor privilege of
    running away.And the splendid fighting of his men was a tribute to the skill and
    genius with which he had created an effective army out of what he had
    described as "regiments cowering upon the banks of the Potomac, some
    perfectly raw, others dispirited by recent defeat, others going home."Out of a demoralized and disorganized mass reenforced by utterly
    untrained civilians, McClellan had within a few months created an army
    capable of stubbornly contesting every inch of ground even while
    effecting a retreat the very thought of which might well have
    disorganized an army.--_George Cary Eggleston, in "The History of the
    Confederate War."_


General Lee was determined that the operations in front of Richmond should
not degenerate into a siege, and that the Army of Northern Virginia should
no longer be on the defensive.To this end, early in the summer of 1862,
he proceeded to increase his fighting force so as to make it more nearly
equal in number to that of his antagonist.Every man who could be spared
from other sections of the South was called to Richmond.Numerous
earthworks soon made their appearance along the roads and in the fields
about the Confederate capital, giving the city the appearance of a
fortified camp.The new commander in an address to the troops said that
the army had made its last retreat.Meanwhile, with the spires of Richmond in view, the Army of the Potomac
was acclimating itself to a Virginia summer.The whole face of the country
for weeks had been a veritable bog.Now that the sweltering heat of June
was coming on, the malarious swamps were fountains of disease.The
polluted waters of the sluggish streams soon began to tell on the health
of the men.Malaria and typhoid were prevalent; the hospitals were
crowded, and the death rate was appalling.Such conditions were not inspiring to either general or army.McClellan
was still hoping for substantial reenforcements.McDowell, with his forty
thousand men, had been promised him, but he was doomed to disappointment
from that source.Yet in the existing state of affairs he dared not be
inactive.South of the Chickahominy, the army was almost secure from
surprise, owing to well-protected rifle-pits flanked by marshy thickets or
covered with felled trees.But the Federal forces were still divided by
the fickle stream, and this was a constant source of anxiety to the
commander.He proceeded to transfer all of his men to the Richmond side of
the river, excepting the corps of Franklin and Fitz John Porter.About the
middle of June, General McCall with a force of eleven thousand men joined
the Federal army north of the Chickahominy, bringing the entire fighting
strength to about one hundred and five thousand.So long as there remained
the slightest hope of additional soldiers, it was impossible to withdraw
all of the army from the York side of the Peninsula, and it remained
divided.That was a brilliant initial stroke of the Confederate general when he
sent his famous cavalry leader, J. E. B. Stuart, with about twelve hundred
Virginia troopers, to encircle the army of McClellan.Veiling his
intentions with the utmost secrecy, Stuart started June 12, 1862, in the
direction of Fredericksburg as if to reenforce "Stonewall" Jackson.The
first night he bivouacked in the pine woods of Hanover.No fires were
kindled, and when the morning dawned, his men swung upon their mounts
without the customary bugle-call of "Boots and Saddles."Turning to the
east, he surprised and captured a Federal picket; swinging around a corner
of the road, he suddenly came upon a squadron of Union cavalry.The
Confederate yell rent the air and a swift, bold charge by the Southern
troopers swept the foe on.They had not traveled far when they came again to a force drawn up in
columns of fours, ready to dispute the passage of the road.This time the
Federals were about to make the charge.A squadron of the Confederates
moved forward to meet them.Some Union skirmishers in their effort to get
to the main body of their troops swept into the advancing Confederates and
carried the front ranks of the squadron with them.These isolated
Confederates found themselves in an extremely perilous position, being
gradually forced into the Federal main body.Before they could extricate
themselves, nearly every one in the unfortunate front rank was shot or cut
down.The Southern cavalrymen swept on and presently found themselves nearing
the York River Railroad--McClellan's supply line.As they approached
Tunstall's Station they charged down upon it, with their characteristic
yell, completely surprising a company of Federal infantry stationed there.Telegraph wires were cut and a tree felled
across the track to obstruct the road.This had hardly been done before
the shriek of a locomotive was heard.A train bearing Union troops came
thundering along, approaching the station.The engineer, taking in the
situation at a glance, put on a full head of steam and made a rush for the
obstruction, which was easily brushed aside.As the train went through a
cut the Confederates fired upon it, wounding and killing some of the
Federal soldiers in the cars.Riding all through a moonlit night, the raiders reached Sycamore Ford of
the Chickahominy at break of day.As usual this erratic stream was
overflowing its banks.They started to ford it, but finding that it would
be a long and wearisome task, a bridge was hastily improvised at another
place where the passage was made with more celerity.Now, on the south
bank of the river, haste was made for the confines of Richmond, where, at
dawn of the following day, the troopers dropped from their saddles, a
weary but happy body of cavalry.Lee thus obtained exact and detailed information of the position of
McClellan's army, and he laid out his campaign accordingly.Meanwhile his
own forces in and about Richmond were steadily increasing.He was planning
for an army of nearly one hundred thousand and he now demonstrated his
ability as a strategist.Word had been despatched to Jackson in the
Shenandoah to bring his troops to fall upon the right wing of McClellan's
army.At the same time Lee sent General Whiting north to make a feint of
joining Jackson and moving upon Washington.The authorities at Washington were frightened, and McClellan
received no more reenforcements.Jackson now began a hide-and-seek game
among the mountains, and managed to have rumors spread of his army being
in several places at the same time, while skilfully veiling his actual
movements.It was not until the 25th of June that McClellan had definite knowledge of
Jackson's whereabouts.He was then located at Ashland, north of the
Chickahominy, within striking distance of the Army of the Potomac.McClellan was surprised but he was not unprepared.Seven days before he
had arranged for a new base of supplies on the James, which would now
prove useful if he were driven south of the Chickahominy.On the very day he heard of Jackson's arrival at Ashland, McClellan was
pushing his men forward to begin his siege of Richmond--that variety of
warfare which his engineering soul loved so well.His advance guard was
within four miles of the Confederate capital.His strong fortifications
were bristling upon every vantage point, and his fond hope was that within
a few days, at most, his efficient artillery, for which the Army of the
Potomac was famous, would be belching forth its sheets of fire and lead
into the beleagured city.In front of the Union encampment, near Fair
Oaks, was a thick entanglement of scrubby pines, vines, and ragged bushes,
full of ponds and marshes.This strip of woodland was less than five
hundred yards wide.Beyond it was an open field half a mile in width.The
Union soldiers pressed through the thicket to see what was on the other
side and met the Confederate pickets among the trees.Upon emerging into the open, the Federal troops found it
filled with rifle-pits, earthworks, and redoubts.At once they were met
with a steady and incessant fire, which continued from eight in the
morning until five in the afternoon.At times the contest almost reached
the magnitude of a battle, and in the end the Union forces occupied the
former position of their antagonists.This passage of arms, sometimes
called the affair of Oak Grove or the Second Battle of Fair Oaks, was the
prelude to the Seven Days' Battles.The following day, June 26th, had been set by General "Stonewall" Jackson
as the date on which he would join Lee, and together they would fall upon
the right wing of the Army of the Potomac.The Federals north of the
Chickahominy were under the direct command of General Fitz John Porter.Defensive preparations had been made on an extensive scale.Field works,
heavily armed with artillery, and rifle-pits, well manned, covered the
roads and open fields and were often concealed by timber from the eye of
the opposing army.The extreme right of the Union line lay near
Mechanicsville on the upper Chickahominy.A tributary of this stream from
the north was Beaver Dam Creek, upon whose left bank was a steep bluff,
commanding the valley to the west.This naturally strong position, now
well defended, was almost impregnable to an attack from the front.Before sunrise of the appointed day the Confederate forces were at the
Chickahominy bridges, awaiting the arrival of Jackson.To reach these some
of the regiments had marched the greater part of the night.Noon passed and
Jackson had not arrived.At three o'clock, General A. P. Hill, growing
impatient, decided to put his troops in motion.Crossing at Meadow Bridge,
he marched his men along the north side of the Chickahominy, and at
Mechanicsville was joined by the commands of Longstreet and D. H. Hill.Driving the Union outposts to cover, the Confederates swept across the low
approach to Beaver Dam Creek.A murderous fire from the batteries on the
cliff poured into their ranks.Gallantly the attacking columns withstood
the deluge of leaden hail and drew near the creek.A few of the more
aggressive reached the opposite bank but their repulse was severe.Later in the afternoon relief was sent to Hill, who again attempted to
force the Union position at Ellerson's Mill, where the <DW72> of the west
bank came close to the borders of the little stream.From across the open
fields, in full view of the defenders of the cliff, the Confederates moved
down the <DW72>.They were in range of the Federal batteries, but the fire
was reserved.Every artilleryman was at his post ready to fire at the
word; the soldiers were in the rifle-pits sighting along the glittering
barrels of their muskets with fingers on the triggers.As the approaching
columns reached the stream they turned with the road that ran parallel to
the bank.From every waiting field-piece the shells came screaming through the air.Volley after volley of musketry was poured into the flanks of the marching
Southerners.The hillside was soon covered with the victims of the gallant
charge.Twilight fell upon the warring troops and there were no signs of a
cessation of the unequal combat.Night fell, and still from the heights
the lurid flames burst in a display of glorious pyrotechnics.It was nine
o'clock when Hill finally drew back his shattered regiments, to await the
coming of the morning.The Forty-fourth Georgia regiment suffered most in
the fight; three hundred and thirty-five being the dreadful toll, in dead
and wounded, paid for its efforts to break down the Union position.Dropping back to the rear this ill-fated regiment attempted to re-form its
broken ranks, but its officers were all among those who had fallen.Both
armies now prepared for another day and a renewal of the conflict.The action at Beaver Dam Creek convinced McClellan that Jackson was really
approaching with a large force, and he decided to begin his change of base
from the Pamunkey to the James, leaving Porter and the Fifth Corps still
on the left bank of the Chickahominy, to prevent Jackson's fresh troops
from interrupting this great movement.It was, indeed, a gigantic
undertaking, for it involved marching an army of a hundred thousand men,
including cavalry and artillery, across the marshy peninsula.A train of
five thousand heavily loaded wagons and many siege-guns had to be
transported; nearly three thousand cattle on the hoof had to be driven.From White House the supplies could be shipped by the York River Railroad
as far as Savage's Station.Thence to the James, a distance of seventeen
miles, they had to be carried overland along a road intersected by many
others from which a watchful opponent might easily attack.General Casey's
troops, guarding the supplies at White House, were transferred by way of
the York and the James to Harrison's Landing on the latter river.The
transports were loaded with all the material they could carry.The rest
was burned, or put in cars.These cars, with locomotives attached, were
then run into the river.On the night of June 26th, McCall's Federal division, at Beaver Dam Creek,
was directed to fall back to the bridges across the Chickahominy near
Gaines' Mill and there make a stand, for the purpose of holding the
Confederate army.During the night the wagon trains and heavy guns were
quietly moved across the river.Just before daylight the operation of
removing the troops began.The Confederates were equally alert, for about
the same time they opened a heavy fire on the retreating columns.This
march of five miles was a continuous skirmish; but the Union forces, ably
and skilfully handled, succeeded in reaching their new position on the
Chickahominy heights.The morning of the new day was becoming hot and sultry as the men of the
Fifth Corps made ready for action in their new position.The selection of
this ground had been well made; it occupied a series of heights fronted on
the west by a sickle-shaped stream.The battle-lines followed the course
of this creek, in the arc of a circle curving outward in the direction of
the approaching army.The land beyond the creek was an open country,
through which Powhite Creek meandered sluggishly, and beyond this a wood
densely tangled with undergrowth.Around the Union position were also many
patches of wooded land affording cover for the troops and screening the
reserves from view.Porter had learned from deserters and others that Jackson's forces, united
to those of Longstreet and the two Hills, were advancing with grim
determination to annihilate the Army of the Potomac.He had less than
eighteen thousand men to oppose the fifty thousand Confederates.To
protect the Federals, trees had been felled along a small portion of their
front, out of which barriers protected with rails and knapsacks were
erected.Porter had considerable artillery, but only a small part of it
could be used.It was two o'clock, on June 27th, when General A. P. Hill
swung his division into line for the attack.He was unsupported by the
other divisions, which had not yet arrived, but his columns moved rapidly
toward the Union front.The assault was terrific, but twenty-six guns
threw a hail-storm of lead into his ranks.Under the cover of this
magnificent execution of artillery, the infantry sent messages of death to
the approaching lines of gray.The Confederate front recoiled from the incessant outpour of grape,
canister, and shell.The heavy cloud of battle smoke rose lazily through
the air, twisting itself among the trees and settling over the forest like
a pall.The tremendous momentum of the repulse threw the Confederates into
great confusion.Men were separated from their companies and for a time it
seemed as if a rout were imminent.The Federals, pushing out from under
the protection of their great guns, now became the assailants.The
Southerners were being driven back.Others threw themselves on the ground to escape the withering fire, while
some tenaciously held their places.General
Slocum arrived with his division of Franklin's corps, and his arrival
increased the ardor of the victorious Federals.It was then that Lee ordered a general attack upon the entire Union front.Reenforcements were brought to take the place of the shattered regiments.The engagement began with a sharp artillery fire from the Confederate
guns.Then the troops moved forward, once more to assault the Union
position.In the face of a heavy fire they rushed across the sedgy
lowland, pressed up the hillside at fearful sacrifice and pushed against
the Union front.It was a death grapple for the mastery of the field.General Lee, sitting on his horse on an eminence where he could observe
the progress of the battle, saw, coming down the road, General Hood, of
Jackson's corps, who was bringing his brigade into the fight.Riding
forward to meet him, Lee directed that he should try to break the line.Hood, disposing his men for the attack, sent them forward, but, reserving
the Fourth Texas for his immediate command, he marched it into an open
field, halted, and addressed it, giving instructions that no man should
fire until ordered and that all should keep together in line.The forward march was sounded, and the intrepid Hood, leading his men,
started for the Union breastworks eight hundred yards away.They moved at
a rapid pace across the open, under a continually increasing shower of
shot and shell.At every step the ranks grew thinner and thinner.As they
reached the crest of a small ridge, one hundred and fifty yards from the
Union line, the batteries in front and on the flank sent a storm of shell
and canister plowing into their already depleted files.They quickened
their pace as they passed down the <DW72> and across the creek.Not a shot
had they fired and amid the sulphurous atmosphere of battle, with the wing
of death hovering over all, they fixed bayonets and dashed up the hill
into the Federal line.With a shout they plunged through the felled timber
and over the breastworks.The Union line had been pierced and was giving
way.It was falling back toward the Chickahominy bridges, and the retreat
was threatening to develop into a general rout.The twilight was closing
in and the day was all but lost to the Army of the Potomac.Now a great
shout was heard from the direction of the bridge and, pushing through the
stragglers at the river bank were seen the brigades of French and Meagher,
detached from Sumner's corps, coming to the rescue.General Meagher, in
his shirt sleeves, was leading his men up the bluff and confronted the
Confederate battle line.This put a stop to the pursuit and as night was
at hand the Southern soldiers withdrew.The battle of Gaines' Mill, or the
Chickahominy, was over.When Lee came to the banks of the little river the next morning he found
his opponent had crossed over and destroyed the bridges.The Army of the
Potomac was once more united.During the day the Federal wagon trains were
safely passed over White Oak Swamp and then moved on toward the James
River.Lee did not at first divine McClellan's intention.He still
believed that the Federal general would retreat down the Peninsula, and
hesitated therefore to cross the Chickahominy and give up the command of
the lower bridges.But now on the 29th the signs of the movement to the
James were unmistakable.Early on that morning Longstreet and A. P. Hill
were ordered to recross the Chickahominy by the New Bridge and Huger and
Magruder were sent in hot pursuit of the Federal forces.It was the brave
Sumner who covered the march of the retreating army, and as he stood in
the open field near Savage's Station he looked out over the plain and saw
with satisfaction the last of the ambulances and wagons making their way
toward the new haven on the James.In the morning of that same day he had already held at bay the forces of
Magruder at Allen's Farm.On his way from Fair Oaks, which he left at
daylight, he had halted his men at what is known as the "Peach Orchard,"
and from nine o'clock till eleven had resisted a spirited fire of musketry
and artillery.And now as the grim warrior, on this Sunday afternoon in
June, turned his eyes toward the Chickahominy he saw a great cloud of dust
rising on the horizon.It was raised by the troops of General Magruder who
was pressing close behind the Army of the Potomac.The Southern field-guns
were placed in position.A contrivance, consisting of a heavy gun mounted
on a railroad car and called the "Land Merrimac," was pushed into position
and opened fire upon the Union forces.The battle began with a fine play
of artillery.For an hour not a musket was fired.The army of blue
remained motionless.Then the mass of gray moved across the field and from
the Union guns the long tongues of flame darted into the ranks before
them.The charge was met with vigor and soon the battle raged over the
entire field.Both sides stood their ground till darkness again closed the
contest, and nearly eight hundred brave men had fallen in this Sabbath
evening's battle.Before midnight Sumner had withdrawn his men and was
following after the wagon trains.The Confederates were pursuing McClellan's army in two columns, Jackson
closely following Sumner, while Longstreet was trying to cut off the Union
forces by a flank movement.On the last day of June, at high noon, Jackson
reached the White Oak Swamp.He attempted to ford
the passage, but the Union troops were there to prevent it.While Jackson
was trying to force his way across the stream, there came to him the sound
of a desperate battle being fought not more than two miles away, but he
was powerless to give aid.Longstreet and A. P. Hill had come upon the Federal regiments at Glendale,
near the intersection of the Charles City road, guarding the right flank
of the retreat.It was Longstreet who, about half-past two, made one of
his characteristic onslaughts on that part of the Union army led by
General McCall.Each brigade seemed to act on its own behalf.They hammered
here, there, and everywhere.Repulsed at one place they charged at
another.The Eleventh Alabama, rushing out from behind a dense wood,
charged across the open field in the face of the Union batteries.The men
had to run a distance of six hundred yards.A heavy and destructive fire
poured into their lines, but on they came, trailing their guns.The
batteries let loose grape and canister, while volley after volley of
musketry sent its death-dealing messages among the Southerners.But
nothing except death itself could check their impetuous charge.When two
hundred yards away they raised the Confederate yell and rushed for
Randol's battery.Pausing for an instant they deliver a volley and attempt to seize the
guns.Bayonets are crossed and men engage in a hand-to-hand struggle.The
contending masses rush together, asking and giving no quarter and
struggling like so many tigers.Darkness is closing on the fearful scene,
yet the fighting continues with unabated ferocity.There are the shouts of
command, the clash and the fury of the battle, the sulphurous smoke, the
flashes of fire streaking through the air, the yells of defiance, the
thrust, the parry, the thud of the clubbed musket, the hiss of the bullet,
the spouting blood, the death-cry, and beneath all lie the bodies of
America's sons, some in blue and some in gray.While Lee and his army were held in check by the events of June 30th at
White Oak Swamp and the other battle at Glendale or Nelson's Farm, the
last of the wagon trains had arrived safely at Malvern Hill.The contest
had hardly closed and the smoke had scarcely lifted from the blood-soaked
field, when the Union forces were again in motion toward the James.By
noon on July 1st the last division reached the position where McClellan
decided to turn again upon his assailants.He had not long to wait, for
the Confederate columns, led by Longstreet, were close on his trail, and a
march of a few miles brought them to the Union outposts.They found the
Army of the Potomac admirably situated to give defensive battle.Malvern
Hill, a plateau, a mile and a half long and half as broad, with its top
almost bare of woods, commanded a view of the country over which the
Confederate army must approach.Along the western face of this plateau
there are deep ravines falling abruptly in the direction of the James
River; on the north and east is a gentle <DW72> to the plain beneath,
bordered by a thick forest.Around the summit of the hill, General
McClellan had placed tier after tier of batteries, arranged like an
amphitheater.Surmounting these on the crest were massed seven of his
heaviest siege-guns.His army surrounded this hill, its left flank being
protected by the gunboats on the river.The morning and early afternoon were occupied with many Confederate
attacks, sometimes formidable in their nature, but Lee planned for no
general move until he could bring up a force that he considered sufficient
to attack the strong Federal position.The Confederate orders were to
advance when the signal, a yell, cheer, or shout from the men of
Armistead's brigade, was given.Late in the afternoon General D. H. Hill heard some shouting, followed by
a roar of musketry.No other general seems to have heard it, for Hill made
his attack alone.It was gallantly done, but no army could have withstood
the galling fire of the batteries of the Army of the Potomac as they were
massed upon Malvern Hill.All during the evening, brigade after brigade
tried to force the Union lines.The gunners stood coolly and manfully by
their batteries.The Confederates were not able to make concerted efforts,
but the battle waxed hot nevertheless.They were forced to breast one of
the most devastating storms of lead and canister to which an assaulting
army has ever been subjected.The round shot and grape cut through the
branches of the trees and the battle-field was soon in a cloud of smoke.Column after column of Southern soldiers rushed up to the death-dealing
cannon, only to be mowed down.The thinned and ragged lines, with a valor
born of desperation, rallied again and again to the charge, but to no
avail.The batteries on the heights still hurled their missiles of death.The field below was covered with the dead and wounded of the Southland.The gunboats in the river made the battle scene more awe-inspiring with
their thunderous cannonading.Their heavy shells shrieked through the
forest, and great limbs were torn from the trees as they hurtled by in
their outburst of fury.The combatants were no longer distinguishable except by
the sheets of flame.It was nine o'clock before the guns ceased their
fire, and only an occasional shot rang out over the bloody field of
Malvern Hill.The courageous though defeated Confederate, looking up the next day
through the drenching rain to where had stood the embrasured wall with its
grim batteries and lines of blue, that spoke death to so many of his
companions-in-arms, saw only deserted ramparts.The Union army had
retreated in the darkness of the night.But this time no foe harassed its
march.Unmolested, it sought its new camp at Harrison's Landing, where it
remained until August 3d, when, as President Lincoln had been convinced of
the impracticability of operating from the James River as a base, orders
were issued by General Halleck for the withdrawal of the Army of the
Potomac from the Peninsula.The net military result of the Seven Days was a disappointment to the
South.Although thankful that the siege of Richmond had been raised, the
Southern public believed that McClellan should not have been allowed to
reach the James River with his army intact."That army," Eggleston states, "splendidly organized, superbly equipped,
and strengthened rather than weakened in morale, lay securely at rest on
the James River, within easy striking distance of Richmond.There was no
knowing at what moment McClellan might hurl it again upon Richmond or upon
that commanding key to Richmond--the Petersburg position.In the hands of
a capable commander McClellan's army would at this time have been a more
serious menace than ever to the Confederate capital, for it now had an
absolutely secure and unassailable base of operations, while its fighting
quality had been improved rather than impaired by its seven days of
battling."General Lee's own official comment on the military problem involved and
the difficulties encountered was: "Under ordinary circumstances the
Federal army should have been destroyed.Its escape was due to the causes
already stated.Prominent among these is the want of correct and timely
information.This fact, attributable chiefly to the character of the
country, enabled General McClellan skilfully to conceal his retreat and to
add much to the obstructions with which nature had beset the way of our
pursuing columns; but regret that more was not accomplished gives way to
gratitude to the Sovereign Ruler of the Universe for the results
achieved."Whatever the outcome of the Seven Days' Battle another year was to
demonstrate beyond question that the wounding of General Johnston at Fair
Oaks had left the Confederate army with an even abler commander.On such a
field as Chancellorsville was to be shown the brilliancy of Lee as leader,
and his skilful maneuvers leading to the invasion of the North.And the
succeeding volume will tell, on the other hand, how strong and compact a
fighting force had been forged from the raw militia and volunteers of the
North.[Illustration: McDOWELL AND McCLELLAN--TWO UNION LEADERS WHOSE PLANS
"STONEWALL" JACKSON FOILED

COPYRIGHT BY REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In General McClellan's plan for the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, General
McDowell, with the First Army Corps of 37,000 men, was assigned a most
important part, that of joining him before Richmond.Lincoln had
reluctantly consented to the plan, fearing sufficient protection was not
provided for Washington.By the battle of Kernstown, March 23d, in the
Valley of Virginia, Jackson, though defeated, so alarmed the
Administration that McDowell was ordered to remain at Manassas to protect
the capital.The reverse at Kernstown was therefore a real triumph for
Jackson, but with his small force he had to keep up the game of holding
McDowell, Banks, and Fremont from reenforcing McClellan.If he failed,
80,000 troops might move up to Richmond from the west while McClellan was
approaching from the North.But Jackson, on May 23d and 25th, surprised
Banks' forces at Front Royal and Winchester, forcing a retreat to the
Potomac.At the news of this event McDowell was ordered not to join
McClellan in front of Richmond.[Illustration: JOHNSTON AND LEE--A PHOTOGRAPH OF 1869._Copyright by Review of Reviews Co._]

These men look enough alike to be brothers.They were so in arms, at West
Point, in Mexico and throughout the war.General Joseph E. Johnston (on
the left), who had led the Confederate forces since Bull Run, was wounded
at Fair Oaks.That wound gave Robert E. Lee (on the right) his opportunity
to act as leader.After Fair Oaks, Johnston retired from the command of
the army defending Richmond.The new commander immediately grasped the
possibilities of the situation which confronted him.The promptness and
completeness with which he blighted McClellan's high hopes of reaching
Richmond showed at one stroke that the Confederacy had found its great
general.It was only through much sifting that the North at last picked
military leaders that could rival him in the field.[Illustration: THE FLEET THAT FED THE ARMY]

White House Landing came the steam and sailing vessels laden with supplies
for McClellan's second attempt to reach Richmond.Tons of ammunition and
thousands of rations were sent forward from here to the army on the
Chickahominy in June, 1862.A short month was enough to cause McClellan to
again change his plans, and the army base was moved to the James River.The Richmond and York Railroad was lit up by burning cars along its course
to the Chickahominy.Little was left to the Confederates save the charred
ruins of the White House itself.[Illustration: ELLERSON'S MILL--WHERE HILL ASSAULTED.]Not until after nightfall of June 26, 1862, did the Confederates of
General A. P. Hill's division cease their assaults upon this position
where General McCall's men were strongly entrenched.Time after time the
Confederates charged over the ground we see here at Ellerson's Mill, near
Mechanicsville.Till 9 o'clock at night they continued to pour volleys at
the position, and then at last withdrew.The victory was of little use to
the Federals, for Jackson on the morrow, having executed one of the
flanking night marches at which he was an adept, fell upon the Federal
rear at Gaines' Mill.[Illustration: THE WASTE OF WAR

COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Railroad trains loaded with tons of food and ammunition were run
deliberately at full speed off the embankment shown in the left

was the readiest means that McClellan could devise for keeping his immense
quantity of stores out of the hands of the Confederates in his hasty
change of base from White House to the James after Gaines' Mill.This was
the bridge of the Richmond and York River Railroad, and was destroyed June
28, 1862, to render the railroad useless to the Confederates.[Illustration: THE BRIDGE THAT STOOD]

The force under General McCall was stationed by McClellan on June 19,
1862, to observe the Meadow and Mechanicsville bridges over the
Chickahominy which had only partially been destroyed.On the afternoon of
June 26th, General A. P. Hill crossed at Meadow Bridge, driving the Union
skirmish-line back to Beaver Dam Creek.The divisions of D. H. Hill and
Longstreet had been waiting at Mechanicsville Bridge (shown in this
photograph) since 8 A.M.for A. P. Hill to open the way for them to cross.They passed over in time to bear a decisive part in the Confederate attack
at Gaines' Mill on the 27th.[Illustration: DOING DOUBLE DUTY

little to do but wear gold lace and transmit orders.But it is their duty
to multiply the eyes and ears and thinking power of the leader.Without
them he could not direct the movements of his army.There were so few
regular officers of ripe experience that members of the staff were
invariably made regimental commanders, and frequently were compelled to
divide their time between leading their troops into action and reporting
to and consulting with their superior.[Illustration: THE RETROGRADE CROSSING.][Illustration: LOWER BRIDGE ON THE CHICKAHOMINY

COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Woodbury's Bridge on the Chickahominy.Little did General D. F. Woodbury's
engineers suspect, when they built this bridge, early in June, 1862, as a
means of communication between the divided wings of McClellan's army on
the Chickahominy that it would be of incalculable service during battle.When the right wing, under General Fitz John Porter, was engaged on the
field of Gaines' Mill against almost the entire army of Lee, across this
bridge the division of General Slocum marched from its position in the
trenches in front of Richmond on the south bank of the river to the
support of Porter's men.The battle lasted until nightfall and then the
Federal troops moved across this bridge and rejoined the main forces of
the Federal army.Woodbury's engineers built several bridges across the
Chickahominy, but among them all the bridge named for their commander
proved to be, perhaps, the most serviceable.[Illustration: A VAIN RIDE TO SAFETY]

During the retreat after Gaines' Mill, McClellan's army was straining
every nerve to extricate itself and present a strong front to Lee before
he could strike a telling blow at its untenable position.Wagon trains
were struggling across the almost impassable White Oak Swamp, while the
troops were striving to hold Savage's Station to protect the movement.Thither on flat cars were sent the wounded as we see them in the picture.The rear guard of the Army of the Potomac had hastily provided such field
hospital facilities as they could.We see the camp near the railroad with
the passing wagon trains in the lower picture.But attention to these
wounded men was, perforce, secondary to the necessity of holding the
position.Their hopes of relief from their suffering were to be blighted.Lee was about to fall upon the Federal rear guard at Savage's Station.Instead of to a haven of refuge, these men were being railroaded toward
the field of carnage, where they must of necessity be left by their
retreating companions.[Illustration: THE STAND AT SAVAGE'S STATION

rifled gun, mounted on car-wheels.They turned its deadly fire steadily
upon the defenders.The Federals fought fiercely and managed to hold their
ground till nightfall, when hundreds of their bravest soldiers lay on the
field and had to be left alone with their wounded comrades who had arrived
on the flat cars.[Illustration: A GRIM CAPTURE

sufferings of the men that had to be abandoned.Here we see them at work
upon the wounded, who have been gathered from the field.Nothing but the
strict arrest of the stern sergeant Death can save these men from capture,
and when the Confederates occupied Savage's Station on the morning of June
30th, twenty-five hundred sick and wounded men and their medical
attendants became prisoners of war.The Confederate hospital facilities
were already taxed to their full capacity in caring for Lee's wounded, and
most of these men were confronted on that day with the prospect of
lingering for months in the military prisons of the South.The brave
soldiers lying helpless here were wounded at Gaines' Mill on June 27th and
removed to the great field-hospital established at Savage's Station.The

Through this well-nigh impassable morass of White Oak Swamp, across a
single long bridge, McClellan's wagon trains were being hurried the last
days of June, 1862.On the morning of the 30th, the rear-guard of the army
was hastily tramping after them, and by ten o'clock had safely crossed and
destroyed the bridge.They had escaped in the nick of time, for at noon
"Stonewall" Jackson opened fire upon Richardson's division and a terrific
artillery battle ensued for the possession of this, the single crossing by
which it was possible to attack McClellan's rear.The Federal batteries
were compelled to retire but Jackson's crossing was prevented on that day
by the infantry.[Illustration: HEROES OF MALVERN HILL]

after the victory of July 1, 1862, and the army marched to a new base
farther down the James, where the heavy losses of men and supplies during
the Seven Days could be made up without danger and delay.Harrison's
Landing was the point selected, and here the army recuperated, wondering
what would be the next step.Below we see the historic mansion which did
service as General Porter's headquarters, one of McClellan's most

duty to watch the movements of the Confederates and hold them back from
any attempt to fall upon the retreating trains and troops.A dense fog in
the early morning shut off the forces of A. P. Hill and Longstreet from
his view.He had not a single fieldpiece with which to resist attack.When
the mist cleared away, he kept up a great activity with his cavalry
horses, making the Confederates believe that artillery was being brought
up.With apparent reluctance he agreed to a truce of two hours in which
the Confederates might bury the dead they left on the hillside the day
before.Later, with an increased show of unwillingness, he extended the
truce for another two hours.Just before they expired, Frank's Battery
arrived to his support, with the news that the Army of the Potomac was
safe.Colonel Averell rejoined it without the loss of a man.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE THIRD PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY]

AFTER THE SEVEN DAYS

Within a week of the occupation of Harrison's Landing, McClellan's
position had become so strong that the Federal commander no longer
anticipated an attack by the Confederate forces.General Lee saw that his
opponent was flanked on each side by a creek and that approach to his
front was commanded by the guns in the entrenchments and those of the
Federal navy in the river.Lee therefore deemed it inexpedient to attack,
especially as his troops were in poor condition owing to the incessant
marching and fighting of the Seven Days.Rest was what both armies needed
most, and on July 8th the Confederate forces returned to the vicinity of
Richmond.McClellan scoured the country before he was satisfied of the
Confederate withdrawal.The Third and Fourth Pennsylvania cavalry made a
reconnaisance to Charles City Court House and beyond, and General Averell
reported on July 11th that there were no Southern troops south of the
lower Chickahominy.His scouting expeditions extended in the direction of
Richmond and up the Chickahominy.[Illustration: CHARLES CITY COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA, JULY, 1862

[Illustration]

THE MAN WHO KEPT THE KEY IN THE WEST

GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS

The possession of Corinth, Miss., meant the control of the railroads
without which the Federal armies could not push down the Mississippi
Valley and eastward into Tennessee.Autumn found Rosecrans with about
23,000 men in command at the post where were vast quantities of military
stores.On October 3, the indomitable Confederate leaders, Price and Van
Dorn, appeared before Corinth, and Rosecrans believing the movement to be
a feint sent forward a brigade to an advanced position on a hill.A sharp
battle ensued and in a brilliant charge the Confederates at last possessed
the hill.Convinced that there was really to be a determined assault on
Corinth, Rosecrans disposed his forces during the night.Just before dawn
the Confederate cannonade began, the early daylight was passed in
skirmishing, while the artillery duel grew hotter.Then a glittering
column of Price's men burst from the woods.Grape and canister were poured
into them, but on they came, broke through the Federal center and drove
back their opponents to the square of the town.Here the Confederates were
at last swept back.But ere that Van Dorn's troops had hurled themselves
on Battery Robinett to the left of the Federal line, and fought their way
over the parapet and into the battery.Federal
troops well placed in concealment rose up and poured volley after volley
into them.Rosecrans by a
well-planned defense had kept the key to Grant's subsequent control of the
West.[Illustration: GENERAL EARL VAN DORN, C. S.THE CONFEDERATE COMMANDER AT CORINTH

General Earl Van Dorn was born in Mississippi in 1821; he was graduated
from West Point in 1842, and was killed in a personal quarrel in 1863.Early in the war General Van Dorn had distinguished himself by capturing
the steamer "Star of the West" at Indianola, Texas.He was of a
tempestuous nature and had natural fighting qualities.During the month of
August he commanded all the Confederate troops in Mississippi except those
under General Price, and it was his idea to form a combined movement with
the latter's forces and expel the invading Federals from the northern
portion of his native State and from eastern Tennessee.The concentration
was made and the Confederate army, about 22,000 men, was brought into the
disastrous battle of Corinth.Brave were the charges made on the
entrenched positions, but without avail.[Illustration: GENERAL STERLING PRICE, C. S.THE CONFEDERATE SECOND IN COMMAND

General Sterling Price was a civilian who by natural inclination turned to
soldiering.He had been made a brigadier-general during the Mexican War,
but early allied himself with the cause of the Confederacy.At Pea Ridge,
only seven months before the battle of Corinth, he had been wounded.Of
the behavior of his men, though they were defeated and turned back on the
4th, he wrote that it was with pride that sisters and daughters of the
South could say of the officers and men, "My brother, father, fought at
Corinth."General Van Dorn, in referring to
the end of that bloody battle, wrote these pathetic words: "Exhausted from
loss of sleep, wearied from hard marching and fighting, companies and
regiments without officers, our troops--let no one censure them--gave way.[Illustration: BEFORE THE SOD HID THEM

life--quiet and cool as though on a drill.The artillery opened, the
infantry followed; notwithstanding the slaughter they were closer and
closer.Their commander [Colonel Rogers] seemed to bear a charmed life.He
jumped his horse across the ditch in front of the guns, and then on foot
came on.When he fell, the battle in our front was over."[Illustration: THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS._Painted by E. Packbauer._

[Illustration: GENERAL JOHN POPE]

THE UNFORTUNATE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF VIRGINIA

A SWIFT TURN OF FORTUNE'S WHEEL

Perhaps there is no more pathetic figure in the annals of the War than
Pope.In the West, that fiery furnace where the North's greatest generals
were already being molded, he stood out most prominently in the Spring of
1862.At Washington, the administration was cudgeling its brains for means
to meet the popular clamor for an aggressive campaign against Lee after
the Peninsula fiasco.Pope was sent for and arrived in Washington in June.When the plan to place him at the head of an army whose three corps
commanders all outranked him, was proposed, he begged to be sent back
West.But he was finally persuaded to undertake a task, the magnitude of
which was not yet appreciated at the North.During a month of preparation
he was too easily swayed by the advice and influenced by the plans of
civilians, and finally issued a flamboyant address to his army ending with
the statement, "My headquarters will be in the saddle."When this was
shown to Lee, he grimly commented, "Perhaps his headquarters will be where
his hindquarters ought to be."There followed the brief campaign, the
stunning collision with the solid front of Stonewall Jackson at Cedar
Mountain, and the clever strategy that took Pope at a disadvantage on the
old battlefield of Bull Run.Thence his army retreated more badly beaten
from a military standpoint than the rout which fled the same field a year
before.A brief summer had marked the rise and fall of Pope.Two years
later Sherman bade good-bye to his friend Grant also summoned from the
West."Remember Pope," was the gist of his warning; "don't stay in
Washington; keep in the field."CEDAR MOUNTAIN

    The Army of Virginia, under Pope, is now to bear the brunt of Lee's
    assault, while the Army of the Potomac is dismembered and sent back
    whence it came, to add in driblets to Pope's effective.--_Colonel
    Theodore A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye View of the Civil War."_


General George B. McClellan, with all his popularity at the beginning, had
failed in his Peninsula campaign to fulfil the expectations of the great
impatient public of the North.At the same time, while the Army of the
Potomac had as yet won no great victories, the men of the West could
triumphantly exhibit the trophies won at Donelson, at Pea Ridge, at
Shiloh, and at Island No.The North thereupon came to believe that the
Western leaders were more able than those of the East.This belief was
shared by the President and his Secretary of War and it led to the
determination to call on the West for help.The first to be called was General John Pope, who had won national fame by
capturing New Madrid and Island No.In answer
to a telegram from Secretary Stanton, Pope came to Washington in June,
1862.The secretary disclosed the plans on which he and President Lincoln
had agreed, that a new army, to be known as the Army of Virginia, was to
be created out of three corps, then under the respective commands of
Generals McDowell, N. P. Banks, and John C. Fremont.These corps had been
held from the Peninsula campaign for the purpose of protecting Washington.Pope demurred and begged to be sent back to the West, on the ground that
each of the three corps commanders was his senior in rank and that his
being placed at their head would doubtless create a feeling against him.But his protests were of no avail and he assumed command of the Army of
Virginia on the 26th of June.McDowell and Banks made no protest; but
Fremont refused to serve under one whom he considered his junior, and
resigned his position.His corps was assigned to General Franz Sigel.The new commander, General Pope, on the 14th of July, issued an address to
his army that was hardly in keeping with his modesty in desiring at first
to decline the honor that was offered him."I have come to you from the
West," he proclaimed, "where we have always seen the backs of our
enemies--from an army whose business it has been to seek the adversary and
to beat him when found.... Meantime I desire you to dismiss from your
minds certain phrases which I am sorry to find much in vogue among you.I
hear constantly of... lines of retreat and bases of supplies.Let us
discard such ideas.... Let us look before us and not behind."The immediate object of General Pope was to make the capital secure, to
make advances toward Richmond, and, if possible, to draw a portion of
Lee's army away from McClellan.From
this town, not far from the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains, there was a
railroad connecting it with Richmond--a convenient means of furnishing men
and supplies to the Confederate army.Pope decided to occupy the town and
destroy the railroad.To this end he ordered Banks to Culpeper and thence
to send all his cavalry to Gordonsville, capture the town and tear up ten
or fifteen miles of the railroad in the direction of Richmond.But, as if
a prelude to the series of defeats which General Pope was to suffer in the
next six weeks, he failed in this initial movement.The sagacious Lee had
divined his intention and had sent General "Stonewall" Jackson with his
and General Ewell's divisions on July 13th, to occupy Gordonsville.Ewell
arrived in advance of Jackson and held the town for the Confederates.In the campaign we are describing Jackson was the most active and
conspicuous figure on the Confederate side.He rested at Gordonsville for
two weeks, recuperating his health and that of the army, which had been
much impaired in the malarial district of the Peninsula.The fresh
mountain air blowing down from the Blue Ridge soon brought back their
wonted vigor.On July 27th A. P. Hill was ordered to join him, and the
Confederate leader now had about twenty-five thousand men.The movement on Gordonsville was exactly in accordance with Jackson's own
ideas which he had urged upon Lee.Although believing McClellan to be in
an impregnable position on the Peninsula, it was not less evident to him
that the Union general would be unable to move further until his army had
been reorganized and reenforced.This was the moment, he argued, to strike
in another direction and carry the conflict into the Federal territory.An
army of at least sixty thousand should march into Maryland and appear
before the National Capital.President Davis could not be won over to the
plan while McClellan was still in a position to be reenforced by sea, but
Lee, seeing that McClellan remained inactive, had determined, by sending
Jackson westward, to repeat the successful tactics of the previous spring
in the Shenandoah valley.Such a move might result in the recall of
McClellan.No sooner had Halleck assumed command of all the
Northern armies than the matter of McClellan's withdrawal was agitated and
on August 3d the head of the Army of the Potomac, to his bitter
disappointment, was ordered to join Pope on the Rappahannock.Halleck was
much concerned as to how Lee would act during the Federal evacuation of
the Peninsula, uncertain whether the Confederates would attempt to crush
Pope before McClellan could reenforce him, or whether McClellan would be
attacked as soon as he was out of his strong entrenchments at Harrison's
Landing.The latter of the two possibilities seemed the more probable, and Pope was
therefore ordered to push his whole army toward Gordonsville, in the hope
that Lee, compelled to strengthen Jackson, would be too weak to fall upon
the retiring Army of the Potomac.The Union army now occupied the great triangle formed roughly by the
Rappahannock and the Rapidan rivers and the range of the Blue Ridge
Mountains, with Culpeper Court House as the rallying point.Pope soon
found that the capturing of New Madrid and Island No.10 was easy in
comparison with measuring swords with the Confederate generals in the
East.On August 6th Pope began his general advance upon Gordonsville.Banks
already had a brigade at Culpeper Court House, and this was nearest to
Jackson.The small settlement was the meeting place of four roads by means
of which Pope's army of forty-seven thousand men would be united.Jackson,
informed of the advance, immediately set his three divisions in motion for
Culpeper, hoping to crush Banks, hold the town, and prevent the uniting of
the Army of Virginia.The remainder of Banks's
corps reached Culpeper on the 8th.On the morning of the 9th Jackson
finally got his troops over the Rapidan and the Robertson rivers.Two
miles beyond the latter stream there rose from the plain the <DW72> of
Slaughter Mountain, whose ominous name is more often changed into Cedar.This "mountain" is an isolated foothill of the Blue Ridge, some twenty
miles from the parent range, and a little north of the Rapidan.From its
summit could be seen vast stretches of quiet farmlands which had borne
their annual harvests since the days of the Cavaliers.Its gentle <DW72>s
were covered with forests, which merged at length into waving grain fields
and pasture lands, dotted here and there with rural homes.It was here on
the <DW72> of Cedar Mountain that one of the most severe little battles of
the war took place.On the banks of Cedar Run, seven miles south of Culpeper and but one or
two north of the mountain, Banks's cavalry were waiting to oppose
Jackson's advance.Learning of this the latter halted and waited for an
attack.He placed Ewell's batteries on the <DW72> about two hundred feet
above the valley and sent General Winder to take a strong position on the
left.So admirably was Jackson's army stationed that it would have
required a much larger force, approaching it from the plains, to dislodge
it.And yet, General Banks made an attempt with an army scarcely one-third
as large as that of Jackson.General Pope had made glowing promises of certain success and he well knew
that the whole North was eagerly watching and waiting for him to fulfil
them.He must strike somewhere and do it soon--and here was his chance at
Cedar Mountain.He sent Banks with nearly eight thousand men against this
brilliant Southern commander with an army three times as large, holding a
strong position on a mountain side.Banks with his infantry left Culpeper Court House on the morning of August
9th and reached the Confederate stronghold in the afternoon.He approached
the mountain through open fields in full range of the Confederate cannon,
which presently opened with the roar of thunder.All heedless of danger
the brave men ran up the <DW72> as if to take the foe by storm, when
suddenly they met a brigade of Ewell's division face to face and a brief,
deadly encounter took place.In a few minutes the Confederate right flank
began to waver and would no doubt have been routed but for the timely aid
of another brigade and still another that rushed down the hill and opened
fire on the Federal lines which extended along the eastern bank of Cedar
Run.Meanwhile the Union batteries had been wheeled into position and their
deep roar answered that of the foe on the hill.For two or three hours the
battle continued with the utmost fury.The ground was strewn with dead and
dying and human blood was poured out like water.But the odds were too
great and at length, as the shades of evening were settling over the gory
field, Banks began to withdraw the remnant of his troops.But he left two
thousand of his brave lads--one fourth of his whole army--dead or dying
along the hillside, while the Confederate losses were in excess of
thirteen hundred.The dead and wounded of both armies lay mingled in masses over the whole
battle-field.While the fighting continued, neither side could send aid or
relief to the maimed soldiers, who suffered terribly from thirst and lack
of attention as the sultry day gave place to a close, oppressive night.General Pope had remained at Culpeper, but, hearing the continuous
cannonading and knowing that a sharp engagement was going on, hastened to
the battle-field in the afternoon with a fresh body of troops under
General Ricketts, arriving just before dark.He instantly ordered Banks to
withdraw his right wing so as to make room for Ricketts; but the
Confederates, victorious as they had been, refused to continue the contest
against the reenforcements and withdrew to the woods up the mountain side.Heavy shelling was kept up by the hard-worked artillerymen of both armies
until nearly midnight, while the Federal troops rested on their arms in
line of battle.For two days the armies faced each other across the
valley.Pope's first battle as leader of an
Eastern army had resulted in neither victory nor defeat.[Illustration: A BREATHING SPELL

McClellan went to the Peninsula in March of 1862 he had expected all of
McDowell's Corps to be sent him as reenforcement before he made the final
advance on Richmond.But the brilliant exploits of Jackson in the
Shenandoah required the retention of all the troops in the vicinity of
Washington.A new army, in fact, was created to make the campaign which
Lincoln had originally wanted McClellan to carry out.The command was
given to General John Pope, whose capture of Island No.10 in the
Mississippi had brought him into national importance.The corps of Banks,
Fremont, and McDowell were consolidated to form this new army, called the
"Army of Virginia."General Fremont refused to serve under his junior, and
his force was given to Franz Sigel, who had won fame in 1861 in Missouri.This picture was taken about two weeks after the reorganization was
completed.The soldiers are those of McDowell's Corps.They are on the old

The Hero of the Federal Attack.General Samuel W. Crawford, here seen with
his staff, at Cedar Mountain led a charge on the left flank of the
Confederate forces that came near being disastrous for Jackson.At about
six o'clock the brigade was in line.General Williams reported: "At this
time this brigade occupied the interior line of a strip of woods.A field,
varying from 250 to 500 yards in width, lay between it and the next strip
of woods.In moving across this field the three right regiments and the
six companies of the Third Wisconsin were received by a terrific fire of
musketry.The Third Wisconsin especially fell under a partial flank fire
under which Lieut.-Colonel Crane fell and the regiment was obliged to give
way.Of the three remaining regiments which continued the charge
(Twenty-eighth New York, Forty-sixth Pennsylvania, and Fifth Connecticut)
every field-officer and every adjutant was killed or disabled.In the
Twenty-eighth New York every company officer was killed or wounded; in the
Forty-sixth Pennsylvania all but five; in the Fifth Connecticut all but
eight."It was one of the most heroic combats of the war.ALFRED N. DUFFIE]

A Leader of Cavalry.Colonel Alfred N. Duffie was in command of the First

McDowell's (Third) Corps in Pope's Army of Virginia.The cavalry had been
used pretty well during Pope's advance.On the 8th of August, the day
before the battle of Cedar Mountain, the cavalry had proceeded south to
the house of Dr.That night Duffie was on picket in advance of
General Crawford's troops, which had come up during the day and pitched
camp.The whole division came to his support on the next day.When the
infantry fell back to the protection of the batteries, the cavalry was
ordered to charge the advancing Confederates."Officers and men behaved
admirably, and I cannot speak too highly of the good conduct of all of the
brigade," reported General Bayard.After the battle the cavalry covered
the retreat of the artillery and ambulances.On August 18th, when the
retreat behind the Rappahannoc was ordered, the cavalry again checked the
Confederate advance.During the entire campaign the regiment of Colonel
Duffie did yeoman's service.[Illustration: THE FIRST CLASH

COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Battlefield of Cedar Mountain, August 9, 1862.Here the Confederate army
in its second advance on Washington first felt out the strength massed
against it.After Lee's brilliant tactics had turned McClellan's Peninsula
Campaign into a fiasco, the Confederate Government resolved to again take
the offensive.Plans were formed for a general invasion of the North, the
objective points ranging from Cincinnati eastward to the Federal capital
and Philadelphia.Immediately after Washington got wind of this, Lincoln
(on August 4th) issued a call for three hundred thousand men, and all
haste was made to rush the forces of McClellan from the Peninsula and of
Cox from West Virginia to the aid of the recently consolidated army under
Pope.On August 9, 1862, the vanguards of "Stonewall" Jackson's army and
of Pope's intercepting forces met at Cedar Mountain.Banks, with the
Second Corps of the Federal army, about eight thousand strong, attacked
Jackson's forces of some sixteen thousand.The charge was so furious that
Jackson's left flank was broken and rolled up, the rear of the center
fired upon, and the whole line thereby thrown into confusion.Banks,
however, received no reenforcements, while Jackson received strong
support.The Federal troops were driven back across the ground which they
had swept clear earlier in the afternoon.[Illustration]

previous evening.After an artillery fire that filled half the afternoon,
the advanced Federal cavalry was pressed back on the infantry supporting
the batteries.Banks underestimated the strength of the Confederates.Instead of sending to Pope for reenforcements, he ordered a charge on the
approaching troops.The Confederates, still feeling their way, were
unprepared for this movement and were thrown into confusion.But at the
moment when the Federal charge was about to end in success, three brigades
of A. P. Hill in reserve were called up.They forced the Federals to
retrace their steps to the point where the fighting began.Here the
Federal retreat, in turn, was halted by General Pope with reenforcements.The Confederates moving up their batteries, a short-range artillery fight
was kept up until midnight.At daylight it was found that Ewell and
Jackson had fallen back two miles farther up the mountain.Pope advanced
to the former Confederate ground and rested, after burying the dead.The
following morning the Confederates had disappeared.The loss to both
armies was almost three thousand in killed, wounded and missing.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: SURVIVORS OF THE FIGHTING TENTH

    The battle was indeed one of which General Lee had good reason to be
    proud.It would be hard to find a better instance of that masterly
    comprehension of the actual condition of things which marks a great
    general than was exhibited in General Lee's allowing our formidable
    attack, in which more than half the Federal army was taking part, to
    be fully developed and to burst upon the exhausted troops of Stonewall
    Jackson, while Lee, relying upon the ability of that able soldier to
    maintain his position, was maturing and arranging for the great attack
    on our left flank by the powerful corps of Longstreet.--_John C.
    Ropes, in "The Army Under Pope."_


The battle of Cedar Mountain was but a prelude to the far greater one that
was to take place three weeks later on the banks of the little stream that
had given its name, the year before, to the first important battle of the
war; and here again the result to be registered was similar to that of the
preceding year--a result that brought dismay to the people of the North
and exultation to the adherents of the Southern cause.The three
intervening weeks between the battles of Cedar Mountain and the Second
Bull Run were spent in sparring, in marshaling the armed hosts, in heavy
skirmishing and getting position for a final decisive struggle.The respective heroes
were J. E. B. Stuart, the daring Southern cavalry leader, and "Stonewall"
Jackson.Before relating these
incidents, however, we must take a general view of the field.General
Pope's headquarters at this moment were at Culpeper, with a large part of
his army, but he had left much of his personal baggage and many of his
private papers at Catlett's, a station on the Orange and Alexandria
Railroad between Culpeper and Manassas Junction, while his vast store of
army supplies was at the latter place.Pope's great source of uncertainty lay in the fact that he did not know
whether Lee would move against him or would follow McClellan in the
latter's retreat from the Peninsula; nor did he know when the
reenforcements promised from McClellan's army would reach him.Meanwhile
Lee had decided to let McClellan depart in peace and to advance against
Pope, with the whole Confederate army.To this end Longstreet was ordered
to the scene and with his corps he reached Gordonsville on August 13th.A few days later the two Confederate generals, Lee and Longstreet,
ascended to the top of Clark's Mountain, from which, through powerful
field-glasses, they obtained a good view of Culpeper, about twelve miles
away.They saw that Pope's position was weak and determined to attack him
without delay.Lee ordered his army to cross the Rapidan.He also sent a
courier to gallop across the country with an important dispatch to General
Stuart, disclosing his plans.It was now that General Pope met fortune; he
captured the courier and learned of Lee's plans.Pope knew that he was not
in position to meet Lee's army at Culpeper, and he withdrew from that
place and took up a strong position behind the Rappahannock.Lee had
strained every nerve to get at his antagonist before the latter left
Culpeper and before he could be reenforced by McClellan's army.But sudden
rains changed the Rappahannock from a placid stream into a rushing
torrent.The Confederates were delayed and meantime the reenforcements
from the Peninsula began to reach Pope's army.General Reno with a part of
Burnside's corps was on the ground by August 14th.One week later came
Generals Kearny and Reynolds--both splendid leaders, both destined to give
their lives for their country within a year--to join the Army of Virginia
with some thousands of additional fighters from the Army of the Potomac.Lee was completely thwarted in his purpose of attacking Pope before his
reenforcements arrived.He sent the dauntless cavalry
leader, J. E. B. Stuart, to make a raid around the Union army.Stuart did
this effectively, and this was the first of the two notable events of
these weeks of sparring.Crossing the Rappahannock at Waterloo Bridge with
fifteen hundred mounted men as bold and dauntless as himself, Stuart
dashed up the country, riding all day and all night.After the coming of
night on the evening of the 22d, in the midst of a torrential rainstorm,
while the darkness was so intense that every man was guided by the tread
of his brother horsemen, Stuart pounced upon the Federals near Catlett's
Station, overpowered the astonished guard, captured nearly two hundred
prisoners, scattering the remainder of the troops stationed there far and
wide in the darkness, and seized Pope's despatch-book with his plans and
private papers.Stuart took also several hundred fine horses and burned a
large number of wagons laden with supplies.Among his trophies was a fine
uniform cloak and hat which were the personal property of General Pope.These were exchanged on the following day for General Stuart's plumed hat
which a few days before had been left behind by that officer when
surprised by Federal troops.Stuart's bold raid proved a serious misfortune for the Union army.But Lee
had far greater things in store.His next move was to send Jackson to
Pope's rear with a large part of the Confederate army.Stealthily Jackson
led his army westward, shielded by the woods, the thickets, and the low
hills of the Blue Ridge.It was a quiet rural community through which he
passed.The great majority of the simple country folk had never seen an
army, though it is true that for many days the far-away boom of cannon had
reached their ears from the valley of the Rapidan.Now here was a real
army at their very doors.Nor was it a hostile army, for their sympathies
were Southern.With baskets and armfuls of bread and pies and cakes they
cheered as best they could the tattered and hungry men on the march.General Lee in the meantime had kept Longstreet in front of Pope's army on
the Rappahannock to make daily demonstrations and feints and thus to
divert Pope's attention from Jackson's movements and lead him to believe
that he was to be attacked in front."Stonewall" Jackson suddenly, on August 26th, emerged from the Bull Run
Mountains by way of the Thoroughfare Gap and marshaled his clans on the
plains of Manassas, but a few miles from the site of the famous battle of
the year before.He was astonished to find Jackson in his rear, and
he had to decide instantly between two courses to abandon his
communications with Fredericksburg on the one hand, or with Alexandria and
Washington on the other.He decided to keep in touch with Washington at
all hazards.Breaking his camp on the Rappahannock, he hastened with all
speed to lead his forces toward Manassas Junction, where he had stored
vast quantities of provisions and munitions of war.But he was too late to
save them.Jackson had been joined by Stuart and his cavalry.On the
evening of the 26th they were still some miles from Manassas and Trimble
was sent ahead to make sure the capture before Pope's army could arrive.Through the darkness rode these same hardy men who had a few nights before
made their bold raid on Catlett's Station.The
spoils of this capture were great, including three hundred prisoners, one
hundred and seventy-five horses, ten locomotives, seven long trains of
provisions, and vast stores and munitions of war.Next morning the weary and hungry foot soldiers of Jackson's army came
upon the scene and whatever else they did they feasted as only hungry men
can.An eye-witness wrote, "To see a starving man eating lobster-salad
and drinking Rhine wine, barefooted and in tatters, was curious; the
whole thing was incredible."The amazement at the North when the news of the capture of Manassas became
known cannot be described.But the newspapers belittled it, declaring that
it was merely a bold raid and that for any large force to get between
Pope's army and Washington before Pope became aware of the attempt was
simply impossible.But his position was precarious,
nevertheless.Pope was moving toward him with a far larger army, recently
augmented by Heintzelman's corps from the Army of the Potomac, while Fitz
John Porter with an additional force was not far off.It is true that
Longstreet was hastening to the aid of Jackson, but he had to come by the
same route which had brought Jackson--through Thoroughfare Gap--and Pope
thought he saw a great opportunity.If he could only detain Longstreet at
the gap, why should he not crush Jackson with his superior numbers?To
this end he sent orders to Porter, to McDowell, and to Kearny and others
whose forces were scattered about the country, to concentrate during the
night of the 27th and move upon Jackson.McDowell sent Ricketts with a
small force--too small to prevent Longstreet from passing through
Thoroughfare Gap, and hastened to join the main army against Jackson.But
that able commander was not to be caught in a trap.He moved from Manassas
Junction by three roads toward the old battle-field of Bull Run and by
noon on the 28th the whole corps was once more united between Centreville
and Sudley Spring.Late in the day he encountered King's division of
McDowell's corps near the village of Groveton, and a sharp fight was
opened and kept up till an hour after dark.The Confederates were left in
possession of the field.The following day, August 29th, was the first of the two days' battle,
leaving out of account the fight of the evening before and the desultory
fighting of the preceding ten days.General Pope was still hopeful of
crushing Jackson before the arrival of Longstreet, and on the morning of
the 29th he ordered a general advance across Bull Run.As the noon hour
approached a wild shout that arose from Jackson's men told too well of the
arrival of Longstreet.Far away on the hills near Gainesville could be
seen the marching columns of Longstreet, who had passed through the gap in
safety and who was now rushing to the support of Jackson.The Confederate
army was at last to be reunited.Pope had
lost his opportunity of fighting the army of his opponent in sections.The field was almost the same that the opposing forces had occupied a year
and a month before when the first great battle of the war was fought.And
many of them were the same men.Some who had engaged in that first
conflict had gone home and had refused to reenlist; others had found
soldiers' graves since then--but still others on both sides were here
again, no longer the raw recruits that they were before, but, with their
year of hard experience in the field, they were trained soldiers, equal to
any in the world.The two armies faced each other in a line nearly five miles long.There
was heavy fighting here and there along the line from the early morning
hours, but no general engagement until late in the afternoon.The Union
right pressed hard against the Confederate left and by ten o'clock had
forced it back more than a mile.But the Confederates, presently
reenforced in that quarter, hurled heavy masses of infantry against the
Union right and regained much that it had lost.Late in the afternoon
fresh regiments under Kearny and Hooker charged the Confederate left,
which was swept back and rolled in upon the center.But presently the
Southern General Hood, with his famous Texan brigade, rushed forward in a
wild, irresistible dash, pressed Kearny back, captured one gun, several
flags and a hundred prisoners.Night then closed over the scene and the
two armies rested on their arms until the morning.The first day's battle is sometimes called the battle of Groveton, but
usually it is considered as the first half of the second battle of Bull
Run.The Union loss was at least
forty-five hundred men, the Confederate was somewhat larger.Over the gory
field lay multitudes of men, the blue and the gray commingled, who would
dream of battlefields no more.The living men lay down among the dead in
order to snatch a little rest and strength that they might renew the
strife in the morning.It is a strange fact that Lee and Pope each believed that the other would
withdraw his army during the night, and each was surprised in the morning
to find his opponent still on the ground, ready, waiting, defiant.It was
quite certain that on this day, August 30th, there would be a decisive
action and that one of the two armies would be victor and the other
defeated.The two opposing commanders had called in their outlying
battalions and the armies now faced each other in almost full force, the
Confederates with over fifty thousand men and the Union forces exceeding
their opponents by probably fifteen thousand men.The Confederate left
wing was commanded by Jackson, and the right by Longstreet.The extreme
left of the Union army was under Fitz John Porter, who, owing to a
misunderstanding of orders, had not reached the field the day before.The
center was commanded by Heintzelman and the right by Reno.In the early hours of the morning the hills echoed with the firing of
artillery, with which the day was opened.Porter made an infantry attack
in the forenoon, but was met by the enemy in vastly superior numbers and
was soon pressed back in great confusion.As the hours passed one fearful
attack followed another, each side in turn pressing forward and again
receding.In the afternoon a large part of the Union army made a
desperate onslaught on the Confederate left under Jackson.Here for some
time the slaughter of men was fearful.Jackson saw
that his lines were wavering.He called for reenforcements which did not
come and it seemed as if the Federals were about to win a signal victory.Far away on a little hill at the Confederate right
Longstreet placed four batteries in such a position that he could enfilade
the Federal columns.Quickly he trained his cannon on the Federal lines
that were hammering away at Jackson, and opened fire.Ghastly gaps were
soon cut in the Federal ranks and they fell back.But they re-formed and
came again and still again, each time only to be mercilessly cut down by
Longstreet's artillery.At length Longstreet's whole line rushed forward,
and with the coming of darkness, the whole Union front began to waver.General Lee, seeing this, ordered the Confederates in all parts of the
field to advance.It was now dark
and there was little more fighting; but Lee captured several thousand
prisoners.Pope retreated across Bull Run with the remnant of his army and
by morning was ensconced behind the field-works at Centreville.There was no mistaking the fact that General Pope had lost the battle and
the campaign.He decided to lead his army back to the entrenchments of
Washington.After spending a day behind the embankments at Centreville,
the retreat was begun.Lee's troops with Jackson in the advance pursued
and struck a portion of the retreating army at Chantilly.It was late in the afternoon of September 1st.The rain, accompanied by
vivid lightning and terrific crashes of thunder, was falling in torrents
as Stuart's horsemen, sent in advance, were driven back by the Federal
infantry.Jackson now pushed two of A. P. Hill's brigades forward to
ascertain the condition of the Union army.General Reno was protecting
Pope's right flank, and he lost no time in proceeding against Hill.The
latter was promptly checked, and both forces took position for battle.One side and then the other fell back in turn as lines were re-formed and
urged forward.Night fell and the tempest's fury increased.The ammunition
of both armies was so wet that much of it could not be used.Try as they
would the Confederates were unable to break the Union line and the two
armies finally withdrew.The Confederates suffered a loss of five hundred
men in their unsuccessful attempt to demoralize Pope in his retreat, and
the Federals more than a thousand, including Generals Stevens and Kearny.General Kearny might have been saved but for his reckless bravery.He was
rounding up the retreat of his men in the darkness of the night when he
chanced to come within the Confederate lines.Called on to surrender, he
lay flat on his horse's back, sank his spurs into its sides, and attempted
to escape.Half a dozen muskets were leveled and fired at the fleeing
general.Within thirty yards he rolled from his horse's back dead.The consternation in Washington and throughout the North when Pope's
defeated army reached Arlington Heights can better be imagined than
described.General Pope, who bore the brunt of public indignation, begged
to be relieved of the command.The President complied with his wishes and
the disorganized remnants of the Army of Virginia and the Army of the
Potomac were handed to the "Little Napoleon" of Peninsula fame, George B.
McClellan.The South was overjoyed with its victory--twice it had unfurled its banner
in triumph on the battlefield at Manassas by the remarkable strategy of
its generals and the courage of its warriors on the firing-line.Twice it
had stood literally on the road that led to the capital of the Republic,
only by some strange destiny of war to fail to enter its precincts on the
wave of victory.[Illustration: THE UNHEEDED WARNING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here we see Catlett's Station, on the Orange & Alexandria Railroad, which
Stuart's cavalry seized in a night sortie on August 22, 1862.Stuart was unable to burn the loaded wagon-trains
surrounding the station and had to content himself with capturing horses,
which he mounted with wounded Federal soldiers; he escaped at four the
next morning, driven off by the approach of a superior force.Pope, at the
time, was in possession of the fords of the Rappahannock, trying to check
the Confederate advance toward the Shenandoah.Stuart's raid, however, so
alarmed General Halleck that he immediately telegraphed Pope from
Washington: "By no means expose your railroad communication with
Alexandria.It is of the utmost importance in sending your supplies and
reinforcements."Pope did not fall back upon his railroad communication,
however, until after Jackson had seized Manassas Junction.[Illustration: CATLETT'S STATION]

At Manassas Junction, as it appeared in the upper picture on August 26,
1862, is one of the great neglected strategic points in the theater of the
war.Twenty-five miles from Alexandria and thirty miles in a direct line
from Washington, it was almost within long cannon-shot from any point in
both the luckless battles of Bull Run.It was on the railway route
connecting with Richmond, and at the junction of the railway running
across the entrance to the Shenandoah Valley and beyond the Blue Ridge,
through Manassas Gap.The Confederates knew its value, and after the first
battle of Bull Run built the fortifications which we see in the upper
picture, to the left beyond the supply-cars on the railroad.Pope, after
the battle of Cedar Mountain, should have covered it, extending his lines
so as to protect it from Jackson's incursion through Thoroughfare Gap;
instead he held the main force of his army opposing that of Lee.[Illustration: WHERE THE THUNDERBOLT FELL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The havoc wrought by the Confederate attack of August 26th on the Federal
supply depot at Manassas Junction is here graphically preserved.When
Jackson arrived at sunset of that day at Bristoe's Station, on the Orange
& Alexandria Railroad, he knew that his daring movement would be reported
to Pope's forces by the trains that escaped both north and south.To save
themselves, the troops that had already marched twenty-five miles had to
make still further exertions.Trimble volunteered to move on Manassas
Junction; and, under command of Stuart, a small force moved northward
through the woods.At midnight it arrived within half a mile of the
Junction.The Federal force greeted it with artillery fire, but when the
Confederates charged at the sound of the bugle the gunners abandoned the
batteries to the assaulters.Some three hundred of the small Federal
garrison were captured, with the immense stores that filled the warehouses
to overflowing.The next morning Hill's and Taliaferro's divisions arrived
to hold the position.The half-starved troops were now in possession of
all that was needed to make them an effective force.Jackson was now in
position to control the movements of the Federal army under Pope.[Illustration: GUARDING THE "O.NEAR UNION MILLS

and the single-track railroad was inadequate.[Illustration: DEBRIS FROM JACKSON'S RAID ON THE ORANGE AND ALEXANDRIA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This is part of the result of General Pope's too rapid advance to head off
Lee's army south of the Rappahannock River.Although overtaking the
advance of the Confederates at Cedar Mountain, Pope had arrived too late
to close the river passes against them.Meanwhile he had left the Orange &
Alexandria Railroad uncovered, and Jackson pushed a large force under
General Ewell forward across the Bull Run Mountains.On the night of
August 26, 1863, Ewell's forces captured Manassas Junction, while four
miles above the Confederate cavalry fell upon an empty railroad train
returning from the transfer of Federal troops.Here we see how well the work was done.THE TRAIN "STONEWALL" JACKSON AND STUART STOPPED AT BRISTOE

[Illustration]

By a move of unparalleled boldness, "Stonewall" Jackson, with twenty
thousand men, captured the immense Union supplies at Manassas Junction,
August 26, 1862.Washington lay one day's
march to the north; Warrenton, Pope's headquarters, but twelve miles
distant to the southwest; and along the Rappahannock, between "Stonewall"
Jackson and Lee, stood the tents of another host which outnumbered the
whole Confederate army."Stonewall" Jackson had seized Bristoe Station in
order to break down the railway bridge over Broad Run, and to proceed at
his leisure with the destruction of the stores.A train returning empty
from Warrenton Junction to Alexandria darted through the station under
heavy fire.Two trains which followed in
the same direction as the first went crashing down a high embankment.The
report received at Alexandria from the train which escaped ran as follows:
"No.6 train, engine Secretary, was fired into at Bristoe by a party of
cavalry some five hundred strong.They had piled ties on the track, but
the engine threw them off.It
was a full day before the Federals realized that "Stonewall" Jackson was
really there with a large force.Here, in abundance, was all that had been
absent for some time; besides commissary stores of all sorts, there were
two trains loaded with new clothing, to say nothing of sutler's stores,
replete with "extras" not enumerated in the regulations, and also the camp
of a cavalry regiment which had vacated in favor of Jackson's men.It was
an interesting sight to see the hungry, travel-worn men attacking this
profusion and rewarding themselves for all their fatigues and deprivations
of the preceding few days, and their enjoyment of it and of the day's rest
allowed them.There was a great deal of difficulty for a time in finding
what each man needed most, but this was overcome through a crude barter of
belongings as the day wore on.[Illustration]


[Illustration: A START TOO LONG DELAYED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Where the troops of General McClellan, waiting near the round-house at
Alexandria, were hurried forward to the scene of action where Pope was
struggling with Jackson and Ewell.Pope had counted upon the assistance of
these reenforcements in making the forward movement by which he expected
to hold Lee back.The old bogey of leaving the National Capital
defenseless set up a vacillation in General Halleck's mind and the troops
were held overlong at Alexandria.Had they been promptly forwarded,
"Stonewall" Jackson's blow at Manassas Junction could not have been
struck.At the news of that disaster the troops were hurriedly despatched
down the railroad toward Manassas.But Pope was already in retreat in
three columns toward that point, McDowell had failed to intercept the
Confederate reenforcements coming through Thoroughfare Gap, and the
situation had become critical.General Taylor, with his brigade of New
Jersey troops, was the first of McClellan's forces to be moved forward to
the aid of Pope.At Union Mills, Colonel Scammon, commanding the First
Brigade, driven back from Manassas Junction, was further pressed by the
Confederates on the morning of August 27th.Later in the day General
Taylor's brigade arrived by the Fairfax road and, crossing the railroad
bridge, met the Confederates drawn up and waiting near Manassas Station.A
severe artillery fire greeted the Federals as they emerged from the woods.As General Taylor had no artillery, he was obliged either to retire or
charge.When the Confederate cavalry threatened to
surround his small force, however, Taylor fell back in good order across
the bridge, where two Ohio regiments assisted in holding the Confederates
in check.At this point, General Taylor, who had been wounded in the
retreat, was borne past in a litter.Though suffering much, he appealed to
the officers to prevent another Bull Run.The brigade retired in good
order to Fairfax Court House, where General Taylor died of his wounds a
short time afterward.[Illustration: BRIGADIER-GENERAL GEORGE W. TAYLOR]


[Illustration: AN UNREALIZED OPPORTUNITY]

Here might have been won a Federal victory that would have precluded
defeat at Second Bull Run.The corps of General Heintzelman, consisting of
the divisions of Hooker and Kearny, was the next detachment of McClellan's
forces to arrive to the aid of Pope.On the 28th of August, Heintzelman
had pushed forward to Centreville, entering it soon after "Stonewall"
Jackson's rear-guard had retired.Instead of pursuing, Heintzelman drew up
his forces east of Cub Run, which we see in the picture.Jackson's forces,
now in a precarious position, fell back toward Thoroughfare Gap to form a
junction with Longstreet's Corps, which Lee had sent forward.The battle
was commenced on the west somewhat feebly by Generals McDowell and Sigel.By nightfall the Confederate left had been driven back fully a mile.[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SAMUEL P. HEINTZELMAN AND STAFF

Sleeping on their arms on the night of August 29th, the Federal veterans
were as confident of having won a victory as were the raw troops in the
beginning of the first battle of Bull Run.But the next day's fighting was
to tell the tale.General Ewell had been wounded in the knee by a minie
ball in the severe fight at Groveton and was unable to lead his command;
but for the impetuosity of this commander was substituted that of
Longstreet, nicknamed "the War-Horse," whose arrival in the midst of the
previous day's engagement had cost the Federals dear.On the morning of
the second day Longstreet's batteries opened the engagement.When the
general advance came, as the sun shone on the parallel lines of glittering
bayonets, it was Longstreet's men bringing their muskets to "the ready"
who first opened fire with a long flash of flame.It was they who pressed
most eagerly forward and, in the face of the Federal batteries, fell upon
the troops of General McDowell at the left and drove them irresistibly
back.Although the right Federal wing, in command of General Heintzelman,
had not given an inch, it was this turning of the left by Longstreet which
put the whole Federal army in retreat, driving them across Bull Run.The
Confederates were left in possession of the field, where lay thousands of
Federal dead and wounded, and Lee was free to advance his victorious
troops into the North unmolested.[Illustration: THE BATTLE-FIELD OF SECOND BULL RUN (MANASSAS), AUGUST

ANTIETAM, OR SHARPSBURG

    At Sharpsburg (Antietam) was sprung the keystone of the arch upon
    which the Confederate cause rested.--_James Longstreet,
    Lieutenant-General C. S. A., in "Battles and Leaders of the Civil
    War."_


A battle remarkable in its actualities but more wonderful in its
possibilities was that of Antietam, with the preceding capture of Harper's
Ferry and the other interesting events that marked the invasion of
Maryland by General Lee.It was one of the bloodiest and the most
picturesque conflicts of the Civil War, and while it was not all that the
North was demanding and not all that many military critics think it might
have been, it enabled President Lincoln to feel that he could with some
assurance issue, as he did, his Emancipation Proclamation.Lee's army, fifty thousand strong, had crossed the Potomac at Leesburg and
had concentrated around Frederick, the scene of the Barbara Frietchie
legend, only forty miles from Washington.When it became known that Lee,
elated by his victory at Second Bull Run, had taken the daring step of
advancing into Maryland, and now threatened the capital of the Republic,
McClellan, commanding the Army of the Potomac, pushed his forces forward
to encounter the invaders.Harper's Ferry, at the junction of the Potomac
and the Shenandoah rivers, was a valuable defense against invasion through
the Valley of Virginia, but once the Confederates had crossed it, a
veritable trap.General Halleck ordered it held and General Lee sent
"Stonewall" Jackson to take it, by attacking the fortress on the Virginia
side.Jackson began his march on September 10th with secret instructions from
his commander to encompass and capture the Federal garrison and the vast
store of war material at this place, made famous a few years before by old
John Brown.To conceal his purpose from the inhabitants he inquired along
the route about the roads leading into Pennsylvania.It was from his march
through Frederick that the Barbara Frietchie story took its rise.But
there is every reason to believe that General Jackson never saw the good
old lady, that the story is a myth, and that Mr.Whittier, who has given
us the popular poem under the title of her name, was misinformed.However,
Colonel H. K. Douglas, who was a member of Jackson's staff, relates, in
"Battles and Leaders of the Civil War," an interesting incident where his
commander on entering Middletown was greeted by two young girls waving a
Union flag.The general bowed to the young women, raised his hat, and
remarked to some of his officers, "We evidently have no friends in this
town."Colonel Douglas concludes, "This is about the way he would have
treated Barbara Frietchie."On the day after Jackson left Frederick he crossed the Potomac by means of
a ford near Williamsport and on the 13th he reached Bolivar Heights.Harper's Ferry lies in a deep basin formed by Maryland Heights on the
north bank of the Potomac, Loudon Heights on the south bank, and Bolivar
Heights on the west.The Shenandoah River breaks through the pass between
Loudon and Bolivar Heights and the village lies between the two at the
apex formed by the junction of the two rivers.As Jackson approached the place by way of Bolivar Heights, Walker occupied
Loudon Heights and McLaws invested Maryland Heights.All were unopposed
except McLaws, who encountered Colonel Ford with a force to dispute his
ascent.Ford, however, after some resistance, spiked his guns and retired
to the Ferry, where Colonel Miles had remained with the greater portion of
the Federal troops.Had Miles led his entire force to Maryland Heights he
could no doubt have held his ground until McClellan came to his relief.But General Halleck had ordered him to hold Harper's Ferry to the last,
and Miles interpreted this order to mean that he must hold the town
itself.He therefore failed to occupy the heights around it in sufficient
strength and thus permitted himself to be caught in a trap.During the day of the 14th the Confederate artillery was dragged up the
mountain sides, and in the afternoon a heavy fire was opened on the doomed
Federal garrison.On that day McClellan received word from Miles that the
latter could hold out for two days longer and the commanding general sent
word: "Hold out to the last extremity.If it is possible, reoccupy the
Maryland Heights with your entire force.If you can do that I will
certainly be able to relieve you.... Hold out to the last."McClellan was
approaching slowly and felt confident he could relieve the place.On the morning of the 15th the roar of Confederate artillery again
resounded from hill to hill.From Loudon to Maryland Heights the firing
had begun and a little later the battle-flags of A. P. Hill rose on
Bolivar Heights.Scarcely two hours had the firing continued when Colonel
Miles raised the white flag at Harper's Ferry and its garrison of 12,500,
with vast military stores, passed into the hands of the Confederates.Colonel Miles was struck by a stray fragment of a Confederate shell which
gave him a mortal wound.The force of General Franklin, preparing to move
to the garrison's relief, on the morning of the 15th noted that firing at
the Ferry had ceased and suspected that the garrison had surrendered, as
it had.The Confederate Colonel Douglas, whose account of the surrender is both
absorbing and authoritative, thus describes the surrender in "Battles and
Leaders of the Civil War":

"Under instructions from General Jackson, I rode up the pike and into the
enemy's lines to ascertain the purpose of the white flag.Near the top of
the hill I met General White and staff and told him my mission.He replied
that Colonel Miles had been mortally wounded, that he was in command and
desired to have an interview with General Jackson.... I conducted them to
General Jackson, whom I found sitting on his horse where I had left
him.... The contrast in appearances there presented was striking.General
White, riding a handsome black horse, was carefully dressed and had on
untarnished gloves, boots, and sword.His staff were equally comely in
costume.On the other hand, General Jackson was the dingiest,
worst-dressed and worst-mounted general that a warrior who cared for good
looks and style would wish to surrender to."General Jackson... rode up to Bolivar and down into Harper's Ferry.The
curiosity in the Union army to see him was so great that the soldiers
lined the sides of the road.... One man had an echo of response all about
him when he said aloud: 'Boys, he's not much for looks, but if we'd had
him we wouldn't have been caught in this trap.'"McClellan had failed to reach Harper's Ferry in time to relieve it because
he was detained at South Mountain by a considerable portion of Lee's army
under D. H. Hill and Longstreet.McClellan had come into possession of
Lee's general order, outlining the campaign.Discovering by this order
that Lee had sent Jackson to attack Harper's Ferry he made every effort to
relieve it.The affair at Harper's Ferry, as that at South Mountain, was but a prelude
to the tremendous battle that was to follow two days later on the banks of
the little stream called Antietam Creek, in Maryland.When it was known
that Lee had led his army across the Potomac the people were filled with
consternation--the people, not only of the immediate vicinity, but of
Harrisburg, of Baltimore, of Philadelphia.Their fear was intensified by
the memory of the Second Bull Run of a few weeks earlier, and by the fact
that at this very time General Bragg was marching northward across
Kentucky with a great army, menacing Louisville and Cincinnati.As one year before, the hopes of the North had centered in George B.
McClellan, so it was now with the people of the East.They were ready to
forget his failure to capture Richmond in the early summer and to contrast
his partial successes on the Peninsula with the drastic defeat of his
successor at the Second Bull Run.When McClellan, therefore, passed through Maryland to the scene of the
coming battle, many of the people received him with joy and enthusiasm.At
Frederick City, he tells us in his "Own Story," he was "nearly overwhelmed
and pulled to pieces," and the people invited him into their houses and
gave him every demonstration of confidence.The first encounter, a double one, took place on September 14th, at two
passes of South Mountain, a continuation of the Blue Ridge, north of the
Potomac.General Franklin, who had been sent to relieve Harper's Ferry,
met a Confederate force at Crampton's Gap and defeated it in a sharp
battle of three hours' duration.Meanwhile, the First and Ninth Army
Corps, under Burnside, encountered a stronger force at Turner's Gap seven
miles farther up.The battle here continued many hours, till late in the
night, and the Union troops were victorious.Lee's loss was nearly twenty-seven hundred, of whom eight hundred were
prisoners.The Federals lost twenty-one hundred men and they failed to
save Harper's Ferry.Lee now placed Longstreet and D. H. Hill in a strong position near
Keedysville, but learning that McClellan was advancing rapidly, the
Confederate leader decided to retire to Sharpsburg, where he could be more
easily joined by Jackson.September 16th was a day of intense anxiety and
unrest in the valley of the Antietam.The people who had lived in the
farmhouses that dotted the golden autumn landscape in this hitherto quiet
community had now abandoned their homes and given place to the armed
forces.It was a day of marshaling and maneuvering of the gathering
thousands, preparatory to the mighty conflict that was clearly seen to be
inevitable.Lee had taken a strong position on the west bank of Antietam
Creek a few miles from where it flows into the Potomac.He made a display
of force, exposing his men to the fire of the Federal artillery, his
object being to await the coming of Jackson's command from Harper's Ferry.It is true that Jackson himself had arrived, but his men were weary with
marching and, moreover, a large portion of his troops under A. P. Hill and
McLaws had not yet reached the field.McClellan spent the day arranging his corps and giving directions for
planting batteries.With a few companions he rode along the whole front,
frequently drawing the fire of the Confederate batteries and thus
revealing their location.The right wing of his army, the corps of
Generals Hooker, Mansfield, and Sumner, lay to the north, near the village
of Keedysville.General Porter with two divisions of the Fifth Corps
occupied the center and Burnside was on the left of the Union lines.Back
of McClellan's lines was a ridge on which was a signal station commanding
a view of the entire field.Late on the afternoon of the 16th, Hooker
crossing the Antietam, advanced against Hood's division on the Confederate
left.For several hours there was heavy skirmishing, which closed with the
coming of darkness.The two great armies now lay facing each other in a grand double line
three miles in length.At one point (the Union right and the Confederate
left) they were so near together that the pickets could hear each other's
tread.It required no prophet to foretell what would happen on the morrow.Beautiful and clear the morning broke over the Maryland hills on the
fateful 17th of September, 1862.The sunlight had not yet crowned the
hilltops when artillery fire announced the opening of the battle.Hooker's
infantry soon entered into the action and encountered the Confederates in
an open field, from which the latter were presently pressed back across
the Hagerstown pike to a line of woods where they made a determined stand.Hooker then called on General Mansfield to come to his aid, and the latter
quickly did so, for he had led his corps across the Antietam after dark
the night before.Mansfield, however, a gallant and honored veteran, fell
mortally wounded while deploying his troops, and General Alpheus S.
Williams, at the head of his first division, succeeded to the command.There was a wood west of the Sharpsburg and Hagerstown turnpike which,
with its outcropping ledges of rock, formed an excellent retreat for the
Confederates and from this they pushed their columns into the open fields,
chiefly of corn, to meet the Union attacks.For about two hours the battle
raged at this point, the lines swaying to and fro, with fearful slaughter
on both sides.At length, General Greene, who commanded a division of the
fallen Mansfield's corps, gained possession of part of the coveted forest,
near a little white church, known as the Dunker's Chapel.This was on high
ground and was the key to the Confederate left wing.But Greene's troops
were exposed to a galling fire from D. H. Hill's division and he called
for reenforcements.General Sumner then sent Sedgwick's division across the stream and
accompanied the troops to the aid of their hard-pressed comrades.And the
experience of this body of the gallant Second Corps during the next hour
was probably the most thrilling episode of the whole day's battle.Sedgwick's troops advanced straight toward the conflict.They found Hooker
wounded and his and Williams' troops quite exhausted.A sharp artillery
fire was turned on Sedgwick before he reached the woods west of the
Hagerstown pike, but once in the shelter of the thick trees he passed in
safety to the western edge.Heavy Confederate reenforcements--ten brigades, in fact--Walker's men, and
McLaws', having arrived from Harper's Ferry--were hastening up, and they
not only blocked the front, but worked around to the rear of Sedgwick's
isolated brigades.Sedgwick was wounded in the awful slaughter that
followed, but he and Sumner finally extricated their men with a loss of
two thousand, over three hundred left dead on the ghastly field.Franklin
now sent forward some fresh troops and after obstinately fighting, the
Federals finally held a cornfield and most of the coveted wood over which
the conflict had raged till the ground was saturated with blood.Before the close of this bloody conflict on the Union right another,
almost if not quite as deadly, was in progress near the center.General
French, soon joined by General Richardson, both of Sumner's corps, crossed
the stream and made a desperate assault against the Southerners of D. H.
Hill's division, stationed to the south of where the battle had previously
raged--French on a line of heights strongly held by the Confederates,
Richardson in the direction of a sunken road, since known as "Bloody
Lane."The fighting here was of a most desperate character and continued
nearly four hours.French captured a few flags, several hundred prisoners,
and gained some ground, but he failed to carry the heights.Richardson was
mortally wounded while leading a charge and was succeeded by General
Hancock; but his men finally captured Bloody Lane with the three hundred
living men who had remained to defend it.The final Federal charge at this
point was made by Colonel Barlow, who displayed the utmost bravery and
self-possession in the thickest of the fight, where he won a
brigadier-generalship.He was wounded, and later carried off the field.The Confederates had fought desperately to hold their position in Bloody
Lane, and when it was captured it was filled with dead bodies.It was now
about one o'clock and the infantry firing ceased for the day on the Union
right, and center.Let us now look on the other part of the field.Burnside held the Federal
left wing against Lee's right, and he remained inactive for some hours
after the battle had begun at the other end of the line.In front of
Burnside was a triple-arched stone bridge across the Antietam, since known
as "Burnside's Bridge."Opposite this bridge, on the <DW72> which extends
to a high ridge, were Confederate breastworks and rifle-pits, which
commanded the bridge with a direct or enfilading fire.While the Federal
right was fighting on the morning of the 17th, McClellan sent an order to
Burnside to advance on the bridge, to take possession of it and cross the
stream by means of it.It must have been about ten o'clock when Burnside
received the order as McClellan was more than two miles away.Burnside's chief officer at this moment was General Jacob D. Cox
(afterward Governor of Ohio), who had succeeded General Reno, killed at
South Mountain.On Cox fell the task of capturing the stone bridge.The
defense of the bridge was in the hands of General Robert Toombs, a former
United States senator and a member of Jefferson Davis' Cabinet.Perhaps
the most notable single event in the life of General Toombs was his
holding of the Burnside Bridge at Antietam for three hours against the
assaults of the Federal troops.The Confederates had been weakened at this
point by the sending of Walker to the support of Jackson, where, as we
have noticed, he took part in the deadly assault upon Sedgwick's division.Toombs, therefore, with his one brigade had a heavy task before him in
defending the bridge with his small force, notwithstanding his advantage
of position.McClellan sent several urgent orders to advance at all hazards.Burnside
forwarded these to Cox, and in the fear that the latter would be unable to
carry the bridge by a direct front attack, he sent Rodman with a division
to cross the creek by a ford some distance below.Meanwhile, in rapid succession, one assault after
another was made upon the bridge and, about one o'clock, it was carried,
at the cost of five hundred men.A lull in the
fighting along the whole line of battle now ensued.Burnside, however, received another order from McClellan to push on up the
heights and to the village of Sharpsburg.The great importance of this
move, if successful, was that it would cut Lee out from his line of
retreat by way of Shepherdstown.After replenishing the ammunition and adding some fresh troops, Cox
advanced at three o'clock with the utmost gallantry toward Sharpsburg.The
Confederates disputed the ground with great bravery.But Cox swept all
before him and was at the edge of the village when he was suddenly
confronted by lines in blue uniforms who instantly opened fire.The
Federals were astonished to see the blue-clad battalions before them.They
must be Union soldiers; but how did they get there?They were A. P. Hill's division of Lee's army which had just
arrived from Harper's Ferry, and they had dressed themselves in the
uniforms that they had taken from the Federal stores.Hill had come just in time to save Lee's headquarters from capture.He
checked Cox's advance, threw a portion of the troops into great confusion,
and steadily pressed them back toward the Antietam.In this, the end of
the battle, General Rodman fell mortally wounded.Cox retired in good
order and Sharpsburg remained in the hands of the Confederates.Thus, with the approach of nightfall, closed the memorable battle of
Antietam.For fourteen long hours more than one hundred thousand men, with
five hundred pieces of artillery, had engaged in titanic combat.As the
pall of battle smoke rose and cleared away, the scene presented was one to
make the stoutest heart shudder.There lay upon the ground, scattered for
three miles over the valleys and the hills or in the improvised hospitals,
more than twenty thousand men.Horace Greeley was probably right in
pronouncing this the bloodiest day in American history.Although tactically it was a drawn battle, Antietam was decisively in
favor of the North inasmuch as it ended the first Confederate attempt at a
Northern invasion.General Lee realized that his ulterior plans had been
thwarted by this engagement and after a consultation with his corps
commanders he determined to withdraw from Maryland.On the night of the
18th the retreat began and early the next morning the Confederate army had
all safely recrossed the Potomac.The great mistake of the Maryland campaign from the standpoint of the
Confederate forces, thought General Longstreet, was the division of Lee's
army, and he believed that if Lee had kept his forces together he would
not have been forced to abandon the campaign.At Antietam, he had less
than forty thousand men, who were in poor condition for battle while
McClellan had about eighty-seven thousand, most of whom were fresh and
strong, though not more than sixty thousand were in action.The moral effect of the battle of Antietam was incalculably great.It
aroused the confidence of the Northern people.It emboldened President
Lincoln to issue five days after its close the proclamation freeing the
slaves in the seceded states.He had written the proclamation long before,
but it had lain inactive in his desk at Washington.All through the
struggles of the summer of 1862 he had looked forward to the time when he
could announce his decision to the people.With the doubtful success of Federal arms, to make such a bold step would
have been a mockery and would have defeated the very end he sought.The South had now struck its first desperate blow at the gateways to the
North.By daring, almost unparalleled in warfare, it had swung its
courageous army into a strategical position where with the stroke of
fortune it might have hammered down the defenses of the National capital
on the south and then sweep on a march of invasion into the North.The
Northern soldiers had parried the blow.They had saved themselves from
disaster and had held back the tide of the Confederacy as it beat against
the Mason and Dixon line, forcing it back into the State of Virginia where
the two mighty fighting bodies were soon to meet again in a desperate
struggle for the right-of-way at Fredericksburg.[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS

ACCORDING TO HIS WIDOW THE ONLY WAR-TIME PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE CONFEDERACY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Thus appeared Jefferson Davis, who on the eve of Antietam was facing one
of the gravest crises of his career.Eighteen months previously, on
February 9, 1861, he had been unanimously elected president of the
Confederate States of America.He maintained
that the secession of the Southern states should be regarded as a purely
peaceful move.But events had swiftly drawn him and his government into
the most stupendous civil conflict of modern times.Now, in September,
1862, he was awaiting the decision of fate.The Southern forces had
advanced northward triumphantly.Elated by success, they were at this
moment invading the territory of the enemy under the leadership of Lee,
whose victories had everywhere inspired not only confidence but enthusiasm
and devotion.Should he overthrow the Northern armies, the Confederacy
would be recognized abroad and its independence probably established at
home.Should he be defeated, no one could foretell the result.From this time the fortunes of the Confederacy waned.[Illustration: LEE LOCKS THE GATES

COPYRIGHT 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Sharpsburg, Maryland, September 17, 1862.There were long minutes on that
sunny day in the early fall of 1862 when Robert E. Lee, at his
headquarters west of Sharpsburg, must have been in almost entire ignorance
of how the battle went.Outnumbered he knew his troops were; outfought he
knew they never would be.Longstreet, Hood, D. H. Hill, Evans, and D. R.
Jones had turned back more than one charge in the morning; but, as the day
wore on, Lee perceived that the center must be held.He had deceived McClellan as to his numerical strength and he must
continue to do so.At one time
General Longstreet reported from the center to General Chilton, Lee's
Chief of Staff, that Cooke's North Carolina regiment--still keeping its
colors at the front--had not a cartridge left.None but veteran troops
could hold a line like this, supported by only two guns of Miller's
battery of the Washington Artillery.Of this crisis in the battle General
Longstreet wrote afterward: "We were already badly whipped and were
holding our ground by sheer force of desperation."Actually in line that
day on the Confederate side were only 37,000 men, and opposed to them were
numbers that could be footed up to 50,000 more.At what time in the day
General Lee must have perceived that the invasion of Maryland must come to
an end cannot be told.He had lost 20,000 of his tired, footsore army by
straggling on the march, according to the report of Longstreet, who adds:
"Nearly one-fourth of the troops who went into the battle were killed or
wounded."At dark Lee's rearward movement had begun.[Illustration: A REGIMENT THAT FOUGHT AT SOUTH MOUNTAIN--THE THIRTY-FIFTH

Early in the morning of September 17, 1862, Knap's battery (shown below)
got into the thick of the action of Antietam.General Mansfield had posted
it opposite the north end of the West Woods, close to the Confederate
line.The guns opened fire at seven o'clock.Practically unsupported, the
battery was twice charged upon during the morning; but quickly
substituting canister for shot and shell, the men held their ground and
stemmed the Confederate advance.Near this spot General Mansfield was
mortally wounded while deploying his troops.About noon a section of
Knap's battery was detached to the assistance of General Greene, in the
East Woods.[Illustration: KNAP'S BATTERY, JUST AFTER THE BLOODY WORK AT ANTIETAM

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.This photograph was taken back of the rail fence on the Hagerstown pike,
where "Stonewall" Jackson's men attempted to rally in the face of Hooker's
ferocious charge that opened the bloodiest day of the Civil War--September
17, 1862.Hooker, advancing to seize high ground nearly three-quarters of
a mile distant, had not gone far before the glint of the rising sun
disclosed the bayonet-points of a large Confederate force standing in a
cornfield in his immediate front.This was a part of Jackson's Corps which
had arrived during the morning of the 16th from the capture of Harper's
Ferry and had been posted in this position to surprise Hooker in his
advance.The outcome was a terrible surprise to the Confederates.All of
Hooker's batteries hurried into action and opened with canister on the
cornfield.The Confederates stood bravely up against this fire, and as
Hooker's men advanced they made a determined resistance.Back and still
farther back were Jackson's men driven across the open field, every stalk
of corn in which was cut down by the battle as closely as a knife could
have done it.On the ground the slain lay in rows precisely as they had
stood in ranks.From the cornfield into a small patch of woods (the West
Woods) the Confederates were driven, leaving the sad result of the
surprise behind them.As the edge of the woods was approached by Hooker's
men the resistance became stronger and more stubborn.Nearly all the units
of two of Jackson's divisions were now in action, and cavalry and
artillery were aiding them."The two lines," says General Palfrey, "almost
tore each other to pieces."General Starke and Colonel Douglas on the
Confederate side were killed.More than half of Lawton's and Hays'
brigades were either killed or wounded.On the Federal side General
Ricketts lost a third of his division.The energy of both forces was
entirely spent and reinforcements were necessary before the battle could
be continued.Many of Jackson's men wore trousers and caps of Federal
blue, as did most of the troops which had been engaged with Jackson in the
affair at Harper's Ferry.A. P. Hill's men, arriving from Harper's Ferry
that same afternoon, were dressed in new Federal uniforms--a part of their
booty--and at first were mistaken for Federals by the friends who were
anxiously awaiting them.[Illustration: THE THRICE-FOUGHT GROUND

Sumner's Second Corps, after passing through the East and entering the
West Woods.This is near where the Confederate General Ewell's division,
reenforced by McLaws and Walker, fell upon Sedgwick's left flank and rear.Nearly two thousand Federal soldiers were struck down, the division losing
during the day more than forty per cent.One
regiment lost sixty per cent.--the highest regimental loss sustained.Later the right of the Confederate line crossed the turnpike at the Dunker
church (about half a mile to the left of the picture) and made two
assaults upon Greene, but they were repulsed with great slaughter.General
D. R. Jones, of Jackson's division, had been wounded.The brave Starke who
succeeded him was killed; and Lawton, who followed Starke, had fallen
wounded.[Illustration: RUIN OF MUMMA'S HOUSE, ANTIETAM]

A flaming mansion was the guidon for the extreme left of Greene's division
when (early in the morning) he had moved forward along the ridge leading
to the East Woods.This dwelling belonged to a planter by the name of
Mumma.It stood in the very center of the Federal advance, and also at the
extreme left of D. H. Hill's line.The house had been fired by the
Confederates, who feared that its thick walls might become a vantage-point
for the Federal infantry.It burned throughout the battle, the flames
subsiding only in the afternoon.Before it, just across the road, a
battery of the First Rhode Island Light Artillery had placed its guns.Twice were they charged, but each time they were repulsed.From Mumma's
house it was less than half a mile across the open field to the Dunker
church.The fence-rails in the upper picture were those of the field
enclosing Mumma's land, and the heroic dead pictured lying there were in
full sight from the burning mansion.[Illustration: THE HARVEST OF "BLOODY LANE"

blow of which the Federals could boast in the day's fighting at Antietam,
September 17, 1862.In the lower picture we see the officers whose work
first began to turn the tide of battle into a decisive advantage which the
Army of the Potomac had every reason to expect would be gained by its
superior numbers.On the Federal right Jackson, with a bare four thousand
men, had taken the fight out of Hooker's eighteen thousand in the morning,
giving ground at last to Sumner's fresh troops.On the Federal left,
Burnside (at the lower bridge) failed to advance against Longstreet's
Corps, two-thirds of which had been detached for service elsewhere.It was
at the center that the forces of French and Richardson, skilfully fought
by their leaders, broke through the Confederate lines and, sweeping beyond
the sunken road, seized the very citadel of the center.Meagher's Irish
Brigade had fought its way to a crest from which a plunging fire could be
poured upon the Confederates in the sunken road.Meagher's ammunition was
exhausted, and Caldwell threw his force into the position and continued
the terrible combat.When the Confederates executed their flanking
movement to the left, Colonel D. R. Cross, of the Fifth New Hampshire,
seized a position which exposed Hill's men to an enfilading fire.(In the

[Illustration: SHERRICK'S HOUSE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In three distinct localities the battle waxed fierce from dawn to dusk on
that terrible day at Antietam, September 17, 1862.First at the Federal
right around the Dunker church; then at the sunken road, where the centers
of both armies spent themselves in sanguinary struggle; lastly, late in
the day, the struggle was renewed and ceased on the Sharpsburg road.When
Burnside finally got his troops in motion, Sturgis' division of the Ninth
Corps was first to cross the creek; his men advanced through an open
ravine under a withering fire till they gained the opposite crest and held
it until reenforced by Wilcox.To their right ran the Sharpsburg road, and
an advance was begun in the direction of the Sherrick house.[Illustration: GENERAL A. P. HILL, C. S.The fighting along the Sharpsburg road might have resulted in a
Confederate disaster had it not been for the timely arrival of the troops
of General A. P. Hill.His six brigades of Confederate veterans had been
the last to leave Harper's Ferry, remaining behind Jackson's main body in
order to attend to the details of the surrender.Just as the Federal Ninth
Corps was in the height of its advance, a cloud of dust on Harper's Ferry
road cheered the Confederates to redoubled effort.Out of the dust the
brigades of Hill debouched upon the field.Their fighting blood seemed to
have but mounted more strongly during their march of eighteen miles.Without waiting for orders, Hill threw his men into the fight and the
progress of the Ninth Corps was stopped.Lee had counted on the arrival of
Hill in time to prevent any successful attempt upon the Confederate right
held by Longstreet's Corps, two-thirds of which had been detached in the
thick of the fighting of the morning, when Lee's left and center suffered
so severely.Burnside's delay at the bridge could not have been more
fortunate for Lee if he had fixed its duration himself.Had the
Confederate left been attacked at the time appointed, the outcome of
Antietam could scarcely have been other than a decisive victory for the
Federals.Even at the time when Burnside's tardy advance began, it must
have prevailed against the weakened and wearied Confederates had not the
fresh troops of A. P. Hill averted the disaster.[Illustration: AFTER THE ADVANCE]

In the advance along the Sharpsburg road near the Sherrick house the 79th
New York "Highlanders" deployed as skirmishers.From orchards and
cornfields and from behind fences and haystacks the Confederate
sharpshooters opened upon them, but they swept on, driving in a part of
Jones' division and capturing a battery just before A. P. Hill's troops
arrived.With these reenforcements the Confederates drove back the brave
Highlanders from the suburbs of Sharpsburg, which they had reached.Stubborn Scotch blood would permit only a reluctant retreat.Sharp
fighting occurred around the Sherrick house with results seen in the lower
picture.[Illustration: THE SEVENTEENTH NEW YORK ARTILLERY DRILLING BEFORE THE

    As it is, the battle of Stone's River seems less clearly a Federal
    victory than the battle of Shiloh.The latter decided the fall of
    Corinth; the former did not decide the fall of Chattanooga.Offensively it was a drawn battle, as looked at from either side.As a
    defensive battle, however, it was clearly a Union victory.--_John
    Fiske in "The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War."_


The battle of Corinth developed a man--William S. Rosecrans--whose
singular skill in planning the battle, and whose dauntless courage in
riding between the firing-lines at the opportune moment, drew the
country's attention almost as fully as Grant had done at Fort Donelson.And at this particular moment the West needed, or thought it needed, a
man.The autumn months of 1862 had been spent by Generals Bragg and Buell
in an exciting race across Kentucky, each at the head of a great army.Buell had saved Louisville from the legions of Bragg, and he had driven
the Confederate Army of the Mississippi from the State; but he had not
prevented his opponent from carrying away a vast amount of plunder, nor
had he won decisive results at the battle of Perryville, which took place
October 8, 1862, four days after the battle of Corinth.Thereupon the
Federal authorities decided to relieve Buell of the Army of the Ohio and
to give it to General Rosecrans.On October 30, 1862, Rosecrans assumed command at Nashville of this force,
which was now designated as the Army of the Cumberland.Bragg had
concentrated his army at Murfreesboro, in central Tennessee, about thirty
miles southeast of Nashville and a mile east of a little tributary of the
Cumberland River called Stone's River.Here occurred, two months later,
the bloodiest single day's battle in the West, a conflict imminent as
soon as the news came (on December 26th) that the Federals were advancing
from Nashville.General Bragg did not lose a moment in marshaling his army into well-drawn
battle-lines.His army was in two corps with a cavalry division under
General Wheeler, Forrest and Morgan being on detached service.The left
wing, under General Hardee, and the center, under Polk, were sent across
Stone's River, the right wing, a division under John C. Breckinridge,
remaining on the eastern side of the stream to guard the town.The line
was three miles in length, and on December 30th the Federal host that had
come from Nashville stood opposite, in a parallel line.The left wing, opposite Breckinridge, was commanded by
Thomas L. Crittenden, whose brother was a commander in the Confederacy.They were sons of the famous United States senator from Kentucky, John J.
Crittenden.The Federal center, opposite Polk, was commanded by George H.
Thomas, and the right wing, opposing the Confederate left, was led by
Alexander McD.McCook, one of the well-known "Fighting McCook" brothers.The effective Federal force was about forty-three thousand men; the
Confederate army numbered about thirty-eight thousand.That night they
bivouacked within musket range of each other and the camp-fires of each
were clearly seen by the other as they shone through the cedar groves that
interposed.Thus lay the two great armies, ready to spring upon each other
in deadly combat with the coming of the morning.Rosecrans had permitted McCook to thin out his lines over too much space,
while on that very part of the field Bragg had concentrated his forces for
the heaviest attack.The plans of battle made by the two opposing
commanders were strikingly similar.Rosecrans' plan was to throw his left
wing, under Crittenden, across the river upon the Confederate right under
Breckinridge, to crush it in one impetuous dash, and to swing around
through Murfreesboro to the Franklin road and cut off the Confederate
line of retreat.Bragg, on the other hand, intended to make a similar dash
upon the Union right, pivot upon his center, press back McCook upon that
center, crumpling the Federals and seizing the Nashville turnpike to cut
off Rosecrans' retreat toward Nashville.Neither, of course, knew of the
other's plan, and much would depend on who would strike first.At the early light of the last day of the year the Confederate left wing
moved upon the Union right in a magnificent battle-line, three-quarters of
a mile in length and two columns deep.At the same time the Confederate
artillery opened with their cannon.McCook was astonished at so fierce and
sudden a charge.The gallant Patrick Cleburne, one of the ablest
commanders in the Southern armies, led his division, which had been
brought from the Confederate right, in the charge.The Federal lines were
ill prepared for this sudden onslaught, and before McCook could arrange
them several batteries were overpowered and eleven of the heavy guns were
in the hands of the Confederates.Slowly the Union troops fell back, firing as they went; but they had no
power to check the impetuous, overwhelming charge of the onrushing foe.McCook's two right divisions, under Johnson and Jeff.C. Davis, were
driven back, but his third division, which was commanded by a young
officer who had attracted unusual attention at the battle of
Perryville--Philip H. Sheridan--held its ground.At the first Confederate
advance, Sill's brigade of Sheridan's division drove the troops in front
of it back into their entrenchments, and in the charge the brave Sill lost
his life.While the battle raged with tremendous fury on the Union right, Rosecrans
was three miles away, throwing his left across the river.Hearing the
terrific roar of battle at the other end of the line, Rosecrans hastened
to begin his attack on Breckinridge hoping to draw a portion of the
Confederate force away from McCook.But as the hours of the forenoon
passed he was dismayed as he noted that the sound of battle was coming
nearer, and he rightly divined that his right wing was receding before the
dashing soldiers of the South.He ordered McCook to dispute every inch of
the ground; but McCook's command was soon torn to pieces and disorganized,
except the division of Sheridan.The latter stood firm against the overwhelming numbers, a stand that
attracted the attention of the country and brought him military fame.He
checked the onrushing Confederates at the point of the bayonet; he formed
a new line under fire.In his first position Sheridan held his ground for
two hours.The Confederate attack had also fallen heavily on Negley, who
was stationed on Sheridan's left, and on Palmer, both of Thomas' center.Rousseau commanding the reserves, and Van Cleve of Crittenden's forces
were ordered to the support of the Union center and right.Here, for two
hours longer the battle raged with unabated fury, and the slaughter of
brave men on both sides was appalling.Three times the whole Confederate
left and center were thrown against the Union divisions, but failed to
break the lines.At length when their cartridge boxes were empty
Sheridan's men could do nothing but retire for more ammunition, and they
did this in good order to a rolling plain near the Nashville road.But
Rousseau of Thomas' center was there to check the Confederate advance.It was now past noon, and still the battle roar resounded unceasingly
through the woods and hills about Murfreesboro.Though both hosts had
struggled and suffered since early morning, they still held to their guns,
pouring withering volleys into each other's ranks.The Federal right and
center had been forced back at right angles to the position they had held
when day dawned; and the Confederate left was swung around at right angles
to its position of the morning.The Federal left rested on Stone's River,
while Bragg's right was on the same stream and close to the line in blue.Meantime, Rosecrans had massed his artillery on a little hill overlooking
the field of action.He had also re-formed the broken lines of the right
and center and called in twelve thousand fresh troops.Then, after a brief
lull, the battle opened again and the ranks of both sides were torn with
grape and canister and bursting shells.In answer to Bragg's call for reenforcements came Breckinridge with all
but one brigade of his division, a host of about seven thousand fresh
troops.The new Confederate attack began slowly, but increased its speed
at every step.Suddenly, a thundering volley burst from the line in blue,
and the front ranks of the attacking column disappeared.Again, a volley
tore through the ranks in gray, and the assault was abandoned.The battle had raged for nearly eleven hours, when night enveloped the
scene, and the firing abated slowly and died away.It had been a bloody
day--this first day's fight at Stone's River--and except at Antietam it
had not thus far been surpassed in the war.The advantage was clearly with
the Confederates.They had pressed back the Federals for two miles, had
routed their right wing and captured many prisoners and twenty-eight heavy
guns.But Rosecrans determined to hold his ground and try again.The next day was New Year's and but for a stray fusillade, here and there,
both armies remained inactive, except that each quietly prepared to renew
the contest on the morrow.The renewal of the battle on January 2nd was
fully expected on both sides, but there was little fighting till four in
the afternoon.Rosecrans had sent General Van Cleve's division on January
1st across the river to seize an elevation from which he could shell the
town of Murfreesboro.Bragg now sent Breckinridge to dislodge the
division, and he did so with splendid effect.But Breckinridge's men came
into such a position as to be exposed to the raking fire of fifty-two
pieces of Federal artillery on the west side of the river.Returning the
deadly and constant fire as best they could, they stood the storm of shot
and shell for half an hour when they retreated to a place of safety,
leaving seventeen hundred of their number dead or wounded on the field.That night the two armies again lay within musket shot of each other.The
next day brought no further conflict and during that night General Bragg
moved away to winter quarters at Shelbyville, on the Elk River.Murfreesboro, or Stone's River, was one of the great battles of the war.The losses were about thirteen thousand to the Federals and over ten
thousand to the Confederates.Both sides claimed victory--the South
because of Bragg's signal success on the first day; the North because of
Breckinridge's fearful repulse at the final onset and of Bragg's
retreating in the night and refusing to fight again.A portion of the
Confederate army occupied Shelbyville, Tennessee, and the larger part
entrenched at Tullahoma, eighteen miles to the southeast.Six months after the battle of Stone's River, the Federal army suddenly
awoke from its somnolent condition--a winter and spring spent in raids and
unimportant skirmishes--and became very busy preparing for a long and
hasty march.Rosecrans' plan of campaign was brilliant and proved most
effective.He realized that Tullahoma was the barrier to Chattanooga, and
determined to drive the Confederates from it.On June 23, 1863, the advance began.The cavalry, under General Stanley,
had received orders to advance upon Shelbyville on the 24th, and during
that night to build immense and numerous camp-fires before the Confederate
stronghold at Shelbyville, to create the impression that Rosecrans' entire
army was massing at that point.But the wily leader of the Federals had
other plans, and when Stanley, supported by General Granger, had built his
fires, the larger force was closing in upon Tullahoma.The stratagem dawned upon Bragg too late to check Rosecrans' plans.Stanley and Granger made a brilliant capture of Shelbyville, and Bragg
retired to Tullahoma; but finding here that every disposition had been
made to fall upon his rear, he continued his southward retreat toward
Chattanooga.[Illustration: MEN WHO LEARNED WAR WITH SHERMAN

the Federal fighting force.The men of Sherman, like their leader, were
forging steadily to the front.They had become proficient in the fighting

postpone a maneuver for months, or might terminate a campaign suddenly in

behind it.Again advancing, each had to pause for the weary work of
repair.[Illustration: SKIRMISHERS AT CHANCELLORSVILLE._Painted by J. W. Gies._

FREDERICKSBURG--DISASTER FOR A NEW UNION LEADER

    The Army of the Potomac had fought gallantly; it had not lost a single
    cannon, all its attacks being made by masses of infantry; it had
    experienced neither disorder nor rout.But the defeat was complete,
    and its effects were felt throughout the entire country as keenly as
    in the ranks of the army.The little confidence that Burnside had been
    able to inspire in his soldiers had vanished, and the respect which
    everybody entertained for the noble character of the unfortunate
    general could not supply its place.--_Comte de Paris, in "History of
    the Civil War in America."_


The silent city of military graves at Fredericksburg is a memorial of one
of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War.The battle of Antietam had been
regarded a victory by the Federals and a source of hope to the North,
after a wearisome period of inaction and defeats.General George B.
McClellan, in command of the Army of the Potomac, failed to follow up this
advantage and strike fast and hard while the Southern army was shattered
and weak.President Lincoln's impatience was brought to a climax;
McClellan was relieved and succeeded by General Ambrose E. Burnside, who
was looked upon with favor by the President, and who had twice declined
this proffered honor.It was on November 5, 1862, nearly two months after
Antietam, when this order was issued.The Army of the Potomac was in
splendid form and had made plans for a vigorous campaign.On the 9th
Burnside assumed command, and on the following day McClellan took leave of
his beloved troops.Burnside at once changed the whole plan of campaign, and decided to move
on Fredericksburg, which lay between the Union and Confederate armies.He
organized his army into three grand divisions, under Generals Sumner,
Hooker, and Franklin, commanding the right, center, and left, and moved
his troops from Warrenton to Falmouth.A delay of some two weeks was due
to the failure of arrival of the pontoons.In a council of war held on the
night of December 10th the officers under Burnside expressed themselves
almost unanimously as opposed to the plan of battle, but Burnside
disregarded their views and determined to carry out his original plans
immediately.After some delay and desultory fighting for two days, the
crossing of the army was effected by the morning of December 13th.By this
time General Robert E. Lee, commanding the Confederates, had his army
concentrated and entrenched on the hills surrounding the town.In their
efforts to place their bridges the Federals were seriously hindered by the
firing of the Confederate sharpshooters--"hornets that were stinging the
Army of the Potomac into a frenzy."The Confederate fire continued until
silenced by a heavy bombardment of the city from the Federal guns, when
the crossing of the army into Fredericksburg was completed without further
interference.The forces of Lee were in battle array about the town.Their line
stretched for five miles along the range of hills which spread in crescent
shape around the lowland where the city lay, surrounding it on all sides
save the east, where the river flowed.The strongest Confederate position
was on the <DW72>s of the lowest hill of the range, Marye's Heights, which
rose in the rear of the town.Along the foot of this hill there was a
stone wall, about four feet in height, bounding the eastern side of the
Telegraph road, which at this point runs north and south, being depressed
a few feet below the surface of the stone wall, thus forming a breastwork
for the Confederate troops.Behind it a strong force was concealed, while
higher up, in several ranks, the main army was massed, stretching along
the line of hills.The right wing, consisting of thirty thousand troops on
an elevation near Hamilton's Crossing of the Fredericksburg and Potomac
Railroad, was commanded by "Stonewall" Jackson.The left, on Marye's
Heights and Marye's Hill, was commanded by the redoubtable Longstreet.The
Southern forces numbered about seventy-eight thousand.Into the little city below and the adjoining valleys, the Federal troops
had been marching for two days.Franklin's Left Grand Division of forty
thousand was strengthened by two divisions from Hooker's Center Grand
Division, and was ordered to make the first attack on the Confederate
right under Jackson.Sumner's Right Grand Division, also reenforced from
Hooker's forces, was formed for assault against the Confederate's
strongest point at Marye's Hill.All this magnificent and portentous battle formation had been effected
under cover of a dense fog, and when it lifted on that fateful Saturday
there was revealed a scene of truly military grandeur.Concealed by the
somber curtain of nature the Southern hosts had fixed their batteries and
entrenched themselves most advantageously upon the hills, and the Union
legions, massed in menacing strength below, now lay within easy
cannon-shot of their foe.The Union army totaled one hundred and thirteen
thousand men.After skirmishing and gathering of strength, it was at
length ready for the final spring and the death-grapple.When the sun's rays broke through the fog during the forenoon of December
13th, Franklin's Grand Division was revealed in full strength in front of
the Confederate right, marching and countermarching in preparation for the
coming conflict.Officers in new, bright uniforms, thousands of bayonets
gleaming in the sunshine, champing steeds, rattling gun-carriages whisking
artillery into proper range of the foe, infantry, cavalry, batteries, with
officers and men, formed a scene of magnificent grandeur which excited the
admiration even of the Confederates.This maneuver has been called the
grandest military scene of the war.Yet with all this brave show, we have seen that Burnside's subordinate
officers were unanimous in their belief in the rashness of the
undertaking.The English military writer,
Colonel Henderson, has explained why this was so:

    And yet that vast array, so formidable of aspect, lacked that moral
    force without which physical power, even in its most terrible form, is
    but an idle show.Not only were the strength of the Confederate
    position, the want of energy of preliminary movements, the insecurity
    of their own situation, but too apparent to the intelligence of the
    regimental officers and men, but they mistrusted their commander.Northern writers have recorded that the Army of the Potomac never went
    down to battle with less alacrity than on this day at Fredericksburg.The first advance began at 8:30 in the morning, while the fog was still
dense, upon Jackson's right.Reynolds ordered Meade with a division,
supported by two other divisions under Doubleday and Gibbon, to attack
Jackson at his weakest point, the extreme right of the Confederate lines,
and endeavor to seize one of the opposing heights.The advance was made in
three lines of battle, which were guarded in front and on each flank by
artillery which swept the field in front as the army advanced.The
Confederates were placed to have an enfilading sweep from both flanks
along the entire front line of march.When Reynolds' divisions had
approached within range, Jackson's small arms on the left poured in a
deadly fire, mowing down the brave men in the Union lines in swaths,
leaving broad gaps where men had stood.This fire was repeated again and again, as the Federals pressed on, only
to be repulsed.Once only was the Confederate line broken, when Meade
carried the crest, capturing flags and prisoners.The ground lost by the
Confederates was soon recovered, and the Federals were forced to retire.Some of the charges made by the Federals during this engagement were
heroic in the extreme, only equaled by the opposition met from the foe.In one advance, knapsacks were unslung and bayonets fixed; a brigade
marched across a plowed field, and passed through broken lines of other
brigades, which were retiring to the rear in confusion from the leaden
storm.The fire became incessant and destructive; many fell, killed or wounded;
the front line slackened its pace, and without orders commenced firing.A
halt seemed imminent, and a halt in the face of the terrific fire to which
the men were exposed meant death; but, urged on by regimental commanders
in person, the charge was renewed, when with a shout they leaped the
ditches, charged across the railroad, and upon the foe, killing many with
the bayonet and capturing several hundred prisoners.But this was only a
temporary gain.In every instance the Federals were shattered and driven
back.Men were lying dead in heaps, the wounded and dying were groaning in
agony.Soldiers were fleeing; officers were galloping to and fro urging
their lines forward, and begging their superior officers for assistance
and reenforcement.A dispatch to Burnside from Franklin, dated 2:45, was as follows: "My left
has been very badly handled; what hope is there of getting reenforcements
across the river?"Another dispatch, dated 3:45, read: "Our troops have
gained no ground in the last half hour."In their retreat the fire was almost as destructive as during the assault.Most of the wounded were brought from the field after this engagement, but
the dead were left where they fell.It was during this engagement that
General George D. Bayard was mortally wounded by a shot which had severed
the sword belt of Captain Gibson, leaving him uninjured.The knapsack of a
soldier who was in a stooping posture was struck by a ball, and a deck of
cards was sent flying twenty feet in the air.Those witnessing the
ludicrous scene called to him, "Oh, deal me a hand!"thus indicating the
spirit of levity among soldiers even amid such surroundings.Another
soldier sitting on the ground suddenly leaped high above the heads of his
comrades as a shell struck the spot, scooping a wheelbarrowful of earth,
but the man was untouched.Entirely independent of the action in which the Left Grand Division under
Franklin was engaged against the right wing of the Confederate line,
Sumner's Right Grand Division was engaged in a terrific assault upon the
works on Marye's Heights, the stronghold of the Confederate forces.Their
position was almost impregnable, consisting of earthworks, wood, and stone
barricades running along the sunken road near the foot of Marye's Hill.The Federals were not aware of the sunken road, nor of the force of
twenty-five hundred under General Cobb concealed behind the stone wall,
this wall not being new work as a part of the entrenchments, but of
earlier construction.When the advance up the road was made they were
harassed by shot and shell and rifle-balls at every step, but the men came
dashing into line undismayed by the terrific fire which poured down upon
them.The Irish Brigade, the second of Hancock's division, under General
Meagher, made a wonderful charge.When they returned from the assault but
two hundred and fifty out of twelve hundred men reported under arms from
the field, and all these were needed to care for their wounded comrades.The One Hundred and Sixteenth Pennsylvania regiment was new on the field
of battle, but did fearless and heroic service.The approach was
completely commanded by the Confederate guns.Repeatedly the advance was
repulsed by well-directed fire from the batteries.Once again Sumner's gallant men charged across a railroad cut, running
down one side and up the other, and still again attempted to escape in the
same manner, but each time they were forced to retire precipitately by a
murderous fire from the Confederate batteries.Not only was the
Confederate fire disastrous upon the approach and the successive repulses
by the foe, but it also inflicted great damage upon the masses of the
Federal army in front of Marye's Hill.The Confederates' effective and
successful work on Marye's Hill in this battle was not alone due to the
natural strength of their position, but also to the skill and generalship
of the leaders, and to the gallantry, courage, and well-directed aim of
their cannoneers and infantry.Six times the heroic Union troops dashed against the invulnerable
position, each time to be repulsed with terrific loss.General Couch, who
had command of the Second Corps, viewing the scene of battle from the
steeple of the court-house with General Howard, says: "The whole plain was
covered with men, prostrate and dropping, the live men running here and
there, and in front closing upon each other, and the wounded coming back.I had never before seen fighting like that, nothing approaching it in
terrible uproar and destruction."General Howard reports that Couch exclaimed: "Oh, great God!see how our
men, our poor fellows, are falling!"At half-past one Couch signaled
Burnside: "I am losing.The point and method of attack made by Sumner was anticipated by the
Confederates, careful preparation having been made to meet it.The fire
from the Confederate batteries harassed the Union lines, and as they
advanced steadily, heroically, without hurrah or battle-cry, the ranks
were cut to pieces by canister and shell and musket-balls.Heavy artillery
fire was poured into the Union ranks from front, right, and left with
frightful results.Quickly filling up the decimated ranks they approached
the stone wall masking the death-trap where General Cobb lay with a strong
force awaiting the approach.Torrents of lead poured into the bodies of
the defenseless men, slaying, crushing, destroying the proud army of a few
hours before.As though in pity, a cloud of smoke momentarily shut out the
wretched scene but brought no balm to the helpless victims of this awful
carnage.The ground was so thickly strewn with dead bodies as seriously to
impede the movements of a renewed attack.These repeated assaults in such
good order caused some apprehension on the part of General Lee, who said
to Longstreet after the third attack, "General, they are massing very
heavily and will break your line, I am afraid."But the great general's
fears proved groundless.General Cobb was borne from the field mortally wounded, and Kershaw took
his place in the desperate struggle.The storm of shot and shell which met
the assaults was terrific.Men fell almost in battalions; the dead and
wounded lay in heaps.Late in the day the dead bodies, which had become
frozen from the extreme cold, were stood up in front of the soldiers as a
protection against the awful fire to shield the living, and at night were
set up as dummy sentinels.The steadiness of the Union troops, and the silent, determined heroism of
the rank and file in these repeated, but hopeless, assaults upon the
Confederate works, were marvelous, and amazed even their officers.The
real greatness in a battle is the fearless courage, the brave and heroic
conduct, of the men under withering fire.It was the enlisted men who were
the glory of the army.It was they, the rank and file, who stood in the
front, closed the gaps, and were mowed down in swaths like grass by cannon
and musket-balls.After the sixth disastrous attempt to carry the works of the Confederate
left it was night; the Federal army was repulsed and had retired; hope was
abandoned, and it was seen that the day was lost to the Union side.Then
the shattered Army of the Potomac sought to gather the stragglers and care
for the wounded.Fredericksburg, the beautiful Virginia town, was a
pitiable scene in contrast to its appearance a few days before.Ancestral
homes were turned into barracks and hospitals.The charming drives and
stately groves, the wonted pleasure grounds of Colonial dames and Southern
cavaliers, were not filled with grand carriages and gay parties, but with
war horses, soldiers, and military accouterments.Aside from desultory
firing by squads and skirmishers at intervals there was no renewal of the
conflict.The bloody carnage was over, the plan of Burnside had ended in failure,
and thousands of patriotic and brave men, blindly obedient to their
country's command, were the toll exacted from the Union army.Burnside,
wild with anguish at what he had done, walking the floor of his tent,
exclaimed, "Oh, those men--those men over there," pointing to the
battlefield, "I am thinking of them all the time."In his report of the
battle to Washington, Burnside gave reasons for the issue, and in a manly
way took the responsibility upon himself, and most highly commended his
officers and men.He said, "For the failure in the attack I am
responsible, as the extreme gallantry, courage, and endurance shown by
them [officers and men] were never excelled."President Lincoln's verdict in regard to this battle is adverse to the
almost unanimous opinion of the historians.In his reply, December 22d, to
General Burnside's report of the battle, he says, "Although you were not
successful, the attempt was not an error, nor the failure other than an
accident."Burnside, at his own request, was relieved of the command of
the Army of the Potomac, however, on January 25, 1863, and was succeeded
by General Hooker.The Union loss in killed, wounded, and missing was
12,653, and the Confederates lost 5,377.After the battle the wounded lay on the field in their agony exposed to
the freezing cold for forty-eight hours before arrangements were effected
to care for them.Many were burned to death by the long, dead grass
becoming ignited by cannon fire.The scene witnessed by the army of those
screaming, agonizing, dying comrades was dreadful and heart-rending.Burnside's plan had been to renew the battle, but the overwhelming opinion
of the other officers prevailed.The order was withdrawn and the defeated
Union army slipped away under the cover of darkness on December 15th, and
encamped in safety across the river.The battle of Fredericksburg had
passed into history.[Illustration: THE SECOND LEADER AGAINST RICHMOND

COPYRIGHT 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Major-General Ambrose Everett Burnside was a West Point graduate, inventor
of a breech-loading rifle, commander of a brigade in the first battle of
Bull Run, captor of Roanoke Island and Newberne (North Carolina), and
commander of the Federal left at Antietam.He was appointed to the command
of the Army of the Potomac and succeeded General George B. McClellan on
November 8, 1862.He was a brave soldier, but was an impatient leader and
inclined to be somewhat reckless.He pressed rapidly his advance against
Lee and massed his entire army along Stafford Heights, on the east bank of
the Rappahannock, opposite Fredericksburg.According to General W. B.
Franklin (who commanded the left grand division of the army), the notion
that a serious battle was necessary to Federal control of the town "was
not entertained by any one."General Sumner (who led the advance of
Burnside's army) held this opinion but he had not received orders to cross
the river.Crossing was delayed nearly a month and this delay resulted in
the Federal disaster on December 13th.This put an abrupt end to active
operations by Burnside against Lee.This picture was taken at Warrenton,
November 24th, on the eve of the departure of the army for its march to
Fredericksburg.[Illustration: THE DETAINED GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In the foreground, looking from what is
approximately the same position as the opening picture, are three guns of
Tyler's Connecticut battery.It was from all along this ridge that the
town had suffered its bombardment in December of the previous year.Again
the armies were separated by the Rappahannock River.There was a new
commander at the head of the Army of the Potomac--General Hooker.The
plundered and deserted town now held by the Confederates was to be made
the objective of another attack.The heights beyond were once more to be
assaulted; bridges were to be rebuilt.This ground
of much contention was deserted some time before Lee advanced to his
invasion of Pennsylvania.Very slowly the inhabitants of Fredericksburg
had returned to their ruined homes.The town was a vast Federal cemetery,
the dead being buried in gardens and backyards, for during its occupancy
almost every dwelling had been turned into a temporary hospital.After the
close of the war these bodies were gathered and a National Cemetery was
established on Willis' Hill, on Marye's Heights, the point successfully
defended by Lee's veterans.Heavy pontoon-boats, each on its separate wagon, were sometimes as
necessary as food or ammunition.At every important crossing of the many
rivers that had to be passed in the Peninsula Campaign the bridges had
been destroyed.There were few places where these streams were fordable.Pontoons, therefore, made a most important adjunct to the Army of the
Potomac.[Illustration: PONTOON-BOATS IN TRANSIT]


[Illustration: THE FLAMING HEIGHTS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This photograph from the Fredericksburg river-bank recalls a terrible
scene.On those memorable days of December 11 and 12, 1862, from these
very trenches shown in the foreground, the ragged gray riflemen saw on
that hillside across the river the blue of the uniforms of the massed
Federal troops.The lines of tents made great white spaces, but the ground
could hardly be seen for the host of men who were waiting, alas!to die by
thousands on this coveted shore.From these hills, too, burst an incessant
flaming and roaring cannon fire.Siege-guns and field artillery poured
shot and shell into the town of Fredericksburg.Every house became a
target, though deserted except for a few hardy and venturesome riflemen.Ruined and battered and
bloody, Fredericksburg three times was a Federal hospital, and its
backyards became little cemeteries.[Illustration: A TARGET AT FREDERICKSBURG FOR THE FEDERAL GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE BRIDGES THAT A BAND OF MUSIC THREATENED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]At Franklin Crossing, on the Rappahannock, occurred an incident that
proves how little things may change the whole trend of the best-laid
plans.The left Union wing under the command of General Franklin, composed
of the First Army Corps under General Reynolds, and the Sixth under
General W. F. Smith, was crossing to engage in the battle of
Fredericksburg.For two days they poured across these yielding planks
between the swaying boats to the farther shore.Now, in the crossing of
bridges, moving bodies of men must break step or even well-built
structures might be threatened.The colonel of one of the regiments in
General Devens' division that led the van ordered his field music to
strike up just as the head of the column swept on to the flimsy planking;
before the regiment was half-way across, unconsciously the men had fallen
into step and the whole fabric was swaying to the cadenced feet.Vibrating
like a great fiddle-string, the bridge would have sunk and parted, but a
keen eye had seen the danger.was the order, and a
staff officer spurred his horse through the men, shouting at top voice.The lone charge was made through the marching column: some jumped into the
pontoons to avoid the hoofs; a few went overboard; but the head of the
column was reached at last, and the music stopped.A greater blunder than
this, however, took place on the plains beyond.Owing to a
misunderstanding of orders, 37,000 troops were never brought into action;
17,000 men on their front bore the brunt of a long day's fighting.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE FAMOUS "IRISH BRIGADE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]"The Irish Brigade" (consisting of the Twenty-eighth Massachusetts,
Sixty-third, Sixty-ninth and Eighty-eighth New York and the One Hundred
and Sixteenth Pennsylvania) was commanded by General Thomas F. Meagher and
advanced in Hancock's Division to the first assault at Marye's Heights, on
December 13, 1862.In this charge the Irish soldiers moved steadily up the
ridge until within a few yards of a sunken road, from which unexpected
fire mowed them down.Of the 1,315 men which Meagher led into battle, 545
fell in that charge.The officer standing is Colonel Patrick Kelly, of the
Eighty-eighth New York, who was one of the valiant heroes of this charge,
and succeeded to the command of the Irish Brigade after General Meagher.The officer seated is Captain Clooney, of the
same regiment, who was killed at Antietam.Sitting next to him is Father
Dillon, Chaplain of the Sixty-third New York, and to the right Father
Corby, Chaplain of the Eighty-eighth New York; the latter gave absolution
to Caldwell's Division, of Hancock's Corps, under a very heavy fire at
Gettysburg.By the side of Colonel Kelly stands a visiting priest.The
identification of this group has been furnished by Captain W. L. D.
O'Grady, of the Eighty-eighth New York.[Illustration: THE SUMMIT OF SLAUGHTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Marye's House marked the center of the Confederate position on the
Heights, before which the Federals fell three deep in one of the bravest
and bloodiest assaults of the war.The eastern boundary of the Marye
estate was a retaining wall, along which ran a sunken road; on the other
side of this was a stone wall, shoulder high, forming a perfect infantry
parapet.Here two brigades of Confederates were posted and on the crest
above them were the supporting batteries, while the <DW72> between was
honeycombed with the rifle-pits of the sharpshooters, one of which is seen
in the picture.Six times did the Federals, raked by the deadly fire of
the Washington Artillery, advance to within a hundred yards of the sunken
road, only to be driven back by the rapid volleys of the Confederate
infantry concealed there.Less than three of every five men in Hancock's
division came back from their charge on these death-dealing heights.The
complete repulse of the day and the terrific slaughter were the barren
results of an heroic effort to obey orders.[Illustration: THE FATEFUL CROSSING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.From this, the Lacy House, which Sumner had made his headquarters, he
directed the advance of his right grand division of the Army of the
Potomac on December 11, 1862.Little did he dream that his men of the
Second Corps were to bear the brunt of the fighting and the most crushing
blow of the defeat on the 13th.Soon after three o'clock on the morning of
the 11th the columns moved out with alacrity to the river bank and before
daybreak, hidden at first by the fog, the pontoniers began building the
bridges.Confederate sharpshooters drove off the working party from the
bridge below the Lacy House and also from the middle bridge farther down.As the mist cleared, volunteers ferried themselves over in the boats and
drove off the riflemen.At last, at daybreak of the 12th, the town of
Fredericksburg was occupied, but the whole of another foggy day was
consumed in getting the army concentrated on the western shore.Nineteen
batteries (one hundred and four guns) accompanied Sumner's troops, but all
save seven of these were ordered back or left in the streets of
Fredericksburg.Late on the morning of the 13th the confused and belated
orders began to arrive from Burnside's headquarters across the river; one
was for Sumner to assault the Confederate batteries on Marye's Heights.At
nightfall Sumner's men retired into Fredericksburg, leaving 4,800 dead or
wounded on the field."Oh, those men, those men over there!I cannot get
them out of my mind!"wailed Burnside in an agony of failure.Yet he was
planning almost in the same breath to lead in person his old command, the
Ninth Corps, in another futile charge in the morning.On the night of the
14th, better judgment prevailed and the order came to retire across the
Rappahannock.[Illustration: NEW LEADERS AND NEW PLANS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.These were the men whose work it was,
during the winter after Fredericksburg, to restore the _esprit de corps_
of the Army of the Potomac.The tireless energy and magnetic personality
of Hooker soon won officers from their disaffection and put an end to
desertions--which had been going on at the rate of two hundred per day
before he took command.By spring everything seemed propitious for an
aggressive campaign, the plans for which were brilliantly drawn and at
first vigorously carried out, giving truth to Lincoln's expressed belief
that Hooker was "a trained and skilful soldier."In that remarkable letter
of admonition to Hooker upon assuming command, Lincoln added: "But beware
of rashness, beware of rashness; with energy and with sleepless vigilance
go forward and give us victories."By some strange fate it was not
rashness but quite the contrary which compassed the failure of "Fighting
Joe" Hooker at Chancellorsville.His first forward advance was executed
with his usual bold initiative.Before Lee could fully divine his purpose,
Hooker with thirty-six thousand men was across his left flank in a
favorable position, with the main body of his army at hand ready to give
battle.Then came Hooker's inexplicable order to fall back upon
Chancellorsville.That very night, consulting in the abandoned Federal
position, Lee and Jackson formed the plan which drove Hooker back across
the Rappahannock in ignominious defeat.CHANCELLORSVILLE AND JACKSON'S FLANKING MARCH


After the Fredericksburg campaign the Union forces encamped at Falmouth
for the winter, while Lee remained with the Southern army on the site of
his successful contest at Fredericksburg.Thus the two armies lay facing
each other within hailing distance, across the historic river, waiting for
the coming of spring.Major-General Joseph Hooker, popularly known as
"Fighting Joe" Hooker, who had succeeded Burnside in command of the Army
of the Potomac, soon had the troops on a splendid campaign footing.His
force was between 125,000 and 130,000 men; Lee's, about 60,000.Hooker conceived a plan of campaign which was ingenious and masterful, and
had he carried it out there would have been a different story to tell
about Chancellorsville.The plan was to deploy a portion of the army to
serve as a decoy to Lee, while the remainder of the host at the same time
occupied the vicinity of Chancellorsville, a country mansion, in the
center of the wilderness that stretched along the Rappahannock.Lee was a great general and a master in strategy.He had learned of
Hooker's plan and, paying but little attention to Sedgwick east of
Fredericksburg, had turned to face Hooker.By a rapid night march he met
the Union army before it had reached its destination.He was pushed back,
however, by Sykes, of Meade's corps, who occupied the position assigned to
him.Meade was on the left, and Slocum on the right, with adequate support
in the rear.All was in readiness and most favorable for the "certain
destruction" of the Confederates predicted by "Fighting Joe" when, to the
amazement and consternation of all his officers, Hooker ordered the whole
army to retire to the position it had occupied the day before, leaving the
advantage to his opponents.Lee quickly moved his army into the position thus relinquished, and began
feeling the Federal lines with skirmishers and some cannonading during the
evening of May 1st.By the next morning the two armies were in line of
battle.The danger in which the Confederate army now found itself was extreme.One
large Federal army was on its front, while another was at its rear, below
Fredericksburg.But Lee threw the hopes of success into one great and
decisive blow at Hooker's host.Dividing an army in the face of the foe is
extremely dangerous and contrary to all accepted theories of military
strategy; but there comes a time when such a course proves the salvation
of the legions in peril.Such was the case at Chancellorsville on May 2,
1863.the cannonading began its death-song and was soon followed by
infantry demonstrations, but without serious results.Early in the afternoon, Hooker by a ruse was beguiled into the
belief that Lee's army was in full retreat.What Hooker had seen and
believed to be a retreat was the marching of Jackson's forces, about
twenty-six thousand strong, from the battlefield.What he did not see,
however, was that, after a few miles, Jackson turned abruptly and made for
the right flank of the Federal host, the Eleventh Corps, under Howard.It
was after half-past five when Jackson broke from the woods into which he
had marched in a paralyzing charge upon the unprepared troops of Howard.The approach of this Confederate force was first intimated to the Federals
by the bending of shrubbery, the stampede of rabbits and squirrels, and
the flocks of birds in wild flight, as before a storm.Then appeared a few
skirmishers, then a musket volley, and then the storm broke in all its
fury--the war scream, the rattling musketry, the incessant roar of cannon.The knowledge that "Old Jack" was on
the field was inspiration enough for them.The charge was so precipitous,
so unexpected and terrific that it was impossible for the Federals to hold
their lines and stand against the impact of that awful onslaught which
carried everything before it.The regiments in Jackson's path, resisting
his advance, were cut to pieces and swept along as by a tidal wave, rolled
up like a scroll, multitudes of men, horses, mules, and cattle being piled
in an inextricable mass.Characteristic of Jackson's brilliant and
unexpected movements, it was like an electric flash, knocking the Eleventh
Corps into impotence, as Jackson expected it would.This crowning and
final stroke of Jackson's military genius was not impromptu, but the
result of his own carefully worked-out plan, which had been approved by
Lee.General Hooker was spending the late afternoon hours in his headquarters
at the Chancellor house.To the eastward there was considerable firing,
where his men were carrying out the plan of striking Lee in flank.Jackson
was retreating, of that he was sure, and Sickles, with Pleasanton's
cavalry and other reenforcements, was in pursuit.About half-past six the sounds of battle grew suddenly louder
and seemed to come from another direction.A staff-officer went to the
front of the house and turned his field-glass toward the west.At the startled cry Hooker sprang upon his horse and dashed down the road.He encountered portions of the Eleventh Corps pouring out of the forest--a
badly mixed crowd of men, wagons, and ambulances.They brought the news
that the right wing was overwhelmed.Hurriedly Hooker sought his old
command, Berry's division of the Third Corps, stationed in support of the
Eleventh.An officer who witnessed the scene says the division advanced with a firm
and steady step, cleaving the multitude of disbanded Federals as the bow
of a vessel cleaves the waves of the sea.It struck the advance of the
Confederates obliquely and checked it, with the aid of the Twelfth Corps
artillery.A dramatic, though tragic, feature of the rout was the charge of the
Eighth Pennsylvania cavalry, under Major Keenan, in the face of almost
certain death, to save the artillery of the Third Corps from capture.The
guns rested upon low ground and within reach of the Confederates.The
Federals had an equal opportunity to seize the artillery, but required a
few minutes to prepare themselves for action.The Confederate advance must
be checked for these few moments, and for this purpose Keenan gallantly
led his five hundred cavalrymen into the woods, while his comrades brought
the guns to bear upon the columns in gray.He gained the necessary time,
but lost his life at the head of his regiment, together with Captain
Arrowsmith and Adjutant Haddock, who fell by his side.The light of day had faded from the gruesome scene.The mighty turmoil was
silenced as darkness gathered, but the day's carnage was not ended.No
camp-fires were lighted in the woods or on the plain.The two hostile
forces were concealed in the darkness, watching through the shadows,
waiting for--they knew not what.Finally at midnight the order "Forward"
was repeated in subdued tones along the lines of Sickles' corps.Out over
the open and into the deep, dark thicket the men in blue pursued their
stealthy advance upon the Confederate position.Then the tragedies of the
night were like that of the day, and the moon shed her peaceful rays down
upon those shadowy figures as they struggled forward through the woods, in
the ravines, over the hillocks.The Federals, at heavy loss, gained the
position, and the engagement assumed the importance of a victory.It was on this day that death robbed the South of one of her most beloved
warriors.After darkness had overspread the land, Jackson, accompanied by
members of his staff, undertook a reconnaissance of the Federal lines.He came upon a line of Union infantry lying
on its arms and was forced to turn back along the plank road, on both
sides of which he had stationed his own men with orders to fire upon any
body of men approaching from the direction of the Federal battle-lines.The little cavalcade of Confederate officers galloped along the highway,
directly toward the ambuscade, and apparently forgetful of the strict
orders left with the skirmishers.A sudden flash of flame lighted the
scene for an instant, and within that space of time the Confederacy was
deprived of one of its greatest captains.Jackson was severely wounded,
and by his own men and through his own orders.When the news spread
through Jackson's corps and through the Confederate army the grief of the
Southern soldiers was heartbreaking to witness.The sorrow spread even
into the ranks of the Federal army, which, while opposed to the wounded
general on many hard-fought battle-grounds, had learned to respect and
admire "Stonewall" Jackson.The loss of Jackson to the South was incalculable.Lee had pronounced him
the right arm of the whole army.Next to Lee, Jackson was considered the
ablest general in the Confederate army.His shrewdness of judgment, his
skill in strategy, his lightning-like strokes, marked him as a unique and
brilliant leader.Devoutly religious, gentle and noble in character, the
nation that was not to be disunited lost a great citizen, as the
Confederate army lost a great captain, when a few days later General
Jackson died.That night orders passed from the Federal headquarters to Sedgwick, below
Fredericksburg, eleven miles away.Between him and Hooker stood the
Confederate army, flushed with its victories of the day.Immediately in
his front was Fredericksburg, with a strong guard of Southern warriors.Beyond loomed Marye's Heights, the battle-ground on which Burnside had in
the preceding winter left so many of his brave men in the vain endeavor to
drive the Confederate defenders from the crest.The courageous Sedgwick, notwithstanding the formidable obstacles that lay
on the road to Chancellorsville, responded immediately to Hooker's order.He was already on the south side of the river, but he was farther away
than Hooker supposed.Shortly after midnight he began a march that was
fraught with peril and death.Strong resistance was offered the advancing
blue columns as they came to the threshold of Fredericksburg, but they
swept on and over the defenders, and at dawn were at the base of the
heights.On the crest waved the standards of the Confederate Washington
Artillery.At the foot of the <DW72> was the stone wall before which the
Federals had fought and died but a few months before, in the battle of
Fredericksburg.Reenforcements were arriving in the Confederate trenches
constantly.The crest and <DW72>s bristled with cannon and muskets.The
pathways around the heights were barricaded.The route to the front seemed
blocked; still, the cry for help from Hooker was resounding in the ears of
Sedgwick.Gathering his troops, he attacked directly upon the stone wall and on up
the hillside, in the face of a terrific storm of artillery and musketry.The first assault failed; a flank movement met with no better success; and
the morning was nearly gone when the Confederates finally gave way at the
point of the bayonet before the irresistible onset of men in blue.The way
to Chancellorsville was open; but the cost to the Federals was appalling.Hundreds of the soldiers in blue lay wrapped in death upon the bloody
<DW72>s of Marye's Heights.It was the middle of the afternoon, and not at daybreak, as Hooker had
directed, when Sedgwick appeared in the rear of Lee's legions.A strong
force of Confederates under Early prevented his further advance toward a
juncture with Hooker's army at Chancellorsville.Since five o'clock in
the morning the battle had been raging at the latter place, and Jackson's
men, now commanded by Stuart, though being mowed down in great numbers,
vigorously pressed the attack of the day while crying out to one another
"Remember Jackson," as they thought of their wounded leader.While this engagement was at its height General Hooker, leaning against a
pillar of the Chancellor house, was felled to the ground, and for a moment
it was thought he was killed.The pillar had been shattered by a
cannon-ball.Hooker soon revived under the doctor's care and with great
force of will he mounted his horse and showed himself to his anxious
troops.He then withdrew his army to a stronger position, well guarded
with artillery.The Confederates did not attempt to assail it.The third
day's struggle at Chancellorsville was finished by noon, except in Lee's
rear, where Sedgwick fought all day, without success, to reach the main
body of Hooker's army.The Federals suffered very serious losses during
this day's contest.Even then it was believed that the advantage rested
with the larger Army of the Potomac and that the Federals had an
opportunity to win.Thirty-seven thousand Union troops, the First, and
three-quarters of the Fifth Corps, had been entirely out of the fight on
that day.Five thousand men of the Eleventh Corps, who were eager to
retrieve their misfortune, were also inactive.When night came, and the shades of darkness hid the sights of suffering on
the battlefield, the Federal army was resting in a huge curve, the left
wing on the Rappahannock and the right on the Rapidan.In this way the
fords across the rivers which led to safety were in control of the Army of
the Potomac.Lee moved his corps close to the bivouacs of the army in
blue.But, behind the Confederate battle-line, there was a new factor in
the struggle in the person of Sedgwick, with the remnants of his gallant
corps, which had numbered nearly twenty-two thousand when they started for
the front, but now were depleted by their terrific charge upon Marye's
Heights and the subsequent hard and desperate struggle with Early in the
afternoon.Lee was between two fires--Hooker in front and Sedgwick in the rear, both
of whose forces were too strong to be attacked simultaneously.Again the
daring leader of the Confederate legions did the unexpected, and divided
his army in the presence of the foe, though he was without the aid of his
great lieutenant, "Stonewall" Jackson.During the night Lee made his preparations, and when dawn appeared in the
eastern skies the movement began.Sedgwick, weak and battered by his
contact with Early on the preceding afternoon, resisted bravely, but to no
avail, and the Confederates closed in upon him on three sides, leaving the
way to Banks's Ford on the Rappahannock open to escape.Slowly the
Federals retreated and, as night descended, rested upon the river bank.After dark the return to the northern side was begun by Sedgwick's men,
and the Chancellorsville campaign was practically ended.The long, deep trenches full of Federal and Confederate dead told the
awful story of Chancellorsville.If we gaze into these trenches, which by
human impulse we are led to do, after the roar and din of the carnage is
still, the scene greeting the eye will never be forgotten.Side by side,
the heroes in torn and bloody uniforms, their only shrouds, were gently
laid.The Union loss in killed and wounded was a little over seventeen thousand,
and it cost the South thirteen thousand men to gain this victory on the
banks of the Rappahannock.The loss to both armies in officers was very
heavy.The two armies were weary and more than decimated.It appeared that both
were glad at the prospect of a cessation of hostilities.On the night of
May 5th, in a severe storm, Hooker conveyed his corps safely across the
river and settled the men again in their cantonments of the preceding
winter at Falmouth.The Confederates returned to their old encampment at
Fredericksburg.[Illustration: A MAN OF WHOM MUCH WAS EXPECTED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]A daring and experienced veteran of the Mexican
War, Hooker had risen in the Civil War from brigade commander to be the
commander of a grand division of the Army of the Potomac, and had never
been found wanting.His advancement to the head of the Army of the
Potomac, on January 26, 1863, was a tragic episode in his own career and
in that of the Federal arms.Gloom hung heavy over the North after
Fredericksburg.Upon Hooker fell the difficult task of redeeming the
unfulfilled political pledges for a speedy lifting of that gloom.It was
his fortune only to deepen it.[Illustration: "STONEWALL" JACKSON--TWO WEEKS BEFORE HIS MORTAL WOUND

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The austere, determined features of the victor of Chancellorsville, just
as they appeared two weeks before the tragic shot that cost the
Confederacy its greatest Lieutenant-General--and, in the opinion of sound
historians, its chief hope for independence.Only once had a war
photograph of Jackson been taken up to April, 1863, when, just before the
movement toward Chancellorsville, he was persuaded to enter a
photographer's tent at Hamilton's Crossing, some three miles below
Fredericksburg, and to sit for his last portrait.At a glance one can feel
the self-expression and power in this stern worshiper of the God of
Battles; one can understand the eulogy written by the British military
historian, Henderson: "The fame of 'Stonewall' Jackson is no longer the
exclusive property of Virginia and the South; it has become the birthright
of every man privileged to call himself an American."[Illustration: WHERE "STONEWALL" JACKSON FELL]

In this tangled nook Lee's right-hand man was shot through a terrible
mistake of his own soldiers.After his
brilliant flank march, the evening attack on the rear of Hooker's army had
just been driven home.About half-past eight, Jackson had ridden beyond
his lines to reconnoiter for the final advance.A single rifle-shot rang
out in the darkness.The outposts of the two armies were engaged.Jackson
turned toward his own line, where the Eighteenth North Carolina was
stationed.The regiment, keenly on the alert and startled by the group of
strange horsemen riding through the gloom, fired a volley that brought
several men and horses to the earth.Jackson was struck once in the right
hand and twice in the left arm, a little below the shoulder.His horse
dashed among the trees; but with his bleeding right hand Jackson succeeded
in seizing the reins and turning the frantic animal back into the road.Only with difficulty was the general taken to the rear so that his wounds
might be dressed.To his attendants he said, "Tell them simply that you
have a wounded Confederate officer."To one who asked if he was seriously
hurt, he replied: "Don't bother yourself about me.Win the battle first
and attend to the wounded afterward."He was taken to Guiney's Station.At
first it was hoped that he would recover, but pneumonia set in and his
strength gradually ebbed.On Sunday evening, May 10th, he uttered the
words which inspired the young poet, Sidney Lanier, to write his elegy,
beautiful in its serene resignation.[Illustration: THE STONE WALL AT FREDERICKSBURG

strongest natural positions stormed during the war.In front of this wall
the previous year, nearly 6,000 of Burnside's men had fallen, and it was
not carried.Again in the Chancellorsville campaign Sedgwick's Sixth Corps
was ordered to assault it.It was defended the second time with the same
death-dealing stubbornness but with less than a fourth of the former
numbers--9,000 Confederates against 20,000 Federals.At eleven o'clock in
the morning the line of battle, under Colonel Hiram Burnham, moved out
over the awful field of the year before, supported to right and left by
flanking columns.Up to within twenty-five yards of the wall they pressed,
when again the flame of musketry fire belched forth, laying low in six
minutes 36.5 per cent.The
assailants wavered and rallied, and then with one impulse both columns and
line of battle hurled themselves upon the wall in a fierce hand-to-hand
combat.A soldier of the Seventh Massachusetts happened to peer through a
crack in a board fence and saw that it covered the flank of the double
line of Confederates in the road.Up and over the fence poured the
Federals and drove the Confederates from the heights.[Illustration: THE WORK OF ONE SHELL

which had so long guarded the Heights, and inflicting slaughter upon the
assaulting columns.If Sedgwick had had cavalry he could have crushed the
divided forces of Early and cleared the way for a rapid advance to attack
Lee's rear.In the picture we see Confederate caisson wagons and horses

From this mansion, Hooker's headquarters during the battle of
Chancellorsville, he rode away after the injury he received there on May
3d, never to return.The general, dazed after Jackson's swoop upon the
right, was besides in deep anxiety as to Sedgwick.The latter's forty
thousand men had not yet come up.Hooker was unwilling to suffer further
loss without the certainty of his cooperation.The movement was the signal for increased artillery fire from
the Confederate batteries, marking the doom of the old Chancellor house.Its end was accompanied by some heartrending scenes.Major Bigelow thus
describes them: "Missiles pierced the walls or struck in the brickwork;
shells exploded in the upper rooms, setting the building on fire; the
chimneys were demolished and their fragments rained down upon the wounded
about the building.All this time the women and children (including some
slaves) of the Chancellor family, nineteen persons in all, were in the
cellar.The wounded were removed from in and around the building, men of
both armies nobly assisting one another in the work."[Illustration: RED MEN WHO SUFFERED IN SILENCE

Federal army.The Confederates enlisted many more in Missouri, Arkansas,
and Texas.In the Federal army the red men were used as advance
sharpshooters and rendered meritorious service.This photograph shows some

agony.During the campaign of 1864, from the Wilderness to Appomattox,
Captain Ely S. Parker, a gigantic Indian, became one of Grant's favorite
aids.Before the close of the war he had been promoted to the rank of
colonel, and it was he who drafted in a beautiful handwriting the terms of
Lee's surrender.He stood over six feet in height and was a conspicuous
figure on Grant's staff.The Southwestern Indians engaged in some of the
earliest battles under General Albert Pike, a Northerner by birth, but a
Southern sympathizer.[Illustration: THE BOMBARDMENT OF PORT HUDSON._Painted by E. Packbauer._

VICKSBURG AND PORT HUDSON

    On the banks of this, the greatest river in the world, the most
    decisive and far-reaching battle of the war was fought.Here at
    Vicksburg over one hundred thousand gallant soldiers and a powerful
    fleet of gunboats and ironclads in terrible earnestness for forty days
    and nights fought to decide whether the new Confederate States should
    be cut in twain; whether the great river should flow free to the Gulf,
    or should have its commerce hindered.We all know the result--the
    Union army under General Grant, and the Union navy under Admiral
    Porter were victorious.The Confederate army, under General Pemberton,
    numbering thirty thousand men, was captured and General Grant's army
    set free for operating in other fields.It was a staggering blow from
    which the Confederacy never rallied.--_Lieutenant-General Stephen D.
    Lee, C. S. A., at the dedication of the Massachusetts Volunteers'
    statue at the Vicksburg National Military Park, Vicksburg,
    Mississippi, November 14, 1903._


The Mississippi River, in its lower course, winds like a mighty serpent
from side to side along a vast alluvial bottom, which in places is more
than forty miles in width.On the eastern bank, these great coils here and
there sweep up to the bluffs of the highlands of Tennessee and
Mississippi.On these cliffs are situated Memphis, Port Hudson, Grand
Gulf, and Vicksburg.The most important of these from a military point of
view was Vicksburg, often called the "Gibraltar of the West."Situated two
hundred feet above the current, on a great bend of the river, its cannon
could command the waterway for miles in either direction, while the
obstacles in the way of a land approach were almost equally
insurmountable.The Union arms had captured New Orleans, in the spring of 1862, and
Memphis in June of that year; but the Confederates still held Vicksburg
and Port Hudson and the two hundred and fifty miles of river that lies
between them.The military object of the Federal armies in the West was
to gain control of the entire course of the great Mississippi that it
might "roll unvexed to the sea," to use Lincoln's terse expression, and
that the rich States of the Southwest, from which the Confederacy drew
large supplies and thousands of men for her armies, might be cut off from
the rest of the South.If Vicksburg were captured, Port Hudson must fall.The problem, therefore, was how to get control of Vicksburg.On the promotion of Halleck to the command of all the armies of the North,
with headquarters at Washington, Grant was left in superior command in the
West and the great task before him was the capture of the "Gibraltar of
the West."Vicksburg might have been occupied by the Northern armies at
any time during the first half of the year 1862, but in June of that year
General Bragg sent Van Dorn with a force of fifteen thousand to occupy and
fortify the heights.Van Dorn was a man of prodigious energy.In a short
time he had hundreds of men at work planting batteries, digging rifle-pits
above the water front and in the rear of the town, mounting heavy guns and
building bomb-proof magazines in tiers along the hillsides.All through
the summer, the work progressed under the direction of Engineer S. H.
Lockett, and by the coming of winter the city was a veritable Gibraltar.From the uncompleted batteries on the Vicksburg bluffs, the citizens and
the garrison soldiers viewed the advance division of Farragut's fleet,
under Commander Lee, in the river, on May 18, 1862.Fifteen hundred
infantry were on board, under command of General Thomas Williams, and with
them was a battery of artillery.Williams reconnoitered the works, and
finding them too strong for his small force he returned to occupy Baton
Rouge.The authorities at Washington now sent Farragut peremptory orders
to clear the Mississippi and accordingly about the middle of June, a
flotilla of steamers and seventeen mortar schooners, under Commander D. D.
Porter, departed from New Orleans and steamed up the river.Simultaneously Farragut headed a fleet of three war vessels and seven
gunboats, carrying one hundred and six guns, toward Vicksburg from Baton
Rouge.Many transports accompanied the ships from Baton Rouge, on which
there were three thousand of Williams' troops.The last days of June witnessed the arrival of the combined naval forces
of Farragut and Porter below the Confederate stronghold.Williams
immediately disembarked his men on the Louisiana shore, opposite
Vicksburg, and they were burdened with implements required in digging
trenches and building levees.The mighty Mississippi, at this point and in those days, swept in a
majestic bend and formed a peninsula of the western, or Louisiana shore.Vicksburg was situated on the eastern, or Mississippi shore, below the top
of the bend.Its batteries of cannon commanded the river approach for
miles in either direction.Federal engineers quickly recognized the
strategic position of the citadel on the bluff; and also as quickly saw a
method by which the passage up and down the river could be made
comparatively safe for their vessels, and at the same time place Vicksburg
"high and dry" by cutting a channel for the Mississippi through the neck
of land that now held it in its sinuous course.While Farragut stormed the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg, Williams
began the tremendous task of diverting the mighty current across the
peninsula.Farragut's bombardment by his entire fleet failed to silence
Vicksburg's cannon-guards, although the defenders likewise failed to stop
the progress of the fleet.The Federal naval commander then determined to
dash past the fortifications, trusting to the speed of his vessels and the
stoutness of their armor to survive the tremendous cannonade that would
fall upon his flotilla.Early in the morning of June 28th the thrilling
race against death began, and after two hours of terrific bombardment
aided by the mortar boats stationed on both banks, Farragut's fleet with
the exception of three vessels passed through the raging inferno to the
waters above Vicksburg, with a loss of fifteen killed and thirty wounded.On the 1st of July Flag-Officer Davis with his river gunboats arrived from
Memphis and joined Farragut.Williams and his men, including one thousand <DW64>s, labored like Titans
to complete their canal, but a sudden rise of the river swept away the
barriers with a terrific roar, and the days of herculean labor went for
naught.Again Williams' attempt to subdue the stronghold was abandoned,
and he returned with his men when Farragut did, on July 24th, to Baton
Rouge to meet death there on August 5th when General Breckinridge made a
desperate but unsuccessful attempt to drive the Union forces from the
Louisiana capital.Farragut urged upon General Halleck the importance of occupying the city
on the bluff with a portion of his army; but that general gave no heed;
and while even then it was too late to secure the prize without a contest,
it would have been easy in comparison to that which it required a year
later.In the mean time, the river steamers took an important part in the
preliminary operations against the city.Davis remained at Memphis with
his fleet for about three weeks after the occupation of that city on the
6th of June, meanwhile sending four gunboats and a transport up the White
River, with the Forty-sixth Indiana regiment, under Colonel Fitch.The
object of the expedition, undertaken at Halleck's command, was to destroy
Confederate batteries and to open communication with General Curtis, who
was approaching from the west.It failed in the latter purpose but did
some effective work with the Southern batteries along the way.The one extraordinary incident of the expedition was the disabling of the
_Mound City_, one of the ironclad gunboats, and the great loss of life
that it occasioned.Charles the troops under Fitch were
landed, and the _Mound City_ moving up the river, was fired on by
concealed batteries under the direction of Lieutenant Dunnington.A
32-pound shot struck the vessel, crashed through the side and passed
through the steam-drum.Many of
the men were so quickly enveloped in the scalding vapor that they had no
chance to escape.Others leaped overboard, some being drowned and some
rescued through the efforts of the _Conestoga_ which was lying near.While
straining every nerve to save their lives, the men had to endure a shower
of bullets from Confederate sharpshooters on the river banks.Of the one
hundred and seventy-five officers and men of the _Mound City_ only
twenty-five escaped death or injury in that fearful catastrophe.Meanwhile, Colonel Fitch with his land forces rushed upon the Confederate
batteries and captured them.The unfortunate vessel was at length repaired
and returned to service.For some time it had been known in Federal military and naval circles that
a powerful ironclad similar to the famous _Monitor_ of Eastern waters was
being rushed to completion up the Yazoo.The new vessel was the
_Arkansas_.On July 15th, she steamed through the Union fleet, bravely
exchanging broadsides, and lodged safely under the guns of Vicksburg.That
evening the Federal boats in turn ran past the doughty _Arkansas_, but
failed to destroy her.The month of July had not been favorable to the Federal hopes.Farragut
had returned to New Orleans.General Williams had gone with him as far as
Baton Rouge.Davis now went with his fleet back to Helena.Halleck was
succeeded by Grant.Vicksburg entered upon a period of quiet.The city's experience of blood and fire
had only begun.During the summer and autumn of 1862, the one thought
uppermost in the mind of General Grant was how to gain possession of the
stronghold.He was already becoming known for his bull-dog tenacity.In
the autumn, two important changes took place, but one day apart.On
October 14th, General John C. Pemberton succeeded Van Dorn in command of
the defenses of Vicksburg, and on the next day David D. Porter succeeded
Davis as commander of the Federal fleet on the upper Mississippi.So arduous was the task of taking Vicksburg that the wits of General
Grant, and those of his chief adviser, General W. T. Sherman, were put to
the test in the last degree to accomplish the end.Grant knew that the
capture of this fortified city was of great importance to the Federal
cause, and that it would ever be looked upon as one of the chief acts in
the drama of the Civil War.The first plan attempted was to divide the army, Sherman taking part of it
from Memphis and down the Mississippi on transports, while Grant should
move southward along the line of the Mississippi Central Railroad to
cooperate with Sherman, his movements to be governed by the efforts of the
scattered Confederate forces in Mississippi to block him.But the whole
plan was destined to failure, through the energies of General Van Dorn and
others of the Confederate army near Grant's line of communication.The authorities at Washington preferred the river move upon Vicksburg, as
the navy could keep the line of communication open.The stronghold now
stood within a strong line of defense extending from Haynes' Bluff on the
Yazoo to Grand Gulf on the Mississippi, thirty miles below Vicksburg.To
prepare for Sherman's attack across the swamps of the Yazoo, Admiral
Porter made several expeditions up that tortuous stream to silence
batteries and remove torpedoes.In one of these he lost one of the Eads
ironclads, the _Cairo_, blown up by a torpedo, and in another the brave
Commander Gwin, one of the heroes of Shiloh, was mortally wounded.Sherman, with an army of thirty-two thousand men, left Memphis on December
20th, and landed a few days later some miles north of Vicksburg on the
banks of the Yazoo.On the 29th he made a daring attack in three columns
on the Confederate lines of defense at Chickasaw Bayou and suffered a
decisive repulse.His loss was nearly two thousand men; the Confederate
loss was scarcely two hundred.Two hundred feet above the bayou, beyond where the Federals were
approaching, towered the Chickasaw Bluffs, to which Pemberton hastened
troops from Vicksburg as soon as he learned Sherman's object.At the base
of the bluff, and stretching away to the north and west were swamps and
forests intersected by deep sloughs, overhung with dense tangles of vines
and cane-brakes.Federal valor vied with Confederate pluck in this fight
among the marshes and fever-infested jungle-land.One of Sherman's storming parties, under General G. W. Morgan, came upon a
broad and deep enlargement of the bayou, McNutt Lake, which interposed
between it and the Confederates in the rifle-pits on the <DW72>s and crest
of the bluff.In the darkness of the night of December 28th, the Federal
pontoniers labored to construct a passage-way across the lake.When
morning dawned the weary pontoniers were chagrined to discover their
well-built structure spanning a slough leading in another direction than
toward the base of the bluff.The bridge was quickly taken up, and the
Federals recommenced their labors, this time in daylight and within sight
and range of the Southern regiments on the hill.The men in blue worked
desperately to complete the span before driven away by the foe's cannon;
but the fire increased with every minute, and the Federals finally
withdrew.Another storming party attempted to assail the Confederates from across a
sandbar of the bayou, but was halted at the sight and prospect of
overcoming a fifteen-foot bank on the farther side.The crumbling bank was
surmounted with a levee three feet high; the steep sides of the barrier
had crumbled away, leaving an overhanging shelf, two feet wide.Two
companies of the Sixth Missouri regiment volunteered to cross the two
hundred yards of exposed passage, and to cut a roadway through the rotten
bank to allow their comrades a free path to the bluff beyond.To add to
the peril of the crossing, the sandbar was strewn with tangles of
undergrowth and fallen trees, and the Confederate shells and bullets were
raining upon the ground.Still, the gallant troops began their dash.From
the very start, a line of wounded and dead Missourians marked the passage
of the volunteers.The survivors reached the bank and desperately sought
to dig the roadway.From the shrubbery on the bank suddenly appeared
Confederate sharpshooters who poured their fire into the laboring
soldiers; the flame of the discharging muskets burned the clothing of the
Federals because the hostile forces were so close.Human endurance could
not stand before this carnage, and the brave Missourians fled from the
inferno.Sherman now found the northern pathway to Vicksburg impassable,
and withdrew his men to the broad Mississippi.Earlier in the same month had occurred two other events which, with the
defeat of Chickasaw, go to make up the triple disaster to the Federals.On
the 11th, General Nathan Forrest, one of the most brilliant cavalry
leaders on either side, began one of those destructive raids which
characterize the Civil War.With twenty-five hundred horsemen, Forrest
dashed unopposed through the country north of Grant's army, tore up sixty
miles of railroad and destroyed all telegraph lines.Meantime, on December 20th, the day on which Sherman left Memphis, General
Van Dorn pounced upon Holly Springs, in Mississippi, like an eagle on its
prey, capturing the guard of fifteen hundred men and burning the great
store of supplies, worth $1,500,000, which Grant had left there.Through
the raids of Forrest and Van Dorn, Grant was left without supplies and for
eleven days without communication with the outside world.He marched
northward to Grand Junction, in Tennessee, a distance of eighty miles,
living off the country.It was not until January 8, 1863, that he heard,
through Washington, of the defeat of Sherman in his assault on Chickasaw
Bluffs.Grant and Sherman had no thought of abandoning Vicksburg because of this
failure.But a month of unfortunate military dissension over rank in the
command of Sherman's army resulted in General John A. McClernand, armed
with authority from Washington, coming down from Illinois and superseding
Sherman.On January 11, 1864, he captured Arkansas Post, a stronghold on
the Arkansas River.But Grant, having authority to supersede McClernand in
the general proceedings against Vicksburg, did so, on January 30th, and
arguments on military precedence were forgotten.Grant was determined to lead his Army of the Tennessee below Vicksburg and
approach the city from the south, without breaking with his base of
supplies up the river.Two projects, both of which were destined to fail,
were under way during the winter and spring months of 1863.One of these
was to open a way for the river craft through Lake Providence, west of the
Mississippi, through various bayous and rivers into the Red River, a
detour of four hundred miles.Another plan was to cut a channel through the peninsula of the great bend
of the Mississippi, opposite Vicksburg.For six weeks, thousands of men
worked like marmots digging this ditch; but, meantime, the river was
rising and, on March 8th, it broke over the embankment and the men had to
run for their lives.Many horses were drowned and a great number of
implements submerged.The "Father of Waters" had put a decisive veto on
the project and it had to be given up.Still another plan that failed was
to cut through the Yazoo Pass and approach from the north by way of the
Coldwater, the Tallahatchie, and the Yazoo rivers.He _would_ take
Vicksburg.It was to transfer
his army by land down the west bank of the Mississippi to a point below
the city and approach it from the south and west.This necessitated the
running of the batteries by Porter's fleet--an extremely perilous
enterprise.The army was divided into four corps, commanded respectively
by Sherman, McClernand, McPherson, and Hurlbut.On March 29th, the movement of McClernand from Milliken's Bend
to a point opposite Grand Gulf was begun.He was soon followed by
McPherson and a few weeks later by Sherman.It required a month for the
army, with its heavy artillery, to journey through the swamps and bogs of
Louisiana.While this march was in progress, something far more exciting was taking
place on the river.Porter ran the batteries of Vicksburg with his fleet.After days of preparation the fleet of vessels, protected by cotton bales
and hay about the vital parts of the boats, with heavy logs slung near the
water-line--seven gunboats, the ram _General Price_, three transports, and
various barges were ready for the dangerous journey on the night of April
16th.Silently in the darkness, they left their station near the mouth of
the Yazoo, at a quarter past nine.For an hour and a half all was silence
and expectancy.The bluffs on the east loomed black against the night sky.Suddenly, the flash of musketry fire pierced the darkness.In a few minutes every battery overlooking the river was a center of
spurting flame.A storm of shot and shell was rained upon the passing
vessels.The water of the river
was lashed into foam by the shots and shell from the batteries.The air was filled with flying
missiles.Several houses on the Louisiana shore burst into flame and the
whole river from shore to shore was lighted with vivid distinctness.A
little later, a giant flame leaped from the bosom of the river.It burned to the
water's edge, nearly all its crew escaping to other vessels.Grant
described the scene as "magnificent, but terrible"; Sherman pronounced it
"truly sublime."By three in the morning, the fleet was below the city and ready to
cooperate with the army.One vessel had been destroyed, several others
were crippled; thirteen men had been wounded, but Grant had the assistance
he needed.About a week later, six more transports performed the same feat
and ran the batteries; each had two barges laden with forage and rations
in tow.Grant's next move was to transfer the army across the river and to secure
a base of supplies.There, on the bluff, was Grand Gulf, a tempting spot.But the Confederate guns showed menacingly over the brow of the hill.After a fruitless bombardment by the fleet on April 29th, it was decided
that a more practical place to cross the river must be sought below.Meanwhile, Sherman was ordered by his chief to advance upon the formidable
Haynes' Bluff, on the Yazoo River, some miles above the scene of his
repulse in the preceding December.The message had said, "Make a
demonstration on Haynes' Bluff, and make all the _show_ possible."Sherman's transports, and three of Porter's gunboats, were closely
followed by the Confederate soldiers who had been stationed at the series
of defenses on the range of hills, and when they arrived at Snyder's Mill,
just below Haynes' Bluff, on April 30th, General Hebert and several
Louisiana regiments were awaiting them.On that day and the next the
Confederates fiercely engaged the Union fleet and troops, and on May 2d
Sherman withdrew his forces to the western bank of the Mississippi and
hastened to Grant.The Confederates
had been prevented from sending reenforcements to Grand Gulf, and Grant's
crossing was greatly facilitated.The fleet passed the batteries of Grand Gulf and stopped at Bruinsburg,
six miles below.A landing was soon made, the army taken across on April
30th, and a march to Port Gibson, twelve miles inland, was begun.General
Bowen, Confederate commander at Grand Gulf, came out and offered battle.He was greatly outnumbered, but his troops fought gallantly throughout
most of the day, May 1st, before yielding the field.Port Gibson was then
occupied by the Union army, and Grand Gulf, no longer tenable, was
abandoned by the Confederates.Grant now prepared for a campaign into the interior of Mississippi.His
first intention was to cooperate with General Banks in the capture of Port
Hudson, after which they would move together upon Vicksburg.But hearing
that Banks would not arrive for ten days, Grant decided that he would
proceed to the task before him without delay.His army at that time
numbered about forty-three thousand.That under Pemberton probably forty
thousand, while there were fifteen thousand Confederate troops at Jackson,
Mississippi, soon to be commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, who was
hastening to that capital.The Federal leader now determined on the bold plan of making a dash into
the interior of Mississippi, beating Johnston and turning on Pemberton
before their forces could be joined.This campaign is pronounced the most
brilliant in the Civil War.It was truly Napoleonic in conception and
execution.Grant knew that his base of supplies at Grand Gulf would be cut
off by Pemberton as soon as he moved away from it.He decided, therefore,
against the advice of his generals, to abandon his base altogether.With a few days'
rations in their haversacks the troops were to make a dash that would
possibly take several weeks into the heart of a hostile country.When General Halleck heard of Grant's daring
scheme he wired the latter from Washington, ordering him to move his army
down the river and cooperate with Banks.Fortunately, this order was
received too late to interfere with Grant's plans.As soon as Sherman's divisions joined the main army the march was begun,
on May 7th.An advance of this character must be made with the greatest
celerity and Grant's army showed amazing speed.McPherson, who commanded
the right wing, proceeded toward Jackson by way of Raymond and at the
latter place encountered five thousand Confederates, on May 12th, who
blocked his way and were prepared for fight.McPherson was completely successful and the Confederates
hastened to join their comrades in Jackson.He moved on toward Jackson, and as the last of his
command left Raymond the advance of Sherman's corps reached it.That
night, May 13th, Grant ordered McPherson and Sherman to march upon Jackson
next morning by different roads, while McClernand was held in the rear
near enough to reenforce either in case of need.The rain fell in torrents
that night and, as Grant reported, in places the water was a foot deep in
the road.At eleven o'clock
in the morning of the 14th, a concerted attack was made on the capital of
Mississippi.A few hours' brisk fighting concluded this act of the drama,
and the Stars and Stripes were unfurled on the State capitol.Among the
spoils were seventeen heavy guns.That night, Grant slept in the house
which Johnston had occupied the night before.Meantime, Johnston had ordered Pemberton to detain Grant by attacking him
in the rear.But Pemberton considered it more advisable to move toward
Grand Gulf to separate Grant from his base of supplies, not knowing that
Grant had abandoned his base.And now, with Johnston's army scattered,
Grant left Sherman to burn bridges and military factories, and to tear up
the railroads about Jackson while he turned fiercely on Pemberton.McPherson's corps took the lead.Grant called on McClernand to follow
without delay.Then, hearing that Pemberton was marching toward him, he
called on Sherman to hasten from Jackson.At Champion's Hill (Baker's
Creek) Pemberton stood in the way, with eighteen thousand men.The battle was soon in progress--the heaviest of the campaign.It
continued for seven or eight hours.The Confederates were defeated with a
loss of nearly all their artillery and about half their force, including
four thousand men who were cut off from the main army and failed to rejoin
it.On the banks of the Big Black River, a few miles westward, the
Confederates made another stand, and here the fifth battle of the
investment of Vicksburg took place.The
Confederates suffered heavy losses and the remainder hastened to the
defenses of Vicksburg.They had set fire to the bridge across the Big
Black, and Grant's army was detained for a day--until the Confederates
were safely lodged in the city.The Federal army now invested Vicksburg, occupying the surrounding hills.It was May 18th when the remarkable campaign to reach Vicksburg came to an
end.In eighteen days, the army had marched one hundred and eighty miles
through a hostile country, fought and won five battles, captured a State
capital, had taken twenty-seven heavy cannon and sixty field-pieces, and
had slain or wounded six thousand men and captured as many more.As Grant
and Sherman rode out on the hill north of the city, the latter broke into
enthusiastic admiration of his chief, declaring that up to that moment he
had felt no assurance of success, and pronouncing the campaign one of the
greatest in history.The great problem of investing Vicksburg was solved at last.Around the
doomed city gleamed the thousands of bayonets of the Union army.The
inhabitants and the army that had fled to it as a city of refuge were
penned in.But the Confederacy was not to yield without a stubborn
resistance.On May 19th, an advance was made on the works and the
besieging lines drew nearer and tightened their coils.Three days later,
on May 22nd, Grant ordered a grand assault by his whole army.The troops,
flushed with their victories of the past three weeks, were eager for the
attack.All the corps commanders set their watches by Grant's in order to
begin the assault at all points at the same moment--ten o'clock in the
morning.At the appointed time, the cannon from the encircling lines burst
forth in a deafening roar.Then came the answering thunders from the
mortar-boats on the Louisiana shore and from the gunboats anchored beneath
the bluff.The gunboats' fire was answered from within the bastions
protecting the city.The opening of the heavy guns on the land side was
followed by the sharper crackle of musketry--thousands of shots,
indistinguishable in a continuous roll.The men in the Federal lines leaped from their hiding places and ran to
the parapets in the face of a murderous fire from the defenders of the
city, only to be mowed down by hundreds.Others came, crawling over the
bodies of their fallen comrades--now and then they planted their colors on
the battlements of the besieged city, to be cut down by the galling
Confederate fire.Thus it continued hour after hour, until the coming of
darkness.The Union loss was about three thousand
brave men; the Confederate loss was probably not much over five hundred.Grant had made a fearful sacrifice; he was paying a high price but he had
a reason for so doing--Johnston with a reenforcing army was threatening
him in the rear; by taking Vicksburg at this time he could have turned on
Johnston, and could have saved the Government sending any more Federal
troops; and, to use his own words, it was needed because the men "would
not have worked in the trenches with the same zeal, believing it
unnecessary, as they did after their failure, to carry the enemy's works."On the north side of the city overlooking the river, were the powerful
batteries on Fort Hill, a deadly menace to the Federal troops, and Grant
and Sherman believed that if enfiladed by the gunboats this position could
be carried.At their request Admiral Porter sent the _Cincinnati_ on May
27th to engage the Confederate guns, while four vessels below the town did
the same to the lower defenses.In half an hour five of the
_Cincinnati's_ guns were disabled; and she was in a sinking condition.She
was run toward the shore and sank in three fathoms of water.The army now settled down to a wearisome siege.For six weeks, they
encircled the city with trenches, approaching nearer and nearer to the
defending walls; they exploded mines; they shot at every head that
appeared above the parapets.One by one the defending batteries were
silenced.The sappers slowly worked their way toward the Confederate
ramparts.Miners were busy on both sides burrowing beneath the
fortifications.At three o'clock on the afternoon of June 25th a redoubt
in the Confederate works was blown into the air, breaking into millions of
fragments and disclosing guns, men, and timber.With the mine explosion,
the Federal soldiers before the redoubt began to dash into the opening,
only to meet with a withering fire from an interior parapet which the
Confederates had constructed in anticipation of this event.The carnage
was appalling to behold; and when the soldiers of the Union finally
retired they had learned a costly lesson which withheld them from attack
when another mine was exploded on July 1st.Meantime, let us take a view of the river below and the life of the people
within the doomed city.Far down the river, two hundred and fifty miles
from Vicksburg, was Port Hudson.The place was fortified and held by a
Confederate force under General Gardner.Like Vicksburg, it was besieged
by a Federal army, under Nathaniel P. Banks, of Cedar Mountain fame.On
May 27th, he made a desperate attack on the works and was powerfully aided
by Farragut with his fleet in the river.But aside from dismounting a few
guns and weakening the foe at a still heavier cost to their own ranks, the
Federals were unsuccessful.Again, on June 10th, and still again on the
14th, Banks made fruitless attempts to carry Port Hudson by storm.He
then, like Grant at Vicksburg, settled down to a siege.The defenders of
Port Hudson proved their courage by enduring every hardship.At Vicksburg, during the whole six weeks of the siege, the men in the
trenches worked steadily, advancing the coils about the city.Grant
received reenforcement and before the end of the siege his army numbered
over seventy thousand.Day and night, the roar of artillery continued.From the mortars across the river and from Porter's fleet the shrieking
shells rose in grand parabolic curves, bursting in midair or in the
streets of the city, spreading havoc in all directions.The people of the
city burrowed into the ground for safety.Many whole families lived in
these dismal abodes, their walls of clay being shaken by the roaring
battles that raged above the ground.In one of these dens, sixty-five
people found a home.The food supply ran low, and day by day it became
scarcer.At last, by the end of June, there was nothing to eat except mule
meat and a kind of bread made of beans and corn meal.It was ten o'clock in the morning of July 3d.White flags were seen above
the parapet.A strange quietness rested over the scene
of the long bombardment.On the afternoon of that day, the one, too, on
which was heard the last shot on the battlefield of Gettysburg, Grant and
Pemberton stood beneath an oak tree, in front of McPherson's corps, and
opened negotiations for the capitulation.On the following morning, the
Nation's birthday, about thirty thousand soldiers laid down their arms as
prisoners of war and were released on parole.The losses from May 1st to
the surrender were about ten thousand on each side.Three days later, at Port Hudson, a tremendous cheer arose from the
besieging army.The Confederates within the defenses were at a loss to
know the cause.Then some one shouted the news, "Vicksburg has
surrendered!"Port Hudson could not hope to stand alone; the greater
fortress had fallen.Two days later, July 9th, the gallant garrison, worn
and weary with the long siege, surrendered to General Banks.The whole
course of the mighty Mississippi was now under the Stars and Stripes.[Illustration: BEFORE VICKSBURG]

The close-set mouth, squared shoulders and lowering brow in this
photograph of Grant, taken in December, 1862, tell the story of the
intensity of his purpose while he was advancing upon Vicksburg--only to be
foiled by Van Dorn's raid on his line of communications at Holly Springs.His grim expression and determined jaw betokened no respite for the
Confederates, however.Six months later he marched into the coveted
stronghold.This photograph was taken by James Mullen at Oxford,
Mississippi, in December, 1862, just before Van Dorn's raid balked the
general's plans.[Illustration: AFTER VICKSBURG]

This photograph was taken in the fall of 1863, after the capture of the
Confederacy's Gibraltar had raised Grant to secure and everlasting fame.His attitude is relaxed and his eyebrows no longer mark a straight line
across the grim visage.The right brow is slightly arched with an almost
jovial expression.But the jaw is no less vigorous and determined, and the
steadfast eyes seem to be peering into that future which holds more
victories.He still has Chattanooga and his great campaigns in the East to
fight and the final magnificent struggle in the trenches at Petersburg.[Illustration: WHERE GRANT'S CAMPAIGN WAS HALTED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The second attempt to capture
Vicksburg originated with Grant.Since he had sprung into fame at Fort
Donelson early in 1862, he had done little to strengthen his reputation;
but to all urgings of his removal Lincoln replied: "I can't spare this
man; he fights."He proposed to push southward through Mississippi to
seize Jackson, the capital.If this could be accomplished, Vicksburg
(fifty miles to the west) would become untenable.At Washington his plan
was overruled to the extent of dividing his forces.Sherman, with a
separate expedition, was to move from Memphis down the Mississippi
directly against Vicksburg.It was Grant's hope that by marching on he
could unite with Sherman in an assault upon this key to the Mississippi.Pushing forward from Grand Junction, sixty miles, Grant reached Oxford
December 5, 1862, but his supplies were still drawn from Columbus,
Kentucky, over a single-track road to Holly Springs, and thence by wagon
over roads which were rapidly becoming impassable.Delay ensued in which
Van Dorn destroyed Federal stores at Holly Springs worth $1,500,000.This
put an end to Grant's advance.In the picture we see an Illinois regiment
guarding some of the 1200 Confederate prisoners taken during the advance
and here confined in the Courthouse.[Illustration: WHERE VICKSBURG'S FATE WAS SEALED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here on May 16, 1863, Grant crowned
his daring maneuver against Vicksburg from the south with complete
success.Once across the river below Grand Gulf, after an easy victory at
Port Gibson, he was joined by Sherman.The army struck out across the
strange country south of the Big Black River and soon had driven
Pemberton's southern outposts across that stream.Grant was now on solid
ground; he had successfully turned the flank of the Confederates and he
grasped the opportunity to strike a telling blow.Pressing forward to
Raymond and Jackson, he captured both, and swept westward to meet the
astounded Pemberton, still vacillating between attempting a junction with
Johnston or attacking Grant in the rear.But Grant, moving with wonderful
precision, prevented either movement.On May 16th a battle ensued which
was most decisive around Champion's Hill.Pemberton was routed and put to
flight, and on the next day the Federals seized the crossings of the Big
Black River.Spiking their guns at Haynes' Bluff, the Confederates retired
into Vicksburg, never to come out again except as prisoners.In eighteen
days from the time he crossed the Mississippi, Grant had gained the
advantage for which the Federals had striven for more than a year at
Vicksburg.[Illustration: THE BRIDGE THE CONFEDERATES BURNED AT BIG BLACK RIVER

men fled with precipitate haste over the dreary swamp to the river and
crossed over and burned the railroad and other bridges just in time to
prevent McClernand from following.The necessary delay was aggravating to
Grant's forces.The rest of the day and night was consumed in building
bridges.Sherman had the only pontoon-train with the army and his bridge
was the first ready at Bridgeport, early in the evening.[Illustration: Vicksburg, taken under fire.COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]THE GATE TO THE MISSISSIPPI

The handwriting is that of Surgeon Bixby, of the Union hospital ship "Red
Rover."In his album he pasted this unique photograph from the western
shore of the river where the Federal guns and mortars threw a thousand
shells into Vicksburg during the siege.The prominent building is the
courthouse, the chief landmark during the investment.Here at Vicksburg
the Confederates were making their last brave stand for the possession of
the Mississippi River, that great artery of traffic.If it were wrested
from them the main source of their supplies would be cut off.Pemberton, a
brave and capable officer and a Pennsylvanian by birth, worked
unremittingly for the cause he had espoused.Warned by the early attacks
of General Williams and Admiral Farragut, he had left no stone unturned to
render Vicksburg strongly defended.It had proved impregnable to attack on
the north and east, and the powerful batteries planted on the river-front
could not be silenced by the fleet nor by the guns of the Federals on the
opposite shore.But Grant's masterful maneuver of cutting loose from his
base and advancing from the south had at last out-generaled both Pemberton
and Johnston.Nevertheless, Pemberton stoutly held his defenses.His high
river-battery is photographed below, as it frowned upon the Federals
opposite.[Illustration]


[Illustration: THE WELL-DEFENDED CITADEL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Behind these fortifications Pemberton, driven from the Big Black River,
gathered his twenty-one thousand troops to make the last stand for the
saving of the Mississippi to the Confederacy.In the upper picture we see
Fort Castle, one of the strongest defenses of the Confederacy.It had full
sweep of the river; here "Whistling Dick" (one of the most powerful guns
in possession of the South) did deadly work.In the lower picture we see
the fortifications to the east of the town, before which Grant's army was
now entrenching.When Vicksburg had first been threatened in 1862, the
Confederate fortifications had been laid out and work begun on them in
haste with but five hundred spades, many of the soldiers delving with
their bayonets.The sites were so well chosen and the work so well done
that they had withstood attacks for a year.They were to hold out still
longer.By May 18th the Federals had completely invested Vicksburg, and
Grant and Sherman rode out to Haynes' Bluff to view the open river to the
north, down which abundant supplies were now coming for the army.Sherman,
who had not believed that the plan could succeed, frankly acknowledged his
mistake.Sherman, assaulting the
fortifications of Vicksburg, the next day, was repulsed.A second attack,
on the 22d, failed and on the 25th Grant settled down to starve Pemberton
out.[Illustration]


[Illustration: THE WORK OF THE BESIEGERS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Battery Sherman, on the Jackson Road, before Vicksburg.Settling down to a
siege did not mean idleness for Grant's army.Fortifications had to be
opposed to the formidable one of the Confederates and a constant
bombardment kept up to silence their guns, one by one.It was to be a
drawn-out duel in which Pemberton, hoping for the long-delayed relief from
Johnston, held out bravely against starvation and even mutiny.For twelve
miles the Federal lines stretched around Vicksburg, investing it to the
river bank, north and south.More than eighty-nine battery positions were
constructed by the Federals.Battery Sherman was exceptionally well
built--not merely revetted with rails or cotton-bales and floored with
rough timber, as lack of proper material often made necessary.Gradually
the lines were drawn closer and closer as the Federals moved up their guns
to silence the works that they had failed to take in May.At the time of
the surrender Grant had more than 220 guns in position, mostly of heavy
caliber.By the 1st of July besieged and besiegers faced each other at a
distance of half-pistol shot.Starving and ravaged by disease, the
Confederates had repelled repeated attacks which depleted their forces,
while Grant, reenforced to three times their number, was showered with
supplies and ammunition that he might bring about the long-delayed victory
which the North had been eagerly awaiting since Chancellorsville.[Illustration: INVESTING BY INCHES

of Vicksburg.The position was immediately in front of this honeycombed
<DW72> on the Jackson road.Upon these troops fell most of the labor of
sapping and mining, which finally resulted in the wrecking of the fort so
gallantly defended by the veterans of the Third Louisiana.As the Federal
lines crept up, the men working night and day were forced to live in
burrows.They became proficient in such gopher work as the picture shows.Up to the "White House" (Shirley's) the troops could be marched in
comparative safety, but a short distance beyond they were exposed to the
Confederate sharpshooters, who had only rifles and muskets to depend on;
their artillery had long since been silenced.Near this house was
constructed "Coonskin's" Tower; it was built of railway iron and
cross-ties under the direction of Second Lieutenant Henry C. Foster, of
Company B, Twenty-third Indiana.A backwoodsman and dead-shot, he was
particularly active in paying the Confederate sharpshooters in their own
coin.He habitually wore a cap of raccoon fur, which gave him his nickname
and christened the tower, from which the interior of the Confederate works
could be seen.[Illustration: THE FIRST MONUMENT AT THE MEETING PLACE]

Independence Day, 1863, was a memorable anniversary of the nation's birth;
it brought to the anxious North the momentous news that Meade had won at
Gettysburg and that Vicksburg had fallen in the West.The marble shaft in
the picture was erected to mark the spot where Grant and Pemberton met on
July 3d to confer about the surrender.Under a tree, within a few hundred
feet of the Confederate lines, Grant greeted his adversary as an old
acquaintance.They had fought in the same division for a time in the
Mexican War.Each spoke but two sentences as to the surrender, for Grant
lived up to the nickname he gained at Donelson, and Pemberton's pride was
hurt.The former comrades walked and talked awhile on other things, and
then returned to their lines.Next day the final terms were arranged by
correspondence, and the Confederates marched out with colors flying; they
stacked their arms and, laying their colors upon them, marched back into
the city to be paroled.Those who signed the papers not to fight until
exchanged numbered 29,391.The tree where the commanders met was soon
carried away, root and branch, by relic-hunters.Subsequently the monument
which replaced it was chipped gradually into bits, and in 1866 a
64-pounder cannon took its place as a permanent memorial.[Illustration: VICKSBURG IN POSSESSION OF THE FEDERALS

In the picture the "Silver Lake" is lying off Vicksburg after its fall.While Admiral Porter was busy attacking Vicksburg with the Mississippi
squadron, Lieutenant-Commander Le Roy Fitch, with a few small gunboats,
was actively patrolling the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers.It was soon
seen that the hold upon Tennessee and Kentucky gained by the Federals by
the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson would be lost without adequate
assistance from the navy, and Admiral Porter was authorized to purchase
small light-draft river steamers and add them to Fitch's flotilla as
rapidly as they could be converted into gunboats.One of the first to be
completed was the "Silver Lake."The little stern-wheel steamer first
distinguished herself on February 3, 1863, at Dover, Tennessee, where she
(with Fitch's flotilla) assisted in routing 4,500 Confederates, who were
attacking the Federals at that place.The little vessel continued to
render yeoman's service with the other gunboats, ably assisted by General
A. W. Ellet's marine brigade.[Illustration]


[Illustration: THE CONFEDERACY CUT IN TWAIN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The Levee at Vicksburg, February, 1864.For seven months the Federals had
been in possession of the city, and the Mississippi--now open through its
entire course--cut off the struggling Confederacy in the East from the
South and Southwest, the storehouses of their resources and their main
dependence in continuing the struggle.But even such a blow as this,
coming on top of Gettysburg, did not force the brave people of the South
to give up the struggle.In the picture the only remaining warlike signs
are the tents on the opposite shore.But on both sides of the river the
Confederates were still desperately striving to reunite their territory.In the East another year and more of the hardest kind of fighting was
ahead; another severing in twain of the South was inevitable before peace
could come, and before the muskets could be used to shoot the crows, and
before their horses could plough the neglected fields.WITHIN THE PARAPET AT PORT HUDSON IN THE SUMMER OF 1863

These fortifications withstood every attack of Banks' powerful army from
May 24 to July 9, 1863.Like Vicksburg, Port Hudson could be reduced only
by a weary siege.These pictures, taken within the fortifications, show in
the distance the ground over which the investing army approached to the
two unsuccessful grand assaults they made upon the Confederate defenders.A continuous line of parapet,
equally strong, had been thrown up for the defense of Port Hudson,
surrounding the town for a distance of three miles and more, each end
terminating on the riverbank.Four powerful forts were located at the
salients, and the line throughout was defended by thirty pieces of field
artillery.Brigadier-General Beall, who commanded the post in 1862,
constructed these works.Major-General Frank Gardner succeeded him in
command at the close of the year.[Illustration: THE WELL-DEFENDED WORKS]

[Illustration: CONFEDERATE FORTIFICATIONS BEFORE PORT HUDSON]

Gardner was behind these defenses with a garrison of about seven thousand
when Banks approached Port Hudson for the second time on May 24th.Gardner
was under orders to evacuate the place and join his force to that of
Johnston at Jackson, Mississippi, but the courier who brought the order
arrived at the very hour when Banks began to bottle up the Confederates.On the morning of May 25th Banks drove in the Confederate skirmishers and
outposts and, with an army of thirty thousand, invested the fortifications
from the eastward.At 10 A.M., after an artillery duel of more than four
hours, the Federals advanced to the assault of the works.Fighting in a
dense forest of magnolias, amid thick undergrowth and among ravines choked
with felled timber, the progress of the troops was too slow for a telling
attack.The battle has been described as "a gigantic bushwhack."The
Federals at the center reached the ditch in front of the Confederate works
but were driven off.It had cost
Banks nearly two thousand men.[Illustration: THE GUN THAT FOOLED THE FEDERALS]

A "Quaker gun" that was mounted by the Confederates in the fortifications
on the bluff at the river-front before Port Hudson.This gun was hewn out
of a pine log and mounted on a carriage, and a black ring was painted
around the end facing the river.Throughout the siege it was mistaken by
the Federals for a piece of real ordnance.To such devices as this the
beleaguered garrison was compelled constantly to resort in order to
impress the superior forces investing Port Hudson with the idea that the
position they sought to capture was formidably defended.Port Hudson was not again attacked from the river after the
passing of Farragut's two ships.[Illustration: WITHIN "THE CITADEL"

daylight of June 14th) that Banks had ordered all along the line in his
second effort to capture the position.The only result was simply to
advance the Federal lines from fifty to two hundred yards nearer.In front
of the "citadel" an advance position was gained from which a mine was
subsequently run to within a few yards of the fort.[Illustration: THE FIRST INDIANA NAVY ARTILLERY AT BATON ROUGE

THE FUTURE ADMIRAL AS CIVIL WAR LIEUTENANT

In the fight with the batteries at Port Hudson, March 14, 1863, Farragut,
in the "Hartford" lashed to the "Albatross," got by, but the fine old
consort of the "Hartford," the "Mississippi," went down--her gunners
fighting to the last.Farragut, in anguish, could see her enveloped in
flames lighting up the river.She had grounded under the very guns of a
battery, and not until actually driven off by the flames did her men
leave her.When the "Mississippi" grounded, the shock threw her
lieutenant-commander into the river, and in confusion he swam toward the
shore; then, turning about, he swam back to his ship.Captain Smith thus
writes in his report: "I consider that I should be neglecting a most
important duty should I omit to mention the coolness of my executive
officer, Mr.Dewey, and the steady, fearless, and gallant manner in which
the officers and men of the 'Mississippi' defended her, and the orderly
and quiet manner in which she was abandoned after being thirty-five
minutes aground under the fire of the enemy's batteries.There was no
confusion in embarking the crew, and the only noise was from the enemy's
cannon."Lieutenant-Commander George Dewey, here mentioned at the age of
26, was to exemplify in Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, the lessons he was
learning from Farragut.[Illustration]

DURING THE FAMOUS ADDRESS IN DEDICATION OF THE CEMETERY

The most important American address is brief: "Fourscore and seven years
ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in
liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.We are met on a
great battlefield of that war.We have come to dedicate a portion of that
field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that
that nation might live.It is altogether fitting and proper that we should
do this.But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
we cannot hallow this ground.The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or
detract.The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here,
but it can never forget what they did here.It is for us, the living,
rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought
here have thus far so nobly advanced.It is rather for us to be here
dedicated to the great task remaining before us;--that from these honored
dead, we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the
last full measure of devotion;--that we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have
a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the earth."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG--THE HIGH-WATER MARK OF THE CIVIL WAR


The military operations of the American Civil War were carried on for the
most part south of the Mason and Dixon line; but the greatest and most
famous of the battles was fought on the soil of the old Keystone State,
which had given birth to the Declaration of Independence and to the
Constitution of the United States.Gettysburg is a quiet hamlet, nestling among the hills of Adams County,
and in 1863 contained about fifteen hundred inhabitants.It had been
founded in 1780 by James Gettys, who probably never dreamed that his name
thus given to the village would, through apparently accidental
circumstances, become famous in history for all time.The hills immediately around Gettysburg are not rugged or precipitous;
they are little more than gentle swells of ground, and many of them were
covered with timber when the hosts of the North and the legions of the
South fought out the destiny of the American republic on those memorable
July days in 1863.Lee's army was flushed with victory after Chancellorsville and was
strengthened by the memory of Fredericksburg.Southern hopes were high
after Hooker's defeat on the Rappahannock, in May, 1863, and public
opinion was unanimous in demanding an invasion of Northern soil.On the
other hand, the Army of the Potomac, under its several leaders, had met
with continual discouragement, and, with all its patriotism and valor, its
two years' warfare showed but few bright pages to cheer the heart of the
war-broken soldier, and to inspire the hopes of the anxious public in the
North.Leaving General Stuart with ten thousand cavalry and a part of Hill's
corps to prevent Hooker from pursuing, Lee crossed the Potomac early in
June, 1863, concentrated his army at Hagerstown, Maryland, and prepared
for a campaign in Pennsylvania, with Harrisburg as the objective.His army
was organized in three corps, under the respective commands of Longstreet,
Ewell, and A. P. Hill.Lee had divided his army so as to approach
Harrisburg by different routes and to assess the towns along the way for
large sums of money.Late in June, he was startled by the intelligence
that Stuart had failed to detain Hooker, and that the Federals had crossed
the Potomac and were in hot pursuit.Lee was quick to see that his plans must be changed.He knew that to
continue his march he must keep his army together to watch his pursuing
antagonist, and that such a course in this hostile country would mean
starvation, while the willing hands of the surrounding populace would
minister to the wants of his foe.Again, if he should scatter his forces
that they might secure the necessary supplies, the parts would be attacked
singly and destroyed.Lee saw, therefore, that he must abandon his
invasion of the North or turn upon his pursuing foe and disable him in
order to continue his march.But that foe was a giant of strength and
courage, more than equal to his own; and the coming together of two such
forces in a mighty death-struggle meant that a great battle must be
fought, a greater battle than this Western world had hitherto known.The Army of the Potomac had again changed leaders, and George Gordon Meade
was now its commander.Hooker, after a dispute with Halleck, resigned his
leadership, and Meade, the strongest of the corps commanders, was
appointed in his place, succeeding him on June 28th.The two great
armies--Union and Confederate--were scattered over portions of Maryland
and southern Pennsylvania.Both were marching northward, along almost
parallel lines.The Confederates were gradually pressing toward the east,
while the Federals were marching along a line eastward of that followed by
the Confederates.The new commander of the Army of the Potomac was keeping
his forces interposed between the legions of Lee and the Federal capital,
and watching for an opportunity to force the Confederates to battle where
the Federals would have the advantage of position.It was plain that they
must soon come together in a gigantic contest; but just where the shock of
battle would take place was yet unknown.Meade had ordered a general
movement toward Harrisburg, and General Buford was sent with four thousand
cavalry to intercept the Confederate advance guard.On the night of June 30th Buford encamped on a low hill, a mile west of
Gettysburg, and here on the following morning the famous battle had its
beginning.On the morning of July 1st the two armies were still scattered, the
extremes being forty miles apart.But General Reynolds, with two corps of
the Union army, was but a few miles away, and was hastening to Gettysburg,
while Longstreet and Hill were approaching from the west.Buford opened
the battle against Heth's division of Hill's corps.Reynolds soon joined
Buford, and three hours before noon the battle was in progress on Seminary
Ridge.Reynolds rode out to his fighting-lines on the ridge, and while
placing his troops, a little after ten o'clock in the morning, he received
a sharpshooter's bullet in the brain.John F. Reynolds, who had been promoted for gallantry at Buena Vista
in the Mexican War, was one of the bravest and ablest generals of the
Union army.No casualty of the war brought more widespread mourning to the
North than the death of Reynolds.But even this calamity could not stay the fury of the battle.By one
o'clock both sides had been greatly reenforced, and the battle-line
extended north of the town from Seminary Ridge to the bank of Rock Creek.Here for hours the roar of the battle was unceasing.About the middle of
the afternoon a breeze lifted the smoke that had enveloped the whole
battle-line in darkness, and revealed the fact that the Federals were
being pressed back toward Gettysburg.General Carl Schurz, who after
Reynolds' death directed the extreme right near Rock Creek, leaving nearly
half of his men dead or wounded on the field, retreated toward Cemetery
Hill, and in passing through the town the Confederates pursued and
captured a large number of the remainder.The left wing, now unable to
hold its position owing to the retreat of the right, was also forced back,
and it, too, took refuge on Cemetery Hill, which had been selected by
General O. O. Howard; and the first day's fight was over.It was several
hours before night, and had the Southerners known of the disorganized
condition of the Union troops, they might have pursued and captured a
large part of the army.Meade, who was still some miles from the field,
hearing of the death of Reynolds, had sent Hancock to take general command
until he himself should arrive.Hancock had ridden at full speed and arrived on the field between three
and four o'clock in the afternoon.His presence soon brought order out of
chaos.His superb bearing, his air of confidence, his promise of heavy
reenforcements during the night, all tended to inspire confidence and to
renew hope in the ranks of the discouraged army.Had this day ended the
affair at Gettysburg, the usual story of the defeat of the Army of the
Potomac would have gone forth to the world.Only the advance portions of
both armies had been engaged; and yet the battle had been a formidable
one.A great commander had fallen, and the rank
and file had suffered the fearful loss of ten thousand men.Meade reached the scene late in the night, and chose to make this field,
on which the advance of both armies had accidentally met, the place of a
general engagement.Lee had come to the same decision, and both called on
their outlying legions to make all possible speed to Gettysburg.Before
morning, nearly all the troops of both armies had reached the field.The
Union army rested with its center on Cemetery Ridge, with its right thrown
around to Culp's Hill and its left extended southward toward the rocky
peak called Round Top.The Confederate army, with its center on Seminary
Ridge, its wings extending from beyond Rock Creek on the north to a point
opposite Round Top on the south, lay in a great semi-circle, half
surrounding the Army of the Potomac.First,
"Stonewall" Jackson was gone, and second, Stuart was absent with his ten
thousand cavalry.Furthermore, Meade was on the defensive, and had the
advantage of occupying the inner ring of the huge half circle.Thus lay
the two mighty hosts, awaiting the morning, and the carnage that the day
was to bring.It seemed that the fate of the Republic was here to be
decided, and the people of the North and the South watched with breathless
eagerness for the decision about to be made at Gettysburg.The dawn of July 2d betokened a beautiful summer day in southern
Pennsylvania.The hours of the night had been spent by the two armies in
marshaling of battalions and maneuvering of corps and divisions, getting
into position for the mighty combat of the coming day.But, when morning
dawned, both armies hesitated, as if unwilling to begin the task of
bloodshed.They remained inactive, except for a stray shot here and there,
until nearly four o'clock in the afternoon.The fighting on this second day was chiefly confined to the two extremes,
the centers remaining comparatively inactive.Longstreet commanded the
Confederate right, and opposite him on the Union left was General Daniel
E. Sickles.The Confederate left wing, under Ewell, was opposite Slocum
and the Union right stationed on Culp's Hill.The plan of General Meade had been to have the corps commanded by General
Sickles connect with that of Hancock and extend southward near the base of
the Round Tops.Sickles found this ground low and disadvantageous as a
fighting-place.In his front he saw the high ground along the ridge on the
side of which the peach orchard was situated, and advanced his men to this
position, placing them along the Emmitsburg road, and back toward the
Trostle farm and the wheat-field, thus forming an angle at the peach
orchard.The left flank of Hancock's line now rested far behind the right
flank of Sickles' forces.The Third Corps was alone in its position in
advance of the Federal line.The Confederate troops later marched along
Sickles' front so that Longstreet's corps overlapped the left wing of the
Union army.The Northerners grimly watched the bristling cannon and the
files of men that faced them across the valley, as they waited for the
battle to commence.The boom of cannon from Longstreet's batteries announced the beginning of
the second day's battle.Lee had ordered Longstreet to attack Sickles in
full force.The fire was quickly answered by the Union troops, and before
long the fight extended from the peach orchard through the wheatfield and
along the whole line to the base of Little Round Top.The musketry
commenced with stray volleys here and there--then more and faster, until
there was one continuous roar, and no ear could distinguish one shot from
another.Longstreet swept forward in a magnificent line of battle, a mile
and a half long.He pressed back the Union infantry, and was seriously
threatening the artillery.At the extreme left, close to the Trostle house, Captain John Bigelow
commanded the Ninth Battery, Massachusetts Light Artillery.He was ordered
to hold his position at all hazards until reenforced.With double charges
of grape and canister, again and again he tore great gaps in the advancing
line, but it re-formed and pressed onward until the men in gray reached
the muzzles of the Federal guns.Again Bigelow fired, but the heroic band
had at last to give way to the increased numbers of the attack, which
finally resulted in a hand-to-hand struggle with a Mississippi regiment.Bigelow was wounded, and twenty-eight of his hundred and four men were
left on the bloody field, while he lost sixty-five out of eighty-eight
horses, and four of six guns.Such was one of many deeds of heroism
enacted at Gettysburg.But the most desperate struggle of the day was the fight for the
possession of Little Round Top.Just before the action began General Meade
sent his chief engineer, General G. K. Warren, to examine conditions on
the Union left.The battle was raging in the peach orchard when he came to
Little Round Top.It was unoccupied at the time, and Warren quickly saw
the great importance of preventing its occupation by the Confederates, for
the hill was the key to the whole battle-ground west and south of Cemetery
Ridge.Before long, the engineer saw Hood's division of Longstreet's corps
moving steadily toward the hill, evidently determined to occupy it.Had
Hood succeeded, the result would have been most disastrous to the Union
army, for the Confederates could then have subjected the entire Union
lines on the western edge of Cemetery Ridge to an enfilading fire.Warren
and a signal officer seized flags and waved them, to deceive the
Confederates as to the occupation of the height.Sykes' corps, marching to
the support of the left, soon came along, and Warren, dashing down the
side of the hill to meet it, caused the brigade under Colonel Vincent and
a part of that under General Weed to be detached, and these occupied the
coveted position.Hazlett's battery was dragged by hand up the rugged
<DW72> and planted on the summit.Meantime Hood's forces had come up the hill, and were striving at the very
summit; and now occurred one of the most desperate hand-to-hand conflicts
of the war--in which men forgot that they were human and tore at each
other like wild beasts.The opposing forces, not having time to reload,
charged each other with bayonets--men assaulted each other with clubbed
muskets--the Blue and the Gray grappled in mortal combat and fell dead,
side by side.The privates in the front ranks fought their way onward
until they fell, the officers sprang forward, seized the muskets from the
hands of the dying and the dead, and continued the combat.The furious
struggle continued for half an hour, when Hood's forces gave way and were
pressed down the hillside.But they rallied and advanced again by way of a
ravine on the left, and finally, after a most valiant charge, were driven
back at the point of the bayonet.Little Round Top was saved to the Union army, but the cost was appalling.The hill was covered with hundreds of the slain.Scores of the Confederate
sharpshooters had taken position among the crevasses in the Devil's Den,
where they could overlook the position on Little Round Top, and their
unerring aim spread death among the Federal officers and gunners.Colonel
O'Rourke and General Vincent were dead.General Weed was dying; and, as
Hazlett was stooping to receive Weed's last message, a sharpshooter's
bullet laid him--dead--across the body of his chief.During this attack, and for some hours thereafter, the battle continued in
the valley below on a grander scale and with demon-like fury.Sickles' whole line was pressed back to the base
of the hill from which it had advanced in the morning.Sickles' leg was
shattered by a shell, necessitating amputation, while scores of his brave
officers, and thousands of his men, lay on the field of battle when the
struggle ceased at nightfall.This valley has been appropriately named the
"Valley of Death."Before the close of this main part of the second day's battle, there was
another clash of arms, fierce but of short duration, at the other extreme
of the line.Lee had ordered Ewell to attack Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill
on the north, held by Slocum, who had been weakened by the sending of a
large portion of the Twelfth Corps to the assistance of the left wing.Ewell had three divisions, two of which were commanded by Generals Early
and Johnson.It was nearly sunset when he sent Early to attack Cemetery
Hill.Early was repulsed after an hour's bloody and desperate hand-to-hand
fight, in which muskets and bayonets, rammers, clubs, and stones were
used.Johnson's attack on Culp's Hill was more successful.After a severe
struggle of two or three hours General Greene, who alone of the Twelfth
Corps remained on the right, succeeded, after reenforcement, in driving
the right of Johnson's division away from its entrenchments, but the left
had no difficulty in taking possession of the abandoned works of Geary and
Ruger, now gone to Round Top and Rock Creek to assist the left wing.Thus closed the second day's battle at Gettysburg.The harvest of death
had been frightful.The Union loss during the two days had exceeded twenty
thousand men; the Confederate loss was nearly equal.The Confederate army
had gained an apparent advantage in penetrating the Union breastworks on
Culp's Hill.But the Union lines, except on Culp's Hill, were unbroken.On
the night of July 2d, Lee and his generals held a council of war and
decided to make a grand final assault on Meade's center the following day.His counsel was that
Lee withdraw to the mountains, compel Meade to follow, and then turn and
attack him.But Lee was encouraged by the arrival of Pickett's division
and of Stuart's cavalry, and Longstreet's objections were overruled.Meade
and his corps commanders had met and made a like decision--that there
should be a fight to the death at Gettysburg.That night a brilliant July moon shed its luster upon the ghastly field on
which thousands of men lay, unable to rise.Their last battle was over, and their spirits had fled to the great
Beyond.But there were great numbers, torn and gashed with shot and shell,
who were still alive and calling for water or for the kindly touch of a
helping hand.Here and there in the
moonlight little rescuing parties were seeking out whom they might succor.They carried many to the improvised hospitals, where the surgeons worked
unceasingly and heroically, and many lives were saved.All through the night the Confederates were massing artillery along the
crest of Seminary Ridge.The sound horses were carefully fed and watered,
while those killed or disabled were replaced by others.The ammunition was
replenished and the guns were placed in favorable positions and made ready
for their work of destruction.On the other side, the Federals were diligently laboring in the moonlight,
and ere the coming of the day they had planted batteries on the brow of
the hill above the town as far as Little Round Top.The coming of the
morning revealed the two parallel lines of cannon, a mile apart, which
signified only too well the story of what the day would bring forth.The people of Gettysburg, which lay almost between the armies, were
awakened on that fateful morning--July 3, 1863--by the roar of artillery
from Culp's Hill, around the bend toward Rock Creek.This knoll in the
woods had, as we have seen, been taken by Johnson's men the night before.When Geary and Ruger returned and found their entrenchments occupied by
the Confederates they determined to recapture them in the morning, and
began firing their guns at daybreak.Seven hours of fierce bombardment and
daring charges were required to regain them.Every rod of space was
disputed at the cost of many a brave man's life.At eleven o'clock this
portion of the Twelfth Corps was again in its old position.But the most desperate onset of the three days' battle was yet to
come--Pickett's charge on Cemetery Ridge--preceded by the heaviest
cannonading ever heard on the American continent.With the exception of the contest at Culp's Hill and a cavalry fight east
of Rock Creek, the forenoon of July 3d passed with only an occasional
exchange of shots at irregular intervals.At noon there was a lull, almost
a deep silence, over the whole field.It was the ominous calm that
precedes the storm.At one o'clock signal guns were fired on Seminary
Ridge, and a few moments later there was a terrific outburst from one
hundred and fifty Confederate guns, and the whole crest of the ridge, for
two miles, was a line of flame.The scores of batteries were soon enveloped in smoke, through which the
flashes of burning powder were incessant.The long line of Federal guns withheld their fire for some minutes, when
they burst forth, answering the thunder of those on the opposite hill.An
eye-witness declares that the whole sky seemed filled with screaming
shells, whose sharp explosions, as they burst in mid-air, with the
hurtling of the fragments, formed a running accompaniment to the deep,
tremendous roar of the guns.Many of the Confederate shots went wild, passing over the Union army and
plowing up the earth on the other side of Cemetery Ridge.But others were
better aimed and burst among the Federal batteries, in one of which
twenty-seven out of thirty-six horses were killed in ten minutes.The
Confederate fire seemed to be concentrated upon one point between Cemetery
Ridge and Little Round Top, near a clump of scrub oaks.Here the batteries
were demolished and men and horses were slain by scores.The spot has been
called "Bloody Angle."The Federal fire proved equally accurate and the destruction on Seminary
Ridge was appalling.For nearly two hours the hills shook with the
tremendous cannonading, when it gradually slackened and ceased.The Union
army now prepared for the more deadly charge of infantry which it felt was
sure to follow.As the cannon smoke drifted away from between
the lines fifteen thousand of Longstreet's corps emerged in grand columns
from the wooded crest of Seminary Ridge under the command of General
Pickett on the right and General Pettigrew on the left.Longstreet had
planned the attack with a view to passing around Round Top, and gaining it
by flank and reverse attack, but Lee, when he came upon the scene a few
moments after the final orders had been given, directed the advance to be
made straight toward the Federal main position on Cemetery Ridge.The charge was one of the most daring in warfare.The distance to the
Federal lines was a mile.For half the distance the troops marched gayly,
with flying banners and glittering bayonets.Then came the burst of
Federal cannon, and the Confederate ranks were torn with exploding shells.Pettigrew's columns began to waver, but the lines re-formed and marched
on.When they came within musket-range, Hancock's infantry opened a
terrific fire, but the valiant band only quickened its pace and returned
the fire with volley after volley.Pettigrew's troops succumbed to the
storm.For now the lines in blue were fast converging.Federal troops from
all parts of the line now rushed to the aid of those in front of Pickett.The batteries which had been sending shell and solid shot changed their
ammunition, and double charges of grape and canister were hurled into the
column as it bravely pressed into the sea of flame.The Confederates came
close to the Federal lines and paused to close their ranks.Each moment
the fury of the storm from the Federal guns increased."Forward," again rang the command along the line of the Confederate front,
and the Southerners dashed on.The first line of the Federals was driven
back.A stone wall behind them gave protection to the next Federal force.Riflemen rose from behind and hurled a
death-dealing volley into the Confederate ranks.A defiant cheer answered
the volley, and the Southerners placed their battle-flags on the ramparts.General Armistead grasped the flag from the hand of a falling bearer, and
leaped upon the wall, waving it in triumph.Almost instantly he fell
among the Federal troops, mortally wounded.General Garnett, leading his
brigade, fell dead close to the Federal line.General Kemper sank,
wounded, into the arms of one of his men.Troops from all directions rushed upon
him.Clubbed muskets and barrel-staves now became weapons of warfare.The
Confederates began surrendering in masses and Pickett ordered a retreat.Yet the energy of the indomitable Confederates was not spent.Several
supporting brigades moved forward, and only succumbed when they
encountered two regiments of Stannard's Vermont brigade, and the fire of
fresh batteries.As the remnant of the gallant division returned to the works on Seminary
Ridge General Lee rode out to meet them.His
features gave no evidence of his disappointment.With hat in hand he
greeted the men sympathetically."It was all my fault," he said."Now help
me to save that which remains."The
losses of the two armies reached fifty thousand, about half on either
side.More than seven thousand men had fallen dead on the field of battle.The tide could rise no higher; from this point the ebb must begin.Not
only here, but in the West the Southern cause took a downward turn; for at
this very hour of Pickett's charge, Grant and Pemberton, a thousand miles
away, stood under an oak tree on the heights above the Mississippi and
arranged for the surrender of Vicksburg.Lee could do nothing but lead his army back to Virginia.The Federals
pursued but feebly.The Union victory was not a very decisive one, but,
supported as it was by the fall of Vicksburg, the moral effect on the
nation and on the world was great.It
required but little prophetic vision to foresee that the Republic would
survive the dreadful shock of arms.[Illustration: THE CRISIS BRINGS FORTH THE MAN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Major-General George Gordon Meade and Staff.Not men, but a man is what
counts in war, said Napoleon; and Lee had proved it true in many a bitter
lesson administered to the Army of the Potomac.At the end of June, 1863,
for the third time in ten months, that army had a new commander.Promptness and caution were equally imperative in that hour.Meade's
fitness for the post was as yet undemonstrated; he had been advanced from
the command of the Fifth Corps three days before the army was to engage in
its greatest battle.Lee must be turned back from Harrisburg and
Philadelphia and kept from striking at Baltimore and Washington, and the
somewhat scattered Army of the Potomac must be concentrated.In the very
first flush of his advancement, Meade exemplified the qualities of sound
generalship that placed his name high on the list of Federal commanders.[Illustration: ROBERT E. LEE IN 1863

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]It was with the gravest misgivings that Lee began his invasion of the
North in 1863.He was too wise a general not to realize that a crushing
defeat was possible.Yet, with Vicksburg already doomed, the effort to win
a decisive victory in the East was imperative in its importance.Magnificent was the courage and fortitude of Lee's maneuvering during that
long march which was to end in failure.Hitherto he had made every one of
his veterans count for two of their antagonists, but at Gettysburg the
odds had fallen heavily against him.Jackson, his resourceful ally, was no
more.Longstreet advised strongly against giving battle, but Lee
unwaveringly made the tragic effort which sacrificed more than a third of
his splendid army.[Illustration: HANCOCK, "THE SUPERB"

1st a foam-flecked charger dashed up Cemetery Hill bearing General
Hancock.He had galloped thirteen miles to take command.Apprised of the
loss of Reynolds, his main dependence, Meade knew that only a man of vigor
and judgment could save the situation.He chose wisely, for Hancock was
one of the best all-round soldiers that the Army of the Potomac had
developed.It was he who re-formed the shattered corps and chose the
position to be held for the decisive struggle.[Illustration: MUTE PLEADERS IN THE CAUSE OF PEACE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, BY PATRIOT PUB.There was little time that could be employed by either side in caring for
those who fell upon the fields of the almost uninterrupted fighting at
Gettysburg.On the morning of the 4th, when Lee began to abandon his
position on Seminary Ridge, opposite the Federal right, both sides sent
forth ambulance and burial details to remove the wounded and bury the dead
in the torrential rain then falling.Under cover of the hazy atmosphere,
Lee was getting his whole army in motion to retreat.Many an unfinished
shallow grave, like the one above, had to be left by the Confederates.In
this lower picture some men of the Twenty-fourth Michigan infantry are
lying dead on the field of battle.This regiment--one of the units of the
Iron Brigade--left seven distinct rows of dead as it fell back from
battle-line to battle-line, on the first day.Three-fourths of its members
were struck down.[Illustration: MEN OF THE IRON BRIGADE]


[Illustration: THE FIRST DAY'S TOLL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The lives laid down by the blue-clad soldiers in the first day's fighting
made possible the ultimate victory at Gettysburg.The stubborn resistance
of Buford's cavalry and of the First and Eleventh Corps checked the
Confederate advance for an entire day.The delay was priceless; it enabled
Meade to concentrate his army upon the heights to the south of Gettysburg,
a position which proved impregnable.To a Pennsylvanian, General John F.
Reynolds, falls the credit of the determined stand that was made that day.Commanding the advance of the army, he promptly went to Buford's support,
bringing up his infantry and artillery to hold back the Confederates.[Illustration: McPHERSON'S WOODS]

At the edge of these woods General Reynolds was killed by a Confederate
sharpshooter in the first vigorous contest of the day.The woods lay
between the two roads upon which the Confederates were advancing from the
west, and General Doubleday (in command of the First Corps) was ordered to
take the position so that the columns of the foe could be enfiladed by the
infantry, while contending with the artillery posted on both roads.The
Iron Brigade under General Meredith was ordered to hold the ground at all
hazards.As they charged, the troops shouted: "If we can't hold it, where
will you find the men who can?"On they swept, capturing General Archer
and many of his Confederate brigade that had entered the woods from the
other side.As Archer passed to the rear, Doubleday, who had been his
classmate at West Point, greeted him with "Good morning![Illustration: FEDERAL DEAD AT GETTYSBURG, JULY 1, 1863

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.All the way from McPherson's Woods back to Cemetery Hill lay the Federal
soldiers, who had contested every foot of that retreat until nightfall.The Confederates were massing so rapidly from the west and north that
there was scant time to bring off the wounded and none for attention to
the dead.There on the field lay the shoes so much needed by the
Confederates, and the grim task of gathering them began.The dead were
stripped of arms, ammunition, caps, and accoutrements as well--in fact, of
everything that would be of the slightest use in enabling Lee's poorly
equipped army to continue the internecine strife.It was one of war's
awful expedients.[Illustration: SEMINARY RIDGE, BEYOND GETTYSBURG]

Along this road the Federals retreated toward Cemetery Hill in the late
afternoon of July 1st.The success of McPherson's Woods was but temporary,
for the Confederates under Hill were coming up in overpowering numbers,
and now Ewell's forces appeared from the north.The first Corps, under
Doubleday, "broken and defeated but not dismayed," fell back, pausing now
and again to fire a volley at the pursuing Confederates.It finally joined
the Eleventh Corps, which had also been driven back to Cemetery Hill.Lee
was on the field in time to watch the retreat of the Federals, and advised
Ewell to follow them up, but Ewell (who had lost 3,000 men) decided upon
discretion.Night fell with the beaten Federals, reinforced by the Twelfth
Corps and part of the Third, facing nearly the whole of Lee's army.[Illustration: IN THE DEVIL'S DEN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Upon this wide, steep hill, about five hundred yards due west of Little
Round Top and one hundred feet lower, was a chasm named by the country
folk "the Devil's Den."When the position fell into the hands of the
Confederates at the end of the second day's fighting, it became the
stronghold of their sharpshooters, and well did it fulfill its name.It
was a most dangerous post to occupy, since the Federal batteries on the
Round Top were constantly shelling it in an effort to dislodge the hardy
riflemen, many of whom met the fate of the one in the picture.Their
deadly work continued, however, and many a gallant officer of the Federals
was picked off during the fighting on the afternoon of the second day.General Vincent was one of the first victims; General Weed fell likewise;
and as Lieutenant Hazlett bent over him to catch his last words, a bullet
through the head prostrated that officer lifeless on the body of his
chief.[Illustration: THE UNGUARDED LINK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Little Round Top, the key to the Federal left at Gettysburg, which they
all but lost on the second day--was the scene of hand-to-hand fighting
rarely equaled since long-range weapons were invented.Twice the
Confederates in fierce conflict fought their way near to this summit, but
were repulsed.Had they gained it, they could have planted artillery which
would have enfiladed the left of Meade's line, and Gettysburg might have
been turned into an overwhelming defeat.Beginning at the right, the
Federal line stretched in the form of a fish-hook, with the barb resting
on Culp's Hill, the center at the bend in the hook on Cemetery Hill, and
the left (consisting of General Sickles' Third Corps) forming the shank to
the southward as far as Round Top.On his own responsibility Sickles had
advanced a portion of his line, leaving Little Round Top unprotected.Upon
this advanced line of Sickles, at the Peach Orchard on the Emmitsburg
road, the Confederates fell in an effort to turn what they supposed to be
Meade's left flank.Only the promptness of General Warren, who discovered
the gap and remedied it in time, saved the key.[Illustration: THE HEIGHT OF THE BATTLE-TIDE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Near this gate to the local cemetery of Gettysburg there stood during the
battle this sign: "All persons found using firearms in these grounds will
be prosecuted with the utmost rigor of the law."Many a soldier must have
smiled grimly at these words, for this gateway became the key of the
Federal line, the very center of the cruelest use of firearms yet seen on
this continent.On the first day Reynolds saw the value of Cemetery Hill
in case of a retreat.Howard posted his reserves here, and Hancock greatly
strengthened the position.One hundred and fifty Confederate guns were
turned against it that last afternoon.In five minutes every man of the
Federals had been forced to cover; for an hour and a half the shells fell
fast, dealing death and laying waste the summer verdure in the little
graveyard.Up to the very guns of the Federals on Cemetery Hill, Pickett
led his devoted troops.At night of the 3d it was one vast
slaughter-field.On this eminence, where thousands were buried, was
dedicated the soldiers' National Cemetery.[Illustration: PICKETT--THE MARSHALL NEY OF GETTYSBURG]

The Now-or-never Charge of Pickett's Men.When the Confederate artillery
opened at one o'clock on the afternoon of July 3d, Meade and his staff
were driven from their headquarters on Cemetery Ridge.Nothing could live
exposed on that hillside, swept by cannon that were being worked as fast
as human hands could work them.It was the beginning of Lee's last effort
to wrest victory from the odds that were against him.Longstreet, on the
morning of the 3d, had earnestly advised against renewing the battle
against the Gettysburg heights.But Lee saw that in this moment the fate
of the South hung in the balance; that if the Army of Northern Virginia
did not win, it would never again become the aggressor.Pickett's
division, as yet not engaged, was the force Lee designated for the
assault; every man was a Virginian, forming a veritable Tenth Legion in
valor.Auxiliary divisions swelled the charging column to 15,000.In the
middle of the afternoon the Federal guns ceased firing.Twice Pickett asked of Longstreet if he should go
forward."Sir, I shall lead my division
forward," said Pickett at last, and the heavy-hearted Longstreet bowed his
head.As the splendid column swept out of the woods and across the plain
the Federal guns reopened with redoubled fury.For a mile Pickett and his
men kept on, facing a deadly greeting of round shot, canister, and the
bullets of Hancock's resolute infantry.It was magnificent--but every one
of Pickett's brigade commanders went down and their men fell by scores and
hundreds around them.A hundred led by Armistead, waving his cap on his
sword-point, actually broke through and captured a battery, Armistead
falling beside a gun.Longstreet had been right
when he said: "There never was a body of fifteen thousand men who could
make that attack successfully."Before the converging Federals the thinned
ranks of Confederates drifted wearily back toward Seminary Ridge.Victory
for the South was not to be.[Illustration: MEADE'S HEADQUARTERS ON CEMETERY RIDGE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: WHERE PICKETT CHARGED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The prelude to Pickett's magnificent charge was a sudden deluge of shells
from 150 long-range Confederate guns trained upon Cemetery Ridge.General
Meade and his staff were instantly driven from their headquarters (already
illustrated) and within five minutes the concentrated artillery fire had
swept every unsheltered position on Cemetery Ridge clear of men.In the
woods, a mile and a half distant, Pickett and his men watched the effect
of the bombardment, expecting the order to "Go Forward" up the <DW72>
(shown in the picture).The Federals had instantly opened with their
eighty available guns, and for three hours the most terrific artillery
duel of the war was kept up.Then the Federal fire slackened, as though
the batteries were silenced.The Confederates' artillery ammunition also
was now low.And at
Longstreet's reluctant nod the commander led his 14,000 Virginians across
the plain in their tragic charge up Cemetery Ridge.[Illustration: GENERAL L. A. ARMISTEAD, C. S.In that historic charge was Armistead, who achieved a momentary victory
and met a hero's death.On across the Emmitsburg road came Pickett's
dauntless brigades, coolly closing up the fearful chasms torn in their
ranks by the canister.Up to the fence held by Hays' brigade dashed the
first gray line, only to be swept into confusion by a cruel enfilading
fire.Then the brigades of Armistead and Garnett moved forward, driving
Hays' brigade back through the batteries on the crest.Despite the
death-dealing bolts on all sides, Pickett determined to capture the guns;
and, at the order, Armistead, leaping the fence and waving his cap on his
sword-point, rushed forward, followed by about a hundred of his men.Up to
the very crest they fought the Federals back, and Armistead, shouting,
"Give them the cold steel, boys!"For a moment the
Confederate flag waved triumphantly over the Federal battery.For a brief
interval the fight raged fiercely at close quarters.Armistead was shot
down beside the gun he had taken, and his men were driven back.Pickett,
as he looked around the top of the ridge he had gained, could see his men
fighting all about with clubbed muskets and even flagstaffs against the
troops that were rushing in upon them from all sides.Flesh and blood
could not hold the heights against such terrible odds, and with a heart
full of anguish Pickett ordered a retreat.The despairing Longstreet,
watching from Seminary Ridge, saw through the smoke the shattered remnants
drift sullenly down the <DW72> and knew that Pickett's glorious but costly
charge was ended.[Illustration: THE MAN WHO HELD THE CENTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Headquarters of Brigadier-General Alexander S. Webb.It devolved upon the
man pictured here (booted and in full uniform, before his headquarters
tent to the left of the picture) to meet the shock of Pickett's great
charge.With four Pennsylvania regiments (the Sixty-Ninth, Seventy-First,
Seventy-Second, and One Hundred and Sixth) of Hancock's Second Corps, Webb
was equal to the emergency.Stirred to great deeds by the example of a
patriotic ancestry, he felt that upon his holding his position depended
the outcome of the day.His front had been the focus of the Confederate
artillery fire.Batteries to right and left of his line were practically
silenced.Young Lieutenant Cushing, mortally wounded, fired the last
serviceable gun and fell dead as Pickett's men came on.Cowan's First New
York Battery on the left of Cushing's used canister on the assailants at
less than ten yards.Webb at the head of the Seventy-Second Pennsylvania
fought back the on-rush, posting a line of slightly wounded in his rear.Webb himself fell wounded but his command checked the assault till Hall's
brilliant charge turned the tide at this point.[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER WITH GENERAL

Point in 1861.As captain of volunteers he served with McClellan on the
Peninsula.In June, 1863, he was made brigadier-general of volunteers and
as the head of a brigade of cavalry distinguished himself at Gettysburg.Later he served with Sheridan in the Shenandoah, won honor at Cedar Creek,
and was brevetted major-general of volunteers on October 19, 1864.Under
Sheridan he participated in the battles of Five Forks, Dinwiddie Court
House, and other important cavalry engagements of Grant's last campaign.[Illustration: SUMTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Searching all history for a parallel, it is impossible to find any
defenses of a beleaguered city that stood so severe a bombardment as did
this bravely defended and never conquered fortress of Sumter, in
Charleston Harbor.It is estimated that about eighty thousand projectiles
were discharged from the fleet and the marsh batteries, and yet
Charleston, with its battered water-front, was not abandoned until all
other Confederate positions along the Atlantic Coast were in Federal hands
and Sherman's triumphant army was sweeping in from the West and South.The
picture shows Sumter from the Confederate Fort Johnson.The powerful
batteries in the foreground played havoc with the Federal fleet whenever
it came down the main ship-channel to engage the forts.Protected by
almost impassable swamps, morasses, and a network of creeks to the
eastward, Fort Johnson held an almost impregnable position; and from its
protection by Cummings' Point, on which was Battery Gregg, the Federal
fleet could not approach nearer than two miles.Could it have been taken
by land assault or reduced by gun-fire, Charleston would have fallen.[Illustration: WHERE SHOT AND SHELL STRUCK SUMTER]

These views show the result of the bombardment from August 17 to 23, 1863.The object was to force the surrender of the fort and thus effect an
entrance into Charleston.The report of Colonel John W. Turner, Federal
chief of artillery runs: "The fire from the breaching batteries upon
Sumter was incessant, and kept up continuously from daylight till dark,
until the evening of the 23d.... The fire upon the gorge had, by the
morning of the 23d, succeeded in destroying every gun upon the parapet of
it.The parapet and ramparts of the gorge were completely demolished for
nearly the entire length of the face, and in places everything was swept
off down to the arches, the _debris_ forming an accessible ramp to the top
of the ruins.Nothing further being gained by a longer fire upon this
face, all the guns were directed this day upon the southeasterly flank,
and continued an incessant fire throughout the day.The demolition of the
fort at the close of the day's firing was complete, so far as its
offensive powers were considered."[Illustration: SOME OF THE 450 SHOT A DAY]

twenty-seventh round by a shell bursting in the muzzle, blowing off about
20 inches of the barrel.After the bursting the gun was "chipped" back
beyond the termination of the fracture and afterwards fired 371 rounds
with as good results as before the injury.At the end of that time the
muzzle began to crack again, rendering the gun entirely useless.[Illustration: TWO PARROTTS IN BATTERY STEVENS

batteries "on the left," as they were designated, were pounding away at
Fort Sumter.[Illustration: IN CHARLESTON AFTER THE BOMBARDMENT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.So long as the Confederate flag flew over the ramparts of Sumter,
Charleston remained the one stronghold of the South that was firmly held.It was lowered for an evacuation, not a
surrender.The story of Charleston's determined resistance did not end in
triumph for the South, but it did leave behind it a sunset glory, in which
the valor and dash of the Federal attack is paralleled by the heroism and
self-sacrifice of the Confederate defense, in spite of wreck and ruin.[Illustration: SCENE OF THE NIGHT ATTACK ON SUMTER, SEPTEMBER 8, 1863]

The lower picture was taken after the war, when relic-hunters had removed
the shells, and a beacon light had been erected where once stood the
parapet.On September 8, 1863, at the very position in these photographs,
the garrison repelled a bold assault with musketry fire alone, causing the
Federals severe loss.The flag of the Confederacy floated triumphantly
over the position during the whole of the long struggle.Every effort of
the Federals to reduce the crumbling ruins into submission was unavailing.It stood the continual bombardment of ironclads until it was nothing but a
mass of brickdust, but still the gallant garrison held it.It is strange
that despite the awful destruction the loss of lives within the fort was
few.For weeks the bombardment, assisted by the guns of the fleet, tore
great chasms in the parapet.Fort Sumter never fell, but was abandoned
only on the approach of Sherman's army.It had withstood continuous
efforts against it for 587 days.From April, 1863, to September of the
same year, the fortress was garrisoned by the First South Carolina
Artillery, enlisted as regulars.Afterward the garrison was made up of
detachments of infantry from Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.Artillerists also served turns of duty during this period.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: RALLYING THE LINE._Painted by C. D. Graves._

CHICKAMAUGA--THE BLOODIEST CONFLICT IN THE WEST

    In its dimensions and its murderousness the battle of Chickamauga was
    the greatest battle fought by our Western armies, and one of the
    greatest of modern times.In our Civil War it was exceeded only by
    Gettysburg and the Wilderness; in European history we may compare with
    it such battles as Neerwinden, or Malplaquet, or Waterloo.--_John
    Fiske in "The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War."_


The town of Chattanooga, Tennessee, lies in a great bend of the Tennessee
River and within a vast amphitheater of mountains, ranging in a general
southwesterly direction, and traversed at intervals by great depressions
or valleys.These passes form a natural gateway from the mid-Mississippi
valley to the seaboard States.To dislodge the Confederate army under
General Bragg from this natural fortress would remove the last barrier to
the invading Federals, and permit an easy entry upon the plains of
Georgia.The importance of this position was readily apparent to the
Confederate Government, and any approach by the Federal forces toward this
point was almost certain to be met by stubborn resistance.Rosecrans' forward movement from Murfreesboro, in the early summer of
1863, forced Bragg over the Cumberland Mountains and across the Tennessee.The Confederate leader destroyed the railroad bridge at Bridgeport and
entrenched himself in and around Chattanooga.The three Federal corps
under Crittenden, Thomas and McCook crossed the Tennessee without meeting
resistance, and began to endanger Bragg's lines of communication.But on
September 8th, before their moves had been accomplished, Bragg abandoned
his stronghold.Crittenden the next day marched around the north end of
Lookout and entered the town, while Hazen and Wagner crossed over from the
opposite bank of the Tennessee.Rosecrans believed that Bragg was in full retreat toward Rome, Georgia,
and Crittenden, leaving one brigade in Chattanooga, was ordered to pursue.Bragg encouraged his adversary in the belief that he was avoiding an
engagement and sent spies as deserters into the Federal ranks to narrate
the details of his flight.Meanwhile, he was concentrating at Lafayette,
about twenty-five miles south of Chattanooga.Hither General S. B.
Buckner, entirely too weak to cope with Burnside's heavy column
approaching from Kentucky, brought his troops from Knoxville.Breckinridge
and two brigades arrived from Mississippi, while twelve thousand of Lee's
veterans, under Lee's most trusted and illustrious lieutenant, Longstreet,
were hastening from Virginia to add their numbers to Bragg's Army of
Tennessee.The three corps of the Union army, as we have seen, were now separated
over a wide extent of territory by intervening ridges, so intent was
Rosecrans on intercepting the vanished Bragg.But the latter, by no means
vanished, and with his face toward Chattanooga, considered the position of
his antagonist and discovered his own army almost opposite the Federal
center.Crittenden was advancing toward Ringgold, and the remoteness of
Thomas' corps on his right precluded any immediate union of the Federal
forces.Bragg was quick to grasp the opportunity made by Rosecrans' division of
the army in the face of his opponent.He at once perceived the
possibilities of a master-stroke; to crush Thomas' advanced divisions with
an overwhelming force.The attempt failed, owing to a delay in the attack, which permitted the
endangered Baird and Negley to fall back.Bragg then resolved to throw
himself upon Crittenden, who had divided his corps.Polk was ordered to
advance upon that portion of it at Lee and Gordon's Mills, but when Bragg
came to the front September 13th, expecting to witness the annihilation
of the Twenty-first Corps, he found to his bitter disappointment that the
bishop-general had made no move and that Crittenden had reunited his
divisions and was safe on the west bank of the Chickamauga.Thus his
splendid chances of breaking up the Army of the Cumberland were ruined.When Bragg's position became known to Rosecrans, great was his haste to
effect the concentration of his army.Couriers dashed toward Alpine with
orders for McCook to join Thomas with the utmost celerity.The former
started at once, shortly after midnight on the 13th, in response to
Thomas's urgent call.It was a real race of life and death, attended by
the greatest hardships.Ignorant of the roads, McCook submitted his troops
to a most exhausting march, twice up and down the mountain, fifty-seven
miles of the most arduous toil, often dragging artillery up by hand and
letting it down steep declines by means of ropes.But he closed up with
Thomas on the 17th, and the Army of the Cumberland was saved from its
desperate peril.Crittenden's corps now took position at Lee and Gordon's Mills on the left
bank of Chickamauga Creek, and the Federal troops were all within
supporting distance.In the Indian tongue Chickamauga means "The River of
Death," a name strangely prophetic of that gigantic conflict soon to be
waged by these hostile forces throughout this beautiful and heretofore
peaceful valley.The Confederate army, its corps under Generals Polk, D. H. Hill, and
Buckner, was stationed on the east side of the stream, its right wing
below Lee and Gordon's Mills, and the left extending up the creek toward
Lafayette.On the Federal side Thomas was moved to the left, with
Crittenden in the center and McCook on the right.Their strength has been
estimated at fifty-five to sixty-nine thousand men.On the 18th,
Longstreet's troops were arriving from Virginia, and by the morning of the
19th the greater part of the Confederate army had crossed the
Chickamauga.The two mighty armies were now face to face, and none could
doubt that the impending struggle would be attended by frightful loss to
both sides.It was Bragg's intention to send Polk, commanding the right wing, in a
flanking movement against the Federal left under Thomas, and thus
intervene between it and Chattanooga.The first encounter, at 10 o'clock
in the morning of the 19th, resulted in a Confederate repulse, but fresh
divisions were constantly pushed forward under the deadly fire of the
Federal artillery.The Federals were gradually forced back by the
incessant charge of the Confederates; but assailed and assailant fought
with such great courage and determination that any decided advantage was
withheld from either.Meanwhile, the Federal right was hard pressed by
Hood, commanding Longstreet's corps, and a desperate battle ensued along
the entire line.It seemed, however, more like a struggle between separate
divisions than the clash of two great armies.When night descended the
Federals had been forced back from the creek, but the result had been
indecisive.Disaster to the Union army had been averted by the use of powerful
artillery when the infantry seemed unable to withstand the onslaught.Rosecrans had assumed the defensive, and his troops had so far receded as
to enable the Confederates to form their lines on all the territory fought
over on that day.During the night preparations were made in both camps
for a renewal of the battle on the following morning, which was Sunday.A
fresh disposition of the troops was made by both leaders.Near midnight
General Longstreet arrived on the field, and was once placed in command of
the Confederate left, Polk retaining the right.Not all of Longstreet's
troops arrived in time for the battle, but Bragg's force has been
estimated at fifty-one to seventy-one thousand strong.Thomas was given command of the Union left, with McCook at his right,
while Crittenden's forces occupied the center, but to the rear of both
Thomas and McCook.Thomas had spent the night in throwing up breastworks
on the brow of Snodgrass Hill, as it was anticipated that the Confederates
would concentrate their attack upon his position.Hostilities began with a general movement of the Confederate right wing in
an attempt to flank the Union left.General Bragg had ordered Polk to
begin the attack at daybreak, but it was nearly ten o'clock in the morning
before Breckinridge's division, supported by General Cleburne, advanced
upon Thomas' entrenchments.Fighting desperately, the Confederates did not
falter under the heavy fire of the Federals, and it seemed as if the
latter must be driven from their position.Rosecrans, in response to
urgent requests for reenforcements, despatched troops again and again to
the aid of Thomas, and the assault was finally repulsed.Cleburne's
division was driven back with heavy loss, and Breckinridge, unable to
retain any advantage, was forced to defend his right, which was being
seriously menaced.The battle at this point had been desperately waged,
both sides exhibiting marked courage and determination.As on the previous
day, the Confederates had been the aggressors, but the Federal troops had
resisted all attempts to invade their breastworks.However, the fortunes of battle were soon to incline to the side of the
Southern army.Bragg sent Stewart's division forward, and it pressed
Reynolds' and Brannan's men back to their entrenchments.Rosecrans sent
Wood word to close up on Reynolds.Through some misunderstanding in giving
or interpreting this order, General Wood withdrew his division from its
position on the right of Brannan.By this movement a large opening was
left almost in the center of the battle-line.Johnson's, Hindman's, and
Kershaw's divisions rushed into the gap and fell upon the Union right and
center with an impetus that was irresistible.The Confederate general,
Bushrod Johnson, has given us an unforgetable picture of the thrilling
event: "The resolute and impetuous charge, the rush of our heavy columns
sweeping out from the shadow and gloom of the forest into the open fields
flooded with sunlight, the glitter of arms, the onward dash of artillery
and mounted men, the retreat of the foe, the shouts of the hosts of our
army, the dust, the smoke, the noise of fire-arms--of whistling balls, and
grape-shot, and of bursting shell--made up a battle-scene of unsurpassed
grandeur.Here, General Hood gave me the last order I received from him on
the field, 'Go ahead and keep ahead of everything.'"A moment later, and
Hood fell, severely wounded, with a minie ball in his thigh.Wood's right brigade was shattered even before it had cleared the opening.Sheridan's entire division, and part of Davis' and Van Cleve's, were
driven from the field.Longstreet now gave a fine exhibition of his
military genius.The orders of battle were to separate the two wings of
the opposing army.But with the right wing of his opponents in hopeless
ruin, he wheeled to the right and compelled the further withdrawal of
Federal troops in order to escape being surrounded.The brave
soldier-poet, William H. Lytle, fell at the head of his brigade as he
strove to re-form his line.McCook and Crittenden were unable, in spite of
several gallant efforts, to rally their troops and keep back the onrushing
heroes of Stone's River and Bull Run.The broken mass fled in confusion
toward Chattanooga, carrying with it McCook, Crittenden, and Rosecrans.The latter telegraphed to Washington that his army had been beaten.In
this famous charge the Confederates took several thousand prisoners and
forty pieces of artillery.Flushed with victory, the Confederates now concentrated their attack upon
Thomas, who thus far, on Horseshoe Ridge and its spurs, had repelled all
attempts to dislodge him.The Confederates, with victory within their
grasp, and led by the indomitable Longstreet, swarmed up the <DW72>s in
great numbers, but they were hurled back with fearful slaughter.Thomas
was looking anxiously for Sheridan, whom, as he knew, Rosecrans had
ordered with two brigades to his support.But in Longstreet's rout of the
right wing Sheridan, with the rest, had been carried on toward
Chattanooga, and he found himself completely cut off from Thomas, as the
Confederates were moving parallel to him.Yet the indomitable Sheridan, in
spite of his terrible experience of the morning, did not give up the
attempt.Foiled in his efforts to get through McFarland's Gap, he moved
quickly on Rossville and came down the Lafayette road toward Thomas' left
flank.Meanwhile, advised by the incessant roar of musketry, General Gordon
Granger, in command of the reserve corps near Rossville, advanced rapidly
with his fresh troops.Acting with promptness and alacrity under orders,
Granger sent Steedman to Thomas' right.Directly across the line of Thomas' right was a ridge, on which Longstreet
stationed Hindman with a large command, ready for an attack on Thomas'
flank--a further and terrible menace to the nearly exhausted general, but
it was not all.In the ridge was a small gap, and through this Kershaw was
pouring his division, intent on getting to Thomas' rear.Rosecrans thus
describes the help afforded to Thomas: "Steedman, taking a regimental
color, led the column.Swift was the charge and terrible the conflict, but
the enemy was broken."The fighting grew fiercer, and at intervals was almost hand to hand.The
casualties among the officers, who frequently led their troops in person,
were mounting higher and higher as the moments passed.All the afternoon
the assaults continued, but the Union forces stood their ground.Ammunition ran dangerously low, but Steedman had brought a small supply,
and when this was distributed each man had about ten rounds.Finally, as
the sun was setting in the west, the Confederate troops advanced in a
mighty concourse.The combined forces of Kershaw, Law, Preston, and
Hindman once more rushed forward, gained possession of their lost ridge at
several points, but were unable to drive their attack home.In many places
the Union lines stood firm and both sides rested in the positions taken.The onslaught on the Federal left of the
battlefield was one of the heaviest attacks made on a single point during
the war.History records no grander spectacle than Thomas' stand at Chickamauga.He
was ever afterwards known as "The Rock of Chickamauga."Under the cover of
darkness, Thomas, having received word from Rosecrans to withdraw, retired
his army in good order to Rossville, and on the following day rejoined
Rosecrans in Chattanooga.The battle of Chickamauga, considering the
forces engaged, was one of the most destructive of the Civil War.The
Union army lost approximately sixteen thousand men, and while the loss to
the Confederate army is not definitely known, it was probably nearly
eighteen thousand.The personal daring and tenacious courage displayed in
the ranks of both armies have never been excelled on any battlefield.The
Confederate generals, Helm, Deshler, and Preston Smith were killed; Adams,
Hood, Brown, Gregg, Clayton, Hindman, and McNair were wounded.The battle is generally considered a Confederate victory,
and yet, aside from the terrible loss of human life, no distinct advantage
accrued to either side.The Federal army retained possession of
Chattanooga, but the Confederates had for the time checked the Army of the
Cumberland from a further occupation of Southern soil.It is a singular coincidence that the generals-in-chief of both armies
exercised but little supervision over the movements of their respective
troops.The brunt of the battle fell, for the most part, upon the
commanders of the wings.To the subordinate generals on each side were
awarded the highest honors.Longstreet, because of his eventful charge,
which swept the right wing of the Union army from the field, was
proclaimed the victor of Chickamauga; and to General Thomas, who by his
firmness and courage withstood the combined attack of the Confederate
forces when disaster threatened on every side, is due the brightest
laurels from the adherents of the North.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE LEADER AT CHICKAMAUGA

than that of any other Southern leader because of his brilliant record in
the Mexican War.In the Civil War he distinguished himself first at Shiloh
and by meritorious services thereafter.But his delays rendered him
scarcely a match for Rosecrans, to say nothing of Grant and Sherman.Flanked out of two strong positions, he missed the opportunity presented
by Rosecrans' widely separated forces and failed to crush the Army of the
Cumberland in detail, as it advanced to the battle of Chickamauga.The
error cost the Confederates the loss of Tennessee, eventually.[Illustration: THOMAS--THE "ROCK OF CHICKAMAUGA" WHO BECAME THE "SLEDGE OF

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Major-General George Henry Thomas, Virginia-born soldier loyal to the
Union; commended for gallantry in the Seminole War, and for service in
Mexico; won the battle of Mill Spring, January 19, 1862; commanded the
right wing of the Army of the Tennessee against Corinth and at Perryville,
and the center at Stone's River.Only his stability averted overwhelming
defeat for the Federals at Chickamauga.At Lookout Mountain and Missionary
Ridge he was a host in himself.After Sherman had taken Atlanta he sent
Thomas back to Tennessee to grapple with Hood.How he crushed Hood by his
sledge-hammer blows is told in the story of "Nashville."Thomas, sitting
down in Nashville, bearing the brunt of Grant's impatience, and ignoring
completely the proddings from Washington to advance before he was ready,
while he waited grimly for the psychological moment to strike the oncoming
Confederate host under Hood, is one of the really big dramatic figures of
the entire war.It has been well said of Thomas that every promotion he
received was a reward of merit; and that during his long and varied career
as a soldier no crisis ever arose too great for his ability.[Illustration: BEFORE CHICKAMAUGA--IN THE RUSH OF EVENTS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Rarely does the camera afford such a perfectly contemporaneous record of
the march of events so momentous.This photograph shows the hotel at
Stevenson, Alabama, during the Union advance that ended in Chickamauga.Sentinels are parading the street in front of the hotel, several horses
are tied to the hotel posts, and the officers evidently have gone into the
hotel headquarters.General Alexander McDowell McCook, commanding the old
Twentieth Army Corps, took possession of the hotel as temporary
headquarters on the movement of the Army of the Cumberland from Tullahoma.On August 29, 1863, between Stevenson and Caperton's Ferry, on the
Tennessee River, McCook gathered his boats and pontoons, hidden under the
dense foliage of overhanging trees, and when ready for his crossing
suddenly launched them into and across the river.Thence the troops
marched over Sand Mountain and at length into Lookout Valley.During the
movements the army was in extreme peril, for McCook was at one time three
days' march from Thomas, so that Bragg might have annihilated the
divisions in detail.Finally the scattered corps were concentrated along
Chickamauga Creek, where the bloody struggle of September 19th and 20th
was so bravely fought.[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO CHICKAMAUGA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This solitary observer, if he was standing here September 20, 1863,
shortly before this was photographed, certainly gazed at the base of the
hill to the left.For through the pass called Rossville Gap a column in
blue was streaming--Steedman's Division of the Reserve Corps, rushing to
aid Thomas, so sore pressed at Chickamauga.Those <DW72>s by Chickamauga
Creek witnessed the deadliest battle in the West and the highest in
percentage of killed and wounded of the entire war.It was fought as a
result of Rosecrans' attempt to maneuver Bragg out of Chattanooga.The
Federal army crossed the Tennessee River west of the city, passed through
the mountain-ranges, and came upon Bragg's line of communications.Finding
his position untenable, the Southern leader moved southward and fell upon
the united forces of Rosecrans along Chickamauga Creek.The vital point in
the Federal line was the left, held by Thomas.Should that give way, the
army would be cut off from Chattanooga, with no base to fall back on.The
heavy fighting of September 19th showed that Bragg realized the situation.For a time, the Union army was
driven back.But at nightfall Thomas had regained the lost ground.He
re-formed during the night in order to protect the road leading into
Chattanooga.Since the second day was foggy till the middle of the
forenoon, the fighting was not renewed till late.About noon a break was
made in the right of the Federal battle-line, into which the eager
Longstreet promptly hurled his men.Colonel Dodge writes: "Everything
seems lost.The entire right of the army, with Rosecrans and his staff, is
driven from the field in utter rout.But, unknown even to the commanding
general, Thomas, the Rock of Chickamauga, stands there at bay, surrounded,
facing two to one.Heedless of the wreck of one-half the army, he knows
not how to yield."[Illustration: THE TOO-ADVANCED POSITION

in concentrating his troops on the 18th of September, was still possessed
of the idea that Bragg was covering his retreat upon his railroad
connections at Dalton.Instead, the Confederate commander had massed his
forces on the other side of Chickamauga and was only awaiting the arrival
of Longstreet to assume the aggressive.On the morning of the 19th,
McCook's right wing at Crawfish Spring was strongly threatened by the
Confederates, while the real attack was made against the left in an effort
to turn it and cut Rosecrans off from a retreat upon Chattanooga.All day
long, brigade after brigade was marched from the right of the Federal line
in order to extend the left under Thomas and withstand this flanking
movement.Even after nightfall, Thomas, trying to re-form his lines and
carry them still farther to the left for the work of the morrow, brought
on a sharp conflict in the darkness.The Confederates had been held back,
but at heavy cost.That night, at the Widow Glenn's house, Rosecrans
consulted his generals.The exhausted Thomas, when roused from sleep for
his opinion, invariably answered, "I would strengthen the left."There
seemed as yet to be no crisis at hand, and the council closed with a song
by the debonair McCook.[Illustration: WHERE THE LINES WERE SWEPT BACK

Federal line on the second day at Chickamauga.From it, northward, were
posted the commands of McCook and Crittenden, depleted by the detachments
of troops the day before to strengthen the left.All might have gone well
if the main attack of the Confederates had continued to the left, as
Rosecrans expected.But hidden in the woods, almost within a stone's throw
of the Federal right on that misty morning, was the entire corps of
Longstreet, drawn up in columns of brigades at half distance--"a
masterpiece of tactics," giving space for each column to swing right or
left.Seizing a momentous opportunity which would have lasted but thirty
minutes at the most, Longstreet hurled them through a gap which, owing to
a misunderstanding, had been left open, and the entire Federal right was
swept from the field.[Illustration: THE HOUSE WHENCE HELP CAME

Rossville Gap (the Confederate objective in the battle), General Gordon

miles away, growing more and more ominous.Finally, in disobedience of
orders, he set in motion his three brigades to the relief of Thomas,
pushing forward two of them under Steedman.These arrived upon the field
early in the afternoon, the most critical period of the battle, as
Longstreet charged afresh on Thomas' right and rear.Seizing a
battle-flag, Steedman (at the order of General Granger) led his command in
a counter-charge which saved the Army of the Cumberland.This old house at
Rossville was built by John Ross, a chief of the Cherokee Indians, and he

    flood which had broken these lines was not disappearing.The fountains
    which supplied it were exhaustless.It was still coming with an ever
    increasing current, swelling higher and growing more resistless.This
    triune disaster [Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Missionary Ridge] was
    especially depressing to the people because it came like a blight upon
    their hopes which had been awakened by recent Confederate
    victories."--_General John B. Gordon, C. S. A., in "Reminiscences of
    the Civil War."_


Following the defeat of Rosecrans' army at Chickamauga in September 1863
Bragg at once took strong positions on Missionary Ridge and Lookout
Mountain.From these heights he was able to besiege the entire Army of the
Cumberland in Chattanooga and obstruct the main arteries of supply to the
Federal troops.Rosecrans was forced to abandon the route along the south
bank of the Tennessee River, which led from Bridgeport, in Alabama, and to
depend exclusively upon a long and mountainous wagon road on the north
side of the river for the transportation of supplies.The Confederate
cavalry, crossing the Tennessee above Chattanooga, fell upon the trains
entangled in the mud of the Sequatchie valley, destroying in one day three
hundred wagons, and killing or capturing about eighteen hundred mules.Within a short time the wisdom of Bragg's plan became apparent; famine
threatened the Union army and several thousand horses and mules had
already died from starvation.By his relentless vigil, the Confederate
leader seemed destined to achieve a greater victory over his opponent than
had hitherto attended his efforts in actual conflict.Meanwhile, a complete reorganization of the Federal forces in the West was
effected.Under the title of the Military Division of the Mississippi, the
Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the Tennessee were united
with Grant as general commanding, and Rosecrans was replaced by Thomas at
the head of the Army of the Cumberland.A hurried concentration of the Federal forces was now ordered by General
Halleck.Hooker with fifteen thousand men of the Army of the Potomac came
rapidly by rail to Bridgeport.Sherman, with a portion of his army, about
twenty thousand strong, was summoned from Vicksburg and at once embarked
in steamers for Memphis.General Grant decided to assume personal charge
of the Federal forces; but before he reached his new command, Thomas, ably
assisted by his chief engineer, General W. F. Smith, had begun to act on a
plan which Rosecrans had conceived, and which proved in the end to be a
brilliant conception.This was to seize a low range of hills known as
Raccoon Mountain on the peninsula made by a bend of the river, on its
south side and west of Chattanooga, and establish a wagon road to Kelly's
Ferry, a point farther down the river to which supplies could be brought
by boat from Bridgeport, and at the same time communication effected with
Hooker.A direct line was not only secured to Bridgeport, but Hooker advanced with
a portion of his troops into Lookout Valley and after a short but decisive
skirmish drove the Confederates across Lookout Creek, leaving his forces
in possession of the hills he had gained.The route was now opened between
Bridgeport and Brown's Ferry; abundant supplies were at once available and
the Army of the Cumberland relieved of its perilous position.Unlike the condition which had prevailed at Chickamauga, reenforcements
from all sides were hastening to the aid of Thomas' army; Hooker was
already on the ground; Sherman was advancing rapidly from Memphis, and he
arrived in person on November 15th, while Burnside's forces at Knoxville
offered protection to the left flank of the Federal army.The disposition of the Confederate troops at this time was a formidable
one; the left flank rested on the northern end of Lookout Mountain and the
line extended a distance of twelve miles across Chattanooga Valley to
Missionary Ridge.This position was further strengthened by entrenchments
throughout the lowlands.Despite the danger which threatened his army from
the converging Union forces, General Bragg determined to attack Burnside
and despatched Longstreet with twenty thousand of his best troops to
Knoxville.His army materially weakened, the Confederate general continued
to hold the same extended position, although his combined force was
smaller than had opposed Rosecrans alone at Chickamauga.On the 23d of November, after a long and fatiguing march over roads almost
impassable by reason of continuous rains, Sherman crossed the Tennessee by
the pontoon bridge at Brown's Ferry, recrossed it above Chattanooga, and
was assigned a position to the left of the main army near the mouth of
Chickamauga Creek.Grant had now some eighty thousand men, of whom sixty
thousand were on the scene of the coming battle, and, though fearful lest
Burnside should be dislodged from his position at Knoxville, he would not
be diverted from his purpose of sweeping the Confederates from the front
of Chattanooga.It had been Grant's plan to attack on the 24th, but
information reached him that Bragg was preparing a retreat.He, therefore,
on the 23d, ordered Thomas to advance upon Bragg's center.Preparations for movement were made in full view of the Confederates; from
the appearance of the troops, clad in their best uniforms, the advance
line of the Southern army was content to watch this display, in the belief
that the maneuvering army was parading in review.Suddenly, the peaceful
pageant turned into a furious charge, before which the Confederate
pickets, taken by surprise, retreated from the first line of earthworks,
and Thomas, with little loss to either side, captured Orchard Knob,
between Chattanooga and Missionary Ridge.From this point, which was
almost a mile in advance of the position occupied during the morning,
Grant directed the movements of his army on the following day.The Federal position was of less extent than that occupied by the
Confederates.Sherman was in command of the left wing, while Thomas held
the center, and "Fighting Joe" Hooker, with the Union right in Lookout
Valley, threatened Lookout Mountain.The plan of battle was for Sherman to
engage the Confederate right and sever communications between Bragg and
Longstreet; Hooker was to carry out an assault on the Southern left flank,
and at the same time maintain connection with Bridgeport.With both wings
assailed by a superior force, it was believed that Bragg must reenforce
these positions and permit Thomas, with overwhelming numbers, to
concentrate upon the center.On the 24th, two distinct movements were in progress.Sherman met with but
little opposition in his initial attack upon the Confederate right and
promptly seized and occupied the north end of Missionary Ridge.The
Confederates, late in the afternoon, fought desperately to regain the hill
but were finally repulsed, and Sherman fortified the position he had
gained.In the mean time, Hooker, early in the day, had begun his
operations against Lookout Mountain.Standing like a lone sentinel above
the surrounding valleys, its steep, rocky, and deeply furrowed <DW72>s,
rising into a high, palisaded crest, frowned defiance upon the advancing
troops, while a well-constructed line of defenses completed the imposing
barrier.Hooker had in addition to his own troops a division of Sherman's army
(Osterhaus') which, owing to damage to the pontoon bridge at Brown's
Ferry, had been prevented from joining its own leader.As ordered by
Hooker, General Geary took his division up the valley to Wauhatchie,
crossed the creek and marched down the east bank, sweeping the
Confederate outposts before him.The remainder of the command got across
by bridges lower down.Gaining the <DW72>s of the mountain the Federal
troops rushed on in their advance.From the high palisaded summit,
invisible in the low-hanging clouds, the guns of General Stevenson's
brigades poured an iron deluge upon them.But on they went, climbing over
ledges and boulders, up hill and down, while the soldiers of the South
with musket and cannon tried in vain to check them.Position after
position was abandoned to the onrushing Federals, and by noon Geary's
advanced troops had rounded the north <DW72> of the mountain and passed
from the sight of General Hooker, who was watching the contest from a
vantage point to the west.Grant and Thomas from the headquarters on
Orchard Knob were likewise eager witnesses of the struggle, although the
haze was so dense that they caught a glimpse only now and then as the
clouds would rise.Reenforcements came to the Confederates and they availed nothing.Geary's
troops had been ordered to halt when they reached the foot of the
palisades, but fired by success they pressed impetuously forward.From its
higher position at the base of the cliff Cobham's brigade showered volley
after volley upon the Confederate main line of defense, while that of
Ireland gradually rolled up the flank.The Federal batteries on Moccasin
Point across the river were doing what they could to clear the mountain.The Southerners made a last stand in their walls and pits around the
Craven house, but were finally driven in force over rocks and precipices
into Chattanooga Valley.Such was the "battle in the clouds," a wonderful spectacle denied the
remainder of Hooker's troops holding Lookout Valley.That general says,
"From the moment we had rounded the peak of the mountain it was only from
the roar of battle and the occasional glimpses our comrades in the valley
could catch of our lines and standards that they knew of the strife or
its progress, and when from these evidences our true condition was
revealed to them their painful anxiety yielded to transports of joy which
only soldiers can feel in the earliest moments of dawning victory."By two in the afternoon the clouds had settled completely into the valley
and the ensuing darkness put an end to further operations.Hooker
established and strengthened a new position and waited for reenforcements,
which General Carlin brought from Chattanooga at five o'clock.Until after
midnight an irregular fire was kept up, but the Confederates could not
break the new line.Before dawn General Stevenson abandoned the summit,
leaving behind twenty thousand rations and the camp equipage of his three
brigades.Hooker, anticipating this move, sent several detachments to
scale the palisades.A party of six men from the Eighth Kentucky regiment,
by means of ladders, was the first to reach the summit, and the waving
Stars and Stripes greeted the rising sun of November 25th on Lookout
Mountain, amid the wild and prolonged cheers of "Fighting Joe's" valiant
troops.The fighting of Sherman and Hooker on the 24th secured to Grant's army a
distinct advantage in position.From the north end of Lookout Mountain
across Chattanooga Valley to the north end of Missionary Ridge the Union
forces maintained an unbroken front.The morning of the 25th dawned cold, and an impenetrable mist which lay
deep in the valleys was soon driven away.From Orchard Knob, a point
almost in the center of the united Federal host, General Grant watched the
preparations for the battle.At sunrise, Sherman's command was in motion.In his front, an open space intervened between his position and a ridge
held by the Confederates, while just beyond rose a much higher hill.Toward the first ridge the attacking column, under General Corse, advanced
rapidly and in full view of the foe.For a time it seemed as if the
Confederates must recede before the terrific onslaught, but the advance
was abruptly checked after a very close and stubborn struggle, when
within a short distance of the entrenchment.Unmindful of the numbers which opposed him, General Hardee not only
succeeded in repulsing the attack, but, assuming the offensive, drove back
the forces under General John E. Smith, who had sought to turn his left,
and captured several hundred prisoners.The Federals, quickly re-forming
their lines, renewed the assault and for several hours the fighting was
desperate on both sides.A general advance of the Northern forces had been
withheld, awaiting the arrival of Hooker who, under orders from Grant, was
sweeping down Chickamauga Valley, and was to operate against the
Confederate left and rear, in the expectation that Bragg would further
weaken his line by massing at those points.But Hooker's army had been
delayed several hours by repairs to the bridge crossing Chattanooga Creek.Although Sherman had failed in his attempt to turn the Confederate right
he had forced Bragg to draw heavily upon his center for reenforcements.Grant, satisfied that Hooker was not far off, ordered the signal--six guns
fired in rapid succession from the battery on Orchard Knob--for a general
advance of Thomas' army upon the Confederate center.It was now three o'clock in the afternoon.The four division commanders of
the Army of the Cumberland, Sheridan, Wood, Baird, and Johnson, gave the
word to advance.Between Orchard Knob and the base of Missionary Ridge, a
mile away, is a broad valley covered for the most part with heavy timber.This had to be crossed before the entrenchments at the foot of the hill
could be assaulted.Scarcely were the Cumberland troops in motion when
fifty pieces of artillery on the crest of Missionary Ridge opened a
terrific fire upon them.But the onward rush of the Federals was not
checked in the slightest degree.The line of entrenchments at the base was
carried with little opposition.Most of Breckinridge's men abandoned the
ditches as the Federal skirmishers approached and sought refuge up the
hill, breaking and throwing into confusion other troops as they passed
through.At the foot of Missionary Ridge Thomas' army had reached its goal.But, as General Wood has related, "the
enthusiasm and impetuosity of the troops were such that those who first
reached the entrenchments at the base of the ridge bounded over them and
pressed on up the ascent.... Moreover the entrenchments were no protection
against the artillery on the ridge.To remain would be destruction--to
return would be both expensive in life, and disgraceful.Officers and men,
all seemed impressed with this truth.... Without waiting for an order the
vast mass pressed forward in the race for glory, each man anxious to be
the first on the summit.... Artillery and musketry could not check the
impetuous assault.To have done so would
have been ruinous.Little was left to the commanders of the troops than to
cheer on the foremost--to encourage the weaker of limb and to sustain the
very few who seemed to be faint-hearted."Midway up the <DW72> was a small line of rifle-pits, but these proved of no
use in stemming the Federal tide.In the immediate front, however, Major
Weaver of the Sixtieth North Carolina rallied a sufficient number of the
demoralized Confederates to send a well-directed and effective fire upon
the advancing troops.At this point the first line of oncoming Federals
was vigorously repulsed, and thrown back to the vacated Confederate
trenches.General Bragg, noticing this, rode along the ridge to spread his
good news among the troops, but he had not gone far when word was brought
that the right flank was broken and that the Federal standard had been
seen on the summit.A second and a third flag appeared in quick
succession.Bragg sent General Bate to drive the foe back, but the
disaster was so great that the latter was unable to repair it.Even the
artillery had abandoned the infantry.The Confederate flank had gone, and
within an hour of the start from Orchard Knob the crest of Missionary
Ridge was occupied by Federal troops.He went
down the eastern <DW72>, driving all in front of him toward Chickamauga
Creek.On a more easterly ridge he rested until midnight, when he advanced
to the creek and took many prisoners and stores.While the Army of the Cumberland accomplished these things, Hooker was
advancing his divisions at charging pace from the south.Cruft was on the
crest, Osterhaus in the eastern valley, and Geary in the western--all
within easy supporting distance.Before Cruft's onrush the left wing of
Bragg's army was scattered in all directions from the ridge.Many ran down
the eastern <DW72> into Osterhaus' column and the very few who chose a way
of flight to the west, were captured by Geary.The bulk of them, however,
fell back from trench to trench upon the crest until finally, as the sun
was sinking, they found themselves surrounded by Johnson's division of the
Army of the Cumberland.Such was the fate of Stewart's division; only a
small portion of it got away.On the Confederate right Hardee held his own against Sherman, but with the
left and center routed and in rapid flight Bragg realized the day was
lost.He could do nothing but cover Breckinridge's retreat as best he
might and order Hardee to retire across Chickamauga Creek.Bragg's army had been wholly
defeated, and, after being pursued for some days, it found a resting place
at Dalton among the mountains of Georgia.The Federal victory was the
result of a campaign carefully planned by Generals Halleck and Grant and
ably carried out by the efforts of the subordinate generals.The losses in killed and wounded sustained by Grant were over fifty-eight
hundred and those of Bragg about sixty-six hundred, four thousand being
prisoners.But the advantage of the great position had been forever
wrested from the Southern army.[Illustration: THE BESIEGED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.At this point, where Citico Creek joins the Tennessee, the left of the
Eleventh Corps of the Army of the Cumberland rested on the river bank, the
limit of the Federal line of defense, east of Chattanooga.Here, on high
ground overlooking the stream, was posted Battery McAloon to keep the
Confederates back from the river, so that timber and firewood could be
rafted down to the besieged army.In the chill of autumn, with scanty
rations, the soldiers had a hard time keeping warm, as all fuel within the
lines had been consumed.The Army of the Cumberland was almost conquered
by hardship.Grant feared that the soldiers "could not be got out of their
trenches to assume the offensive."But it was these very men who achieved
the most signal victory in the battle of Chattanooga.[Illustration: OPENING "THE CRACKER LINE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]_Chattanooga_ was the first steamboat built by the Federals
on the upper Tennessee River.Had the gunboats on the Ohio been able to
come up the Tennessee River nearly three hundred miles, to the assistance
of Rosecrans, Bragg could never have bottled him up in Chattanooga.But
between Florence and Decatur, Alabama, Muscle Shoals lay in the stream,
making the river impassable.While Bragg's pickets invested the railroad
and river, supplies could not be brought up from Bridgeport; and besides,
with the exception of one small steamboat (the _Dunbar_), the Federals had
no boats on the river.General W. F. Smith, Chief Engineer of the Army of
the Cumberland, had established a saw-mill with an old engine at
Bridgeport for the purpose of getting out lumber from logs rafted down the
river, with which to construct pontoons.Here Captain Arthur Edwards,
Assistant Quartermaster, had been endeavoring since the siege began to
build a steamboat consisting of a flat-bottom scow, with engine, boiler,
and stern-wheel mounted upon it.On October 24th, after many difficulties
and discouragements had been overcome, the vessel was launched
successfully and christened the _Chattanooga_.On the 29th she made her
trial trip.That very night, Hooker, in the battle of Wauhatchie,
definitely established control of the new twelve-mile "Cracker Line" from
Kelley's Ferry, which Grant had ordered for the relief of the starving

Chattanooga.The mechanics were still at work upon the little vessel's
unfinished pilot-house and boiler-deck while she and the two barges she
was to tow were being loaded, and at 4 A.M.on November 30th she set out
to make the 45-mile journey against unfavorable head-winds.[Illustration: THE WELCOME NEWCOMER

THE BATTLE IN THE WILDERNESS

    The volunteers who composed the armies of the Potomac and Northern
    Virginia were real soldiers now, inured to war, and desperate in their
    determination to do its work without faltering or failure.This
    fact--this change in the temper and _morale_ of the men on either
    side--had greatly simplified the tasks set for Grant and Lee to solve.They knew that those men would stand against
    anything, endure slaughter without flinching, hardship without
    complaining, and make desperate endeavor without shrinking.The two
    armies had become what they had not been earlier in the contest,
    _perfect instruments of war_, that could be relied upon as confidently
    as the machinist relies upon his engine scheduled to make so many
    revolutions per minute at a given rate of horse-power, and with the
    precision of science itself.--_George Cary Eggleston, in "The History
    of the Confederate War."_


After the battle of Gettysburg, Lee started for the Potomac, which he
crossed with some difficulty, but with little interruption from the
Federals, above Harper's Ferry, on July 14, 1863.The thwarted invader of
Pennsylvania wished to get to the plains of Virginia as quickly as
possible, but the Shenandoah was found to be impassable.Meade, in the
mean time, had crossed the Potomac east of the Blue Ridge and seized the
principal outlets from the lower part of the Valley.Lee, therefore, was
compelled to continue his retreat up the Shenandoah until Longstreet, sent
in advance with part of his command, had so blocked the Federal pursuit
that most of the Confederate army was able to emerge through Chester Gap
and move to Culpeper Court House.Ewell marched through Thornton's Gap and
by the 4th of August practically the whole Army of Northern Virginia was
south of the Rapidan, prepared to dispute the crossing of that river.But
Meade, continuing his flank pursuit, halted at Culpeper Court House,
deeming it imprudent to attempt the Rapidan in the face of the strongly
entrenched Confederates.In the entire movement there had been no fighting
except a few cavalry skirmishes and no serious loss on either side.On the 9th of September, Lee sent Longstreet and his corps to assist Bragg
in the great conflict that was seen to be inevitable around Chattanooga.In spite of reduced strength, Lee proceeded to assume a threatening
attitude toward Meade, and in October and early November there were
several small but severe engagements as the Confederate leader attempted
to turn Meade's flank and force him back to the old line of Bull Run.On
the 7th of November, Sedgwick made a brilliant capture of the redoubts on
the Rappahannock, and Lee returned once more to his old position on the
south side of the Rapidan.This lay between Barnett's Ford, near Orange
Court House (Lee's headquarters), and Morton's Ford, twenty miles below.Its right was also protected by entrenchments along the course of Mine
Run.Against these, in the last days of November, Meade sent French,
Sedgwick, and Warren.It was found impossible to carry the Confederate
position, and on December 1st the Federal troops were ordered to recross
the Rapidan.In this short campaign the Union lost sixteen hundred men and
the Confederacy half that number.With the exception of an unsuccessful
cavalry raid against Richmond, in February, nothing disturbed the
existence of the two armies until the coming of Grant.In the early months of 1864, the Army of the Potomac lay between the
Rapidan and the Rappahannock, most of it in the vicinity of Culpeper Court
House, although some of the troops were guarding the railroad to
Washington as far as Bristoe Station, close to Manassas Junction.On the
south side of the Rapidan, the Army of Northern Virginia was, as has been
seen, securely entrenched.The Confederates' ranks were thin and their
supplies were scarce; but the valiant spirit which had characterized the
Southern hosts in former battles still burned fiercely within their
breasts, presaging many desperate battles before the heel of the invader
should tread upon their cherished capital, Richmond, and their loved
cause, the Confederacy.Within the camp religious services had been held for weeks in succession,
resulting in the conversion of large numbers of the soldiers.The influence of the awakening among the men in the
army during this revival was manifest after the war was over, when the
soldiers had gone back to civil life, under conditions most trying and
severe.To this spiritual frame of mind may be credited, perhaps, some of
the remarkable feats accomplished in subsequent battles by the Confederate
army.On February 29, 1864, the United States Congress passed law reviving the
grade of lieutenant-general, the title being intended for Grant, who was
made general-in-chief of the armies of the United States.Grant had come
from his victorious battle-grounds in the West, and all eyes turned to him
as the chieftain who should lead the Union army to success.On the 9th of
March he received his commission.He now planned the final great double
movement of the war.Taking control of the whole campaign against Lee, but
leaving the Army of the Potomac under Meade's direct command, he chose the
strongest of his corps commanders, W. T. Sherman, for the head of affairs
in the West.Grant's immediate objects were to defeat Lee's army and to
capture Richmond, the latter to be accomplished by General Butler and the
Army of the James; Sherman's object was to crush Johnston, to seize that
important railroad center, Atlanta, Georgia, and, with Banks' assistance,
to open a way between the Atlantic coast and Mobile, on the Gulf, thus
dividing the Confederacy north and south, as the conquest of the
Mississippi had parted it east and west.It was believed that if either or
both of these campaigns were successful, the downfall of the Confederacy
would be assured.On a recommendation of General Meade's, the Army of the Potomac was
reorganized into three corps instead of the previous five.The Second,
Fifth, and Sixth corps were retained, absorbing the First and Third.Hancock was in command of the Second; Warren, the Fifth; and Sedgwick, the
Sixth.Sheridan was at the head of the cavalry.The Ninth Corps acted as a
separate army under Burnside, and was now protecting the Orange and
Alexandria Railroad.As soon as Meade had crossed the Rapidan, Burnside
was ordered to move promptly, and he reached the battlefield of the
Wilderness on the morning of May 6th.On May 24th his corps was assigned
to the Army of the Potomac.The Union forces, including the Ninth Corps,
numbered about one hundred and eighteen thousand men.The Army of Northern Virginia consisted of three corps of infantry, the
First under Longstreet, the Second under Ewell, and the Third under A. P.
Hill, and a cavalry corps commanded by Stuart.A notable fact in the
organization of the Confederate army was the few changes made in
commanders.The total forces under Lee were about sixty-two thousand.After assuming command, Grant established his headquarters at Culpeper
Court House, whence he visited Washington once a week to consult with
President Lincoln and the Secretary of War.He was given full authority,
however, as to men and movements, and worked out a plan of campaign which
resulted in a series of battles in Virginia unparalleled in history.The
first of these was precipitated in a dense forest, a wilderness, from
which the battle takes its name.Grant decided on a general advance of the Army of the Potomac upon Lee,
and early on the morning of May 4th the movement began by crossing the
Rapidan at several fords below Lee's entrenched position, and moving by
his right flank.The crossing was effected successfully, the line of march
taking part of the Federal troops over a scene of defeat in the previous
spring.One year before, the magnificent Army of the Potomac, just from a
long winter's rest in the encampment at Falmouth on the north bank of the
Rappahannock, had met the legions of the South in deadly combat on the
battlefield of Chancellorsville.And now Grant was leading the same army,
whose ranks had been freshened by new recruits from the North, through the
same field of war.By eight o'clock on the morning of the 4th the various rumors as to the
Federal army's crossing the Rapidan received by Lee were fully confirmed,
and at once he prepared to set his own army in motion for the Wilderness,
and to throw himself across the path of his foe.Two days before he had
gathered his corps and division commanders around him at the signal
station on Clark's Mountain, a considerable eminence south of the Rapidan,
near Robertson's Ford.Here he expressed the opinion that Grant would
cross at the lower fords, as he did, but nevertheless Longstreet was kept
at Gordonsville in case the Federals should move by the Confederate left.The day was oppressively hot, and the troops suffered greatly from thirst
as they plodded along the forest aisles through the jungle-like region.The Wilderness was a maze of trees, underbrush, and ragged foliage.Low-limbed pines, scrub-oaks, hazels, and chinkapins interlaced their
branches on the sides of rough country roads that lead through this
labyrinth of desolation.The weary troops looked upon the heavy tangles of
fallen timber and dense undergrowth with a sense of isolation.Only the
sounds of the birds in the trees, the rustling of the leaves, and the
passing of the army relieved the heavy pall of solitude that bore upon the
senses of the Federal host.The forces of the Northern army advanced into the vast no-man's land by
the roads leading from the fords.In the afternoon, Hancock was resting at
Chancellorsville, while Warren posted his corps near the Wilderness
Tavern, in which General Grant established his headquarters.Sedgwick's
corps had followed in the track of Warren's veterans, but was ordered to
halt near the river crossing, or a little south of it.The cavalry, as
much as was not covering the rear wagon trains, was stationed near
Chancellorsville and the Wilderness Tavern.That night the men from the
North lay in bivouac with little fear of being attacked in this wilderness
of waste, where military maneuvers would be very difficult.Two roads--the old Orange turnpike and the Orange plank road--enter the
Wilderness from the southwest.Along these the Confederates moved from
their entrenched position to oppose the advancing hosts of the North.Ewell took the old turnpike and Hill the plank road.Longstreet was
hastening from Gordonsville.The troops of Longstreet, on the one side,
and of Burnside, on the other, arrived on the field after exhausting
forced marches.The locality in which the Federal army found itself on the 5th of May was
not one that any commander would choose for a battle-ground.Lee was more
familiar with its terrible features than was his opponent, but this gave
him little or no advantage.Grant, having decided to move by the
Confederate right flank, could only hope to pass through the desolate
region and reach more open country before the inevitable clash would come.General Humphreys, who was Meade's chief of staff,
says in his "Virginia Campaign of 1864 and 1865": "So far as I know, no
great battle ever took place before on such ground.But little of the
combatants could be seen, and its progress was known to the senses chiefly
by the rising and falling sounds of a vast musketry fire that continually
swept along the lines of battle, many miles in length, sounds which at
times approached to the sublime."As Ewell, moving along the old turnpike on the morning of May 5th, came
near the Germanna Ford road, Warren's corps was marching down the latter
on its way to Parker's store, the destination assigned it by the orders of
the day.This meeting precipitated the battle of the Wilderness.Meade learned the position of Ewell's advance division and ordered an
attack.The Confederates were driven back a mile or two, but, re-forming
and reenforced, the tide of battle was turned the other way.Sedgwick's
marching orders were sending him to the Wilderness Tavern on the turnpike.He was on his way when the battle began, and he now turned to the right
from the Germanna Ford road and formed several of his divisions on
Warren's right.The presence of Hill on the plank road became known to
Meade and Grant, about eight in the morning.Hancock, at Chancellorsville,
was too far away to check him, so Getty's division of Sedgwick's corps, on
its way to the right, was sent over the Brock road to its junction with
the plank road for the purpose of driving Hill back, if possible, beyond
Parker's store.Warren and Sedgwick began to entrench themselves when they realized that
Ewell had effectively blocked their progress.Getty, at the junction of
the Brock and the Orange plank roads, was likewise throwing up breastworks
as fast as he could.Hancock, coming down the Brock road from
Chancellorsville, reached him at two in the afternoon and found two of A.
P. Hill's divisions in front.After waiting to finish his breastworks,
Getty, a little after four o'clock, started, with Hancock supporting him,
to carry out his orders to drive Hill back.Hancock says: "The fighting
became very fierce at once.The lines of battle were exceedingly close,
the musketry continuous and deadly along the entire line.... The battle
raged with great severity and obstinacy until about 8 P.M.Here, on the Federal left, and in this
desperate engagement, General Alexander Hays, one of Hancock's brigade
commanders, was shot through the head and killed.The afternoon had worn away with heavy skirmishing on the right.About
five o'clock Meade made another attempt on Ewell's forces.Both lines were
well entrenched, but the Confederate artillery enfiladed the Federal
positions.It was after dark when General Seymour of Sedgwick's corps
finally withdrew his brigade, with heavy loss in killed and wounded.When the battle roar had ceased, the rank and file of the Confederate
soldiers learned with sorrow of the death of one of the most dashing
brigade leaders in Ewell's corps, General John M. Jones.This fighting was
the preliminary struggle for position in the formation of the battle-lines
of the two armies, to secure the final hold for the death grapple.The
contestants were without advantage on either side when the sanguinary
day's work was finished.Both armies had constructed breastworks and were entrenched very close to
each other, front to front, gathered and poised for a deadly spring.Early
on the morning of May 6th Hancock was reenforced by Burnside, and Hill by
Longstreet.Grant issued orders, through Meade, for a general attack by Sedgwick,
Warren, and Hancock along the entire line, at five o'clock on the morning
of the 6th.Fifteen minutes before five the Confederates opened fire on
Sedgwick's right, and soon the battle was raging along the whole five-mile
front.It became a hand-to-hand contest.The Federals advanced with great
difficulty.The combatants came upon each other but a few paces apart.Soldiers on one side became hopelessly mixed with those of the other.Artillery played but little part in the battle of the Wilderness.The
cavalry of the two armies had one indecisive engagement on the 5th.The
next day both Custer and Gregg repulsed Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee in two
separate encounters, but Sheridan was unable to follow up the advantage.He had been entrusted with the care of the wagon trains and dared not take
his cavalry too far from them.The battle was chiefly one of musketry.Volley upon volley was poured out unceasingly; screaming bullets mingled
with terrific yells in the dense woods.The noise became deafening, and
the wounded and dying lying on the ground among the trees made a scene of
indescribable horror.Living men rushed in to take the places of those
who had fallen.The missiles cut branches from the trees, and saplings
were mowed down as grass in a meadow is cut by a scythe.Bloody remnants
of uniforms, blue and gray, hung as weird and uncanny decorations from
remaining branches.The story of the Federal right during the morning is easily told.Persistently and often as he tried, Warren could make no impression on the
strongly entrenched Ewell--nor could Sedgwick, who was trying equally hard
with Wright's division of his corps.But with Hancock on the left, in his
entrenchments on the Brock road, it was different.The gallant and heroic
charges here have elicited praise and admiration from friend and foe
alike.At first, Hill was forced back in disorder, and driven in confusion
a mile and a half from his line.The Confederates seemed on the verge of
panic and rout.From the rear of the troops in gray came the beloved
leader of the Southern host, General Lee.He was astride his favorite
battle-horse, and his face was set in lines of determination.Though the
crisis of the battle for the Confederates had arrived, Lee's voice was
calm and soft as he commanded, "Follow me," and then urged his charger
toward the bristling front of the Federal lines.The Confederate ranks
were electrified by the brave example of their commander.A ragged veteran
who had followed Lee through many campaigns, leaped forward and caught the
bridle-rein of the horse."We won't go on until you go back," cried the
devoted warrior.Instantly the Confederate ranks resounded with the cry,
"Lee to the rear!and the great general went back to
safety while his soldiers again took up the gage of battle and plunged
into the smoke and death-laden storm.But Lee, by his personal presence,
and the arrival of Longstreet, had restored order and courage in the
ranks, and their original position was soon regained.The pursuit of the Confederates through the dense forest had caused
confusion and disorganization in Hancock's corps.That cohesion and
strength in a battle-line of soldiers, where the men can "feel the touch,"
shoulder to shoulder, was wanting, and the usual form and regular
alignment was broken.It was two hours before the lines were re-formed.That short time had been well utilized by the Confederates.Gregg's eight
hundred Texans made a desperate charge through the thicket of the pine
against Webb's brigade of Hancock's corps, cutting through the growth, and
wildly shouting amid the crash and roar of the battle.Half of their
number were left on the field, but the blow had effectually checked the
Federal advance.While the battle was raging Grant's general demeanor was imperturbable.He
remained with Meade nearly the whole day at headquarters at the Lacy
house.He sat upon a stump most of the time, or at the foot of a tree,
leaning against its trunk, whittling sticks with his pocket-knife and
smoking big black cigars--twenty during the day.He received reports of
the progress of the battle and gave orders without the least evidence of
excitement or emotion."His orders," said one of his staff, "were given
with a spur," implying instant action.On one occasion, when an officer,
in great excitement, brought him the report of Hancock's misfortune and
expressed apprehension as to Lee's purpose, Grant exclaimed with some
warmth: "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing what Lee is going to do.Go
back to your command and try to think what we are going to do ourselves."Several brigades of Longstreet's troops, though weary from their forced
march, were sent on a flanking movement against Hancock's left, which
demoralized Mott's division and caused it to fall back three-quarters of a
mile.Longstreet now advanced with the rest of his corps.The dashing
leader, while riding with Generals Kershaw and Jenkins at the head of
Jenkins' brigade on the right of the Southern battle array, was screened
by the tangled thickets from the view of his own troops, flushed with the
success of brilliant flank movement.Suddenly the passing column was seen
indistinctly through an opening and a volley burst forth and struck the
officers.When the smoke lifted Longstreet and Jenkins were down--the
former seriously wounded, and the latter killed outright.As at
Chancellorsville a year before and on the same battle-ground, a great
captain of the Confederacy was shot down by his own men, and by accident,
at the crisis of a battle.Jackson lingered several days after
Chancellorsville, while Longstreet recovered and lived to fight for the
Confederacy till the surrender at Appomattox.General Wadsworth, of
Hancock's corps, was mortally wounded during the day, while making a
daring assault on the Confederate works, at the head of his men.During the afternoon, the Confederate attack upon Hancock's and Burnside's
forces, which constituted nearly half the entire army, was so severe that
the Federal lines began to give way.The combatants swayed back and forth;
the Confederates seized the Federal breastworks repeatedly, only to be
repulsed again and again.Once, the Southern colors were placed on the
Union battlements.A fire in the forest, which had been burning for hours,
and in which, it is estimated, about two hundred of the Federal wounded
perished, was communicated to the timber entrenchments, the heat and smoke
driving into the faces of the men on the Union side, and compelling them
in some places to abandon the works.Hancock made a gallant and heroic
effort to re-form his lines and push the attack, and, as he rode along the
lines, his inspiring presence elicited cheer upon cheer from the men, but
the troops had exhausted their ammunition, the wagons were in the rear,
and as night was approaching, further attack was abandoned.The contest
ended on the lines where it began.Later in the evening consternation swept the Federal camp when heavy
firing was heard in the direction of Sedgwick's corps, on the right.The
report was current that the entire Sixth Corps had been attacked and
broken.What had happened was a surprise attack by the Confederates,
commanded by General John B. Gordon, on Sedgwick's right flank, Generals
Seymour and Shaler with six hundred men being captured.When a message was
received from Sedgwick that the Sixth Corps was safe in an entirely new
line, there was great rejoicing in the Union camp.Thus ended the two days' fighting of the battle of the Wilderness, one of
the greatest struggles in history.It was Grant's first experience in the
East, and his trial measure of arms with his great antagonist, General
Lee.The latter returned to his entrenchments and the Federals remained in
their position.While Grant had been
defeated in his plan to pass around Lee, yet he had made a new record for
the Army of the Potomac, and he was not turned from his purpose of putting
himself between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.During the two days' engagement, there were ten hours of
actual fighting, with a loss in killed and wounded of about seventeen
thousand Union and nearly twelve thousand Confederates, nearly three
thousand men sacrificed each hour.It is the belief of some military
writers that Lee deliberately chose the Wilderness as a battle-ground, as
it would effectually conceal great inferiority of force, but if this be so
he seems to have come to share the unanimous opinions of the generals of
both sides that its difficulties were unsurmountable, and within his
entrenchments he awaited further attack.The next night, May 7th, Grant's march by the Confederate right flank was
resumed, but only to be blocked again by the dogged determination of the
tenacious antagonist, a few miles beyond, at Spotsylvania.It is not strange that the minds of these two
men moved along the same lines in military strategy, when we remember they
were both military experts of the highest order, and were now working out
the same problem.The results obtained by each are told in the story of
the battle of Spotsylvania.[Illustration: LEE'S MEN]

The faces of the veterans in this photograph of 1864 reflect more forcibly
than volumes of historical essays, the privations and the courage of the
ragged veterans in gray who faced Grant, with Lee as their leader.They
did not know that their struggle had already become unavailing; that no
amount of perseverance and devotion could make headway against the
resources, determination, and discipline of the Northern armies, now that
they had become concentrated and wielded by a master of men like Grant.But Grant was as yet little more than a name to the armies of the East.His successes had been won on Western fields--Donelson, Vicksburg,
Chattanooga.It was not yet known that the Army of the Potomac under the
new general-in-chief was to prove irresistible.[Illustration: CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS IN VIRGINIA, 1864

captures during May and June, when he sent some ten thousand Confederates
to Coxey's Landing, Virginia, as a result of his first stroke against
Lee--though their arms have been taken from them, though their uniforms
are anything but "uniform," their hats partly the regulation felt of the
Army of Northern Virginia, partly captured Federal caps, and partly
nondescript--yet these ragged veterans stand and sit with the dignity of
accomplishment.To them, "Marse Robert" is still the general
unconquerable, under whom inferior numbers again and again have held their
own, and more; the brilliant leader under whom every man gladly rushes to
any assault, however impossible it seems, knowing that every order will be
made to count.[Illustration: THE COMING OF THE STRANGER GRANT

1864.The day before, in Washington, President Lincoln handed him his
commission, appointing him Lieutenant-General in command of all the
Federal forces.His visit to Washington convinced him of the wisdom of
remaining in the East to direct affairs, and his first interview with
Meade decided him to retain that efficient general in command of the Army
of the Potomac.The two men had known each other but slightly from casual
meetings during the Mexican War."I was a stranger to most of the Army of
the Potomac," said Grant, "but Meade's modesty and willingness to serve in
any capacity impressed me even more than had his victory at Gettysburg."The only prominent officers Grant brought on from the West were Sheridan
and Rawlins.[Illustration: SIGNALING ORDERS FROM GENERAL MEADE'S HEADQUARTERS, JUST
BEFORE THE WILDERNESS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In April, 1864, General Meade's headquarters lay north of the Rapidan.The
Signal Corps was kept busy transmitting the orders preliminary to the
Wilderness campaign, which was to begin May 5th.The headquarters are
below the brow of the hill.A most important part of the Signal Corps'
duty was the interception and translation of messages interchanged between
the Confederate signal-men.A veteran of Sheridan's army tells of his
impressions as follows: "On the evening of the 18th of October, 1864, the
soldiers of Sheridan's army lay in their lines at Cedar Creek.Our
attention was suddenly directed to the ridge of Massanutten, or Three Top

Corps.A lively series of signals was being flashed out from the peak, and
it was evident that messages were being sent both eastward and westward of
the ridge.I can recall now the feeling with which we looked up at those
flashes going over our heads, knowing that they must be Confederate
messages.It was only later that we learned that a keen-eyed Union officer
had been able to read the message: 'To Lieutenant-General Early.Be ready
to move as soon as my forces join you, and we will crush Sheridan.The sturdiness of Sheridan's veterans and
the fresh spirit put into the hearts of the men by the return of Sheridan
himself from 'Winchester, twenty miles away,' a ride rendered immortal by
Read's poem, proved too much at last for the pluck and persistency of
Early's worn-out troops."[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO THE FRONT

the Army of the Potomac awoke to the activity of the spring campaign.One
of the first essentials was to get the vast transport trains in readiness
to cross the Rapidan.Wagons were massed by thousands at Culpeper, near
where Meade's troops had spent the winter.The work of the teamsters was
most arduous; wearied by long night marches--nodding, reins in hand, for
lack of sleep--they might at any moment be suddenly attacked in a bold
attempt to capture or destroy their precious freight.When the
arrangements were completed, each wagon bore the corps badge, division
color, and number of the brigade it was to serve.Its contents were also
designated, together with the branch of the service for which it was
intended.While loaded, the wagons must keep pace with the army movements
whenever possible in order to be parked at night near the brigades to
which they belonged.[Illustration: THE "GRAND CAMPAIGN" UNDER WAY--THE DAY BEFORE THE BATTLE

the army, with the exception of Burnside's Ninth Corps, was south of the
Rapidan, advancing into the Wilderness.The Ninth Corps (a reserve of
twenty thousand men) remained temporarily north of the Rappahannock,
guarding railway communications.On the wooden pontoon-bridge the
rear-guard is crossing while the pontonniers are taking up the canvas

to be a complete surprise, as Lee had offered no opposition.In the baffling fighting of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court
House, Grant was to lose a third of his superior number, arriving a month
later on the James with a dispirited army that had left behind 54,926
comrades in a month.[Illustration: THE TANGLED BATTLEFIELD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The Edge of the Wilderness, May 5, 1864.Stretching away to the westward
between Grant's army and Lee's lay no-man's-land--the Wilderness.Covered
with a second-growth of thicket, thorny underbrush, and twisted vines, it
was an almost impassable labyrinth, with here and there small clearings in
which stood deserted barns and houses, reached only by unused and
overgrown farm roads.The Federal advance into this region was not a
surprise to Lee, as Grant supposed.The Confederate commander had caused
the region to be carefully surveyed, hoping for the precise opportunity
that Grant was about to give him.At the very outset of the campaign he
could strike the Federals in a position where superior numbers counted
little.If he could drive Grant beyond the Rappahannock--as he had forced
Pope, Burnside and Hooker before him--says George Cary Eggleston (in the
"History of the Confederate War"), "loud and almost irresistible would
have been the cry for an armistice, supported (as it would have been) by
Wall Street and all Europe."[Illustration: WHERE EWELL'S CHARGE SURPRISED GRANT

before, while they fought in the Wilderness, May 5, 1864.In the picture
we see some of the customary breastworks which both contending armies
threw up to strengthen their positions.These were in a field near the
turnpike in front of Ewell's main line.The impracticable nature of the
ground tore the lines on both sides into fragments; as they swept back and
forth, squads and companies strove fiercely with one another,
hand-to-hand.Grant had confidently expressed the belief to one of his
staff officers that there was no more advance left in Lee's army.He was
surprised to learn on the 5th that Ewell's Corps was marching rapidly down
the Orange turnpike to strike at Sedgwick and Warren, while A. P. Hill,
with Longstreet close behind, was pushing forward on the Orange plank-road
against Hancock.LEE GIVES BLOW FOR BLOW

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Another view of Ewell's advanced entrenchments--the bark still fresh where
the Confederates had worked with the logs.In the Wilderness, Lee, ever
bold and aggressive, executed one of the most brilliant maneuvers of his
career.His advance was a sudden surprise for Grant, and the manner in
which he gave battle was another.Grant harbored the notion that his
adversary would act on the defensive, and that there would be opportunity
to attack the Army of Northern Virginia only behind strong entrenchments.But in the Wilderness, Lee's veterans, the backbone of the South's
fighting strength, showed again their unquenchable spirit of
aggressiveness.They came forth to meet Grant's men on equal terms in the
thorny thickets.About noon, May 5th, the stillness was broken by the
rattle of musketry and the roar of artillery, which told that Warren had
met with resistance on the turnpike and that the battle had begun.Nearly
a mile were Ewell's men driven back, and then they came magnificently on
again, fighting furiously in the smoke-filled thickets with Warren's now
retreating troops.Sedgwick, coming to the support of Warren, renewed the
conflict.To the southward on the plank road, Getty's division, of the
Sixth Corps, hard pressed by the forces of A. P. Hill, was succored by
Hancock with the Second Corps, and together these commanders achieved what
seemed success.It was brief; Longstreet was close at hand to save the day
for the Confederates.TREES IN THE TRACK OF THE IRON STORM

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The Wilderness to the north of the Orange turnpike.Over ground like this,
where men had seldom trod before, ebbed and flowed the tide of trampling
thousands on May 5 and 6, 1864.Artillery, of which Grant had a
superabundance, was well-nigh useless, wreaking its impotent fury upon the
defenseless trees.Even the efficacy of musketry fire was hampered.Men
tripping and falling in the tangled underbrush arose bleeding from the
briars to struggle with an adversary whose every movement was impeded
also.The cold steel of the bayonet finished the work which rifles had
begun.In the terrible turmoil of death the hopes of both Grant and Lee
were doomed to disappointment.Lee,
disregarding his own safety, endeavored to rally the disordered ranks of
A. P. Hill, and could only be persuaded to retire by the pledge of
Longstreet that his advancing force would win the coveted victory.Falling
upon Hancock's flank, the fresh troops seemed about to crush the Second
Corps, as Jackson's men had crushed the Eleventh the previous year at
Chancellorsville.But now, as Jackson, at the critical moment, had fallen
by the fire of his own men, so Longstreet and his staff, galloping along
the plank road, were mistaken by their own soldiers for Federals and fired
upon.A minie-ball struck Longstreet in the shoulder, and he was carried
from the field, feebly waving his hat that his men might know that he was
not killed.With him departed from the field the life of the attack.[Illustration: A LOSS IN "EFFECTIVE STRENGTH"--WOUNDED AT FREDERICKSBURG

perished in the horror of a forest fire on the night of May 5th.The
Federals lost many gallant officers, among them the veteran Wadsworth.The
Confederates lost Generals Jenkins and Jones, killed, and suffered a
staggering blow in the disabling of Longstreet.The series of battles of
the Wilderness and Spotsylvania campaigns were more costly to the Federals
than Antietam and Gettysburg combined.[Illustration: ONE OF GRANT'S FIELD-TELEGRAPH STATIONS IN 1864

excellent idea of the difficulties under which telegraphing was done at

for a table, the resourceful operator mounted his "relay," tested his
wire, and brought the commanding general into direct communication with
separated brigades or divisions.The U. S. Military Telegraph Corps,
through its Superintendent of Construction, Dennis Doren, kept Meade and
both wings of his army in communication from the crossing of the Rapidan
in May, 1864, till the siege of Petersburg.Over this field-line Grant
received daily reports from four separate armies, numbering a quarter of a
million men, and replied with daily directions for their operations over
an area of seven hundred and fifty thousand square miles.Though every
corps of Meade's army moved daily, Doren kept them in touch with
headquarters.The field-line was built of seven twisted, rubber-coated
wires which were hastily strung on trees or fences.TELEGRAPHING FOR THE ARMIES

The man who established the Federal military telegraph system amid the
first horrors of war was to become one of the world's foremost advocates
of peace.As the right hand man of Thomas A. Scott, Assistant Secretary of
War, he came to Washington in '61, and was immediately put in charge of
the field work of reestablishing communication between the Capital and the
North, cut off by the Maryland mobs.A telegraph operator himself, he
inaugurated the system of cipher despatches for the War Department and
secured the trusted operators with whom the service was begun.A young man
of twenty-four at the time, he was one of the last to leave the
battlefield of Bull Run, and his duties of general superintendence over
the network of railroads and telegraph lines made him a witness of war's
cruelties on other fields until he with his chief left the government
service June 1, 1862.THE MILITARY FIELD TELEGRAPH

"No orders ever had to be given to establish the telegraph."Thus wrote
General Grant in his memoirs."The moment troops were in position to go
into camp, the men would put up their wires."Grant pays a glowing tribute
to "the organization and discipline of this body of brave and intelligent
men."[Illustration: THE ARMY SAVING THE NAVY IN MAY, 1864

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration]

Here the army is saving the navy by a brilliant piece of engineering that
prevented the loss of a fleet worth $2,000,000.The Red River expedition
was one of the most humiliating ever undertaken by the Federals.Porter's
fleet, which had so boldly advanced above the falls at Alexandria, was
ordered back, only to find that the river was so low as to imprison twelve
vessels.Lieut.-Colonel Joseph Bailey, acting engineer of the Nineteenth
Corps, obtained permission to build a dam in order to make possible the
passage of the fleet.Begun on April 30, 1864, the work was finished on
the 8th of May, almost entirely by the soldiers, working incessantly day
and night, often up to their necks in water and under the broiling sun.Bailey succeeded in turning the whole current into one channel and the
squadron passed below to safety.Not often have inland lumbermen been the
means of saving a navy.[Illustration: COLONEL JOSEPH BAILEY IN 1864.THE MAN WHO SAVED THE FLEET.]The army engineers laughed at this wide-browed, unassuming man when he
suggested building a dam so as to release Admiral Porter's fleet
imprisoned by low water above the Falls at Alexandria at the close of the
futile Red River expedition in 1864.Bailey had been a lumberman in
Wisconsin and had there gained the practical experience which taught him
that the plan was feasible.He was Acting Chief Engineer of the Nineteenth
Army Corps at this time, and obtained permission to go ahead and build his
dam.In the undertaking he had the approval and earnest support of Admiral
Porter, who refused to consider for a moment the abandonment of any of his
vessels even though the Red River expedition had been ordered to return
and General Banks was chafing at delay and sending messages to Porter that
his troops must be got in motion at once.Bailey pushed on with his work and in eleven days he succeeded in so
raising the water in the channel that all the Federal vessels were able to
pass down below the Falls."Words are inadequate," said Admiral Porter, in
his report, "to express the admiration I feel for the ability of Lieut.This is without doubt the best engineering feat ever
performed.... The highest honors the Government can bestow on Colonel
Bailey can never repay him for the service he has rendered the country."For this achievement Bailey was promoted to colonel, brevetted brigadier
general, voted the thanks of Congress, and presented with a sword and a
purse of $3,000 by the officers of Porter's fleet.He settled in Missouri
after the war and was a formidable enemy of the "Bushwhackers" till he was
shot by them on March 21, 1867.He was born at Salem, Ohio, April 28,
1827.[Illustration: READY FOR HER BAPTISM.COPYRIGHT BY REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Mary travelled to the garden.This powerful gunboat, the _Lafayette_, though accompanying Admiral Porter
on the Red River expedition, was not one of those entrapped at Alexandria.Her heavy draft precluded her being taken above the Falls.Here we see her
lying above Vicksburg in the spring of 1863.She and her sister ship, the
_Choctaw_, were side-wheel steamers altered into casemate ironclads with
rams.The _Lafayette_ had the stronger armament, carrying two 11-inch
Dahlgrens forward, four 9-inch guns in the broadside, and two 24-pound
howitzers, with two 100-pound Parrott guns astern.She and the _Choctaw_
were the most important acquisitions to Porter's fleet toward the end of
1862.The _Lafayette_ was built and armed for heavy fighting.She got her
first taste of it on the night of April 16, 1863, when Porter took part of
his fleet past the Vicksburg batteries to support Grant's crossing of the
river in an advance on Vicksburg from below.The Lafayette, with a barge
and a transport lashed to her, held her course with difficulty through the
tornado of shot and shell which poured from the Confederate batteries on
the river front in Vicksburg as soon as the movement was discovered.The
_Lafayette_ stood up to this fiery christening and successfully ran the
gantlet, as did all the other vessels save one transport.She was
commanded during the Red River expedition by Lieutenant-Commander J. P.
Foster.[Illustration: FARRAGUT AT THE PINNACLE OF HIS FAME

the southward he was regarded as utterly foolhardy.All that was needed,
however, to make Fox's plan successful was the man with spirit enough to
undertake it and judgment sufficient to carry it out.Here on the deck of
the fine new sloop-of-war that had been assigned to him as flagship,
stands the man who had just accomplished a greater feat that made him a
world figure as famous as Nelson.The Confederacy had found its great
general among its own people, but the great admiral of the war, although
of Southern birth, had refused to fight against the flag for which, as a
boy in the War of 1812, he had seen men die.Full of the fighting spirit
of the old navy, he was able to achieve the first great victory that gave
new hope to the Federal cause.Percival Drayton was also a Southerner, a
South Carolinian, whose brothers and uncles were fighting for the South.[Illustration: "FAR BY GRAY MORGAN'S WALLS"--THE MOBILE BAY FORT, BATTERED
BY FARRAGUT'S GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]How formidable was Farragut's undertaking in forcing his way into Mobile
Bay is apparent from these photographs.For wooden vessels to pass Morgan
and Gaines, two of the strongest forts on the coast, was pronounced by
experts most foolhardy.Besides, the channel was planted with torpedoes
that might blow the ships to atoms, and within the bay was the Confederate
ram _Tennessee_, thought to be the most powerful ironclad ever put afloat.In the arrangements for the attack, Farragut's flagship, the _Hartford_,
was placed second, the _Brooklyn_ leading the line of battleships, which
were preceded by four monitors.At a quarter before six, on the morning of
August 5th, the fleet moved.Half an hour later it came within range of
Fort Morgan.The
monitor _Tecumseh_, eager to engage the Confederate ram _Tennessee_ behind
the line of torpedoes, ran straight ahead, struck a torpedo, and in a few
minutes went down with most of the crew.As the monitor sank, the
_Brooklyn_ recoiled.Farragut signaled: "What's the trouble?""Torpedoes,"
was the answer."Go ahead, Captain
Drayton.Finding that the smoke from the guns obstructed the
view from the deck, Farragut ascended to the rigging of the main mast,
where he was in great danger of being struck and of falling to the deck.The captain accordingly ordered a quartermaster to tie him in the shrouds.The _Hartford_, under a full head of steam, rushed over the torpedo ground
far in advance of the fleet.The Confederate
ram, invulnerable to the broadsides of the Union guns, steamed alone for
the ships, while the ramparts of the two forts were crowded with
spectators of the coming conflict.The ironclad monster made straight for
the flagship, attempting to ram it and paying no attention to the fire or
the ramming of the other vessels.Its first effort was unsuccessful, but a
second came near proving fatal.It then became a target for the whole
Union fleet; finally its rudder-chain was shot away and it became
unmanageable; in a few minutes it raised the white flag.No wonder
Americans call Farragut the greatest of naval commanders.[Illustration: WHERE BROADSIDES STRUCK]

she steamed in line to the attack of Fort Morgan at Mobile Bay on the
morning of August 5, 1864.Every man was at his station thinking his own
thoughts in the suspense of that moment.On the quarterdeck stood Captain
Percival Drayton and his staff.Near them was the chief-quartermaster,
John H. Knowles, ready to hoist the signals that would convey Farragut's
orders to the fleet.The admiral himself was in the port main shrouds
twenty-five feet above the deck.All was silence aboard till the
"Hartford" was in easy range of the fort.Then the great broadsides of the
old ship began to take their part in the awful cannonade.During the early
part of the action Captain Drayton, fearing that some damage to the
rigging might pitch Farragut overboard, sent Knowles on his famous
mission."I went up," said the old sailor, "with a piece of lead line and
made it fast to one of the forward shrouds, and then took it around the
admiral to the after shroud, making it fast there.The admiral said,
'Never mind, I'm all right,' but I went ahead and obeyed orders."Later
Farragut, undoing the lashing with his own hands, climbed higher still.[Illustration: QUARTERMASTER KNOWLES]

amazing courage and skill; the rapidity and accuracy of their fire was
rarely equalled in the war.In the terrible conflict the "Hartford" was
struck twenty times, the "Brooklyn" thirty, the "Octorora" seventeen, the
"Metacomet" eleven, the "Lackawanna" five, the "Ossipee" four, the
"Monongahela" five, the "Kennebec" two, and the "Galena" seven.Of the
monitors the "Chickasaw" was struck three times, the "Manhattan" nine, and
the "Winnebago" nineteen.The total loss in the Federal fleet was 52
killed and 170 wounded, while on the Confederate gunboats 12 were killed
and 20 wounded.The night after the battle the "Metacomet" was turned into
a hospital ship and the wounded of both sides were taken to Pensacola.The
pilot of the captured "Tennessee" guided the Federal ship through the
torpedoes, and as she was leaving Pensacola on her return trip Midshipman
Carter of the "Tennessee," who also was on the "Metacomet," called out
from the wharf: "Don't attempt to fire No.2 gun (of the "Tennessee"), as
there is a shell jammed in the bore, and the gun will burst and kill some
one."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: THE BRAVEST OF THE BRAVE--THE CONFEDERATE IRONCLAD RAM
"TENNESSEE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Mobile Bay, on the morning of August 5, 1864, was the arena of more
conspicuous heroism than marked any naval battle-ground of the entire war.Among all the daring deeds of that day stands out superlatively the
gallant manner in which Admiral Franklin Buchanan, C. S. N., fought his
vessel, the "Tennessee.""You shall not have it to say when you leave this
vessel that you were not near enough to the enemy, for I will meet them,
and then you can fight them alongside of their own ships; and if I fall,
lay me on one side and go on with the fight."Thus Buchanan addressed his
men, and then, taking his station in the pilot-house, he took his vessel
into action.The Federal fleet carried more power for destruction than the
combined English, French, and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar, and yet
Buchanan made good his boast that he would fight alongside.No sooner had
Farragut crossed the torpedoes than Buchanan matched that deed, running
through the entire line of Federal vessels, braving their broadsides, and
coming to close quarters with most of them.Then the "Tennessee" ran under
the guns of Fort Morgan for a breathing space.In half an hour she was
steaming up the bay to fight the entire squadron single-handed.Such
boldness was scarce believable, for Buchanan had now not alone wooden
ships to contend with, as when in the "Merrimac" he had dismayed the
Federals in Hampton Roads.Three powerful monitors were to oppose him at
point-blank range.For nearly an hour the gunners in the "Tennessee"
fought, breathing powder-smoke amid an atmosphere superheated to 120
degrees.Buchanan was serving a gun himself when he was wounded and
carried to the surgeon's table below.Captain Johnston fought on for
another twenty minutes, and then the "Tennessee," with her rudder and
engines useless and unable to fire a gun, was surrendered, after a
reluctant consent had been wrung from Buchanan, as he lay on the operating
table.[Illustration]

  _Copyright, 1901, by Perrien-Keydel Co.,
  Detroit, Mich., U. S. A._]




THE BATTLE OF SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE

    But to Spotsylvania history will accord the palm, I am sure, for
    having furnished an unexampled muzzle-to-muzzle fire; the longest roll
    of incessant, unbroken musketry; the most splendid exhibition of
    individual heroism and personal daring by large numbers, who, standing
    in the freshly spilt blood of their fellows, faced for so long a
    period and at so short a range the flaming rifles as they heralded the
    decrees of death.It was
    exhibited by both armies, and in that hand-to-hand struggle for the
    possession of the breastworks it seemed almost universal.It would be
    commonplace truism to say that such examples will not be lost to the
    Republic.--_General John B. Gordon, C. S. A., in "Reminiscences of the
    Civil War."_


Immediately after the cessation of hostilities on the 6th of May in the
Wilderness, Grant determined to move his army to Spotsylvania Court House,
and to start the wagon trains on the afternoon of the 7th.Grant's object
was, by a flank move, to get between Lee and Richmond.Lee foresaw Grant's
purpose and also moved his cavalry, under Stuart, across the opponent's
path.As an illustration of the exact science of war we see the two great
military leaders racing for position at Spotsylvania Court House.It was
revealed later that Lee had already made preparations on this field a year
before, in anticipation of its being a possible battle-ground.Apprised of the movement of the Federal trains, Lee, with his usual
sagacious foresight, surmised their destination.He therefore ordered
General R. H. Anderson, now in command of Longstreet's corps, to march to
Spotsylvania Court House at three o'clock on the morning of the 8th.But
the smoke and flames from the burning forests that surrounded Anderson's
camp in the Wilderness made the position untenable, and the march was
begun at eleven o'clock on the night of the 7th.This early start proved
of inestimable value to the Confederates.Anderson's right, in the
Wilderness, rested opposite Hancock's left, and the Confederates secured a
more direct line of march to Spotsylvania, several miles shorter than that
of the Federals.The same night General Ewell at the extreme Confederate
left was ordered to follow Anderson at daylight, if he found no large
force in his front.This order was followed out, there being no opposing
troops, and the corps took the longest route of any of Lee's troops.General Ewell found the march exhausting and distressing on account of the
intense heat and dust and smoke from the burning forests.The Federal move toward Spotsylvania Court House was begun after dark on
the 7th.Warren's corps, in the lead, took the Brock road behind Hancock's
position and was followed by Sedgwick, who marched by way of
Chancellorsville.Burnside came next, but he was halted to guard the
trains.Hancock, covering the move, did not start the head of his command
until some time after daylight.When Warren reached Todd's Tavern he found
the Union cavalry under Merritt in conflict with Fitzhugh Lee's division
of Stuart's cavalry.Warren sent Robinson's division ahead; it drove
Fitzhugh Lee back, and, advancing rapidly, met the head of Anderson's
troops.The leading brigades came to the assistance of the cavalry; Warren
was finally repulsed and began entrenching.The Confederates gained
Spotsylvania Court House.Throughout the day there was continual skirmishing between the troops, as
the Northerners attempted to break the line of the Confederates.Every advance of the blue was repulsed.Lee again
blocked the way of Grant's move.The Federal loss during the day had been
about thirteen hundred, while the Confederates lost fewer men than their
opponents.The work of both was now the construction of entrenchments, which
consisted of earthworks sloping to either side, with logs as a parapet,
and between these works and the opposing army were constructed what are
known as abatis, felled trees, with the branches cut off, the sharp ends
projecting toward the approaching forces.Lee's entrenchments were of such character as to increase the efficiency
of his force.They were formed in the shape of a huge V with the apex
flattened, forming a salient angle against the center of the Federal line.The Confederate lines were facing north, northwest, and northeast, the
corps commanded by Anderson on the left, Ewell in the center, and Early on
the right, the latter temporarily replacing A. P. Hill, who was ill.The
Federals confronting them were Burnside on the left, Sedgwick and Warren
in the center, and Hancock on the right.The day of the 9th was spent in placing the lines of troops, with no
fighting except skirmishing and some sharp-shooting.While placing some
field-pieces, General Sedgwick was hit by a sharpshooter's bullet and
instantly killed.He was a man of high character, a most competent
commander, of fearless courage, loved and lamented by the army.General
Horatio G. Wright succeeded to the command of the Sixth Corps.Early on the morning of the 10th, the Confederates discovered that Hancock
had crossed the Po River in front of his position of the day before and
was threatening their rear.Grant had suspected that Lee was about to move
north toward Fredericksburg, and Hancock had been ordered to make a
reconnaissance with a view to attacking and turning the Confederate left.But difficulties stood in the way of Hancock's performance, and before he
had accomplished much, Meade directed him to send two of his divisions to
assist Warren in making an attack on the Southern lines.The Second Corps
started to recross the Po.Before all were over Early made a vigorous
assault on the rear division, which did not escape without heavy loss.In
this engagement the corps lost the first gun in its most honorable career,
a misfortune deeply lamented by every man in the corps, since up to this
moment it had long been the only one in the entire army which could make
the proud claim of never having lost a gun or a color.But the great event of the 10th was the direct assault upon the
Confederate front.Meade had arranged for Hancock to take charge of this,
and the appointed hour was five in the afternoon.But Warren reported
earlier that the opportunity was most favorable, and he was ordered to
start at once.Wearing his full uniform, the leader of the Fifth Corps
advanced at a quarter to four with the greater portion of his troops.The
progress of the valiant Northerners was one of the greatest difficulty,
owing to the dense wood of low cedar-trees through which they had to make
their way.Longstreet's corps behind their entrenchments acknowledged the
advance with very heavy artillery and musket fire.But Warren's troops did
not falter or pause until some had reached the abatis and others the very
crest of the parapet.A few, indeed, were actually killed inside the
works.All, however, who survived the terrible ordeal were finally driven
back with heavy loss.General James C. Rice was mortally wounded.To the left of Warren, General Wright had observed what he believed to be
a vulnerable spot in the Confederate entrenchments.Behind this particular
place was stationed Doles' brigade of Georgia regiments, and Colonel Emory
Upton was ordered to charge Doles with a column of twelve regiments in
four lines.The ceasing of the Federal artillery at six o'clock was the
signal for the charge, and twenty minutes later, as Upton tells us, "at
command, the lines rose, moved noiselessly to the edge of the wood, and
then, with a wild cheer and faces averted, rushed for the works.Through a
terrible front and flank fire the column advanced quickly, gaining the
parapet.Here occurred a deadly hand-to-hand conflict.The enemy, sitting
in their pits with pieces upright, loaded, and with bayonets fixed ready
to impale the first who should leap over, absolutely refused to yield the
ground.The first of our men who tried to surmount the works fell, pierced
through the head by musket-balls.Others, seeing the fate of their
comrades, held their pieces at arm's length and fired downward, while
others, poising their pieces vertically, hurled them down upon their
enemy, pinning them to the ground.... The struggle lasted but a few
seconds.Numbers prevailed, and like a resistless wave, the column poured
over the works, quickly putting _hors de combat_ those who resisted and
sending to the rear those who surrendered.Pressing forward and expanding
to the right and left, the second line of entrenchments, its line of
battle, and a battery fell into our hands.The column of assault had
accomplished its task."The Confederate line had been shattered and an opening made for expected
support.General Mott, on the left, did
not bring his division forward as had been planned and as General Wright
had ordered.The Confederates were reenforced, and Upton could do no more
than hold the captured entrenchments until ordered to retire.He brought
twelve hundred prisoners and several stands of colors back to the Union
lines; but over a thousand of his own men were killed or wounded.For
gallantry displayed in this charge, Colonel Upton was made
brigadier-general.The losses to the Union army in this engagement at Spotsylvania were over
four thousand.The loss to the Confederates was probably two thousand.The two giant antagonists took a
breathing spell.It was on the morning of this date that Grant penned the
sentence, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer,"
to his chief of staff, General Halleck.During this time Sheridan, who had brought the cavalry up to a state of
great efficiency, was making an expedition to the vicinity of Richmond.He
had said that if he were permitted to operate independently of the army he
would draw Stuart after him.Grant at once gave the order, and Sheridan
made a detour around Lee's army, engaging and defeating the Confederate
cavalry, which he greatly outnumbered, on the 11th of May, at Yellow
Tavern, where General Stuart, the brilliant commander of the Confederate
cavalry, was mortally wounded.Grant carefully went over the ground and decided upon another attack on
the 12th.About four hundred yards of clear ground lay in front of the
sharp angle, or salient, of Lee's lines.After the battle this point was
known as the "Bloody Angle," and also as "Hell's Hole."Here Hancock was
ordered to make an attack at daybreak on the 12th.Lee had been expecting
a move on the part of Grant.On the evening of the 10th he sent to Ewell
this message: "It will be necessary for you to reestablish your whole line
to-night.... Perhaps Grant will make a night attack, as it was a favorite
amusement of his at Vicksburg."Through rain and mud Hancock's force was gotten into position within a few
hundred yards of the Confederate breastworks.He was now between Burnside
and Wright.At the first approach of dawn the four divisions of the Second
Corps, under Birney, Mott, Barlow, and Gibbon (in reserve) moved
noiselessly to the designated point of attack.Without a shot being fired
they reached the Confederate entrenchments, and struck with fury and
impetuosity a mortal blow at the point where least expected, on the
salient, held by General Edward Johnson of Ewell's corps.The movement of
the Federals was so swift and the surprise so complete, that the
Confederates could make practically no resistance, and were forced to
surrender.The artillery had been withdrawn from the earthworks occupied by Johnson's
troops on the previous night, but developments had led to an order to
have it returned early in the morning.It was approaching as the attack
was made.Before the artillerymen could escape or turn the guns upon the
Federals, every cannon had been captured.General Johnson with almost his
whole division, numbering about three thousand, and General Steuart, were
captured, between twenty and thirty colors, and several thousand stands of
arms were taken.Hancock had already distinguished himself as a leader of
his soldiers, and from his magnificent appearance, noble bearing, and
courage had been called "Hancock the Superb," but this was the most
brilliant of his military achievements.Pressing onward across the first defensive line of the Confederates,
Hancock's men advanced against the second series of trenches, nearly half
a mile beyond.As the Federals pushed through the muddy fields they lost
all formation.The Southerners
were prepared for the attack.A volley poured into the throng of blue, and
General Gordon with his reserve division rushed forward, fighting
desperately to drive the Northerners back.As they did so General Lee rode
up, evidently intending to go forward with Gordon.His horse was seized by
one of the soldiers, and for the second time in the campaign the cry arose
from the ranks, "Lee to the rear!"The beloved commander was led back from
the range of fire, while the men, under the inspiration of his example,
rushed forward in a charge that drove the Federals back until they had
reached the outer line of works.Here they fought stubbornly at deadly
range.Neither side was able to force the other back.But Gordon was not
able to cope with the entire attack.Wright and Warren both sent some of
their divisions to reenforce Hancock, and Lee sent all the assistance
possible to the troops struggling so desperately to restore his line at
the salient.Many vivid and picturesque descriptions of this fighting at the angle have
been written, some by eye-witnesses, others by able historians, but no
printed page, no cold type can convey to the mind the realities of that
terrible conflict.The whole engagement was
practically a hand-to-hand contest.The dead lay beneath the feet of the
living, three and four layers deep.This hitherto quiet spot of earth was
devastated and covered with the slain, weltering in their own blood,
mangled and shattered into scarcely a semblance of human form.Dying men
were crushed by horses and many, buried beneath the mire and mud, still
lived.Some artillery was posted on high ground not far from the apex of
the salient, and an incessant fire was poured into the Confederate works
over the Union lines, while other guns kept up an enfilade of canister
along the west of the salient.The contest from the right of the Sixth to the left of the Second Corps
was kept up throughout the day along the whole line.Repeatedly the
trenches had to be cleared of the dead.An oak tree twenty-two inches in
diameter was cut down by musket-balls.Men leaped upon the breastworks,
firing until shot down.The battle of the "angle" is said to have been the most awful in duration
and intensity in modern times.Battle-line after battle-line, bravely
obeying orders, was annihilated.The entrenchments were shivered and
shattered, trunks of trees carved into split brooms.Sometimes the
contestants came so close together that their muskets met, muzzle to
muzzle, and their flags almost intertwined with each other as they waved
in the breeze.As they fought with the desperation of madmen, the living
would stand on the bodies of the dead to reach over the breastworks with
their weapons of slaughter.Lee hurled his army with unparalleled vigor
against his opponent five times during the day, but each time was
repulsed.Until three o'clock the next morning the slaughter continued,
when the Confederates sank back into their second line of entrenchments,
leaving their opponents where they had stood in the morning.All the
fighting on the 12th was not done at the "Bloody Angle."Burnside on the
left of Hancock engaged Early's troops and was defeated, while on the
other side of the salient Wright succeeded in driving Anderson back.The question has naturally arisen why that "salient" was regarded of such
vital importance as to induce the two chief commanders to force their
armies into such a hand-to-hand contest that must inevitably result in
unparalleled and wholesale slaughter.It was manifest, however, that Grant
had shown generalship in finding the weak point in Lee's line for attack.It was imperative that he hold the gain made by his troops.Lee could ill
afford the loss resistance would entail, but he could not withdraw his
army during the day without disaster.The men on both sides seemed to comprehend the gravity of the situation,
that it was a battle to the death for that little point of entrenchment.Without urging by officers, and sometimes without officers, they fell into
line and fought and bled and died in myriads as though inspired by some
unseen power.Here men rushed to their doom with shouts of courage and
eagerness.The pity of it all was manifested by the shocking scene on that
battlefield the next day.Piles of dead lay around the "Bloody Angle," a
veritable "Hell's Hole" on both sides of the entrenchments, four layers
deep in places, shattered and torn by bullets and hoofs and clubbed
muskets, while beneath the layers of dead, it is said, there could be seen
quivering limbs of those who still lived.General Grant was deeply moved at the terrible loss of life.When he
expressed his regret for the heavy sacrifice of men to General Meade, the
latter replied, "General, we can't do these little tricks without heavy
losses."The total loss to the Union army in killed, wounded, and missing
at Spotsylvania was nearly eighteen thousand.The Confederate losses have
never been positively known, but from the best available sources of
information the number has been placed at not less than nine thousand men.Lee's loss in high officers was very severe, the killed including General
Daniel and General Perrin, while Generals Walker, Ramseur, R. D. Johnston,
and McGowan were severely wounded.In addition to the loss of these
important commanders, Lee was further crippled in efficient commanders by
the capture of Generals Edward Johnson and Steuart.The Union loss in high
officers was light, excepting General Sedgwick on the 9th.General Webb
was wounded, and Colonel <DW53>, of the Second Corps, was killed.Lee's forces had been handled with such consummate skill as to make them
count one almost for two, and there was the spirit of devotion for Lee
among his soldiers which was indeed practically hero-worship.All in all,
he had an army, though shattered and worn, that was almost unconquerable.Grant found that ordinary methods of war, even such as he had experienced
in the West, were not applicable to the Army of Northern Virginia.The
only hope for the Union army was a long-drawn-out process, and with larger
numbers, better kept, and more often relieved, Grant's army would
ultimately make that of Lee's succumb, from sheer exhaustion and
disintegration.The battle was not terminated on the 12th.During the next five days there
was a continuous movement of the Union corps to the east which was met by
a corresponding readjustment of the Confederate lines.After various
maneuvers, Hancock was ordered to the point where the battle was fought on
the 12th, and on the 18th and 19th, the last effort was made to break the
lines of the Confederates.Ewell, however, drove the Federals back and the
next day he had a severe engagement with the Union left wing, while
endeavoring to find out something of Grant's plans.Twelve days of active effort were thus spent in skirmishing, fighting, and
countermarching.In the last two engagements the Union losses were nearly
two thousand, which are included in those before stated.It was decided to
abandon the attempt to dislodge Lee from his entrenchments, and to move
to the North Anna River.On the 20th of May the march was resumed.The men
had suffered great hardships from hunger, exposure, and incessant action,
and many would fall asleep on the line of march.On the day after the start, Hancock crossed the Mattapony River at one
point and Warren at another.Hancock was ordered to take position on the
right bank and, if practicable, to attack the Confederates wherever found.By the 22d, Wright and Burnside came up and the march proceeded.But the
vigilant Lee had again detected the plans of his adversary.Meade's army had barely started in its purpose to turn the Confederates'
flank when the Southern forces were on the way to block the army of the
North.As on the march from the Wilderness to Spotsylvania, Lee's troops
took the shorter route, along main roads, and reached the North Anna ahead
of the Federals.Warren's corps was the first of Meade's army to arrive at
the north bank of the river, which it did on the afternoon of May 23d.Lee
was already on the south bank, but Warren crossed without opposition.No
sooner had he gotten over, however, than he was attacked by the
Confederates and a severe but undecisive engagement followed.The next
morning (the 24th) Hancock and Wright put their troops across at places
some miles apart, and before these two wings of the army could be joined,
Lee made a brilliant stroke by marching in between them, forming a wedge
whose point rested on the bank, opposite the Union center, under Burnside,
which had not yet crossed the river.The Army of the Potomac was now in three badly separated parts.Burnside
could not get over in sufficient strength to reenforce the wings, and all
attempts by the latter to aid him in so doing met with considerable
disaster.The loss in these engagements approximated two thousand on each
side.On the 25th, Sheridan and his cavalry rejoined the army.They had been
gone since the 9th and their raid was most successful.Besides the
decisive victory over the Confederate cavalry at Yellow Tavern, they had
destroyed several depots of supplies, four trains of cars, and many miles
of railroad track.Nearly four hundred Federal prisoners on their way to
Richmond had been rescued from their captors.The dashing cavalrymen had
even carried the first line of work around Richmond, and had made a detour
down the James to communicate with General Butler.Grant was highly
satisfied with Sheridan's performance.It had been of the greatest
assistance to him, as it had drawn off the whole of the Confederate
cavalry, and made the guarding of the wagon trains an easy matter.But here, on the banks of the North Anna, Grant had been completely
checkmated by Lee.He realized this and decided on a new move, although he
still clung to his idea of turning the Confederate right.The Federal
wings were withdrawn to the north side of the river during the night of
May 26th and the whole set in motion for the Pamunkey River at
Hanovertown.Two divisions of Sheridan's cavalry and Warren's corps were
in advance.Lee lost no time in pursuing his great antagonist, but for the
first time the latter was able to hold his lead.Along the Totopotomoy, on
the afternoon of May 28th, infantry and cavalry of both armies met in a
severe engagement in which the strong position of Lee's troops again
foiled Grant's purpose.The Union would have to try at some other point,
and on the 31st Sheridan's cavalry took possession of Cold Harbor.This
was to be the next battle-ground.[Illustration: IN THE AUTUMN OF 1863--GRANT'S CHANGING EXPRESSIONS]

Although secure in his fame as the conqueror of Vicksburg, Grant still has
the greater part of his destiny to fulfil as he faces the camera.Before
him lie the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and the slow investment
of Petersburg.This series forms a particularly interesting study in
expression.At the left hand, the face looks almost amused.In the next
the expression is graver, the mouth close set.The third picture looks
plainly obstinate, and in the last the stern fighter might have been
declaring, as in the following spring: "I propose to fight it out on this
line if it takes all summer."The eyes, first unveiled fully in this
fourth view, are the unmistakable index to Grant's stern inflexibility,
once his decision was made.[Illustration: IN THE AUTUMN OF 1864--AFTER THE STRAIN OF THE WILDERNESS
CAMPAIGN]

Here is a furrowed brow above eyes worn by pain.In the pictures of the
previous year the forehead is more smooth, the expression grave yet
confident.Here the expression is that of a man who has won, but won at a
bitter cost.It is the memory of the 50,000 men whom he left in the
Wilderness campaign and at Cold Harbor that has lined this brow, and
closed still tighter this inflexible mouth.Again, as in the series above,
the eyes are not revealed until the last picture.Then again flashes the
determination of a hero.The great general's biographers say that Grant
was a man of sympathy and infinite pity.It was the more difficult for
him, spurred on to the duty by grim necessity, to order forward the lines
in blue that withered, again and again, before the Confederate fire, but
each time weakened the attenuated line which confronted them.[Illustration: MEADE AND SEDGWICK--BEFORE THE ADVANCE THAT BROUGHT

of the civilian who had brought his new-fangled photographic apparatus
into camp suggested a joke.A couple of months later, on the 9th of May,
Sedgwick again was jesting--before Spotsylvania Court House.McMahon of
his staff had begged him to avoid passing some artillery exposed to the
Confederate fire, to which Sedgwick had playfully replied, "McMahon, I
would like to know who commands this corps, you or I?"Then he ordered
some infantry before him to shift toward the right.Their movement drew
the fire of the Confederates.The lines were close together; the situation
tense.A sharpshooter's bullet whistled--Sedgwick fell.He was taken to
Meade's headquarters.The Army of the Potomac had lost another corps
commander, and the Union a brilliant and courageous soldier.[Illustration: SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE

WHERE GRANT WANTED TO "FIGHT IT OUT"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]For miles around this quaint old village-pump surged the lines of two vast
contending armies, May 8-12, 1864.In this picture of only a few months
later, the inhabitants have returned to their accustomed quiet, although
the reverberations of battle have hardly died away.But on May 7th
Generals Grant and Meade, with their staffs, had started toward the little
courthouse.As they passed along the Brock Road in the rear of Hancock's
lines, the men broke into loud hurrahs.They saw that the movement was
still to be southward.But chance had caused Lee to choose the same
objective.Misinterpreting Grant's movement as a retreat upon
Fredericksburg, he sent Longstreet's corps, now commanded by Anderson, to
Spotsylvania.Chance again, in the form of a forest fire, drove Anderson
to make, on the night of May 7th, the march from the Wilderness that he
had been ordered to commence on the morning of the 8th.On that day, while
Warren was contending with the forces of Anderson, Lee's whole army was
entrenching on a ridge around Spotsylvania Court House."Accident," says
Grant, "often decides the fate of battle."But this "accident" was one of
Lee's master moves.[Illustration: THE APEX OF THE BATTLEFIELD

1864, shortly after the struggle of Spotsylvania Court House, and show the
old dwelling as it was on May 12th, when the fighting was at flood tide
all round it; and below, the Confederate entrenchments near that
blood-drenched spot.At a point in these Confederate lines in advance of
the McCool house, the entrenchments had been thrown forward like the
salient of a fort, and the wedge-shaped space within them was destined to
become renowned as the "Bloody Angle."The position was defended by the
famous "Stonewall Division" of the Confederates under command of General
Edward Johnson.It was near the scene of Upton's gallant charge on the
10th.Here at daybreak on May 12th the divisions of the intrepid Barlow
and Birney, sent forward by Hancock, stole a march upon the unsuspecting
Confederates.Leaping over the breastworks the Federals were upon them and
the first of the terrific hand-to-hand conflicts that marked the day
began.It ended in victory for Hancock's men, into whose hands fell 20
cannon, 30 standards and 4,000 prisoners, "the best division in the
Confederate army."[Illustration: CONFEDERATE ENTRENCHMENTS NEAR "BLOODY ANGLE"]

Flushed with success, the Federals pressed on to Lee's second line of
works, where Wilcox's division of the Confederates held them until
reenforcements sent by Lee from Hill and Anderson drove them back.On the
Federal side the Sixth Corps, with Upton's brigade in the advance, was
hurried forward to hold the advantage gained.But Lee himself was on the
scene, and the men of the gallant Gordon's division, pausing long enough
to seize and turn his horse, with shouts of "General Lee in the rear,"
hurtled forward into the conflict.In five separate charges by the
Confederates the fighting came to close quarters.With bayonets, clubbed
muskets, swords and pistols, men fought within two feet of one another on
either side of the entrenchments at "Bloody Angle" till night at last left
it in possession of the Federals.None of the fighting near Spotsylvania
Court House was inglorious.On the 10th, after a day of strengthening
positions on both sides, young Colonel Emory Upton of the 121st New York,
led a storming party of twelve regiments into the strongest of the
Confederate entrenchments.For his bravery Grant made him a
brigadier-general on the field.[Illustration: UNION ARTILLERY MASSING FOR THE ADVANCE THAT EWELL'S ATTACK
DELAYED THAT SAME AFTERNOON

BEVERLY HOUSE, MAY 18, 1864

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The artillery massing in the meadow gives to this view the interest of an
impending tragedy.In the foreground the officers, servants, and orderlies
of the headquarters mess camp are waiting for the command to strike their
tents, pack the wagons, and move on.But at the very time this photograph
was taken they should have been miles away.Grant had issued orders the
day before that should have set these troops in motion.However, the
Confederate General Ewell had chosen the 18th to make an attack on the
right flank.It not only delayed the departure but forced a change in the
intended positions of the division as they had been contemplated by the
commander-in-chief.Beverly House is where General Warren pitched his
headquarters after Spotsylvania, and the spectator is looking toward the
battlefield that lies beyond the distant woods.After Ewell's attack,
Warren again found himself on the right flank, and at this very moment the
main body of the Federal army is passing in the rear of him.The costly
check at Spotsylvania, with its wonderful display of fighting on both
sides, had in its apparently fruitless results called for the display of
all Grant's gifts as a military leader.It takes but little imagination to
supply color to this photograph; it is full of it--full of the movement
and detail of war also.It is springtime; blossoms have just left the
trees and the whole country is green and smiling, but the earth is scarred
by thousands of trampling feet and hoof-prints.Ugly ditches cross the
landscape; the debris of an army marks its onsweep from one battlefield to
another.[Illustration: THE ONES WHO NEVER CAME BACK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.These are some of the men for whom waiting women wept--the ones who never
came back.They belonged to Ewell's Corps, who attacked the Federal lines
so gallantly on May 18th.There may be some who will turn from this
picture with a shudder of horror, but it is no morbid curiosity that will
cause them to study it closely.If pictures such as this were familiar
everywhere there would soon be an end of war.We can realize money by
seeing it expressed in figures; we can realize distances by miles, but
some things in their true meaning can only be grasped and impressions
formed with the seeing eye.Visualizing only this small item of the awful
cost--the cost beside which money cuts no figure--an idea can be gained of
what war is.Here is a sermon in the cause of universal peace.The
handsome lad lying with outstretched arms and clinched fingers is a mute
plea.Death has not disfigured him--he lies in an attitude of relaxation
and composure.Perhaps in some Southern home this same face is pictured in
the old family album, alert and full of life and hope, and here is the
end.Does there not come to the mind the insistent question, "Why?"The
Federal soldiers standing in the picture are not thinking of all this, it
may be true, but had they meditated in the way that some may, as they gaze
at this record of death, it would be worth their while.One of the men is
apparently holding a sprig of blossoms in his hand.[Illustration: IN ONE LONG BURIAL TRENCH

to hide the dreadful work of bullet and shot and shell.No feeling of
bitterness exists in moments such as these.What soldier in the party
knows but what it may be his turn next to lie beside other lumps of clay
and join his earth-mother in this same fashion in his turn.But men become
used to work of any kind, and these men digging up the warm spring soil,
when their labor is concluded, are neither oppressed nor nerve-shattered
by what they have seen and done.They have lost the power of experiencing
sensation.Senses become numbed in a measure; the value of life itself
from close and constant association with death is minimized almost to the
vanishing point.In half an hour these very men may be singing and
laughing as if war and death were only things to be expected, not reasoned
over in the least.[Illustration: ONE OF THE FEARLESS CONFEDERATES]

artillery and an enfilading fire from rifle-pits across the river.Late in
the evening of the 23d, Hancock's corps, arriving before the redoubt, had
assaulted it with two brigades and easily carried it.During the night the
Confederates from the other side made two attacks upon the bridge and
finally succeeded in setting it afire.The flames were extinguished by the
Federals, and on the 24th Hancock's troops crossed over without
opposition.The easy crossing of the Federals here was but another example
of Lee's favorite rule to let his antagonist attack him on the further
side of a stream.Taylor's Bridge could easily have been held by Lee for a
much longer time, but its ready abandonment was part of the tactics by
which Grant was being led into a military dilemma.In the picture the
Federal soldiers confidently hold the captured redoubt, convinced that the
possession of it meant that they had driven Lee to his last corner.[Illustration: "WALK YOUR HORSES"

ONE OF THE GRIM JOKES OF WAR AS PLAYED AT CHESTERFIELD BRIDGE, NORTH ANNA

Telegraph Road crosses the North Anna, was "Walk your horses."The wooden
structure was referred to by the military as Chesterfield bridge.Here
Hancock's Corps arrived toward evening of May 23d, and the Confederate
entrenchments, showing in the foreground, were seized by the old "Berry
Brigade."In the heat of the charge the Ninety-third New York carried
their colors to the middle of the bridge, driving off the Confederates
before they could destroy it.When the Federals began crossing next day
they had to run the gantlet of musketry and artillery fire from the
opposite bank.Several regiments of New York heavy artillery poured across
the structure at the double-quick with the hostile shells bursting about
their heads.When Captain Sleeper's Eighteenth Massachusetts battery began
crossing, the Confederate cannoneers redoubled their efforts to blow up
the ammunition by well-aimed shots.Sleeper passed over only one piece at
a time in order to diminish the target and enforce the observance of the
local law by walking his horses!The Second Corps got no further than the
ridge beyond, where Lee's strong V formation held it from further
advance.[Illustration: A SANITARY-COMMISSION NURSE AND HER PATIENTS AT

conflicts.Although the work of this Commission was only supplementary
after 1862, they continued to supply many delicacies, and luxuries such as
crutches, which did not form part of the regular medical corps
paraphernalia.The effect of their work can be seen here, and also the
appearance of men after the shock of gunshot wounds.All injuries during
the war practically fell under three headings: incised and punctured
wounds, comprising saber cuts, bayonet stabs, and sword thrusts;
miscellaneous, from falls, blows from blunt weapons, and various
accidents; lastly, and chiefly, gunshot wounds.The war came prior to the
demonstration of the fact that the causes of disease and suppurative
conditions are living organisms of microscopic size.Septicemia,
erysipelas, lockjaw, and gangrene were variously attributed to dampness
and a multitude of other conditions.[Illustration: A CHANGE OF BASE--THE CAVALRY SCREEN

COPYRIGHT 1911 PATRIOT PUB.This photograph of May 30, 1864, shows the Federal cavalry in actual
operation of a most important function--the "screening" of the army's
movements.The troopers are guarding the evacuation of Port Royal on the
Rappahannock, May 30, 1864.After the reverse to the Union arms at
Spottsylvania, Grant ordered the change of base from the Rappahannock to
McClellan's former starting-point, White House on the Pamunkey.The
control of the waterways, combined with Sheridan's efficient use of the
cavalry, made this an easy matter.Torbert's division encountered Gordon's
brigade of Confederate cavalry at Hanovertown and drove it in the
direction of Hanover Court House.Gregg's division moved up to this line;
Russell's division of infantry encamped near the river-crossing in
support, and behind the mask thus formed the Army of the Potomac crossed
the Pamunkey on May 28th unimpeded.Gregg was then ordered to reconnoiter
towards Mechanicsville, and after a severe fight at Hawes' shop he
succeeded (with the assistance of Custer's brigade) in driving Hampton's
and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry divisions and Butler's brigade from the field.Although the battle took place immediately in front of the Federal
infantry, General Meade declined to put the latter into action, and the
battle was won by the cavalry alone.COLD HARBOR

    Cold Harbor is, I think, the only battle I ever fought that I would
    not fight over again under the circumstances.I have always regretted
    that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made.--_General U. S.
    Grant in his "Memoirs."_


According to Grant's well-made plans of march, the various corps of the
Army of the Potomac set out from the banks of the North Anna on the night
of May 26, 1864, at the times and by the routes assigned to them.Early on
the morning of May 27th Lee set his force in motion by the Telegraph road
and such others as were available, across the Little and South Anna rivers
toward Ashland and Atlee's Station on the Virginia Central Railroad.Thus the armies were stretched like two live wires along the swampy
bottom-lands of eastern Virginia, and as they came in contact, here and
there along the line, there were the inevitable sputterings of flame and
considerable destruction wrought.The advance Federal infantry crossed the
Pamunkey, after the cavalry, at Hanoverstown, early on May 28th.The
Second Corps was close behind the Sixth; the Fifth was over by noon, while
the Ninth, now an integral portion of the Army of the Potomac, passed the
river by midnight.On the 31st General Sheridan reached Cold Harbor, which Meade had ordered
him to hold at all hazards.This place, probably named after the old home
of some English settler, was not a town but the meeting-place of several
roads of great strategic importance to the Federal army.They led not only
toward Richmond by the way of the upper Chickahominy bridges, but in the
direction of White House Landing, on the Pamunkey River.Both Lee and Meade had received reenforcements--the former by
Breckinridge, and the scattered forces in western Virginia, and by Pickett
and Hoke from North Carolina.From Bermuda Hundred where General Butler
was "bottled up"--to use a phrase which Grant employed and afterward
regretted--General W. F. Smith was ordered to bring the Eighteenth Corps
of the Army of the James to the assistance of Meade, since Butler could
defend his position perfectly well with a small force, and could make no
headway against Beauregard with a large one.Grant had now nearly one
hundred and fourteen thousand troops and Lee about eighty thousand.Sheridan's appearance at Cold Harbor was resented in vain by Fitzhugh Lee,
and the next morning, June 1st, the Sixth Corps arrived, followed by
General Smith and ten thousand men of the Eighteenth, who had hastened
from the landing-place at White House.These took position on the right of
the Sixth, and the Federal line was promptly faced by Longstreet's corps,
a part of A. P. Hill's, and the divisions of Hoke and Breckinridge.At six
o'clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith advanced to the attack, which
Hoke and Kershaw received with courage and determination.The Confederate
line was broken in several places, but before night checked the struggle
the Southerners had in some degree regained their position.The short
contest was a severe one for the Federal side.Wright lost about twelve
hundred men and Smith one thousand.The following day the final dispositions were made for the mighty struggle
that would decide Grant's last chance to interpose between Lee and
Richmond.Hancock and the Second Corps arrived at Cold Harbor and took
position on the left of General Wright.Burnside, with the Ninth Corps,
was placed near Bethesda Church on the road to Mechanicsville, while
Warren, with the Fifth, came to his left and connected with Smith's right.Sheridan was sent to hold the lower Chickahominy bridges and to cover the
road to White House, which was now the base of supplies.On the Southern
side Ewell's corps, now commanded by General Early, faced Burnside's and
Warren's.Longstreet's corps, still under Anderson, was opposite Wright
and Smith, while A. P. Hill, on the extreme right, confronted Hancock.There was sharp fighting during the entire day, but Early did not succeed
in getting upon the Federal right flank, as he attempted to do.Both armies lay very close to each other and were well entrenched.Lee was
naturally strong on his right, and his left was difficult of access, since
it must be approached through wooded swamps.Well-placed batteries made
artillery fire from front and both flanks possible, but Grant decided to
attack the whole Confederate front, and word was sent to the corps
commanders to assault at half-past four the following morning.The hot sultry weather of the preceding days had brought much suffering.The movement of troops and wagons raised clouds of dust which settled down
upon the sweltering men and beasts.But five o'clock on the afternoon of
June 2d brought the grateful rain, and this continued during the night,
giving great relief to the exhausted troops.At the hour designated the Federal lines moved promptly from their shallow
rifle-pits toward the Confederate works.The main assault was made by the
Second, Sixth, and Eighteenth corps.With determined and firm step they
started to cross the space between the opposing entrenchments.The silence
of the dawning summer morning was broken by the screams of musket-ball and
canister and shell.That move of the Federal battle-line opened the fiery
furnace across the intervening space, which was, in the next instant, a
Vesuvius, pouring tons and tons of steel and lead into the moving human
mass.From front, from right and left, artillery crashed and swept the
field, musketry and grape hewed and mangled and mowed down the line of
blue as it moved on its approach.Meade issued orders for the suspension of all further offensive
operations.A word remains to be said as to fortunes of Burnside's and Warren's
forces, which were on the Federal right.Generals Potter and Willcox of
the Ninth Corps made a quick capture of Early's advanced rifle-pits and
were waiting for the order to advance on his main entrenchments, when the
order of suspension arrived.Early fell upon him later in the day but was
repulsed.Warren, on the left of Burnside, drove Rodes' division back and
repulsed Gordon's brigade, which had attacked him.The commander of the
Fifth Corps reported that his line was too extended for further operations
and Birney's division was sent from the Second Corps to his left.But by
the time this got into position the battle of Cold Harbor was practically
over.The losses to the Federal army in this battle and the engagements which
preceded it were over seventeen thousand, while the Confederate loss did
not exceed one-fifth of that number.Grant had failed in his plan to
destroy Lee north of the James River, and saw that he must now cross it.Thirty days had passed in the campaign since the Wilderness and the grand
total in losses to Grant's army in killed, wounded, and missing was
54,929.The losses in Lee's army were never accurately given, but they
were very much less in proportion to the numerical strength of the two
armies.If Grant had inflicted punishment upon his foe equal to that
suffered by the Federal forces, Lee's army would have been practically
annihilated.The Federal general-in-chief had decided to secure Petersburg and confront
Lee once more.General Gillmore was sent by Butler, with cavalry and
infantry, on June 10th to make the capture, but was unsuccessful.Thereupon General Smith and the Eighteenth Corps were despatched to White
House Landing to go forward by water and reach Petersburg before Lee had
time to reenforce it.[Illustration: READY FOR THE ADVANCE THAT LEE DROVE BACK

wings of the Army of the Potomac.But when the center under Burnside was
driven back and severely handled at Ox Ford, Grant immediately detached a
brigade each from Hancock and Warren to attack the apex of Lee's wedge on
the south bank of the river, but the position was too strong to justify
the attempt.Then it dawned upon the Federal general-in-chief that Lee had
cleaved the Army of the Potomac into two separated bodies.To reenforce
either wing would require two crossings of the river, while Lee could
quickly march troops from one side to the other within his impregnable
wedge.As Grant put it in his report, "To make a direct attack from either
wing would cause a slaughter of our men that even success would not
justify."[Illustration: IMPROVISED BREASTWORKS

Confederate lines at Cold Harbor is an example of the crude protection
resorted to by the soldiers on both sides in advance or retreat.A
momentary lull in the battle was invariably employed in strengthening each
position.Trees were felled under fire, and fence rails gathered quickly
were piled up to make possible another stand.The space between the lines
at Cold Harbor was so narrow at many points as to resemble a road,
encumbered with the dead and wounded.This extraordinary proximity induced
a nervous alertness which made the troops peculiarly sensitive to night
alarms; even small parties searching quietly for wounded comrades might
begin a panic.A few scattering shots were often enough to start a heavy
and continuous musketry fire and a roar of artillery along the entire
line.It was a favorite ruse of the Federal soldiers to aim their muskets
carefully to clear the top of the Confederate breastworks and then set up
a great shout.The Confederates, deceived into the belief that an attack
was coming, would spring up and expose themselves to the well-directed
volley which thinned their ranks.COLD HARBOR

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The battle of Cold Harbor on June 3d was the third tremendous engagement
of Grant's campaign against Richmond within a month.It was also his
costliest onset on Lee's veteran army.Grant had risked much in his change
of base to the James in order to bring him nearer to Richmond and to the
friendly hand which Butler with the Army of the James was in a position to
reach out to him.Lee had again confronted him, entrenching himself but
six miles from the outworks of Richmond, while the Chickahominy cut off
any further flanking movement.There was nothing to do but fight it out,
and Grant ordered an attack all along the line.On June 3d he hurled the
Army of the Potomac against the inferior numbers of Lee, and in a brave
assault upon the Confederate entrenchments, lost ten thousand men in
twenty minutes.[Illustration: FEDERAL CAMP AT COLD HARBOR AFTER THE BATTLE

Hancock's division and of the brigades of Gibbon and Barlow, who on the
left of the Federal line charged up the ascent in their front upon the

held it for a moment under a galling fire, which finally drove them back,
but not until they had captured a flag and three hundred prisoners.The
battle was substantially over by half-past seven in the morning, but
sullen fighting continued throughout the day.About noontime General
Grant, who had visited all the corps commanders to see for himself the
positions gained and what could be done, concluded that the Confederates
were too strongly entrenched to be dislodged and ordered that further
offensive action should cease.All the next day the dead and wounded lay
on the field uncared for while both armies warily watched each other.The
lower picture was taken during this weary wait.Not till the 7th was a
satisfactory truce arranged, and then all but two of the wounded Federals
had died.No wonder that Grant wrote, "I have always regretted that the
last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made."[Illustration: THE BUSIEST PLACE IN DIXIE

infinite relief that Grant saw the advance of the Army of the Potomac

hazardous one.More than fifty miles intervened between him and Butler by
the roads he would have to travel, and he had to cross both the
Chickahominy and the James, which were unbridged.The paramount difficulty
was to get the Army of the Potomac out of its position before Lee, who
confronted it at Cold Harbor.Lee had the shorter line and better roads to
move over and meet Grant at the Chickahominy, or he might, if he chose,
descend rapidly on Butler and crush him before Grant could unite with him."But," says Grant, "the move had to be made, and I relied upon Lee's not
seeing my danger as I saw it."Near the old Charles City Court House the
crossing of the James was successfully accomplished, and on the 14th Grant
took steamer and ran up the river to Bermuda Hundred to see General Butler
and direct the movement against Petersburg, that began the final
investment of that city.[Illustration: THE MONITOR IN A STORM._Painted by Robert Hopkin._

TO ATLANTA

    Johnston was an officer who, by the common consent of the military men
    of both sides, was reckoned second only to Lee, if second, in the
    qualities which fit an officer for the responsibility of great
    commands.... He practised a lynx-eyed watchfulness of his adversary,
    tempting him constantly to assault his entrenchments, holding his
    fortified positions to the last moment, but choosing that last moment
    so well as to save nearly every gun and wagon in the final withdrawal,
    and always presenting a front covered by such defenses that one man in
    the line was, by all sound military rules, equal to three or four in
    the attack.In this way he constantly neutralized the superiority of
    force his opponent wielded, and made his campaign from Dalton to the
    Chattahoochee a model of defensive warfare.It is Sherman's glory
    that, with a totally different temperament, he accepted his
    adversary's game, and played it with a skill that was finally
    successful, as we shall see.--_Major-General Jacob D. Cox, U. S. V.,
    in "Atlanta."_


The two leading Federal generals of the war, Grant and Sherman, met at
Nashville, Tennessee, on March 17, 1864, and arranged for a great
concerted double movement against the two main Southern armies, the Army
of Northern Virginia and the Army of Tennessee.Grant, who had been made
commander of all the Federal armies, was to take personal charge of the
Army of the Potomac and move against Lee, while to Sherman, whom, at
Grant's request, President Lincoln had placed at the head of the Military
Division of the Mississippi, he turned over the Western army, which was to
proceed against Johnston.It was decided, moreover, that the two movements were to be simultaneous
and that they were to begin early in May.Sherman concentrated his forces
around Chattanooga on the Tennessee River, where the Army of the
Cumberland had spent the winter, and where a decisive battle had been
fought some months before, in the autumn of 1863.His army was composed of
three parts, or, more properly, of three armies operating in concert.These were the Army of the Tennessee, led by General James B. McPherson;
the Army of Ohio, under General John M. Schofield, and the Army of the
Cumberland, commanded by General George H. Thomas.The last named was much
larger than the other two combined.The triple army aggregated the grand
total of ninety-nine thousand men, six thousand of whom were cavalrymen,
while four thousand four hundred and sixty belonged to the artillery.There were two hundred and fifty-four heavy guns.Soon to be pitted against Sherman's army was that of General Joseph E.
Johnston, which had spent the winter at Dalton, in the State of Georgia,
some thirty miles southeast of Chattanooga.It was by chance that Dalton
became the winter quarters of the Confederate army.In the preceding
autumn, when General Bragg had been defeated on Missionary Ridge and
driven from the vicinity of Chattanooga, he retreated to Dalton and
stopped for a night's rest.Discovering the next morning that he was not
pursued, he there remained.Some time later he was superseded by General
Johnston.By telegraph, General Sherman was apprised of the time when Grant was to
move upon Lee on the banks of the Rapidan, in Virginia, and he prepared to
move his own army at the same time.But he was two days behind Grant, who
began his Virginia campaign on May 4th.Sherman broke camp on the 6th and
led his legions across hill and valley, forest and stream, toward the
Confederate stronghold.Nature was all abloom with the opening of a
Southern spring and the soldiers, who had long chafed under their enforced
idleness, now rejoiced at the exhilarating journey before them, though
their mission was to be one of strife and bloodshed.Johnston's army numbered about fifty-three thousand, and was divided into
two corps, under the respective commands of Generals John B. Hood and
William J. Hardee.But General Polk was on his way to join them, and in a
few days Johnston had in the neighborhood of seventy thousand men.His
position at Dalton was too strong to be carried by a front attack, and
Sherman was too wise to attempt it.Leaving Thomas and Schofield to make a
feint at Johnston's front, Sherman sent McPherson on a flanking movement
by the right to occupy Snake Creek Gap, a mountain pass near Resaca, which
is about eighteen miles below Dalton.Sherman, with the main part of the army, soon occupied Tunnel Hill, which
faces Rocky Face Ridge, an eastern range of the Cumberland Mountains,
north of Dalton, on which a large part of Johnston's army was posted.The
Federal leader had little or no hope of dislodging his great antagonist
from this impregnable position, fortified by rocks and cliffs which no
army could scale while under fire.But he ordered that demonstrations be
made at several places, especially at a pass known as Rocky Face Gap.This
was done with great spirit and bravery, the men clambering over rocks and
across ravines in the face of showers of bullets and even of masses of
stone hurled down from the heights above them.On the whole they won but
little advantage.During the 8th and 9th of May, these operations were continued, the
Federals making but little impression on the Confederate stronghold.Meanwhile, on the Dalton road there was a sharp cavalry fight, the Federal
commander, General E. M. McCook, having encountered General Wheeler.McCook's advance brigade under Colonel La Grange was defeated and La
Grange was made prisoner.Sherman's chief object in these demonstrations, it will be seen, was so to
engage Johnston as to prevent his intercepting McPherson in the latter's
movement upon Resaca.In this Sherman was successful, and by the 11th he
was giving his whole energy to moving the remainder of his forces by the
right flank, as McPherson had done, to Resaca, leaving a detachment of
General O. O. Howard's Fourth Corps to occupy Dalton when evacuated.When
Johnston discovered this, he was quick to see that he must abandon his
entrenchments and intercept Sherman.Moving by the only two good roads,
Johnston beat Sherman in the race to Resaca.The town had been fortified,
owing to Johnston's foresight, and McPherson had failed to dislodge the
garrison and capture it.The Confederate army was now settled behind its
entrenchments, occupying a semicircle of low wooded hills, both flanks of
the army resting on the banks of the Oostenaula River.On the morning of May 14th, the Confederate works were invested by the
greater part of Sherman's army and it was evident that a battle was
imminent.The attack was begun about noon, chiefly by the Fourteenth Army
Corps under Palmer, of Thomas' army, and Judah's division of Schofield's.General Hindman's division of Hood's corps bore the brunt of this attack
and there was heavy loss on both sides.Later in the day, a portion of
Hood's corps was massed in a heavy column and hurled against the Federal
left, driving it back.But at this point the Twentieth Army Corps under
Hooker, of Thomas' army, dashed against the advancing Confederates and
pushed them back to their former lines.The forenoon of the next day was spent in heavy skirmishing, which grew to
the dignity of a battle.During the day's operations a hard fight for a
Confederate lunette on the top of a low hill occurred.At length, General
Butterfield, in the face of a galling fire, succeeded in capturing the
position.But so deadly was the fire from Hardee's corps that Butterfield
was unable to hold it or to remove the four guns the lunette contained.With the coming of night, General Johnston determined to withdraw his army
from Resaca.The battle had cost each army nearly three thousand men.While it was in progress, McPherson, sent by Sherman, had deftly marched
around Johnston's left with the view of cutting off his retreat south by
seizing the bridges across the Oostenaula, and at the same time the
Federal cavalry was threatening the railroad to Atlanta which ran beyond
the river.It was the knowledge of these facts that determined the
Confederate commander to abandon Resaca.Withdrawing during the night, he
led his army southward to the banks of the Etowah River.Sherman followed
but a few miles behind him.At the same time Sherman sent a division of
the Army of the Cumberland, under General Jeff.C. Davis, to Rome, at the
junction of the Etowah and the Oostenaula, where there were important
machine-shops and factories.Davis captured the town and several heavy
guns, destroyed the factories, and left a garrison to hold it.Sherman was eager for a battle in the open with Johnston and on the 17th,
near the town of Adairsville, it seemed as if the latter would gratify
him.Johnston chose a good position, posted his cavalry, deployed his
infantry, and awaited combat.The skirmishing
for some hours almost amounted to a battle.But suddenly Johnston decided
to defer a conclusive contest to another time.Again at Cassville, a few days later, Johnston drew up the Confederate
legions in battle array, evidently having decided on a general engagement
at this point.He issued a spirited address to the army: "By your courage
and skill you have repulsed every assault of the enemy.... You will now
turn and march to meet his advancing columns.... I lead you to battle."But, when his right flank had been turned by a Federal attack, and when
two of his corps commanders, Hood and Polk, advised against a general
battle, Johnston again decided on postponement.He retreated in the night
across the Etowah, destroyed the bridges, and took a strong position among
the rugged hills about Allatoona Pass, extending south to Kenesaw
Mountain.Johnston's decision to fight and then not to fight was a cause for
grumbling both on the part of his army and of the inhabitants of the
region through which he was passing.His men were eager to defend their
country, and they could not understand this Fabian policy.They would have
preferred defeat to these repeated retreats with no opportunity to show
what they could do.Johnston, however, was wiser than his critics.The Union army was larger
by far and better equipped than his own, and Sherman was a
master-strategist.His hopes rested on two or three contingencies that he
might catch a portion of Sherman's army separated from the rest; that
Sherman would be so weakened by the necessity of guarding the long line of
railroad to his base of supplies at Chattanooga, Nashville, and even
far-away Louisville, as to make it possible to defeat him in open battle,
or, finally, that Sherman might fall into the trap of making a direct
attack while Johnston was in an impregnable position, and in such a
situation he now was.Not yet, however, was Sherman inclined to fall into such a trap, and when
Johnston took his strong position at and beyond Allatoona Pass, the
Northern commander decided, after resting his army for a few days, to move
toward Atlanta by way of Dallas, southwest of the pass.Rations for a
twenty days' absence from direct railroad communication were issued to the
Federal army.In fact, Sherman's railroad connection with the North was
the one delicate problem of the whole movement.The Confederates had
destroyed the iron way as they moved southward; but the Federal engineers,
following the army, repaired the line and rebuilt the bridges almost as
fast as the army could march.Sherman's movement toward Dallas drew Johnston from the <DW72>s of the
Allatoona Hills.From Kingston, the Federal leader wrote on May 23d, "I am
already within fifty miles of Atlanta."But he was not to enter that city
for many weeks, not before he had measured swords again and again with his
great antagonist.On the 25th of May, the two great armies were facing
each other near New Hope Church, about four miles north of Dallas.Here,
for three or four days, there was almost incessant fighting, though there
was not what might be called a pitched battle.Late in the afternoon of the first day, Hooker made a vicious attack on
Stewart's division of Hood's corps.For two hours the battle raged without
a moment's cessation, Hooker being pressed back with heavy loss.During
those two hours he had held his ground against sixteen field-pieces and
five thousand infantry at close range.The name "Hell Hole" was applied to
this spot by the Union soldiers.On the next day there was considerable skirmishing in different places
along the line that divided the two armies.But the chief labor of the day
was throwing up entrenchments, preparatory to a general engagement.The
country, however, was ill fitted for such a contest.The continuous
succession of hills, covered with primeval forests, presented little
opportunity for two great armies, stretched out almost from Dallas to
Marietta, a distance of about ten miles, to come together simultaneously
at all points.A severe contest occurred on the 27th, near the center of the
battle-lines, between General O. O. Howard on the Federal side and General
Patrick Cleburne on the part of the South.Dense and almost impenetrable
was the undergrowth through which Howard led his troops to make the
attack.The fight was at close range and was fierce and bloody, the
Confederates gaining the greater advantage.The next day Johnston made a terrific attack on the Union right, under
McPherson, near Dallas.But McPherson was well entrenched and the
Confederates were repulsed with a serious loss.In the three or four days'
fighting the Federal loss was probably twenty-four hundred men and the
Confederate somewhat greater.In the early days of June, Sherman took possession of the town of
Allatoona and made it a second base of supplies, after repairing the
railroad bridge across the Etowah River.Johnston swung his left around to
Lost Mountain and his right extended beyond the railroad--a line ten miles
in length and much too long for its numbers.Johnston's army, however, had
been reenforced, and it now numbered about seventy-five thousand men.Sherman, on June 1st, had nearly one hundred and thirteen thousand men and
on the 8th he received the addition of a cavalry brigade and two divisions
of the Seventeenth Corps, under General Frank P. Blair, which had marched
from Alabama.So multifarious were the movements of the two great armies among the hills
and forests of that part of Georgia that it is impossible for us to follow
them all.On the 14th of June, Generals Johnston, Hardee, and Polk rode up
the <DW72> of Pine Mountain to reconnoiter.As they were standing, making
observations, a Federal battery in the distance opened on them and General
Polk was struck in the chest with a Parrot shell.General Polk was greatly beloved, and his death caused a shock to the
whole Confederate army.He was a graduate of West Point; but after being
graduated he took orders in the church and for twenty years before the war
was Episcopal Bishop of Louisiana.At the outbreak of the war he entered
the field and served with distinction to the moment of his death.During the next two weeks there was almost incessant fighting, heavy
skirmishing, sparring for position.It was a wonderful game of military
strategy, played among the hills and mountains and forests by two masters
in the art of war.On June 23d, Sherman wrote, "The whole country is one
vast fort, and Johnston must have full fifty miles of connected
trenches.... Our lines are now in close contact, and the fighting
incessant.... As fast as we gain one position, the enemy has another all
ready."Sherman, conscious of superior strength, was now anxious for a real
battle, a fight to the finish with his antagonist.But Johnston was too
wily to be thus caught.He made no false move on the great chessboard of
war.At length, the impatient Sherman decided to make a general front
attack, even though Johnston, at that moment, was impregnably entrenched
on the <DW72>s of Kenesaw Mountain.This was precisely what the Confederate
commander was hoping for.The desperate battle of Kenesaw Mountain occurred on the 27th of June.In
the early morning hours, the boom of Federal cannon announced the opening
of a bloody day's struggle.It was soon answered by the Confederate
batteries in the entrenchments along the mountain side, and the deafening
roar of the giant conflict reverberated from the surrounding hills.About
nine o'clock the Union infantry advance began.On the left was McPherson,
who sent the Fifteenth Army Corps, led by General John A. Logan, directly
against the mountain.The artillery from the Confederate trenches in front
of Logan cut down his men by hundreds.The Federals charged courageously
and captured the lower works, but failed to take the higher ridges.The chief assault of the day was by the Army of the Cumberland, under
Thomas.Most conspicuous in the attack were the divisions of Newton and
Davis, advancing against General Loring, successor of the lamented Polk.Far up on a ridge at one point, General Cleburne held a line of
breastworks, supported by the flanking fire of artillery.Against this a
vain and costly assault was made.When the word was given to charge, the Federals sprang forward and, in the
face of a deadly hail of musket-balls and shells, they dashed up the
<DW72>, firing as they went.Stunned and bleeding, they were checked again
and again by the withering fire from the mountain <DW72>; but they
re-formed and pressed on with dauntless valor.Some of them reached the
parapets and were instantly shot down, their bodies rolling into the
Confederate trenches among the men who had slain them, or back down the
hill whence they had come.General Harker, leading a charge against
Cleburne, was mortally wounded.His men were swept back by a galling fire,
though many fell with their brave leader.This assault on Kenesaw Mountain cost Sherman three thousand men and won
him nothing.The battle
continued but two and a half hours.It was one of the most recklessly
daring assaults during the whole war period, but did not greatly affect
the final result of the campaign.Under a flag of truce, on the day after the battle, the men of the North
and of the South met on the gory field to bury their dead and to minister
to the wounded.They met as friends for the moment, and not as foes.It
was said that there were instances of father and son, one in blue and the
other in gray, and brothers on opposite sides, meeting one another on the
bloody <DW72>s of Kenesaw.Tennessee and Kentucky had sent thousands of men
to each side in the fratricidal struggle and not infrequently families had
been divided.Three weeks of almost incessant rain fell upon the struggling armies
during this time, rendering their operations disagreeable and
unsatisfactory.The camp equipage, the men's uniforms and accouterments
were thoroughly saturated with rain and mud.Still the warriors of the
North and of the South lived and fought on the <DW72>s of the mountain
range, intent on destroying each other.Sherman was convinced by his drastic repulse at Kenesaw Mountain that
success lay not in attacking his great antagonist in a strong position,
and he resumed his old tactics.He would flank Johnston from Kenesaw as he
had flanked him out of Dalton and Allatoona Pass.He thereupon turned upon
Johnston's line of communication with Atlanta, whence the latter received
his supplies.The movement was successful, and in a few days Kenesaw
Mountain was deserted.Johnston moved to the banks of the Chattahoochee, Sherman following in
the hope of catching him while crossing the river.But the wary
Confederate had again, as at Resaca, prepared entrenchments in advance,
and these were on the north bank of the river.He hastened to them, then
turned on the approaching Federals and defiantly awaited attack.But
Sherman remembered Kenesaw and there was no battle.The feints, the sparring, the flanking movements among the hills and
forests continued day after day.The immediate aim in the early days of
July was to cross the Chattahoochee.On the 8th, Sherman sent Schofield
and McPherson across, ten miles or more above the Confederate position.Sherman's position was by no means reassuring.It is true he had, in the
space of two months, pressed his antagonist back inch by inch for more
than a hundred miles and was now almost within sight of the goal of the
campaign--the city of Atlanta.But the single line of railroad that
connected him with the North and brought supplies from Louisville, five
hundred miles away, for a hundred thousand men and twenty-three thousand
animals, might at any moment be destroyed by Confederate raiders.The necessity of guarding the Western and Atlantic Railroad was an
ever-present concern with Sherman.Forrest and his cavalry force were in
northern Mississippi waiting for him to get far enough on the way to
Atlanta for them to pounce upon the iron way and tear it to ruins.To
prevent this General Samuel D. Sturgis, with eight thousand troops, was
sent from Memphis against Forrest.He met him on the 10th of June near
Guntown, Mississippi, but was sadly beaten and driven back to Memphis, one
hundred miles away.The affair, nevertheless, delayed Forrest in his
operations against the railroad, and meanwhile General Smith's troops
returned to Memphis from the Red River expedition, somewhat late according
to the schedule but eager to join Sherman in the advance on Atlanta.Smith, however, was directed to take the offensive against Forrest, and
with fourteen thousand troops, and in a three days' fight, demoralized him
badly at Tupelo, Mississippi, July 14th-17th.Smith returned to Memphis
and made another start for Sherman, when he was suddenly turned back and
sent to Missouri, where the Confederate General Price was extremely
active, to help Rosecrans.To avoid final defeat and to win the ground he had gained had taxed
Sherman's powers to the last degree and was made possible only through his
superior numbers.Even this degree of success could not be expected to
continue if the railroad to the North should be destroyed.But Sherman
must do more than he had done; he must capture Atlanta, this Richmond of
the far South, with its cannon foundries and its great machine-shops, its
military factories, and extensive army supplies.He must divide the
Confederacy north and south as Grant's capture of Vicksburg had split it
east and west.Sherman must have Atlanta, for political reasons as well as for military
purposes.The country was in the midst of a presidential campaign.The
opposition to Lincoln's reelection was strong, and for many weeks it was
believed on all sides that his defeat was inevitable.At least, the
success of the Union arms in the field was deemed essential to Lincoln's
success at the polls.Grant had made little progress in Virginia and his
terrible repulse at Cold Harbor, in June, had cast a gloom over every
Northern State.Farragut was operating in Mobile Bay; but his success was
still in the future.The eyes of the supporters of the great war-president turned longingly,
expectantly, toward General Sherman and his hundred thousand men before
Atlanta."Do something--something spectacular--save the party and save the
country thereby from permanent disruption!"This was the cry of the
millions, and Sherman understood it.But withal, the capture of the
Georgia city may have been doubtful but for the fact that at the critical
moment the Confederate President made a decision that resulted,
unconsciously, in a decided service to the Union cause.He dismissed
General Johnston and put another in his place, one who was less strategic
and more impulsive.Jefferson Davis did not agree with General Johnston's military judgment,
and he seized on the fact that Johnston had so steadily retreated before
the Northern army as an excuse for his removal.On the 18th of July, Davis
turned the Confederate Army of Tennessee over to General John B. Hood.A
graduate of West Point of the class of 1853, a classmate of McPherson,
Schofield, and Sheridan, Hood had faithfully served the cause of the South
since the opening of the war.He was known as a fighter, and it was
believed that he would change the policy of Johnston to one of open battle
with Sherman's army.Johnston had lost, since the opening of the campaign at Dalton, about
fifteen thousand men, and the army that he now delivered to Hood consisted
of about sixty thousand in all.While Hood was no match for Sherman as a strategist, he was not a
weakling.His policy of aggression, however, was not suited to the
circumstances--to the nature of the country--in view of the fact that
Sherman's army was far stronger than his own.Two days after Hood took command of the Confederate army he offered
battle.Sherman's forces had crossed Peach Tree Creek, a small stream
flowing into the Chattahoochee, but a few miles from Atlanta, and were
approaching the city.They had thrown up slight breastworks, as was their
custom, but were not expecting an attack.Suddenly, however, about four
o'clock in the afternoon of July 20th, an imposing column of Confederates
burst from the woods near the position of the Union right center, under
Thomas.The battle was short,
fierce, and bloody.The Confederates made a gallant assault, but were
pressed back to their entrenchments, leaving the ground covered with dead
and wounded.The Federal loss in the battle of Peach Tree Creek was
placed at over seventeen hundred, the Confederate loss being much greater.This battle had been planned by Johnston before his removal, but he had
been waiting for the strategic moment to fight it.Two days later, July 22d, occurred the greatest engagement of the entire
campaign--the battle of Atlanta.The Federal army was closing in on the
entrenchments of Atlanta, and was now within two or three miles of the
city.On the night of the 21st, General Blair, of McPherson's army, had
gained possession of a high hill on the left, which commanded a view of
the heart of the city.Hood thereupon planned to recapture this hill, and
make a general attack on the morning of the 22d.He sent General Hardee on
a long night march around the extreme flank of McPherson's army, the
attack to be made at daybreak.Meantime, General Cheatham, who had
succeeded to the command of Hood's former corps, and General A. P.
Stewart, who now had Polk's corps, were to engage Thomas and Schofield in
front and thus prevent them from sending aid to McPherson.Hardee was delayed in his fifteen-mile night march, and it was noon before
he attacked.At about that hour Generals Sherman and McPherson sat talking
near the Howard house, which was the Federal headquarters, when the sudden
boom of artillery from beyond the hill that Blair had captured announced
the opening of the coming battle.McPherson quickly leaped upon his horse
and galloped away toward the sound of the guns.Meeting Logan and Blair
near the railroad, he conferred with them for a moment, when they
separated, and each hastened to his place in the battle-line.McPherson
sent aides and orderlies in various directions with despatches, until but
two were still with him.He then rode into a forest and was suddenly
confronted by a portion of the Confederate army under General Cheatham."Surrender," was the call that rang out.But he wheeled his horse as if to
flee, when he was instantly shot dead, and the horse galloped back
riderless.The death of the brilliant, dashing young leader, James B. McPherson, was
a great blow to the Union army.But thirty-six years of age, one of the
most promising men in the country, and already the commander of a military
department, McPherson was the only man in all the Western armies whom
Grant, on going to the East, placed in the same military class with
Sherman.Logan succeeded the fallen commander, and the battle raged on.The
Confederates were gaining headway.Cheatham
was pressing on, pouring volley after volley into the ranks of the Army of
the Tennessee, which seemed about to be cut in twain.General Sherman was present and saw
the danger.Calling for Schofield to send several batteries, he placed
them and poured a concentrated artillery fire through the gap and mowed
down the advancing men in swaths.At the same time, Logan pressed forward
and Schofield's infantry was called up.The Confederates were hurled back
with great loss.The shadows of night fell--and the battle of Atlanta was
over.Hood's losses exceeded eight thousand of his brave men, whom he
could ill spare.The Confederate army recuperated within the defenses of Atlanta--behind an
almost impregnable barricade.Sherman had no hope of carrying the city by
assault, while to surround and invest it was impossible with his numbers.He determined, therefore, to strike Hood's lines of supplies.On July
28th, Hood again sent Hardee out from his entrenchments to attack the Army
of the Tennessee, now under the command of General Howard.A fierce battle
at Ezra Church on the west side of the city ensued, and again the
Confederates were defeated with heavy loss.A month passed and Sherman had made little progress toward capturing
Atlanta.Two cavalry raids which he organized resulted in defeat, but the
two railroads from the south into Atlanta were considerably damaged.But,
late in August, the Northern commander made a daring move that proved
successful.Leaving his base of supplies, as Grant had done before
Vicksburg, and marching toward Jonesboro, Sherman destroyed the Macon and
Western Railroad, the only remaining line of supplies to the Confederate
army.Hood attempted to block the march on Jonesboro, and Hardee was sent with
his and S. D. Lee's Corps to attack the Federals, while he himself sought
an opportunity to move upon Sherman's right flank.Hardee's attack failed,
and this necessitated the evacuation of Atlanta.After blowing up his
magazines and destroying the supplies which his men could not carry with
them, Hood abandoned the city, and the next day, September 2d, General
Slocum, having succeeded Hooker, led the Twentieth Corps of the Federal
army within its earthen walls.Hood had made his escape, saving his army
from capture.His chief desire would have been to march directly north on
Marietta and destroy the depots of Federal supplies, but a matter of more
importance prevented.Thirty-four thousand Union prisoners were confined
at Andersonville, and a small body of cavalry could have released them.So
Hood placed himself between Andersonville and Sherman.In the early days of September the Federal hosts occupied the city toward
which they had toiled all the summer long.At East Point, Atlanta, and
Decatur, the three armies settled for a brief rest, while the cavalry,
stretched for many miles along the Chattahoochee, protected their flanks
and rear.Since May their ranks had been depleted by some twenty-eight
thousand killed and wounded, while nearly four thousand had fallen
prisoners, into the Confederates' hands.It was a great price, but whatever else the capture of Atlanta did, it
ensured the reelection of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency of the United
States.The total Confederate losses were in the neighborhood of
thirty-five thousand, of which thirteen thousand were prisoners.[Illustration: SHERMAN IN 1865

fighting was over.To Joseph E. Johnston he offered most liberal terms of
surrender for the Southern armies.Their acceptance would have gone far to
prevent the worst of the reconstruction enormities.Unfortunately his
first convention with Johnston was disapproved.The death of Lincoln had
removed the guiding hand that would have meant so much to the nation.To
those who have read his published correspondence and his memoirs Sherman
appears in a very human light.He was fluent and frequently reckless in
speech and writing, but his kindly humanity is seen in both.[Illustration: BUZZARD'S ROOST, GEORGIA, MAY 7, 1864]

In the upper picture rises the precipitous height of Rocky Face as Sherman
saw it on May 7, 1864.His troops under Thomas had moved forward along the
line of the railroad, opening the great Atlanta campaign on schedule time.Looking down into the gorge called Buzzard's Roost, through which the
railroad passes, Sherman could see swarms of Confederate troops, the road
filled with obstructions, and hostile batteries crowning the cliffs on
either side.He knew that his antagonist, Joe Johnston, here confronted
him in force.But it was to be a campaign of brilliant flanking movements,
and Sherman sat quietly down to wait till the trusty McPherson should
execute the first one.In the lower picture, drawn up on dress parade, stands one of the finest
fighting organizations in the Atlanta campaign.This regiment won its
spurs in the first Union victory in the West at Mill Springs, Kentucky,
January 19, 1862.There, according to the muster-out roll, "William Blake,
musician, threw away his drum and took a gun."The spirit of this drummer
boy of Company F was the spirit of all the troops from Minnesota.A
Georgian noticed an unusually fine body of men marching by, and when told
that they were a Minnesota regiment, said, "I didn't know they had any
troops up there."But the world was to learn the superlative fighting
qualities of the men from the Northwest.Sherman was glad to have all he
could get of them in this great army of one hundred thousand veterans.[Illustration: THE SECOND MINNESOTA INFANTRY--ENGAGED AT ROCKY FACE RIDGE,

General Richard W. Johnson, ready to advance with his cavalry division in
the vanguard of the direct movement upon the Confederates strongly posted
at Dalton.Sherman's cavalry forces under Stoneman and Garrard were not
yet fully equipped and joined the army after the campaign had opened.General Richard W. Johnson's division of Thomas' command, with General
Palmer's division, was given the honor of heading the line of march when
the Federals got in motion on May 5th.The same troops (Palmer's division)
had made the same march in February, sent by Grant to engage Johnston at
Dalton during Sherman's Meridian campaign.Johnson was a West Pointer; he
had gained his cavalry training in the Mexican War, and had fought the
Indians on the Texas border.He distinguished himself at Corinth, and
rapidly rose to the command of a division in Buell's army.Fresh from a
Confederate prison, he joined the Army of the Cumberland in the summer of
1862 to win new laurels at Stone's River, Chickamauga, and Missionary
Ridge.His sabers were conspicuously active in the Atlanta campaign; and
at the battle of New Hope Church on May 28th Johnson himself was wounded,
but recovered in time to join Schofield after the fall of Atlanta and to
assist him in driving Hood and Forrest out of Tennessee.For his bravery
at the battle of Nashville he was brevetted brigadier-general, U. S. A.,
December 16, 1864, and after the war he was retired with the brevet of
major-general.[Illustration: RESACA--FIELD OF THE FIRST HEAVY FIGHTING

had caused to be thrown up by the <DW64> laborers all along his line of
possible retreat.McPherson, sent by Sherman to strike the railroad in
Johnston's rear, got his head of column through Snake Creek Gap on May
9th, and drove off a Confederate cavalry brigade which retreated toward
Dalton, bringing to Johnston the first news that a heavy force of Federals
was already in his rear.McPherson, within a mile and a half of Resaca,
could have walked into the town with his twenty-three thousand men, but
concluded that the Confederate entrenchments were too strongly held to
assault.When Sherman arrived he found that Johnston, having the shorter
route, was there ahead of him with his entire army strongly posted.On May
15th, "without attempting to assault the fortified works," says Sherman,
"we pressed at all points, and the sound of cannon and musketry rose all
day to the dignity of a battle."Its havoc is seen in the shattered trees
and torn ground in the lower picture.[Illustration: THE WORK OF THE FIRING AT RESACA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: ANOTHER RETROGRADE MOVEMENT OVER THE ETOWAH BRIDGE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The strong works in the pictures, commanding the railroad bridge over the
Etowah River, were the fourth fortified position to be abandoned by
Johnston within a month.Pursued by Thomas from Resaca, he had made a
brief stand at Kingston and then fallen back steadily and in superb order
into Cassville.There he issued an address to his army announcing his
purpose to retreat no more but to accept battle.His troops were all drawn
up in preparation for a struggle, but that night at supper with Generals
Hood and Polk he was convinced by them that the ground occupied by their
troops was untenable, being enfiladed by the Federal artillery.Johnston,
therefore, gave up his purpose of battle, and on the night of May 20th put
the Etowah River between himself and Sherman and retreated to Allatoona
Pass, shown in the lower picture.[Illustration: ALLATOONA PASS IN THE DISTANCE]

In taking this the camera was planted inside the breastworks seen on the
eminence in the upper picture.Sherman's army now rested after its rapid
advance and waited a few days for the railroad to be repaired in their
rear so that supplies could be brought up.Meanwhile Johnston was being
severely criticized at the South for his continual falling back without
risking a battle.His friends stoutly maintained that it was all
strategic, while some of the Southern newspapers quoted the Federal
General Scott's remark, "Beware of Lee advancing, and watch Johnston at a
stand; for the devil himself would be defeated in the attempt to whip him
retreating."But General Jeff C. Davis, sent by Sherman, took Rome on May
17th and destroyed valuable mills and foundries.Thus began the
accomplishment of one of the main objects of Sherman's march.[Illustration: PINE MOUNTAIN, WHERE POLK, THE FIGHTING BISHOP OF THE
CONFEDERACY, WAS KILLED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The blasted pine rears its gaunt height above the mountain <DW72>, covered
with trees slashed down to hold the Federals at bay; and here, on June 14,
1864, the Confederacy lost a commander, a bishop, and a hero.Lieut.-General Leonidas Polk, commanding one of Johnston's army corps,
with Johnston himself and Hardee, another corps commander, was studying
Sherman's position at a tense moment of the latter's advance around Pine
Mountain.The three Confederates stood upon the rolling height, where the
center of Johnston's army awaited the Federal attack.They could see the
columns in blue pushing east of them; the smoke and rattle of musketry as
the pickets were driven in; and the bustle with which the Federal advance
guard felled trees and constructed trenches at their very feet.On the
lonely height the three figures stood conspicuous.A Federal order was
given the artillery to open upon any men in gray who looked like officers
reconnoitering the new position.So, while Hardee was pointing to his
comrade and his chief the danger of one of his divisions which the Federal
advance was cutting off, the bishop-general was struck in the chest by a
cannon shot.Thus the Confederacy lost a leader of unusual influence.Although a bishop of the Episcopal Church, Polk was educated at West
Point.When he threw in his lot with the Confederacy, thousands of his
fellow-Louisianians followed him.A few days before the battle of Pine
Mountain, as he and General Hood were riding together, the bishop was told
by his companion that he had never been received into the communion of a
church and was begged that the rite might be performed.At Hood's headquarters, by the light of a tallow
candle, with a tin basin on the mess table for a baptismal font, and with
Hood's staff present as witnesses, all was ready.Hood, "with a face like
that of an old crusader," stood before the bishop.Crippled by wounds at
Gaines' Mill, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga, he could not kneel, but bent
forward on his crutches.The bishop, in full uniform of the Confederate
army, administered the rite.A few days later, by a strange coincidence,
he was approached by General Johnston on the same errand, and the man whom
Hood was soon to succeed was baptized in the same simple manner.Polk, as
Bishop, had administered his last baptism, and as soldier had fought his
last battle; for Pine Mountain was near.[Illustration: LIEUT.-GEN.LEONIDAS POLK, C. S.[Illustration: IN THE HARDEST FIGHT OF THE CAMPAIGN--THE

troops in the wooded country.Nevertheless he must either assault
Johnston's strong position on the mountain or begin again his flanking
tactics.He decided upon the former, and on June 27th, after three days'
preparation, the assault was made.At nine in the morning along the
Federal lines the furious fire of musketry and artillery was begun, but at
all points the Confederates met it with determined courage and in great
force.McPherson's attacking column, under General Blair, fought its way
up the face of little Kenesaw but could not reach the summit.Then the
courageous troops of Thomas charged up the face of the mountain and
planted their colors on the very parapet of the Confederate works.Here
General Harker, commanding the brigade in which fought the 125th Ohio,
fell mortally wounded, as did Brigadier-General Daniel McCook, and also

already fought as one of the eight batteries at Fort Henry and Fort
Donelson, heard the roar of the battle of Shiloh, and participated in the
sieges of Corinth and Vicksburg.The artillery in the West was not a whit
less necessary to the armies than that in the East.Pope's brilliant feat
of arms in the capture of Island No.10 added to the growing respect in
which the artillery was held by the other arms of the service.The
effective fire of the massed batteries at Murfreesboro turned the tide of
battle.At Chickamauga the Union artillery inflicted fearful losses upon
the Confederates.At Atlanta again they counted their dead by the
hundreds, and at Franklin and Nashville the guns maintained the best
traditions of the Western armies.They played no small part in winning
battles.[Illustration: THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS NEAR MARIETTA DURING THE FIGHTING OF

until he is actually farther from Atlanta than Sherman's right flank.Who
will reach the Chattahoochee first?There, if anywhere, Johnston must make
his stand; he must hold the fords and ferries, and the fortifications
that, with the wisdom of a far-seeing commander, he has for a long time
been preparing.The rustic work in the photograph, which embowers the
tents of the commanding general and his staff, is the sort of thing that
Civil War soldiers had learned to throw up within an hour after pitching
camp.[Illustration: PALISADES AND _CHEVAUX-DE-FRISE_ GUARDING ATLANTA

keypoints in the Confederate defense, the fort at the head of Marietta
Street, toward which the Federal lines were advancing from the northwest.The old Potter house in the background, once a quiet, handsome country
seat, is now surrounded by bristling fortifications, palisades, and double
lines of _chevaux-de-frise_.Atlanta was engaged in the final grapple with
the force that was to overcome her.Sherman has fought his way past
Kenesaw and across the Chattahoochee, through a country which he describes
as "one vast fort," saying that "Johnston must have at least fifty miles
of connected trenches with abatis and finished batteries."Anticipating
that Sherman might drive him back upon Atlanta, Johnston had constructed,
during the winter, heavily fortified positions all the way from Dalton.During his two months in retreat the fortifications at Atlanta had been
strengthened to the utmost.What he might have done behind them was never
to be known.[Illustration: THE CHATTAHOOCHEE BRIDGE]

"One of the strongest pieces of field fortification I ever saw"--this was
Sherman's characterization of the entrenchments that guarded the railroad
bridge over the Chattahoochee on July 5th.A glimpse of the bridge and the
freshly-turned earth in 1864 is given by the upper picture.At this river
Johnston made his final effort to hold back Sherman from a direct attack
upon Atlanta.If Sherman could get successfully across that river, the
Confederates would be compelled to fall back behind the defenses of the
city, which was the objective of the campaign.Sherman perceived at once
the futility of trying to carry by assault this strongly garrisoned
position.Instead, he made a feint at crossing the river lower down, and
simultaneously went to work in earnest eight miles north of the bridge.The lower picture shows the canvas pontoon boats as perfected by Union
engineers in 1864.A number of these were stealthily set up and launched
by Sherman's Twenty-third Corps near the mouth of Soap Creek, behind a
ridge.Byrd's brigade took the defenders of the southern bank completely
by surprise.It was short work for the Federals to throw pontoon bridges
across and to occupy the coveted spot in force.[Illustration: INFANTRY AND ARTILLERY CROSSING ON BOATS MADE OF PONTOONS

warfare," declares one of Sherman's own division commanders, Jacob D. Cox.There was not a man in the Federal army from Sherman down that did not
rejoice to hear that Johnston had been superseded by Hood on July 18th.Johnston, whose mother was a niece of Patrick Henry, was fifty-seven years
old, cold in manner, measured and accurate in speech.His dark firm face,
surmounted by a splendidly intellectual forehead, betokened the
experienced and cautious soldier.His dismissal was one of the political
mistakes which too often hampered capable leaders on both sides.His
Fabian policy in Georgia was precisely the same as that which was winning
fame against heavy odds for Lee in Virginia.[Illustration: GENERAL JOSEPH EGGLESTON JOHNSTON, C. S. A.

The countenance of Hood, on the other hand, indicates an eager, restless
energy, an impetuosity that lacked the poise of Sherman, whose every
gesture showed the alertness of mind and soundness of judgment that in him
were so exactly balanced.Both Schofield and McPherson were classmates of
Hood at West Point, and characterized him to Sherman as "bold even to
rashness and courageous in the extreme."He struck the first offensive
blow at Sherman advancing on Atlanta, and wisely adhered to the plan of
the battle as it had been worked out by Johnston just before his removal.But the policy of attacking was certain to be finally disastrous to the
Confederates.[Illustration: PEACH-TREE CREEK, WHERE HOOD HIT HARD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Counting these closely clustered Federal graves gives one an idea of the
overwhelming onset with Hood become the aggressor on July 20th.Beyond the
graves are some of the trenches from which the Federals were at first
irresistibly driven.In the background flows Peach-Tree Creek, the little
stream that gives its name to the battlefield.Hood, impatient to
signalize his new responsibility by a stroke that would at once dispel the
gloom at Richmond, had posted his troops behind strongly fortified works
on a ridge commanding the valley of Peach-Tree Creek about five miles to
the north of Atlanta.As the
Federals were disposing their lines and entrenching before this position,
Hood's eager eyes detected a gap in their formation and at four o'clock in
the afternoon hurled a heavy force against it.Thus he proved his
reputation for courage, but the outcome showed the mistake.For a brief
interval Sherman's forces were in great peril.But the Federals under
Newton and Geary rallied and held their ground, till Ward's division in a
brave counter-charge drove the Confederates back.He abandoned his entrenchments that night, leaving on the field
five hundred dead, one thousand wounded, and many prisoners.Sherman
estimated the total Confederate loss at no less than five thousand.That
of the Federals was fifteen hundred.[Illustration: THE ARMY'S FINGER-TIPS--PICKETS BEFORE ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.A Federal picket post on the lines before Atlanta.This picture was taken
shortly before the battle of July 22d.The soldiers are idling about
unconcerned at exposing themselves; this is on the "reserve post."Somewhat in advance of this lay the outer line of pickets, and it would be
time enough to seek cover if they were driven in.Thus armies feel for
each other, stretching out first their sensitive fingers--the pickets.If
these recoil, the skirmishers are sent forward while the strong arm, the
line of battle, gathers itself to meet the foe.As this was an inner line,
it was more strongly fortified than was customary with the pickets.But
the men of both sides had become very expert in improvising field-works at
this stage of the war.Hard campaigning had taught the veterans the
importance to themselves of providing such protection, and no orders had
to be given for their construction.As soon as a regiment gained a
position desirable to hold, the soldiers would throw up a strong parapet
of dirt and logs in a single night.In order to spare the men as much as
possible, Sherman ordered his division commanders to organize pioneer
detachments out of the <DW64>s that escaped to the Federals.[Illustration: THE FINAL BLOW TO THE CONFEDERACY'S SOUTHERN STRONGHOLD

of Atlanta.In the picture the rails heating red-hot amid the flaming
bonfires of the ties, and the piles of twisted debris show vividly what
Sherman meant when he said their "work was done with a will."Sherman saw
that in order to take Atlanta without terrific loss he must cut off all
its rail communications.This he did by "taking the field with our main
force and using it against the communications of Atlanta instead of
against its intrenchments."On the night of August 25th he moved with
practically his entire army and wagon-trains loaded with fifteen days'
rations.By the morning of the 27th the whole front of the city was
deserted.The Confederates concluded that Sherman was in retreat.Next day
they found out their mistake, for the Federal army lay across the West
Point Railroad while the soldiers began wrecking it.Next day they were in
motion toward the railroad to Macon, and General Hood began to understand
that a colossal raid was in progress.After the occupation, when this
picture was taken, Sherman's men completed the work of destruction.[Illustration: THE RUIN OF HOOD'S RETREAT--DEMOLISHED CARS AND

Jonesboro and cut them off from returning to Atlanta.This was Hood's last
effort to save his communications.About midnight sounds of exploding
shells and what seemed like volleys of musketry arose in the direction of
Atlanta.Supplies and ammunition
that Hood could carry with him were being removed; large quantities of
provisions were being distributed among the citizens, and as the troops
marched out they were allowed to take what they could from the public
stores.The noise that Sherman heard that
night was the blowing up of the rolling-mill and of about a hundred cars
and six engines loaded with Hood's abandoned ammunition.The picture shows
the Georgia Central Railroad east of the town.REPRESENTATIVE SOLDIERS FROM A DOZEN STATES

[Illustration]

BLAIR, OF MISSOURI

Although remaining politically neutral throughout the war, Missouri
contributed four hundred and forty-seven separate military organizations
to the Federal armies, and over one hundred to the Confederacy.The Union
sentiment in the State is said to have been due to Frank P. Blair, who,
early in 1861, began organizing home guards.Blair subsequently joined
Grant's command and served with that leader until Sherman took the helm in
the West.With Sherman Major-General Blair fought in Georgia and through
the Carolinas.[Illustration]

BAKER, OF CALIFORNIA

California contributed twelve military organizations to the Federal
forces, but none of them took part in the campaigns east of the
Mississippi.Its Senator, Edward D. Baker, was in his place in Washington
when the war broke out, and, being a close friend of Lincoln, promptly
organized a regiment of Pennsylvanians which was best known by its synonym
"First California."Colonel Baker was killed at the head of it at the
battle of Ball's Bluff, Virginia, October 21, 1861.Baker had been
appointed brigadier-general but declined.[Illustration]

KELLEY, OF WEST VIRGINIA

West Virginia counties had already supplied soldiers for the Confederates
when the new State was organized in 1861.As early as May, 1861, Colonel
B. F. Kelley was in the field with the First West Virginia Infantry
marshalled under the Stars and Stripes.He served to the end of the war
and was brevetted major-general.West Virginia furnished thirty-seven
organizations of all arms to the Federal armies, chiefly for local defense
and for service in contiguous territory.General Kelley was prominent in
the Shenandoah campaigns.[Illustration]

SMYTH, OF DELAWARE

Little Delaware furnished to the Federal armies fifteen separate military
organizations.First in the field was Colonel Thomas A. Smyth, with the
First Delaware Infantry.Early promoted to the command of a brigade, he
led it at Gettysburg, where it received the full force of Pickett's charge
on Cemetery Ridge, July 3, 1863.He was brevetted major-general and fell
at Farmville, on Appomattox River, Va., April 7, 1865, two days before the
surrender at Appomattox.General Smyth was a noted leader in the Second
Corps.[Illustration]

MITCHELL, OF KANSAS

The virgin State of Kansas sent fifty regiments, battalions, and batteries
into the Federal camps.Its Second Infantry was organized and led to the
field by Colonel R. B. Mitchell, a veteran of the Mexican War.At the
first battle in the West, Wilson's Creek, Mo.(August 10, 1861), he was
wounded.At the battle of Perryville, Brigadier-General Mitchell commanded
a division in McCook's Corps and fought desperately to hold the Federal
left flank against a sudden and desperate assault by General Bragg's
Confederates.[Illustration]

CROSS, OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

New Hampshire supplied twenty-nine military organizations to the Federal
armies.To the Granite State belongs the grim distinction of furnishing
the regiment which had the heaviest mortality roll of any infantry
organization in the army.This was the Fifth New Hampshire, commanded by
Colonel E. E. Cross.The Fifth served in the Army of the Potomac.At

PEARCE, OF ARKANSAS

Arkansas entered into the war with enthusiasm, and had a large contingent
of Confederate troops ready for the field in the summer of 1861.At
Wilson's Creek, Missouri, August 10, 1861, there were four regiments and
two batteries of Arkansans under command of Brigadier-General N. B.
Pearce.Arkansas furnished seventy separate military organizations to the
Confederate armies and seventeen to the Federals.The State was gallantly
represented in the Army of Northern Virginia, notably at Antietam and
Gettysburg.[Illustration]

STEUART, OF MARYLAND

Maryland quickly responded to the Southern call to arms, and among its
first contribution of soldiers was George H. Steuart, who led a battalion
across the Potomac early in 1861.These Marylanders fought at First Bull
Run, or Manassas, and Lee's army at Petersburg included Maryland troops
under Brigadier-General Steuart.During the war this little border State,
politically neutral, sent six separate organizations to the Confederates
in Virginia, and mustered thirty-five for the Federal camps and for local
defense.[Illustration]

CRITTENDEN, THE CONFEDERATE

Kentucky is notable as a State which sent brothers to both the Federal and
Confederate armies.Major-General George B. Crittenden, C. S. A., was the
brother of Major-General Thomas L. Crittenden, U. S. A. Although remaining
politically neutral throughout the war, the Blue Grass State sent
forty-nine regiments, battalions, and batteries across the border to
uphold the Stars and Bars, and mustered eighty of all arms to battle
around the Stars and Stripes and protect the State from Confederate
incursions.[Illustration]

RANSOM, OF NORTH CAROLINA

The last of the Southern States to cast its fortunes in with the
Confederacy, North Carolina vied with the pioneers in the spirit with
which it entered the war.With the First North Carolina, Lieut.-Col.Matt
W. Ransom was on the firing-line early in 1861.Under his leadership as
brigadier-general, North Carolinians carried the Stars and Bars on all the
great battlefields of the Army of Northern Virginia.The State furnished
ninety organizations for the Confederate armies, and sent eight to the
Federal camps.[Illustration]

FINEGAN, OF FLORIDA

Florida was one of the first to follow South Carolina's example in
dissolving the Federal compact.It furnished twenty-one military
organizations to the Confederate forces, and throughout the war maintained
a vigorous home defense.Its foremost soldier to take the field when the
State was menaced by a strong Federal expedition in February, 1864, was
Brigadier-General Joseph Finegan.Hastily gathering scattered detachments,
he defeated and checked the expedition at the battle of Olustee, or Ocean
Pond, on February 20.[Illustration]

CLEBURNE, OF TENNESSEE

Cleburne was of foreign birth, but before the war was one year old he
became the leader of Tennesseeans, fighting heroically on Tennessee soil.At Shiloh, Cleburne's brigade, and at Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and
Franklin, Major-General P. R. Cleburne's division found the post of honor.At Franklin this gallant Irishman "The 'Stonewall' Jackson of the West,"
led Tennesseeans for the last time and fell close to the breastworks.Tennessee sent the Confederate armies 129 organizations, and the Federal
fifty-six.[Illustration: THE LAST OF THE FRIGATE._Painted by E. Packbauer._

THE LAST CONFLICTS IN THE SHENANDOAH

    Sheridan's operations were characterized not so much, as has been
    supposed, by any originality of method, as by a just appreciation of
    the proper manner of combining the two arms of infantry and cavalry.He constantly used his powerful body of horse, which under his
    disciplined hand attained a high degree of perfection, as an
    impenetrable mask behind which he screened the execution of maneuvers
    of infantry columns hurled with a mighty momentum on one of the
    enemy's flanks.--_William Swinton, in "Campaigns of the Army of the
    Potomac."_


On July 12, 1864, in the streets of Washington, there could be distinctly
heard the boom of cannon and the sharp firing of musketry.The old specter "threaten Washington," that for
three years had been a standing menace to the Federal authorities and a
"very present help" to the Confederates, now seemed to have come in the
flesh.The hopes of the South and the fears of the North were apparently
about to be realized.The occasion of this demonstration before the very gates of the city was
the result of General Lee's project to relieve the pressure on his own
army, by an invasion of the border States and a threatening attitude
toward the Union capital.The plan had worked well before, and Lee
believed it again would be effective.Grant was pushing him hard in front
of Petersburg.Accordingly, Lee despatched the daring soldier, General
Jubal A. Early, to carry the war again to the northward.He was to go by
the beautiful and fertile Shenandoah valley, that highway of the
Confederates along which the legions of the South had marched and
countermarched.On the 9th of July, the advance lines of the Confederate
force came to the banks of the Monocacy, where they found General Lew
Wallace posted, with eight thousand men, half of Early's numbers, on the
eastern side of that stream, to contest the approach of the Southern
troops.The battle was brief but bloody; the Confederates, crossing the stream and
climbing its slippery banks, hurled their lines of gray against the
compact ranks of blue.The attack was impetuous; the repulse was stubborn.A wail of musketry rent the air and the Northern soldiers fell back to
their second position.Between the opposing forces was a narrow ravine
through which flowed a small brook.Across this stream the tide of battle
rose and fell.Its limpid current was soon crimsoned by the blood of the
dead and wounded.Wallace's columns, as did those of Early, bled, but they
stood.The result of the battle for a time hung in the balance.The retreat began, some of the troops in
order but the greater portion in confusion, and the victorious
Confederates found again an open way to Washington.Now within half a dozen miles of the city, with the dome of the Capitol in
full view, the Southern general pushed his lines so close to Fort Stevens
that he was ready to train his forty pieces of artillery upon its walls.General Augur, in command of the capital's defenses, hastily collected
what strength in men and guns he could.Heavy artillery, militia, sailors
from the navy yard, convalescents, Government employees of all kinds were
rushed to the forts around the city.General Wright, with two divisions of
the Sixth Corps, arrived from the camp at Petersburg, and Emory's division
of the Nineteenth Corps came just in time from New Orleans.This was on
July 11th, the very day on which Early appeared in front of Fort Stevens.The Confederate had determined to make an assault, but the knowledge of
the arrival of Wright and Emory caused him to change his mind.He realized
that, if unsuccessful, his whole force would be lost, and he concluded to
return.Nevertheless, he spent the 12th of July in threatening the city.In the middle of the afternoon General Wright sent out General Wheaton
with Bidwell's brigade of Getty's division, and Early's pickets and
skirmishers were driven back a mile.Pond in "The
Shenandoah Valley" thus describes the scene: "On the parapet of Fort
Stevens stood the tall form of Abraham Lincoln by the side of General
Wright, who in vain warned the eager President that his position was swept
by the bullets of sharpshooters, until an officer was shot down within
three feet of him, when he reluctantly stepped below.Sheltered from the
line of fire, Cabinet officers and a group of citizens and ladies,
breathless with excitement, watched the fortunes of the flight."Under cover of night the Confederates began to retrace their steps and
made their way to the Shenandoah, with General Wright in pursuit.As the
Confederate army was crossing that stream, at Snicker's Ferry, on the
18th, the pursuing Federals came upon them.Early turned, repulsed them,
and continued on his way to Winchester, where General Averell, from
Hunter's forces, now at Harper's Ferry, attacked them with his cavalry and
took several hundred prisoners.The Federal authorities were looking for a "man of the hour"--one whom
they might pit against the able and strategic Early.Such a one was found
in General Philip Henry Sheridan, whom some have called the "Marshal Ney
of America."He was selected by General Grant, and his instructions were
to drive the Confederates out of the Valley once for all.The middle of September found the Confederate forces centered about
Winchester, and the Union army was ten miles distant, with the Opequon
between them.At two o'clock on the morning of September 19th, the Union
camp was in motion, preparing for marching orders.At three o'clock the
forward movement was begun, and by daylight the Federal advance had driven
in the Confederate pickets.Emptying into the Opequon from the west are
two converging streams, forming a triangle with the Winchester and
Martinsburg pike as a base.The town of Winchester is situated on this road, and was therefore at the
bottom of the triangle.Before the town, the Confederate army stretched
its lines between the two streams.The Union army would have to advance
from the apex of the triangle, through a narrow ravine, shut in by thickly
wooded hills and gradually emerging into an undulating valley.At the end
of the gorge was a Confederate outwork, guarding the approach to
Winchester.Both generals had the same plan of battle in mind.Sheridan
would strike the Confederate center and right.Early was willing he should
do this, for he planned to strike the Union right, double it back, get
between Sheridan's army and the gorge, and thus cut off its retreat.It took time for the Union troops to pass through the ravine, and it was
late in the forenoon before the line of battle was formed.The attack and
defense were alike obstinate.Upon the Sixth Corps and Grover's division
of the Nineteenth Corps fell the brunt of the battle, since they were to
hold the center while the Army of West Virginia, under General Crook,
would sweep around them and turn the position of the opposing forces.The
Confederate General Ramseur, with his troops, drove back the Federal
center, held his ground for two hours, while the opposing lines were swept
by musketry and artillery from the front, and enfiladed by artillery.By this time, Russell's division of the Sixth Corps emerged from the
ravine.Forming in two lines, it marched quickly to the front.About the
same time the Confederates were also being reenforced.General Rodes
plunged into the fight, making a gallant attack and losing his life.General Gordon, with his columns of gray, swept across the summit of the
hills and through the murky clouds of smoke saw the steady advance of the
lines of blue.One of Russell's brigades struck the Confederate flank, and
the Federal line was reestablished.As the division moved forward to do
this General Russell fell, pierced through the heart by a piece of shell.The Fifth Maine battery, galloping into the field, unlimbered and with an
enfilading storm of canister aided in turning the tide.Piece by piece the
shattered Union line was picked up and reunited.Early sent the last of
his reserves into the conflict to turn the Union right.Now ensued the
fiercest fighting of the day.Regiment after regiment advanced to the wood
only to be hurled back again.Here it was that the One hundred and
fourteenth New York left its dreadful toll of men.Its position after the
battle could be told by the long, straight line of one hundred and
eighty-five of its dead and wounded.It was three o'clock in the afternoon; the hour of Early's repulse had
struck.To the right of the Union lines could be heard a mighty yell.The
Confederates seemed to redouble their fire.The shivering lightning bolts
shot through the air and the volleys of musketry increased in intensity.Then, across the shell-plowed field, came the reserves under General
Crook.Breasting the Confederate torrent of lead, which cut down nine
hundred of the reserves while crossing the open space, they rushed toward
the embattled lines of the South.At the same moment, coming out of the woods in the rear of the Federals,
were seen the men of the Nineteenth Corps under General Emory, who had for
three hours been lying in the grass awaiting their opportunity.The
Confederate bullets had been falling thick in their midst with fatal
certainty.Rushing into the contest like
madmen, they stopped at nothing.From two sides of the wood the men of
Emory and Crook charged simultaneously.The Union line overlapped the
Confederate at every point and doubled around the unprotected flanks.The
day for the Southerners was irretrievably lost.They fell back toward
Winchester in confusion.As they did so, a great uproar was heard on the
pike road.It was the Federal cavalry under General Torbert sweeping up
the road, driving the Confederate troopers before them.The surprised mass
was pressed into its own lines.The infantry was charged and many
prisoners and battle-flags captured.The sun was now sinking upon the horizon, and on the ascending <DW72>s in
the direction of the town could be seen the long, dark lines of men
following at the heels of the routed army.Along the crest of the
embattled summit galloped a force of cavalrymen, which, falling upon the
disorganized regiments of Early, aided, in the language of Sheridan, "to
send them whirling through Winchester."The Union pursuit continued until
the twilight had come and the shadows of night screened the scattered
forces of Early from the pursuing cavalrymen.The battle of Winchester, or
the Opequon, had been a bloody one--a loss of five thousand on the Federal
side, and about four thousand on the Confederate.By daylight of the following morning the victorious army was again in
pursuit.On the afternoon of that day, it caught up with the Confederates,
who now turned at bay at Fisher's Hill to resist the further approach of
their pursuers.The position selected by General Early was a strong one,
and his antagonist at once recognized it as such.The valley of the
Shenandoah at this point is about four miles wide, lying between Fisher's
Hill and Little North Mountain.General Early's line extended across the
entire valley, and he had greatly increased his already naturally strong
position.From the summit of Three Top
Mountain, his signal corps informed him of every movement of the Union
army in the valley below.General Sheridan's actions indicated a purpose
to assault the center of the Confederate line.For two days he continued
massing his regiments in that direction, at times even skirmishing for
position.General Wright pushed his men to within seven hundred yards of
the Southern battle-line.While this was going on in full view of the
Confederate general and his army, another movement was being executed
which even the vigilant signal officers on Three Top Mountain had not
observed.On the night of September 20th, the troops of General Crook were moved
into the timber on the north bank of Cedar Creek.All during the next day,
they lay concealed.That night they crossed the stream and the next
morning were again hidden by the woods and ravines.At five o'clock on the
morning of the 22d, Crook's men were nearly opposite the Confederate
center.Marching his men in perfect silence, by one o'clock he had arrived
at the left and front of the unsuspecting Early.By four o'clock he had
reached the east face of Little North Mountain, to the left and rear of
the Confederates.While the movement was being made, the main body of the
Federal army was engaging the attention of the Confederates in front.Just
before sundown, Crook's men plunged down the mountain side, from out of
the timbered cover.The Confederates were quick to see that they had been
trapped.They had been caught in a pocket and there was nothing for them
to do except to retreat or surrender.They preferred the former, which
was, according to General Gordon, "first stubborn and slow, then rapid,
then--a rout."After the battle of Fisher's Hill the pursuit still continued.The
Confederate regiments re-formed, and at times would stop and contest the
approach of the advancing cavalrymen.By the time the Union infantry would
reach the place, the retreating army would have vanished.Torbert had been
sent down Luray Valley in pursuit of the Confederate cavalry, with the
hope of scattering it and seizing New Market in time to cut off the
Confederate retreat from Fisher's Hill.But at Milford, in a narrow gorge,
General Wickham held Torbert and prevented the fulfilment of his plan; and
General Early's whole force was able to escape.Day after day this
continued until Early had taken refuge in the Blue Ridge in front of
Brown's Gap.Sheridan in the mean time
had gone into camp at Harrisonburg, and for some time the two armies lay
watching each other.The Federals were having difficulty in holding their
lines of supply.With the Valley practically given up by Early, Sheridan was anxious to
stop here.He wrote to Grant, "I think the best policy will be to let the
burning of the crops in the Valley be the end of the campaign, and let
some of this army go somewhere else."Grant's consent to this plan reached him on October 5th, and the following
day he started on his return march down the Shenandoah.His cavalry
extended across the entire valley.With the unsparing severity of war, his
men began to make a barren waste of the region.The October sky was
overcast with clouds of smoke and sheets of flame from the burning barns
and mills.As the army of Sheridan proceeded down the Valley, the undaunted cavaliers
of Early came in pursuit.His horsemen kept close to the rear of the Union
columns.On the morning of October 9th, the cavalry leader, Rosser, who
had succeeded Wickham, found himself confronted by General Custer's
division, at Tom's Brook.At the same time the Federal general, Wesley
Merritt, fell upon the cavalry of Lomax and Johnson on an adjacent road.The two Union forces were soon united and a mounted battle ensued.The
ground being level, the maneuvering of the squadrons was easy.The clink
of the sabers rang out in the morning air.The Confederate center held together, but its flanks gave way.The Federals charged along the whole front, with a momentum that forced
the Southern cavalrymen to flee from the field.They left in the hands of
the Federal troopers over three hundred prisoners, all their artillery,
except one piece, and nearly every wagon the Confederate cavalry had with
them.The Northern army continued its retrograde movement, and on the 10th
crossed to the north side of Cedar Creek.Early's army in the mean time
had taken a position at the wooded base of Fisher's Hill, four miles
away.The Sixth Corps started for Washington, but the news of Early at
Fisher's Hill led to its recall.The Union forces occupied ground that was
considered practically unassailable, especially on the left, where the
deep gorge of the Shenandoah, along whose front rose the bold Massanutten
Mountain, gave it natural protection.The movements of the Confederate army were screened by the wooded ravines
in front of Fisher's Hill, while, from the summit of the neighboring Three
Top Mountain, its officers could view, as in a panorama, the entire Union
camp.Seemingly secure, the corps of Crook on the left of the Union line
was not well protected.The keen-eyed Gordon saw the weak point in the
Union position.Ingenious plans to break it down were quickly made.Meanwhile, Sheridan was summoned to Washington to consult with Secretary
Stanton.He did not believe that Early proposed an immediate attack, and
started on the 15th, escorted by the cavalry, and leaving General Wright
in command.At Front Royal the next day word came from Wright enclosing a
message taken for the Confederate signal-flag on Three Top Mountain.It
was from Longstreet, advising Early that he would join him and crush
Sheridan.The latter sent the cavalry back to Wright, and continued on to
Washington, whence he returned at once by special train, reaching
Winchester on the evening of the 18th.Just after dark on October 18th, a part of Early's army under the command
of General John B. Gordon, with noiseless steps, moved out from their
camp, through the misty, autumn night.The men had been stripped of their
canteens, in fear that the striking of them against some object might
reveal their movements.Their path
followed along the base of the mountain--a dim and narrow trail, upon
which but one man might pass at a time.For seven miles this sinuous line
made its way through the dark gorge, crossing the Shenandoah, and at
times passing within four hundred yards of the Union pickets.It arrived at the appointed place, opposite Crook's camp on the Federal
right, an hour before the attack was to be made.In the shivering air of
the early morning, the men crouched on the river bank, waiting for the
coming of the order to move forward.At last, at five o'clock, it came.They plunged into the frosty water of the river, emerged on the other
side, marched in "double quick," and were soon sounding a reveille to the
sleeping troops of Sheridan.The minie balls whizzed and sang through the
tents.In the gray mists of the dawn the legions of the South looked like
phantom warriors, as they poured through the unmanned gaps.The
Northerners sprang to arms.Their eyes saw the flames from the Southern muskets; the men felt the
breath of the hot muzzles in their faces, while the Confederate bayonets
were at their breasts.There was a brief struggle, then panic and
disorganization.Only a quarter of an hour of this yelling and struggling,
and two-thirds of the Union army broke like a mill-dam and poured across
the fields, leaving their accouterments of war and the stiffening bodies
of their comrades.Rosser, with the cavalry, attacked Custer and assisted
Gordon.Meanwhile, during these same early morning hours, General Early had
himself advanced to Cedar Creek by a more direct route.At half-past three
o'clock his men had come in sight of the Union camp-fires.They waited
under cover for the approach of day.At the first blush of dawn and before
the charge of Gordon, Early hurled his men across the stream, swept over
the breastworks, captured the batteries and turned them upon the
unsuspecting Northerners.The Federal generals tried to stem the impending
disaster.From the east of the battlefield the solid lines of Gordon were
now driving the fugitives of Crook's corps by the mere force of momentum.Aides were darting hither and thither, trying to reassemble the crumbling
lines.The Nineteenth Corps, under Emory, tried to hold its ground; for a
time it fought alone, but after a desperate effort to hold its own, it,
too, melted away under the scorching fire.The fields to the rear of the
army were covered with wagons, ambulances, stragglers, and fleeing
soldiers.As it slowly fell to the rear it
would, at times, turn to fight.At last it found a place where it again
stood at bay.The men hastily gathered rails and constructed rude
field-works.At the same time the Confederates paused in their advance.There was scarcely any firing except for
the occasional roar of a long-range artillery gun.The Southerners seemed
willing to rest on their well-earned laurels of the morning.In the
language of the successful commander, it was "glory enough for one day."But the brilliant morning victory was about to be changed to a singular
afternoon defeat.During the morning's fight, when the Union troops were
being rapidly overwhelmed with panic, Rienzi, the beautiful jet-black
war-charger, was bearing his master, the commander of the Federal army, to
the field of disaster.Along the broad valley highway that leads from
Winchester, General Sheridan had galloped to where his embattled lines had
been reduced to a flying mob.While riding leisurely away from Winchester
about nine o'clock he had heard unmistakable thunder-peals of artillery.Realizing that a battle was on in the front, he hastened forward, soon to
be met, as he crossed Mill Creek, by the trains and men of his routed
army, coming to the rear with appalling rapidity.News from the field told him of the crushing defeat of his hitherto
invincible regiments.The road was blocked by the retreating crowds as
they pressed toward the rear.The commander was forced to take to the
fields, and as his steed, flecked with foam, bore him onward, the
disheartened refugees greeted him with cheers.Taking off his hat as he
rode, he cried, "We will go back and recover our camps."The words seemed
to inspire the demoralized soldiers.Stragglers fell into line behind him;
men turned to follow their magnetic leader back to the fight.Vaulting his horse over the low barricade of rails, he dashed to the crest
of the field.There was a flutter along the battle-line.The men from
behind their protecting wall broke into thunderous cheers.From the rear
of the soldiers there suddenly arose, as from the earth, a line of the
regimental flags, which waved recognition to their leader.Early made another assault
after one o'clock, but was easily repulsed.It was nearly four o'clock when the order for the Federal advance was
given.General Sheridan, hat in hand, rode in front of his infantry line
that his men might see him.The Confederate forces now occupied a series
of wooded crests.From out of the shadow of one of these timbered coverts,
a column of gray was emerging.The Union lines stood waiting for the
impending crash.It came in a devouring succession of volleys that
reverberated into a deep and sullen roar.The Union infantry rose as one
man and passed in among the trees.Then, suddenly,
there came a screaming, humming rush of shell, a roar of musketry mingling
with the yells of a successful charge.Again the firing ceased, except for
occasional outbursts.The Confederates had taken a new position and
reopened with a galling fire.General Sheridan dashed along the front of
his lines in personal charge of the attack.Again his men moved toward the
lines of Early's fast thinning ranks.The Union
cavalry swept in behind the fleeing troops of Early and sent, again, his
veteran army "whirling up the Valley."The battle of Cedar Creek was ended; the tumult died away.The Federal
loss had been about fifty-seven hundred; the Confederate over three
thousand.Fourteen hundred Union prisoners were sent to Richmond.Never
again would the gaunt specter of war hover over Washington.[Illustration: GENERAL JUBAL A. EARLY, THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER WHO

years of age when he made the brilliant Valley campaign of the summer of
1864, which was halted only by the superior forces of Sheridan.A West
Point graduate and a veteran of the Mexican War, Early became, after the
death of Jackson, one of Lee's most efficient subordinates.He was alert,
aggressive, resourceful.His very eccentricities, perhaps, made him all
the more successful as a commander of troops in the field."Old Jube's"
caustic wit and austere ways made him a terror to stragglers, and who

it was still an unfinished structure, betraying its incompleteness to
every beholder.This picture shows the derrick on the dome.It is a view
of the east front of the building and was taken on July 11, 1863.Washington society had not been wholly free from occasional "war scares"
since the withdrawal of most of the troops whose duty it had been to guard
the city.Early's approach in July, 1864, found the Nation's capital
entirely unprotected.Naturally there was a flutter throughout the
peaceable groups of non-combatants that made up the population of
Washington at that time, as well as in official circles.There were less
than seventy thousand people living in the city in 1864, a large
proportion of whom were in some way connected with the Government.[Illustration: PROTECTING LOCOMOTIVES FROM THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER

such an attack as Early might be expected to make.Not only were these
guns hard to move to points of danger, but in the summer of '64 there were
no trained artillerists to man them.Big as they were, they gave Early no
occasion for alarm.[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO WASHINGTON FROM THE SOUTH--THE FAMOUS "CHAIN
BRIDGE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The sentry and vedette guarding the approach to Washington suggest one
reason why Early did not make his approach to the capital from the
Virginia side of the Potomac.A chain of more than twenty forts protected
the roads to Long Bridge (shown below), and there was no way of marching
troops into the city from the south, excepting over such exposed passages.Most of the troops left for the defense of the city were on the Virginia
side.Therefore Early wisely picked out the northern outposts as the more
vulnerable.Long Bridge was closely guarded at all times, like Chain
Bridge and the other approaches, and at night the planks of its floor were
removed.[Illustration: LONG BRIDGE AND THE CAPITOL ACROSS THE BROAD POTOMAC

INSIDE FORT TOTTEN--THREE SHIFTING SCENES IN A BIG-GUN DRILL

Constant drill at the guns went on in the defenses of Washington
throughout the war.At its close in April, 1865, there were 68 enclosed
forts and batteries, whose aggregate perimeter was thirteen miles, 807
guns and 98 mortars mounted, and emplacements for 1,120 guns, ninety-three
unarmed batteries for field-guns, 35,711 yards of rifle-trenches, and
three block-houses encircling the Northern capital.The entire extent of
front of the lines was thirty-seven miles; and thirty-two miles of
military roads, besides those previously existing in the District of
Columbia, formed the means of interior communication.In all these forts
constant preparation was made for a possible onslaught of the
Confederates, and many of the troops were trained which later went to take
part in the siege of Petersburg where the heavy artillery fought bravely
as infantry.[Illustration]

ramparts, and a surgeon who stood by his side was wounded.These works
were feebly garrisoned, and General Gordon declared in his memoirs that

time a realizing sense of immediate danger.This scene is the neighborhood
of Fort Stevens, on the Seventh Street road, not far from the Soldiers'
Home, where President Lincoln was spending the summer.The campaign for
his reelection had begun and the outlook for his success and that of his
party seemed at this moment as dubious as that for the conclusion of the
war.Grant had weakened his lines about Richmond in order to protect
Washington, while Lee had been able to detach Early's Corps for the
brilliant Valley Campaign, which saved his Shenandoah supplies.[Illustration: GENERAL SHERIDAN'S "WINCHESTER"

After the disastrous clash of the two armies at Cold Harbor, Grant
remained a few days in his entrenchments trying in vain to find a weak
place in Lee's lines.The combatants were now due east of Richmond, and
the Federal general realized that it would be impossible at this time to
attain the object for which he had struggled ever since he crossed the
Rapidan on the 4th of May--to turn Lee's right flank and interpose his
forces between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.His opponent, one of the very greatest military leaders the
Anglo-Saxon race has produced, with an army of but little more than half
the number of the Federal host, had successfully blocked the attempts to
carry out this plan in three great battles and by a remarkable maneuver on
the southern bank of the North Anna, which had forced Grant to recross the
river and which will always remain a subject of curious interest to
students of the art of war.In one month the Union army had lost fifty-five thousand men, while the
Confederate losses had been comparatively small.The cost to the North had
been too great; Lee could not be cut off from his capital, and the most
feasible project was now to join in the move which heretofore had been the
special object of General Butler and the Army of the James, and attack
Richmond itself.South of the city, at a distance of twenty-one miles, was
the town of Petersburg.Its defenses were not strong, although General
Gillmore of Butler's army had failed in an attempt to seize them on the
10th of June.Three railroads converged here and these were main arteries
of Lee's supply.He sent
General W. F. Smith, who had come to his aid at Cold Harbor with the
flower of the Army of the James, back to Bermuda Hundred by water, as he
had come, with instructions to hasten to Petersburg before Lee could get
there.Smith arrived on the 15th and was joined by Hancock with the first
troops of the Army of the Potomac to appear, but the attack was not
pressed and Beauregard who, with only two thousand men, was in desperate
straits until Lee should reach him, managed to hold the inner line of
trenches.The last of Grant's forces were across the James by midnight of June 16th,
while Lee took a more westerly and shorter route to Petersburg.The
fighting there was continued as the two armies came up, but each Union
attack was successfully repulsed.At the close of day on the 18th both
opponents were in full strength and the greatest struggle of modern times
was begun.Impregnable bastioned works began to show themselves around
Petersburg.More than thirty miles of frowning redoubts connected
extensive breastworks and were strengthened by mortar batteries and
field-works which lined the fields near the Appomattox River.It was a
vast net of fortifications, but there was no formal siege of Lee's
position, which was a new entrenched line selected by Beauregard some
distance behind the rifle-pits where he had held out at such great odds
against Hancock and Smith.Grant, as soon as the army was safely protected, started to extend his
lines on the west and south, in order to envelop the Confederate right
flank.He also bent his energies to destroying the railroads upon which
Lee depended for supplies.On
June 22d two corps of the Union army set out for the Weldon Railroad, but
they became separated and were put to flight by A. P. Hill.The Federal
cavalry also joined in the work, but the vigilant Confederate horsemen
under W. H. F. Lee prevented any serious damage to the iron way, and by
July 2d the last of the raiders were back in the Federal lines, much the
worse for the rough treatment they had received.Now ensued some weeks of quiet during which both armies were
strengthening their fortifications.On June 25th Sheridan returned from
his cavalry raid on the Virginia Central Railroad running north from
Richmond.He had encountered Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee at Trevilian Station
on June 11th, and turned back after doing great damage to the railway.Ammunition was running short and he did not dare risk another engagement.Sheridan was destined not to remain long with the army in front of
Petersburg.Lee had detached a corps from his forces and, under Early, it
had been doing great damage in Maryland and Pennsylvania.So Grant's
cavalry leader was put at the head of an army and sent to the Shenandoah
valley to drive Early's troops from the base of their operations.Meanwhile the Federals were covertly engaged in an undertaking which was
fated to result in conspicuous failure.Some skilled miners from the upper
Schuylkill coal regions in the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania attached to the
Ninth Corps were boring a tunnel from the rear of the Union works
underneath the Confederate fortifications.Eight thousand pounds of
gunpowder were placed in lateral galleries at the end of the tunnel.At
twenty minutes to five on the morning of July 30th, the mine was exploded.A solid mass of earth and all manner of material shot two hundred feet
into the air.Three hundred human beings were buried in the debris as it
fell back into the gaping crater.The smoke had barely cleared away when
General Ledlie led his waiting troops into the vast opening.The horror of
the sight sickened the assailants, and in crowding into the pit they
became completely demoralized.In the confusion officers lost power to
reorganize, much less to control, their troops.The stunned and paralyzed Confederates were not long in recovering their
wits.Batteries opened upon the approach to the crater, and presently a
stream of fire was poured into the pit itself.General Mahone hastened up
with his Georgia and Virginia troops, and there were several desperate
charges before the Federals withdrew at Burnside's order.Grant had had
great expectations that the mine would result in his capturing Petersburg
and he was much disappointed.In order to get a part of Lee's army away
from the scene of what he hoped would be the final struggle, Hancock's
troops and a large force of cavalry had been sent north of the James, as
if a move on Richmond had been planned.In the mine fiasco on that fatal
July 30th, thirty-nine hundred men (nearly all from Burnside's corps) were
lost to the Union side.In the torrid days of mid-August Grant renewed his attacks upon the Weldon
Railroad, and General Warren was sent to capture it.He reached Globe
Tavern, about four miles from Petersburg, when he encountered General
Heth, who drove him back.Warren did not return to the Federal lines but
entrenched along the iron way.The next day he was fiercely attacked by
the Confederate force now strongly reenforced by Mahone.Mahone forced his way through the skirmish line and then
turned and fought his opponents from their rear.Another of his divisions
struck the Union right wing.In this extremity two thousand of Warren's
troops were captured and all would have been lost but for the timely
arrival of Burnside's men.Two days later the Southerners renewed the battle and now thirty cannon
poured volley after volley upon the Fifth and Ninth corps.The dashing
Mahone again came forward with his usual impetuousness, but the blue line
finally drove Lee's men back.And so the Weldon Railroad fell into the
hands of General Grant.Hancock, with the Second Corps, returned from the
north bank of the James and set to work to assist in destroying the
railway, whose loss was a hard blow to General Lee.It was not to be
expected that the latter would permit this work to continue unmolested and
on the 25th of August, A. P. Hill suddenly confronted Hancock, who
entrenched himself in haste at Ream's Station.This did not save the
Second Corps, which for the first time in its glorious career was put to
rout.Their very guns were captured and turned upon them.In the following weeks there were no actions of importance except that in
the last days of September Generals Ord and Birney, with the Army of the
James, captured Fort Harrison, on the north bank of that river, from
Generals Ewell and Anderson.The Federals were anxious to have it, since
it was an excellent vantage point from which to threaten Richmond.Meanwhile Grant was constantly extending his line to the west and by the
end of October it was very close to the South Side Railroad.On the 27th
there was a hard fight at Hatcher's Run, but the Confederates saved the
railway and the Federals returned to their entrenchments in front of
Petersburg.The active struggle now ceased, but Lee found himself each day in more
desperate straits.Sheridan had played sad havoc with such sources of
supply as existed in the rich country to the northwest.The Weldon
Railroad was gone and the South Side line was in imminent danger.Many went home for the winter on a promise
to return when the spring planting was done.Lee was loath to let them go,
but he could ill afford to maintain them, and the very life of their
families depended upon it.Those who remained at Petersburg suffered
cruelly from hunger and cold.They looked forward to the spring, although
it meant renewal of the mighty struggle.The Confederate line had been
stretched to oppose Grant's westward progress until it had become the
thinnest of screens.A man lost to Lee was almost impossible to replace,
while the bounties offered in the North kept Grant's ranks full.[Illustration: MAHONE, "THE HERO OF THE CRATER"

of General Mahone that the Southerners, on July 30, 1864, were enabled to
turn back upon the Federals the disaster threatened by the hidden mine.On
the morning of the explosion there were but eighteen thousand Confederates
left to hold the ten miles of lines about Petersburg.Everything seemed to
favor Grant's plans for the crushing of this force.Immediately after the
mine was sprung, a terrific cannonade was opened from one hundred and
fifty guns and mortars to drive back the Confederates from the breach,
while fifty thousand Federals stood ready to charge upon the
panic-stricken foe.But the foe was not panic-stricken long.Colonel
McMaster, of the Seventeenth South Carolina, gathered the remnants of
General Elliott's brigade and held back the Federals massing at the Crater
until General Mahone arrived at the head of three brigades.At once he
prepared to attack the Federals, who at that moment were advancing to the
left of the Crater.In his inspiring
presence it swept with such vigor that the Federals were driven back and
dared not risk another assault.At the Crater, Lee had what Grant
lacked--a man able to direct the entire engagement.[Illustration: WHAT EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS OF POWDER DID

great mass of earth hurled skyward like a water-spout.As it spread out
into an immense cloud, scattering guns, carriages, timbers, and what were
once human beings, the front ranks broke in panic; it looked as if the
mass were descending upon their own heads.The men were quickly rallied;
across the narrow plain they charged, through the awful breach, and up the
heights beyond to gain Cemetery Ridge.But there were brave fighters on
the other side still left, and delay among the Federals enabled the
Confederates to rally and re-form in time to drive the Federals back down
the steep sides of the Crater.There, as they struggled amidst the
horrible debris, one disaster after another fell upon them.Huddled
together, the mass of men was cut to pieces by the canister poured upon
them from well-planted Confederate batteries.At last, as a forlorn hope,
the <DW52> troops were sent forward; and they, too, were hurled back into
the Crater and piled upon their white comrades.[Illustration: FORT MAHONE--"FORT DAMNATION"

opposite the Federal Fort Sedgwick at the point where the hostile lines

while Fort Sedgwick, which was no less active in reply, was known to the
Confederates as Fort Hell.Gracie's salient, further north on the
Confederate line, is notable as the point in front of which General John

desperate effort of the Confederates to break through the Federal cordon.The views of Gracie's salient show the French form of chevaux-de-frise, a

SHERMAN'S FINAL CAMPAIGNS

    I only regarded the march from Atlanta to Savannah as a "shift of
    base," as the transfer of a strong army, which had no opponent, and
    had finished its then work, from the interior to a point on the sea
    coast, from which it could achieve other important results.I
    considered this march as a means to an end, and not as an essential
    act of war.Still, then as now, the march to the sea was generally
    regarded as something extraordinary, something anomalous, something
    out of the usual order of events; whereas, in fact, I simply moved
    from Atlanta to Savannah, as one step in the direction of Richmond, a
    movement that had to be met and defeated, or the war was necessarily
    at an end.--_General W. T. Sherman, in his "Memoirs."_


The march to the sea, in which General William T. Sherman won undying fame
in the Civil War, is one of the greatest pageants in the world's
warfare--as fearful in its destruction as it is historic in its import.But this was not Sherman's chief achievement; it was an easy task compared
with the great campaign between Chattanooga and Atlanta through which he
had just passed."As a military accomplishment it was little more than a
grand picnic," declared one of his division commanders, in speaking of the
march through Georgia and the Carolinas.Almost immediately after the capture of Atlanta, Sherman, deciding to
remain there for some time and to make it a Federal military center,
ordered all the inhabitants to be removed.General Hood pronounced the act
one of ingenious cruelty, transcending any that had ever before come to
his notice in the dark history of the war.Sherman insisted that his act
was one of kindness, and that Johnston and Hood themselves had done the
same--removed families from their homes--in other places.Many of the people of Atlanta chose to go southward,
others to the north, the latter being transported free, by Sherman's
order, as far as Chattanooga.Shortly after the middle of September, Hood moved his army from Lovejoy's
Station, just south of Atlanta, to the vicinity of Macon.Here Jefferson
Davis visited the encampment, and on the 22d he made a speech to the
homesick Army of Tennessee, which, reported in the Southern newspapers,
disclosed to Sherman the new plans of the Confederate leaders.These
involved nothing less than a fresh invasion of Tennessee, which, in the
opinion of President Davis, would put Sherman in a predicament worse than
that in which Napoleon found himself at Moscow.But, forewarned, the
Federal leader prepared to thwart his antagonists.The line of the Western
and Atlantic Railroad was more closely guarded.Divisions were sent to
Rome and to Chattanooga.Thomas was ordered to Nashville, and Schofield to
Knoxville.Recruits were hastened from the North to these points, in order
that Sherman himself might not be weakened by the return of too many
troops to these places.Hood, in the hope of leading Sherman away from Atlanta, crossed the
Chattahoochee on the 1st of October, destroyed the railroad above Marietta
and sent General French against Allatoona.It was the brave defense of
this place by General John M. Corse that brought forth Sherman's famous
message, "Hold out; relief is coming," sent by his signal officers from
the heights of Kenesaw Mountain, and which thrilled the North and inspired
its poets to eulogize Corse's bravery in verse.Corse had been ordered
from Rome to Allatoona by signals from mountain to mountain, over the
heads of the Confederate troops, who occupied the valley between.Reaching
the mountain pass soon after midnight, on October 5th, Corse added his
thousand men to the nine hundred already there, and soon after daylight
the battle began.General French, in command of the Confederates, first
summoned Corse to surrender, and, receiving a defiant answer, opened with
his guns.Nearly all the day the fire was terrific from besieged and
besiegers, and the losses on both sides were very heavy.During the battle Sherman was on Kenesaw Mountain, eighteen miles away,
from which he could see the cloud of smoke and hear the faint
reverberation of the cannons' boom.When he learned by signal that Corse
was there and in command, he said, "If Corse is there, he will hold out; I
know the man."And he did hold out, and saved the stores at Allatoona, at
a loss of seven hundred of his men, he himself being among the wounded,
while French lost about eight hundred.General Hood continued to move northward to Resaca and Dalton, passing
over the same ground on which the two great armies had fought during the
spring and summer.He destroyed the railroads, burned the ties, and
twisted the rails, leaving greater havoc, if possible, in a country that
was already a wilderness of desolation.For some weeks Sherman followed
Hood in the hope that a general engagement would result.He went on to the banks of the Tennessee opposite
Florence, Alabama.His army was lightly equipped, and Sherman, with his
heavily burdened troops, was unable to catch him.Sherman halted at
Gaylesville and ordered Schofield, with the Twenty-third Corps, and
Stanley, with the Fourth Corps, to Thomas at Nashville.Sherman thereupon determined to return to Atlanta, leaving General Thomas
to meet Hood's appearance in Tennessee.It was about this time that
Sherman fully decided to march to the sea.Some time before this he had
telegraphed to Grant: "Hood... can constantly break my roads.I would
infinitely prefer to make a wreck of the road... send back all my wounded
and worthless, and, with my effective army, move through Georgia, smashing
things to the sea."Grant thought it best for Sherman to destroy Hood's
army first, but Sherman insisted that his plan would put him on the
offensive rather than the defensive.He also believed that Hood would be
forced to follow him.Grant was finally won to the view that if Hood moved
on Tennessee, Thomas would be able to check him.He had, on the 11th of
October, given permission for the march.Now, on the 2d of November, he
telegraphed Sherman at Rome: "I do not really see that you can withdraw
from where you are to follow Hood without giving up all we have gained in
territory.I say, then, go on as you propose."It was Sherman, and not
Grant or Lincoln, that conceived the great march, and while the march
itself was not seriously opposed or difficult to carry out, the conception
and purpose were masterly.Sherman moved his army by slow and easy stages back to Atlanta.He sent
the vast army stores that had collected at Atlanta, which he could not
take with him, as well as his sick and wounded, to Chattanooga, destroyed
the railroad to that place, also the machine-shops at Rome and other
places, and on November 12th, after receiving a final despatch from Thomas
and answering simply, "Despatch received--all right," the last telegraph
line was severed, and Sherman had deliberately cut himself off from all
communication with the Northern States.There is no incident like it in
the annals of war.A strange event it was, as Sherman observes in his
memoirs."Two hostile armies marching in opposite directions, each in the
full belief that it was achieving a final and conclusive result in a great
war."For the next two days all was astir in Atlanta.The great depot,
round-house, and machine-shops were destroyed.Walls were battered down;
chimneys pulled over; machinery smashed to pieces, and boilers punched
full of holes.Heaps of rubbish covered the spots where these fine
buildings had stood, and on the night of November 15th the vast debris was
set on fire.The torch was also applied to many places in the business
part of the city, in defiance of the strict orders of Captain Poe, who
had the work of destruction in charge.The court-house and a large part of
the dwellings escaped the flames.Preparations for the great march were made with extreme care.Defective
wagons and horses were discarded; the number of heavy guns to be carried
along was sixty-five, the remainder having been sent to Chattanooga.The
marching army numbered about sixty thousand, five thousand of whom
belonged to the cavalry and eighteen hundred to the artillery.The army
was divided into two immense wings, the Right, the Army of the Tennessee,
commanded by General O. O. Howard, and consisting of the Fifteenth and
Seventeenth corps, and the Left, the Army of Georgia, by General Henry W.
Slocum, composed the Fourteenth and Twentieth corps.There were twenty-five hundred wagons, each drawn by
six mules; six hundred ambulances, with two horses each, while the heavy
guns, caissons, and forges were each drawn by eight horses.A twenty days'
supply of bread, forty of coffee, sugar, and salt was carried with the
army, and a large herd of cattle was driven on foot.In Sherman's general instructions it was provided that the army should
march by four roads as nearly parallel as possible, except the cavalry,
which remained under the direct control of the general commanding.The
army was directed "to forage liberally on the country," but, except along
the roadside, this was to be done by organized foraging parties appointed
by the brigade commanders.Orders were issued forbidding soldiers to enter
private dwellings or to commit any trespass.The corps commanders were
given the option of destroying mills, cotton-gins, and the like, and where
the army was molested in its march by the burning of bridges, obstructing
the roads, and so forth, the devastation should be made "more or less
relentless, according to the measure of such hostility."The cavalry and
artillery and the foraging parties were permitted to take horses, mules,
and wagons from the inhabitants without limit, except that they were to
discriminate in favor of the poor.It was a remarkable military
undertaking, in which it was intended to remove restrictions only to a
sufficient extent to meet the requirements of the march.The cavalry was
commanded by General Judson Kilpatrick, who, after receiving a severe
wound at Resaca, in May, had gone to his home on the banks of the Hudson,
in New York, to recuperate, and, against the advice of his physician, had
joined the army again at Atlanta.On November 15th, most of the great army was started on its march, Sherman
himself riding out from the city next morning.As he rode near the spot
where General McPherson had fallen, he paused and looked back at the
receding city with its smoking ruins, its blackened walls, and its lonely,
tenantless houses.The vision of the desperate battles, of the hope and
fear of the past few months, rose before him, as he tells us, "like the
memory of a dream."The day was as perfect as Nature ever gives.They sang and shouted and waved their banners in the
autumn breeze.Most of them supposed they were going directly toward
Richmond, nearly a thousand miles away.As Sherman rode past them they
would call out, "Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at
Richmond."Only the commanders of the wings and Kilpatrick were entrusted
with the secret of Sherman's intentions.But even Sherman was not fully
decided as to his objective--Savannah, Georgia, or Port Royal, South
Carolina--until well on the march.There was one certainty, however--he was fully decided to keep the
Confederates in suspense as to his intentions.To do this the more
effectually he divided his army at the start, Howard leading his wing to
Gordon by way of McDonough as if to threaten Macon, while Slocum proceeded
to Covington and Madison, with Milledgeville as his goal.Both were
secretly instructed to halt, seven days after starting, at Gordon and
Milledgeville, the latter the capital of Georgia, about a hundred miles to
the southeast.General Hood and General Beauregard, who had come from the East to assist
him, were in Tennessee, and it was some days after Sherman had left
Atlanta that they heard of his movements.They realized that to follow him
would now be futile.He was nearly three hundred miles away, and not only
were the railroads destroyed, but a large part of the intervening country
was utterly laid waste and incapable of supporting an army.The
Confederates thereupon turned their attention to Thomas, who was also in
Tennessee, and was the barrier between Hood and the Northern States.General Sherman accompanied first one corps of his army and then another.The first few days he spent with Davis' corps of Slocum's wing.When they
reached Covington, the <DW64>s met the troops in great numbers, shouting
and thanking the Lord that "deliverance" had come at last.As Sherman rode
along the streets they would gather around his horse and exhibit every
evidence of adoration.The foraging parties consisted of companies of fifty men.Their route for
the day in which they obtained supplies was usually parallel to that of
the army, five or six miles from it.They would start out before daylight
in the morning, many of them on foot; but when they rejoined the column in
the evening they were no longer afoot.They were astride mules, horses, in
family carriages, farm wagons, and mule carts, which they packed with
hams, bacon, vegetables, chickens, ducks, and every imaginable product of
a Southern farm that could be useful to an army.In the general orders, Sherman had forbidden the soldiers to enter private
houses; but the order was not strictly adhered to, as many Southern people
have since testified.Sherman declares in his memoirs that these acts of
pillage and violence were exceptional and incidental.On one occasion
Sherman saw a man with a ham on his musket, a jug of molasses under his
arm, and a big piece of honey in his hand.As the man saw that he was
observed by the commander, he quoted audibly to a comrade, from the
general order, "forage liberally on the country."But the general reproved
him and explained that foraging must be carried on only by regularly
designated parties.It is a part of military history that Sherman's sole purpose was to weaken
the Confederacy by recognized means of honorable warfare; but it cannot be
denied that there were a great many instances, unknown to him,
undoubtedly, of cowardly hold-ups of the helpless inhabitants, or
ransacking of private boxes and drawers in search of jewelry and other
family treasure.This is one of the misfortunes of war--one of war's
injustices.Such practices always exist even under the most rigid
discipline in great armies, and the jubilation of this march was such that
human nature asserted itself in the license of warfare more than on most
other occasions.General Washington met with similar situations in the
American Revolution.The practice is never confined to either army in
warfare.Opposed to Sherman were Wheeler's cavalry, and a large portion of the
Georgia State troops which were turned over by General G. W. Smith to
General Howell Cobb.Kilpatrick and his horsemen, proceeding toward Macon,
were confronted by Wheeler and Cobb, but the Federal troopers drove them
back into the town.However, they issued forth again, and on November 21st
there was a sharp engagement with Kilpatrick at Griswoldville.The
following day the Confederates were definitely checked and retreated.The night of November 22d, Sherman spent in the home of General Cobb, who
had been a member of the United States Congress and of Buchanan's Cabinet.Thousands of soldiers encamped that night on Cobb's plantation, using his
fences for camp-fire fuel.By Sherman's order, everything on the
plantation movable or destructible was carried away next day, or
destroyed.By the next night both corps of the Left Wing were at Milledgeville, and
on the 24th started for Sandersville.Howard's wing was at Gordon, and it
left there on the day that Slocum moved from Milledgeville for Irwin's
Crossroads.A hundred miles below Milledgeville was a place called Millen,
and here were many Federal prisoners which Sherman greatly desired to
release.With this in view he sent Kilpatrick toward Augusta to give the
impression that the army was marching thither, lest the Confederates
should remove the prisoners from Millen.Kilpatrick had reached Waynesboro
when he learned that the prisoners had been taken away.Here he again
encountered the Confederate cavalry under General Wheeler.A sharp fight
ensued and Kilpatrick drove Wheeler through the town toward Augusta.As
there was no further need of making a feint on Augusta, Kilpatrick turned
back toward the Left Wing.Wheeler quickly followed and at Thomas' Station
nearly surrounded him, but Kilpatrick cut his way out.Wheeler still
pressed on and Kilpatrick chose a good position at Buck Head Creek,
dismounted, and threw up breastworks.Wheeler attacked desperately, but
was repulsed, and Kilpatrick, after being reenforced by a brigade from
Davis' corps, joined the Left Wing at Louisville.On the whole, the great march was but little disturbed by the
Confederates.The Georgia militia, probably ten thousand in all, did what
they could to defend their homes and their firesides; but their endeavors
were futile against the vast hosts that were sweeping through the country.In the skirmishes that took place between Atlanta and the sea the militia
was soon brushed aside.Even their destroying of bridges and supplies in
front of the invading army checked its progress but for a moment, as it
was prepared for every such emergency.Wheeler, with his cavalry, caused
more trouble, and engaged Kilpatrick's attention a large part of the time.But even he did not seriously <DW44> the irresistible progress of the
legions of the North.The great army kept on its way by various routes, covering about fifteen
miles a day, and leaving a swath of destruction, from forty to sixty miles
wide, in its wake.Among the details attendant upon the march to the sea
was that of scientifically destroying the railroads that traversed the
region.Battalions of engineers had received special instruction in the
art, together with the necessary implements to facilitate rapid work.But
the infantry soon entered this service, too, and it was a common sight to
see a thousand soldiers in blue standing beside a stretch of railway, and,
when commanded, bend as one man and grasp the rail, and at a second
command to raise in unison, which brought a thousand railroad ties up on
end.Then the men fell upon them, ripping rail and tie apart, the rails to
be heated to a white heat and bent in fantastic shapes about some
convenient tree or other upright column, the ties being used as the fuel
with which to make the fires.All public buildings that might have a
military use were burned, together with a great number of private
dwellings and barns, some by accident, others wantonly.This fertile and
prosperous region, after the army had passed, was a scene of ruin and
desolation.As the army progressed, throngs of escaped slaves followed in its trail,
"from the baby in arms to the old <DW64> hobbling painfully along," says
General Howard, "<DW64>s of all sizes, in all sorts of patched costumes,
with carts and broken-down horses and mules to match."Many of the old
<DW64>s found it impossible to keep pace with the army for many days, and
having abandoned their homes and masters who could have cared for them,
they were left to die of hunger and exposure in that naked land.After the Ogeechee River was crossed, the character of the country was
greatly changed from that of central Georgia.No longer were there fertile
farms, laden with their Southern harvests of corn and vegetables, but
rather rice plantations and great pine forests, the solemn stillness of
which was broken by the tread of thousands of troops, the rumbling of
wagon-trains, and by the shouts and music of the marching men and of the
motley crowd of <DW64>s that followed.Day by day Sherman issued orders for the progress of the wings, but on
December 2d they contained the decisive words, "Savannah."What a tempting
prize was this fine Southern city, and how the Northern commander would
add to his laurels could he effect its capture!The memories clinging
about the historic old town, with its beautiful parks and its
magnolia-lined streets, are part of the inheritance of not only the South,
but of all America.Here Oglethorpe had bartered with the wild men of the
forest, and here, in the days of the Revolution, Count Pulaski and
Sergeant Jasper had given up their lives in the cause of liberty.Sherman had partially invested the city before the middle of December; but
it was well fortified and he refrained from assault.General Hardee, sent
by Hood from Tennessee, had command of the defenses, with about eighteen
thousand men.And there was Fort McAllister on the Ogeechee, protecting
the city on the south.But this obstruction to the Federals was soon
removed.General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth Corps was sent to
capture the fort.At five o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th Hazen's men
rushed through a shower of grape, over abatis and hidden torpedoes, scaled
the parapet and captured the garrison.That night Sherman boarded the
_Dandelion_, a Union vessel, in the river, and sent a message to the
outside world, the first since he had left Atlanta.Henceforth there was communication between the army and the Federal
squadron, under the command of Admiral Dahlgren.Among the vessels that
came up the river there was one that was received with great enthusiasm by
the soldiers.It brought mail, tons of it, for Sherman's army, the
accumulation of two months.One can imagine the eagerness with which
these war-stained veterans opened the longed-for letters and sought the
answer to the ever-recurring question, "How are things at home?"Sherman had set his heart on capturing Savannah; but, on December 15th, he
received a letter from Grant which greatly disturbed him.Grant ordered
him to leave his artillery and cavalry, with infantry enough to support
them, and with the remainder of his army to come by sea to Virginia and
join the forces before Richmond.Sherman prepared to obey, but hoped that
he would be able to capture the city before the transports would be ready
to carry him northward.He first called on Hardee to surrender the city, with a threat of
bombardment.Sherman hesitated to open with his guns
because of the bloodshed it would occasion, and on December 21st he was
greatly relieved to discover that Hardee had decided not to defend the
city, that he had escaped with his army the night before, by the one road
that was still open to him, which led across the Savannah River into the
Carolinas.The stream had been spanned by an improvised pontoon bridge,
consisting of river-boats, with planks from city wharves for flooring and
with old car-wheels for anchors.Sherman immediately took possession of
the city, and on December 22d he sent to President Lincoln this message:
"I beg to present to you, as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah, with
one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about
twenty-five thousand bales of cotton."As a matter of fact, over two
hundred and fifty guns were captured, and thirty-one thousand bales of
cotton.Events in the West now changed Grant's views as to Sherman's joining him
immediately in Virginia.On the 16th of December, General Thomas
accomplished the defeat and utter rout of Hood's army at Nashville.In
addition, it was found that, owing to lack of transports, it would take at
least two months to transfer Sherman's whole army by sea.Therefore, it
was decided that Sherman should march through the Carolinas, destroying
the railroads in both States as he went.A little more than a month
Sherman remained in Savannah.Then he began another great march, compared
with which, as Sherman himself declared, the march to the sea was as
child's play.The size of his army on leaving Savannah was practically the
same as when he left Atlanta--sixty thousand.It was divided into two
wings, under the same commanders, Howard and Slocum, and was to be
governed by the same rules.The
march from Savannah averaged ten miles a day, which, in view of the
conditions, was a very high average.The weather in the early part of the
journey was exceedingly wet and the roads were well-nigh impassable.Where
they were not actually under water the mud rendered them impassable until
corduroyed.Moreover, the troops had to wade streams, to drag themselves
through swamps and quagmires, and to remove great trees that had been
felled across their pathway.The city of Savannah was left under the control of General J. G. Foster,
and the Left Wing of Sherman's army under Slocum moved up the Savannah
River, accompanied by Kilpatrick, and crossed it at Sister's Ferry.The
river was overflowing its banks and the crossing, by means of a pontoon
bridge, was effected with the greatest difficulty.The Right Wing, under
Howard, embarked for Beaufort, South Carolina, and moved thence to
Pocotaligo, near the Broad River, whither Sherman had preceded it, and the
great march northward was fairly begun by February 1, 1865.Sherman had given out the word that he expected to go to Charleston or
Augusta, his purpose being to deceive the Confederates, since he had made
up his mind to march straight to Columbia, the capital of South Carolina.The two wings of the army were soon united and they continued their great
march from one end of the State of South Carolina to the other.The men
felt less restraint in devastating the country and despoiling the people
than they had felt in Georgia.The reason for this, given by Sherman and
others, was that there was a feeling of bitterness against South Carolina
as against no other State.It was this State that had led the procession
of seceding States and that had fired on Fort Sumter and brought on the
great war.No doubt this feeling, which pervaded the army, will account in
part for the reckless dealing with the inhabitants by the Federal
soldiery.The superior officers, however, made a sincere effort to
restrain lawlessness.On February 17th, Sherman entered Columbia, the mayor having come out and
surrendered the city.The Fifteenth Corps marched through the city and out
on the Camden road, the remainder of the army not having come within two
miles of the city.The conflagration
spread and ere the coming of the morning the best part of the city had
been laid in ashes.Before Sherman left Columbia he destroyed the machine-shops and everything
else which might aid the Confederacy.He left with the mayor one hundred
stand of arms with which to keep order, and five hundred head of cattle
for the destitute.As Columbia was approached by the Federals, the occupation of Charleston
by the Confederates became more and more untenable.In vain had the
governor of South Carolina pleaded with President Davis to reenforce
General Hardee, who occupied the city.Hardee thereupon evacuated the
historic old city--much of which was burned, whether by design or accident
is not known--and its defenses, including Fort Sumter, the bombardment of
which, nearly four years before, had precipitated the mighty conflict,
were occupied by Colonel Bennett, who came over from Morris Island.On March 11th, Sherman reached Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he
destroyed a fine arsenal.Hitherto, Sherman's march, except for the
annoyance of Wheeler's cavalry, had been but slightly impeded by the
Confederates.General Joseph B.
Johnston, his old foe of Resaca and Kenesaw Mountain, had been recalled
and was now in command of the troops in the Carolinas.No longer would the
streams and the swamps furnish the only resistance to the progress of the
Union army.The first engagement came at Averysboro on March 16th.General Hardee,
having taken a strong position, made a determined stand; but a division of
Slocum's wing, aided by Kilpatrick, soon put him to flight, with the loss
of several guns and over two hundred prisoners.The battle of Bentonville, which took place three days after that of
Averysboro, was more serious.Johnston had placed his whole army, probably
thirty-five thousand men, in the form of a V, the sides embracing the
village of Bentonville.Slocum engaged the Confederates while Howard was
hurried to the scene.On two days, the 19th and 20th of March, Sherman's
army fought its last battle in the Civil War.But Johnston, after making
several attacks, resulting in considerable losses on both sides, withdrew
his army during the night, and the Union army moved to Goldsboro.The
losses at Bentonville were: Federal, 1,527; Confederate, 2,606.At Goldsboro the Union army was reenforced by its junction with Schofield,
who had come out of the West with over twenty-two thousand men from the
army of Thomas in Tennessee.Sherman's third great march was practically over.As to the relative
importance of the second and third, Sherman declares in his memoirs, he
would place that from Atlanta to the sea at one, and that from Savannah
through the Carolinas at ten.Leaving his army in charge of Schofield, Sherman went to City Point, in
Virginia, where he had a conference with General Grant and President
Lincoln, and plans for the final campaign were definitely arranged.He
returned to Goldsboro late in March, and, pursuing Johnston, received,
finally, on April 26th the surrender of his army.[Illustration: BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]These two photographs of General Sherman were taken in 1864--the year that
made him an international figure, before his march to the sea which
electrified the civilized world, and exposed once for all the crippled
condition of the Confederacy.After that autumn expedition, the problem of
the Union generals was merely to contend with detached armies, no longer
with the combined States of the Confederacy.The latter had no means of
extending further support to the dwindling troops in the field.Sherman
was the chief Union exponent of the tactical gift that makes marches count
as much as fighting.In the early part of 1864 he made his famous raid
across Mississippi from Jackson to Meridian and back again, destroying the
railroads, Confederate stores, and other property, and desolating the
country along the line of march.In May he set out from Chattanooga for
the invasion of Georgia.For his success in this campaign he was
appointed, on August 12th, a major-general in the regular army.On
November 12th, he started with the pick of his men on his march to the
sea.After the capture of Savannah, December 21st, Sherman's fame was
secure; yet he was one of the most heartily execrated leaders of the war.There is a hint of a smile in the right-hand picture.The left-hand
portrait reveals all the sternness and determination of a leader
surrounded by dangers, about to penetrate an enemy's country against the
advice of accepted military authorities.[Illustration: THE ATLANTA BANK BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]As this photograph was taken, the wagons stood in the street of Atlanta
ready to accompany the Federals in their impending march to the sea.The
most interesting thing is the bank building on the corner, completely
destroyed, although around it stand the stores of merchants entirely
untouched.Evidently there had been here faithful execution of Sherman's
orders to his engineers--to destroy all buildings and property of a public
nature, such as factories, foundries, railroad stations, and the like; but
to protect as far as possible strictly private dwellings and enterprises.Those of a later generation who witnessed the growth of Atlanta within
less than half a century after this photograph was taken, and saw tall
office-buildings and streets humming with industry around the location in
this photograph, will find in it an added fascination.[Illustration: "TUNING UP"--A DAILY DRILL IN THE CAPTURED FORT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here Sherman's men are seen at daily drill in Atlanta.This photograph has
an interest beyond most war pictures, for it gives a clear idea of the
soldierly bearing of the men that were to march to the sea.There was an
easy carelessness in their appearance copied from their great commander,
but they were never allowed to become slouchy.Sherman was the antithesis
of a martinet, but he had, in the Atlanta campaign, molded his army into
the "mobile machine" that he desired it to be, and he was anxious to keep
the men up to this high pitch of efficiency for the performance of still
greater deeds.No better disciplined army existed in the world at the time
Sherman's "<DW15>s" set out for the sea.[Illustration: CUTTING LOOSE FROM THE BASE, NOVEMBER 12th

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB."On the 12th of November the railroad and telegraph communications with
the rear were broken and the army stood detached from all friends,
dependent on its own resources and supplies," writes Sherman.Meanwhile
all detachments were marching rapidly to Atlanta with orders to break up
the railroad en route and "generally to so damage the country as to make
it untenable to the enemy."Sherman, in
a home letter written from Grand Gulf, Mississippi, May 6, 1863, stated
clearly his views regarding the destruction of property.Speaking of the
wanton havoc wrought on a fine plantation in the path of the army, he
added: "It is done, of course, by the accursed stragglers who won't fight
but hang behind and disgrace our cause and country.Bowie had fled,
leaving everything on the approach of our troops.Of course, devastation
marked the whole path of the army, and I know all the principal officers
detest the infamous practice as much as I do.Of course, I expect and do
take corn, bacon, ham, mules, and everything to support an army, and don't
object much to the using of fences for firewood, but this universal
burning and wanton destruction of private property is not justified in
war."[Illustration: THE BUSTLE OF DEPARTURE FROM ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Sherman's men worked like beavers during their last few days in Atlanta.There was no time to be lost; the army was gotten under way with that
precision which marked all Sherman's movements.In the upper picture,
finishing touches are being put to the railroad, and in the lower is seen
the short work that was made of such public buildings as might be of the
slightest use in case the Confederates should recapture the town.As far
back as Chattanooga, while plans for the Atlanta campaign were being
formed, Sherman had been revolving a subsequent march to the sea in case
he was successful.He had not then made up his mind whether it should be
in the direction of Mobile or Savannah, but his Meridian campaign, in
Mississippi, had convinced him that the march was entirely feasible, and
gradually he worked out in his mind its masterly details.At seven in the
morning on November 16th, Sherman rode out along the Decatur road, passed
his marching troops, and near the spot where his beloved McPherson had
fallen, paused for a last look at the city."Behind us," he says, "lay
Atlanta, smouldering and in ruins, the black smoke rising high in air and
hanging like a pall over the ruined city."All about could be seen the
glistening gun-barrels and white-topped wagons, "and the men marching
steadily and rapidly with a cheery look and swinging pace."Some
regimental band struck up "John Brown," and the thousands of voices of the
vast army joined with a mighty chorus in song.A feeling of exhilaration
pervaded the troops.This marching into the unknown held for them the
allurement of adventure, as none but Sherman knew their destination.But
as he worked his way past them on the road, many a group called out,
"Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at Richmond."The
devil-may-care spirit of the troops brought to Sherman's mind grave
thoughts of his own responsibility.He knew that success would be regarded
as a matter of course, but should he fail the march would be set down as
"the wild adventure of a crazy fool."He had no intention of marching
directly to Richmond, but from the first his objective was the seacoast,
at Savannah or Port Royal, or even Pensacola, Florida.[Illustration: RUINS IN ATLANTA]


[Illustration: THE GUNS THAT SHERMAN TOOK ALONG

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In Hood's hasty evacuation of Atlanta many of his guns were left behind.These 12-pounder Napoleon bronze field-pieces have been gathered by the
Federals from the abandoned fortifications, which had been equipped
entirely with field artillery, such as these.It was an extremely useful
capture for Sherman's army, whose supply of artillery had been somewhat
limited during the siege, and still further reduced by the necessity to
fortify Atlanta.On the march to the sea Sherman took with him only
sixty-five field-pieces.The <DW64> refugees in the lower picture recall an
embarrassment of the march to the sea."<DW64>s of all sizes" flocked in
the army's path and stayed there, a picturesque procession, holding
tightly to the skirts of the army which they believed had come for the
sole purpose of setting them free.The cavalcade of <DW64>s soon became so
numerous that Sherman became anxious for his army's sustenance, and
finding an old gray-haired black at Covington, Sherman explained to him
carefully that if the <DW64>s continued to swarm after the army it would
fail in its purpose and they would not get their freedom.Sherman believed
that the old man spread this news to the slaves along the line of march,
and in part saved the army from being overwhelmed by the contrabands.[Illustration: <DW64>s FLOCKING IN THE ARMY'S PATH

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE DEFENDER OF SAVANNAH]

The task of General Hardee in defending Savannah was one of peculiar
difficulty.He had only eighteen thousand men, and he was uncertain where
Sherman would strike.Some supposed that Sherman would move at once upon
Charleston, but Hardee argued that the Union army would have to establish
a new base of supplies on the seacoast before attempting to cross the
numerous deep rivers and swamps of South Carolina.Hardee's task therefore
was to hold Savannah just as long as possible, and then to withdraw
northward to unite with the troops which General Bragg was assembling, and
with the detachments scattered at this time over the Carolinas.In
protecting his position around Savannah, Fort McAllister was of prime
importance, since it commanded the Great Ogeechee River in such a way as
to prevent the approach of the Federal fleet, Sherman's dependence for
supplies.It was accordingly manned by a force of two hundred under
command of Major G. W. Anderson, provided with fifty days' rations for use
in case the work became isolated.About
noon of December 13th, Major Anderson's men saw troops in blue moving
about in the woods.The artillery on the land side
of the fort was turned upon them as they advanced from one position to
another, and sharpshooters picked off some of their officers.At half-past
four o'clock, however, the long-expected charge was made from three
different directions, so that the defenders, too few in number to hold the
whole line, were soon overpowered.Hardee now had to consider more
narrowly the best time for withdrawing from the lines at Savannah.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER--THE LAST BARRIER TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911 PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: WATERFRONT AT SAVANNAH, 1865

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Savannah was better protected by nature from attack by land or water than
any other city near the Atlantic seaboard.Stretching to the north, east,
and southward lay swamps and morasses through which ran the river-approach
of twelve miles to the town.Innumerable small creeks separated the
marshes into islands over which it was out of the question for an army to
march without first building roads and bridging miles of waterways.The
Federal fleet had for months been on the blockade off the mouth of the
river, and Savannah had been closed to blockade runners since the fall of
Fort Pulaski in April, 1862.But obstructions and powerful batteries held
the river, and Fort McAllister, ten miles to the south, on the Ogeechee,
still held the city safe in its guardianship.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER, THAT HELD THE FLEET AT BAY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE FIFTEEN MINUTES' FIGHT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Across these ditches at Fort McAllister, through entangling abatis, over
palisading, the Federals had to fight every inch of their way against the
Confederate garrison up to the very doors of their bomb-proofs, before the
defenders yielded on December 13th.Sherman had at once perceived that the
position could be carried only by a land assault.The fort was strongly
protected by ditches, palisades, and plentiful abatis; marshes and streams
covered its flanks, but Sherman's troops knew that shoes and clothing and
abundant rations were waiting for them just beyond it, and had any of them
been asked if they could take the fort their reply would have been in the
words of the poem: "Ain't we simply got to take it?"Sherman selected for
the honor of the assault General Hazen's second division of the Fifteenth
Corps, the same which he himself had commanded at Shiloh and Vicksburg.Gaily the troops crossed the bridge on the morning of the 13th.Sherman
was watching anxiously through his glass late in the afternoon when a
Federal steamer came up the river and signaled the query: "Is Fort
McAllister taken?"To which Sherman sent reply: "Not yet, but it will be
in a minute."At that instant Sherman saw Hazen's troops emerge from the
woods before the fort, "the lines dressed as on parade, with colors
flying."Immediately dense clouds of smoke belching from the fort
enveloped the Federals.There was a pause; the smoke cleared away, and,
says Sherman, "the parapets were blue with our men."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: A BIG GUN AT FORT McALLISTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Fort McAllister is at last in complete possession of the Federals, and a
group of the men who had charged over these ramparts has arranged itself
before the camera as if in the very act of firing the great gun that
points seaward across the marshes, toward Ossabaw Sound.There is one very
peculiar thing proved by this photograph--the gun itself is almost in a
fixed position as regards range and sweep of fire.Instead of the
elevating screw to raise or depress the muzzle, there has been substituted
a block of wood wedged with a heavy spike, and the narrow pit in which the
gun carriage is sunk admits of it being turned but a foot or so to right
or left.It evidently controlled one critical point in the river, but
could not have been used in lending any aid to the repelling of General
Hazen's attack.The officer pointing with outstretched arm is indicating
the very spot at which a shell fired from his gun would fall.The men in
the trench are artillerymen of General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth
Corps; their appearance in their fine uniforms, polished breastplates and
buttons, proves that Sherman's men could not have presented the ragged
appearance that they are often pictured as doing in the war-time sketches.That Army and Navy have come together is proved also by the figure of a
marine from the fleet, who is standing at "Attention" just above the
breach of the gun.Next, leaning on his saber, is a cavalryman, in short
jacket and chin-strap.[Illustration: THE SPOILS OF VICTORY]

THE TROOPS THAT MARCHED TO THE SEA BECOME DAY-LABORERS

Here are the men that marched to the sea doing their turn as day-laborers,
gleefully trundling their wheelbarrows, gathering up everything of value
in Fort McAllister to swell the size of Sherman's "Christmas present."Brigadier-General W. B. Hazen, after his men had successfully stormed the
stubbornly defended fort, reported the capture of twenty-four pieces of
ordnance, with their equipment, forty tons of ammunition, a month's supply
of food for the garrison, and the small arms of the command.In the upper
picture the army engineers are busily at work removing a great 48-pounder
8-inch Columbiad that had so long repelled the Federal fleet.There is
always work enough and to spare for the engineers both before and after
the capture of a fortified position.In the wheelbarrows is a harvest of
shells and torpedoes.These deadly instruments of destruction had been
relied upon by the Confederates to protect the land approach to Fort
McAllister, which was much less strongly defensible on that side than at
the waterfront.While Sherman's army was approaching Savannah one of his
officers had his leg blown off by a torpedo buried in the road and stepped
on by his horse.After that Sherman set a line of Confederate prisoners
across the road to march ahead of the army, and no more torpedoes were
found.After the capture of Fort McAllister the troops set to work
gingerly scraping about wherever the ground seemed to have been disturbed,
trying to find and remove the dangerous hidden menaces to life.At last
the ground was rendered safe and the troops settled down to the occupation
of Fort McAllister where the bravely fighting little Confederate garrison
had held the key to Savannah.The city was the first to fall of the
Confederacy's Atlantic seaports, now almost locked from the outside world
by the blockade.By the capture of Fort McAllister, which crowned the
march to the sea, Sherman had numbered the days of the war.The fall of
the remaining ports was to follow in quick succession, and by Washington's
Birthday, 1865, the entire coast-line was to be in possession of the
Federals.[Illustration: SHERMAN'S TROOPS DISMANTLING FORT McALLISTER]

chapter of the war, April 26, 1865.In Bennett's little farmhouse, near
Durham's Station, N. C., were begun the negotiations between Johnston and
Sherman which finally led to that event.The two generals met there on
April 17th; it was a highly dramatic moment, for Sherman had in his pocket
the cipher message just received telling of the assassination of Lincoln.[Illustration: THE END OF THE MARCH--BENNETT'S FARMHOUSE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This craft, the "Commodore Perry," was an old New York ferryboat purchased
and hastily pressed into service by the Federal navy to help solve the
problem of patrolling the three thousand miles of coast, along which the
blockade must be made effective.In order to penetrate the intricate
inlets and rivers, light-draft fighting-vessels were required, and the
most immediate means of securing these was to purchase every sort of
merchant craft that could possibly be adapted to the purposes of war,
either as a fighting-vessel or as a transport.The ferryboat in the
picture has been provided with guns and her pilot-houses armored.A
casemate of iron plates has been provided for the gunners.The Navy
Department purchased and equipped in all one hundred and thirty-six
vessels in 1861, and by the end of the year had increased the number of
seamen in the service from 7,600 to over 22,000.Many of these new
recruits saw their first active service aboard the converted ferryboats,
tugboats, and other frail and unfamiliar vessels making up the nondescript
fleet that undertook to cut off the commerce of the South.The experience
thus gained under very unusual circumstances placed them of necessity
among the bravest sailors of the navy.[Illustration: THE LAST PORT CLOSED

Wilmington, the great importing depot of the South, on which General Lee
said the subsistence of his army depended, was finally closed to all

of this port the most powerful naval force ever assembled up to that
time--fifty-five ships of war, including five ironclads, altogether
carrying six hundred guns.The upper picture shows the nature of the
palisade, nine feet high, over which some two thousand marines attempted
to pass; the lower shows interior of the works after the destructive

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]It frequently took a blockade-runner to
catch a blockade-runner, and as the Federal navy captured ship after ship
of this character they began to acquire a numerous fleet of swift steamers
from which it was difficult for any vessel to get away.The "Vance"
brought many a cargo to the hungry Southern ports, slipping safely by the
blockading fleet and back again till her shrewd Captain Willie felt that
he could give the slip to anything afloat.On her last trip she had safely
gotten by the Federal vessels lying off the harbor of Wilmington, North
Carolina, and was dancing gleefully on her way with a bountiful cargo of
cotton and turpentine when, on September 10, 1864, in latitude 34 deg.W., a vessel was sighted which rapidly bore down upon
her.It proved to be the "Santiago de Cuba," Captain O. S. Glisson.The
rapidity with which the approaching vessel overhauled him was enough to
convince Captain Willie that she was in his own class.The "Santiago de
Cuba" carried eleven guns, and the "Vance" humbly hove to, to receive the
prize-crew which took her to Boston, where she was condemned.In the
picture we see her lying high out of the water, her valuable cargo having
been removed and sold to enrich by prize-money the officers and men of her
fleet captor.[Illustration: A GREYHOUND CAUGHT--WRECK OF THE BLOCKADE-RUNNER "COLT"]

The wreck of this blockade-runner, the "Colt," lies off Sullivan's Island,
Charleston Harbor, in 1865.The coast of the Carolinas, before the war was
over, was strewn with just such sights as this.The bones of former
"greyhounds" became landmarks by which the still uncaptured
blockade-runners could get their bearings and lay a course to safety.If
one of these vessels were cut off from making port and surrounded by
Federal pursuers, the next best thing was to run her ashore in shallow
water, where the gunboats could not follow and where her valuable cargo
could be secured by the Confederates.A single cargo at war-time prices
was enough to pay more than the cost of the vessel.Regular auctions were
held in Charleston or Wilmington, where prices for goods not needed by the
Confederate Government were run up to fabulous figures.The business of
blockade-running was well organized abroad, especially in England.One
successful trip was enough to start the enterprise with a handsome profit.A blockade-runner like the "Kate," which made forty trips or more, would
enrich her owners almost beyond the dreams of avarice.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE RAM "STONEWALL"]

Here are two striking views in the Port Royal dry-dock of the Confederate
ram "Stonewall."When this powerful fighting-ship sailed from Copenhagen,
Jan.T. J. Page, C. S. N., the Federal
navy became confronted by its most formidable antagonist during the war.In March, 1863, the Confederacy had negotiated a loan of L3,000,000, and
being thus at last in possession of the necessary funds, Captain Bulloch
and Mr.Slidell arranged with M. Arman, who was a member of the
_Corps-Legislatif_ and proprietor of a large shipyard at Bordeaux, for the
construction of ironclad ships of war.Slidell had already received
assurances from persons in the confidence of Napoleon III that the
building of the ships in the French yards would not be interfered with,
and that getting them to sea would be connived at by the Government.Owing
to the indubitable proof laid before the Emperor by the Federal diplomats
at Paris, he was compelled to revoke the guarantee that had been given to
Slidell and Bulloch.A plan was arranged, however, by which M. Arman
should sell the vessels to various European powers; and he disposed of the
ironclad ram "Sphinx" to the Danish Government, then at war with Prussia.Delivery of the ship at Copenhagen was not made, however, till after the
war had ceased, and no trouble was experienced by the Confederates in
arranging for the purchase of the vessel.On January 24, 1865, she
rendezvoused off Quiberon, on the French coast; the remainder of her
officers, crew, and supplies were put aboard of her; the Confederate flag
was hoisted over her, and she was christened the "Stonewall."Already the
vessel was discovered to have sprung a leak, and Captain Page ran into
Ferrol, Spain.Here dock-yard facilities were at first granted, but were
withdrawn at the protest of the American Minister.While Captain Page was
repairing his vessel as best he could, the "Niagara" and the "Sacramento"
appeared, and after some weeks the "Stonewall" offered battle in vain.[Illustration]

THE LAST INVASION OF TENNESSEE--FRANKLIN--NASHVILLE


In the latter days of September, 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee
lay in the vicinity of Macon, Georgia.It was a dispirited body of men,
homesick and discouraged.For four long months, first under one leader and
then under another, it had opposed, step by step, Sherman's advance toward
Atlanta, and now that important strategic point was in the hands of the
Federal forces.About the middle of July the President of the Confederacy
had seen fit to remove Joseph E. Johnston from the command and replace him
with John B. Hood.The latter's habit of mind and methods of action led
the Richmond authorities to believe that he would proceed very differently
from Johnston, and in this he did not disappoint them.The results showed
that Johnston's Fabian policy was by far the better one under the
circumstances.Sherman had the stronger army, but he was compelled
constantly to detach portions of it in order to guard his lengthening line
of supplies.The one thing he desired most was that his opponent should
assume an aggressive attitude.Hood's idea was precipitation rather than
patience, and in consequence on the 2d of September General Slocum entered
the coveted city.On the 22d of that month President Davis visited the Southern Army, and
made a memorable address to the troops.He promised them--and they were
delighted at the news--that they would soon be back in Tennessee, for a
fresh invasion of that State had been planned.This would, declared the
speaker, place Sherman in a worse predicament than that in which Napoleon
found himself at Moscow.But the Federal general had at least the
advantage of learning what was going to happen to him, for the President's
words were reported verbatim in the Southern papers, and he prepared to
meet his antagonists.Thomas, with the Army of the Cumberland, was sent to
Nashville while Schofield, with his smaller force known as the Army of the
Ohio, returned to Knoxville where he had spent the previous winter, to
await Hood's advance.By the 1st of October the latter was across the
Chattahoochee in the hope of drawing Sherman from Atlanta.There was a
brave fight at Allatoona where General Corse "held the fort," but Sherman,
although he followed the Confederate army, was unable to bring on a
general engagement.His great plan of a march through Georgia to the sea was now fully formed
in his mind.He had not yet obtained Grant's sanction to the scheme, but
he ordered Schofield to cooperate with Thomas and sent the Fourth Corps as
further assistance.He himself ceased the pursuit of Hood at Gaylesville
and turned back to Atlanta, confident that the fate of Tennessee was safe
in the hands of his ablest lieutenant, George H. Thomas.Hood appeared on
the 26th of October at Decatur on the south bank of the Tennessee River.Lack of supplies had delayed his advance, but even so his performances had
greatly alarmed the North.Twice had he interposed between Sherman and the
Federal base and had destroyed many miles of railway, but what in other
circumstances would have placed the Union leader in a dangerous
predicament was now of little moment, since the latter was rapidly making
preparations to cut himself off from all communication with the source of
his supplies.It was necessary that Hood should have the assistance of
Forrest, whose dauntless cavalry had been playing great havoc with the
Federal stores in western Tennessee, so he moved to Florence before
crossing the river, and here Forrest joined him on November 14th.In the
meantime, Schofield, with about twenty-eight thousand men, had reached
Pulaski on the way to encounter the Southern advance.Now began a series of brilliant strategic moves, kept up for a fortnight
before the two small armies--they were of almost equal strength met in
one awful clash.Hood's efforts were bent toward cutting Schofield off
from Thomas at Nashville.There was a mad race for the Duck River, and the
Federals got over at Columbia in the very nick of time.The Southern
leader, by a skilful piece of strategy and a forced march, pushed on to
Spring Hill ahead of his opponent.He was in an excellent position to
annihilate General Stanley who was in advance, and then crush the
remainder of the Federals who were moving with the slow wagon-trains.But
owing to a number of strange mishaps, which brought forth much
recrimination but no satisfactory explanation, the Union army slipped by
with little damage and entrenched itself at Franklin on the Harpeth River.Of all the dark days of Confederate history--and they were many--the 29th
of November, 1864, has been mourned as that of "lost opportunities."Schofield did not expect, or desire, a battle at Franklin, but he was
treated to one the following afternoon when the Confederates came up, and
it was of the most severe nature.The first attack was made as the light
began to wane, and the Federal troops stood their ground although the
orders had been to withdraw, because through some blunder two brigades in
blue had been stationed, unsupported, directly in front of Hood's
approach.The stubborn resistance of Schofield's army only increased the
ardor of the opponents.It is said that thirteen separate assaults were
made upon the Union entrenchments, and the fearful carnage was finally
carried into the streets and among the dooryards of the little town.At
nine o'clock the fury of the iron storm was quelled.Five Confederate
generals, including the gallant Cleburne, lay dead upon the field.In two
of the Southern brigades all the general officers were either killed or
wounded.Hood's loss was about sixty-three hundred, nearly three times
that of Schofield.By midnight the latter was on his way, uninterrupted,
to Nashville.Meanwhile Thomas was performing a herculean task within the
fortifications of that capital city.He had received a large number of
raw recruits and a motley collection of troops from garrisons in the West.These had to be drilled into an efficient army, and not one move to fight
would Thomas make until this had been done.Grant, in Virginia, grew
impatient and the Northern papers clamored for an attack on Hood, who had
now arrived with thirty-eight thousand men before the city.Finally Grant
took action, and General Logan was hurrying to assume the Federal command.But by the time he reached Louisville there was no need for his services.Thomas had for some days been ready with his force of forty-five thousand,
but to increase the difficulties of his position, a severe storm of
freezing rain made action impossible until the morning of December 15th.The Union lines of defense were in a semi-circle and Hood was on the
southeast, lightly entrenched.The first assault on his right wing
followed by one on his left, forced the Confederates back to a second
position two miles to the south, and that was the first day's work.Hood
had detached a part of his forces and he did all he could to gain time
until he might recover his full strength.But he had respite only until
Thomas was ready on the morrow, which was about noon.The Union army
deployed in front of the Southerners and overlapped their left wing.An
attack on the front was bravely met and repulsed by the Confederates, and
the Federal leader, extending his right, compelled his opponent to stretch
his own lines more and more.Finally they broke just to the left of the
center, and a general forward movement on the Union side ended in the
utter rout of the splendid and courageous Army of Tennessee.It melted away in disorder; the pursuit was vigorous, and only a small
portion reassembled at Columbia and fell back with a poor show of order
behind the Tennessee.Many military historians have seen in the battle of Nashville the most
crushing defeat of the war.Certainly no other brought such complete ruin
upon a large and well-organized body of troops.[Illustration: RUSHING A FEDERAL BATTERY OUT OF JOHNSONVILLE

he ordered the garrison at Johnsonville, on the Tennessee, eighty miles
due west of Nashville, to leave that place and hasten north.It was the
garrison at this same Johnsonville that, a month earlier, had been
frightened into panic and flight when the bold Confederate raider,
Forrest, appeared on the west bank of the river and began a noisy
cannonade.The day after the photograph was taken (November 23d) the
encampment in the picture was broken.[Illustration: FORT NEGLEY, LOOKING TOWARD THE CONFEDERATE CENTER AND

THE SIEGE AND FALL OF PETERSBURG

    It is not improbable that Grant might have made more headway by
    leaving a sufficient part of his army in the trenches in front of
    Petersburg and by moving with a heavy force far to the west upon Lee's
    communications; or, if it were determined to capture the place _a main
    forte_, by making a massed attack upon some point in the center after
    suitable mining operations had weakened Lee's defenses and prepared
    for such an operation.But the end was to come with opening spring.To
    the far-sighted, this was no longer doubtful.The South must succumb
    to the greater material resources of the North, despite its courage
    and its sacrifices.--_Colonel T. A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye
    View of Our Civil War."_


During the winter of 1864-65, General Lee, fighting Grant without, was
fighting famine within.The shivering, half-clad soldiers of the South
crouched over feeble fires in their entrenchments.The men were exposed to
the rain, snow, and sleet; sickness and disease soon added their horrors
to the desolation.The
life of the Confederacy was ebbing fast.Behind Union breastworks, early in 1865, General Grant was making
preparations for the opening of a determined campaign with the coming of
spring.Mile after mile had been added to his entrenchments, and they now
extended to Hatcher's Run on the left.The Confederate lines had been
stretched until they were so thin that there was constant danger of
breaking.A. P. Hill was posted on the right; Gordon and Anderson held the
center, and Longstreet was on the left.Union troops were mobilizing in
front of Petersburg.By February 1st, Sherman was fairly off from Savannah
on his northward march to join Grant.He was weak in cavalry and Grant
determined to bring Sheridan from the Shenandoah, whence the bulk of
Early's forces had been withdrawn, and send him to assist Sherman.Sheridan left Winchester February 27th, wreaking much destruction as he
advanced, but circumstances compelled him to seek a new base at White
House.On March 27th he formed a junction with the armies of the Potomac
and the James.Such were the happenings that prompted Lee to prepare for
the evacuation of Petersburg.And he might be able, in his rapid marches,
to outdistance Grant, join his forces with those of Johnston, fall on
Sherman, destroy one wing of the Union army and arouse the hopes of his
soldiers, and prolong the life of his Government.General Grant knew the condition of Lee's army and, with the unerring
instinct of a military leader, surmised what the plan of the Southern
general must be.He decided to move on the left, destroy both the Danville
and South Side railroads, and put his army in better condition to pursue.General Lee, in order to get Grant to look another way for a while,
decided to attack Grant's line on the right, and gain some of the works.This would compel Grant to draw some of his force from his left and secure
a way of escape to the west.This bold plan was left for execution to the
gallant Georgian, General John B. Gordon, who had successfully led the
reverse attack at Cedar Creek, in the Shenandoah, in October, 1864.Near
the crater stood Fort Stedman.Between it and the Confederate front, a
distance of about one hundred and fifty yards, was a strip of firm earth,
in full view of both picket lines.Across this space some deserters had
passed to the Union entrenchments.General Gordon took advantage of this
fact and accordingly selected his men, who, at the sound of the signal
gun, should disarm the Federal pickets, while fifty more men were to cross
the open space quickly with axes and cut away the abatis, and three
hundred others were to rush through the opening, and capture the fort and
guns.At four o'clock on the morning of March 25, 1865, Gordon had everything in
readiness.His chosen band wore white strips of cloth across the breast,
that they might distinguish each other in the hand-to-hand fight that
would doubtless ensue.Behind these men half of Lee's army was massed to
support the attack.In the silence of the early morning, a gunshot rang
out from the Confederate works.Not a Federal picket-shot was heard.The
axemen rushed across the open and soon the thuds of their axes told of the
cutting away of the abatis.The three hundred surged through the entrance,
overpowered the gunners, captured batteries to the right and to the left,
and were in control of the situation.Gordon's corps of about five
thousand was on hand to sustain the attack but the remaining reserves,
through failure of the guides, did not come, and the general found himself
cut off with a rapidly increasing army surrounding him.Fort Haskell, on the left, began to throw its shells.Under its cover,
heavy columns of Federals sent by General Parke, now commanding the Ninth
Corps, pressed forward.The Confederates resisted the charge, and from the
captured Fort Stedman and the adjoining batteries poured volley after
volley on Willcox's advancing lines of blue.The Northerners fell back,
only to re-form and renew the attack.This time they secured a footing,
and for twenty minutes the fighting was terrific.Then across the brow of the hill swept the command of Hartranft.The furious musketry, and
artillery directed by General Tidball, shrivelled up the ranks of Gordon
until they fled from the fort and its neighboring batteries in the midst
of withering fire, and those who did not were captured.This was the last
aggressive effort of the expiring Confederacy in front of Petersburg, and
it cost three thousand men.The affair at Fort Stedman did not turn Grant from his plans against the
Confederate right.With the railroads here destroyed, Richmond would be
completely cut off.On the morning of the 29th, as previously arranged,
the movement began.Sheridan swept to the south with his cavalry, as if he
were to fall upon the railroads.General Warren, with fifteen thousand
men, was working his way through the tangled woods and low swamps in the
direction of Lee's right.At the same time, Lee stripped his entrenchments
at Petersburg as much as he dared and hurried General Anderson, with
infantry, and Fitzhugh Lee, with cavalry, forward to hold the roads over
which he hoped to escape.On Friday morning, March 31st, the opposing
forces, the Confederates much reenforced, found themselves at Dinwiddie
Court House.The woods and swamps prevented the formation of a regular
line of battle.Lee made his accustomed flank movement, with heavy loss to
the Federals as they tried to move in the swampy forests.The Northerners
finally were ready to advance when it was found that Lee had fallen back.During the day and night, reenforcements were coming in from all sides.The Confederates had taken their position at Five Forks.Early the next afternoon, the 1st of April, Sheridan, reenforced by
Warren, was arranging his troops for battle.The day was nearly spent when
all was in readiness.The sun was not more than two hours high when the
Northern army moved toward that of the South, defended by a breastwork
behind a dense undergrowth of pines.Through this mass of timber the
Federals crept with bayonets fixed.They charged upon the Confederates,
but, at the same time, a galling fire poured into them from the left,
spreading dismay and destruction in their midst.The intrepid Sheridan
urged his black battle-charger, the famous Rienzi, now known as
Winchester, up and down the lines, cheering his men on in the fight.He
seemed to be everywhere at once.The Confederate left was streaming down
the White Oak Road.But General Crawford had reached a cross-road, by
taking a circuitous route, and the Southern army was thus shut off from
retreat.The Federal cavalry had dismounted and was doing its full share
of work.The Confederates soon found themselves trapped, and the part of
their army in action that day was nearly annihilated.With night came the news of the crushing blow to Lee.General Grant was
seated by his camp-fire surrounded by his staff, when a courier dashed
into his presence with the message of victory.Soon from every great gun
along the Union line belched forth the sheets of flame.The earth shook
with the awful cannonade.Mortar shells made huge parabolas through the
air.The Union batteries crept closer and closer to the Confederate lines
and the balls crashed into the streets of the doomed city.At dawn of the 2nd of April the grand assault began.The Federal troops
sprang forward with a rush.Despite the storms of grape and canister, the
Sixth Corps plunged through the battery smoke, and across the walls,
pushing the brave defenders to the inner works.The whole corps penetrated
the lines and swept everything before it toward Hatcher's Run.Some of the
troops even reached the South Side Railroad, where the brave General A. P.
Hill fell mortally wounded.Everywhere, the blue masses poured into the works.General Ord, on the
right of the Sixth Corps, helped to shut the Confederate right into the
city.General Parke, with the Ninth Corps, carried the main line.The thin
gray line could no longer stem the tide that was engulfing it.The
Confederate troops south of Hatcher's Run fled to the west, and fought
General Miles until General Sheridan and a division from Meade appeared on
the scene.By noon the Federals held the line of the outer works from Fort
Gregg to the Appomattox.The last stronghold carried was Fort Gregg, at
which the men of Gibbon's corps had one of the most desperate struggles of
the war.The Confederates now fell back to the inner fortifications and
the siege of Petersburg came to an end.[Illustration: A BATTERED RELIC OF COLONIAL DAYS IN PETERSBURG

the visitation of the falling shells fit habitations for mankind.Many of
these handsome residences were utterly destroyed, their fixtures shattered
beyond repair; their wainscoting, built when the Commonwealth of Virginia
was ruled over by the representative of King George, was torn from the
walls and, bursting into flames, made a funeral pyre of past comforts and
magnificence.The havoc wrought upon the dwellings of the town was heavy;
certain localities suffered more than others, and those residents who
seemed to dwell in the safest zones had been ever ready to open their
houses to the sick and wounded of Lee's army.As Grant's troops marched
in, many pale faces gazed out at them from the windows, and at the
doorsteps stood men whose wounds exempted them from ever bearing arms
again.[Illustration: THE SHATTERED DOORWAY

the two lines, separated by only fifty yards, sallies and counter-sallies
were continual occurrences after dark.In stealthy sorties one side or the

attempt to storm the works by rushing tactics on the part of the Federal
infantry.Not far from here lies the excavation of the Crater.[Illustration: GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON, C. S.To this gallant young Georgia officer, just turned thirty-three at the
time, Lee entrusted the last desperate effort to break through the
tightening Federal lines, March 25, 1865.Lee was confronted by the
dilemma of either being starved out of Petersburg and Richmond, or of
getting out himself and uniting his army to that of Johnston in North
Carolina to crush Sherman before Grant could reach him.Gordon was to
begin this latter, almost impossible, task by an attack on Fort Stedman,
which the Confederates believed to be the weakest point in the Federal
fortifications.The position had been captured from them in the beginning,
and they knew that the nature of the ground and its nearness to their own
lines had made it difficult to strengthen it very much.It was planned to
surprise the fort before daylight.Below are seen the rabbit-like burrows
of Gracie's Salient, past which Gordon led his famished men.When the
order came to go forward, they did not flinch, but hurled themselves
bravely against fortifications far stronger than their own.Three columns
of a hundred picked men each moved down the <DW72> shown on the left and
advanced in the darkness against Stedman.They were to be followed by a
division.Through the gap which the storming parties were expected to open
in the Federal lines, Gordon's columns would rush in both directions and a
cavalry force was to sweep on and destroy the pontoon bridges across the
Appomattox and to raid City Point, breaking up the Federal base.It was no
light task, for although Fort Stedman itself was weak, it was flanked by
Battery No.An
attacking party on the right would be exposed to an enfilading fire in
crossing the plain; while on the left the approach was difficult be cause
of ravines, one of which the Confederate engineers had turned into a pond
by damming a creek.All night long General Gordon's wife, with the brave
women of Petersburg, sat up tearing strips of white cloth, to be tied on
the arms of the men in the storming parties so that they could tell friend
from foe in the darkness and confusion of the assault.Before the
sleep-dazed Federals could offer effective resistance, Gordon's men had
possession of the fort and the batteries.Only after one of the severest
engagements of the siege were the Confederates driven back.[Illustration: GRACIE'S SALIENT--AFTER GORDON'S FORLORN HOPE HAD CHARGED]


APRIL SECOND--"THIS IS A SAD BUSINESS"

As his general watched, this boy fought to stem the Federal rush--but
fell, his breast pierced by a bayonet, in the trenches of Fort Mahone.It
is heart-rending to look at a picture such as this; it is sad to think of
it and to write about it.Here is a boy of only fourteen years, his face
innocent of a razor, his feet unshod and stockingless in the bitter April
weather.It is to be hoped that the man who slew him has forgotten it, for
this face would haunt him surely.Many who fought in the blue ranks were
young, but in the South there were whole companies made up of such boys as
this.At the battle of Newmarket the scholars of the Virgina Military
Institute, the eldest seventeen and the youngest twelve, marched from the
classrooms under arms, joined the forces of General Breckinridge, and
aided by their historic charge to gain a brilliant victory over the
Federal General Sigel.The never-give-in spirit was implanted in the youth
of the Confederacy, as well as in the hearts of the grizzled veterans.Lee
had inspired them, but in addition to this inspiration, as General Gordon
writes, "every man of them was supported by their extraordinary
consecration, resulting from the conviction that he was fighting in the
defense of home and the rights of his State.Hence their unfaltering faith
in the justice of the cause, their fortitude in the extremest privations,
their readiness to stand shoeless and shivering in the trenches at night
and to face any danger at their leader's call."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.APPOMATTOX

    I now come to what I have always regarded--shall ever regard--as the
    most creditable episode in all American history--an episode without a
    blemish, imposing, dignified, simple, heroic.Two men met that day, representative of American civilization, the
    whole world looking on.The two were Grant and Lee--types each.Both
    rose, and rose unconsciously, to the full height of the occasion--and
    than that occasion there has been none greater.About it, and them,
    there was no theatrical display, no self-consciousness, no effort at
    effect.A great crisis was to be met; and they met that crisis as
    great countrymen should.Consider the possibilities; think for a
    moment of what that day might have been; you will then see cause to
    thank God for much.--_General Charles Francis Adams, U. S. V., in Phi
    Beta Kappa Address delivered at the University of Chicago, June 17,
    1902._


We are now to witness the closing scene of one of the greatest tragedies
ever enacted on the world's stage.Many and varied had been the scenes
during the war; the actors and their parts had been real.The wounds of
the South were bleeding; the North was awaiting the decisive blow.Fortunes, great and small, had melted away
by the hundreds of millions.In Richmond, the citadel of the waning
Confederacy, the people were starving.The Southern army, half clad and
without food, was but a shadow of its once proud self.Bravely and long
the men in gray had followed their adored leader.Now the limit of
endurance had been reached.It was the second day of April, 1865.Lee realized that after Petersburg
his beloved Richmond must fall.The order was given for the movement to
begin at eight o'clock that night.The darkness of the early morning of
the 3d was suddenly transformed into a lurid light overcasting the
heavens for miles around the famous city whose name had became a
household word over the civilized world.The
capital of the Confederacy, the pride of the South, toward which the Army
of the Potomac had fought its way, leaving a trail of blood for four weary
years, had at last succumbed to the overwhelming power of Grant's
indomitable armies.President Davis had received a despatch while attending services at St.Paul's church, Sunday morning, the 2d, advising him that the city must be
evacuated that night, and, leaving the church at once, he hastened the
preparations for flight with his personal papers and the archives of the
Confederate Government.During that Sabbath day and night Richmond was in
a state of riot.There had been an unwarranted feeling of security in the
city, and the unwelcome news, spreading like an electric flash, was
paralyzing and disastrous in its effect.Prisoners were released from
their toils, a lawless mob overran the thoroughfares, and civic government
was nullified.One explosion after another, on the morning of the 3d, rent
the air with deafening roar, as the magazines took fire.The scene was one
of terror and grandeur.The flames spread to the city from the ships, bridges, and arsenal, which
had been set on fire, and hundreds of buildings, including the best
residential section of the capital of the Confederacy, were destroyed.When the Union army entered the city in the morning, thousands of the
inhabitants, men, women, and children, were gathered at street corners and
in the parks, in wildest confusion.The commissary depot had been broken
open by the starving mob, and rifled of its contents, until the place was
reached by the spreading flames.The Federal soldiers stacked arms, and
heroically battled with the fire, drafting into the work all able-bodied
men found in the city.The invaders extinguished the flames, and soon
restored the city to a state of order and safety.The invalid wife of
General Lee, who was exposed to danger, was furnished with an ambulance
and corporal's guard until the danger was past.President Lincoln, who had visited Grant at Petersburg, entered Richmond
on the 4th of April.He visited President Davis' house, and Libby Prison,
then deserted, and held a conference with prominent citizens and army
officers of the Confederacy.The President seemed deeply concerned and
weighted down with the realization of the great responsibilities that
would fall upon him after the war.Only ten days later the nation was
shaken from ocean to ocean by the tragic news of his assassination.General Lee had started on his last march by eight o'clock on the night of
the 2d.By midnight the evacuation of both Petersburg and Richmond was
completed.For nine months the invincible forces of Lee had kept a foe of
more than twice their numerical strength from invading their stronghold,
and only after a long and harassing siege were they forced to retreat.They saw the burning city as their line of march was illuminated by the
conflagration, and emotions too deep for words overcame them.The woods
and fields, in their fresh, bright colors of spring, were in sharp
contrast to the travel-worn, weather-beaten, ragged veterans passing over
the verdant plain.Lee hastened the march of his troops to Amelia Court
House, where he had ordered supplies, but by mistake the train of supplies
had been sent on to Richmond.This was a crushing blow to the hungry men,
who had been stimulated on their tiresome march by the anticipation of
much-needed food.The fatality of war was now hovering over them like a
huge black specter.General Grant did not proceed to Richmond, but leaving General Weitzel to
invest the city, he hastened in pursuit of Lee to intercept the retreating
army.This pursuit was started early on the 3d.On the evening of that
date there was some firing between the pursuing army and Lee's rear guard.It was Lee's design to concentrate his force at Amelia Court House, but
this was not to be accomplished by the night of the 4th.Not until the 5th
was the whole army up, and then it was discovered that no adequate
supplies were within less than fifty miles.Subsistence could be obtained
only by foraging parties.No word of complaint from the suffering men
reached their commander, and on the evening of that disappointing day they
patiently and silently began the sad march anew.Their course was through
unfavorable territory and necessarily slow.The Federals were gaining upon
their retreating columns.Sheridan's cavalry had reached their flank, and
on the 6th there was heavy skirmishing.In the afternoon the Federals had
arrived in force sufficient to bring on an engagement with Ewell's corps
in the rear, at Sailor's Creek, a tributary of the Appomattox River.Ewell
was surrounded by the Federals and the entire corps captured.General
Anderson, commanding the divisions of Pickett and Johnson, was attacked
and fought bravely, losing many men.In all about six thousand Confederate
soldiers were left in the hands of the pursuing army.On the night of the 6th, the remainder of the Confederate army continued
the retreat and arrived at Farmville, where the men received two days'
rations, the first food except raw or parched corn that had been given
them for two days.Again the tedious journey was resumed, in the hope of
breaking through the rapidly-enmeshing net and forming a junction with
Johnston at Danville, or of gaining the protected region of the mountains
near Lynchburg.But the progress of the weak and weary marchers was slow
and the Federal cavalry had swept around to Lee's front, and a halt was
necessary to check the pursuing Federals.On the evening of the 8th, Lee
reached Appomattox Court House.Here ended the last march of the Army of
Northern Virginia.General Lee and his officers held a council of war on the night of the 8th
and it was decided to make an effort to cut their way through the Union
lines on the morning of the next day.On the 7th, while at Farmville, on
the south side of the Appomattox River, Grant sent to Lee a courteous
request for the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, based on the
hopelessness of further resistance on the part of that army.In reply, Lee
expressed sympathy with Grant's desire to avoid useless effusion of blood
and asked the terms of surrender.The next morning General Grant replied to Lee, urging that a meeting be
designated by Lee, and specifying the terms of surrender, to which Lee
replied promptly, rejecting those terms, which were, that the Confederates
lay down their arms, and the men and officers be disqualified for taking
up arms against the Government of the United States until properly
exchanged.When Grant read Lee's letter he shook his head in
disappointment and said, "It looks as if Lee still means to fight; I will
reply in the morning."On the 9th Grant addressed another communication to Lee, repeating the
terms of surrender, and closed by saying, "The terms upon which peace can
be had are well understood.By the South laying down their arms they will
hasten that most desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and
hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed.Sincerely hoping that
all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, I
subscribe myself, etc."There remained for Lee the bare possibility, by desperate fighting, of
breaking through the Federal lines in his rear.To Gordon's corps was
assigned the task of advancing on Sheridan's strongly supported front.Since Pickett's charge at Gettysburg there had been no more hopeless
movement in the annals of the war.It was not merely that Gordon was
overwhelmingly outnumbered by the opposing forces, but his
hunger-enfeebled soldiers, even if successful in the first onslaught,
could count on no effective support, for Longstreet's corps was in even
worse condition than his own.Nevertheless, on the morning of Sunday, the
9th, the attempt was made.Gordon was fighting his corps, as he said, "to
a frazzle," when Lee came at last to a realizing sense of the futility of
it all and ordered a truce.A meeting with Grant was soon arranged on the
basis of the letters already exchanged.The conference of the two
world-famous commanders took place at Appomattox, a small settlement with
only one street, but to be made historic by this meeting.Lee was awaiting
Grant's arrival at the house of Wilmer McLean.It was here, surrounded by
staff-officers, that the terms were written by Grant for the final
surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.The terms, and their
acceptance, were embodied in the following letters, written and signed in
the famous "brick house" on that memorable Sunday:

    APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the
    8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of
    Northern Virginia on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the
    officers and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an
    officer to be designated by me, the other to be retained by such
    officer or officers as you may designate.The officers to give their
    individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the
    United States until properly exchanged; and each company or regimental
    commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands.The
    arms, artillery, and public property to be parked and stacked, and
    turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them.This will
    not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor their private horses or
    baggage.This done, each officer and man will be allowed to return to
    his home, not to be disturbed by the United States authority so long
    as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may
    reside.U. S. GRANT, _Lieutenant-General_.HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: I have received your letter of this date containing the terms
    of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.As they are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter
    of the 8th instant, they are accepted.I will proceed to designate the
    proper officers to carry the stipulation into effect.R. E. LEE, _General_.Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant.When Federal officers were seen galloping toward the Union lines from
Appomattox Court House it was quickly surmised that Lee had surrendered.Cheer after cheer was sent up by the long lines throughout their entire
length; caps and tattered colors were waved in the air.Officers and men
alike joined in the enthusiastic outburst.It was glad tidings, indeed, to
these men, who had fought and hoped and suffered through the long bloody
years.When Grant returned to his headquarters and heard salutes being fired he
ordered it stopped at once, saying, "The war is over; the rebels are our
countrymen again; and the best sign of rejoicing after the victory will be
to abstain from all demonstration in the field."Details of the surrender were arranged on the next day by staff-officers
of the respective armies.The parole officers were instructed by General
Grant to permit the Confederate soldiers to retain their own horses--a
concession that was most welcome to many of the men, who had with them
animals brought from the home farm early in the war.There were only twenty-eight thousand men to be paroled, and of these
fewer than one-third were actually bearing arms on the day of the
surrender.The Confederate losses of the last ten days of fighting
probably exceeded ten thousand.The Confederate supplies had been captured by Sheridan, and Lee's army was
almost at the point of starvation.An order from Grant caused the rations
of the Federal soldiers to be shared with the "Johnnies," and the
victorious "Yanks" were only too glad to tender such hospitality as was
within their power.These acts of kindness were slight in themselves, but
they helped immeasurably to restore good feeling and to associate for all
time with Appomattox the memory of reunion rather than of strife.The
things that were done there can never be the cause of shame to any
American.The noble and dignified bearing of the commanders was an example
to their armies and to the world that quickly had its effect in the
genuine reconciliation that followed.The scene between Lee and his devoted army was profoundly touching.General Long in his "Memoirs of Lee" says: "It is impossible to describe
the anguish of the troops when it was known that the surrender of the army
was inevitable.Of all their trials, this was the greatest and hardest to
endure."As Lee rode along the lines of the tried and faithful men who had
been with him at the Wilderness, at Spotsylvania, and at Cold Harbor, it
was not strange that those ragged, weather-beaten heroes were moved by
deep emotion and that tears streamed down their bronzed and scarred faces.Their general in broken accents admonished them to go to their homes and
be as brave citizens as they had been soldiers.Thus ended the greatest civil war in history, for soon after the fall of
the Confederate capital and the surrender of Lee's army, there followed in
quick succession the surrender of all the remaining Southern forces.While these stirring events were taking place in Virginia, Sherman, who
had swept up through the Carolinas with the same dramatic brilliancy that
marked his march to the sea, accomplishing most effective work against
Johnston, was at Goldsboro.When Johnston learned of the fall of Richmond
and Lee's surrender he knew the end had come and he soon arranged for the
surrender of his army on the terms agreed upon at Appomattox.In the first
week of May General "Dick" Taylor surrendered his command near Mobile, and
on the 10th of the same month, President Jefferson Davis, who had been for
nearly six weeks a fugitive, was overtaken and made a prisoner near
Irwinsville, Georgia.The Southern Confederacy was a thing of the past.[Illustration: MEN ABOUT TO WITNESS APPOMATTOX

No photographer was present at Appomattox, that supreme moment in our
national history, when Americans met for the last time as foes on the
field.Nothing but fanciful sketches exist of the scene inside the McLean
home.But here is a photograph that shows most of the Union officers
present at the conference.Nine of the twelve men standing above stood
also at the signing of Lee's surrender, a few days later.The scene is
City Point, in March, 1865.Grant is surrounded by a group of the officers
who had served him so faithfully.At the surrender, it was Colonel T. S.
Bowers (third from left) upon whom Grant called to make a copy of the
terms of surrender in ink.Colonel E. S. Parker, the full-blooded Indian
on Grant's staff, an excellent penman, wrote out the final copy.Nineteen
years later, General Horace Porter recorded with pride that he loaned
General Lee a pencil to make a correction in the terms.Colonels William
Duff and J. D. Webster, and General M. R. Patrick, are the three men who
were not present at the interview.All of the remaining officers were
formally presented to Lee.General Seth Williams had been Lee's adjutant
when the latter was superintendent at West Point some years before the
war.In the lower photograph General Grant stands between General Rawlins
and Colonel Bowers.The veins standing out on the back of his hand are
plainly visible.No one but he could have told how calmly the blood
coursed through them during the four tremendous years.[Illustration: GRANT BETWEEN RAWLINS AND BOWERS]


[Illustration: IN PETERSBURG--AFTER NINE MONTHS OF BATTERING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This fine mansion on Bolingbroke Street, the residential section of
Petersburg, has now, on the 3d of April, fallen into the hands of
straggling Union soldiers.Its windows have long since been shattered by
shells from distant Federal mortars; one has even burst through the wall.But it was not till the night of April 2d, when the retreat of the
Confederate forces started, that the citizens began to leave their homes.At 9 o'clock in the morning General Grant, surrounded by his staff, rode
quietly into the city.At length they arrived
at a comfortable home standing back in a yard.There he dismounted and sat
for a while on the piazza.Soon a group of curious citizens gathered on
the sidewalk to gaze at the commander of the Yankee armies.But the Union
troops did not remain long in the deserted homes.Sheridan was already in
pursuit south of the Appomattox, and Grant, after a short conference with
Lincoln, rode to the west in the rear of the hastily marching troops.Bolingbroke Street and Petersburg soon returned to the ordinary
occupations of peace in an effort to repair the ravages of the historic
nine months' siege.[Illustration: APPOMATTOX STATION--LEE'S LAST ATTEMPT TO PROVISION HIS

being loaded into wagons and ambulances by a detail of about four thousand

upon them, having reached the spot by a by-road leading from the Red
House.After a few shots the Confederates fled in confusion.The cavalry
drove them on in the direction of Appomattox Court House, capturing many
prisoners, twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train, and a large
pack of wagons.This was Lee's last effort to obtain food for his army.[Illustration: FEDERAL SOLDIERS WHO PERFORMED ONE OF THE LAST DUTIES AT

The sad significance of these photographs is all too apparent.Not only
the bank buildings were in ruins, but the financial system of the entire
South.All available capital had been consumed by the demands of the war,
and a system of paper currency had destroyed credit completely.Worse
still was the demoralization of all industry.Through large areas of the
South all mills and factories were reduced to ashes, and everywhere the
industrial system was turned topsy-turvy.Truly the problem that
confronted the South was stupendous.[Illustration: WRECK OF THE GALLEGO FLOUR MILLS

captured in the defenses about Richmond are parked near the wharves on the
James River ready for shipment to the national arsenal at Washington, once
more the capital of a united country.The reflection of these instruments
of destruction on the peaceful surface of the canal is not more clear than
was the purpose of the South to accept the issues of the war and to
restore as far as in them lay the bases for an enduring prosperity.The
same devotion which manned these guns so bravely and prolonged the contest
as long as it was possible for human powers to endure, was now directed to
the new problems which the cessation of hostilities had provided.The
restored Union came with the years to possess for the South a significance
to be measured only by the thankfulness that the outcome had been what it
was and by the pride in the common traditions and common blood of the
whole American people.These captured guns are a memory therefore, not of
regret, but of recognition, gratitude, that the highest earthly tribunal
settled all strife in 1865.[Illustration: COEHORNS, MORTARS, LIGHT AND HEAVY GUNS]


[Illustration: LINCOLN THE LAST SITTING--ON THE DAY OF LEE'S SURRENDER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On April 9, 1865, the very day of the surrender of Lee at Appomattox,
Lincoln, for the last time, went to the photographer's gallery.As he sits
in simple fashion sharpening his pencil, the man of sorrows cannot forget
the sense of weariness and pain that for four years has been unbroken.No
elation of triumph lights the features.One task is ended--the Nation is
saved.But another, scarcely less exacting, confronts him.The States
which lay "out of their proper practical relation to the Union," in his
own phrase, must be brought back into a proper practical relation.Only five days later the sad eyes reflected
upon this page closed forever upon scenes of earthly turmoil.Bereft of
Lincoln's heart and head, leaders attacked problems of reconstruction in
ways that proved unwise.As the mists of passion and prejudice cleared
away, both North and South came to feel that this patient, wise, and
sympathetic ruler was one of the few really great men in history, and that
he would live forever in the hearts of men made better by his presence
during those four years of storm.[Illustration: THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIERS--THE GRAND REVIEW

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.One of the proudest days of the nation--May 24, 1865--here lives again.The true greatness of the American people was not displayed till the close
of the war.The citizen from the walks of humble life had during the
contest become a veteran soldier, equal in courage and fighting capacity
to the best drilled infantry of Marlborough, Frederick the Great, or
Napoleon.But it remained to be seen whether he would return peacefully to
the occupations of peace."Would
nearly a million men," they asked, "one of the mightiest military
organizations ever trained in war, quietly lay aside this resistless power
and disappear into the unnoted walks of civil life?"The disbanded veterans
lent the effectiveness of military order and discipline to the industrial
and commercial development of the land they had come to love with an
increased devotion.The pictures are of Sherman's troops marching down
Pennsylvania Avenue.The horsemen in the lead are General Francis P. Blair
and his staff, and the infantry in flashing new uniforms are part of the
Seventeenth Corps in the Army of Tennessee.Little over a year before,
they had started with Sherman on his series of battles and flanking
marches in the struggle for Atlanta.They had taken a conspicuous and
important part in the battle of July 22d east of Atlanta, receiving and
finally repulsing attacks in both front and rear.They had marched with
Sherman to the sea and participated in the capture of Savannah.They had
joined in the campaign through the Carolinas, part of the time leading the
advance and tearing up many miles of railway track, and operating on the
extreme right after the battle of Bentonville.After the negotiations for
Johnston's surrender were completed in April, they set out on the march
for the last time with flying colors and martial music, to enter the
memorable review at Washington in May, here preserved.[Illustration: THE SAME SCENE, A FEW SECONDS LATER

WARNING COLORS.--Very complete experiments in support of the theory
of warning colors, first suggested by Bates and also by Wallace, have
been made in India by Mr.He concludes
that there is a general appetite for Butterflies among insectivorous
birds, though they are rarely seen when wild to attack them; also that
many, probably most birds, dislike, if not intensely, at any rate
in comparison with other Butterflies, those of the Danais genus and
three other kinds, including a species of Papilio, which is the most
distasteful.The mimics of these Butterflies are relatively palatable.He found that each bird has to separately acquire its experience with
bad-tasting Butterflies, but well remembers what it learns.He also
experimented with Lizards, and noticed that, unlike the birds, they ate
the nauseous as well as other Butterflies.----

INCREASE IN ZOOLOGICAL PRESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES--The
establishment of the National Zoological Park, Washington, has led
to the formation of many other zoological preserves in the United
States.In the western part of New Hampshire is an area of 26,000
acres, established by the late Austin Corbin, and containing 74 Bison,
200 Moose, 1,500 Elk, 1,700 Deer of different species, and 150 Wild
Boar, all of which are rapidly multiplying.In the Adirondacks, a
preserve of 9,000 acres has been stocked with Elk, Virginia Deer,
Muledeer, Rabbits, and Pheasants.The same animals are preserved by W.
C. Whitney on an estate of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire Hills, near
Lenox, Mass., where also he keeps Bison and Antelope.Other preserves
are Nehasane Park, in the Adirondacks, 8,000 acres; Tranquillity Park,
near Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000 acres; the Alling preserve, near Tacoma,
Washington, 5,000 acres; North Lodge, near St.Paul, Minn., 400 acres;
and Furlough Lodge, in the Catskills, N. Y., 600 acres.----

ROBINS ABUNDANT--Not for many years have these birds been so numerous
as during 1898.Once, under some wide-spreading willow trees, where the
ground was bare and soft, we counted about forty Red-breasts feeding
together, and on several occasions during the summer we saw so many in
flocks, that we could only guess at the number.When unmolested, few
birds become so tame and none are more interesting.East of the Missouri River the Gray Squirrel is found almost
everywhere, and is perhaps the most common variety.Wherever there is
timber it is almost sure to be met with, and in many localities is very
abundant, especially where it has had an opportunity to breed without
unusual disturbance.Its usual color is pale gray above and white or
yellowish white beneath, but individuals of the species grade from this
color through all the stages to jet black.Gray and black Squirrels
are often found associating together.They are said to be in every
respect alike, in the anatomy of their bodies, habits, and in every
detail excepting the color, and by many sportsmen they are regarded as
distinct species, and that the black form is merely due to melanism,
an anomaly not uncommon among animals.Whether this be the correct
explanation may well be left to further scientific observation.Like all the family, the Gray Squirrels feed in the early morning
just after sunrise and remain during the middle of the day in their
hole or nest.It is in the early morning or the late afternoon, when
they again appear in search of the evening meal, that the wise hunter
lies in wait for them.Then they may be heard and seen playing and
chattering together till twilight.Sitting upright and motionless
on a log the intruder will rarely be discovered by them, but at the
slightest movement they scamper away, hardly to return.This fact is
taken advantage of by the sportsmen, and, says an observer, be he
at all familiar with the runways of the Squirrels at any particular
locality he may sit by the path and bag a goodly number.Gray and Black
Squirrels generally breed twice during the spring and summer, and have
several young at a litter.We have been told that an incident of migration of Squirrels of a very
remarkable kind occurred a good many years ago, caused by lack of mast
and other food, in New York State.When the creatures arrived at the
Niagara river, their apparent destination being Canada, they seemed
to hesitate before attempting to cross the swift running stream.The
current is very rapid, exceeding seven miles an hour.They finally
ventured in the water, however, and with tails spread for sails,
succeeded in making the opposite shore, but more than a mile below the
point of entrance.They are better swimmers than one would fancy them
to be, as they have much strength and endurance.We remember when a
boy seeing some mischievous urchins repeatedly throw a tame Squirrel
into deep water for the cruel pleasure of watching it swim ashore.The
"sport" was soon stopped, however, by a passerby, who administered a
rebuke that could hardly be forgotten.Squirrels are frequently domesticated and become as tame as any
household tabby.Unfortunately Dogs and Cats seem to show a relentless
enmity toward them, as they do toward all rodents.The Squirrel is
willing to be friendly, and no doubt would gladly affiliate with
them, but the instinct of the canine and the feline impels them to
exterminate it.We once gave shelter and food to a strange Cat and
was rewarded by seeing it fiercely attack and kill a beautiful white
Rabbit which until then had had the run of the yard and never before
been molested.Until we shall be able to teach the beasts of the field
something of our sentimental humanitarianism we can scarcely expect to
see examples of cruelty wholly disappear.I killed a Robin--the little thing,
    With scarlet breast on a glossy wing,
      That comes in the apple tree to sing.I flung a stone as he twittered there,
      I only meant to give him a scare,
      But off it went--and hit him square.A little flutter--a little cry--
      Then on the ground I saw him lie.I didn't think he was going to die.But as I watched him I soon could see
      He never would sing for you or me
      Any more in the apple tree.Never more in the morning light,
      Never more in the sunshine bright,
      Trilling his song in gay delight.And I'm thinking, every summer day,
      How never, never, I can repay
      The little life that I took away.--SYDNEY DAYRE, in The Youth's Companion.THE PECTORAL SANDPIPER.More than a score of Sandpipers are described in the various works
on ornithology.The one presented here, however, is perhaps the most
curious specimen, distributed throughout North, Central, and South
America, breeding in the Arctic regions.It is also of frequent
occurrence in Europe.Low, wet lands, muddy flats, and the edges
of shallow pools of water are its favorite resorts.The birds move
in flocks, but, while feeding, scatter as they move about, picking
and probing here and there for their food, which consists of worms,
insects, small shell fish, tender rootlets, and birds; "but at the
report of a gun," says Col.Goss, "or any sudden fright, spring into
the air, utter a low whistling note, quickly bunch together, flying
swift and strong, usually in a zigzag manner, and when not much hunted
often circle and drop back within shot; for they are not naturally
a timid or suspicious bird, and when quietly and slowly approached,
sometimes try to hide by squatting close to the ground."Of the Pectoral Sandpiper's nesting habits, little has been known until
recently.Nelson's interesting description, in his report upon
"Natural History Collections in Alaska," we quote as follows: "The
night of May 24, 1889, I lay wrapped in my blanket, and from the raised
flap of the tent looked out over as dreary a cloud-covered landscape as
can be imagined.As my eyelids began to droop and the scene to become
indistinct, suddenly a low, hollow, booming note struck my ear and
sent my thoughts back to a spring morning in northern Illinois, and
to the loud vibrating tones of the Prairie Chickens.[See BIRDS AND
ALL NATURE, Vol.Again the sound arose, nearer and more
distinct, and with an effort I brought myself back to the reality of my
position, and, resting upon one elbow, listened.A few seconds passed,
and again arose the note; a moment later I stood outside the tent.The
open flat extended away on all sides, with apparently not a living
creature near.Once again the note was repeated close by, and a glance
revealed its author.Standing in the thin grass ten or fifteen yards
from me, with its throat inflated until it was as large as the rest of
the bird, was a male Pectoral Sandpiper.The succeeding days afforded
opportunity to observe the bird as it uttered its singular notes, under
a variety of situations, and at various hours of the day, or during the
light Arctic night.The note is deep, hollow, and resonant, but at the
same time liquid and musical, and may be represented by a repetition of
the syllables _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_."The bird
may frequently be seen running along the ground close to the female,
its enormous sac inflated.Murdock says the birds breed in abundance at Point Barrow, Alaska,
and that the nest is always built in the grass, with a preference for
high and dry localities.The nest was like that of the other waders, a
depression in the ground, lined with a little dry grass.The eggs are
four, of pale purplish-gray and light neutral tint.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.Why was the sight
    To such a tender ball as th' eye confined,
    So obvious and so easy to be quenched,
    And not, as feeling, through all parts diffused;
    That she might look at will through every pore?--MILTON."But bein' only eyes, you see, my wision's limited."The reason we know anything at all is that various forms of vibration
are capable of affecting our organs of sense.These agitate the brain,
the mind perceives, and from perception arise the higher forms of
thought.Perhaps the most important of the senses is sight.It ranges
in power from the mere ability to perceive the difference between light
and darkness up to a marvelous means of knowing the nature of objects
of various forms and sizes, at both near and remote range.One the simplest forms of eyes is found in the Sea-anemone.It has a
 mass of pigment cells and refractive bodies that break up the
light which falls upon them, and it is able to know day and night.An examination of this simple organ leads one to think the scientist
not far wrong who claimed that the eye is a development from what was
once merely a particular sore spot that was sensitive to the action
of light.The protophyte, _Euglena varidis_, has what seems to be the
least complicated of all sense organs in the transparent spot in the
front of its body.We know that rays of light have power to alter the color of certain
substances.The retina of the eye is changed in color by exposure to
continued rays of light.Frogs in whose eyes the color of the retina
has apparently been all changed by sunshine are still able to take a
fly accurately and to recognize certain colors.Whether the changes produced by light upon the retina are all chemical
or all physical or partly both remains open to discussion.An interesting experiment was performed by Professor Tyndall proving
that heat rays do not affect the eye optically.He was operating along
the line of testing the power of the eye to transmit to the sensorium
the presence of certain forms of radiant energy.It is well known that
certain waves are unnoticed by the eye but are registered distinctly
by the photographic plate, and he first showed beyond doubt that heat
waves as such have no effect upon the retina.By separating the light
and heat rays from an electric lantern and focusing the latter, he
brought their combined energy to play where his own eye could be placed
directly in contact with them, first protecting the exterior of his
eye from the heat rays.There was no sensation whatever as a result,
but when, directly afterward, he placed a sheet of platinum at the
convergence of the dark rays it quickly became red hot with the energy
which his eye was unable to recognize.The eye is a camera obscura with a very imperfect lens and a receiving
plate irregularly sensitized; but it has marvelous powers of quick
adjustment.The habits of the animal determine the character of the
eye.Birds of rapid flight and those which scan the earth minutely
from lofty courses are able to adjust their vision quickly to long and
short range.The eye of the Owl is subject to his will as he swings
noiselessly down upon the Mouse in the grass.The nearer the object the
more the eye is protruded and the deeper its form from front to rear.The human eye adjusts its power well for small objects within a few
inches and readily reaches out for those several miles away.A curious
feature is that we are able to adjust the eye for something at long
range in less time than for something close at hand.If we are reading
and someone calls our attention to an object on the distant hillside,
the eye adjusts itself to the distance in less than a second, but when
we return our vision to the printed page several seconds are consumed
in the re-adjustment.The Condor of the Andes has great powers of sight.He wheels in
beautiful curves high in the air scrutinizing the ground most carefully
and all the time apparently keeping track of all the other Condors
within a range of several miles.No sooner does one of his kind descend
to the earth than those near him shoot for the same spot hoping the
find may be large enough for a dinner party.Others soaring at greater
distances note their departure and follow in great numbers so that when
the carcass discovered by one Condor proves to be a large one, hundreds
of these huge birds congregate to enjoy the feast.The Condor's
eyes have been well compared to opera glasses, their extension and
contraction are so great.The Eagle soars towards the sun with fixed gaze and apparent fullness
of enjoyment.This would ruin his sight were it not for the fact
that he and all other birds are provided with an extra inner eyelid
called the nictitating membrane which may be drawn at will over the
eye to protect it from too strong a light.Cuvier made the discovery
that the eye of the Eagle, which had up to his time been supposed of
peculiarly great strength to enable it to feast upon the sun's rays, is
closed during its great flights just as the eye of the barnyard fowl
is occasionally rested by the use of this delicate semi-transparent
membrane.Several of the mammals, among them being the horse, are
equipped with such an inner eyelid.One of my most striking experiences on the ocean was had when I pulled
in my first Flounder and found both of his eyes on the same side of
his head.On the side which
glides over the bottom of the sea, the Halibut, Turbot, Plaice, and
Sole are almost white, the upper side being dark enough to be scarcely
distinguishable from the ground.On the upper side are the two eyes,
while the lower side is blind.When first born the fish swims upright with a slight tendency to favor
one side; its eyes are on opposite sides of the head, as in most
vertebrates and the head itself is regular.With age and experience in
exploring the bottom on one side, the under eye refuses to remain away
from the light and gradually turns upward, bringing with it the bones
of the skull to such an extent that the adult Flat-fish becomes the
apparently deformed creature that appears in our markets as a regular
product of the deep.The eyeless inhabitant of the streams in Mammoth Cave presents a
curious instance of the total loss of a sense which remains unused.These little fishes are not only without sight but are also almost
destitute of color and markings, the general appearance being much like
that of a fish with the skin taken off for the frying pan.The eyes of fishes generally are so nearly round that they may be used
with good effect as simple microscopes and have considerable magnifying
power.Being continually washed with the element in which they move,
they have no need for winking and the lachrymal duct which supplies
tears to the eyes of most of the animal kingdom is entirely wanting.Whales have no tear glands in their eyes, and the whole order of
Cetacea are tearless.Among domestic animals there is considerable variety of structure in
the eye.The pupil is usually round, but in the small Cats it is long
vertically, and in the Sheep, in fact, in all the cud chewers and many
other grass eaters, the pupil is long horizontally.Insects present a wonderful array of eyes.These are not movable, but
the evident purpose is that there shall be an eye in readiness in
whatever direction the insect may have business.The common Ant has
fifty six-cornered jewels set advantageously in his little head and
so arranged as to take in everything that pertains to the pleasure of
the industrious little creature.As the Ant does not move about with
great rapidity he is less in need of many eyes than the House-fly which
calls into play four thousand brilliant facets, while the Butterfly
is supplied with about seventeen thousand.The most remarkable of all
is the blundering Beetle which bangs his head against the wall with
twenty-five thousand eyes wide open.Then as a nimble Squirrel from the wood
      Ranging the hedges for his filbert food
      Sits pertly on a bough, his brown nuts cracking
      And from the shell the sweet white kernel taking;
    Till with their crooks and bags a sort of boys
    To share with him come with so great a noise
    That he is forced to leave a nut nigh broke,
    And for his life leap to a neighbor oak,
    Thence to a beech, thence to a row of ashes;
    Whilst through the quagmires and red water plashes
    The boys run dabbing through thick and thin.One tears his hose, another breaks his shin;
    This, torn and tattered, hath with much ado
    Got by the briars; and that hath lost his shoe;
    This drops his band; that headlong falls for haste;
    Another cries behind for being last;
    With sticks and stones and many a sounding holloa
    The little fool with no small sport they follow,
    Whilst he from tree to tree, from spray to spray
    Gets to the woods and hides him in his dray.--WILLIAM BROWNE,

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Birds and all Nature, Vol.As yet, we know comparatively little of either material or
spiritual laws, and we cannot be surprised that we know still less of
Sacramental laws.We are in the student stage, and are perpetually
revising our conclusions.{62} In all three cases, we very largely
"walk by faith".But this at least we may say of Sacraments.Matter without spirit
cannot effect that which matter with spirit can, and does, effect.As
in the Incarnation, God[7] expresses Himself through matter[8]--so it
is in the Sacraments.In Baptism, the Holy Spirit "expresses Himself"
through water: in the Eucharist, through bread and wine.In each case,
the perfect integrity of matter and of spirit are essential to the
validity of the Sacrament.In each case, it is the conjunction of the
two which guarantees the full effect of either.[9]



(III) THE NAMES OF THE SACRAMENTS.As given in the Prayer Book, these are seven--"Baptism, and the Supper
of the Lord," Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Unction.Leo defines a Sacrament thus: "_Sacramentum_.(1) It
originally signified the pledge or deposit in money which in certain
suits according to Roman Law plaintiff and defendant were alike bound
to make; (2) it came to signify a pledge of military fidelity, a
_voluntary_ oath; (3) then the _exacted_ oath of allegiance; (4) any
oath whatever; (5) in early Christian use any sacred or solemn act, and
especially any mystery where more was meant than met the ear or eye"
(Blight's "Select Sermons of St.[5] The answer is borrowed from Peter Lombard (a pupil of Abelard and
Professor of Theology, and for a short time Bishop of Paris), who
defines a Sacrament as a "visible sign of an invisible grace," probably
himself borrowing the thought from St.Illingworth calls "the material order another aspect of the
spiritual, which is gradually revealing itself through material
concealment, in the greater and lesser Christian Sacraments, which
radiate from the Incarnation" ("Sermons Preached in a College Chapel,"
p.[7] God is _Spirit_, St.[8] The Word was made _Flesh_, St.[9] The water in Baptism is not, of course, _consecrated_, as the bread
and wine are in the Eucharist.It does not, like the bread and wine,
"become what it was not, without ceasing to be what it was," but it is
"_sanctified_ to the mystical washing away of sins".{63}

CHAPTER V.

BAPTISM.Consider, What it is;
          What it does;
          How it does it.The Sacrament of Baptism is the supernatural conjunction of matter and
spirit--of water and the Holy Ghost.Water must be there, and spirit
must be there.It is by the conjunction of the two that the Baptized
is "born anew of water and of the Holy Ghost".At the reception of a privately baptized
child into the Church, it is laid down that "matter" and "words" are
the two essentials for a valid Baptism.[1]  "Because some things
essential to this Sacrament may happen to be omitted (and thus
invalidate the Sacrament),... I demand," says the priest, {64} "with
what matter was this child baptized?"and "with what words was this
child baptized?"And because the omission of right matter or right
words would invalidate the Sacrament, further inquiry is made, and the
god-parents are asked: "by whom was this child baptized?": "who was
present when this child was baptized?"Additional security is taken,
if there is the slightest reason to question the evidence given.The
child is then given "Conditional Baptism," and Baptism is administered
with the conditional words: "If thou art not already baptized,"--for
Baptism cannot be repeated--"I baptize thee in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.So careful is the
Church both in administering and guarding the essentials of the
Sacrament.And notice: nothing but the water and the words are _essential_.Other
things may, or may not, be edifying; they are not essential; they are
matters of ecclesiastical regulation, not of Divine appointment.Thus,
a _Priest_ is not essential to a valid Baptism, as he is for a valid
Eucharist.A Priest is the normal, but not the necessary, instrument
of Baptism."In the absence of a {65} Priest"[2] a Deacon may baptize,
and if the child is _in extremis_, any one, of either sex, may baptize.Again, _Sponsors_ are not essential to the validity of the Sacrament.They are only a part--an
invaluable part--of ecclesiastical regulation.When, in times of
persecution, parents might be put to death, other parents were chosen
as parents-in-God (God-parents)[3] to safeguard the child's Christian
career.Sponsors are "sureties" of the Church, not parts of the
Sacraments.They stand at the font, as fully admitted Church members,
to welcome a new member into the Brotherhood.But a private Baptism
without Sponsors would be a valid Baptism.So, too, in regard to _Ceremonial_.The mode of administering the
Sacrament may vary: it is not (apart from the matter and words) of the
essence of the Sacrament.There are, in fact, three ways in which
Baptism may be validly administered.It may be administered by
_Immersion_, _Aspersion_, or _Affusion_.Immersion (_in-mergere_, to dip into) is the original and primitive
form of administration.{66} As the word suggests, it consists of
dipping the candidate into the water--river, bath, or font.Aspersion (_ad spargere_, to sprinkle upon) is not a primitive form of
administration.It consists in sprinkling water upon the candidate's
forehead.Affusion (_ad fundere_, to pour upon) is the allowed alternative to
Immersion.Immersion was the Apostolic method, and
explains most vividly the Apostolic teaching (in which the Candidate is
"buried with Christ" by immersion, and rises again by emersion)[4] no
less than the meaning of the word--from the Greek _baptizo_, to dip.Provision for Immersion has been made by a Fontgrave, in Lambeth Parish
Church, erected in memory of Archbishop Benson, and constantly made use
of.But, even in Apostolic times, Baptism by "Affusion" was allowed to
the sick and was equally valid.In the Prayer Book, affusion is either
permitted (as in the Public Baptism of infants), or ordered (as in the
Private Baptism of infants), or, again, allowed (as in the Baptism of
those of riper years).It will be {67} noted that the Church of
England makes no allusion to "Aspersion," or the "sprinkling" form of
administration.The child or adult is always either to be dipped into
the water, or to have water poured upon it.[5]  Other ceremonies there
are--ancient and mediaeval.Some are full of beauty, but none are
essential.Thus, in the first Prayer Book of 1549, a white vesture,
called the _Chrisome_[6] or _Chrism_, was put upon the candidate, the
Priest saying: "Take this white vesture for a token of innocency which,
by God's grace, in the Holy Sacrament of Baptism, is given unto thee".It typified the white life to which the one anointed with the Chrisma,
or symbolical oil, was dedicated.[7]

{68}

Another ancient custom was to give the newly baptized _milk and honey_.Clement of Alexandria writes: "As soon as we are born again, we
become entitled to the hope of rest, the promise of Jerusalem which is
above, where it is said to rain milk and honey"._Consignation_, again, or the "signing with the sign of the cross,"
dates from a very early period.[8]  It marks the child as belonging to
the Good Shepherd, even as a lamb is marked with the owner's mark or
sign.Giving salt as a symbol of wisdom (_sal sapientiae_); placing a lighted
taper in the child's hand, typifying the illuminating Spirit; turning
to the west to renounce the enemy of the Faith, and then to the east to
recite our belief in that Faith; striking three blows with the hand,
symbolical of fighting against the world, the flesh, and the devil: all
such ceremonies, and many more, have their due place, and mystic
meaning: but they are not part of the Sacrament.They are, {69} as it
were, scenery, beautiful scenery, round the Sacrament; frescoes on the
walls; the "beauty of holiness"; "lily-work upon the top of the
pillars";[9] the handmaids of the Sacrament, but not essential to the
Sacrament.To deny that the Church of England rightly and duly
administers the Sacrament because she omits any one of these
ceremonies, is to confuse the picture with the frame, the jewel with
its setting, the beautiful with the essential.[10]

We may deplore the loss of this or that Ceremony, but a National Church
exercises her undoubted right in saying at any particular period of her
history how the Sacrament is to be administered, provided the
essentials of the Sacrament are left untouched.The Church Universal
decides, once for all, what is essential: {70} the National Church
decides how best to secure and safeguard these essentials for her own
_Use_.According to the Scriptures, "_Baptism doth now save us_".[11]  As God
did "save Noah and his family in the Ark from perishing by water," so
does God save the human family from perishing by sin.As Noah and his
family could, by an act of free will, have opened a window in the Ark,
and have leapt into the waters, and frustrated God's purpose after they
had been saved, so can any member of the human family, after it has
been taken into the "Ark of Christ's Church," frustrate God's "good
will towards" it, and wilfully leap out of its saving shelter.Baptism
is "a beginning," not an end.[12]  It puts us into a state of
Salvation.Cyprian says
that in Baptism "we start crowned," and St.John says: "Hold fast that
which thou hast that no man take thy crown".[13] Baptism is the
Sacrament of initiation, not of finality.Directly the child is
baptized, we pray that he "may lead the rest of his life according {71}
to _this beginning_," and we heartily thank God for having, in Baptism,
called us into a state of Salvation.In this sense, "Baptism doth save
us".In the Nicene Creed we say: "I
believe in one Baptism for the remission of _sins_".Baptism saves us
from our sins.In the case of infants, Baptism saves from original, or inherited,
sin--the sin whose origin can be traced to the Fall.In the case of
adults, Baptism saves from both original and actual sin, both birth sin
and life sin.The Prayer Book is as explicit as the Bible on this point.In the case
of infants, we pray:

"We call upon Thee for this infant, that he, _coming to Thy Holy
Baptism_, may receive remission of his sins"--before, i.e., the child
has, by free will choice, committed actual sin.In the case of adults,
we read: "Well-beloved, who are come hither desiring _to receive Holy
Baptism_, ye have heard how the congregation hath prayed, that our Lord
Jesus Christ would vouchsafe to... _release you of your sins_".And,
again, dealing with infants, the Rubric at the end of the "Public
Baptism of Infants" declares that "It is certain, by God's Word, that
children _who are {72} baptized_, dying before they commit _actual
sin_, are undoubtedly saved".In affirming this, the Church does not condemn all the unbaptized,
infants or adults, to everlasting perdition, as the teaching of some
is.Every affirmation does not necessarily involve its opposite
negation.It was thousands of years before any souls at all were
baptized on earth, and even now, few[14] in comparison with the total
population of the civilized and uncivilized world, have been baptized.The Church nowhere assumes the self-imposed burden of legislation for
these, or limits their chance of salvation to the Church Militant.What she does do, is to proclaim her unswerving belief in "one Baptism
for the remission of sins"; and her unfailing faith in God's promises
to those who _are_ baptized--"which promise, He, for His part, will
most surely keep and perform".On this point, she speaks with nothing
short of "undoubted certainty"; on the other point, she is silent.She
does not condemn an infant because no responsible person has brought it
to Baptism, though she does condemn the person for not bringing it.She does not limit {73} the power of grace to souls in this life only,
but she does offer grace in this world, which may land the soul safely
in the world to come.Making the child a member of Christ, it
gives it a "Christ-ian" name.This Christian, or fore-name as it was called, is the real name.It
antedates the surname by many centuries, surnames being unknown in
England before the Norman invasion.The Christian name is the
Christ-name.It cannot, by any known legal method, be changed.Surnames may be changed in various legal ways: not so the Christian
name.[15]  This was more apparent when the baptized were given only one
Christian name, for it was not until the eighteenth century that a
second or third name was added, and then only on grounds of convenience.Again, according to the law of England, the only legal way in which a
Christian name can be given, is by Baptism.Thus, if a child has been
registered in one name, and is afterwards baptized {74} in another, the
Baptismal, and not the registered, name is its legal name, even if the
registered name was given first.It is strange that, in view of all this, peers should drop their
Christian names, i.e.their real names, their Baptismal names.The
custom, apparently, dates only from the Stuart period, and is not easy
to account for.The same
loss, if it be a loss, is incurred by the Town Clerk of London, who
omits his Christian name in signing official documents.[16]  The King,
more happily, retains his Baptismal or Christian name, and has no
surname.[17]  Bishops sign themselves by both their {75} Christian and
official name, as "Randall Cantuar; Cosmo Ebor.; A. F. London; H. E.
Winton; F.We may consider three words, both helps and puzzles, used in connexion
with Holy Baptism: _Regeneration, Adoption, Election_.Each has its
own separate teaching, though there are points at which their meanings
run into each other."We yield Thee hearty thanks that it hath pleased Thee to regenerate
this infant."So runs the Prayer-Book thanksgiving after baptism.The word regeneration comes from two Latin words,
_re_, again, _generare_, to generate, and means exactly what it says.In Prayer-Book language, it means being "_born again_".And, notice,
it refers to infants as well {76} as to adults.The new birth is as
independent of the child's choice as the natural birth.And this is just what we should expect from a God of love.The child
is not consulted about his first birth, neither is he consulted about
his second birth.He does not wait (as the Baptists teach) until he is
old enough to make a free choice of second birth, but as soon as he is
born into the world ("within seven or fourteen days," the Prayer Book
orders) he is reborn into the Church.Grace does not let nature get
ten to twenty years' start, but gives the soul a fair chance from the
very first: and so, and only so, is a God of love "justified in His
saying, and clear when He is judged".The Baptismal Thanksgiving calls the
Baptized "God's own child by Adoption".A simple illustration will
best explain the word.When a man is "naturalized," he speaks of his
new country as the land of his _adoption_.If a Frenchman becomes a
naturalized Englishman, he ceases legally to be a Frenchman; ceases to
be under French law; ceases to serve in the French army.He {77}
becomes legally an Englishman; he is under English law; serves in the
English army; has all the privileges and obligations of a "new-born"
Englishman.He may turn out to be a bad Englishman, a traitor to his
adopted country; he may even hanker after his old life as a
Frenchman--but he has left one kingdom for another, and, good, bad, or
indifferent, he is a subject of his new King; he is a son of his
adopted country.He cannot belong to two kingdoms, serve under two
kings, live under two sets of laws, at the same time.He has been "adopted" into a new kingdom.He is a subject of "the Kingdom of Heaven".But he cannot belong to
two kingdoms at the same time.His "death unto sin" involves a "new
birth (regeneration) unto righteousness".He ceases to be a member of
the old kingdom, to serve under the sway of the old king, to be a
"child of wrath".He renounces all allegiance to Satan; he becomes
God's own child by "adoption".He may be a good, bad, or indifferent
child; he may be a lost child, but he does not cease to be God's child.Rather, it is just because he is still God's child that there is hope
for him.It is because he is {78} the child of God by adoption that
the "spirit of adoption" within him can still cry, "Abba, Father," that
he can still claim the privilege of his adopted country, and "pardon
through the Precious Blood".True, he has obligations and
responsibilities, as well as privileges, and these we shall see under
the next word, Election.The Catechism calls the Baptized "the elect people of God," and the
Baptismal Service asks that the child may by Baptism be "taken into the
number of God's elect children".The word itself
comes from two Latin words, _e_, or _ex_, out; and _lego_, to choose.The "elect," then, are those chosen out from others.It sounds like
favouritism; it reads like "privileged classes"--and so it is.But the
privilege of election is the privilege of service.It is like the
privilege of a Member of Parliament, the favoured candidate--the
privilege of being elected to serve others.Every election is for the
sake of somebody else.The Member of Parliament is elected for the
sake of his constituents; the Town Councillor is elected for the sake
of his fellow-townsmen; the Governor is elected for the sake of the
{79} governed.The Jews were
"elect"; but it was for the sake of the Gentiles--"that the Gentiles,
through them, might be brought in".The Blessed Virgin was "elect";
but it was that "all generations might call her blessed".The Church
is "elect," but it is for the sake of the world,--that it, too, might
be "brought in".The Baptized are
"elect," but not for their own sakes; not to be a privileged class,
save to enjoy the privilege of bringing others in.They are "chosen
out" of the world for the sake of those left in the world.This is
their obligation; it is the law of their adopted country, the kingdom
into which they have, "by spiritual regeneration," been "born again".All this, and much more, Baptism does.How Baptism
causes all that it effects, is as yet unrevealed.The Holy Ghost moves
upon the face of the waters, but His operation is overshadowed.Here,
we are in the realm of faith.Faith is belief in that which is out of
{80} sight.It is belief in the unseen, not in the non-existent.We
hope for that we see not.[18]  The _mode_ of the operation of the Holy
Ghost in Baptism is hidden: the result alone is revealed.In this, as
in many another mystery, "We wait for light".[19]



[1] See Service for the "Private Baptism of Children".[2] Service for the Ordination of Deacons.[3] From an old word, Gossip or _Godsib_, i.e.[5] _Trine_ Immersion, i.e.dipping the candidate thrice, or thrice
pouring water upon him, dates from the earliest ages, but exceptional
cases have occurred where a single immersion has been held valid.[6] From _Chrisma_, sacred oil--first the oil with which a child was
anointed at Baptism, and then the robe with which the child was covered
after Baptism and Unction, and hence the child itself was called a
_Chrisome-child_, i.e.[7] In the 1549 Prayer Book, the Prayer at the Anointing in the
Baptismal Service ran: "Almighty God, Who hath regenerated thee by
water and the Holy Ghost, and hath given unto thee the remission of all
thy sins, He vouchsafe to anoint thee with the Unction of His Holy
Spirit, and bring thee to the inheritance of everlasting life.Jerome, writing in the second century, says of the Baptized,
that he "bore on his forehead the banner of the Cross".[10] It is a real loss to use the Service for the Public Baptism of
Infants as a private office, as is generally done now.The doctrinal
teaching; the naming of the child; the signing with the cross; the
response of, and the address to, the God-parents--all these would be
helpful reminders to a congregation, if the service sometimes came, as
the Rubric orders, after the second lesson, and might rekindle the
Baptismal and Confirmation fire once lighted, but so often allowed to
die down, or flicker out.[14] Not more, it is estimated, than two or three out of every eight
have been baptized.[15] I may take an _additional_ Christian name at my Confirmation, but
I cannot change the old one.[16] The present Town Clerk of London has kindly informed me that the
earliest example he has found dates from 1418, when the name of John
Carpenter, Town Clerk, the well-known executor of Whittington, is
appended to a document, the Christian name being omitted.Ambrose Lee of the Heralds' College
may interest some."... Surname, in the ordinary sense of the word,
the King has none.He--as was his grandmother, Queen Victoria, as well
as her husband, Prince Albert--is descended from Witikind, who was the
last of a long line of continental Saxon kings or rulers.Witikind was
defeated by Charlemagne, became a Christian, and was created Duke of
Saxony.He had a second son, who was Count of Wettin, but clear and
well-defined and authenticated genealogies do not exist from which may
be formulated any theory establishing, by right or custom, _any_
surname, in the ordinary accepted sense of the word, for the various
families who are descended in the male line from this Count of
Wettin....  And, by-the-by, it must not be forgotten that the earliest
Guelphs were merely princes whose baptismal name was Guelph, as the
baptismal name of our Hanoverian Kings was George."The Blessed Sacrament!--or, as the Prayer Book calls it, "The Holy
Sacrament".This title seems to sum up all the other titles by which
the chief service in the Church is known.For
instance:--

_The Liturgy_, from the Greek _Leitourgia_,[1] a public service._The Mass_, from the Latin _Missa_, dismissal--the word used in the
Latin Liturgy when the people are dismissed,[2] and afterwards applied
to the service itself from which they are dismissed._The Eucharist_, from the Greek _Eucharistia_, thanksgiving--the word
used in all the narratives {82} of Institution,[3] and, technically,
the third part of the Eucharistic Service._The Breaking of the Bread_, one of the earliest names for the
Sacrament (Acts ii._The Holy Sacrifice_, which Christ once offered, and is ever offering._The Lord's Supper_ (1 Cor.10), a name perhaps originally used
for the _Agape_, or love feast, which preceded the Eucharist, and then
given to the Eucharist itself.It is an old English name, used in the
story of St.Anselm's last days, where it is said: "He passed away as
morning was breaking on the Wednesday before _the day of our Lord's
Supper_"._The Holy Communion_ (1 Cor.16), in which our baptismal union with
Christ is consummated, and which forms a means of union between souls
in the Church Triumphant, at Rest, and on Earth.In it, Christ, God
and Man, is the bond of oneness.All these, and other aspects of the Sacrament, are comprehended and
gathered up in the name which marks its supremacy,--The Blessed
Sacrament.{83}

Consider: What it is;
          What it does;
          How it does it.It is the supernatural conjunction of matter and spirit, of Bread and
Wine and of the Holy Ghost.Here, as in Baptism, the "inward and
spiritual" expresses itself through the "outward and visible".This conjunction is not a
_physical_ conjunction, according to physical laws; nor is it a
spiritual conjunction, according to spiritual laws; it is a Sacramental
conjunction, according to Sacramental laws.As in Baptism, so in the
Blessed Sacrament: the "outward and visible" is, and remains, subject
to natural laws, and the inward and spiritual to spiritual laws; but
the Sacrament itself is under neither natural nor spiritual but
Sacramental laws.For a perfect Sacrament requires both matter and spirit.[4]  If either
is absent, the Sacrament is incomplete.Thus, the Council of Trent's definition of {84} _Transubstantiation_[5]
seems, as it stands, to spoil the very nature of a Sacrament.It is
the "change of the whole substance of the bread into the Body, of the
whole substance of the wine into the blood of Christ, _only the
appearance_ of bread and wine remaining".Again, the Lutheran doctrine of Consubstantiation destroys the nature
of the Sacrament.The Lutheran _Formula Concordiae_, e.g., teaches
that "_outside the use the Body of Christ is not present_".Thus it
limits the Presence to the reception, whether by good or bad.The _Figurative_ view of the Blessed Sacrament {85} destroys the nature
of a Sacrament, making the matter symbolize something which is not
there.It is safer to take the words of consecration as they stand,
corresponding as they do so literally with the words of Institution,
and simply to say: "This (bread: it is still bread) is My Body" (it is
far more than bread); "this (wine: it is still wine) is My Blood" (it
is far more than wine).Can we get beyond this, in terms and
definitions?Can we say more than that it is a "Sacrament"--The
Blessed Sacrament?And after all, do we wish to do so?Briefly, the Blessed Sacrament does two things; It pleads, and It
feeds.It is the pleading _of_ the one Sacrifice; It is the feeding
_on_ the one Sacrifice.These two aspects of the one Sacrament are suggested in the two names,
_Altar_ and _Table_.In Western
Liturgies, _Altar_ is the rule, and _Table_ the exception; in Eastern
Liturgies, _Table_ is the rule, and _Altar_ {86} the exception.Both
are, perhaps, embodied in the old name, _God's Board_, of Thomas
Aquinas.This, for over 300 years, was the common name for what St.Irenaeus
calls "the Abode of the Holy Body and Blood of Christ".Convocation,
in 1640, decreed: "It is, and may be called, an Altar in that sense in
which the Primitive Church called it an Altar, and in no other".This
sense referred to the offering of what the Liturgy of St.James calls
"the tremendous and unbloody Sacrifice," the Liturgy of St.Chrysostom
"the reasonable and unbloody Sacrifice,"[7] and the Ancient English
Liturgy "a pure offering, an holy offering, an undefiled offering, even
the holy Bread of eternal Life, and the Cup of everlasting Salvation ".The word Altar, then, tells of the pleading of the Sacrifice of Jesus
Christ.In the words of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to Leo
XIII: "We plead and represent before the Father the Sacrifice of the
Cross"; or in the words of Charles Wesley: "To God it is an {87} Altar
whereon men mystically present unto Him the same Sacrifice, as still
suing for mercy"; or, in the words of Isaac Barrow: "Our Lord hath
offered a well-pleasing Sacrifice for our sins, and doth, at God's
right hand, continually renew it by presenting it unto God, and
interceding with Him for the effect thereof".The Sacrifice does not, of course, consist in the re-slaying of the
Lamb, but in the offering of the Lamb as it had been slain.It is not
the repetition of the Atonement, but the representation of the
Atonement.[8]  We offer on the earthly Altar the same Sacrifice that is
being perpetually offered on the Heavenly Altar.There is only one
Altar, only one Sacrifice, one Eucharist--"one offering, single and
complete".All the combined earthly Altars are but one Altar--the
earthly or visible part of the Heavenly Altar on which He, both Priest
and Victim, offers Himself as the Lamb "as it had been slain".The
Heavenly Altar is, as it were, the centre, and all the earthly Altars
the circumference.We gaze at the Heavenly Altar through the Earthly
Altars.We plead what He pleads; we offer what He offers.{88}

  Thus the Church, with exultation,
  Till her Lord returns again,
  Shows His Death; His mediation
  Validates her worship then,
  Pleading the Divine Oblation
  Offered on the Cross for men.And we must remember that in this offering the whole Three Persons in
the Blessed Trinity are at work.We must not in our worship so
concentrate our attention upon the Second Person, as to exclude the
other Persons from our thoughts.Indeed, if one Person is more
prominent than another, it is God the Father.It is to God the Father
that the Sacrifice ascends; it is with Him that we plead on earth that
which God the Son is pleading in Heaven; it is God the Holy Ghost Who
makes our pleadings possible, Who turns the many Jewish Altars into the
one Christian Altar.The _Gloria in Excelsis_ bids us render worship
to all three Persons engaged in this single act.The second aspect under consideration is suggested by the word
_Table_--the "Holy Table," as St.Athanasius
call it; "the tremendous Table," or the "Mystic {89} Table," as St.Chrysostom calls it; "the Lord's Table," or "this Thy Table," as,
following the Easterns, our Prayer Book calls it.This term emphasizes the Feast-aspect, as "Altar" underlines the
Sacrificial aspect, of the Sacrament.In the "Lord's Supper" we feast
upon the Sacrifice which has already been offered upon the Altar."This Thy Table," tells of the Banquet of the Lamb.Thomas puts
it:--

  He gave Himself in either kind,
  His precious Flesh, His precious Blood:
  In Love's own fullness thus designed
  Of the whole man to be the Food.Doddridge puts it, in his Sacramental Ave:--

  Hail!Thrice happy he, who here partakes
    That Sacred Stream, that Heavenly Food.This is the Prayer-Book aspect, which deals with the "_Administration_
of the Lord's Supper"; which bids us "feed upon Him (not it) in our
hearts by faith," and not by sight; which speaks of the elements as
God's "creatures of Bread and Wine"; which prays, in language of awful
solemnity, that we may worthily "eat His Flesh {90} and drink His
Blood".This is the aspect which speaks of the "means whereby" Christ
communicates Himself to us, implants within us His character, His
virtues, His will;--makes us one with Him, and Himself one with us.By
Sacramental Communion, we "dwell in Him, and He in us"; and this, not
merely as a lovely sentiment, or by means of some beautiful meditation,
but by the real communion of Christ--present without us, and
communicated to us, through the ordained channels.Hence, in the Blessed Sacrament, Jesus is for ever counteracting within
us the effects of the Fall.If the first Adam ruined us through food,
the second Adam will reinstate us through food--and that food nothing
less than Himself.The Holy Ghost is the operative power, but
the operation is overshadowed as by the wings of the Dove.It is
enough for us to know what is done, without questioning as to how it is
done.It is enough for us to worship Him in what He does, without {91}
straining to know how He does it--being fully persuaded that, what He
has promised, He is able also to perform.[9]  Here, again, we are in
the region of faith, not sight; and reason tells us that faith must be
supreme in its own province.For us, it is enough to say with Queen
Elizabeth:--

  _He was the Word that spake it;_
  _He took the bread and break it;_
  _And what that Word did make it,_
  _I do believe and take it._[10]



[1] _Leitos_, public, _ergon_, work.[2] Either when the service is over, or when those not admissible to
Communion are dismissed.The "Masses" condemned in the thirty-first
Article involved the heresy that Christ was therein offered again by
the Mass Priest to buy souls out of Purgatory at so much per Mass."He took the cup, and eucharized," i.e.[4] _Accedit verium ad elementum, et fit Sacramentum_ (St.[5] This definition is really given up now by the best Roman Catholic
theologians.The theory on which Transubstantiation alone is based
(viz.that "substance" is something which exists apart from the
totality of the accidents whereby it is known to us), has now been
generally abandoned.Now, it is universally allowed that "substance is
only a collective name for the sum of all the qualities of matter,
size, colour, weight, taste, and so forth".But, as all these
qualities of bread and wine admittedly remain after consecration, the
substance of the bread and wine must remain too.The doctrine of Transubstantiation condemned in Article 22, was that of
a material Transubstantiation which taught (and was taught _ex
Cathedra_ by Pope Nicholas II) that Christ's Body was sensibly touched
and broken by the teeth.[6] "The Altar has respect unto the oblation, the Table to the
participation" (Bishop Cosin).[10] "These lines," says Malcolm MacColl in his book on "The
Reformation Settlement" (p.34), "have sometimes been attributed to
Donne; but the balance of evidence is in favour of their Elizabethan
authorship when the Queen was in confinement as Princess Elizabeth.They are not in the first edition of Donne, and were published for the
first time as his in 1634, thirteen years after his death."These are "those five" which the Article says are "commonly called
Sacraments":[1] Confirmation, Matrimony, Orders, Penance, Unction.They are called "Lesser" Sacraments to distinguish them from the two
pre-eminent or "Greater Sacraments," Baptism and the Supper of the
Lord.[2]  These, though they have not all a "like nature" with the
Greater Sacraments, are selected by the Church as meeting the main
needs of her children between Baptism and Burial.They may, for our purpose, be classified in three groups:--

(I) _The Sacrament of Completion_ (Confirmation, which completes the
Sacrament of Baptism).{93}

(II) The Sacraments of Perpetuation (Holy Matrimony, which perpetuates
the human race; and Holy Order, which perpetuates the Christian
Ministry).(III) The Sacraments of Recovery (Penance, which recovers the sick soul
together with the body; and Unction, which recovers the sick body
together with the soul).And, first, The Sacrament of Completion: Confirmation.[2] The Homily on the Sacraments calls them the "other
Sacraments"--i.e.in addition to Baptism and the Eucharist.The renewal of vows is the
final part of the _preparation_ for Confirmation.It is that part of
the preparation which takes place in public, as the previous
preparation has taken place in private.Before Confirmation, the
Baptismal vows are renewed "openly before the Church".Their renewal
is the last word of preparation.The Bishop, or Chief Shepherd,
assures himself by question, and answer, that the Candidate openly
responds to the preparation he has received in {95} private from the
Parish Priest, or under-Shepherd.Before the last revision of the
Prayer Book, the Bishop asked the Candidates in public many questions
from the Catechism before confirming them; now he only asks one--and
the "I do," by which the Candidate renews his Baptismal vows, is the
answer to that preparatory question.It is still quite a common idea, even among Church people, that
Confirmation is something which the Candidate does for himself, instead
of something which God does to him.This is often due to the
unfortunate use of the word "confirm"[1] in the Bishop's question.At
the time it was inserted, the word "confirm" meant "confess,"[2] and
referred, not to the Gift of Confirmation, but to the Candidate's
public Confession of faith, before receiving the Sacrament of
Confirmation.It had nothing whatever to do with Confirmation itself.We must not, then, confuse the preparation for Confirmation with the
Gift of Confirmation.The Sacrament itself is God's gift to the child
bestowed through the Bishop in accordance with the teaching given to
{96} the God-parents at the child's Baptism: "Ye are to take care that
this child be brought to the Bishop _to be_ confirmed _by him_".[3]

And this leads us to our second point: What Confirmation is.In the words of our Confirmation Service, it "increases and
multiplies"--i.e.strengthens or confirms Baptismal grace.It is the
ordained channel which conveys to the Baptized the "sevenfold" (i.e.complete) gift of the Holy Ghost, which was initially received in
Baptism.And this will help us to answer a question frequently asked: "If I have
been confirmed, but not Baptized, must I be Baptized?"Surely, Baptism
must _precede_ Confirmation.If {97} Confirmation increases the grace
given in Baptism, that grace must have been received before it can be
increased."And must I be 'confirmed again,' as it is said, after
Baptism?"If I had not been Baptized _before_ I presented
myself for Confirmation, I have not confirmed at all.My Baptism will
now allow me to "be presented to the Bishop once again to be confirmed
by him"--and this time in reality."Did I, then, receive no grace when
I was presented to the Bishop to be confirmed by him before?"Much
grace, surely, but not the special grace attached to the special
Sacrament of Confirmation, and guaranteed to the Confirmed.God's love overflows its channels; what
God gives, or withholds, outside those channels, it would be an
impertinence for us to say.Again, Confirmation is, in a secondary sense, a Sacrament of
Admittance.It admits the Baptized to Holy Communion."It is expedient," says the rubric after an adult Baptism,
"that every person thus Baptized should be confirmed by the Bishop so
soon after his Baptism as conveniently may be; that _so he may be
admitted to the Holy Communion_.""And {98} there shall none _be
admitted to Holy Communion_," adds the rubric after Confirmation,
"until such time as he be confirmed, or be ready and desirous to be
confirmed."For "Confirmation, or the laying on of hands," fully
admits the Baptized to that "Royal Priesthood" of the Laity,[4] of
which the specially ordained Priest is ordained to be the
representative.The Holy Sacrifice is the offering of the _whole_
Church, the universal Priesthood, not merely of the individual Priest
who is the offerer.Thus, the Confirmed can take their part in the
offering, and can assist at it, in union with the ordained Priest who
is actually celebrating.They can say their _Amen_ at the Eucharist,
or "giving of thanks," and give their responding assent to what he is
doing in their name, and on their behalf."If I am a Communicant, but have
not been confirmed, ought I to present myself for Confirmation?"First, it
legislates for the normal case, then for the abnormal.First it says:
"None shall be admitted to Holy Communion until such time as they have
been Confirmed".Then it deals with {99} exceptional cases, and adds,
"or be willing and desirous to be confirmed".Such exceptional cases
may, and do, occur; but even these may not be Communicated unless they
are both "ready" and "desirous" to be confirmed, as soon as
Confirmation can be received.So does the Church safeguard her
Sacraments, and her children."But would you," it is asked, "exclude a Dissenter from Communion,
however good and holy he may be, merely because he has not been
Confirmed?"He certainly would have very little respect for me if I
did not.If, for instance, he belonged to the Methodist Society, he
would assuredly not admit me to be a "Communicant" in that Society."No person," says his rule, "shall be suffered on any pretence to
partake of the Lord's Supper _unless he be a member of the Society_, or
receive a note of admission from the Superintendent, which note must be
renewed quarterly."And, again: "That the Table of the Lord should be
open to all comers, is surely a great discredit, and a serious peril to
any Church".[5]  And yet the Church, the Divine Society, established by
Jesus Christ Himself, is blamed, and called narrow and {100} bigoted,
if she asserts her own rule, and refuses to admit "all comers" to the
Altar.To give way on such a point would be to forfeit, and rightly to
forfeit, the respect of any law-abiding people, and would be--in many
cases, is--"a great discredit, and a serious peril" to the Church.We
have few enough rules as it is, and if those that we have are
meaningless, we may well be held up to derision.The Prayer Book makes
no provision whatever for those who are not Confirmed, and who, if able
to receive Confirmation, are neither "ready nor desirous to be
Confirmed".Confirmation is for the Baptized, and none other.The Prayer-Book
Title to the service is plain.It calls Confirmation the "laying on of
Hands upon _those that are baptized_," and, it adds, "are come to years
of discretion".First, then, Confirmation is for the Baptized, and never for the
unbaptized.Secondly, it is (as now administered[6]) for {101} "those who have come
to years of discretion," i.e.As we pray
in the Ember Collect that the Bishop may select "fit persons for the
Sacred Ministry" of the special Priesthood, and may "lay hands suddenly
on no man," so it is with Confirmation or the "laying on of hands" for
the Royal Priesthood.The Bishop must be assured by the Priest who
presents them (and who acts as his examining Chaplain), that they are
"fit persons" to be confirmed.And this fitness must be of two kinds: moral and intellectual.The candidate must "have come to years of discretion,"
i.e.he must "know to refuse the evil and choose the good".[7]  This
"age of discretion," or _competent age_, as the Catechism Rubric calls
it, is not a question of years, but of character.Our present Prayer
Book makes no allusion to any definite span of years whatever, and to
make the magic age of fifteen the minimum universal age for Candidates
is wholly illegal.At the Reformation, the English Church fixed seven
as the age for Confirmation, but our 1662 Prayer Book is more
primitive, and, taking a common-sense view, {102} leaves each case of
moral fitness to be decided on its own merits.The moral standard must
be an individual standard, and must be left, first, to the parent, who
presents the child to the Priest to be prepared; then, to the Priest
who prepares the child for Confirmation, and presents him to the
Bishop; and, lastly, to the Bishop, who must finally decide, upon the
combined testimony of the Priest and parent--and, if in doubt, upon his
own personal examination.The _intellectual_ standard is laid down in the Service for the "Public
Baptism of Infants": "So soon as he can say the Creed, the Lord's
Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, in the vulgar (i.e.his native)
tongue, and be further instructed, etc."Here, the words "can say"
obviously mean can say _intelligently_.The mere saying of the words
by rote is comparatively unimportant, though it has its use; but if
this were all, it would degrade the Candidate's intellectual status to
the capacities of a parrot.But, "as soon as" he can intelligently
comply with the Church's requirements, as soon as he has reached "a
competent age," any child may "be presented to the Bishop to be
confirmed by him".{103}

And, in the majority of cases, in these days, "the sooner, the better".It is, speaking generally, far safer to have the "child" prepared at
home--if it is a Christian home--and confirmed from home, than to risk
the preparation to the chance teaching of a Public School.With
splendid exceptions, School Confirmation is apt to get confused with
the school curriculum and school lessons.It is a sort of "extra
tuition," which, not infrequently, interferes with games or work,
without any compensating advantages in Church teaching.(IV) WHAT IS ESSENTIAL."The Laying on of Hands"--and nothing else.This act of ritual (so
familiar to the Early Church, from Christ's act in blessing little
children) was used by the Apostles,[8] and is still used by their
successors, the Bishops.It is the only act essential to a valid
Confirmation.Other, and suggestive, ceremonies have been in use in different ages,
and in different parts of the Church: but they are supplementary, not
essential.Thus, in the sub-apostolic age, ritual {104} acts expressed
very beautifully the early names for Confirmation, just as "the laying
on of Hands" still expresses the name which in the English Church
proclaims the essence of the Sacrament.For instance, Confirmation is called _The Anointing_,[9] and _The
Sealing_, and in some parts of the Church, the Priest dips his finger
in oil blessed by the Bishop, and signs or seals the child upon the
forehead with the sign of the Cross, thus symbolizing the meaning of
such names.But neither the sealing, nor the anointing, is necessary
for a valid Sacrament.Confirmation, then, "rightly and duly" administered, completes the
grace given to a child at the outset of its Christian career.It
admits the child to full membership and to full privileges in the
Christian Church.It is the ordained Channel by which the Bishop is
commissioned to convey and guarantee the special grace attached {105}
to, and only to, the Lesser Sacrament of Confirmation.[10]



[1] "Ratifying and _confirming_ the same in your own persons."[2] The word was "confess" in 1549.[3] The Greek Catechism of Plato, Metropolitan of Moscow, puts it very
clearly: "Through this holy Ordinance _the Holy Ghost descendeth upon
the person Baptized_, and confirmeth him in the grace which he received
in his Baptism according to the example of His descending upon the
disciples of Jesus Christ, and in imitation of the disciples
themselves, who after Baptism laid their hands upon the believers; by
which laying on of hands the Holy Ghost was conferred".[5] Minutes of Wesleyan Conference, 1889, p.[6] In the first ages, and, indeed, until the fifteenth century,
Confirmation followed immediately after Baptism, both in East and West,
as it still does in the East.[9] In an old seventh century Service, used in the Church of England
down to the Reformation, the Priest is directed: "Here he is to put the
Chrism (oil) on the forehead of the man, and say, 'Receive the sign of
the Holy Cross, by the Chrism of Salvation in Jesus Christ unto Eternal
Life.[10] The teaching of our Church of England, passing on the teaching of
the Church Universal, is very happily summed up in an ancient Homily of
the Church of England.It runs thus: "In Baptism the Christian was
born again spiritually, to live; in Confirmation he is made bold to
fight.There he received remission of sin; here he receiveth increase
of grace....  In Baptism he was chosen to be God's son; in Confirmation
God shall give him His Holy Spirit to... perfect him.In Baptism he
was called and chosen to be one of God's soldiers, and had his white
coat of innocency given him, and also his badge, which was the red
cross set upon his forehead...; in Confirmation he is encouraged to
fight, and to take the armour of God put upon him, which be able to
bear off the fiery darts of the devil."We have called Holy Matrimony the "_Sacrament of Perpetuation_," for it
is the ordained way in which the human race is to be perpetuated.Matrimony is the legal union between two persons,--a union which is
created by mutual consent: Holy Matrimony is that union sanctioned and
sanctified by the Church.There are three familiar names given to this union: Matrimony,
Marriage, Wedlock.Matrimony, derived from _mater_, a mother, tells of the woman's (i.e.wife-man's) "joy that a man is born into the world".Marriage, derived
from _maritus_, a husband (or house-dweller[1]), tells of the man's
place in the "hus" or house.Wedlock, derived from _weddian_, a
pledge, reminds both man and woman of the life-long pledge which each
has made "either to other".{107}

It is this Sacrament of Matrimony, Marriage, or Wedlock, that we are
now to consider.We will think of it under four headings:--

  (I) What is it for?Marriage is, as we have seen, God's method of propagating the human
race.It does this in two ways--by expansion, and by limitation.This
is seen in the New Testament ordinance, "one man for one woman".It
expands the race, but within due and disciplined limitations.Expansion, without limitation, would produce quantity without quality,
and would wreck the human race; limitation without expansion might
produce quality without quantity, but would extinguish the human race.Like every other gift of God, marriage is to be treated "soberly,
wisely, discretely," and, like every other gift, it must be used with a
due combination of freedom and restraint.Hence, among other reasons, the marriage union between one man and one
woman is {108} indissoluble.For marriage is not a mere union of
sentiment; it is not a mere terminable contract between two persons,
who have agreed to live together as long as they suit each other.It
is an _organic_ not an emotional union; "They twain shall be one
flesh," which nothing but death can divide.No law in Church or State
can unmarry the legally married.A State may _declare_ the
non-existence of the marriage union, just as it may _declare_ the
non-existence of God: but such a declaration does not affect the fact,
either in one case or the other.In England the State does, in certain cases, declare that the life-long
union is a temporary contract, and does permit "this man" or "this
woman" to live with another man, or with another woman, and, if they
choose, even to exchange husbands or wives.This is allowed by the
Divorce Act of 1857,[2] "when," writes Bishop Stubbs, "the calamitous
legislation of 1857 inflicted on English Society and English morals
{109} the most cruel blow that any conjunction of unrighteous influence
could possibly have contrived".[3]

The Church has made no such declaration.It rigidly forbids a husband
or wife to marry again during the lifetime of either party.The Law of
the Church remains the Law of the Church, overridden--but not repealed.This has led to a conflict between Church and State in a country where
they are, in theory though not in fact, united.But this is the fault
of the State, not of the Church.It is a case in which a junior
partner has acted without the consent of, or rather in direct
opposition to, the senior partner.Historically and chronologically
speaking, the Church (the senior partner) took the State (the junior
partner) into partnership, and the State, in spite of all the benefits
it has received from the Church, has taken all it could get, and has
thrown the Church over to legalize sin.It has ignored its senior
partner, and loosened the old historical bond between the two.This
the Church cannot help, and this the State fully admits, legally
absolving the Church from taking any part in its mock re-marriages.{110}

(II) WHAT IS ITS ESSENCE?The essence of matrimony is "mutual consent".The essential part of
the Sacrament consists in the words: "I, M., take thee, N.," etc.Nothing else is essential, though much else is desirable.Thus,
marriage in a church, however historical and desirable, is not
_essential_ to the validity of a marriage.Marriage at a Registry
Office (i.e.mutual consent in the presence of the Registrar) is every
bit as legally indissoluble as marriage in a church.The not uncommon
argument: "I was only married in a Registry Office, and can therefore
take advantage of the Divorce Act," is fallacious _ab initio_.[4]

Why, then, be married in, and by the Church?Apart from the history
and sentiment, for this reason.The Church is the ordained channel
through which grace to keep the marriage vow is bestowed.A special
and _guaranteed_ grace is {111} attached to a marriage sanctioned and
blest by the Church.The Church, in the name of God, "consecrates
matrimony," and from the earliest times has given its sanction and
blessing to the mutual consent.We are reminded of this in the
question: "Who _giveth_ this woman to be married to this man?"In
answer to the question, the Parent, or Guardian, presents the Bride to
the Priest (the Church's representative), who, in turn, presents her to
the Bridegroom, and blesses their union.In the Primitive Church,
notice of marriage had to be given to the Bishop of the Diocese, or his
representative,[5] in order that due inquiries might be made as to the
fitness of the persons, and the Church's sanction given or withheld.After this notice, a special service of _Betrothal_ (as well as the
actual marriage service) was solemnized.These two separate services are still marked off from each other in
(though both forming a part of) our present marriage service.The
first part of the service is held outside the chancel gates, and
corresponds to the old service of _Betrothal_.Here, too, the actual
ceremony of "mutual consent" now takes place--that part of {112} the
ceremony which would be equally valid in a Registry Office.Then
follows the second part of the service, in which the Church gives her
blessing upon the marriage.And because this part is, properly
speaking, part of the Eucharistic Office, the Bride and Bridegroom now
go to the Altar with the Priest, and there receive the Church's
Benediction, and--ideally--their first Communion after marriage.So
does the Church provide grace for her children that they may "perform
the vows they have made unto the King".The late hour for modern
weddings, and the consequent postponement[6] of Communion, has obscured
much of the meaning of the service; but a nine o'clock wedding, in
which the married couple receive the Holy Communion, followed by the
wedding breakfast, is, happily, becoming more common, and is restoring
to us one of the best of old English customs.It is easy enough to
slight old religious forms and ceremonies; but is anyone one atom
better, or happier for having neglected them?{113}

(III) WHOM IS IT FOR?Marriage is for three classes:--

(1) The unmarried--i.e.those who have never been married, or whose
marriage is (legally) dissolved by death.(2) The non-related--i.e.either by consanguinity (by blood), or
affinity (by marriage).But, is not this very
hard upon those whose marriage has been a mistake, and who have been
divorced by the State?And, above all, is it not very hard upon the
innocent party, who has been granted a divorce?It is very hard, so
hard, so terribly hard, that only those who have to deal personally,
and practically, with concrete cases, can guess how hard--hard enough
often on the guilty party, and harder still on the innocent."God
knows" it is hard, and will make it as easy as God Himself can make it,
if only self-surrender is placed before self-indulgence.We sometimes forget that legislation for
the individual may bear even harder {114} on the masses, than
legislation for the masses may bear upon the individual.And, after
all, this is not a question of "hard _versus_ easy," but of "right
_versus_ wrong".Moreover, as we are finding out, that which seems
easiest at the moment, often turns out hardest in the long run.It is
no longer contended that re-marriage after a State-divorce is that
universal Elysium which it has always been confidently assumed to be.There is, too, a positively absurd side to the present conflict between
Church and State.Some time ago, a young
girl married a man about whom she knew next to nothing, the man telling
her that marriage was only a temporary affair, and that, if it did not
answer, the State would divorce them.Wrong-doing
ensued, and a divorce was obtained.Then the girl entered into a
State-marriage with another man.A
divorce was again applied for, but this time was refused.Eventually,
the girl left her State-made husband, and ran away with her real
husband.In other words, she eloped with her own husband.But what is
her position to-day?In the eyes of the State, she is now living with
a man who is not {115} her husband.Her State-husband is still alive,
and can apply, at any moment, for an order for the restitution of
conjugal rights--however unlikely he is to get it.Further, if in the
future she has any children by her real husband (unless she has been
married again to him, after divorce from her State-husband) these
children will be illegitimate.This is the sort of muddle the Divorce
Act has got us into.One course, and only one course, is open to the
Church--to disentangle itself from all question of extending the powers
of the Act on grounds of inequality, or any other real (and sometimes
very real) or fancied hardship, and to consistently fight for the
repeal of the Act.This, it will be said, is _Utopian_.It
is the business of the Church to aim at the Utopian.Her whole history
shows that she is safest, as well as most successful, when aiming at
what the world derides.One question remains: Is not the present Divorce Law "one law for the
rich and another for the poor"?This is its sole
merit, if merit it can have.It does, at least, partially protect the
poor from sin-made-easy--a condition which money has bought for the
rich.If the State abrogated the Sixth {116} Commandment for the rich,
and made it lawful for a rich man to commit murder, it would at least
be no demerit if it refused to extend the permit to the poor.But, secondly, marriage is for the non-related--non-related, that is,
in two ways, by Consanguinity, and Affinity.(_a_) By _Consanguinity_.Consanguinity is of two kinds, lineal and
collateral._Lineal_ Consanguinity[7] is blood relationship "in a
_direct_ line," i.e._Collateral_
Consanguinity is blood relationship from a common ancestor, but not in
a direct line.The law of Consanguinity has not, at the present moment, been attacked,
and is still the law of the land.Affinity[8] is near relationship by marriage.It
is of three kinds: (1) _Direct_, i.e.between a husband and his wife's
blood relations, and between a wife and her husband's blood relations;
(2) _Secondary_, i.e.between a husband {117} and his wife's relations
by marriage; (3) _Collateral_, i.e.between a husband and the relations
of his wife's relations.In case of Affinity, the State has broken
faith with the Church without scruple, and the _Deceased Wife's Sister
Bill_[9] is the result.So has it

  brought confusion to the Table round.The question is sometimes asked, whether the State can alter the
Church's law without her consent.An affirmative answer would reduce
whatever union still remains between them to its lowest possible term,
and would place the Church in a position which no Nonconformist body
would tolerate for a day.The further question, as to whether the
State can order the Church to Communicate persons who have openly and
deliberately broken her laws, needs no discussion.No thinking person
seriously contends that it can.(3) _For the Full-Aged_.No boy under 14, and no girl under 12, can contract a legal marriage
either with, or without the consent of Parents or Guardians.No man
{118} or woman under 21 can do so against the consent of Parents or
Guardians.(IV) WHAT ARE ITS SAFEGUARDS?These are, mainly, two: _Banns_ and _Licences_--both intended to secure
the best safeguard of all, _publicity_.This publicity is secured,
first, by Banns.The word is the plural form of _Ban_, "a proclamation".The object of
this proclamation is to "ban" an improper marriage.In the case of marriage after Banns, in order to secure publicity:--

(1) Each party must reside[10] for twenty-one days in the parish where
the Banns are being published.(2) The marriage must be celebrated in one of the two parishes in which
the Banns have been published.{119}

(3) Seven days' previous notice of publication must be given to the
clergy by whom the Banns are to be published--though the clergy may
remit this length of notice if they choose.(4) The Banns must be published on three separate (though not
necessarily successive) Sundays.(5) Before the marriage, a certificate of publication must be presented
to the officiating clergyman, from the clergyman of the other parish in
which the Banns were published.(6) Banns only hold good for three months.After this period, they
must be again published three times before the marriage can take place.(7) Banns may be forbidden on four grounds: If either party is married
already; or is related by consanguinity or affinity; or is under age;
or is insane.(8) Banns published in false names invalidate a marriage, if both
parties are cognisant of the fact before the marriage takes place, i.e.if they wilfully intend to defeat the law, but not otherwise.There are two kinds of Marriage Licence, an Ordinary, or Common
Licence, and a Special Licence.{120}

An _Ordinary Licence_, costing about L2, is granted by the Bishop, or
Ordinary, in lieu of Banns, either through his Chancellor, or a
"Surrogate," i.e.In marriage by Licence, three points may
be noticed:--

(1) One (though only one) of the parties must reside in the parish
where the marriage is to be celebrated, for fifteen days previous to
the marriage.(2) One of the parties must apply for the Licence in person, not in
writing.(3) A licence only holds good for three months.A _Special Licence_, costing about L30, can only be obtained from the
Archbishop of Canterbury,[11] and is only granted after special and
minute inquiry.The points here to notice are:--

(1) Neither party need reside in the parish where the marriage is to be
solemnized.(2) The marriage may be celebrated in any Church, whether licensed or
unlicensed[12] for marriages.(3) It may be celebrated at any time of the day.It may be added that
if any clergyman {121} celebrates a marriage without either Banns or
Licence (or upon a Registrar's Certificate), he commits a felony, and
is liable to fourteen years' penal servitude.[13]

Other safeguards there are, such as:--

_The Time for Marriages_.--Marriages must not be celebrated before 8
A.M., or after 3 P.M., so as to provide a reasonable chance of
publicity._The Witnesses to a Marriage_.--Two witnesses, at least, must be
present, in addition to the officiating clergyman._The Marriage Registers_.--The officiating clergyman must enter the
marriage in two Registers provided by the State._The Signing of the Registers_.--The bride and bridegroom must sign
their names in the said Registers immediately after the ceremony, as
well as the two witnesses and the officiating clergyman.If either
party wilfully makes any false statement with regard to age, condition,
etc., he or she is guilty of perjury.Such are some of the wise safeguards provided by both Church and State
for the Sacrament of Marriage.Their object is to prevent the {122}
marriage state being entered into "lightly, unadvisedly, or wantonly,"
to secure such publicity as will prevent clandestine marriages,[14] and
will give parents, and others with legal status, an opportunity to
lodge legal objections.Great is the solemnity of the Sacrament in which is "signified and
represented the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and His Church".[1] Husband--from _hus_, a house, and _buan_, to dwell.[2] Until fifty-three years ago an Act of Parliament was necessary for
a divorce.In 1857 _The Matrimonial Causes Act_ established the
Divorce Court.In 1873 the _Indicature Act_ transferred it to a
division of the High Court--the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty
Division.[3] "Visitation Charges," p.[4] It is a common legal error that seven years effective separation
between husband and wife entitles either to remarry, and hundreds of
women who have lost sight of their husbands for seven years innocently
commit bigamy.Probably the mistake comes from the fact that
_prosecution_ for bigamy does not hold good in such a case.But this
does not legalize the bigamous marriage or legitimize the children.[5] The origin of Banns.[6] The Rubric says: "It is convenient that the new-married persons
receive the Holy Communion _at the time of their marriage_, or at the
first opportunity after their marriage," thus retaining, though
releasing, the old rule.[7] Consanguinity--from _cum_, together, and _sanguineus_, relating to
blood.[8] Affinity--from _ad_, near, and _finis_, a boundary.[9] See a most helpful paper read by Father Puller at the E.C.U.Anniversary Meeting, and reported in "The Church Times" of 17 June,
1910.[10] There seems to be no legal definition of the word "reside".The
law would probably require more than leaving a bag in a room, hired for
twenty-one days, as is often done.It must be remembered that the
object of the law is _publicity_--that is, the avoidance of a
clandestine marriage, which marriage at a Registry Office now
frequently makes so fatally easy.[12] Such as, for example, Royal Chapels, St.Paul's Cathedral, Eton
College Chapel, etc.[14] It will be remembered that runaway marriages were, in former days,
frequently celebrated at Gretna Green, a Scotch village in
Dumfriesshire, near the English border.{123}

CHAPTER X.

HOLY ORDER.The Second Sacrament of Perpetuation is Holy Order.As the Sacrament
of Marriage perpetuates the human race, so the Sacrament of Order
perpetuates the Priesthood.Holy Order, indeed, perpetuates the
Sacraments themselves.It is the ordained channel through which the
Sacramental life of the Church is continued.Holy Order, then, was instituted for the perpetuation of those
Sacraments which depend upon Apostolic Succession.It makes it
possible for the Christian laity to be Confirmed, Communicated,
Absolved.Thus, the Christian Ministry is a great deal more than a
body of men, chosen as officers might be chosen in the army or navy.It is the Church's media for the administration of the Sacraments of
Salvation.To say this does not assert that God cannot, and does not,
save and sanctify souls in any other way; but it does assert, as
Scripture does, that the {124} Christian Ministry is the authorized and
ordained way.In this Ministry, there are three orders, or degrees: Bishops, Priests,
and Deacons.In the words of the Prayer Book: "It is evident unto all
men, diligently reading Holy Scripture and ancient Authors, that, from
the Apostles' time, there have been these Orders of Ministers in
Christ's Church; Bishops, Priests, and Deacons".[1]



(I) BISHOPS.Jesus Christ, "the Shepherd and Bishop of
our souls".When, and where, was the first Ordination?In the Upper
Chamber, when He, the Universal Bishop, Himself ordained the first
Apostles.When was {125} the second Ordination?When these Apostles
ordained Matthias to succeed Judas.This was the first link in the
chain of Apostolic Succession.In apostolic days,
Timothy was ordained, with episcopal jurisdiction over Ephesus; Titus,
over Crete; Polycarp (the friend of St.John), over Smyrna; and then,
later on, Linus, over Rome.And so the great College of Bishops
expands until, in the second century, we read in a well-known writer,
St.Irenaeus: "We can reckon up lists of Bishops ordained in the
Churches from the Apostles to our time".Link after link, the chain of
succession lengthens "throughout all the world," until it reaches the
Early British Church, and then, in 597, the English Church, through the
consecration of Augustine,[2] first Archbishop of Canterbury, and in
1903 of Randall Davidson his ninety-fourth successor.And this is the history of every ordination in the Church to-day."It
is through the Apostolic Succession," said the late Bishop Stubbs to
his ordination Candidates, "that I am empowered, through the long line
of mission and Commission {126} from the Upper Chamber at Jerusalem, to
lay my hands upon you and send you."[3]

How does a Priest become a Bishop?In the Church of England he goes
through four stages:--

  (1) He is _nominated_ by the Crown.(2) He is _elected_ by the Church.(3) His election is _confirmed_ by the Archbishop.(4) He is _consecrated_ by the Episcopate.(1) He is _nominated_ by the Crown.This is in accordance with the
immemorial custom of this realm.In these days, the Prime Minister
(representing the people) proposes the name of a Priest to the King,
who accepts or rejects the recommendation.If he accepts it, the King
nominates the selected Priest to the Church for election, and
authorizes the issue of legal documents for such election.This is
called _Conge d'elire_, "leave to elect".(2) He is _elected_ by the Church.The King's {127} nominee now comes
before the Dean and Chapter (representing the Church), and the Church
either elects or rejects him.If the
nominee is elected, what is called his "Confirmation" follows--that
is:--

(3) His election is _confirmed_ by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
according to a right reserved to him by _Magna Charta_.Before
confirming the election, the Archbishop, or his representative, sits in
public, generally at Bow Church, Cheapside, to hear legal objections
from qualified laity against the election.Objections were of late, it
will be remembered, made, and overruled, in the cases of Dr.Then, if duly nominated, elected, and confirmed,--

(4) He is _consecrated_ by the Episcopate.To safeguard the
Succession, three Bishops, at least, are required for the Consecration
of another Bishop, though one would secure a valid Consecration.No
Priest can be Consecrated Bishop under the age of thirty.Very
carefully does the Church safeguard admission to the Episcopate.{128}

_Homage._

After Consecration, the Bishop "does homage,"[4] i.e.he says that he,
like any other subject (ecclesiastic or layman), is the King's
"_homo_".He does homage, not for any
spiritual gift, but for "all the possessions, and profette spirituall
and temporall belongyng to the said...[5]  The
_temporal_ possessions include such things as his house, revenue, etc.But what is meant by doing homage for _spiritual_ possessions?Does
not this admit the claim that the King can, as Queen Elizabeth is
reported to have said, make or unmake a Bishop?Spiritual
_possessions_ do not here mean spiritual _powers_,--powers which can be
conferred by the Episcopate alone.{129} The "spiritual possessions"
for which a Bishop "does homage" refer to fees connected with spiritual
things, such as Episcopal Licences, Institutions to Benefices, Trials
in the Ecclesiastical Court, Visitations--fees, by the way, which, with
very rare exceptions, do not go into the Bishop's own pocket!_Jurisdiction._

What is meant by Episcopal Jurisdiction?Jurisdiction is of two kinds,
_Habitual_ and _Actual_.Habitual Jurisdiction is the Jurisdiction given to a Bishop to exercise
his office in the Church at large.It is conveyed with Consecration,
and is given to the Bishop as a Bishop of the Catholic Church.Thus an
Episcopal act, duly performed, would be valid, however irregular,
outside the Bishop's own Diocese, and in any part of the Church._Actual Jurisdiction_ is this universal Jurisdiction limited to a
particular area, called a Diocese.To this area, a Bishop's right to
exercise his Habitual Jurisdiction is, for purposes of order and
business, confined.The next order in the Ministry is the Priesthood.{130}

(II) PRIESTS.No one can read the Prayer-Book Office for the _Ordering of Priests_
without being struck by its contrast to the ordinary conception of
Priesthood by the average Englishman.The Bishop's words in the
Ordination Service: "Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of
a Priest in the Church of God," must surely mean more than that a
Priest should try to be a good organizer, a good financier, a good
preacher, or good at games--though the better he is at all these, the
better it may be.But the gift of the Holy Ghost for "the Office and
Work of a Priest" must mean more than this.We may consider it in connexion with four familiar English clerical
titles: _Priest, Minister, Parson, Clergyman_._Priest._

According to the Prayer Book, a Priest, or Presbyter, is ordained to do
three things, which he, and he alone, can do: to Absolve, to
Consecrate, to Bless.He, and he alone, can _Absolve_.It is the day of his
Ordination to the Priesthood.He is saying Matins as a Deacon just
_before_ his {131} Ordination, and he is forbidden to pronounce the
Absolution: he is saying Evensong just _after_ his Ordination, and he
is ordered to pronounce the Absolution.He, and he alone, can _Consecrate_.If a Deacon pretends to Consecrate
the Elements at the Blessed Sacrament, not only is his act sacrilege
and invalid, but even by the law of the land he is liable to a penalty
of L100.[6]

He, and he alone, can give the _Blessing_--i.e.The right of Benediction belongs to him as part of his
Ministerial Office.The Blessing pronounced by a Deacon might be the
personal blessing of a good and holy man, just as the blessing of a
layman--a father blessing his child--might be of value as such.In
each case it would be a personal act.But a Priest does not bless in
his own name, but in the name of the Whole Church.It is an official,
not a personal act: he conveys, not his own, but the Church's blessing
to the people.Hence, the valid Ordination of a Priest is of essential importance to
the laity.{132}

But there is another aspect of "the Office and Work of a Priest in the
Church of God".This we see in the word



_Minister._

The Priest not only ministers before God on behalf of his people, but
he ministers to his people on behalf of God.In this aspect of the
Priesthood, he ministers God's gifts to the laity.If, as a Priest, he
pleads the One Sacrifice on behalf of the people, as a Minister he
feeds the people upon the one Sacrifice.His chief ministerial duty is
to minister to the people--to give them Baptism, Absolution, Holy
Communion; to minister to all their spiritual needs whenever, and
wherever, he is needed.It is, surely, a sad necessity that this ministerial "office and work"
should be so often confused with finance, doles, charities, begging
sermons, committees, etc.In all such things he is, indeed, truly
serving and ministering; but he is often obliged to place them in the
wrong order of importance, and so dim the sight of the laity to his
real position, and not infrequently make his spiritual ministrations
unacceptable.A well-known and London-wide respected Priest said {133}
shortly before he died, that he had almost scattered his congregation
by the constant "begging sermons" which he hated, but which necessity
made imperative.The laity are claiming (and rightly claiming) the
privilege of being Church workers, and are preaching (and rightly
preaching) that "the Clergy are not the Church".If only they would
practise what they preach, and relieve the Clergy of all Church
finance, they need never listen to another "begging sermon" again.So
doing, they would rejoice the heart of the Clergy, and fulfil one of
their true functions as laity.This is one of the most beautiful of all the clerical names, only it
has become smirched by common use.The word Parson is derived from _Persona_, a _person_.The Parson is
_the_ Person--the Person who represents God in the Parish.It is not
his own person, or position, that he stands for, but the position and
Person of his Master.Paul, he can say, "I magnify mine
office," and probably the best way to magnify his office will be to
minimize himself.The outward marks of {134} respect still shown to
"the Parson" in some places, are not necessarily shown to the person
himself (though often, thank God, they may be), but are meant, however
unconsciously, to honour the Person he represents--just as the lifting
of the hat to a woman is not, of necessity, a mark of respect to the
individual woman, but a tribute to the Womanhood she represents.The Parson, then, is, or should be, the official person, the standing
element in the parish, who reminds men of God._Clergyman._

The word is derived from the Greek _kleros_,[7] "a lot," and conveys
its own meaning.According to some, it takes us back in thought to the
first Apostolic Ordination, when "they cast _lots_, and the _lot_ fell
upon Matthias".It reminds us that, as Matthias "was numbered with the
eleven," so a "Clergyman" is, at his Ordination, numbered with that
long list of "Clergy" who trace their spiritual pedigree to Apostolic
days.{135}

_Ordination Safeguards._

"Seeing then," run the words of the Ordination Service, "into how high
a dignity, and how weighty an Office and Charge" a Priest is called,
certain safeguards surround his Ordination, both for his own sake, and
for the sake of his people._Age._

No Deacon can, save under very exceptional circumstances, be ordained
Priest before he is 24, and has served at least a year in the Diaconate._Fitness._

This fitness, as in Confirmation, will be intellectual and moral.His
_intellectual_ fitness is tested by the Bishop's Examining Chaplain
some time before the Ordination to the Priesthood, and, in doubtful
cases, by the Bishop himself.His _moral_ fitness is tested by the Publication during Service, in the
Church where he is Deacon, of his intention to offer himself as a
Candidate for the Priesthood.To certify that this has been done, this
Publication must be signed by the Churchwarden, representing the {136}
laity, and by the Incumbent, representing the Clergy and responsible to
the Bishop.Further safeguard is secured by letters of Testimony from three
Beneficed Clergy, who have known the Candidate well either for the past
three years, or during the term of his Diaconate.Finally, at the very last moment, in the Ordination Service itself, the
Bishop invites the laity, if they know "any impediment or notable
crime" disqualifying the Candidate from being ordained Priest, to "come
forth in the Name of God, and show what the crime or impediment is".For many obvious reasons, but specially for
one._The Indelibility of Orders._

Once a Priest, always a Priest.When once the Bishop has ordained a
Deacon to the Priesthood, there is no going back.The law,
ecclesiastical or civil, may deprive him of the right to _exercise_ his
Office, but no power can deprive him of the Office itself.For instance, to safeguard the Church, and for {137} the sake of the
laity, a Priest may, for various offences, be what is commonly called
"unfrocked".He may be degraded, temporarily suspended, or permanently
forbidden to _officiate_ in any part of the Church; but he does not
cease to be a Priest.Any Priestly act, rightly and duly performed,
would be valid, though irregular.It would be for the people's good,
though it would be to his own hurt.Again: by _The Clerical Disabilities Act_ of 1870, a Priest may, by the
law of the land, execute a "Deed of Relinquishment," and, as far as the
law is concerned, return to lay life.This would enable him legally to
undertake lay work which the law forbids to the Clergy.[8]

He may, in consequence, regain his legal rights as a layman, and lose
his legal rights as a Priest; but he does not cease to be a Priest.The law can only touch his civil status, and cannot touch his priestly
"character".Hence, no securities can be superfluous to safeguard the irrevocable.{138}

_Jurisdiction._

As in the case of the Bishops, a Priest's jurisdiction is
twofold--_habitual_ and _actual_.Ordination confers on him _habitual_
jurisdiction, i.e.the power to exercise his office, to Absolve, to
Consecrate, to Bless, in the "Holy Church throughout the world".And,
as in the case of Bishops, for purposes of ecclesiastical order and
discipline, this Habitual Jurisdiction is limited to the sphere in
which the Bishop licenses him."Take thou authority," says the Bishop,
"to preach the word of God, and to minister the Sacraments _in the
congregation where thou shalt be lawfully appointed thereunto_."This
is called _Actual_ Jurisdiction._The Essence of the Sacrament._

The absolutely essential part of Ordination is the Laying on of Hands
(1 Tim.Various other and beautiful
ceremonies have, at different times, and in different places,
accompanied the essential Rite.Sometimes, and in some parts of the
Church, Unction, or anointing the Candidate with oil, has been used:
sometimes Ordination has been accompanied with the delivery of a Ring,
the Paten {139} and Chalice, the Bible, or the Gospels, the Pastoral
Staff (to a Bishop),--all edifying ceremonies, but not essentials.The word comes from the Greek _diakonos_, a
servant, and exactly describes the Office.Originally, a permanent
Order in the Church, the Diaconate is now, in the Church of England,
generally regarded as a step to the Priesthood.But
it is as this step, or preparatory stage, that we have to consider it.Considering the importance of this first step in the Ministry, both to
the man himself, and to the people, it is well that the laity should
know what safeguards are taken by the Bishop to secure "fit persons to
serve in the sacred ministry of the Church"[9]--and should realize
their own great responsibility in the matter.(1) _The Age._

No layman can be made a Deacon under 23.{140}

(2) The Preliminaries.The chief preliminary is the selection of the Candidate.The burden of
selection is shared by the Bishop, Clergy and Laity.The Bishop must,
of course, be the final judge of the Candidate's fitness, but _the
evidence upon which he bases his judgment_ must very largely be
supplied by the Laity.We pray in the Ember Collect that he "may lay hands suddenly on no man,
but make choice of _fit persons_".It is well that the Laity should
remember that they share with the Bishop and Clergy in the
responsibility of choice.For this fitness will, as in the case of the Priest, be moral and
intellectual.It will be _moral_--and it is here that the responsibility of the laity
begins.For, in addition to private inquiries made by the Bishop, the
laity are publicly asked, in the church of the parish where the
Candidate resides, to bear testimony to the integrity of his character.This publication is called the _Si quis_, from the Latin of the first
two words of publication ("if any..."), and it is repeated by the
Bishop in open church in the Ordination Service.The {141} absence of
any legal objection by the laity is the testimony of the people to the
Candidate's fitness.This throws upon the laity a full share of
responsibility in the choice of the Candidate.Their responsibility in
giving evidence is only second to that of the Bishop, whose decision
rests upon the evidence they give.Then, there is the testimony of the Clergy.No layman is accepted by
the Bishop for Ordination without _Letters Testimonial_--i.e.the
testimony of three beneficed Clergymen, to whom he is well known.These Clergy must certify that "we have had opportunity of observing
his conduct, and we do believe him, in our consciences, and as to his
moral conduct, a fit person to be admitted to the Sacred Ministry".Each signature must be countersigned by the signatory's own Bishop, who
thus guarantees the Clergyman's moral fitness to certify.Lastly, comes the Bishop himself, who, from first to last, is in close
touch with the Candidate, and who almost invariably helps to prepare
him personally in his own house during the week before his Ordination.In addition to University testimony,
evidence of the Candidate's {142} intellectual fitness is given to the
Bishop, as in the case of Priests, by his Examining Chaplains.Some
months before the Ordination, the Candidate is examined, and the
Examiner's Report sent in to the Bishop.The standard of intellectual
fitness has differed at various ages, in different parts of the Church,
and no one standard can be laid down.Assuming that the average
proportion of people in a parish will be (on a generous calculation) as
twelve Jurymen to one Judge, the layman called to the Diaconate should,
at least, be equal in intellectual attainment to "the layman" called to
the Bar.It does sometimes happen that evidence is given by Clergy, or laity,
which leads the Bishop to reject the Candidate on moral grounds.It
does sometimes happen that the Candidate is rejected or postponed on
intellectual grounds.It does, it must, sometimes happen that mistakes
are made: God alone is infallible.But, if due care is taken, publicly
and privately, and if the laity, as well as the Clergy, do their duty,
the Bishop's risk of a wrong judgment is reduced to a very small
minimum.A "fit" Clergy is so much the concern of the laity, that they may well
be reminded of their {143} parts and duties in the Ordination of a
Deacon.Liddon says, "the strength of the Church does not
consist in the number of pages in its 'Clerical Directory,' but in the
sum total of the moral and spiritual force which she has at her
command".[1] "The Threefold Ministry," writes Bishop Lightfoot, "can be traced
to Apostolic direction; and, short of an express statement, we can
possess no better assurance of a Divine appointment, or, at least, a
Divine Sanction."And he adds, speaking of his hearty desire for union
with the Dissenters, "we cannot surrender for any immediate advantages
the threefold Ministry which we have inherited from Apostolic times,
and which is the historic backbone of the Church" ("Ep.[2] The Welsh Bishops did not transmit Episcopacy to us, but rather
came into us.[3] In a book called _Registrum Sacrum Anglicanum_, Bishop Stubbs has
traced the name, date of Consecration, names of Consecrators, and in
most cases place of Consecration, of every Bishop in the Church of
England from the Consecration of Augustine.[4] The Bishops are one of the three Estates of the Realm--Lords
Spiritual, Lords Temporal, and Commons (not, as is so often said, King,
Lords, and Commons).The Archbishop of Canterbury is the first Peer of
the Realm, and has precedency immediately after the blood royal.The
Archbishop of York has precedency over all Dukes, not being of royal
blood, and over all the great officers of State, except the Lord
Chancellor.He has the privilege of crowning the Queen Consort."Encyclopedia of the Laws of England," vol.See Phillimore's "Ecclesiastical Law,"
vol.[7] But see Skeat, whose references are to [Greek: kleros], "a lot," in
late Greek, and the Clergy whose portion is the Lord (Deut.The [Greek: kleros] is thus the portion
rather than the circumstance by which it is obtained, i.e.[8] For example: farming more than a certain number of acres, or going
into Parliament.We deal now with the two last Sacraments under consideration--Penance
and Unction.Penance is for the
healing of the soul, and indirectly of the body: Unction is for the
healing of the body, and indirectly of the soul.Thomas Aquinas, "has been instituted to
produce one special effect, although it may produce, as consequences,
other effects besides."It is so with these two Sacraments.Body and
Soul are so involved, that what directly affects the one must
indirectly affect the other.Thus, the direct effect of Penance on the
soul must indirectly affect the body, and the direct effect of Unction
on the body must indirectly affect the soul.{145}

_Penance._

The word is derived from the Latin _penitentia_, penitence, and its
root-meaning (_poena_, punishment) suggests a punitive element in all
real repentance.It is used as a comprehensive term for confession of
sin, punishment for sin, and the Absolution, or Remission of Sins.As
Baptism was designed to recover the soul from original or inherited
sin, so Penance was designed to recover the soul from actual or wilful
sin....[1]  It is not, as in the case of infant Baptism, administered
wholly irrespective of free will: it must be freely sought ("if he
humbly and heartily desire it"[2]) before it can be freely bestowed.Thus, Confession must precede Absolution, and Penitence must precede
and accompany Confession._Confession._

Here we all start on common ground.the necessity of Confession (1) _to God_ ("If we confess our sins, He
is faithful and just to forgive us our sins") {146} and (2) _to man_
("Confess your faults one to another").Further, we all agree that
confession to man is in reality confession to God ("Against Thee, _Thee
only_, have I sinned").Our only ground of difference is, not
_whether_ we ought to confess, but _how_ we ought to confess.It is a
difference of method rather than of principle.There are two ways of confessing sins (whether to God, or to man), the
informal, and the formal.Most of us use one way; some the other; many
both._Informal Confession_.--Thank God, I can use this way at any, and at
every, moment of my life.If I have sinned, I need wait for no formal
act of Confession; but, as I am, and where I am, I can make my
Confession.Then, and there, I can claim the Divine response to the
soul's three-fold _Kyrie_: "Lord, have mercy upon me; Christ, have
mercy upon me; Lord, have mercy upon me".But do I never want--does
God never want--anything more than this?The soul is not always
satisfied with such an easy method of going to Confession.It needs at
times something more impressive, something perhaps less superficial,
less easy going.It demands more time for {147} deepening thought, and
greater knowledge of what it has done, before sin's deadly hurt cuts
deep enough to produce real repentance, and to prevent repetition.At
such times, it cries for something more formal, more solemn, than
instantaneous confession.It needs, what the Prayer Book calls, "a
special Confession of sins"._Formal Confession_.--Hence our Prayer Book provides two formal Acts of
Confession, and suggests a third.Two of these are for public use, the
third for private.In Matins and Evensong, and in the Eucharistic Office, a form of
"_general_ confession" is provided.Both forms are in the first person
plural throughout.Clearly, their primary intention is, not to make us
merely think of, or confess, our own personal sins, but the sins of the
Church,--and our own sins, as members of the Church.It is "we" have
sinned, rather than "I" have sinned.Such formal language might,
otherwise, at times be distressingly unreal,--when, e.g., not honestly
feeling that the "burden" of our own personal sin "is intolerable," or
when making a public Confession in church directly after a personal
Confession in private.In the Visitation of the Sick, the third mode of {148} formal
Confession is suggested, though the actual words are naturally left to
the individual penitent.The Prayer Book no longer speaks in the
plural, or of "a _general_ Confession," but it closes, as it were, with
the soul, and gets into private, personal touch with it: "Here shall
the sick man be moved to make a _special_ Confession of his sins, if he
feel his conscience troubled with any weighty matter; after which
Confession, the Priest shall absolve him (if he humbly and heartily
desire it) after this sort".This Confession is to be both free and
formal: formal, for it is to be made before the Priest in his
"_ministerial_" capacity; free, for the penitent is to be "moved" (not
"compelled") to confess.Notice, he _is_ to be moved; but then (though
not till then) he is free to accept, or reject, the preferred means of
grace.Sacraments are open to all;
they are forced on none.They are love-tokens of the Sacred Heart;
free-will offerings of His Royal Bounty.These, then, are the two methods of Confession at our disposal.God is
"the Father of an infinite Majesty".In _informal_ Confession, the
sinner goes to God as his _Father_,--as the Prodigal, after doing
penance in the far country, went {149} to his father with "_Father_, I
have sinned".In _formal_ Confession, the sinner goes to God as to the
Father of an _infinite Majesty_,--as David went to God through Nathan,
God's ambassador.Mary went back to the office.It is a fearful responsibility to hinder any soul from using either
method; it is a daring risk to say: "Because one method alone appeals
to me, therefore no other method shall be used by you".God multiplies
His methods, as He expands His love: and if any "David" is drawn to say
"I have sinned" before the appointed "Nathan," and, through prejudice
or ignorance, such an one is hindered from so laying his sins on Jesus,
God will require that soul at the hinderer's hands._Absolution._

It is the same with Absolution as with Confession.Here, too, we start
on common ground.All agree that "_God only_ can forgive sins," and
half our differences come because this is not recognized.Whatever
form Confession takes, the penitent exclaims: "_To Thee only it
appertaineth to forgive sins_".Pardon through the Precious Blood is
the one, and only, source of {150} forgiveness.Our only difference,
then, is as to God's _methods_ of forgiveness.Some seem to limit His love, to tie forgiveness down to one, and
only one, method of absolution--direct, personal, instantaneous,
without any ordained Channel such as Christ left.Direct, God's pardon
certainly is; personal and instantaneous, it certainly can be; without
any sacramental _media_, it certainly may be.But we dare not limit
what God has not limited; we dare not deny the existence of ordained
channels, because God can, and does, act without such channels.He has
opened an ordained fountain for sin and uncleanness as a superadded
gift of love, and in the Ministry of reconciliation He conveys pardon
through this channel.At the most solemn moment of his life, when a Deacon is ordained
Priest, the formal terms of his Commission to the Priesthood run thus:
"Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of a Priest in the
Church of God, now committed unto thee by the Imposition of our hands.Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins thou
dost retain, they are retained."No
Priest dare hide his commission, play with {151} the plain meaning of
the words, or conceal from others a "means of grace" which they have a
blessed right to know of, and to use.But what is the good of this Absolution, if God can forgive without it?There must, therefore, be some
superadded grace attached to this particular ordinance.It is not left merely to comfort the penitent (though that it
does), nor to let him hear from a fellow-sinner that his sins are
forgiven him (though that he does); but it is left, like any other
Sacrament, as a special means of grace.It is the ordained Channel
whereby God's pardon is conveyed to (and only to) the penitent sinner."No penitence, no pardon," is the law of Sacramental Absolution.The Prayer Book, therefore, preaches the power of formal, as well as
informal, Absolution.There are in it three forms of Absolution,
varying in words but the same in power.The appropriating power of the
penitent may, and does, vary, according to the sincerity of his
confession: Absolution is in each case the same.It is man's capacity
to receive it, not God's power in giving it, that varies.Thus, all
three Absolutions in the {152} Prayer Book are of the same force,
though our appropriating capacity in receiving them may differ.This
capacity will probably be less marked at Matins and Evensong than at
Holy Communion, and at Holy Communion than in private Confession,
because it will be less personal, less thorough.The words of
Absolution seem to suggest this.The first two forms are in the plural
("pardon and deliver _you_"), and are thrown, as it were, broadcast
over the Church: the third is special ("forgive _thee_ thine offences")
and is administered to the individual.But the formal act is the same
in each case; and to stroll late into church, as if the Absolution in
Matins and Evensong does not matter, may be to incur a very distinct
loss.When, and how often, formal "special Confession" is to be used, and
formal Absolution to be sought, is left to each soul to decide.The
two special occasions which the Church of England emphasizes (without
limiting) are before receiving the Holy Communion, and when sick.Before Communion, the Prayer Book counsels its use for any disquieted
conscience; and the {153} Rubric which directs intending Communicants
to send in their names to the Parish Priest the day before making their
Communion, still bears witness to its framers' intention--that known
sinners might not be communicated without first being brought to a
state of repentance.The sick, also, after being directed to make their wills,[3] and
arrange their temporal affairs, are further urged to examine their
spiritual state; to make a special confession; and to obtain the
special grace, in the special way provided for them.And, adds the
Rubric, "men should often be put in remembrance to take order for the
settling of their temporal estates, while they are in health"--and if
of the temporal, how much more of their spiritual estate._Direction._

But, say some, is not all this very weakening to the soul?They are,
probably, mixing up two things,--the Divine Sacrament of forgiveness
which (rightly used) must be strengthening, and the human appeal for
direction which (wrongly used) may be weakening.{154}

But "direction" is not necessarily part of Penance.The Prayer Book
lays great stress upon it, and calls it "ghostly counsel and advice,"
but it is neither Confession nor Absolution.It has its own place in
the Prayer Book;[4] but it has not, necessarily, anything whatever to
do with the administration of the Sacrament.Direction may, or may
not, be good for the soul.It largely depends upon the character of
the penitent, and the wisdom of the Director.It is quite possible for
the priest to over-direct, and it is fatally possible for the penitent
to think more of direction than of Absolution.It is quite possible to
obscure the Sacramental side of Penance with a human craving for
"ghostly counsel and advice".Satan would not be Satan if it were not
so.But this "ghostly," or spiritual, "counsel and advice" has saved
many a lad, and many a man, from many a fall; and when rightly sought,
and wisely given is, as the Prayer Book teaches, a most helpful adjunct
to Absolution.Only, it is not, necessarily, a part of "going to
Confession".{155}

_Indulgences._

The abuse of the Sacrament is another, and not unnatural objection to
its use; and it often gets mixed up with Mediaeval teaching about
Indulgences.An _Indulgence_ is exactly what the word suggests--the act of
indulging, or granting a favour.In Roman theology, an Indulgence is
the remission of temporal punishment due to sin after Absolution.It
is either "plenary," i.e.when the whole punishment is remitted, or
"partial," when some of it is remitted.At corrupt periods of Church
history, these Indulgences have been bought for money,[5] thus making
one law for the rich, and another for the poor.Very naturally, the
scandals connected with such buying and selling raised suspicions
against the Sacrament with which Indulgences were associated.[6]  But
Indulgences have nothing in the world to do with the right use of the
lesser Sacrament of Penance.{156}

_Amendment._

The promise of Amendment is an essential part of Penance.It is a
necessary element in all true contrition.Thus, the penitent promises
"true amendment" before he receives Absolution.If he allowed a priest
to give him Absolution without firmly purposing to amend, he would not
only invalidate the Absolution, but would commit an additional sin.The promise to amend may, like any other promise, be made and broken;
but the deliberate purpose must be there.No better description of true repentance can be found than in
Tennyson's "Guinevere":--

  _For what is true repentance but in thought--_
  _Not ev'n in inmost thought to think again_
  _The sins that made the past so pleasant to us._


Such has been the teaching of the Catholic Church always, everywhere,
and at all times: such is the teaching of the Church of England, as
part of that Church, and as authoritatively laid down in the Book of
Common Prayer.Absolution is the conveyance of God's
pardon to the penitent sinner by God's ordained Minister, through the
ordained Ministry of Reconciliation.{157}

  Lamb of God, the world's transgression
    Thou alone canst take away;
  Hear!hear our heart's confession,
    And Thy pardoning grace convey.Thine availing intercession
    We but echo when we pray.[2] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[3] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[4] See the First Exhortation in the Order of the Administration of the
Holy Communion.Peter's at Rome was largely built out of funds gained by the
sale of indulgences.[6] The Council of Trent orders that Indulgences must be granted by
Pope and Prelate _gratis_.The second Sacrament of Recovery is _Unction_, or, in more familiar
language, "the Anointing of the Sick".It is called by Origen "the
complement of Penance".The meaning of the Sacrament is found in St.let him call for the elders of the Church; and let them
pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the
prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up;
and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."Here the Bible states that the "Prayer of Faith" with Unction is more
effective than the "Prayer of Faith" without Unction.It can (1) recover the body, and (2) restore the
soul.Its primary {159} object seems to be to recover the body; but it
also, according to the teaching of St.First, he says, Anointing with the Prayer of Faith heals the body; and
then, because of the inseparable union between body and soul, it
cleanses the soul.Thus, as the object of Penance is primarily to heal the soul, and
indirectly to heal the body; so the object of Unction is primarily to
heal the body, and indirectly to heal the soul.The story of Unction may be summarized very shortly.It was instituted
in Apostolic days, when the Apostles "anointed with oil many that were
sick and healed them" (St.It was continued in the Early
Church, and perpetuated during the Middle Ages, when its use (by a
"_corrupt_[1] following of the Apostles") was practically limited to
the preparation of the dying instead of (by a _correct_ "following of
the Apostles") being used for the recovery of the living.In our 1549
Prayer Book an authorized Office was appointed for its use, but this,
lest it should be misused, was omitted in 1552.And although, as
Bishop Forbes says, "everything of that earlier Liturgy was praised by
those who {160} removed it," it has not yet been restored.It is "one
of the lost Pleiads" of our present Prayer Book.But, as Bishop Forbes
adds, "there is nothing to hinder the revival of the Apostolic and
Scriptural Custom of Anointing the Sick whenever any devout person
desires it".[2]



_Extreme Unction._

An unhistoric use of the name partly explains the unhistoric use of the
Sacrament._Extreme_, or last (_extrema_) Unction has been taken to
mean the anointing of the sick when _in extremis_.This, as we have
seen, is a "corrupt," and not a correct, "following of the Apostles".The phrase _Extreme_ Unction means the extreme, or last, of a series of
ritual Unctions, or anointings, once used in the Church.The first
Unction was in Holy Baptism, when the Baptized were anointed with Holy
Oil: then came the anointing in Confirmation: then in Ordination; and,
last of all, the anointing of the sick.Of this last anointing, it is
written: "All Christian men should account, and repute the said manner
of anointing among the other Sacraments, forasmuch as it is a visible
sign of an invisible grace".[3]

{161}

_Its Administration._

It must be administered under the Scriptural conditions laid down in
St.The first condition refers to:--

(1) _The Minister_.--The Minister is _the Church_, in her corporate
capacity.Scripture says to the sick: "Let him call for the Elders,"
or Presbyters, "of the Church".The word is in the plural; it is to be
the united act of the whole Church.And, further, there must be
nothing secret about it, as if it were either a charm, or something to
be ashamed of, or apologized for.It may have to be done in a private
house, but it is to be done by no private person.[4]  "Let him call for
the elders."(2) _The Manner_.--The Elders are to administer Sacrament not in their
own name (any more than the Priest gives Absolution in his own name),
but "in the Name of the Lord".(3) _The Method_.--The sick man is to be anointed (either on the
afflicted part, or in other ways), _with prayer_: "Let them pray over
him".{162}

(4) _The Matter_.--Oil--"anointing him with oil".As in Baptism,
sanctified water is the ordained matter by which "Jesus Christ
cleanseth us from all sin"; so in Unction, consecrated oil is the
ordained matter used by the Holy Ghost to cleanse us from all
sickness--bodily, and (adds St."And if he have
committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."For this latter purpose, there are two Scriptural requirements:
_Confession_ and _Intercession_.For it follows: "Confess your faults
one to another, and pray for one another that ye may be healed".Thus
it is with Unction as with other Sacraments; with the "last" as with
the first--special grace is attached to special means.The Bible says
that, under certain conditions, oil and prayer together will effect
more than either oil or prayer apart; that oil without prayer cannot,
and prayer without oil will not, win the special grace of healing
guaranteed to the use of oil and prayer together.In our days, the use of anointing with prayer is (in alliance with, and
in addition to, Medical Science) being more fully recognized."The
Prayer of Faith" is coming into its own, and is being placed once more
in proper position in the {163} sphere of healing; _anointing_ is being
more and more used "according to the Scriptures".Both are being used
together in a simple belief in revealed truth.It often happens that
"the elders of the Church" are sent for by the sick; a simple service
is used; the sick man is anointed; the united "Prayer of Faith" (it
_must_ be "of Faith") is offered; and, if it be good for his spiritual
health, the sick man is "made whole of whatsoever disease he had".God give us in this, as in every other Sacrament, a braver, quieter,
more loving faith in His promises.The need still exists: the grace is
still to be had._If our love were but more simple,_
    _We should take Him at His word;_
  _And our lives would be all sunshine_
    _In the sweetness of our Lord._

  Word of God, 31.cried Zoie, now thoroughly enamoured of the
idea."You can always get TONS of them at the Children's Home," answered Aggie
confidently."I can't endure babies," declared Zoie, "but I'd do ANYTHING to get
Alfred back.Aggie looked at her small friend with positive pity."You don't WANT one
TO-DAY," she explained.Zoie rolled her large eyes inquiringly."If you were to get one to-day," continued Aggie, "Alfred would know it
wasn't yours, wouldn't he?"A light of understanding began to show on Zoie's small features."There was none when he left this morning," added Aggie."That's true," acquiesced Zoie."You must wait awhile," counselled Aggie, "and then get a perfectly new
one."But Zoie had never been taught to wait."After a few months," she explained, "when Alfred's temper has had time
to cool, we'll get Jimmy to send him a wire that he has an heir."exclaimed Zoie, as though Aggie had suggested an
eternity."I've never been away from Alfred that long in all my life.""Well, of course," she said coldly, as she
rose to go, "if you can get Alfred back WITHOUT that----"

"But I can't!"cried Zoie, and she clung to her friend as to her last
remaining hope."Then," answered Aggie, somewhat mollified by Zoie's complete
submission.The President of the Children's Home
is a great friend of Jimmy's," she said proudly.It was at this point that Zoie made her first practical suggestion."Then we'll LET JIMMY GET IT," she declared."Of course," agreed Aggie enthusiastically, as though they would be
according the poor soul a rare privilege."Jimmy gives a hundred
dollars to the Home every Christmas,"--additional proof why he should be
selected for this very important office."If Alfred were to
give a hundred dollars to a Baby's Home, I should suspect him."In spite of her firm faith in
Jimmy's innocence, she was undoubtedly annoyed by Zoie's unpleasant
suggestion.There was an instant's pause, then putting disagreeable thoughts from
her mind, Aggie turned to Zoie with renewed enthusiasm."We must get down to business," she said, "we'll begin on the baby's
outfit at once."exclaimed Zoie, and she clapped her hands merrily like a
very small child.A moment later she stopped with sudden misgiving."But, Aggie," she said fearfully, "suppose Alfred shouldn't come back
after I've got the baby?"Oh, he's sure to come back!""He'll take the first train, home.""I believe he will," assented Zoie joyfully."Aggie," she cried impulsively, "you are a darling.And she clasped her arms so tightly around Aggie's
neck that her friend was in danger of being suffocated.Releasing herself Aggie continued with a ruffled collar and raised
vanity: "You can write him an insinuating letter now and then, just to
lead up to the good news gradually."Zoie tipped her small head to one side and studied her friend
thoughtfully."Do you know, Aggie," she said, with frank admiration, "I
believe you are a better liar than I am.""I'm NOT a liar," objected Aggie vehemently, "at least, not often," she
corrected."I've never lied to Jimmy in all my life.""And Jimmy has NEVER LIED TO ME.""Isn't that nice," sniffed Zoie and she pretended to be searching for
her pocket-handkerchief."But, Aggie----" protested Zoie, unwilling to be left alone."I'll run in again at tea time," promised Aggie."I don't mind the DAYS," whined Zoie, "but when NIGHT comes I just MUST
have somebody's arms around me."gasped Aggie, both shocked and alarmed."I can't help it," confessed Zoie; "the moment it gets dark I'm just
scared stiff.""That's no way for a MOTHER to talk," reproved Aggie.exclaimed Zoie, horrified at the sudden realisation that
this awful appellation would undoubtedly pursue her for the rest of
her life."Oh, don't call me that," she pleaded."You make me feel a
thousand years old.""Nonsense," laughed Aggie, and before Zoie could again detain her she
was out of the room.When the outside door had closed behind her friend, Zoie gazed about
the room disconsolately, but her depression was short-lived.Remembering
Aggie's permission about the letter, she ran quickly to the writing
table, curled her small self up on one foot, placed a brand new pen in
the holder, then drew a sheet of paper toward her and, with shoulders
hunched high and her face close to the paper after the manner of a
child, she began to pen the first of a series of veiled communications
that were ultimately to fill her young husband with amazement.CHAPTER XI

When Jimmy reached his office after his unforeseen call upon Zoie, his
subsequent encounter with Alfred, and his enforced luncheon at home
with Aggie, he found his mail, his 'phone calls, and his neglected
appointments in a state of hopeless congestion, and try as he would, he
could not concentrate upon their disentanglement.Growing more and more
furious with the long legged secretary who stood at the corner of his
desk, looking down upon him expectantly, and waiting for his tardy
instructions, Jimmy rose and looked out of the window.He could feel
Andrew's reproachful eyes following him."Shall Miss Perkins take your letters now?"asked Andrew, and he
wondered how late the office staff would be kept to-night to make up for
the time that was now being wasted.Coming after repeated wounds from his nearest and dearest, Andrew's
implied reproach was too much for Jimmy's overwrought nerves.And when Andrew could assure himself that
he had heard aright, he stalked out of the door with his head high in
the air.Jimmy looked after his departing secretary with positive hatred.It was
apparent to him that the whole world was against him.His family, friends, and business associates
had undoubtedly lost all respect for him.From this day forth he was
determined to show himself to be a man of strong mettle.Having made this important decision and having convinced himself that he
was about to start on a new life, Jimmy strode to the door of the office
and, without disturbing the injured Andrew, he called sharply to Miss
Perkins to come at once and take his letters.Again he tried in vain to concentrate upon the details of
the "cut-glass" industry.Invariably his mind would wander back to the
unexpected incidents of the morning.Stopping suddenly in the middle of
a letter to a competing firm, he began pacing hurriedly up and down the
room.Had she not feared that her chief might misconstrue any suggestion from
her as an act of impertinence, Miss Perkins, having learned all the
company's cut-glass quotations by rote, could easily have supplied the
remainder of the letter.As it was, she waited impatiently, tapping the
corner of the desk with her idle pencil.Jimmy turned at the sound, and
glanced at the pencil with unmistakable disapproval.After one or two more uneasy laps about the room, Jimmy went
to his 'phone and called his house number."It's undoubtedly domestic trouble," decided Miss Perkins, and she
wondered whether it would be delicate of her, under the circumstances,
to remain in the room.From her employer's conversation at the 'phone, it was clear to Miss
Perkins that Mrs.Jinks was spending the afternoon with Mrs Hardy,
but why this should have so annoyed MR.Jinks was a question that Miss
Perkins found it difficult to answer.Jinks's
present state of unrest could be traced to the door of the beautiful
young wife of his friend?"Oh dear," thought Miss Perkins, "how
scandalous!""That will do," commanded Jimmy, interrupting Miss Perkins's interesting
speculations, and he nodded toward the door."But----" stammered Miss Perkins, as she glanced at the unfinished
letters."I'll call you when I need you," answered Jimmy gruffly.Miss Perkins
left the room in high dudgeon."I'LL show them," said Jimmy to himself, determined to carry out his
recent resolve to be firm.Then his mind wend back to his domestic troubles."Suppose, that Zoie,
after imposing secrecy upon him, should change that thing called her
'mind' and confide in Aggie about the luncheon?"He decided to telephone to Zoie's house and find out how affairs
were progressing."If Aggie HAS found out
about the luncheon," he argued, "my 'phoning to Zoie's will increase her
suspicions.If Zoie has told her nothing, she'll wonder why I'm 'phoning
to Zoie's house.There's only one thing to do," he decided.I can tell from Aggie's face when I meet her at dinner
whether Zoie has betrayed me."Having arrived at this conclusion, Jimmy resolved to get home as early
as possible, and again Miss Perkins was called to his aid.The flurry with which Jimmy despatched the day's remaining business
confirmed both Miss Perkins and Andrew in their previous opinion that
"the boss" had suddenly "gone off his head."And when he at last left
the office and banged the door behind him there was a general sigh of
relief from his usually tranquil staff.Instead of walking, as was his custom, Jimmy took a taxi to his home but
alas, to his surprise he found no wife."None at all," answered that unperturbed creature; and Jimmy felt sure
that the attitude of his office antagonists had communicated itself to
his household servants.When Jimmy's anxious ear at last caught the rustle of a woman's dress in
the hallway, his dinner had been waiting half an hour, and he had
worked himself into a state of fierce antagonism toward everything and
everybody.At the sound of Aggie's voice however, his heart began to pound with
fear."Had she found him out for the weak miserable deceiver that he
was?Would she tell him that they were going to separate forever?""Awfully sorry to be so late,
dear," she said.Jimmy felt her kiss upon his chubby cheek and her dear arms about his
neck.He decided forthwith to tell her everything, and never, never
again to run the risk of deceiving her; but before he could open his
lips, she continued gaily:

"I've brought Zoie home with me, dear.There's no sense in her eating
all alone, and she's going to have ALL her dinners with us.""After dinner," continued Aggie, "you and I can take her to
the theatre and all those places and keep her cheered until Alfred comes
home."Was it possible that Alfred had already
relented?"Oh, he doesn't know it yet," explained Aggie, "but he's coming.We'll
tell you all about it at dinner."While waiting for Aggie, Jimmy had thought himself hungry, but once
the two women had laid before him their "nefarious baby-snatching
scheme"--food lost its savour for him, and one course after another was
taken away from him untouched.Each time that Jimmy ventured a mild objection to his part in the plan,
as scheduled by them, he met the threatening eye of Zoie; and by the
time that the three left the table he was so harassed and confused by
the chatter of the two excited women, that he was not only reconciled
but eager to enter into any scheme that might bring Alfred back, and
free him of the enforced companionship of Alfred's nerve-racking wife.True, he reflected, it was possible that Alfred, on his return, might
discover him to be the culprit who lunched with Zoie and might carry out
his murderous threat; but even such a fate was certainly preferable to
interminable evenings spent under the same roof with Zoie."All YOU need do, Jimmy," explained Aggie sweetly, when the three of
them were comfortably settled in the library, "is to see your friend
the Superintendent of the Babies' Home, and tell him just what kind of a
baby we shall need, and when we shall need it.""Oh yes, indeed," said Aggie confidently, and she turned to Jimmy with
a matter-of-fact tone."You'd better tell the Superintendent to have
several for us to look at when the time arrives.""Yes, that's better," agreed Zoie.As for Jimmy, he had long ceased to make any audible comment, but
internally he was saying to himself: "man of strong mettle, indeed!""We'll attend to all the clothes for the child," said Aggie generously
to Jimmy."I want everything to be hand-made," exclaimed Zoie enthusiastically."We can make a great many of the things ourselves, evenings," said
Aggie, "while we sit here and talk to Jimmy."Jimmy rolled his eyes toward her like a dumb beast of burden."MOST evenings," assented Aggie."And then toward the last, you know,
Zoie----" she hesitated to explain further, for Jimmy was already
becoming visibly embarrassed."Oh, yes, that's true," blushed Zoie.There was an awkward pause, then Aggie turned again toward Jimmy, who
was pretending to rebuild the fire."Oh yes, one more thing," she said."When everything is quite ready for Alfred's return, we'll allow you,
Jimmy dear, to wire him the good news.""I wish it were time to wire now," said Zoie pensively, and in his mind,
Jimmy fervently agreed with that sentiment."The next few months will slip by before you know it," declared Aggie
cheerfully."And by the way, Zoie," she added, "why should you go back
to your lonesome flat to-night?"Zoie began to feel for her pocket handkerchief--Jimmy sat up to receive
the next blow."Stay here with us," suggested Aggie."We'll be so glad
to have you."When the two girls went upstairs arm in arm that night, Jimmy remained
in his chair by the fire, too exhausted to even prepare for bed.This had certainly been the longest day of his life.CHAPTER XII

WHEN Aggie predicted that the few months of waiting would pass quickly
for Zoie, she was quite correct.They passed quickly for Aggie as well;
but how about Jimmy?When he afterward recalled this interval in his
life, it was always associated with long strands of lace winding around
the legs of the library chairs, white things lying about in all the
places where he had once enjoyed sitting or lying, late dinners, lonely
breakfasts, and a sense of isolation from Aggie.One evening when he had waited until he was out of all patience with
Aggie, he was told by his late and apologetical spouse that she had been
helping Zoie to redecorate her bedroom to fit the coming occasion."It is all done in pink and white," explained Aggie, and then followed
detailed accounts of the exquisite bed linens, the soft lovely hangings,
and even the entire relighting of the room.asked Jimmy, objecting to any scheme of Zoie's on general
principles."It's Alfred's favourite colour," explained Aggie."Besides, it's so
becoming," she added.Jimmy could not help feeling that this lure to Alfred's senses was
absolutely indecent, and he said so."Upon my word," answered Aggie, quite affronted, "you are getting as
unreasonable as Alfred himself."Then as Jimmy prepared to sulk, she
added coaxingly, "I was GOING to tell you about Zoie's lovely new
negligee, and about the dear little crib that just matches it."I can't think why you've taken such a dislike to that helpless child,"
said Aggie.A few days later, while in the midst of his morning's mail, Jimmy was
informed that it was now time for him to conduct Aggie and Zoie to the
Babies' Home to select the last, but most important, detail for
their coming campaign.According to instructions, Jimmy had been in
communication with the amused Superintendent of the Home, and he now led
the two women forth with the proud consciousness that he, at least, had
attended properly to his part of the business.By the time they reached
the Children's Home, several babies were on view for their critical
inspection.Zoie stared into the various cribs containing the wee, red mites with
puckered faces.she exclaimed, "haven't you any white ones?""These are supposed to be white," said the Superintendent, with an
indulgent smile, "the black ones are on the other side of the room."cried Zoie in horror, and she faced about quickly as
though expecting an attack from their direction."Which particular one of these would you recommend?"asked the practical
Aggie of the Superintendent as she surveyed the first lot."Well, it's largely a matter of taste, ma'am," he answered."This seems
a healthy little chap," he added, and seizing the long white clothes
of the nearest infant, he drew him across his arm and held him out for
Aggie's inspection."Let's see," cried Zoie, and she stood on tiptoe to peep over the
Superintendent's elbow.As for Jimmy, he stood gloomily apart.This was an ordeal for which
he had long been preparing himself, and he was resolved to accept it
philosophically."I don't think much of that one," snipped Zoie."It's not MY affair," answered Jimmy curtly.Aggie perceived trouble brewing, and she turned to pacify Jimmy."Which
one do you think your FRIEND ALFRED would like?""If I were in his place----" began Jimmy hotly."Oh, but you AREN'T," interrupted Zoie; then she turned to the
Superintendent."What makes some of them so much larger than others?"she asked, glancing at the babies he had CALLED "white.""Well, you see they're of different ages," explained the Superintendent
indulgently.Jinks they must all be of the same age," said Zoie with a
reproachful look at Jimmy."I should say a week old," said Aggie."Then this is the one for you," decided the Superintendent, designating
his first choice."I think we'd better take the Superintendent's advice," said Aggie
complacently.Zoie looked around the room with a dissatisfied air.Was it possible
that all babies were as homely as these?"You know, Zoie," explained Aggie, divining her thought, "they get
better looking as they grow older.""Fetch it home, Jimmy," said Aggie.exclaimed Jimmy, who had considered his mission completed."You don't expect US to carry it, do you?"The Superintendent settled the difficulty temporarily by informing them
that the baby could not possibly leave the home until the mother had
signed the necessary papers for its release."I thought all those details had been attended to," said Aggie, and
again the two women surveyed Jimmy with grieved disappointment."I'll get the mother's signature the first thing in the morning,"
volunteered the Superintendent."Very well," said Zoie, "and in the meantime, I'll send some new clothes
for it," and with a lofty farewell to the Superintendent, she and Aggie
followed Jimmy down stairs to the taxi."Now," said Zoie, when they were properly seated, "let's stop at a
telegraph office and let Jimmy send a wire to Alfred.""Wait until we get the baby," cautioned Aggie."We'll have it the first thing in the morning," argued Zoie."Jimmy can send him a night-letter," compromised Aggie, "that way Alfred
won't get the news until morning."A few minutes later, the taxi stopped in front of Jimmy's office and
with a sigh of thanksgiving he hurried upstairs to his unanswered mail.CHAPTER XIII

When Alfred Hardy found himself on the train bound for Detroit, he tried
to assure himself that he had done the right thing in breaking away
from an association that had kept him for months in a constant state of
ferment.Having settled this
point to his temporary satisfaction, he opened his afternoon paper
and leaned back in his seat, meaning to divert his mind from personal
matters, by learning what was going on in the world at large.No sooner had his eye scanned the first headline than he was startled by
a boisterous greeting from a fellow traveller, who was just passing down
the aisle."Detroit," answered Alfred, annoyed by the sudden interruption."THAT'S a funny thing," declared the convivial spirit, not guessing how
funny it really was."You know," he continued, so loud that everyone in
the vicinity could not fail to hear him, "the last time I met you two,
you were on your honeymoon--on THIS VERY TRAIN," and with that the
fellow sat himself down, uninvited, by Alfred's side and started on a
long list of compliments about "the fine little girl" who had in his
opinion done Alfred a great favour when she consented to tie herself to
a "dull, money-grubbing chap" like him."So," thought Alfred, "this is the way the world sees us."And he began
to frame inaudible but desperate defences of himself.Again he told
himself that he was right; but his friend's thoughtless words had
planted an uncomfortable doubt in his mind, and when he left the
train to drive to his hotel, he was thinking very little about the new
business relations upon which he was entering in Detroit, and very much
about the domestic relations which he had just severed in Chicago.Had he been merely a "dull money-grubber"?Had he left his wife too much
alone?Was she not a mere child when he married her?Could he not, with
more consideration, have made of her a more understanding companion?These were questions that were still unanswered in his mind when he
arrived at one of Detroit's most enterprising hotels.But later, having telephoned to his office and found that several
matters of importance were awaiting his decision, he forced himself to
enter immediately upon his business obligations.As might have been expected, Alfred soon won the respect and serious
consideration of most of his new business associates, and this in a
measure so mollified his hurt pride, that upon rare occasions he was
affable enough to accept the hospitality of their homes.But each
excursion that he made into the social life of these new friends, only
served to remind him of the unsettled state of his domestic affairs.his hostess would remark before they were
fairly seated at table."They tell me she is so pretty," his vis-a-vis would exclaim.Then his host would laugh and tell the "dear ladies" that in HIS
opinion, Alfred was afraid to bring his wife to Detroit, lest he might
lose her to a handsomer man.Alfred could never quite understand why remarks such as this annoyed him
almost to the point of declaring the whole truth.His LEAVING Zoie, and
his "losing" her, as these would-be comedians expressed it, were
two separate and distinct things in his mind, and he felt an almost
irresistible desire to make this plain to all concerned.But no sooner did he open his lips to do so, than a picture of Zoie in
all her child-like pleading loveliness, arose to dissuade him.He could
imagine his dinner companions all pretending to sympathise with him,
while they flayed poor Zoie alive.She would never have another chance
to be known as a respectable woman, and compared to most women of
his acquaintance, she WAS a respectable woman.True, according to
old-fashioned standards, she had been indiscreet, but apparently the
present day woman had a standard of her own.Alfred found his eye
wandering round the table surveying the wives of his friends.Was there
one of them, he wondered, who had never fibbed to her husband, or eaten
a simple luncheon unchaperoned by him?Of one thing he was certain,
there was not one of them so attractive as Zoie.Might she not be
forgiven, to some extent, if her physical charms had made her a source
of dangerous temptation to unprincipled scoundrels like the one with
whom she had no doubt lunched?Then, too, had she not offered at the
moment of his departure to tell him the "real truth"?Might this not
have been the one occasion upon which she would have done so?"She seemed
so sincere," he ruminated, "so truly penitent."Then again, how generous
it was of her to persist in writing to him with never an answer from
him to encourage her.If she cared for him so little as he had once
imagined, why should she wish to keep up even a presence of fondness?These were some of the thoughts that were going through Alfred's mind
just three months after his departure from Chicago, and all the while
his hostess was mentally dubbing him a "dull person."she said before he was down the front
steps."It's hard to believe, isn't it?"commented a third, and his host
apologised for the absent Alfred by saying that he was no doubt worried
about a particular business decision that had to be made the next
morning.But it was not the responsibility of this business decision that was
knotting Alfred's brow, as he walked hurriedly toward the hotel, where
he had told his office boy to leave the last mail.This had been
the longest interval that Zoie had ever let slip without writing.He
recalled that her last letters had hinted at a "slight indisposition."In fact, she had even mentioned "seeing the doctor"--"Good Heavens!"he
thought, "Suppose she were really ill?When Alfred reached his rooms, the boy had not yet arrived.He crossed
to the library table and took from the drawer all the letters thus far
received from Zoie."How could he have been
so stupid as not to have realised sooner that her illness--whatever it
was--had been gradually creeping upon her from the very first day of his
departure?"It contained no letter from Zoie and
Alfred went to bed with an uneasy mind.The next morning he was down at his office early, still no letter from
Zoie.Refusing his partner's invitation to lunch, Alfred sat alone in his
office, glad to be rid of intrusive eyes."He would write to Jimmy
Jinks," he decided, "and find out whether Zoie were in any immediate
danger."Not willing to await the return of his stenographer, or to acquaint her
with his personal affairs, Alfred drew pen and paper toward him and sat
helplessly before it.How could he inquire about Zoie without appearing
to invite a reconciliation with her?While he was trying to answer
this vexed question, a sharp knock came at the door.He turned to see a
uniformed messenger holding a telegram toward him.Intuitively he felt
that it contained some word about Zoie.His hand trembled so that he
could scarcely sign for the message before opening it.A moment later the messenger boy was startled out of his lethargy by a
succession of contradictory exclamations.cried Alfred incredulously as he gazed in ecstasy at the telegram.he shouted, excitedly, as he rose from his chair.he asked the astonished boy, and he began rummaging rapidly
through the drawers of his desk.And he thrust a bill into the small boy's
hand."Yes, sir," answered the boy and disappeared quickly, lest this madman
might reconsider his generosity.Alfred threw down the time table in despair."No train for Chicago until
night," he cried; but his mind was working fast.The next moment he was
at the telephone, asking for the Division Superintendent of the railway
line.When Alfred's partner returned from luncheon he found a curt note
informing him that Alfred had left on a special for Chicago and would
"write."CHAPTER XIV

During the evening of the same day that Alfred was enjoying such
pleasurable emotions, Zoie and Aggie were closeted in the pretty pink
and white bedroom that the latter had tried to describe to Jimmy.On
a rose-coloured couch in front of the fire sat Aggie threading ribbons
through various bits of soft white linen, and in front of her, at the
foot of a rose-draped bed, knelt Zoie.She was trying the effect of
a large pink bow against the lace flounce of an empty but inviting
bassinette.she called to Aggie, as she turned her head to one side
and surveyed the result of her experiment with a critical eye.Aggie shot a grudging glance at the bassinette."I wish you wouldn't
bother me every moment," she said."I'll never get all these things
finished."Apparently Zoie decided that the bow was properly placed, for she
applied herself to sewing it fast to the lining.In her excitement she
gave the thread a vicious pull."Oh, dear, oh dear, my thread is always
breaking!""Wouldn't YOU be excited," questioned Zoie'"if you were expecting a baby
and a husband in the morning?""I suppose I should," admitted Aggie.For a time the two friends sewed in silence, then Zoie looked up with
sudden anxiety."You're SURE Jimmy sent the wire?""I saw him write it," answered Aggie, "while I was in the office
to-day.""Oh, he won't GET it until to-morrow morning," said Aggie."I told you
that to-day."I wonder what he'll be doing when he gets it?"There was a
suspicion of a smile around her lips."What will he do AFTER he gets it?"Looking up at her friend in alarm, Zoie suddenly ceased sewing."You
don't mean he won't come?""Of course I don't," answered Aggie."He's only HUMAN if he is a
husband."There was a sceptical expression around Zoie's mouth, but she did not
pursue the subject."How do you suppose that red baby will ever look in
this pink basket?"And then with a regretful little sigh, she
declared that she wished she'd "used blue.""I didn't think the baby that we chose was so horribly red," said Aggie.cried Zoie, "it's magenta."she exclaimed in annoyance, and once more rethreaded her needle."I couldn't look at it," she continued with a disgusted little pucker of
her face."I wish they had let us take it this afternoon so I could have
got used to it before Alfred gets here.""Now don't be silly," scolded Aggie."You know very well that the
Superintendent can't let it leave the home until its mother signs the
papers.It will be here the first thing in the morning.You'll have all
day to get used to it before Alfred gets here.""ALL DAY," echoed Zoie, and the corners of her mouth began to droop."Won't Alfred be here before TO-MORROW NIGHT?"Aggie was becoming exasperated by Zoie's endless questions."I told
you," she explained wearily, "that the wire won't be delivered until
to-morrow morning, it will take Alfred eight hours to get here, and
there may not be a train just that minute.""Eight long hours," sighed Zoie dismally.And Aggie looked at her
reproachfully, forgetting that it is always the last hour that
is hardest to bear.Aggie was
meditating whether she should read her young friend a lecture on the
value of patience, when the telephone began to ring violently.Zoie looked up from her sewing with a frown."You answer it, will you,
Aggie?""Hello," called Aggie sweetly over the 'phone; then she added in
surprise, "Is this you, Jimmy dear?"Apparently it was; and as Zoie
watched Aggie's face, with its increasing distress she surmised that
Jimmy's message was anything but "dear."cried Aggie over the telephone, "that's awful!"was the first question that burst from Zoie's
lips.Aggie motioned to Zoie to be quiet.echoed Zoie joyfully; and without waiting for more details
and with no thought beyond the moment, she flew to her dressing table
and began arranging her hair, powdering her face, perfuming her lips,
and making herself particularly alluring for the prodigal husband's
return.Now the far-sighted Aggie was experiencing less pleasant sensations at
the phone.Then she asked irritably, "Well,
didn't you mark it 'NIGHT message'?"From the expression on Aggie's face
it was evident that he had not done so."But, Jimmy," protested Aggie,
"this is dreadful!Then calling to him to wait a
minute, and leaving the receiver dangling, she crossed the room to
Zoie, who was now thoroughly engrossed in the making of a fresh toilet.she exclaimed excitedly, "Jimmy made a mistake.""Of course he'd do THAT," answered Zoie carelessly."But you don't understand," persisted Aggie."They sent the 'NIGHT
message' TO-DAY.cried Zoie, and the next instant she was
waltzing gaily about the room."That's all very well," answered Aggie, as she followed Zoie with
anxious eyes, "but WHERE'S YOUR BABY?"cried Zoie, and for the first time she became conscious
of their predicament.She gazed at Aggie in consternation."I forgot all
about it," she said, and then asked with growing anxiety, "What can we
DO?"echoed Aggie, scarcely knowing herself what answer to make, "we've
got to GET it--TO-NIGHT."But," protested Zoie, "how CAN we get it when the mother hasn't signed
the papers yet?""Jimmy will have to arrange that with the Superintendent of the Home,"
answered Aggie with decision, and she turned toward the 'phone to
instruct Jimmy accordingly."Yes, that's right," assented Zoie, glad to be rid of all further
responsibility, "we'll let Jimmy fix it.""Say, Jimmy," called Aggie excitedly, "you'll have to go straight to the
Children's Home and get that baby just as quickly as you can.There's
some red tape about the mother signing papers, but don't mind about
that.Make them give it to you to-night.There was evidently a protest from the other end of the wire, for Aggie
added impatiently, "Go on, Jimmy, do!And with
that she hung up the receiver."Never mind about the clothes," answered Aggie."We're lucky if we get
the baby.""But I have to mind," persisted Zoie."I gave all its other things to
the laundress.And now the horrid
old creature hasn't brought them back yet.""You get into your OWN things," commanded Aggie.asked Zoie, her elation revived by the
thought of her fine raiment, and with that she flew to the foot of the
bed and snatched up two of the prettiest negligees ever imported from
Paris.she asked, as she held them both
aloft, "the pink or the blue?""It doesn't matter," answered Aggie wearily."Get into SOMETHING, that's
all.""Then unhook me," commanded Zoie gaily, as she turned her back to Aggie,
and continued to admire the two "creations" on her arm.So pleased was
she with the picture of herself in either of the garments that she began
humming a gay waltz and swaying to the rhythm."Stand still," commanded Aggie, but her warning was unnecessary, for at
that moment Zoie was transfixed by a horrible fear."Suppose," she said in alarm, "that Jimmy can't GET the baby?""He's GOT to get it," answered Aggie emphatically, and she undid the
last stubborn hook of Zoie's gown and put the girl from her."There,
now, you're all unfastened," she said, "hurry and get dressed.""You mean undressed," laughed Zoie, as she let her pretty evening gown
fall lightly from her shoulders and drew on her pink negligee.she exclaimed, as she caught sight of her reflection in the
mirror, "isn't it a love?"Alfred just adores
pink."answered Aggie, but in spite of herself, she was quite thrilled
by the picture of the exquisite young creature before her.Zoie had
certainly never looked more irresistible."Can't you get some of that
colour out of your cheeks," asked Aggie in despair."I'll put on some cold cream and powder," answered Zoie.She flew to her
dressing table; and in a moment there was a white cloud in her immediate
vicinity.She turned to Aggie to inquire the result."It couldn't be Alfred, could it?"asked Zoie with mingled hope and
dread."Of course not," answered Aggie, as she removed the receiver from the
hook."Alfred wouldn't 'phone, he would come right up."CHAPTER XV

Discovering that it was merely Jimmy "on the wire," Zoie's uneasiness
abated, but Aggie's anxiety was visibly increasing.she
repeated, then followed further explanations from Jimmy which were
apparently not satisfactory.cried his disturbed wife, "it
can't be!shrieked Zoie, trying to get her small ear close enough to
the receiver to catch a bit of the obviously terrifying message."Wait a minute," called Aggie into the 'phone.Then she turned to Zoie
with a look of despair."The mother's changed her mind," she explained;
"she won't give up the baby."cried Zoie, and she sank into the nearest chair.For an
instant the two women looked at each other with blank faces."What can
we DO," asked Zoie.This was indeed a serious predicament;
but presently Zoie saw her friend's mouth becoming very resolute, and
she surmised that Aggie had solved the problem."We'll have to get
ANOTHER baby, that's all," decided Aggie."There, in the Children's Home," answered Aggie with great confidence,
and she returned to the 'phone.Zoie crossed to the bed and knelt at its foot in search of her little
pink slippers."Oh, Aggie," she sighed, "the others were all so red!""Listen, Jimmy," she called in the
'phone, "can't you get another baby?"There was a pause, then Aggie
commanded hotly, "Well, GET in the business!"Another pause and then
Aggie continued very firmly, "Tell the Superintendent that we JUST MUST
have one."Zoie stopped in the act of putting on her second slipper and called a
reminder to Aggie."Tell him to get a HE one," she said, "Alfred wants a
boy."answered Aggie impatiently, and again she gave
her attention to the 'phone.she cried, with growing despair,
and Zoie waited to hear what had gone wrong now."Nothing under three
months," explained Aggie."A three-months' old baby is as big as a
whale.""Well, can't we say it GREW UP?"asked Zoie, priding herself on her
power of ready resource.Almost vanquished by her friend's new air of cold superiority, Zoie
was now on the verge of tears."Somebody must have a new baby," she
faltered."For their own personal USE, yes," admitted Aggie, "but who has a new
baby for US?""You're the one who ought to
know.You got me into this, and you've GOT to get me out of it.Can you
imagine," she asked, growing more and more unhappy, "what would happen
to me if Alfred were to come home now and not find a baby?He wouldn't
forgive a LITTLE lie, what would he do with a WHOPPER like this?"Then
with sudden decision, she rushed toward the 'phone."Let me talk to
Jimmy," she said, and the next moment she was chattering so rapidly and
incoherently over the 'phone that Aggie despaired of hearing one word
that she said, and retired to the next room to think out a new plan of
action."Say, Jimmy," stammered Zoie into the 'phone, "you've GOT to get me a
baby.If you don't, I'll kill myself!You got me
into this, Jimmy," she reminded him."You've GOT to get me out of it."And then followed pleadings and coaxings and cajolings, and at length,
a pause, during which Jimmy was apparently able to get in a word or so.she shrieked, tiptoeing
to get her lips closer to the receiver; then she added with conviction,
"the mother has no business to change her mind."Apparently Jimmy maintained that the mother had changed it none the
less."Well, take it away from her," commanded Zoie."Get it quick, while she
isn't looking."Then casting a furtive glance over her shoulder to make
sure that Aggie was still out of the room, she indulged in a few dark
threats to Jimmy, also some vehement reminders of how he had DRAGGED her
into that horrid old restaurant and been the immediate cause of all the
misfortunes that had ever befallen her.Could Jimmy have been sure that Aggie was out of ear-shot of Zoie's
conversation, the argument would doubtless have kept up indefinitely--as
it was--the result was a quick acquiescence on his part and by the time
that Aggie returned to the room, Zoie was wreathed in smiles."It's all right," she said sweetly."Goodness knows I hope so," she said,
then added in despair, "Look at your cheeks.Once more the powder puff was called into requisition, and Zoie turned a
temporarily blanched face to Aggie."Very much," answered Aggie, "but how about your hair?"Her reflection betrayed a
coiffure that might have turned Marie Antoinette green with envy."Would anybody think you'd been in bed for days?""Alfred likes it that way," was Zoie's defence."Turn around," said Aggie, without deigning to argue the matter further.And she began to remove handfuls of hairpins from the yellow knotted
curls.exclaimed Zoie, as she sprayed her white neck and
arms with her favourite perfume.Zoie leaned forward toward the mirror to smooth out her eyebrows with
the tips of her perfumed fingers."Good gracious," she cried in horror
as she caught sight of her reflection."You're not going to put my hair
in a pigtail!""That's the way invalids always have their hair," was Aggie's laconic
reply, and she continued to plait the obstinate curls.declared Zoie, and she shook herself free
from Aggie's unwelcome attentions and proceeded to unplait the hateful
pigtail."If you're going to make a perfect fright of me," pouted Zoie, "I just
won't see him.""He isn't coming to see YOU," reminded Aggie."He's coming to see the
baby.""If Jimmy doesn't come soon, I'll not HAVE any baby," answered Zoie."Get into bed," said Aggie, and she proceeded to turn down the soft lace
coverlets.Her eyes caught the small knot of
lace and ribbons for which she was looking, and she pinned it on top of
her saucy little curls."In you go," said Aggie, motioning to the bed."Wait," said Zoie impressively, "wait till I get my rose lights on the
pillow."She pulled the slender gold chain of her night lamp; instantly
the large white pillows were bathed in a warm pink glow--she studied
the effect very carefully, then added a lingerie pillow to the two
more formal ones, kicked off her slippers and hopped into bed.One more
glance at the pillows, then she arranged the ribbons of her negligee to
fall "carelessly" outside the coverlet, threw one arm gracefully above
her head, half-closed her eyes, and sank languidly back against her
pillows.Controlling her impulse to smile, Aggie crossed to the dressing-table
with a business-like air and applied to Zoie's pink cheeks a third
coating of powder.Zoie sat bolt upright and began to sneeze."Aggie," she said, "I just
hate you when you act like that."But suddenly she was seized with a new
idea."I wonder," she mused as she looked across the room at the soft, pink
sofa bathed in firelight, "I wonder if I shouldn't look better on that
couch under those roses."Aggie was very emphatic in her opinion to the contrary."Then," decided Zoie with a mischievous smile, "I'll get Alfred to carry
me to the couch.That way I can get my arms around his neck.And once
you get your arms around a man's neck, you can MANAGE him."Aggie looked down at the small person with distinct disapproval."Now,
don't you make too much fuss over Alfred," she continued."YOU'RE the
one who's to do the forgiving.What's more," she
reminded Zoie, "you're very, very weak."But before she had time to
instruct Zoie further there was a sharp, quick ring at the outer door.The two women glanced at each other inquiringly.The next instant a
man's step was heard in the hallway.demanded someone in a voice tense with anxiety."Lie down," commanded Aggie, and Zoie had barely time to fall back
limply on the pillows when the excited young husband burst into the
room.CHAPTER XVI

When Alfred entered Zoie's bedroom he glanced about him in bewilderment.It appeared that he was in an enchanted chamber.Through the dim rose
light he could barely perceive his young wife.She was lying white and
apparently lifeless on her pillows.He moved cautiously toward the bed,
but Aggie raised a warning finger.Afraid to speak, he grasped Aggie's
hand and searched her face for reassurance; she nodded toward Zoie,
whose eyes were closed.He tiptoed to the bedside, sank on his knees and
reverently kissed the small hand that hung limply across the side of the
bed.To Alfred's intense surprise, his lips had barely touched Zoie's
fingertips when he felt his head seized in a frantic embrace."Alfred,
Alfred!"cried Zoie in delight; then she smothered his face with kisses.As she lifted her head to survey her astonished husband, she caught
the reproving eye of Aggie.With a weak little sigh, she relaxed her
tenacious hold of Alfred, breathed his name very faintly, and sank back,
apparently exhausted, upon her pillows."It's been too much for her," said the terrified young husband, and he
glanced toward Aggie in anxiety."How pale she looks," added Alfred, as he surveyed the white face on the
pillows."She's so weak, poor dear," sympathised Aggie, almost in a whisper.Alfred nodded his understanding to Aggie.It was then that his attention
was for the first time attracted toward the crib.And again Zoie forgot Aggie's warning and
sat straight up in bed.He was making
determinedly for the crib, his heart beating high with the pride of
possession.Throwing back the coverlets of the bassinette, Alfred stared at the
empty bed in silence, then he quickly turned to the two anxious women.Zoie's lips opened to answer, but no words came.Alfred's eyes turned to Aggie.The look on her face increased his worst
fears."Don't tell me he's----" he could not bring himself to utter the
word.He continued to look helplessly from one woman to the other.Aggie also made an unsuccessful
attempt to speak.Then, driven to desperation by the strain of the
situation, Zoie declared boldly: "He's out.""With Jimmy," explained Aggie, coming to Zoie's rescue as well as she
knew how."Just for a breath of air," explained Zoie sweetly She had now entirely
regained her self-possession."Isn't he very young to be out at night?"asked Alfred with a puzzled
frown."We told Jimmy that," answered Aggie, amazed at the promptness
with which each succeeding lie presented itself."But you see," she
continued, "Jimmy is so crazy about the child that we can't do anything
with him.""He always
said babies were 'little red worms.'""Not this one," answered Zoie sweetly."No, indeed," chimed in Aggie."I'll soon put a stop to that,"
he declared.Again the two women looked at each other inquiringly, then Aggie
stammered evasively."Oh, j-just downstairs--somewhere.""I'll LOOK j-just downstairs somewhere," decided Alfred, and he snatched
up his hat and started toward the door.Coming back to her bedside to reassure her, Alfred was caught in a
frantic embrace."I'll be back in a minute, dear," he said, but Zoie
clung to him and pleaded desperately."You aren't going to leave me the very first thing?"He had no wish to be cruel to Zoie, but the thought of
Jimmy out in the street with his baby at this hour of the night was not
to be borne."Now, dearie," she said, "I
wish you'd go get shaved and wash up a bit.I don't wish baby to see you
looking so horrid.""Yes, do, Alfred," insisted Aggie."He's sure to be here in a minute.""My boy won't care HOW his father looks," declared Alfred proudly, and
Zoie told Aggie afterward that his chest had momentarily expanded three
inches."But _I_ care," persisted Zoie."Now, Zoie," cautioned Aggie, as she crossed toward the bed with
affected solicitude.Zoie was quick to understand the suggested change in her tactics, and
again she sank back on her pillows apparently ill and faint.Utterly vanquished by the dire result of his apparently inhuman
thoughtlessness, Alfred glanced at Aggie, uncertain as to how to repair
the injury.Aggie beckoned to him to come away from the bed."Let her have her own way," she whispered with a significant glance
toward Zoie.Alfred nodded understandingly and put a finger to his lips to signify
that he would henceforth speak in hushed tones, then he tiptoed back to
the bed and gently stroked the curls from Zoie's troubled forehead."There now, dear," he whispered, "lie still and rest and I'll go shave
and wash up a bit.""Mind," he whispered to Aggie, "you are to call me the moment my boy
comes," and then he slipped quietly into the bedroom.No sooner had Alfred crossed the threshold, than Zoie sat up in bed and
called in a sharp whisper to Aggie, "What's keeping them?""I can't imagine," answered Aggie, also in whisper."If I had Jimmy here," declared Zoie vindictively, "I'd wring his little
fat neck," and slipping her little pink toes from beneath the covers,
she was about to get out of bed, when Aggie, who was facing Alfred's
bedroom door, gave her a warning signal.Zoie had barely time to get back beneath the covers, when Alfred
re-entered the room in search of his satchel.Aggie found it for him
quickly.Alfred glanced solicitously at Zoie's closed eyes."I'm so sorry," he
apologised to Aggie, and again he slipped softly out of the room.Aggie and Zoie drew together for consultation."Suppose Jimmy can't get the baby," whispered Zoie."In that case, he'd have 'phoned," argued Aggie."Let's 'phone to the Home," suggested Zoie, "and find----" She was
interrupted by Alfred's voice."Say, Aggie," called Alfred from the next room.answered Aggie sweetly, and she crossed to the door and waited."Not yet, Alfred," said Aggie, and she closed the door very softly, lest
Alfred should hear her."I never knew Alfred could be so silly!"warned Aggie, and she glanced anxiously toward Alfred's door."He doesn't care a bit about me!""It's all that horrid
old baby that he's never seen.""If Jimmy doesn't come soon, he never WILL see it," declared Aggie, and
she started toward the window to look out.Just then there was a short quick ring of the bell.The two women
glanced at each other with mingled hope and fear.Then their eyes sought
the door expectantly.CHAPTER XVII

With the collar of his long ulster pushed high and the brim of his derby
hat pulled low, Jimmy Jinks crept cautiously into the room.When he at
length ceased to glance over his shoulder and came to a full stop, Aggie
perceived a bit of white flannel hanging beneath the hem of his tightly
buttoned coat."Give it to me," demanded Aggie.Jimmy stared at them as though stupefied, then glanced uneasily over his
shoulder, to make sure that no one was pursuing him.Aggie unbuttoned
his ulster, seized a wee mite wrapped in a large shawl, and clasped it
to her bosom with a sigh of relief.she exclaimed, then
crossed quickly to the bassinette and deposited her charge.In the meantime, having thrown discretion to the wind, Zoie had hopped
out of bed.As usual, her greeting to Jimmy was in the nature of a
reproach."Yes," chimed in Aggie, who was now bending over the crib.answered Jimmy hotly, "if you two think you can do any
better, you're welcome to the job," and with that he threw off his
overcoat and sank sullenly on the couch.exclaimed Zoie and Aggie, simultaneously, and they glanced
nervously toward Alfred's bedroom door.Jimmy looked at them without comprehending why he should "sh."Instead, Zoie turned her back upon him."Let's see it," she said, peeping into the bassinette.And then with a
little cry of disgust she again looked at Jimmy reproachfully.Jimmy's contempt for woman's ingratitude was too
deep for words, and he only stared at her in injured silence.But his
reflections were quickly upset when Alfred called from the next room, to
inquire again about Baby.whispered Jimmy, beginning to realise the meaning of
the women's mysterious behaviour.said Aggie again to Jimmy, and Zoie flew toward the bed,
almost vaulting over the footboard in her hurry to get beneath the
covers.For the present Alfred did not disturb them further.Apparently he was
still occupied with his shaving, but just as Jimmy was about to ask for
particulars, the 'phone rang.The three culprits glanced guiltily at
each other.whispered Zoie in a frightened voice.Jimmy paused in the act of sitting and turned his round eyes toward the
'phone."But we can't," she was
saying; "that's impossible."called Zoie across the foot of the bed, unable longer to
endure the suspense."How dare you call my husband a
thief!""Wait a minute," said Aggie, then she left the receiver hanging by the
cord and turned to the expectant pair behind her."It's the Children's
Home," she explained."That awful woman says Jimmy STOLE her baby!"exclaimed Zoie as though such depravity on Jimmy's part were
unthinkable.Then she looked at him accusingly, and asked in low,
measured tones, "DID you STEAL HER BABY, JIMMY?""How else COULD I steal a baby?"Zoie looked at the unfortunate creature as if she could strangle him,
and Aggie addressed him with a threat in her voice."Well, the Superintendent says you've got to bring it straight back.""He sha'n't bring it back," declared Zoie.asked Aggie, "he's holding the
wire.""Tell him he can't have it," answered Zoie, as though that were the end
of the whole matter."Well," concluded Aggie, "he says if Jimmy DOESN'T bring it back the
mother's coming after it."As for Jimmy, he bolted for the door.Aggie caught him by the sleeve as
he passed."Wait, Jimmy," she said peremptorily.There was a moment of
awful indecision, then something approaching an idea came to Zoie."Tell the Superintendent that it isn't here," she whispered to Aggie
across the footboard."Tell him that Jimmy hasn't got here yet.""Yes," agreed Jimmy, "tell him I haven't got here yet."Aggie nodded wisely and returned to the 'phone."Hello," she called
pleasantly; then proceeded to explain.There was a pause, then she added in her most conciliatory tone, "I'll
tell him what you say when he comes in."Another pause, and she hung up
the receiver with a most gracious good-bye and turned to the others with
increasing misgivings."He says he won't be responsible for that mother
much longer--she's half-crazy.""Well," decided Aggie after careful deliberation, "you'd better take it
back, Jimmy, before Alfred sees it."And again Jimmy bolted, but again he
failed to reach the door.CHAPTER XVIII

His face covered with lather, and a shaving brush in one hand, Alfred
entered the room just as his friend was about to escape.exclaimed the excited young father, "you're back.""Oh, yes--yes," admitted Jimmy nervously, "I'm back."cried Alfred, and he glanced toward the crib."Yes--yes," agreed Aggie uneasily, as she tried to place herself between
Alfred and the bassinette."He's here, but you mayn't have him, Alfred."exclaimed Alfred, trying to put her out of the way."Not yet," protested Aggie, "not just yet.""Give him to me," demanded Alfred, and thrusting Aggie aside, he took
possession of the small mite in the cradle."But--but, Alfred," pleaded Aggie, "your face.He was bending over the cradle in an ecstasy.Lifting the baby in his arms he circled
the room cooing to him delightedly."Was he away from home when his fadder came?Suddenly he remembered to whom he owed this wondrous
treasure and forgetful of the lather on his unshaven face he rushed
toward Zoie with an overflowing heart.he exclaimed, and
he covered her cheek with kisses.cried Zoie in disgust and she pushed Alfred from her and
brushed the hateful lather from her little pink check.But Alfred was not to be robbed of his exaltation, and again he circled
the room, making strange gurgling sounds to Baby."Did a horrid old Jimmy take him away from fadder?"he said
sympathetically, in the small person's ear; and he glanced at Jimmy with
frowning disapproval."I'd just like to see him get you away from me
again!"he added to Baby, as he tickled the mite's ear with the end of
his shaving brush.he exclaimed in trepidation, as he
perceived a bit of lather on the infant's cheek.Then lifting the boy
high in his arms and throwing out his chest with great pride, he looked
at Jimmy with an air of superiority."I guess I'm bad, aye?"As for Zoie, she was growing more and more
impatient for a little attention to herself."Rock-a-bye, Baby," sang Alfred in strident tones and he swung the child
high in his arms.Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Alfred as though hypnotised.They kept time to
his lullaby out of sheer nervousness.Suddenly Alfred stopped, held the
child from him and gazed at it in horror."Look at that baby's face," commanded
Alfred.Zoie and Aggie exchanged alarmed glances, then Zoie asked in
trepidation, "What's the matter with his face?""He's got a fever," declared Alfred.And he started toward the bed to
show the child to its mother.shrieked Zoie, waving Alfred off in wild alarm.asked Alfred, backing from her in surprise.Aggie crossed quickly to Alfred's side and looked over his shoulder at
the boy."I don't see anything wrong with its face," she said."Oh," said Jimmy with a superior air, "they're always like that.""Nothing of the sort," snorted Alfred, and he glared at Jimmy
threateningly."You've frozen the child parading him around the
streets.""Let me have him, Alfred," begged Aggie sweetly; "I'll put him in his
crib and keep him warm."His eyes followed him to the crib
with anxiety.he asked, as he glanced first from
one to the other.Zoie and Jimmy stared about the room as though expecting the desired
person to drop from the ceiling.Then Zoie turned upon her unwary
accomplice."Jimmy," she called in a threatening tone, "where IS his nurse?""Does Jimmy take the nurse out, too?"demanded Alfred, more and more
annoyed by the privileges Jimmy had apparently been usurping in his
absence."Never mind about the nurse," interposed Aggie.I'll tuck him in," and she bent fondly over the crib, but Alfred
was not to be so easily pacified."Do you mean to tell me," he exclaimed excitedly, "that my boy hasn't
any nurse?""We HAD a nurse," corrected Zoie, "but--but I had to discharge her."Alfred glanced from one to the other for an explanation."She was crazy," stammered Zoie.Alfred's eyes sought Aggie's for confirmation.The latter jerked his head up and down in
nervous assent."Well," said Alfred, amazed at their apparent lack of resource, "why
didn't you get ANOTHER nurse?""Aggie is going to stay and take care of baby to-night," declared Zoie,
and then she beamed upon Aggie as only she knew how."Yes, indeed," answered Aggie, studiously avoiding Jimmy's eye."Baby is going to sleep in the spare room with Aggie and Jimmy," said
Zoie.exclaimed Jimmy, too desperate to care what Alfred might infer.Ignoring Jimmy's implied protest, Zoie continued sweetly to Alfred:

"Now, don't worry, dear; go back to your room and finish your shaving."Then his hand went
mechanically to his cheek and he stared at Zoie in astonishment.he exclaimed, "I had forgotten all about it.That shows you how
excited I am."And with a reluctant glance toward the cradle, he went
quickly from the room, singing a high-pitched lullaby.Just as the three conspirators were drawing together for consultation,
Alfred returned to the room.It was apparent that there was something
important on his mind."By the way," he said, glancing from one to another, "I forgot to
ask--what's his name?"The conspirators looked at each other without answering.Of course his son had been given his father's name,
but he wished to HEAR someone say so."Baby's, I mean," he explained impatiently.Jimmy felt instinctively that Zoie's eyes were upon him.called Zoie, meaning only to appeal to him for a name.After waiting in vain for any response, Alfred advanced upon the
uncomfortable Jimmy."You seem to be very popular around here," he sneered.Jimmy shifted uneasily from one foot to the other and studied the
pattern of the rug upon which he was standing.After what seemed an age to Jimmy, Alfred turned his back upon his old
friend and started toward his bedroom.Jimmy peeped out uneasily from
his long eyelashes.When Alfred reached the threshold, he faced about
quickly and stared again at Jimmy for an explanation.It seemed to Jimmy
that Alfred's nostrils were dilating.He would not have been surprised
to see Alfred snort fire.He let his eyes fall before the awful
spectacle of his friend's wrath.Alfred's upper lip began to curl.He
cast a last withering look in Jimmy's direction, retired quickly from
the scene and banged the door.When Jimmy again had the courage to lift his eyes he was confronted by
the contemptuous gaze of Zoie, who was sitting up in bed and regarding
him with undisguised disapproval."Why didn't you tell him what the baby's name is?""How do _I_ know what the baby's name is?"cautioned Aggie as she glanced nervously toward the door
through which Alfred had just passed."What does it matter WHAT the baby's name is so long as we have to send
it back?""I'll NOT send it back," declared Zoie emphatically, "at least not until
morning.That will give Jimmy a whole night to get another one.""See here, you two can't be changing babies
every five minutes without Alfred knowing it."You know perfectly well that all
young babies look just alike.Their own mothers couldn't tell them
apart, if it weren't for their clothes."Before Aggie could answer, Alfred was again heard calling from the next
room.Apparently all his anger had subsided, for he inquired in the most
amiable tone as to what baby might be doing and how he might be feeling.Aggie crossed quickly to the door, and sweetly reassured the anxious
father, then she closed the door softly and turned to Zoie and Jimmy
with a new inspiration lighting her face."I have it," she exclaimed
ecstatically."Now see here," he objected, "every time YOU 'HAVE IT,' I DO IT.The
NEXT time you 'HAVE IT' YOU DO IT!"The emphasis with which Jimmy made his declaration deserved
consideration, but to his amazement it was entirely ignored by both
women.Hopping quickly out of bed, without even glancing in his
direction, Zoie gave her entire attention to Aggie."There must be OTHER babies' Homes," said Aggie, and she glanced at
Jimmy from her superior height."They aren't open all night like corner drug stores," growled Jimmy."Well, they ought to be," decided Zoie."And surely," argued Aggie, "in an extraordinary case--like----"

"This was an 'extraordinary case,'" declared Jimmy, "and you saw what
happened this time, and the Superintendent is a friend of mine--at least
he WAS a friend of mine."And with that Jimmy sat himself down on the
far corner of the couch and proceeded to ruminate on the havoc that
these two women had wrought in his once tranquil life.Zoie gazed at Jimmy in deep disgust; her friend Aggie had made an
excellent suggestion, and instead of acting upon it with alacrity, here
sat Jimmy sulking like a stubborn child."I suppose," said Zoie, as her eyebrows assumed a bored angle, "there
are SOME babies in the world outside of Children's Homes.""Of course," was Aggie's enthusiastic rejoinder; "there's one born every
minute.""But I was born BETWEEN minutes," protested Jimmy.Again Aggie exclaimed that she "had it.""She's got it twice as bad," groaned Jimmy, and he wondered what new
form her persecution of him was about to take."We can't advertise NOW," protested Zoie.answered Aggie, as she snatched the paper quickly from
the table and began running her eyes up and down its third page."Married--married," she murmured, and then with delight she found
the half column for which she was searching."Born," she exclaimed
triumphantly.Get a pencil, Zoie, and we'll take down all
the new ones.""Of course," agreed Zoie, clapping her hands in glee, "and Jimmy can get
a taxi and look them right up."shouted Jimmy as he rose with clenched fists."Now you
two, see here----"

Before Jimmy could complete his threat, there was a sharp ring of the
door bell.He looked at the two women inquiringly."It's the mother," cried Zoie in a hoarse whisper.repeated Jimmy in terror and he glanced uncertainly from
one door to the other.called Zoie, and drawing Jimmy's overcoat quickly
from his arm, Aggie threw it hurriedly over the cradle.For an instant Jimmy remained motionless in the centre of the room,
hatless, coatless, and shorn of ideas.A loud knock on the door decided
him and he sank with trembling knees behind the nearest armchair, just
as Zoie made a flying leap into the bed and prepared to draw the cover
over her head.The knock was repeated and Aggie signalled to Zoie to answer it.CHAPTER XIX

From his hiding-place Jimmy peeped around the edge of the armchair and
saw what seemed to be a large clothes basket entering the room.Closer
inspection revealed the small figure of Maggie, the washerwoman's
daughter, propelling the basket, which was piled high with freshly
laundered clothing.Jimmy drew a long sigh of relief, and unknotted his
cramped limbs."Shall I lay the things on the sofa, mum?"asked Maggie as she placed
her basket on the floor and waited for Zoie's instructions."Yes, please," answered Zoie, too exhausted for further comment.Taking the laundry piece by piece from the basket, Maggie made excuses
for its delay, while she placed it on the couch.Deaf to Maggie's
chatter, Zoie lay back languidly on her pillows; but she soon heard
something that lifted her straight up in bed."Me mother is sorry she had to kape you waitin' this week," said Maggie
over her shoulder; "but we've got twins at OUR house."Then together they stared
at Maggie as though she had been dropped from another world.Finding attention temporarily diverted from himself, Jimmy had begun to
rearrange both his mind and his cravat when he felt rather than saw that
his two persecutors were regarding him with a steady, determined gaze.In spite of himself, Jimmy raised his eyes to theirs.Now, Jimmy had heard Maggie's announcement about the bountiful supply
of offspring lately arrived at her house, but not until he caught the
fanatical gleam in the eyes of his companions did he understand the
part they meant him to play in their next adventure.He waited for no
explanation--he bolted toward the door.But it was not until she had laid firm
hold of him that he waited.Surprised by such strange behaviour on the part of those whom she
considered her superiors, Maggie looked first at Aggie, then at Jimmy,
then at Zoie, uncertain whether to go or to stay."Anythin' to go back, mum?"Zoie stared at Maggie solemnly from across the foot of the bed."Maggie," she asked in a deep, sepulchral tone, "where do you live?""Just around the corner on High Street, mum," gasped Maggie.Then,
keeping her eyes fixed uneasily on Zoie she picked up her basket and
backed cautiously toward the door.commanded Zoie; and Maggie paused, one foot in mid-air."Wait in
the hall," said Zoie."Yes'um," assented Maggie, almost in a whisper.Then she nodded her
head jerkily, cast another furtive glance at the three persons who were
regarding her so strangely, and slipped quickly through the door.Having crossed the room and stealthily closed the door, Aggie returned
to Jimmy, who was watching her with the furtive expression of a trapped
animal."It's Providence," she declared, with a grave countenance.Jimmy looked up at Aggie with affected innocence, then rolled his round
eyes away from her.He was confronted by Zoie, who had approached from
the opposite side of the room."It's Fate," declared Zoie, in awe-struck tones.Jimmy was beginning to wriggle, but he kept up a last desperate presence
of not understanding them."You needn't tell me I'm going to take the wash to the old lady," he
said, "for I'm not going to do it.""It isn't the WASH," said Aggie, and her tone warned him that she
expected no nonsense from him."You know what we are thinking about just as well as we do," said Zoie."I'll write that washerwoman a note and tell her we must have one of
those babies right now."And with that she turned toward her desk and
began rummaging amongst her papers for a pencil and pad."The luck of
these poor," she murmured."The luck of US," corrected Aggie, whose spirits were now soaring.Then
she turned to Jimmy with growing enthusiasm."Just think of it, dear,"
she said, "Fate has sent us a baby to our very door.""Well," declared Jimmy, again beginning to show signs of fight, "if
Fate has sent a baby to the door, you don't need me," and with that he
snatched his coat from the crib."Wait, Jimmy," again commanded Aggie, and she took his coat gently but
firmly from him."Now, see here," argued Jimmy, trying to get free from his strong-minded
spouse, "you know perfectly well that that washerwoman isn't going to
let us have that baby.""Nonsense," called Zoie over her shoulder, while she scribbled a hurried
note to the washerwoman."If she won't let us have it 'for keeps,' I'll
just'rent it.'""Warm, fresh,
palpitating babies rented as you would rent a gas stove!""That's all a pose," declared Aggie, in a matter-of-fact tone."You
think babies 'little red worms,' you've said so.""She'll be only too glad to rent it," declared Zoie, as she glanced
hurriedly through the note just written, and slipped it, together with
a bill, into an envelope.It's only until I can
get another one."shouted Jimmy, and his eyes turned heavenward for help."An
endless chain with me to put the links together!""Don't be so theatrical," said Aggie, irritably, as she took up Jimmy's
coat and prepared to get him into it."Why DO you make such a fuss about NOTHING," sighed Zoie.echoed Jimmy, and he looked at her with wondering eyes."I crawl about like a thief in the night snatching babies from their
mother's breasts, and you call THAT nothing?""You don't have to 'CRAWL,'" reminded Zoie, "you can take a taxi.""Here's your coat, dear," said Aggie graciously, as she endeavoured to
slip Jimmy's limp arms into the sleeves of the garment."You can take Maggie with you," said Zoie, with the air of conferring a
distinct favour upon him."And the wash on my lap," added Jimmy sarcastically."No," said Zoie, unruffled by Jimmy's ungracious behaviour."That's very kind of you," sneered Jimmy, as he unconsciously allowed
his arms to slip into the sleeves of the coat Aggie was urging upon him."All you need to do," said Aggie complacently, "is to get us the baby.""Yes," said Jimmy, "and what do you suppose my friends would say if they
were to see me riding around town with the wash-lady's daughter and a
baby on my lap?he asked Aggie, "if you didn't know
the facts?""Nobody's going to see you," answered Aggie impatiently; "it's only
around the corner.Go on, Jimmy, be a good boy.""You mean a good thing," retorted Jimmy without budging from the spot.exclaimed Zoie; "it's as easy as can be.""Yes, the FIRST one SOUNDED easy, too," said Jimmy."All you have to do," explained Zoie, trying to restrain her rising
intolerance of his stupidity, "is to give this note to Maggie's mother.She'll give you her baby, you bring it back here, we'll give you THIS
one, and you can take it right back to the Home.""And meet the other mother," concluded Jimmy with a shake of his head.There was a distinct threat in Zoie's voice when she again addressed the
stubborn Jimmy and the glitter of triumph was in her eyes."You'd better meet here THERE than HERE," she warned him; "you know what
the Superintendent said.""That's true," agreed Aggie with an anxious face."Come now," she
pleaded, "it will only take a minute; you can do the whole thing before
you have had time to think.""Before I have had time to think," repeated Jimmy excitedly."That's how
you get me to do everything.Well, this time I've HAD time to think and
I don't think I will!"and with that he threw himself upon the couch,
unmindful of the damage to the freshly laundered clothes."You haven't time to sit down," said Aggie."I'll TAKE time," declared Jimmy.His eyes blinked ominously and he
remained glued to the couch.There was a short silence; the two women gazed at Jimmy in despair.Remembering a fresh grievance, Jimmy turned upon them."By the way," he said, "do you two know that I haven't had anything to
eat yet?""And do you know," said Zoie, "that Alfred may be back at any minute?"Not unless he has cut his throat," rejoined Jimmy, "and that's what I'd
do if I had a razor."Zoie regarded Jimmy as though he were beyond redemption."Can't you ever
think of anybody but yourself?"she asked, with a martyred air.Had Jimmy been half his age, Aggie would have felt sure that she saw him
make a face at her friend for answer.As it was, she resolved to make
one last effort to awaken her unobliging spouse to a belated sense of
duty."You see, dear," she said, "you might better get the washerwoman's baby
than to go from house to house for one," and she glanced again toward
the paper."Yes," urged Zoie, "and that's just what you'll HAVE to do, if you don't
get this one."It was apparent that his courage was
slipping from him.Aggie was quick to realise her opportunity, and
before Jimmy could protect himself from her treacherous wiles, she had
slipped one arm coyly about his neck."Now, Jimmy," she pleaded as she pressed her soft cheek to his throbbing
temple, and toyed with the bay curl on his perspiring forehead, "wont
you do this little teeny-weepy thing just for me?"Jimmy's lips puckered in a pout; he began to blink nervously.Aggie
slipped her other arm about his neck."You know," she continued with a baby whine, "I got Zoie into this, and
I've just got to get her out of it.You're not going to desert me,
are you, Jimmy?You WILL help me, won't you, dear?"Her breath was on
Jimmy's cheek; he could feel her lips stealing closer to his.He had not
been treated to much affection of late.His head drooped lower--he began
to twiddle the fob on his watch chain.she repeated, and her soft eyelashes just brushed the tip
of his retrousee nose.Jimmy's head was now wagging from side to side.she entreated a fourth time, and she kissed him full on the
lips.With a resigned sigh, Jimmy rose mechanically from the heap of crushed
laundry and held out his fat chubby hand."Give me the letter," he groaned."Here you are," said Zoie, taking Jimmy's acquiescence as a matter of
course; and she thrust the letter into the pocket of Jimmy's ulster."Now, when you get back with the baby," she continued, "don't come in
all of a sudden; just wait outside and whistle.You CAN WHISTLE, can't
you?"For answer, Jimmy placed two fingers between his lips and produced a
shrill whistle that made both Zoie and Aggie glance nervously toward
Alfred's bedroom door."Yes, you can WHISTLE," admitted Zoie, then she continued her
directions."If Alfred is not in the room, I'll raise the shade and you
can come right up."asked Jimmy with a fine shade of sarcasm."If he IS in the room," explained Zoie, "you must wait outside until I
can get rid of him."Jimmy turned his eyes toward Aggie to ask if it were possible that she
still approved of Zoie's inhuman plan.For answer Aggie stroked his coat
collar fondly."We'll give you the signal the moment the coast is clear," she said,
then she hurriedly buttoned Jimmy's large ulster and wound a muffler
about his neck."There now, dear, do go, you're all buttoned up," and
with that she urged him toward the door."Just a minute," protested Jimmy, as he paused on the threshold."Let me
get this right, if the shade is up, I stay down.""Not at all," corrected Aggie and Zoie in a breath."If the shade is up,
you come up."Jimmy cast another martyred look in Zoie's direction.he said, "you know it is only twenty-three
below zero and I haven't had anything to eat yet--and----"

"Yes, we know," interrupted the two women in chorus, and then Aggie
added wearily, "go on, Jimmy; don't be funny.""With a baby on my lap and the wash lady's
daughter, I won't be funny, oh no!"It is doubtful whether Jimmy would not have worked himself into another
state of open rebellion had not Aggie put an end to his protests by
thrusting him firmly out of the room and closing the door behind him.After this act of heroic decision on her part, the two women listened
intently, fearing that he might return; but presently they heard the
bang of the outer door, and at last they drew a long breath of relief.For the first time since Alfred's arrival, Aggie was preparing to sink
into a chair, when she was startled by a sharp exclamation from Zoie."Good heavens," cried Zoie, "I forgot to ask Maggie.""Boys or girls," said Zoie, with a solemn look toward the door through
which Jimmy had just disappeared."Well," decided Aggie, after a moment's reflection, "it's too late now.Anyway," she concluded philosophically, "we couldn't CHANGE it."CHAPTER XX

With more or less damage to himself consequent on his excitement, Alfred
completed his shaving and hastened to return to his wife and the babe.Finding the supposedly ill Zoie careering about the centre of the room
expostulating with Aggie, the young man stopped dumbfounded on the
threshold."Zoie," he cried in astonishment.For an instant the startled Zoie gazed at him stupefied."Why, I--I----" Her eyes sought Aggie's for a suggestion; there was no
answer there.It was not until her gaze fell upon the cradle that she
was seized by the desired inspiration."I just got up to see baby," she faltered, then putting one hand giddily
to her head, she pretended to sway.In an instant Alfred's arms were about her."You stay here, my darling," he said tenderly."I'll bring baby
to you," and after a solicitous caress he turned toward baby's crib and
bent fondly over the little one."Ah, there's father's man," he said.Oh, goodis g'acious," then followed an incoherent
muttering of baby talk, as he bore the youngster toward Zoie's bed."Come, my precious," he called to Zoie, as he sank down on the edge of
the bed.It had suddenly dawned upon her that
this was the name by which Alfred would no doubt call her for the rest
of her life.But Alfred did not see the look of disgust on Zoie's face."What a funny face," he cooed as he pinched the youngster's cheek."Great Scott, what a grip," he cried as the infant's fingers closed
around his own."Will you look at the size of those hands," he
exclaimed.Zoie and Aggie exchanged worried glances; the baby had no doubt
inherited his large hands from his mother."Say, Aggie," called Alfred, "what are all of these little specks
on baby's forehead?""One, two,
three," he counted.Zoie was becoming more and more uncomfortable at the close proximity of
the little stranger."Oh," said Aggie, with affected carelessness as she leaned over Alfred's
shoulder and glanced at baby's forehead.exclaimed Alfred excitedly, "that's dangerous, isn't it?And he rose and started hurriedly toward the
telephone, baby in arms."Don't be silly," called Zoie, filled with vague alarm at the thought of
the family physician's appearance and the explanations that this might
entail.Stepping between Alfred and the 'phone, Aggie protested frantically."You see, Alfred," she said, "it is better to have the rash OUT, it
won't do any harm unless it turns IN.""He's perfectly well," declared Zoie, "if you'll only put him in his
crib and leave him alone."he asked, and he
tickled the little fellow playfully in the ribs."I'll tell you what,"
he called over his shoulder to Zoie, "he's a fine looking boy."And then
with a mysterious air, he nodded to Aggie to approach.Aggie glanced at her, uncertain what
answer to make."I--I hadn't thought," she stammered weakly."Go on, go on," exclaimed the proud young father, "you can't tell me
that you can look at that boy and not see the resemblance.""Why," said Alfred, "he's the image of Zoie."Zoie gazed at the puckered red face in Alfred's arms.she
shrieked in disgust, then fall back on her pillows and drew the lace
coverlet over her face.Mistaking Zoie's feeling for one of embarrassment at being over-praised,
Alfred bore the infant to her bedside."See, dear," he persisted, "see
for yourself, look at his forehead.""I'd rather look at you," pouted Zoie, peeping from beneath the
coverlet, "if you would only put that thing down for a minute."exclaimed Alfred, as though doubting his own ears.But before
he could remonstrate further, Zoie's arms were about his neck and she
was pleading jealously for his attention."Please, Alfred," she begged, "I have scarcely had a look at you, yet."Alfred shook his head and turned to baby with an indulgent smile.It was
pleasant to have two such delightful creatures bidding for his entire
attention."Dear me, tink of mudder wanting to look at
a big u'gy t'ing like fadder, when she could look at a 'itty witty t'ing
like dis," and he rose and crossed to the crib where he deposited the
small creature with yet more gurgling and endearing.Zoie's dreams of rapture at Alfred's home coming had not included such
divided attention as he was now showing her and she was growing more and
more desperate at the turn affairs had taken.She resolved to put a stop
to his nonsense and to make him realise that she and no one else was the
lode star of his existence.She beckoned to Aggie to get out of the
room and to leave her a clear field and as soon as her friend had gone
quietly into the next room, she called impatiently to Alfred who was
still cooing rapturously over the young stranger.Finding Alfred deaf
to her first entreaty, Zoie shut her lips hard, rearranged her pretty
head-dress, drew one fascinating little curl down over her shoulder,
reknotted the pink ribbon of her negligee, and then issued a final and
imperious order for her husband to attend her."Yes, yes, dear," answered Alfred, with a shade of impatience."I'm
coming, I'm coming."And bidding a reluctant farewell to the small
person in the crib, he crossed to her side.Zoie caught Alfred's hand and drew him down to her; he smiled
complacently."Well," he said in the patronising tone that Zoie always resented."How
is hubby's little girl?""It's about time," pouted Zoie, "that you made a little fuss over me for
a change."He stooped to kiss the eager lips, but just
as his young wife prepared to lend herself to his long delayed embrace,
his mind was distracted by an uneasy thought."Do you think that Baby
is----"

He was not permitted to finish the sentence.Zoie drew him back to her with a sharp exclamation."Think of ME for a while," she commanded."My darling," expostulated Alfred with a shade of surprise at her
vehemence.Again he stooped to
embrace her and again his mind was directed otherwise."I wonder if Baby
is warm enough," he said and attempted to rise."Wonder about ME for a while," snapped Zoie, clinging to him
determinedly.Was it possible there was
anything besides Baby worth wondering about?Whether there was or not,
Zoie was no longer to be resisted and with a last regretful look at the
crib, he resigned himself to giving his entire attention to his spoiled
young wife.Gratified by her hard-won conquest, Zoie now settled herself in Alfred's
arms."You haven't told me what you did all the time that you were away," she
reminded him."Oh, there was plenty to do," answered Alfred."That would be telling," laughed Alfred, as he pinched her small pink
ear."I wish to be 'told,'" declared Zoie; "I don't suppose you realise it,
but if I were to live a THOUSAND YEARS, I'd never be quite sure what you
did during those FEW MONTHS.""It was nothing that you wouldn't have been proud of," answered Alfred,
with an unconscious expansion of his chest."Do you love me as much as ever?""Behave yourself," answered Alfred, trying not to appear flattered
by the discovery that his absence had undoubtedly caused her great
uneasiness."You know I do," answered Alfred, with the diffidence of a school boy."Then kiss me," concluded Zoie, with an air of finality that left Alfred
no alternative.As a matter of fact, Alfred was no longer seeking an alternative.He was
again under the spell of his wife's adorable charms and he kissed her
not once, but many times."Foolish child," he murmured, then he laid her tenderly against the
large white pillows, remonstrating with her for being so spoiled, and
cautioning her to be a good little girl while he went again to see about
Baby.Zoie clung to his hand and feigned approaching tears."You aren't thinking of me at all?""And kisses are no
good unless you put your whole mind on them.Again Alfred stooped to humour the small importunate person who was so
jealous of his every thought, but just as his lips touched her forehead
his ear was arrested by a sound as yet new both to him and to Zoie."I don't know," answered Zoie, wondering if the cat could have got into
the room.A redoubled effort on the part of the young stranger directed their
attention in the right direction.exclaimed Alfred tragically, "it's Baby.And
with that, he rushed to the crib and clasped the small mite close to his
breast, leaving Zoie to pummel the pillows in an agony of vexation.After vain cajoling of the angry youngster, Alfred bore him excitedly to
Zoie's bedside."You'd better take him, dear," he said.To the young husband's astonishment, Zoie waved him from her in terror,
and called loudly for Aggie.But no sooner had Aggie appeared on the
scene, than a sharp whistle was heard from the pavement below.Attributing Zoie's uneasiness to a caprice of modesty, Alfred turned
from the cradle to reassure her."No one can see in way up here," he said.To Zoie's distress, the lowering of the shade was answered by a yet
shriller whistle from the street below."Was it 'up' or 'down'?"cried Zoie to Aggie in an agony of doubt, as
she tried to recall her instructions to Jimmy."I don't know," answered Aggie.Alarmed by
Zoie's increasing excitement, and thinking she was troubled merely by
a sick woman's fancy that someone might see through the window, Alfred
placed the babe quickly in its cradle and crossed to the young wife's
bed."It was up, dear," he said."Then I want it up," declared the seemingly perverse Zoie.A succession of emotional whistles set Zoie to pounding the pillows."Did I say 'up' or did I say 'down'?"moaned the half-demented Zoie,
while long whistles and short whistles, appealing whistles and impatient
whistles followed each other in quick succession."You said down, dear," persisted Alfred, now almost as distracted as his
wife.Sandra moved to the bedroom."I wish you'd get out of here," she cried;
"you make me so nervous that I can't think at all.""Of course, dear," murmured Alfred, "if you wish it."And with a hurt
and perplexed expression on his face he backed quickly from the room.CHAPTER XXI

When Zoie's letter asking for the O'Flarety twin had reached that young
lady's astonished mother, Mrs.O'Flarety felt herself suddenly lifted to
a position of importance.Hardy a wantin' my little Bridget," she
exclaimed, and she began to dwell upon the romantic possibilities of
her offspring's future under the care of such a "foine stylish lady and
concluded by declaring it 'a lucky day entoirely.'"Jimmy had his misgivings about it being Bridget's "LUCKY day," but it
was not for him to delay matters by dwelling upon the eccentricities
of Zoie's character, and when Mrs.O'Flarety had deposited Bridget in
Jimmy's short arms and slipped a well filled nursing bottle into his
overcoat pocket, he took his leave hastily, lest the excited woman add
Bridget's twin to her willing offering.Once out of sight of the elated mother, Jimmy thrust the defenceless
Bridget within the folds of his already snug ulster, buttoned the
garment in such places as it would meet, and made for the taxi which,
owing to the upset condition of the street, he had been obliged to
abandon at the corner.Whether the driver had obtained a more promising "fare" or been run
in by the police, Jimmy never knew.At any rate it was in vain that he
looked for his vehicle.So intense was the cold that it was impossible
to wait for a chance taxi; furthermore, the meanness of the district
made it extremely unlikely that one would appear, and glancing guiltily
behind him to make sure that no one was taking cognisance of his strange
exploit, Jimmy began picking his way along dark lanes and avoiding the
lighted thoroughfare on which the "Sherwood" was situated, until he was
within a block of his destination.Panting with haste and excitement, he eventually gained courage to
dash through a side street that brought him within a few doors of the
"Sherwood."Again glancing behind him, he turned the well lighted corner
and arrived beneath Zoie's window to find one shade up and one down.In
his perplexity he emitted a faint whistle.Immediately he saw the other
shade lowered.Uncertain as to what arrangement he had actually made
with Zoie, he ventured a second whistle.The result was a hysterical
running up and down of the shade which left him utterly bewildered as to
what disposition he was supposed to make of the wobbly bit of humanity
pressed against his shirt front.Reaching over his artificially curved figure to grasp a bit of white
that trailed below his coat, he looked up to see a passing policeman
eyeing him suspiciously."Ye-yes," mumbled Jimmy with affected nonchalence and he knocked the
heels of his boots together in order to keep his teeth from chattering."It's a fi-fine ni-night for air," he stuttered.said the policeman, and to Jimmy's horror, he saw the fellow's
eyes fix themselves on the bit of white."Go-good-night," stammered Jimmy hurriedly, and trying to assume an
easy stride in spite of the uncomfortable addition to his already rotund
figure, he slipped into the hotel, where avoiding the lighted elevator,
he laboured quickly, up the stairs.At the very moment when Zoie was driving Alfred in consternation from
the room, Jimmy entered it uninvited."Get out," was the inhospitable greeting received simultaneously from
Zoie and Aggie, and without waiting for further instructions he "got."Fortunately for all concerned, Alfred, who was at the same moment
departing by way of the bedroom door, did not look behind him; but it
was some minutes before Aggie who had followed Jimmy into the hall could
persuade him to return.After repeated and insistent signals both from Aggie and Zoie, Jimmy's
round red face appeared cautiously around the frame of the door.It bore
unmistakable indications of apoplexy.But the eyes of the women were not
upon Jimmy's face, they too had caught sight of the bit of white that
hung below his coat, and dragging him quickly into the room and closing
the door, Aggie proceeded without inquiry or thanks to unbutton his coat
and to take from beneath it the small object for which she and Zoie had
been eagerly waiting.sighed Zoie, as she saw Aggie bearing the latest
acquisition to Alfred's rapidly increasing family safely toward the
crib.Suddenly remembering something in his right hand coat pocket, Jimmy
called to Aggie, who turned to him and waited expectantly.After
characteristic fumbling, he produced a well filled nursing bottle."For HER," grunted Jimmy, and he nodded toward the bundle in Aggie's
arms.cried Zoie and Aggie in chorus.Zoie shut her lips hard and gazed
at him with contempt."I might have known you'd get the wrong kind," she said.What Jimmy thought about the ingratitude of woman was not to be
expressed in language.He controlled himself as well as he could and
merely LOOKED the things that he would like to have said."Well, it can't be helped now," decided the philosophic Aggie; "here,
Jimmy," she said, "you hold 'HER' a minute and I'll get you the other
one."Placing the small creature in Jimmy's protesting arms, Aggie turned
toward the cradle to make the proposed exchange when she was startled by
the unexpected return of Alfred.Thanks to the ample folds of Jimmy's ulster, he was able to effectually
conceal his charge and he started quickly toward the hall, but in making
the necessary detour around the couch he failed to reach the door before
Alfred, who had chosen a more direct way."Hold on, Jimmy," exclaimed Alfred good-naturedly, and he laid a
detaining hand on his friend's shoulder."I'll be back," stammered Jimmy weakly, edging his way toward the door,
and contriving to keep his back toward Alfred."Wait a minute," said Alfred jovially, as he let his hand slip onto
Jimmy's arm, "you haven't told me the news yet.""I'll tell you later," mumbled Jimmy, still trying to escape.But
Alfred's eye had fallen upon a bit of white flannel dangling below
the bottom of Jimmy's ulster, it travelled upward to Jimmy's unusually
rotund figure.he demanded to know, as he pointed toward the
centre button of Jimmy's overcoat.echoed Jimmy vapidly, glancing at the button in question, "why,
that's just a little----" There was a faint wail from the depths of
the ulster.Jimmy began to caper about with elephantine tread."Oochie,
coochie, oochie," he called excitedly.cried the anxious father, "it's my boy."And with that
he pounced upon Jimmy, threw wide his ulster and snatched from his arms
Jimmy's latest contribution to Zoie's scheme of things.As Aggie had previously remarked, all young babies look very much alike,
and to the inexperienced eye of this new and overwrought father, there
was no difference between the infant that he now pressed to his breast,
and the one that, unsuspected by him, lay peacefully dozing in the crib,
not ten feet from him.He gazed at the face of the newcomer with the
same ecstasy that he had felt in the possession of her predecessor.But
Zoie and Aggie were looking at each other with something quite different
from ecstasy."My boy," exclaimed Alfred, with deep emotion, as he clasped the tiny
creature to his breast."What were you doing
with my baby?""I--I was just taking him out for a little walk!""You just try," threatened Alfred, and he towered over the intimidated
Jimmy.Jimmy was of the opinion that he must be crazy or he would never have
found himself in such a predicament as this, but the anxious faces of
Zoie and Aggie, denied him the luxury of declaring himself so.He sank
mutely on the end of the couch and proceeded to sulk in silence.As for Aggie and Zoie, they continued to gaze open-mouthed at Alfred,
who was waltzing about the room transported into a new heaven of delight
at having snatched his heir from the danger of another night ramble with
Jimmy."Did a horrid old Jimmy spoil his 'itty nap'?"Then
with a sudden exclamation of alarm, he turned toward the anxious women.he cried, as he stared intently into Baby's face.Aggie pretended to glance over Alfred's shoulder."Why so it has," she agreed nervously."It's all right now," counselled Aggie, "so long as it didn't turn in
too suddenly.""We'd better keep him warm, hadn't we?"suggested Alfred, remembering
Aggie's previous instructions on a similar occasion."I'll put him in
his crib," he decided, and thereupon he made a quick move toward the
bassinette.Staggering back from the cradle with the unsteadiness of a drunken man
Alfred called upon the Diety.he demanded as he pointed
toward the unexpected object before him.Neither Zoie, Aggie, nor Jimmy could command words to assist Alfred's
rapidly waning powers of comprehension, and it was not until he had
swept each face for the third time with a look of inquiry that Zoie
found breath to stammer nervously, "Why--why--why, that's the OTHER
one."echoed Alfred in a dazed manner; then he turned to
Aggie for further explanation."Yes," affirmed Aggie, with an emphatic nod, "the other one."An undescribable joy was dawning on Alfred's face."You don't mean----" He stared from the infant in his arms to the one in
the cradle, then back again at Aggie and Zoie.Alfred turned toward
Zoie for the final confirmation of his hopes."Yes, dear," assented Zoie sweetly, "that's Alfred."What Jimmy and the women saw next appeared to be the dance of a whirling
dervish; as a matter of fact, it was merely a man, mad with delight,
clasping two infants in long clothes and circling the room with them.When Alfred could again enunciate distinctly, he rushed to Zoie's side
with the babes in his arms."My darling," he exclaimed, "why didn't you tell me?""I was ashamed," whispered Zoie, hiding her head to shut out the sight
of the red faces pressed close to hers.cried Alfred, struggling to control his complicated
emotions; then gazing at the precious pair in his arms, he cast his eyes
devoutly toward heaven, "Was ever a man so blessed?"Zoie peeped from the covers with affected shyness."I love you TWICE as much," declared Alfred, and with that he sank
exhausted on the foot of the bed, vainly trying to teeter one son on
each knee.CHAPTER XXII

When Jimmy gained courage to turn his eyes in the direction of the
family group he had helped to assemble, he was not reassured by the
reproachful glances that he met from Aggie and Zoie.It was apparent
that in their minds, he was again to blame for something.Realising that
they dared not openly reproach him before Alfred, he decided to make his
escape while his friend was still in the room.He reached for his hat
and tiptoed gingerly toward the door, but just as he was congratulating
himself upon his decision, Alfred called to him with a mysterious air."Jimmy," he said, "just a minute," and he nodded for Jimmy to approach.It must have been Jimmy's guilty conscience that made him powerless
to disobey Alfred's every command.Anyway, he slunk back to the fond
parent's side, where he ultimately allowed himself to be inveigled into
swinging his new watch before the unattentive eyes of the red-faced
babes on Alfred's knees."Lower, Jimmy, lower," called Alfred as Jimmy absent-mindedly allowed
the watch to swing out of the prescribed orbit."Look at the darlings,
Jimmy, look at them," he exclaimed as he gazed at the small creatures
admiringly."Yes, look at them, Jimmy," repeated Zoie, and she glared at Jimmy
behind Alfred's back."Don't you wish you had one of them, Jimmy?'""Well, _I_ wish he had," commented Zoie, and she wondered how she was
ever again to detach either of them from Alfred's breast.Before she could form any plan, the telephone rang loud and
persistently.Jimmy glanced anxiously toward the women for instructions."I'll answer it," said Aggie with suspicious alacrity, and she crossed
quickly toward the 'phone.The scattered bits of conversation that Zoie
was able to gather from Aggie's end of the wire did not tend to soothe
her over-excited nerves.As for Alfred, he was fortunately so engrossed
with the babies that he took little notice of what Aggie was saying."Certainly not," exclaimed Aggie,
"don't let her come up; send her away.Hardy can't see anyone at
all."Then followed a bit of pantomime between Zoie and Aggie, from
which it appeared that their troubles were multiplying, then Aggie again
gave her attention to the 'phone."I don't know anything about her," she
fibbed, "that woman must have the wrong address."And with that she hung
up the receiver and came towards Alfred, anxious to get possession of
his two small charges and to get them from the room, lest the mother who
was apparently downstairs should thrust herself into their midst.asked Alfred, and he nodded toward the
telephone."Oh, just some woman with the wrong address," answered Aggie with
affected carelessness."You'd better let me take the babies now,
Alfred.""To bed," answered Aggie sweetly, "they are going to sleep in the next
room with Jimmy and me."She laid a detaining hand on Jimmy's arm."It's very late," argued Aggie."Of course it is," insisted Zoie."Please, Alfred," she pleaded, "do let
Aggie take them.""Mother knows best," he sighed, but ignoring
Aggie's outstretched arms, he refused to relinquish the joy of himself
carrying the small mites to their room, and he disappeared with the two
of them, singing his now favourite lullaby.When Alfred had left the room, Jimmy, who was now seated comfortably in
the rocker, was rudely startled by a sharp voice at either side of him.shrieked Zoie, with all the disapproval that could be got into
the one small word."You're very clever, aren't you?"sneered Aggie at Jimmy's other elbow."A nice fix you've got me into NOW," reproved Zoie."Why didn't you get out when you had the chance?""You would take your own sweet time, wouldn't you," said Zoie.exclaimed Zoie, and she walked up and down the room
excitedly, oblivious of the disarrangement of her flying negligee."Oh yes," assented Jimmy, as he sank back into the rocker and
began propelling himself to and fro."I never felt better," but a
disinterested observer would have seen in him the picture of discomfort."You're going to feel a great deal WORSE," he was warned by Aggie."Do
you know who that was on the telephone?""She's down stairs," explained Aggie.Jimmy had stopped rocking--his face now wore an uneasy expression."It's time you showed a little human intelligence," taunted Zoie, then
she turned her back upon him and continued to Aggie, "what did she say?""She says," answered Aggie, with a threatening glance toward Jimmy,
"that she won't leave this place until Jimmy gives her baby back.""Let her have her old baby," said Jimmy.snapped Zoie indignantly, "what have YOU got to do
with it?""Oh nothing, nothing," acquiesced Jimmy meekly, "I'm a mere detail.""A lot you care what becomes of me," exclaimed Zoie reproachfully; then
she turned to Aggie with a decided nod."Well, I want it," she asserted."But Zoie," protested Aggie in astonishment, "you can't mean to keep
BOTH of them?""Jimmy has presented Alfred with twins," continued Zoie testily, "and
now, he has to HAVE twins."Jimmy's eyes were growing rounder and rounder."Do you know," continued Zoie, with a growing sense of indignation,
"what would happen to me if I told Alfred NOW that he WASN'T the father
of twins?He'd fly straight out of that door and I'd never see him
again."Aggie admitted that Zoie was no doubt speaking the truth."Jimmy has awakened Alfred's paternal instinct for twins," declared
Zoie, with another emphatic nod of her head, "and now Jimmy must take
the consequences."Jimmy tried to frame a few faint objections, but Zoie waved him aside,
with a positive air.If it were only ONE, it
wouldn't be so bad, but to tell Alfred that he's lost twins, he couldn't
live through it.""But Zoie," argued Aggie, "we can't have that mother hanging around down
stairs until that baby is an old man.She'll have us arrested, the next
thing."asked Zoie, with wide baby eyes.And she nodded toward the now utterly vanquished
Jimmy."That's right," murmured Jimmy, with a weak attempt at sarcasm, "don't
leave me out of anything good.""It doesn't matter WHICH one she arrests," decided the practical Aggie."Well, it matters to me," objected Zoie."And to me too, if it's all the same to you," protested Jimmy."Whoever it is," continued Aggie, "the truth is bound to come out.Alfred will have to know sooner or later, so we might as well make a
clean breast of it, first as last.""That's the first sensible thing you've said in three months," declared
Jimmy with reviving hope.sneered Zoie, and she levelled her most malicious look
at Jimmy."What do you think Alfred would do to YOU, Mr.Jimmy, if he
knew the truth?YOU'RE the one who sent him the telegram; you are the
one who told him that he was a FATHER.""That's true," admitted Aggie, with a wrinkled forehead.Zoie was quick to see her advantage."And Alfred
hasn't any sense of humour, you know."And with that he
sank into his habitual state of dumps."Your sarcasm will do a great deal of good," flashed Zoie.Then she
dismissed him with a nod, and crossed to her dressing table."But Zoie," persisted Aggie, as she followed her young friend in
trepidation, "don't you realise that if you persist in keeping this
baby, that mother will dog Jimmy's footsteps for the rest of his life?""That will be nice," murmured Jimmy.Zoie busied herself with her toilet, and turned a deaf ear to Aggie.There was a touch of genuine emotion in Aggie's voice when she
continued."Just think of it, Zoie, Jimmy will never be able to come and go like a
free man again.""What do I care how he comes and goes?""If
Jimmy had gone when we told him to go, that woman would have had her old
baby by now; but he didn't, oh no!All he ever does is to sit around and
talk about his dinner.""Yes," cried Jimmy hotly, "and that's about as far as I ever GET with
it.""You'll never get anywhere with anything," was Zoie's exasperating
answer."Well, there's nothing slow about you," retorted Jimmy, stung to a
frenzy by her insolence."Oh please, please," interposed Aggie, desperately determined to keep
these two irascible persons to the main issue."What are we going to
tell that mother?""You can tell her whatever you like," answered Zoie, with an impudent
toss of her head, "but I'll NOT give up that baby until I get ANOTHER
one.'It was apparent that he must needs
increase the number of his brain cells if he were to follow this
extraordinary young woman's line of thought much further."You don't
expect to go on multiplying them forever, do you?""YOU are the one who has been multiplying them," was Zoie's
disconcerting reply.It was evident to Jimmy that he could not think fast enough nor clearly
enough to save himself from a mental disaster if he continued to argue
with the shameless young woman, so he contented himself by rocking to
and fro and murmuring dismally that he had "known from the first that it
was to be an endless chain."While Zoie and Jimmy had been wrangling, Aggie had been weighing the
pros and cons of the case.She now turned to Jimmy with a tone of firm
but motherly decision."Zoie is quite right," she said.Jimmy rolled his large eyes up at his spouse with a "you too, Brutus,"
expression.Aggie continued mercilessly, "It's the only way, Jimmy."No sooner had Aggie arrived at her decision than Zoie upset her
tranquillity by a triumphant expression of "I have it."Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Zoie's radiant face in consternation.They were
accustomed to see only reproach there.Her sudden enthusiasm increased
Jimmy's uneasiness."YOU have it," he grunted without attempting to conceal his disgust."SHE'S the one who generally has it."Inflamed by her young friend's enthusiasm, Aggie rushed to her eagerly.exclaimed Zoie, as though the revelation had come
straight from heaven."SHE HAD TWINS," and with that, two pairs of eyes
turned expectantly toward the only man in the room.Tracing the pattern of the rug with his toe, Jimmy remained stubbornly
oblivious of their attentions.He rearranged the pillows on the couch,
and finally, for want of a better occupation, he wound his watch.He could feel Zoie's cat-like gaze upon him."Jimmy can get the other one," she said."The hell I can," exclaimed Jimmy, starting to his feet and no longer
considering time or place.The two women gazed at him reproachfully.cried Aggie, in a shocked, hurt voice."That's the first time
I've ever heard you swear.""Well, it won't be the LAST time," declared Jimmy hotly, "if THIS keeps
up."He paced to and fro like an infuriated lion."Dearest," said Aggie, "you look almost imposing.""Nonsense," interrupted Zoie, who found Jimmy unusually ridiculous."If
I'd known that Jimmy was going to put such an idea into Alfred's head,
I'd have got the two in the first place.""Of course she will," answered Zoie, leaving Jimmy entirely out of
the conversation."She's as poor as a church mouse.What could she do with one twin, anyway?"A snort of rage from Jimmy did not disturb Zoie's enthusiasm.She
proceeded to elaborate her plan."I'll adopt them," she declared, "I'll leave them all Alfred's money.Think of Alfred having real live twins for keeps.""It would be nice, wouldn't it?"Zoie turned to Jimmy, as though they were on the best of terms.Before Jimmy could declare himself penniless, Aggie answered for him
with the greatest enthusiasm, "He has a whole lot; he drew some today."exclaimed Zoie to the abashed Jimmy, and then she continued in a
matter-of-fact tone, "Now, Jimmy," she said, "you go give the washwoman
what money you have on account, then tell her to come around here in the
morning when Alfred has gone out and I'll settle all the details with
her.Go on now, Jimmy," she continued, "you don't need another letter.""No," chimed in Aggie sweetly; "you know her now, dear.""Oh, yes," corroborated Jimmy, with a sarcastic smile and without
budging from the spot on which he stood, "we are great pals now."asked Zoie, astonished that Jimmy was not starting
on his mission with alacrity."You know what happened the last time you hesitated," warned Aggie."I know what happened when I DIDN'T hesitate," ruminated Jimmy, still
holding his ground.Zoie's eyes were wide with surprise."You don't mean to say," she
exclaimed incredulously, "that you aren't GOING--after we have thought
all this out just to SAVE you?""Say," answered Jimmy, with a confidential air, "do me a favour, will
you?"But, Jimmy----" protested both women simultaneously; but before they
could get further Alfred's distressed voice reached them from the next
room.CHAPTER XVIII

What seemed to be a streak of pink through the room was in reality Zoie
bolting for the bed.While Zoie hastened to snuggle comfortably under the covers, Aggie tried
without avail to get Jimmy started on his errand.Getting no response from Aggie, Alfred, bearing one infant in his arms,
came in search of her.Apparently he was having difficulty with the
unfastening of baby's collar."Aggie," he called sharply, "how on earth do you get this fool pin out?""Take him back, Alfred," answered Aggie impatiently; "I'll be there in a
minute."But Alfred had apparently made up his mind that he was not a success as
a nurse."You'd better take him now, Aggie," he decided, as he offered the small
person to the reluctant Aggie."I'll stay here and talk to Jimmy.""Oh, but Jimmy was just going out," answered Aggie; then she turned to
her obdurate spouse with mock sweetness, "Weren't you, dear?""Yes," affirmed Zoie, with a threatening glance toward Jimmy."Just for a little air," explained Aggie blandly."Yes," growled Jimmy, "another little heir.""He had air a while ago with my
son.He is going to stay here and tell me the news.Sit down, Jimmy,"
he commanded, and to the intense annoyance of Aggie and Zoie, Jimmy sank
resignedly on the couch.Alfred was about to seat himself beside his friend, when the 'phone rang
violently.Being nearest to the instrument, Alfred reached it first and
Zoie and Aggie awaited the consequences in dread.What they heard did
not reassure them nor Jimmy.Jimmy began to wriggle with a vague uneasiness."Well," continued Alfred at the 'phone, "that woman has the wrong
number."Then with a peremptory "Wait a minute," he turned to Zoie, "The
hall boy says that woman who called a while ago is still down stairs and
she won't go away until she has seen you, Zoie.She has some kind of an
idiotic idea that you know where her baby is.""Well," decided Alfred, "I'd better go down stairs and see what's
the matter with her," and he turned toward the door to carry out his
intention.She was half out of bed in her anxiety.'Phone down to the boy to send her away."Oh," said Alfred, "then she's been here before?answered Zoie, trying to gain time for a new inspiration."Why, she's--she's----" her face lit up with satisfaction--the idea had
arrived."She's the nurse," she concluded emphatically."Yes," answered Zoie, pretending to be annoyed with his dull memory."She's the one I told you about, the one I had to discharge.""Oh," said Alfred, with the relief of sudden comprehension; "the crazy
one?"Aggie and Zoie nodded their heads and smiled at him tolerantly, then
Zoie continued to elaborate."You see," she said, "the poor creature was
so insane about little Jimmy that I couldn't go near the child.""I'll soon tell the boy what
to do with her," he declared, and he rushed to the 'phone.Barely had
Alfred taken the receiver from the hook when the outer door was heard
to bang.Before he could speak a distracted young woman, whose excitable
manner bespoke her foreign origin, swept through the door without seeing
him and hurled herself at the unsuspecting Zoie.The woman's black hair
was dishevelled, and her large shawl had fallen from her shoulders.To
Jimmy, who was crouching behind an armchair, she seemed a giantess.cried the frenzied mother, with what was unmistakably an
Italian accent.There was no answer; her eyes sought
the cradle.she shrieked, then upon finding the cradle empty, she
redoubled her lamentations and again she bore down upon the terrified
Zoie."You," she cried, "you know where my baby is!"For answer, Zoie sank back amongst her pillows and drew the bed covers
completely over her head.Alfred approached the bed to protect his young
wife; the Italian woman wheeled about and perceived a small child in his
arms."I knew it," she cried; "I knew it!"Managing to disengage himself from what he considered a mad woman, and
elevating one elbow between her and the child, Alfred prevented the
mother from snatching the small creature from his arms."Calm yourself, madam," he commanded with a superior air."We are very
sorry for you, of course, but we can't have you coming here and going on
like this.He's OUR baby and----"

"He's NOT your baby!"cried the infuriated mother; "he's MY baby.Give him to me," and with that she sprang upon the
uncomfortable Alfred like a tigress.Throwing her whole weight on his
uplifted elbow, she managed to pull down his arm until she could look
into the face of the washerwoman's promising young offspring.The air
was rent by a scream that made each individual hair of Jimmy's head
stand up in its own defence.He could feel a sickly sensation at the top
of his short thick neck."He's NOT my baby," wailed the now demented mother, little dreaming that
the infant for which she was searching was now reposing comfortably on a
soft pillow in the adjoining room.As for Alfred, all of this was merely confirmation of Zoie's statement
that this poor soul was crazy, and he was tempted to dismiss her with
worthy forbearance."I am glad, madam," he said, "that you are coming to your senses."Now, all would have gone well and the bewildered mother would no doubt
have left the room convinced of her mistake, had not Jimmy's nerves got
the better of his judgment.Having slipped cautiously from his position
behind the armchair he was tiptoeing toward the door, and was flattering
himself on his escape, when suddenly, as his forward foot cautiously
touched the threshold, he heard the cry of the captor in his wake, and
before he could possibly command the action of his other foot, he felt
himself being forcibly drawn backward by what appeared to be his too
tenacious coat-tails."If only they would tear," thought Jimmy, but thanks to the excellence
of the tailor that Aggie had selected for him, they did NOT "tear."Not until she had anchored Jimmy safely to the centre of the rug did the
irate mother pour out the full venom of her resentment toward him.From
the mixture of English and Italian that followed, it was apparent that
she was accusing Jimmy of having stolen her baby."Take me to him," she demanded tragically; "my baby--take me to him!""Humour her," whispered Alfred, much elated by the evidence of his
own self-control as compared to Jimmy's utter demoralisation under the
apparently same circumstances.Alfred was becoming vexed; he pointed first to his own forehead, then
to that of Jimmy's hysterical captor.He even illustrated his meaning
by making a rotary motion with his forefinger, intended to remind Jimmy
that the woman was a lunatic.Still Jimmy only stared at him and all the while the woman was becoming
more and more emphatic in her declaration that Jimmy knew where her baby
was."Sure, Jimmy," said Alfred, out of all patience with Jimmy's stupidity
and tiring of the strain of the woman's presence.cried the mother, and she towered over Jimmy with a wild light in
her eyes."Take me to him," she demanded; "take me to him."Jimmy rolled his large eyes first toward Aggie, then toward Zoie and at
last toward Alfred."Take her to him, Jimmy," commanded a concert of voices; and pursued by
a bundle of waving colours and a medley of discordant sounds, Jimmy shot
from the room.CHAPTER XXIV

The departure of Jimmy and the crazed mother was the occasion for a
general relaxing among the remaining occupants of the room.Exhausted
by what had passed Zoie had ceased to interest herself in the future.It
was enough for the present that she could sink back upon her pillows and
draw a long breath without an evil face bending over her, and without
the air being rent by screams.As for Aggie, she fell back upon the window seat and closed her eyes.The horrors into which Jimmy might be rushing had not yet presented
themselves to her imagination.Of the three, Alfred was the only one who had apparently received
exhilaration from the encounter.He was strutting about the room with
the babe in his arms, undoubtedly enjoying the sensations of a hero.When he could sufficiently control his feeling of elation, he looked
down at the small person with an air of condescension and again lent
himself to the garbled sort of language with which defenceless infants
are inevitably persecuted."Tink of dat horrid old woman wanting to steal our own little oppsie,
woppsie, toppsie babykins," he said.Then he turned to Zoie with an
air of great decision."That woman ought to be locked up," he declared,
"she's dangerous," and with that he crossed to Aggie and hurriedly
placed the infant in her unsuspecting arms."Here, Aggie," he said, "you
take Alfred and get him into bed."Glad of an excuse to escape to the next room and recover her self
control, Aggie quickly disappeared with the child.For some moments Alfred continued to pace up and down the room; then he
came to a full stop before Zoie."I'll have to have something done to that woman," he declared
emphatically."Jimmy will do enough to her," sighed Zoie, weakly."She's no business to be at large," continued Alfred; then, with a
business-like air, he started toward the telephone.He was now calling into the 'phone, "Give me
information."demanded Zoie, more and more disturbed by
his mysterious manner."One can't be too careful," retorted Alfred in his most paternal
fashion; "there's an awful lot of kidnapping going on these days.""Well, you don't suspect information, do you?"Again Alfred ignored her; he was intent upon things of more importance."Hello," he called into the 'phone, "is this information?"Apparently it
was for he continued, with a satisfied air, "Well, give me the Fullerton
Street Police Station."cried Zoie, sitting up in bed and looking about the room
with a new sense of alarm.shrieked the over-wrought young wife."Now, now, dear, don't get nervous,"
he said, "I am only taking the necessary precautions."And again he
turned to the 'phone.Alarmed by Zoie's summons, Aggie entered the room hastily.She was not
reassured upon hearing Alfred's further conversation at the 'phone."Is this the Fullerton Street Police Station?"echoed Aggie, and her eyes sought Zoie's inquiringly.called Alfred over his shoulder to the excited Aggie, then
he continued into the 'phone.Well, hello, Donneghey, this is your
old friend Hardy, Alfred Hardy at the Sherwood.I've just got back,"
then he broke the happy news to the no doubt appreciative Donneghey.he said, "I'm a happy father."Zoie puckered her small face in disgust.Alfred continued to elucidate joyfully at the 'phone."Doubles," he said, "yes--sure--on the level.""I don't know why you have to tell the whole neighbourhood," snapped
Zoie.But Alfred was now in the full glow of his genial account to his friend.he repeated in answer to an evident suggestion from the
other end of the line, "I should say I would.Tell
the boys I'll be right over.And say, Donneghey," he added, in a more
confidential tone, "I want to bring one of the men home with me.I
want him to keep an eye on the house to-night"; then after a pause, he
concluded confidentially, "I'll tell you all about it when I get there.It looks like a kidnapping scheme to me," and with that he hung up the
receiver, unmistakably pleased with himself, and turned his beaming face
toward Zoie."It's all right, dear," he said, rubbing his hands together with evident
satisfaction, "Donneghey is going to let us have a Special Officer to
watch the house to-night.""I won't HAVE a special officer," declared Zoie vehemently; then
becoming aware of Alfred's great surprise, she explained half-tearfully,
"I'm not going to have the police hanging around our very door.I would
feel as though I were in prison.""You ARE in prison, my dear," returned the now irrepressible Alfred."A
prison of love--you and our precious boys."He stooped and implanted a
gracious kiss on her forehead, then turned toward the table for his hat."Now," he said, "I'll just run around the corner, set up the drinks for
the boys, and bring the officer home with me," and drawing himself up
proudly, he cried gaily in parting, "I'll bet there's not another man in
Chicago who has what I have to-night.""I hope not," groaned Zoie.Then,
thrusting her two small feet from beneath the coverlet and perching on
the side of the bed, she declared to Aggie that "Alfred was getting more
idiotic every minute.""He's worse than idiotic," corrected Aggie.If
he gets the police around here before we give that baby back, they'll
get the mother.She'll tell all she knows and that will be the end of
Jimmy!"exclaimed Zoie, "it'll be the end of ALL of us.""I can see our pictures in the papers, right now," groaned Aggie."Jimmy IS a villain," declared Zoie.How am I ever going to get that other twin?""There is only one thing to do," decided Aggie, "I must go for it
myself."And she snatched up her cape from the couch and started toward
the door.cried Zoie, in alarm, "and leave me alone?""It's our only chance," argued Aggie."I'll have to do it now, before
Alfred gets back.""But Aggie," protested Zoie, clinging to her departing friend, "suppose
that crazy mother should come back?""Nonsense," replied Aggie, and before Zoie could actually realise what
was happening the bang of the outside door told her that she was alone.CHAPTER XXV

Wondering what new terrors awaited her, Zoie glanced uncertainly from
door to door.So strong had become her habit of taking refuge in the
bed, that unconsciously she backed toward it now.Barely had she reached
the centre of the room when a terrific crash of breaking glass from the
adjoining room sent her shrieking in terror over the footboard, and head
first under the covers.Here she would doubtless have remained until
suffocated, had not Jimmy in his backward flight from one of the
inner rooms overturned a large rocker.This additional shock to Zoie's
overstrung nerves forced a wild scream from her lips, and an answering
exclamation from the nerve-racked Jimmy made her sit bolt upright.She
gazed at him in astonishment.His tie was awry, one end of his collar
had taken leave of its anchorage beneath his stout chin, and was now
just tickling the edge of his red, perspiring brow.His hair was on end
and his feelings were undeniably ruffled.As usual Zoie's greeting did
not tend to conciliate him."The fire-escape," panted Jimmy and he nodded mysteriously toward the
inner rooms of the apartment.There was only one and that led through the
bathroom window.He was now peeping cautiously out of the
window toward the pavement below.Jimmy jerked his thumb in the direction of the street.Zoie gazed at him
with grave apprehension.Jimmy shook his head and continued to peer cautiously out of the window."What did _I_ do with her?"repeated Jimmy, a flash of his old
resentment returning.For the first time, Zoie became fully conscious of Jimmy's ludicrous
appearance.Her overstrained nerves gave way and she began to laugh
hysterically."Say," shouted Jimmy, towering over the bed and devoutly wishing that
she were his wife so that he might strike her with impunity."Don't you
sic any more lunatics onto me."It is doubtful whether Zoie's continued laughter might not have provoked
Jimmy to desperate measures, had not the 'phone at that moment directed
their thoughts toward worse possibilities.After the instrument had
continued to ring persistently for what seemed to Zoie an age, she
motioned to Jimmy to answer it.He responded by retreating to the other
side of the room."It may be Aggie," suggested Zoie.For the first time, Jimmy became aware that Aggie was nowhere in the
apartment.he exclaimed, as he realised that he was again tete-a-tete
with the terror of his dreams."Gone to do what YOU should have done," was Zoie's characteristic
answer."Well," answered Jimmy hotly, "it's about time that somebody besides me
did something around this place.""YOU," mocked Zoie, "all YOU'VE ever done was to hoodoo me from the very
beginning.""If you'd taken my advice," answered Jimmy, "and told your husband the
truth about the luncheon, there'd never have been any 'beginning.'""If, if, if," cried Zoie, in an agony of impatience, "if you'd tipped
that horrid old waiter enough, he'd never have told anyway.""I'm not buying waiters to cover up your crimes," announced Jimmy with
his most self-righteous air."You'll be buying more than that to cover up your OWN crimes before
you've finished," retorted Zoie."Before I've finished with YOU, yes," agreed Jimmy.He wheeled upon her
with increasing resentment."Do you know where I expect to end up?""I know where you OUGHT to end up," snapped Zoie."I'll finish in the electric chair," said Jimmy."I can feel blue
lightning chasing up and down my spine right now.""Well, I wish you HAD finished in the electric chair," declared Zoie,
"before you ever dragged me into that awful old restaurant."answered Jimmy shaking his fist at her across the
foot of the bed.For the want of adequate words to express his further
feelings, Jimmy was beginning to jibber, when the outer door was
heard to close, and he turned to behold Aggie entering hurriedly with
something partly concealed by her long cape."It's all right," explained Aggie triumphantly to Zoie.She threw her cape aside and disclosed the fruits of her conquest."So," snorted Jimmy in disgust, slightly miffed by the apparent ease
with which Aggie had accomplished a task about which he had made so much
ado, "you've gone into the business too, have you?"She continued in a businesslike tone to
Zoie."Thank Heaven," sighed Aggie, then she turned to Jimmy and addressed him
in rapid, decided tones."Now, dear," she said, "I'll just put the new
baby to bed, then I'll give you the other one and you can take it right
down to the mother."Jimmy made a vain start in the direction of the fire-escape.Four
detaining hands were laid upon him."Don't try anything like that," warned Aggie; "you can't get out of this
house without that baby.And Aggie sailed triumphantly out of the room to
make the proposed exchange of babies.Before Jimmy was able to suggest to himself an escape from Aggie's last
plan of action, the telephone again began to cry for attention.Neither Jimmy nor Zoie could summon courage to approach the impatient
instrument, and as usual Zoie cried frantically for Aggie.Aggie was not long in returning to the room and this time she bore in
her arms the infant so strenuously demanded by its mad mother."Here you are, Jimmy," she said; "here's the other one.Now take him
down stairs quickly before Alfred gets back."She attempted to place the
unresisting babe in Jimmy's chubby arms, but Jimmy's freedom was not to
be so easily disposed of.he exclaimed, backing away from the small creature in fear and
abhorrence, "take that bundle of rags down to the hotel office and have
that woman hystericing all over me."Oh well," answered Aggie, distracted by the persistent ringing of the
'phone, "then hold him a minute until I answer the 'phone."This at least was a compromise, and reluctantly Jimmy allowed the now
wailing infant to be placed in his arms."Jig it, Jimmy, jig it," cried Zoie.Jimmy looked down helplessly at
the baby's angry red face, but before he had made much headway with the
"jigging," Aggie returned to them, much excited by the message which she
had just received over the telephone."That mother is making a scene down stairs in the office," she said."You hear," chided Zoie, in a fury at Jimmy, "what did Aggie tell you?""If she wants this thing," maintained Jimmy, looking down at the bundle
in his arms, "she can come after it.""We can't have her up here," objected Aggie."Alfred may be back at any minute.You know what
happened the last time we tried to change them.""You can send it down the chimney, for all I care," concluded Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, her face suddenly illumined."Oh Lord," groaned Jimmy, who had come to regard any elation on Zoie's
or Aggie's part as a sure forewarner of ultimate discomfort for him.Again Aggie had recourse to the 'phone."Hello," she called to the office boy, "tell that woman to go around to
the back door, and we'll send something down to her."There was a slight
pause, then Aggie added sweetly, "Yes, tell her to wait at the foot of
the fire-escape."Zoie had already caught the drift of Aggie's intention and she now fixed
her glittering eyes upon Jimmy, who was already shifting about uneasily
and glancing at Aggie, who approached him with a business-like air."Now, dear," said Aggie, "come with me.I'll hand Baby out through the
bathroom window and you can run right down the fire-escape with him.""If I do run down the fire-escape," exclaimed Jimmy, wagging his large
head from side to side, "I'll keep right on RUNNING.That's the last
you'll ever see of me.""But, Jimmy," protested Aggie, slightly hurt by his threat, "once that
woman gets her baby you'll have no more trouble."asked Jimmy, looking from one to the other."She'll be up here if you don't hurry," urged Aggie impatiently, and
with that she pulled Jimmy toward the bedroom door."Let her come," said Jimmy, planting his feet so as to resist Aggie's
repeated tugs, "I'm going to South America.""Why will you act like this," cried Aggie, in utter desperation, "when
we have so little time?""Say," said Jimmy irrelevantly, "do you know that I haven't had any----"

"Yes," interrupted Aggie and Zoie in chorus, "we know.""How long," continued Zoie impatiently, "is it going to take you to slip
down that fire-escape?""That depends on how fast I'slip,'" answered Jimmy doggedly."You'll'slip' all right," sneered Zoie.Further exchange of pleasantries between these two antagonists was cut
short by the banging of the outside door.exclaimed Aggie, glancing nervously over her shoulder,
"there's Alfred now.Hurry, Jimmy, hurry," she cried, and with that she
fairly forced Jimmy out through the bedroom door, and followed in his
wake to see him safely down the fire-escape.CHAPTER XXVI

Zoie had barely time to arrange herself after the manner of an
interesting invalid, when Alfred entered the room in the gayest of
spirits."Hello, dearie," he cried as he crossed quickly to her side.asked Zoie faintly and she glanced uneasily toward the door,
through which Jimmy and Aggie had just disappeared."I told you I shouldn't be long," said Alfred jovially, and he implanted
a condescending kiss on her forehead.he
asked, rubbing his hands together in satisfaction."You're all cold," pouted Zoie, edging away, "and you've been drinking.""I had to have one or two with the boys," said Alfred, throwing out his
chest and strutting about the room, "but never again.From now on I cut
out all drinks and cigars.This is where I begin to live my life for our
sons."asked Zoie, as she began to see long years
of boredom stretching before her."You and our boys are one and the same, dear," answered Alfred, coming
back to her side."You mean you couldn't go on loving ME if it weren't for the BOYS?"She was beginning to realise how completely
her hold upon him depended upon her hideous deception."Of course I could, Zoie," answered Alfred, flattered by what he
considered her desire for his complete devotion, "but----"

"But not so MUCH," pouted Zoie."Well, of course, dear," admitted Alfred evasively, as he sank down upon
the edge of the bed by her side--

"You needn't say another word," interrupted Zoie, and then with a shade
of genuine repentance, she declared shame-facedly that she hadn't been
"much of a wife" to Alfred.contradicted the proud young father, "you've given me the
ONE thing that I wanted most in the world.""But you see, dear," said Zoie, as she wound her little white arms about
his neck, and looked up into his face adoringly, "YOU'VE been the 'ONE'
thing that I wanted 'MOST' and I never realised until to-night how--how
crazy you are about things.""Well," said Zoie, letting her eyes fall before his and picking at a bit
of imaginary lint on the coverlet, "babies and things.""Oh," said Alfred, and he was about to proceed when she again
interrupted him."But now that I DO realise it," continued Zoie, earnestly, her fingers
on his lips, lest he again interrupt, "if you'll only have a little
patience with me, I'll--I'll----" again her eyes fell bashfully to the
coverlet, as she considered the possibility of being ultimately obliged
to replace the bogus twins with real ones."All the patience in the world," answered Alfred, little dreaming of the
problem that confronted the contrite Zoie."That's all I ask," declared Zoie, her assurance completely restored,
"and in case anything SHOULD happen to THESE----" she glanced anxiously
toward the door through which Aggie had borne the twins."But nothing is going to happen to these, dear," interrupted Alfred,
rising and again assuming an air of fatherly protection.There, there," he added, patting her small shoulder and nodding
his head wisely."That crazy woman has got on your nerves, but you
needn't worry, I've got everything fixed.Donneghey sent a special
officer over with me.shrieked Zoie, fixing her eyes on the bedroom door, through which
Jimmy had lately disappeared and wondering whether he had yet "slipped"
down the fire-escape."Yes," continued Alfred, walking up and down the floor with a masterly
stride."If that woman is caught hanging around here again, she'll get a
little surprise.My boys are safe now, God bless them!"Then reminded of
the fact that he had not seen them since his return, he started quickly
toward the bedroom door."I'll just have a look at the little rascals,"
he decided.She caught Alfred's arm as he passed the side of
her bed, and clung to him in desperation.Alfred looked down at her in surprise.She turned her face toward the door, and called lustily, "Aggie!questioned Alfred, thinking Zoie suddenly ill, "can
I get you something?"Before Zoie was obliged to reply, Aggie answered her summons.she asked, glancing inquiringly into Zoie's distressed
face."Alfred's here," said Zoie, with a sickly smile as she stroked his hand
and glanced meaningly at Aggie.cried Aggie, and involuntarily she took a step backward,
as though to guard the bedroom door."Yes," said Alfred, mistaking Aggie's surprise for a compliment to his
resource; "and now, Aggie, if you'll just stay with Zoie for a minute
I'll have a look at my boys."exclaimed Aggie, nervously, and she placed herself again in
front of the bedroom door.Alfred was plainly annoyed by her proprietory air."I'll not WAKE them," persisted Alfred, "I just wish to have a LOOK at
them," and with that he again made a move toward the door."But Alfred," protested Zoie, still clinging to his hand, "you're not
going to leave me again--so soon."Alfred was becoming more and more restive under the seeming absurdity of
their persistent opposition, but before he could think of a polite way
of over-ruling them, Aggie continued persuasively."You stay with Zoie," she said."I'll bring the boys in here and you can
both have a look at them.""But Aggie," argued Alfred, puzzled by her illogical behaviour, "would
it be wise to wake them?""Now you stay here and I'll get them."Before Alfred could protest further she was out of the room and the door
had closed behind her, so he resigned himself to her decision, banished
his temporary annoyance at her obstinacy, and glanced about the room
with a new air of proprietorship."This is certainly a great night, Zoie," he said."It certainly is," acquiesced Zoie, with an over emphasis that made
Alfred turn to her with new concern."I'm afraid that mad woman made you very nervous, dear," he said.Zoie's nerves were destined to bear still further strain, for at that
moment, there came a sharp ring at the door.Beside herself with anxiety Zoie threw her arms about Alfred, who had
advanced to soothe her, drew him down by her side and buried her head on
his breast."You ARE jumpy," said Alfred, and at that instant a wrangle of loud
voices, and a general commotion was heard in the outer hall.asked Alfred, endeavouring to disentangle himself from Zoie's
frantic embrace.Zoie clung to him so tightly that he was unable to rise, but his alert
ear caught the sound of a familiar voice rising above the din of dispute
in the hallway."That sounds like the officer," he exclaimed.cried Zoie, and she wound her arms more tightly about
him.CHAPTER XXVII

Propelled by a large red fist, attached to the back of his badly wilted
collar, the writhing form of Jimmy was now thrust through the outer
door."Let go of me," shouted the hapless Jimmy.The answer was a spasmodic shaking administered by the fist; then a
large burly officer, carrying a small babe in his arms, shoved the
reluctant Jimmy into the centre of the room and stood guard over him."I got him for you, sir," announced the officer proudly, to the
astonished Alfred, who had just managed to untwine Zoie's arms and to
struggle to his feet.Alfred's eyes fell first upon the dejected Jimmy, then they travelled to
the bundle of long clothes in the officer's arms.He snatched the infant from the officer
and pressed him jealously to his breast."I don't understand," he said,
gazing at the officer in stupefaction.asked the officer, nodding toward the unfortunate
Jimmy."I caught him slipping down your fire-escape.""I KNEW it," exclaimed Zoie in a rage, and she cast a vindictive look at
Jimmy for his awkwardness.Alfred
turned again to the officer, then to Jimmy, who was still flashing
defiance into the officer's threatening eyes.What's the matter with you,
Jimmy?This is the third time that you have tried to take my baby out
into the night.""Then you've had trouble with him before?"He
studied Jimmy with new interest, proud in the belief that he had brought
a confirmed "baby-snatcher" to justice."I've had a little trouble myself," declared Jimmy hotly, now resolved
to make a clean breast of it."I'm not asking about your troubles," interrupted the officer savagely,
and Jimmy felt the huge creature's obnoxious fingers tightening again on
his collar."Go ahead, sir," said the officer to Alfred."Well," began Alfred, nodding toward the now livid Jimmy, "he was out
with my boy when I arrived.I stopped him from going out with him
a second time, and now you, officer, catch him slipping down the
fire-escape.I don't know what to say," he finished weakly."_I_ do," exclaimed Jimmy, feeling more and more like a high explosive,
"and I'll say it."And before Jimmy could get further,
Alfred resumed with fresh vehemence."He's supposed to be a friend of mine," he explained to the officer, as
he nodded toward the wriggling Jimmy."He was all right when I left him
a few months ago.""You'll think I'm all right again," shouted Jimmy, trying to get free
from the officer, "before I've finished telling all I----"

"That won't help any," interrupted the officer firmly, and with another
twist of Jimmy's badly wilted collar he turned to Alfred with his most
civil manner, "What shall I do with him, sir?""I don't know," said Alfred, convinced that his friend was a fit subject
for a straight jacket."It's absurd," cried Zoie, on the verge of hysterics, and in utter
despair of ever disentangling the present complication without
ultimately losing Alfred, "you're all absurd," she cried wildly.exclaimed Alfred, turning upon her in amazement, "what do you
mean?""It's a joke," said Zoie, without the slightest idea of where the joke
lay."If you had any sense you could see it.""I DON'T see it," said Alfred, with hurt dignity."Neither do I," said Jimmy, with boiling resentment."Can you call it a joke," asked Alfred, incredulously, "to have our
boy----" He stopped suddenly, remembering that there was a companion
piece to this youngster.he exclaimed, "our other
boy----" He rushed to the crib, found it empty, and turned a terrified
face to Zoie."Now, Alfred," pleaded Zoie, "don't get excited; he's all right."Zoie did not know, but at that moment her eyes fell upon Jimmy, and as
usual he was the source of an inspiration for her."Jimmy never cared for the other one," she said, "did you, Jimmy?"Alfred turned to the officer, with a tone of command."Wait," he said,
then he started toward the bedroom door to make sure that his other
boy was quite safe.The picture that confronted him brought the hair
straight up on his head.True to her promise, and ignorant of Jimmy's
return with the first baby, Aggie had chosen this ill-fated moment to
appear on the threshold with one babe on each arm."Here they are," she said graciously, then stopped in amazement at sight
of the horrified Alfred, clasping a third infant to his breast.exclaimed Alfred, stroking his forehead with his unoccupied
hand, and gazing at what he firmly believed must be an apparition,
"THOSE aren't MINE," he pointed to the two red mites in Aggie's arms.stammered Aggie for the want of something better
to say.Then he turned in appeal to his young wife,
whose face had now become utterly expressionless.There was an instant's pause, then the blood returned to Zoie's face and
she proved herself the artist that Alfred had once declared her."OURS, dear," she murmured softly, with a bashful droop of her lids.persisted Alfred, pointing to the baby in his arms, and
feeling sure that his mind was about to give way."Why--why--why," stuttered Zoie, "THAT'S the JOKE."echoed Alfred, looking as though he found it anything but
such."Yes," added Aggie, sharing Zoie's desperation to get out of their
temporary difficulty, no matter at what cost in the future.stammered Alfred, "what IS there to tell?""Why, you see," said Aggie, growing more enthusiastic with each
elaboration of Zoie's lie, "we didn't dare to break it to you too
suddenly."gasped Alfred; a new light was beginning to dawn on
his face."So," concluded Zoie, now thoroughly at home in the new situation, "we
asked Jimmy to take THAT one OUT."Jimmy cast an inscrutable glance in Zoie's direction.Was it possible
that she was at last assisting him out of a difficulty?"Yes," confirmed Aggie, with easy confidence, "we wanted you to get used
to the idea gradually."He was afraid to allow his mind to accept
too suddenly the whole significance of their disclosure, lest his joy
over-power him."You--you--do--don't mean----" he stuttered."Yes, dear," sighed Zoie, with the face of an angel, and then with a
languid sigh, she sank back contentedly on her pillows.cried Alfred, now delirious with delight."Give
them to me," he called to Aggie, and he snatched the surprised infants
savagely from her arms."Give me ALL of them, ALL of them."He clasped
the three babes to his breast, then dashed to the bedside of the
unsuspecting Zoie and covered her small face with rapturous kisses.Feeling the red faces of the little strangers in such close proximity to
hers, Zoie drew away from them with abhorrence, but unconscious of her
unmotherly action, Alfred continued his mad career about the room, his
heart overflowing with gratitude toward Zoie in particular and mankind
in general.Finding Aggie in the path of his wild jubilee, he treated
that bewildered young matron to an unwelcome kiss.A proceeding which
Jimmy did not at all approve.Hardly had Aggie recovered from her surprise when the disgruntled
Jimmy was startled out of his dark mood by the supreme insult of a
loud resounding kiss implanted on his own cheek by his excitable young
friend.Jimmy raised his arm to resist a second assault, and Alfred
veered off in the direction of the officer, who stepped aside just in
time to avoid similar demonstration from the indiscriminating young
father.Finding a wide circle prescribed about himself and the babies, Alfred
suddenly stopped and gazed about from one astonished face to the other."Well," said the officer, regarding Alfred with an injured air,
and feeling much downcast at being so ignominiously deprived of his
short-lived heroism in capturing a supposed criminal, "if this is all a
joke, I'll let the woman go.""The woman," repeated Alfred; "what woman?""I nabbed a woman at the foot of the fire-escape," explained the
officer.Zoie and Aggie glanced at each other inquiringly."I thought
she might be an accomplice."His manner was
becoming more paternal, not to say condescending, with the arrival of
each new infant."Don't be silly, Alfred," snapped Zoie, really ashamed that Alfred was
making such an idiot of himself."Oh, that's it," said Alfred, with a wise nod of comprehension; "the
nurse, then she's in the joke too?""You're all in it," he exclaimed, flattered to think
that they had considered it necessary to combine the efforts of so many
of them to deceive him."Yes," assented Jimmy sadly, "we are all 'in it.'""Well, she's a great actress," decided Alfred, with the air of a
connoisseur."She sure is," admitted Donneghey, more and more disgruntled as he felt
his reputation for detecting fraud slipping from him."She put up a
phoney story about the kid being hers," he added."But I could tell she
wasn't on the level.Good-night, sir," he called to Alfred, and ignoring
Jimmy, he passed quickly from the room."Oh, officer," Alfred called after him.I'll
be down later and fix things up with you."Again Alfred gave his whole
attention to his new-found family.He leaned over the cradle and gazed
ecstatically into the three small faces below his."This is too much,"
he murmured."Much too much," agreed Jimmy, who was now sitting hunched up on the
couch in his customary attitude of gloom."You were right not to break it to me too suddenly," said Alfred, and
with his arms encircling three infants he settled himself on the couch
by Jimmy's side."You're a cute one," he continued to Jimmy, who was
edging away from the three mites with aversion.In the absence of any
answer from Jimmy, Alfred appealed to Zoie, "Isn't he a cute one, dear?""Oh, yes, VERY," answered Zoie, sarcastically.Shutting his lips tight and glancing at Zoie with a determined effort at
self restraint, Jimmy rose from the couch and started toward the door."If you women are done with me," he said, "I'll clear out."exclaimed Alfred, rising quickly and placing himself
between his old friend and the door."What a chance," and he laughed
boisterously."You're not going to get out of my sight this night," he
declared."I'm just beginning to appreciate all you've done for me.""So am I," assented Jimmy, and unconsciously his hand sought the spot
where his dinner should have been, but Alfred was not to be resisted."A man needs someone around," he declared, "when he's going through a
thing like this.I need all of you, all of you," and with his eyes he
embraced the weary circle of faces about him."I feel as though I could
go out of my head," he explained and with that he began tucking the
three small mites in the pink and white crib designed for but one.Zoie regarded him with a bored expression'

"You act as though you WERE out of your head," she commented, but Alfred
did not heed her.He was now engaged in the unhoped for bliss of singing
three babies to sleep with one lullaby.The other occupants of the room were just beginning to relax and to show
some resemblance to their natural selves, when their features were again
simultaneously frozen by a ring at the outside door.CHAPTER XXVIII

Annoyed at being interrupted in the midst of his lullaby, to three,
Alfred looked up to see Maggie, hatless and out of breath, bursting into
the room, and destroying what was to him an ideally tranquil home scene.But Maggie paid no heed to Alfred's look of inquiry.She made directly
for the side of Zoie's bed."If you plaze, mum," she panted, looking down at Zoie, and wringing her
hands.asked Aggie, who had now reached the side of the bed."'Scuse me for comin' right in"--Maggie was breathing hard--"but me
mother sint me to tell you that me father is jus afther comin' home from
work, and he's fightin' mad about the babies, mum."cautioned Aggie and Zoie, as they glanced nervously toward
Alfred who was rising from his place beside the cradle with increasing
interest in Maggie's conversation.he repeated, "your father is mad about babies?""It's all right, dear," interrupted Zoie nervously; "you see," she
went on to explain, pointing toward the trembling Maggie, "this is our
washerwoman's little girl.Our washerwoman has had twins, too, and it
made the wash late, and her husband is angry about it.""Oh," said Alfred, with a comprehensive nod, but Maggie was not to be so
easily disposed of."If you please, mum," she objected, "it ain't about the wash.repeated Alfred, drawing himself up in the fond conviction that
all his heirs were boys, "No wonder your pa's angry.Come now," he said to Maggie, patting the child on the shoulder and
regarding her indulgently, "you go straight home and tell your father
that what HE needs is BOYS.""Well, of course, sir," answered the bewildered Maggie, thinking that
Alfred meant to reflect upon the gender of the offspring donated by her
parents, "if you ain't afther likin' girls, me mother sint the money
back," and with that she began to feel for the pocket in her red flannel
petticoat.repeated Alfred, in a puzzled way, "what money?"It was again Zoie's time to think quickly."The money for the wash, dear," she explained.retorted Alfred, positively beaming generosity, "who talks
of money at such a time as this?"And taking a ten dollar bill from his
pocket, he thrust it in Maggie's outstretched hand, while she was trying
to return to him the original purchase money."Here," he said to the
astonished girl, "you take this to your father.Tell him I sent it to
him for his babies.Tell him to start a bank account with it."This was clearly not a case with which one small addled mind could deal,
or at least, so Maggie decided.She had a hazy idea that Alfred was
adding something to the original purchase price of her young sisters,
but she was quite at a loss to know how to refuse the offer of such
a "grand 'hoigh" gentleman, even though her failure to do so would no
doubt result in a beating when she reached home.She stared at Alfred
undecided what to do, the money still lay in her outstretched hand."I'm afraid Pa'll niver loike it, sir," she said.exclaimed Alfred in high feather, and he himself closed her
red little fingers over the bill, "he's GOT to like it.Now you run along," he concluded to Maggie, as he urged her
toward the door, "and tell him what I say.""Yes, sir," murmured Maggie, far from sharing Alfred's enthusiasm.Feeling no desire to renew his acquaintance with Maggie, particularly
under Alfred's watchful eye, Jimmy had sought his old refuge, the high
backed chair.As affairs progressed and there seemed no doubt of Zoie's
being able to handle the situation to the satisfaction of all concerned,
Jimmy allowed exhaustion and the warmth of the firelight to have their
way with him.His mind wandered toward other things and finally into
space.His head dropped lower and lower on his chest; his breathing
became laboured--so laboured in fact that it attracted the attention of
Maggie, who was about to pass him on her way to the door.Then coming close to the
side of the unsuspecting sleeper, she hissed a startling message in his
ear."Me mother said to tell you that me fadder's hoppin' mad at you,
sir."He studied the young person at his
elbow, then he glanced at Alfred, utterly befuddled as to what had
happened while he had been on a journey to happier scenes.Apparently
Maggie was waiting for an answer to something, but to what?Jimmy
thought he detected an ominous look in Alfred's eyes.Letting his hand
fall over the arm of the chair so that Alfred could not see it, Jimmy
began to make frantic signals to Maggie to depart; she stared at him the
harder."Go away," whispered Jimmy, but Maggie did not move.he
said, and waved her off with his hand.Puzzled by Jimmy's sudden aversion to this apparently harmless child,
Alfred turned to Maggie with a puckered brow.For once Jimmy found it in his heart to be grateful to Zoie for the
prompt answer that came from her direction."The wash, dear," said Zoie to Alfred; "Jimmy had to go after the wash,"
and then with a look which Maggie could not mistake for an invitation to
stop longer, Zoie called to her haughtily, "You needn't wait, Maggie; we
understand.""Sure, an' it's more 'an I do," answered Maggie, and shaking her head
sadly, she slipped from the room.But Alfred could not immediately dismiss from his mind the picture of
Maggie's inhuman parent."Just fancy," he said, turning his head to one side meditatively, "fancy
any man not liking to be the father of twins," and with that he again
bent over the cradle and surveyed its contents."Think, Jimmy," he said,
when he had managed to get the three youngsters in his arms, "just think
of the way THAT father feels, and then think of the way _I_ feel.""And then think of the way _I_ feel," grumbled Jimmy.exclaimed Alfred; "what have you to feel about?"Before Jimmy could answer, the air was rent by a piercing scream and a
crash of glass from the direction of the inner rooms.whispered Aggie, with an anxious glance toward Zoie."Sounded like breaking glass," said Alfred.exclaimed Zoie, for want of anything better to suggest.repeated Alfred with a superior air; "nonsense!Here," he said, turning to Jimmy, "you hold the boys and I'll go
see----" and before Jimmy was aware of the honour about to be thrust
upon him, he felt three red, spineless morsels, wriggling about in his
arms.He made what lap he could for the armful, and sat up in a stiff,
strained attitude on the edge of the couch.In the meantime, Alfred had
strode into the adjoining room with the air of a conqueror.Aggie looked
at Zoie, with dreadful foreboding.shrieked the voice of the Italian mother from the adjoining
room.Regardless of the discomfort of his three disgruntled charges, Jimmy
began to circle the room.So agitated was his mind that he could
scarcely hear Aggie, who was reporting proceedings from her place at the
bedroom door."She's come up the fire-escape," cried Aggie; "she's beating Alfred to
death."shrieked Zoie, making a flying leap from her coverlets."She's locking him in the bathroom," declared Aggie, and with that she
disappeared from the room, bent on rescue.cried Zoie, tragically, and she started in pursuit of
Aggie."Wait a minute," called Jimmy, who had not yet been able to find
a satisfactory place in which to deposit his armful of clothes and
humanity."Eat 'em," was Zoie's helpful retort, as the trailing end of her
negligee disappeared from the room.CHAPTER XXIX

Now, had Jimmy been less perturbed during the latter part of this
commotion, he might have heard the bell of the outside door, which
had been ringing violently for some minutes.As it was, he was wholly
unprepared for the flying advent of Maggie."Oh, plaze, sir," she cried, pointing with trembling fingers toward
the babes in Jimmy's arms, "me fadder's coming right behind me.He's
a-lookin' for you sir.""For me," murmured Jimmy, wondering vaguely why everybody on earth
seemed to be looking for HIM."Put 'em down, sir," cried Maggie, still pointing to the three babies,
"put 'em down.asked Jimmy, now utterly confused as to which way to
turn."There," said Maggie, and she pointed to the cradle beneath his very
eyes."Of course," said Jimmy vapidly, and he sank on his knees and strove to
let the wobbly creatures down easily.And with that
disconcerting warning, she too deserted him.Jimmy rose very cautiously from the
cradle, his eyes sought the armchair.He
looked towards the opposite door; beyond that was the mad Italian woman.His one chance lay in slipping unnoticed through the hallway; he made
a determined dash in that direction, but no sooner had he put his head
through the door, than he drew it back quickly.The conversation between
O'Flarety and the maid in the hallway was not reassuring.Jimmy decided
to take a chance with the Italian mother, and as fast as he could, he
streaked it toward the opposite door.The shrieks and denunciations that
he met from this direction were more disconcerting than those of
the Irish father.For an instant he stood in the centre of the room,
wavering as to which side to surrender himself.The thunderous tones of the enraged father drew nearer; he threw himself
on the floor and attempted to roll under the bed; the space between the
railing and the floor was far too narrow.Why had he disregarded Aggie's
advice as to diet?The knob of the door handle was turning--he vaulted
into the bed and drew the covers over his head just as O'Flarety,
trembling with excitement, and pursued by Maggie, burst into the room."Lave go of me," cried O'Flarety to Maggie, who clung to his arm in a
vain effort to soothe him, and flinging her off, he made straight for
the bed."Ah," he cried, gazing with dilated nostrils at the trembling object
beneath the covers, "there you are, mum," and he shook his fist above
what he believed to be the cowardly Mrs."'Tis well ye may cover
up your head," said he, "for shame on yez!Me wife may take in washing,
but when I comes home at night I wants me kids, and I'll be after havin'
'em too.Then getting no response from the
agitated covers, he glanced wildly about the room.he exclaimed as his eyes fell on the crib; but he stopped short in
astonishment, when upon peering into it, he found not one, or two, but
three "barren.""They're child stalers, that's what they are," he declared to Maggie,
as he snatched Bridget and Norah to his no doubt comforting breast."Me
little Biddy," he crooned over his much coveted possession."Me little
Norah," he added fondly, looking down at his second.The thought of his
narrow escape from losing these irreplaceable treasures rekindled
his wrath.Again he strode toward the bed and looked down at the now
semi-quiet comforter."The black heart of ye, mum," he roared, then ordering Maggie to give
back "every penny of that shameless creetur's money" he turned toward
the door.So intense had been O'Flarety's excitement and so engrossed was he in
his denunciation that he had failed to see the wild-eyed Italian woman
rushing toward him from the opposite door.cried the frenzied woman and, to O'Flarety's astonishment,
she laid two strong hands upon his arm and drew him round until he faced
her.she asked, then peering into
the face of the infant nearest to her, she uttered a disappointed
moan.She scanned the face of the second
infant--again she moaned.Having begun to identify this hysterical creature as the possible mother
of the third infant, O'Flarety jerked his head in the direction of the
cradle."I guess you'll find what you're lookin' for in there," he said.Then
bidding Maggie to "git along out o' this" and shrugging his shoulders
to convey his contempt for the fugitive beneath the coverlet, he swept
quickly from the room.Clasping her long-sought darling to her heart and weeping with delight,
the Italian mother was about to follow O'Flarety through the door when
Zoie staggered into the room, weak and exhausted.called the indignant Zoie to the departing mother."How dare
you lock my husband in the bathroom?"She pointed to the key, which the
woman still unconsciously clasped in her hand."Give me that key," she
demanded, "give it to me this instant.""Take your horrid old key," said the mother, and she threw it on the
floor."If you ever try to get my baby again, I'll lock your husband in
JAIL," and murmuring excited maledictions in her native tongue, she took
her welcome departure.Zoie stooped for the key, one hand to her giddy head, but Aggie, who had
just returned to the room, reached the key first and volunteered to go
to the aid of the captive Alfred, who was pounding desperately on the
bathroom door and demanding his instant release."I'll let him out," said Aggie."You get into bed," and she slipped
quickly from the room.Utterly exhausted and half blind with fatigue Zoie lifted the coverlet
and slipped beneath it.Her first sensation was of touching something
rough and scratchy, then came the awful conviction that the thing
against which she lay was alive.Without stopping to investigate the identity of her uninvited
bed-fellow, or even daring to look behind her, Zoie fled from the room
emitting a series of screams that made all her previous efforts in that
direction seem mere baby cries.So completely had Jimmy been enveloped
in the coverlets and for so long a time that he had acquired a vague
feeling of aloftness toward the rest of his fellows, and had lost all
knowledge of their goings and comings.But when his unexpected companion
was thrust upon him he was galvanised into sudden action by her scream,
and swathed in a large pink comforter, he rolled ignominiously from the
upper side of the bed, where he lay on the floor panting and enmeshed,
awaiting further developments.Of one thing he was certain, a great deal
had transpired since he had sought the friendly solace of the covers and
he had no mind to lose so good a friend as the pink comforter.By the
time he had summoned sufficient courage to peep from under its edge, a
babel of voices was again drawing near, and he hastily drew back in his
shell and waited.Not daring to glance at the scene of her fright, Zoie pushed Aggie
before her into the room and demanded that she look in the bed.Seeing the bed quite empty and noticing nothing unusual in the fact that
the pink comforter, along with other covers, had slipped down behind it,
Aggie hastened to reassure her terrified friend."You imagined it, Zoie," she declared, "look for yourself."Zoie's small face peeped cautiously around the edge of the doorway."Well, perhaps I did," she admitted; then she slipped gingerly into the
room, "my nerves are jumping like fizzy water."They were soon to "jump" more, for at this instant, Alfred, burning with
anger at the indignity of having been locked in the bathroom, entered
the room, demanding to know the whereabouts of the lunatic mother, who
had dared to make him a captive in his own house.he called to Zoie and Aggie, and his eye roved wildly
about the room.Then his mind reverted with anxiety to his newly
acquired offspring.he cried, and he rushed toward the crib."Not ALL of them," said Zoie."All," insisted Alfred, and his hands went distractedly toward his head.Zoie and Aggie looked at each other in a dazed way.They had a hazy
recollection of having seen one babe disappear with the Italian woman,
but what had become of the other two?"I don't know," said Zoie, with the first truth she had spoken that
night, "I left them with Jimmy."shrieked Alfred, and a diabolical light lit his features.he snorted, with sudden comprehension, "then he's at it again.And
with that decision he started toward the outer door.protested Zoie, really alarmed by the look that she saw on
his face.Alfred turned to his trembling wife with suppressed excitement, and
patted her shoulder condescendingly."Control yourself, my dear," he said."Control yourself; I'll get
your babies for you--trust me, I'll get them.And then," he added with
parting emphasis from the doorway, "I'll SETTLE WITH JIMMY!"By uncovering one eye, Jimmy could now perceive that Zoie and Aggie
were engaged in a heated argument at the opposite side of the room.By
uncovering one ear he learned that they were arranging a line of action
for him immediately upon his reappearance.He determined not to wait for
the details.Fixing himself cautiously on all fours, and making sure that he was
well covered by the pink comforter, he began to crawl slowly toward the
bedroom door.Turning away from Aggie with an impatient exclamation, Zoie suddenly
beheld what seemed to her a large pink monster with protruding claws
wriggling its way hurriedly toward the inner room.she screamed, and pointing in horror toward the dreadful
creature now dragging itself across the threshold, she sank fainting
into Aggie's outstretched arms.CHAPTER XXX

Having dragged the limp form of her friend to the near-by couch, Aggie
was bending over her to apply the necessary restoratives, when Alfred
returned in triumph.He was followed by the officer in whose arms were
three infants, and behind whom was the irate O'Flarety, the hysterical
Italian woman, and last of all, Maggie."Bring them all in here, officer," called Alfred over his shoulder."I'll soon prove to you whose babies those are."Then turning to Aggie,
who stood between him and the fainting Zoie he cried triumphantly,
"I've got them Aggie, I've got them.""She's fainted," said Aggie, and stepping from in front of the young
wife, she pointed toward the couch.cried Alfred, with deep concern as he rushed to Zoie
and began frantically patting her hands.Then he turned to the officer, his sense of injury welling high within
him, "You see what these people have done to my wife?Ignoring the uncomplimentary remarks of O'Flarety, he again bent over
Zoie."Rouse yourself, my dear," he begged of her.snorted O'Flarety, unable longer to control his pent up
indignation."I'll let you know when I want to hear from you," snarled the officer to
O'Flarety."But they're NOT her babies," protested the Italian woman desperately."Cut it," shouted the officer, and with low mutterings, the outraged
parents were obliged to bide their time.Lifting Zoie to a sitting posture Alfred fanned her gently until she
regained her senses."Your babies are all right," he assured her."I've
brought them all back to you."gasped Zoie weakly, and she wondered what curious fate had been
intervening to assist Alfred in such a prodigious undertaking."Yes, dear," said Alfred, "every one," and he pointed toward the three
infants in the officer's arms.Zoie turned her eyes upon what SEEMED to her numberless red faces.she moaned and again she swooned."I told you she'd be afraid to face us," shouted the now triumphant
O'Flarety.retorted the still credulous Alfred, "how dare you
persecute this poor demented mother?"Alfred's persistent solicitude for Zoie was too much for the resentful
Italian woman."She didn't persecute me, oh no!"Again Zoie was reviving and again Alfred lifted her in his arms and
begged her to assure the officer that the babies in question were hers."Let's hear her SAY it," demanded O'Flarety."You SHALL hear her," answered Alfred, with confidence.Then he beckoned
to the officer to approach, explaining that Zoie was very weak."Sure," said the officer; then planting himself directly in front of
Zoie's half closed eyes, he thrust the babies upon her attention.Zoie opened her eyes to see three small red faces immediately opposite
her own.she cried, with a frantic wave of her arm, "take them
away!"This hateful reminder brought
Alfred again to the protection of his young and defenceless wife."The excitement has unnerved her," he said to the officer."Ain't you about done with my kids?"asked O'Flarety, marvelling how any
man with so little penetration as the officer, managed to hold down a
"good payin' job.""What do you want for your proof anyway?"But Alfred's
faith in the validity of his new parenthood was not to be so easily
shaken."My wife is in no condition to be questioned," he declared."She's out
of her head, and if you don't----"

He stepped suddenly, for without warning, the door was thrown open and a
second officer strode into their midst dragging by the arm the reluctant
Jimmy."I guess I've got somethin' here that you folks need in your business,"
he called, nodding toward the now utterly demoralised Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, having at last got her breath.cried Alfred, bearing down upon the panting Jimmy with a
ferocious expression."I caught him slipping down the fire-escape," explained the officer.exclaimed Aggie and Alfred in tones of deep reproach."Jimmy," said Alfred, coming close to his friend, and fixing his eyes
upon him in a determined effort to control the poor creature's fast
failing faculties, "you know the truth of this thing.You are the one
who sent me that telegram, you are the one who told me that I was a
father."asked Aggie, trying to protect her dejected
spouse."Of course I am," replied Alfred, with every confidence, "but I have to
prove it to the officer.Then turning to
the uncomfortable man at his side, he demanded imperatively, "Tell the
officer the truth, you idiot.Am I a father or am
I not?""If you're depending on ME for your future offspring," answered Jimmy,
wagging his head with the air of a man reckless of consequences, "you
are NOT a father."gasped Alfred, and he stared at his friend in
bewilderment."Ask them," answered Jimmy, and he nodded toward Zoie and Aggie.Alfred bent over the form of the again prostrate Zoie."My darling,"
he entreated, "rouse yourself.""Now," said
Alfred, with enforced self-control, "you must look the officer squarely
in the eye and tell him whose babies those are," and he nodded toward
the officer, who was now beginning to entertain grave doubts on the
subject.cried Zoie, too exhausted for further lying.exclaimed Alfred, his hand on his forehead."I only borrowed them," said Zoie, "to get you home," and with that she
sank back on the couch and closed her eyes.cried the triumphant O'Flarety."I guess they're your'n all right," admitted the officer doggedly, and
he grudgingly released the three infants to their rightful parents."I guess they'd better be," shouted O'Flarety; then he and the Italian
woman made for the door with their babes pressed close to their hearts.O'Flarety turned in the doorway and raised a warning fist."If you don't leave my kids alone, you'll GIT 'an understanding.'""On your way," commanded the officer to the pair of them, and together
with Maggie and the officer, they disappeared forever from the Hardy
household.he exclaimed; then he turned to
Jimmy who was still in the custody of the second officer: "If I'm not a
father, what am I?""I'd hate to tell you," was Jimmy's unsympathetic reply, and in utter
dejection Alfred sank on the foot of the bed and buried his head in his
hands."What shall I do with this one, sir?"asked the officer, undecided as to
Jimmy's exact standing in the household."Shoot him, for all I care," groaned Alfred, and he rocked to and fro.exclaimed Aggie, then she signalled to the officer to
go."No more of your funny business," said the officer with a parting nod at
Jimmy and a vindictive light in his eyes when he remembered the bruises
that Jimmy had left on his shins.said Aggie sympathetically, and she pressed her hot face
against his round apoplectic cheek.And after all you
have done for us!""Yes," sneered Zoie, having regained sufficient strength to stagger to
her feet, "he's done a lot, hasn't he?"And then forgetting that her
original adventure with Jimmy which had brought about such disastrous
results was still unknown to Aggie and Alfred, she concluded bitterly,
"All this would never have happened, if it hadn't been for Jimmy and his
horrid old luncheon."This was too much, and just as he had seemed to be
well out of complications for the remainder of his no doubt short life.He turned to bolt for the door but Aggie's eyes were upon him.exclaimed Aggie and she regarded him with a puzzled frown.Zoie's hand was already over her lips, but too late.Recovering from his somewhat bewildering sense of loss, Alfred, too, was
now beginning to sit up and take notice.Zoie gazed from Alfred to Aggie, then at Jimmy, then resolving to make
a clean breast of the matter, she sidled toward Alfred with her most
ingratiating manner."Now, Alfred," she purred, as she endeavoured to act one arm about
his unsuspecting neck, "if you'll only listen, I'll tell you the REAL
TRUTH."A wild despairing cry from Alfred, a dash toward the door by Jimmy, and
a determined effort on Aggie's part to detain her spouse, temporarily
interrupted Zoie's narrative.But in spite of these discouragements, Zoie did eventually tell Alfred
the real truth, and before the sun had risen on the beginning of another
day, she had added to her confession, promises whose happy fulfillment
was evidenced for many years after by the chatter of glad young voices,
up and down the stairway of Alfred's new suburban home, and the flutter
of golden curls in and out amongst the sunlight and shadows of his
ample, well kept grounds.When serving in the Punjab about thirty years ago, I was well
acquainted with an old man in Lahore who had been chief armourer to
Runjeet Sing, and he has often told me that the real Damascus blades
contained a large percentage of arsenic amalgamated with the steel while
the blades were being forged, which greatly added to their hardness,
toughness, and strength, preserved the steel from rust, and enabled the
blades to be sharpened to a very fine edge.This old man's test for a
sword-blade was to get a good-sized fish, newly caught from the river,
lay it on a soft, yielding bed,--cotton quilt folded up, or any soft
yielding substance,--and the blade that did not cut the fish in two
across the thickest part behind the gills, cutting against the scales,
at one stroke, was considered of no account whatever.From what I have
seen no sword-blade that bends, however sharp it may be, will do that,
because the spring in the steel causes the blade to glance off the fish,
and the impetus of the cut is lost by the blade quivering in the hand.Nor will any of our straight sword-blades cut a large fish through in
this manner; whereas the curved Oriental blade, with a drawing cut,
severs it at once, because the curved blade presents much more cutting
surface.One revolution of a circular saw cuts much deeper into wood
than one stroke of a straight saw, although the length of the straight
saw may be equal to the circumference of the circular one.So it is with
sword-blades.A stroke from a curved blade, drawn through, cuts far
deeper than the stroke from a straight blade.[63]

I will mention one instance at Lucknow that came under my own notice of
the force of a sword-cut from a curved sword of rigid steel.There were
three brothers of the name of Ready in the Ninety-Third called David,
James, and John.They were all powerful, tall men, in the prime of life,
and all three had served through the Crimea.David was a sergeant, and
his two brothers were privates.When falling in for the assault on the
Begum's palace, John Ready took off his Crimean medal and gave it to his
brother David, telling him that he felt a presentiment that he would be
killed in that attack, and that David had better keep his medal, and
send it home to their mother.David tried to reason him out of his
fears, but to no purpose.John Ready replied that he had no fear, and
his mother might know that he had died doing his duty.Well, the assault
took place, and in the inner courts of the palace there was one division
held by a regiment of dismounted cavalry, armed with swords as keen as
razors, and circular shields, and the party of the Ninety-Third who got
into that court were far out-numbered on this occasion, as in fact we
were everywhere else.On entering James Ready was attacked by a _sowar_
armed with sword and shield.Ready's feather bonnet was knocked off, and
the _sowar_ got one cut at him, right over his head, which severed his
skull clean in two, the sword cutting right through his neck and
half-way down through the breast-bone.John Ready sprang to the
assistance of his brother, but too late; and although his bayonet
reached the side of his opponent and was driven home with a fatal
thrust, in doing so he came within the swoop of the same terrible sword,
wielded by the powerful arm of a tall man, and he also was cut right
through the left shoulder diagonally across the chest, and his head and
right arm were clean severed from the body.The _sowar_ delivered his
stroke of the sword at the same moment that he received the bayonet of
John Ready through his heart, and both men fell dead together.David
Ready, the sergeant, seized the _tulwar_ that had killed both his
brothers, and used it with terrible effect, cutting off heads of men as
if they had been mere heads of cabbage.When the fight was over I
examined that sword.It was of ordinary weight, well-balanced, curved
about a quarter-circle, as sharp as the sharpest razor, and the blade as
rigid as cast-iron.Now, my experience is that none of our very best
English swords could have cut like this one.A sword of that quality
would cut through a man's skull or thigh-bone without the least quiver,
as easily as an ordinary Birmingham blade would cut through a willow.I may also mention the case of a young officer named Banks, of the
Seventh Hussars, who was terribly cut up in charging through a band of
Ghazis.One leg was clean lopped off above the knee, the right arm cut
off, the left thigh and left arm both cut through the bone, each wound
produced by a single cut from a sharp, curved _tulwar_.I don't know if
the young fellow got over it;[64] but he was reported to be still alive,
and even cheerful when we marched from Lucknow.In this matter of sword-blades, I have no wish to dogmatise or to pose
as an authority; I merely state my observations and opinion, in the
hopes that they may lead to experiments being made.The sharpening of our cavalry swords, if still the same as
in 1857, receives far too little attention.FOOTNOTES:

[62] In which case they would have been simply ridden over.Mitchell's are quite true as regards curved
swords; but he forgets that the _point_ is the most effective attack
against Eastern swordsmen.APPENDIX D

THE OPIUM QUESTION


On the afternoon of the 19th August, 1892, I left Cawnpore for Lucknow.As I was a few minutes before time, I walked along the railway-platform
to see the engine, and, strange to relate, the engine attached to the
train which was to take me into Lucknow (under circumstances very
different from those of 1857) was No.In 1857 I had crossed the
Ganges in the ranks of the Ninety-Third Highlanders, with the figures 93
on the front of my cap, and here I was, under very different
circumstances, revisiting Lucknow for the first time thirty-five years
after, and the engine to the train was No.I need not say that I
lifted my hat to that engine.As a matter of fact, I never do pass the
old number without giving it a salute; but in this instance I looked
upon it as a happy omen for the success of my journey.I took my seat in the carriage, and shortly after was joined by a
gentleman whom I took to be a Mahommedan; but to my surprise he told me
that he was a Christian employed in the Educational Department, and that
he was going to Lucknow for a month's holiday.He appeared to be a man
of over sixty years of age, but said he was only fifty-four, and that he
would retire from Government service next year.Of course I introduced
the subject of the Mutiny, and asked him where he had been at the time.He stated that when the Mutiny broke out he was at school in Bareilly,
and that he was then a Mahommedan, but did not join in the rebellion;
that on the outbreak of the Mutiny, when all the Europeans were either
killed or fled from Bareilly, he had retired to his village near
Shahjehanpore, and remained there till order was re-established on the
advance of the English into Rohilcund in May, 1858, after Khan Bahadoor
Khan had reigned in Bareilly twelve months.In course of conversation I asked my companion if he could give any
reason why it was that the whole rural population of Oude had joined the
urban population against the British in 1857, whereas on the south side
of the Ganges the villagers were in favour of the British, where they
were not overawed by the mutineers?He told me a strange thing, and that
was that he was fully convinced that the main reason why the village
population of Oude joined the city population of Lucknow was owing to
the oppression caused by our introduction of the opium-tax among the
people.At first I misunderstood him, and thought I had come across an agent of
the Anti-Opium Society."So you are against Government control of the
opium-cultivation and sale of the drug," I said."I consider the tax on opium a most legitimate source of
revenue.What I mean is that although a just tax, it was a highly
obnoxious one to the citizens of Lucknow and the rural population of
Oude at the time of the Mutiny."He went on to state that although a
Christian convert from Mahommedanism and a strictly temperate man, he
had no sympathy with the anti-opium party; that he considered them a
most dangerous set of fanatics, who would set the whole country in
rebellion again before a twelve-month if they could get the Government
to adopt their narrow-minded views.Regarding 1857, he continued, and I
quote his exact words, as I noted them down immediately after I got to
the hotel:

"Under the rule of the Nawabs of Lucknow many taxes were imposed, which
were abolished by the British; but in their stead the opium-tax was
introduced, which was the most unpopular tax that could have been
devised, because it touched every one, from the _coolie_ in the bazaar
to the noble in his palace.Before the annexation of Oude opium was
untaxed, and was largely consumed by all classes of the people, both in
the capital and in the villages.Though the mass of the people were
well-affected to British rule in general, disloyal agitators had merely
to cite the opium-tax as a most obnoxious and oppressive impost, to
raise the whole population against the British Government, and the same
would be the case again, if ever the British Government were weak enough
to be led by the Anti-Opium Society.""Then," said I, "since you are so much against the Anti-Opium Society, I
suppose you are also against Christian missionaries.""That by no means
follows," was the answer."Many of our most Christian and able
missionaries have as little sympathy with the anti-opium propagandists
as I have.The true missionary aims at reforming the people through the
people, not by compelling moral reformation through the Government,
which would be merely a return to the Inquisition of Rome in another
form.I would encourage missionaries by every possible means; but they
must be broad-minded, earnest, pious men, who mind their own business,
and on no pretence whatever attempt to dictate to Government, or to
control its action either in the matter of taxation or in any other way.I would never encourage men who go about the country railing against the
Government for collecting revenue from one of the most just sources that
can be named.Missionaries of experience know that the mass of the
population are miserably poor, and a pill of opium is almost the only
stimulant in which they indulge.Then, why attempt to deprive them of
it, merely to please a score or so of sentimental faddists?Let the
missionaries mind their own business, and render to Caesar the things
which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.Let them
confine themselves to proclaiming the Gospel to the heathen, and teach
the Bible in their schools; but don't allow them to mix in politics, or
in any way interfere with the government or taxation of the country.I
would throw the English education of the people more into the hands of
the missionaries.Our Government schools are antichristian, and are
making infidels of the people."THE END

most of the housework herself.She baked for the large family, mopped
floors, endured all sorts of drudgery, and even waded through the snow
to milk cows.But with it all she attended school, and made great
progress.She liked grammar and arithmetic, and on one occasion showed
her ability as a speller by spelling down the whole school.She even
went to singing school, and sang in the church choir.Some of the
envious Woodward children ridiculed the hard-working, ambitious girl by
calling her “Lady Angeline,” a title which she lived up to from that
time forth.Let me reproduce here two of her compositions, written when she was
fourteen years of age.They are addressed as letters to her teacher, Mr.George Waldo:

                                               RODMAN, January 21st 1845

    SIR, As you have requested me to write and have given me the
    subjects upon which to write, I thought I would try to write what I
    could about the Sugar Maple.The Sugar Maple is a very beautiful as
    well as useful tree.In the summer the beasts retire to its kind
    shade from the heat of the sun.And though the lofty Oak and pine
    tower above it, perhaps they are no more useful.Sugar is made from
    the sap of this tree, which is a very useful article.It is also
    used for making furniture such as tables bureaus &c. and boards for
    various uses.It is also used to cook Our victuals and to keep us
    warm.But its usefulness does not stop here even the ashes are
    useful; they are used for making potash which with the help of flint
    or sand and a good fire to melt it is made into glass which people
    could not very well do without.Glass is good to help the old to see
    and to give light to our houses.Besides all this teliscopes are
    made of glass by the help of which about all the knowledge of the
    mighty host of planetary worlds has been discovered.This tree is
    certainly very useful.In the first place sugar is made from it.Then it gives us all sorts of beautiful furniture.Then it warms our
    houses and cooks our victuals and then even then we get something
    from the ashes yes something very useful.Teacher’s comment:

    I wish there was a good deal more.The next composition is as follows:

                                SLAVERY.RODMAN February 17th 1845

    Slavery or holding men in bondage is one of the most unjust
    practices.But unjust as it is even in this boasted land of liberty
    many of our greatest men are dealers in buying and selling slaves.Were you to go to the southern states you would see about every
    dwelling surrounded by plantations on which you would see the half
    clothed and half starved slave and his master with whip in hand
    ready to inflict the blow should the innocent child forgetful of the
    smart produced by the whip pause one moment to hear the musick of
    the birds inhale the odor of the flowers or through fatigue should
    let go his hold from the hoe.And various other scenes that none but
    the hardest hearted could behold without dropping a tear of pity for
    the fate of the slave would present themselves probably you would
    see the slave bound in chains and the driver urging him onward while
    every step he takes is leading him farther and farther from his home
    and all that he holds dear.But I hope these cruelties will soon
    cease as many are now advocating the cause of the slave.But still
    there are many that forget that freedom is as dear to the slave as
    to the master, whose fathers when oppressed armed in defence of
    liberty and with Washington at their head gained it.But to their
    shame they still hold slaves.But some countries have renounced
    slavery and I hope their example will be followed by our own.Teacher’s comment:

    I hope so too.When men shall learn to do unto
    others as they themselves wish to be done unto.And not only say but
    _do_ and that _more than_ HALF as they say.Then we may hope to see
    the slave Liberated, and _not_ till _then_._Write again._

The composition on slavery (like the mention of the telescope) is in the
nature of a prophecy, for our astronomer’s wife during her residence of
thirty years in Washington was an unfailing friend of the <DW64>.Many a
Northerner, coming into actual contact with the black man, has learned
to despise him more than Southerners do.The conviction
of childhood, born of reading church literature on slavery and of
hearing her step-father’s indignant words on the subject—for he was an
ardent abolitionist—lasted through life.In the fall of 1847 the ambitious school-girl had a stroke of good
fortune.Her cousin Harriette Downs, graduate of a young ladies’ school
in Pittsfield, Mass., took an interest in her, and paid her tuition for
three terms at the Rodman Union Seminary.So Angeline worked for her
board at her Aunt Clary Downs’, a mile and a half from the seminary, and
walked to school every morning.A delightful walk in autumn; but when
the deep snows came, it was a dreadful task to wade through the drifts.Her skirts would get wet, and she took a severe cold.She never forgot
the hardships of that winter.The next winter she lived in Rodman
village, close to the seminary, working for her board at a Mr.Wood’s,
where on Monday mornings she did the family washing before school began.How thoroughly she enjoyed the modest curriculum of studies at the
seminary none can tell save those who have worked for an education as
hard as she did.That she was appreciated and beloved by her schoolmates
may be inferred from the following extracts from a letter dated
Henderson, Jefferson Co., N.Y., January 9, 1848:

    Our folks say they believe you are perfect or I would not say so
    much about you.They would like to have you come out here & stay a
    wek, they say but not half as much as I would I dont believe, come
    come come.... Your letter I have read over & over again, ther seems
    to be such a smile.I almost immagin I can
    see you & hear you talk while I am reading your letter.... Those
    verses were beautiful, they sounded just lik you.... Good Night for
    I am shure you will say you never saw such a boched up mess

    I ever remain your sincere friend

            E. A. BULFINCH.No doubt as to the genuineness of this document!Angeline had indeed
begun to write verses—and as a matter of interest rather than as an
example of art, I venture to quote the following lines, written in
October, 1847:

             Farewell, a long farewell, to thee sweet grove,
             To thy cool shade and grassy seat I love;
             Farewell, for the autumnal breeze is sighing
             Among thy boughs, and low thy leaves are lying.Farewell, farewell, until another spring
             Rolls round again, and thy sweet bowers ring
             With song of birds, and wild flowers spring,
             And on the gentle breeze their odors fling.Farewell, perhaps I ne’er again may view
             Thy much-loved haunt, so then a sweet adieu.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER IV.––––––
                            TEACHING SCHOOL.In the North teaching follows schooling almost as a matter of course.In
1848 Angeline Stickney began to teach the district school in Heath
Hollow, near Rodman, for a dollar and a quarter a week and board.The
same year she taught also at Pleasant Valley, near Cape Vincent, whither
Edwin Ingalls had moved.Angeline boarded with her sister and spun her
wool.Would that some artist had painted this nineteenth century
Priscilla at the spinning-wheel!For the next nine years, that is, until
a year after her marriage, she was alternately teacher and pupil.In the
winter of 1849-50 she tutored in the family of Elder Bright, who six
years later, in Wisconsin, performed her marriage ceremony.In the
winter of 1850-51 she attended the seminary at Rodman, together with her
sister Ruth.An excellent teacher always, she won the respect and affection of her
pupils.After her death a sturdy farmer of Rodman told me, with great
feeling, how much he liked the patient teacher.He was a dull boy, and
found many perplexities in arithmetic, which Miss Stickney carefully
explained.And so she became the boy’s ideal woman.Very seldom did she
have to resort to punishment, but when punishment was necessary she did
not flinch.The same might be said of her in the rearing of her four
sons.Her gentleness, united to a resolute will and thorough goodness of
heart, made obedience to her word an acknowledged and sacred duty.The following fragment of a letter, written after she had begun her
college course at McGrawville, gives a glimpse of her at this period:

                                                 WATERTOWN Nov.27th ’52

   ... it is half past eight A.M.I
    have had but fourteen scholars yet, but expect more next week.Sister Ruth teaches in the district adjoining this.I see her often,
    have been teaching two weeks.I do not have a very good opportunity
    for studying, or reciting.There is a gentleman living about a mile
    and a half from me to whom I suppose I might recite, but the road is
    bad and so I have to content myself without a teacher, and I fear I
    shall not make much progress in my studies this winter.Saturday Dec
    4th.... I do not teach to-day, so I started off in the rain this
    morning to come and see Sister Ruth.It is about a mile and a half
    across through swamp and woods, but I had a very fine walk after
    all.I had to climb a hill on the way, that may well vie in height
    with the hills of McGrawville, and the prospect from its summit is
    the finest I ever saw.Sister saw me coming and came running to meet
    me and now we are sitting side by side in her school room with none
    to molest us.... I board around the district.... Oh!how I long for
    a quiet little room, where I might write and study....

Let me add here an extract from a brief diary kept in 1851, which
illustrates a phase of her character hardly noticed thus far.She was,
like the best young women of her day and generation, intensely
religious—even morbidly so, perhaps.But as sincerity is the saving
grace of all religions, we may forgive her maidenly effusion:

    Monday June 2 David came and brought me down to school to-day.When
    I came to dinner found uncle Cook at Mr.Think I shall
    attend prayer meeting this evening.Spear always there with something beautiful and instructive to
    say.And the Savior always there to bless us, and to strengthen us.And I feel I am blessed and profited every time that I attend.Tuesday June 3rd Feel sad this evening, have evening, have a hard
    headache, pain in the chest, and cough some.Think Consumption’s
    meagre hand is feeling for my heart strings.Oh that I may be spared
    a little longer, though unworthy of life on earth and how much more
    unfit to live in Heaven.Oh Heavenly Father wash me clean in the
    blood of thy precious son, and fit me for life, or death.I have
    desired to get for me a name that would not be forgotten, when my
    body was moldered into dust.better to have a name in
    the Lamb’s Book of Life.Earth may forget me, but Oh my Savior!do
    not Thou forget me and I shall be satisfied.Wednesday June 4th I am
    sitting now by my chamber window, have been gazing on the beautiful
    clouds of crimson and purple, that are floating in the bright west.How beautiful is our world now in this sweet month, beautiful
    flowers beautiful forests, beautiful fields, beautiful birds, and
    murmuring brooks and rainbows and clouds and then again the clear
    blue sky without clouds or rainbows, or stars, smiling in its own
    calm loveliness Oh yes!this Earth is beautiful, and so exquisitely
    beautiful that I sometimes feel that there is in it enough of beauty
    to feast my eyes forever.Do not feel quite so badly this evening as
    I did last, yet I by no means feel well.------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               CHAPTER V.––––––
                             THE NEXT STEP.“Do the next thing”—such is the sage advice of some practical
philosopher.Had Angeline Stickney failed to keep advancing she would
have sunk into obscurity, as her sisters did, and this story could not
have been written.But ambition urged her forward, in spite of the
morbid religious scruples that made ambition a sin; and she determined
to continue her education.For some time she was undecided whether to go
to Albany, or to Oberlin, or to McGrawville.If she went to Albany,
board would cost her two dollars a week—more than she could well afford.So she finally chose
McGrawville—where both sisters together lived on the incredibly small
sum of one dollar a week—fifty cents for a room and twenty-five cents
each for provisions.As we shall see, she met her future husband at
McGrawville; and so it was not an altogether miserly or unkind fate that
led her thither.She was determined to go to college, and to have Ruth go with her.We
may laugh at the means she employed to raise funds, but we must respect
the determination.The idea of a young woman’s going about the country
teaching monochromatic painting, and the making of tissue-paper flowers!And yet there could have been no demand for a
professional washerwoman in that part of the country.Indeed, Ruth and
Angeline had many a discussion of the money problem.One scheme that
suggested itself—whether in merriment or in earnest I cannot say—was to
dress like men and go to work in some factory.In those days women’s
wages were absurdly small; and the burden of proof and of prejudice
rested on the young woman who maintained her right to go to college.They saved what they could from their paltry women’s wages, and upon
these meagre savings, after all, they finally depended; for the
monochromatic painting and the tissue-paper flowers supplied nothing
more substantial than a little experience.The following extracts from the second and last journal kept by Angeline
Stickney need no explanation.The little book itself is mutely eloquent.It is hand-made, and consists of some sheets of writing paper cut to a
convenient size and stitched together, with a double thickness of thin
brown wrapping paper for a cover.8, 1852].... I intended to go to Lockport to teach
    painting to-day, but the stage left before I was ready to go, so I
    came back home.Ruth and I had our daguerreotypes taken to-day.David here when we arrived at home to carry Ruth to her school.Vandervort came up after the horses
    and sleigh to go to Mr.He said he would carry me to
    Watertown and I could take the stage for Lockport, but the stage had
    left about half an hour before we arrived there, so Mr.Vandervort
    said he would bring me up in the evening.We started after tea and
    arrived here in safety, but too late to do anything towards getting
    a class.Granger the landlord told me I had
    better go and get Miss Cobe to assist me in getting a class.She
    called with me at several places.Did not get much encouragement, so
    I thought best to go to Felts Mills in the afternoon.Tavern bill 3
    shillings, fare from Lockport to the Mills 2 s. Arrived at the Mills
    about 1 o’clock.Proceeded directly to the village school to see if
    any of the scholars wished to take lessons.Found two of them that
    would like to take lessons._Sunday, 11th._ Went to church in the afternoon._Monday,
    12th._ Concluded not to stay at the Mills.Found but three scholars
    there.So in the afternoon I came up to the Great Bend.Several
    called this evening to see my paintings.Went to the school to see if any of the scholars wished to take
    lessons in painting.Thought I would not stay there any
    longer.So when the stage came along in the afternoon I got on
    board, and thought I would stop at Antwerp, but on arriving there
    found that the stage was going to Ogdensburgh this evening.Thought
    I would come as far as Gouverneur.Arrived at Gouverneur about 9
    o’clock._Wednesday 14._ Quite
    stormy, so that I could not get out much, but went to Elder Sawyer’s
    and to Mr.Clark, the principal of the Academy, carried
    the paintings to the hall this afternoon so that the pupils might
    see them.Brought them to me after school and said he would let me
    know next day whether any of the scholars wished to take lessons.I
    am almost discouraged, yet will wait with patience the decisions of
    to-morrow.Clark came down this
    morning.Said Miss Wright, the preceptress, would like to take
    lessons; and I found several others that thought they would take
    lessons.The family consists
    of Mr.Horr and their two daughters, hired girl and a
    little girl that they have adopted, and seven boarders, besides
    myself._Sunday, February 8th._ Have been to church to-day.Went to
    prayer meeting this evening._Monday, 9th._ Went to Mr.Fox’s to-day
    to give Miss Goddard a lesson in painting.Miss Wright also takes
    lessons._Tues., 10th._ This has been a beautiful day.I hear her sweet voice, floating on the south wind,
    and the sound of her approaching footsteps comes from the hills.Have given Miss Goddard two lessons in painting to-day.18th._ Have packed my trunk and expect to leave Gouverneur
    to-morrow morning.Have received two letters to-day, one from Mrs.Shea, and one from Elmina and Ruth.Have settled with all my
    scholars and with Mrs.Horr’s this morning for Antwerp.Fare
    from Gouverneur to Antwerp five shillings.Have endeavored to get a
    class here to-day._Friday, 20th._ Came to North Wilna to-day.Brewer’s and came down to Mr.Gibbs, Electa and
    Miranda at home.It was seven years last October since I left North
    Wilna, yet it looks quite natural here.... _Thursday, March 4th._
    Frederick came and brought me to Philadelphia to-day.Think I shall get something of a class here._Friday._ Have been trying to get a class.Think I shall get a class
    in flowers.Think I shall not
    succeed in forming a class here.The young ladies seem to have no
    time or money to spend except for leap year rides._Sunday, 7th_
    Went to the Methodist church this forenoon.The day is very beautiful, such a day as generally brings joy and
    gladness to my heart, but yet I am rather sad.I would like to sit
    down a little while with Miss Annette and Eleanor Wright to read
    Mrs.Those were golden moments that I spent with them, and
    with Miss Ann in Gouverneur.4th._ It is now four
    weeks since I have written a word in my journal.Did not get a class
    in Philadelphia, so I went down to Evans Mills.Stayed there two
    days but did not succeed in forming a class there, so I thought best
    to go to Watertown.Kirkbride’s 6 s at Mr.From Evans Mills to Watertown $0.50.Came up to Rutland Village
    Wednesday evening, fare 3 s. Went to Mrs.There
    was some prospect of getting a class there.Taught Charlotte to
    paint and Albina to make flowers.Came to Champion Friday March 26th
    to see if I could get a class here.Staplin’s
    Friday evening.K. Jones came and
    brought me up here again.Commenced teaching Wednesday the last day

                              CHAPTER VI.––––––
                             COLLEGE DAYS.New York Central College, at McGrawville, Cortland County, seems to have
been the forerunner of Cornell University.Anybody, white or black, man
or woman, could study there.It was a stronghold of reform in general
and of abolition in particular, numbering among its patrons such men as
John Pierpont, Gerrit Smith, and Horace Greeley.The college was poor,
and the number of students small—about ninety in the summer of 1852,
soon after Angeline Stickney’s arrival.Of this number some were
fanatics, many were idealists of exceptionally high character, and some
were merely befriended by idealists, their chief virtue being a black
skin.A motley group, who cared little for classical education, and
everything for political and social reforms.Declamation and debate and
the preparation of essays and orations were the order of the day—as was
only natural among a group of students who felt that the world awaited
the proper expression of their doctrines.And in justice be it said, the
number of patriotic men and women sent out by this little college might
put to shame the well-endowed and highly respectable colleges of the
country.Angeline Stickney entered fully into the spirit of the place.In a
letter written in December, 1852, she said:

    I feel very much attached to that institution, notwithstanding all
    its faults; and I long to see it again, for its foundation rests on
    the basis of Eternal Truth—and my heart strings are twined around
    its every pillar.To suit her actions to her words, she became a woman suffragist and
adopted the “bloomer” costume.It was worth something in those early
days to receive, as she did, letters from Susan B. Anthony and Horace
Greeley.Of that hard-hitting Unitarian minister and noble poet, John
Pierpont, she wrote, at the time of her graduation:

    The Rev.He preached in the chapel Sunday
    forenoon.He is
    over seventy years old, but is as straight as can be, and his face
    is as fresh as a young man’s.Little did she dream that this ardent patriot would one day march into
Washington at the head of a New Hampshire regiment, and break bread at
her table.Nor could she foresee that her college friends Oscar Fox and
A. J. Warner would win laurels on the battlefields of Bull Run and
Antietam, vindicating their faith with their blood.Both giants in
stature, Captain Fox carried a minie-ball in his breast for forty years,
and Colonel Warner, shot through the hip, was saved by a miracle of
surgery.Of her classmates—there were only four, all men, who graduated
with her—she wrote:

    I think I have three as noble classmates as you will find in any
    College, they are Living Men.It is amusing to turn from college friends to college studies—such a
contrast between the living men and their academic labors.For example,
Angeline Stickney took the degree of A.B.in July, 1855, having entered
college, with a modest preparation, in April, 1852, and having been
absent about a year, from November, 1852 to September, 1853, when she
entered the Junior Class.It is recorded that she studied Virgil the
summer of 1852; the fall of 1853, German, Greek, and mathematical
astronomy; the next term, Greek and German; and the next term, ending
July 12, 1854, Greek, natural philosophy, German and surveying.She
began her senior year with calculus, philosophy, natural and mental, and
Anthon’s Homer, and during that year studied also Wayland’s Political
Economy and Butler’s Analogy.She is also credited with work done in
declamation and composition, and “two orations performed.” Her marks, as
far as my incomplete records show, were all perfect, save that for one
term she was marked 98 per cent in Greek.Upon the credit slip for the
last term her “standing” is marked “1”; and her “conduct” whenever
marked is always 100.However, be it observed that Angeline Stickney not only completed the
college curriculum at McGrawville, but also taught classes in
mathematics.In fact, her future husband was one of her pupils, and has
borne witness that she was a “good, careful teacher.”

If McGrawville was not distinguished for high thinking, it could at
least lay claim to plain living.Let us inquire into the ways and means
of the Stickney sisters.I have already stated that board and lodging
cost the two together only one dollar a week.They wrote home to their
mother, soon after their arrival:

    We are situated in the best place possible for studying domestic
    economy.We bought a quart of milk, a pound of crackers, and a sack
    of flour this morning.Tuition for a term of three months was only five dollars; and poor
students were encouraged to come and earn their way through college.Ruth returned home after one term, and Angeline worked for her board at
a Professor Kingley’s, getting victuals, washing dishes, and sweeping.Even so, after two terms her slender means were exhausted, and she went
home to teach for a year.Returning to college in September, 1853, she
completed the course in two years, breaking down at last for lack of
recreation and nourishment.Ruth returned to McGrawville in 1854, and
wrote home: “found Angie well and in good spirits.We are going to board
ourselves at Mr.Smith’s.” And Angeline herself wrote: “My health has
been quite good ever since I came here.It agrees with me to study....
We have a very pleasant boarding place, just far enough from the college
for a pleasant walk.”

Angeline was not selfishly ambitious, but desired her sister’s education
as well as her own.Before the bar of her Puritanical conscience she may
have justified her own ambition by being ambitious for her sister.In
the fall of 1853 she wrote to Ruth:

    I hope you will make up your mind to come out here to school next
    spring.You can go through college as well as I. As soon as I get
    through I will help you.You can go through the scientific course, I
    should think, in two years after next spring term if you should come
    that term.Then we would be here a year together, and you would get
    a pretty good start.There seems to be a way opening for me to get
    into good business as soon as I get through college.And again, in January, 1854:

    Ruth, I believe I am more anxious to have you come to school than I
    ever was before.I see how much it will increase your influence, and
    suffering humanity calls for noble spirits to come to its aid.And I
    would like to have you fitted for an efficient laborer.I know you
    have intellect, and I would have it disciplined and polished.Come
    and join the little band of reformers here, will you not?Sometimes I get very lonely here, and I never should,
    if you were only here.Tell me in your next letter that you will
    come.I will help you all I can in every thing.But Ruth lacked her sister’s indomitable will.She loved her, and wished
to be with her, whether at home or at college.Indeed, in a letter to
Angeline she said she would tease very hard to have her come home, did
she not realize how her heart was set upon getting an education.Ruth
did return to McGrawville in 1854, but remained only two months, on
account of poor health.The student fare did not agree with the vigorous
Ruth, apparently; and she now gave up further thought of college, and
generously sought to help her sister what she could financially.Though a dime at McGrawville was equivalent to a dollar elsewhere,
Angeline was much cramped for money, and to complete her course was
obliged finally to borrow fifty dollars from her cousin Joseph Downs,
giving her note payable in one year.When her breakdown came, six weeks
before graduation, Ruth, like a good angel, came and took her home.It
was a case of sheer exhaustion, aggravated by a tremendous dose of
medicine administered by a well-meaning friend.Though she returned to
McGrawville and graduated with her class, even producing a sorry sort of
poem for the commencement exercises, it was two or three years before
she regained her health.Such was a common experience among ambitious
American students fifty years ago, before the advent of athletics and
gymnasiums.In closing this chapter, I will quote a character sketch written by one
of Angeline’s classmates:

    _Slate Pencil Sketches—No.L. A. C—and C. A. Stickney._ Miss C—
    is Professor of Rhetoric, and Miss Stickney is a member of the
    Senior Class, in N.Y.A description of their
    personal appearance may not be allowable; besides it could not be
    attracting, since the element of Beauty would not enter largely into
    the sketch.Both are fortunately removed to a safe distance from
    Beauty of the Venus type; though the truth may not be quite
    apparent, because the adornments of mind by the force of association
    have thrown around them the Quakerish veil of _good looks_ (to use
    moderate terms), which answers every desirable end of the most
    charming attractions, besides effectually saving both from the folly
    of Pride.Nevertheless, the writer of this sketch can have no
    earthly object in concealing his appreciation of the high brow, and
    Nymphean make of the one, and the lustrous eye of the other.And these personal characteristics are happily suggestive of the
    marked mental traits of each.The intellect of the one is subtle,
    apprehensive, flexible, docile; with an imagination gay and
    discursive, loving the sentimental for the beauty of it.The
    intellect of the other is strong and comprehensive, with an
    imagination ardent and glowing, inclined perhaps to the sentimental,
    but ashamed to own it.However, let these features pass for the moment until we have
    brought under review some other more obvious traits of character.Miss C—, or if you will allow me to throw aside the _Miss_ and the
    Surname, and say Lydia and Angeline, who will complain?Lydia, then,
    is possessed of a good share of self-reliance—self-reliance arising
    from a rational self-esteem.Whether Angeline possesses the power of
    a proper self-appreciation or not, she is certainly wanting in
    self-reliance.She may manifest much confidence on occasions, but it
    is all acquired confidence; while with Lydia, it is all natural.Lydia goes forward in
    public exercises as though the public were her normal sphere.On the
    other hand Angeline frequently appears embarrassed, though her
    unusual powers of _will_ never suffer her to make a failure.Lydia
    is ambitious; though she pursues the object of her ambition in a
    quiet, complacent way, and appropriates it when secured _all as a
    matter of course_.It is possible with Angeline to be ambitious, but
    _not at once_—and _never_ so naturally.Her ambition is born of
    many-yeared wishes—wishes grounded mainly in the moral nature,
    cherished by friendly encouragements, ripening at last into a
    settled purpose.Thus springs up her ambition, unconfessed—its
    triumph doubted even in the hour of fruition.When I speak of the ambition of these two, I hope to be understood
    as meaning ambition with its true feminine modifications.And this
    is the contrast:—The ambition of the one is a necessity of her
    nature, the ripening of every hour’s aspiration; while the ambition
    of the other is but the fortunate afterthought of an unsophisticated
    wish.Both the subjects of this sketch excel in prose and poetic
    composition.Each may rightfully lay claim to the name of poetess.But Lydia is much the better known in this respect.Perhaps the
    constitution of her mind inclines her more strongly to employ the
    ornaments of verse, in expressing her thoughts; and perhaps the mind
    of Angeline has been too much engrossed in scientific studies to
    allow of extensive English reading, or of patient efforts at
    elaboration.Hence her productions reveal the _poet_ only; while
    those of her friend show both the _poet_ and the _artist_.In truth,
    Lydia is by nature far more artificial than Angeline—perhaps I
    should have said _artistic_.Every line of her composition reveals
    an effort at ornament.The productions of Angeline impress you with
    the idea that the author must have had no foreknowledge of what kind
    of style would come of her efforts.Her style is
    manifestly Calvinistic; in all its features it bears the most
    palpable marks of election and predestination.Its every trait has
    been subjected to the ordeal of choice, either direct or indirect.You know it to be a something _developed_ by constant retouches and
    successive admixtures.Not that it is an _imitation_ of admired
    authors; yet it is plainly the result of an imitative nature—a
    something, not borrowed, but _caught_ from a world of beauties, just
    as sometimes a well-defined thought is the sequence of a thousand
    flitting conceptions.Her style is the offspring, the issue of the
    love she has cherished for the beautiful in other minds yet bearing
    the image of her own.Not so with Angeline, for there is no imitativeness in her nature.Her style can arise from no such commerce of mind, but the Spirit of
    the Beautiful overshadowing her, it springs up in its singleness,
    and its genealogy cannot be traced.But this contrast of style is not the only contrast resulting from
    this difference in imitation and in love of ornament.It runs
    through all the phases of their character.Especially is it seen in
    manner, dress and speech; but in speech more particularly.When
    Lydia is in a passage of unimpassioned eloquence, her speech reminds
    you that the tongue is Woman’s plaything; while Angeline plies the
    same organ with as utilitarian an air as a housewife’s churn-dasher.But pardon this exaggeration: something may be pardoned to the
    spirit of liberty; and the writer is aware that he is using great
    liberties.To return: Lydia has a fine sense of the ludicrous.Her name is
    charmingly appropriate, signifying in the original playful or
    sportive.Her laughter wells up from within, and gurgles out from
    the corners of her mouth.Angeline is but moderately mirthful, and
    her laughter seems to come from somewhere else, and shines on the
    outside of her face like pale moonlight.In Lydia’s mirthfulness
    there is a strong tincture of the sarcastic and the droll.Angeline
    at the most is only humorous.When a funny thing happens, Lydia
    laughs _at_ it—Angeline laughs _about_ it.Lydia might be giggling
    all day alone, just at her own thoughts.Angeline I do not believe
    ever laughs except some one is by to talk the fun.And in sleep,
    while Lydia was dreaming of jokes and quips, Angeline might be
    fighting the old Nightmare.After all, do not understand me as saying that the Professor C—– is
    always giggling like a school-girl; or that the Senior Stickney is
    apt to be melancholy and down in the mouth.I have tried to describe
    their feelings relatively.Lydia has a strong, active imagination, marked by a vivid
    playfulness of fancy.Her thoughts flow on, earnest, yet sparkling
    and flashing like a raven-black eye.Angeline has an imagination
    that glows rather than sparkles.It never scintillates, but
    gradually its brightness comes on with increasing radiance.If the
    thoughts of Lydia flit like fire flies, the thoughts of Angeline
    unfold like the blowing rose.If the fancy of one glides like a
    sylph or tiptoes like a school-girl, the imagination of the other
    bears on with more stateliness, though with less grace.Lydia’s
    imagination takes its flight up among the stars, it turns, dives,
    wheels, peers, scrutinizes, wonders and grows serious and then
    fearful.But the imagination of the other takes its stand like a
    maiden by the side of a clear pool, and gazes down into the depths
    of Beauty.Their different gifts befit their different natures.While one
    revels in delight, the other is lost in rapture; while one is
    trembling with awe, the other is quietly gazing into the mysterious.While one is worshipping the beautiful, the other lays hold on the
    sublime.Beauty is the ideal of the one; sublimity is the normal
    sphere of the other.Both seek unto the spiritual, but through
    different paths.When the qualities of each are displayed, the one
    is a chaste star shining aloft in the bright skies; the other is a
    sunset glow, rich as gold, but garish all around with gray clouds.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER VII.––––––
                          COLLEGE PRODUCTIONS.It is next in order to examine some of the literary
productions of Angeline Stickney while at college.Like the literary
remains of Oliver Cromwell, they are of a strange and uncertain
character.It would be easy to make fun of them; and yet sincerity is
perhaps their chief characteristic.They are Puritanism brought down to
the nineteenth century—solemn, absurd, almost maudlin in their religious
sentimentality, and yet deeply earnest and at times noble.The
manuscripts upon which these literary productions are recorded are worn,
creased, stained, torn and covered with writing—bearing witness to the
rigid economy practiced by the writer.The penmanship is careful, every
letter clearly formed, for Angeline Stickney was not one of those vain
persons who imagine that slovenly handwriting is a mark of genius.First, I will quote a passage illustrating the intense loyalty of our
young Puritan to her Alma Mater:

    About a year since, I bade adieu to my fellow students here, and
    took the farewell look of the loved Alma Mater, Central College.It
    was a “longing, lingering look” for I thought it had never seemed so
    beautiful as on that morning.The rising sun cast a flood of golden
    light upon it making it glow as if it were itself a sun; and so I
    thought indeed it was, a sun of truth just risen, a sun that would
    send forth such floods of light that Error would flee before it and
    never dare to come again with its dark wing to brood over our
    land.—And every time I have thought of Central College during my
    absence, it has come up before me with that halo of golden light
    upon it, and then I have had such longings to come and enjoy that
    light; and now I have come, and I am glad that I am here.Yes, I am
    glad, though I have left my home with all its clear scenes and
    loving hearts; I am glad though I know the world will frown upon me,
    because I am a student of this unpopular institution, and I expect
    to get the name that I have heard applied to all who come here,
    “fanatic.” I am glad that I am here because I love this institution.I love the spirit that welcomes all to its halls, those of every
    tongue, and of every hue, which admits of “no rights exclusive,”
    which holds out the cup of knowledge in it’s crystal brightness for
    all to quaff; and if this is fanaticism, I will glory in the name
    “fanatic.” Let me live, let me die a fanatic.I will not seal up in
    my heart the fountain of love that gushes forth for all the human
    race.And I am glad I am here because there are none here to say,
    “thus far thou mayst ascend the hill of Science and no farther,”
    when I have just learned how sweet are the fruits of knowledge, and
    when I can see them hanging in such rich clusters, far up the
    heights, looking so bright and golden, as if they were inviting me
    to partake.And all the while I can see my brother gathering those
    golden fruits, and I mark how his eye brightens, as he speeds up the
    shining track, laden with thousands of sparkling gems and crowned
    with bright garlands of laurel, gathered from beside his path.No,
    there are none here to whisper, “_that_ is beyond _thy_ sphere, thou
    couldst never scale those dizzy heights”; but, on the contrary, here
    are kind voices cheering me onward.I have long yearned for such
    words of cheer, and now to hear them makes my way bright and my
    heart strong.Next, behold what a fire-eater this modest young woman could be:

    Yes, let the union be dissolved rather than bow in submission to
    such a detestable, abominable, infamous law, a law in derogation of
    the genius of our free institutions, an exhibition of tyranny and
    injustice which might well put to the blush a nation of barbarians.Then is a union of robbers, of
    pirates, a glorious union; for to rob a man of liberty is the worst
    of robberies, the foulest of piracies.Let us just glance at one of
    the terrible features of this law, at the provision which allows to
    the commissioner who is appointed to decide upon the future freedom
    or slavery of the fugitive the sum of ten dollars if he decides in
    favor of his slavery and but five if in favor of freedom.Legislative bribery striking of hands with the basest iniquity!...What are the evils that can accrue to the nation from a dissolution
    of the union?It would
    be but a separation from a parasite that is sapping from us our very
    life.Let them stand alone and be
    abhorred of all nations, that they may the sooner learn the lesson
    of repentance!Such a dissolution would
    strike the death blow to slavery.23, 15 & 16:
    “Thou shalt not deliver over unto his master the servant which is
    escaped from his master unto thee.He shall dwell with thee, even
    among you, in that place which he shall choose.”—The law of God
    against the fugitive slave law.The passages quoted are more fraught with feeling than any of the rest
of the prose selections before me; and I will pass over most of them,
barely mentioning the subjects.There is a silly and sentimental piece
entitled “Mrs.Emily Judson,” in which the demise of the third wife of
the famous missionary is noticed.There is a short piece of
argumentation in behalf of a regulation requiring attendance on public
worship.There is a sophomoric bit of prose entitled “The Spirit Of
Song,” wherein we have a glimpse of the Garden of Eden and its happy
lovers.There is a piece, without title, in honor of earth’s angels, the
noble souls who give their lives to perishing and oppressed humanity.The following, in regard to modern poetry, is both true and well
expressed:

    The superficial unchristian doctrine of our day is that poetry
    flourishes most in an uncultivated soil, that the imagination shapes
    her choicest images from the mists of a superstitious age.The
    materials of poetry must ever remain the same and inexhaustible.Poetry has its origin in the nature of man, in the deep and
    mysterious recesses of the human soul.It is not the external only,
    but the inner life, the mysterious workmanship of man’s heart and
    the slumbering elements of passion which furnish the materials of
    poetry.Finally, because of the subject, I quote the following:

    The study of Astronomy gives us the most exalted views of the
    Creator, and it exalts ourselves also, and binds our souls more
    closely to the soul of the Infinite.It
    teaches that the earth, though it seem so immovable, not only turns
    on its axis, but goes sweeping round a great circle whose miles are
    counted by millions; and though it seem so huge, with its wide
    continents and vast oceans, it is but a speck when compared with the
    manifold works of God.It teaches the form, weight, and motion of
    the earth, and then it bids us go up and weigh and measure the sun
    and planets and solve the mighty problems of their motion.But it
    stops not here.It bids us press upward beyond the boundary of our
    little system of worlds up to where the star-gems lie glowing in the
    great deep of heaven.And then we find that these glittering specks
    are vast suns, pressing on in their shining courses, sun around sun,
    and system around system, in harmony, in beauty, in grandeur; and as
    we view them spread out in their splendour and infinity, we pause to
    think of Him who has formed them, and we feel his greatness and
    excellence and majesty, and in contemplating Him, the most sublime
    object in the universe, our own souls are expanded, and filled with
    awe and reverence and love.And they long to break through their
    earthly prison-house that they may go forth on their great mission
    of knowledge, and rising higher and higher into the heavens they may
    at last bow in adoration and worship before the throne of the
    Eternal.To complete this study of Angeline Stickney’s college writings, it is
necessary, though somewhat painful, to quote specimens of her poetry.For example:

           There was worship in Heaven.An angel choir,
           On many and many a golden lyre
           Was hymning its praise.To the strain sublime
           With the beat of their wings that choir kept time.One is tempted to ask maliciously, “Moulting time?”

Here is another specimen, of which no manuscript copy is in existence,
its preservation being due to the loving admiration of Ruth Stickney,
who memorized it:

            Clouds, ye are beautiful!I love to gaze
            Upon your gorgeous hues and varying forms,
            When lighted with the sun of noon-day’s blaze,
            Or when ye are darkened with the blackest storms.Next, consider this rather morbidly religious effusion in blank verse:

       I see thee reaching forth thy hand to take
       The laurel wreath that Fame has twined and now
       Offers to thee, if thou wilt but bow down
       And worship at her feet and bring to her
       The goodly offerings of thy soul.I see
       Thee grasp the iron pen to write thy name
       In everlasting characters upon
       The gate of Fame’s fair dome.Ah, take not yet the wreath of Fame, lest thou
       Be satisfied with its false glittering
       And fail to win a brighter, fairer crown,—
       Such crown as Fame’s skilled fingers ne’er have learned
       To fashion, e’en a crown of Life.And bring
       Thy offerings, the first, the best, and place
       Them on God’s altar, and for incense sweet
       Give Him the freshness of thy youth.And thus
       Thou mayest gain a never fading crown.And wait not now to trace thy name upon
       The catalogue of Fame’s immortal ones, but haste thee first
       To have it writ in Heaven in the Lamb’s Book of Life.Pardon this seeming betrayal of a rustic poetess.For it seems like
betrayal to quote such lines, when she produced much better ones.For
example, the following verses are, to my mind, true and rather good
poetry:

                   I have not known thee long friend,
                   Yet I remember thee;
                   Aye deep within my heart of hearts
                   Shall live thy memory.And I would ask of thee friend
                   That thou wouldst think of me.Likewise:

          I love to live.There are ten thousand cords
          Which bind my soul to life, ten thousand sweets
          Mixed with the bitter of existence’ cup
          Which make me love to quaff its mingled wine.There are sweet looks and tones through all the earth
          That win my heart.Love-looks are in the lily’s bell
          And violet’s eye, and love-tones on the winds
          And waters.There are forms of grace which all
          The while are gliding by, enrapturing
          My vision.O, I can not guess how one
          Can weary of the earth, when ev’ry year
          To me it seems more and more beautiful;
          When each succeeding spring the flowers wear
          A fairer hue, and ev’ry autumn on
          The forest top are richer tints.When each
          Succeeding day the sunlight brighter seems,
          And ev’ry night a fairer beauty shines
          From all the stars....

Likewise, this rather melancholy effusion, entitled “Waiting”:

                Love, sweet Love, I’m waiting for thee,
                And my heart is wildly beating
                At the joyous thought of meeting
                With its kindred heart so dear.Love, I’m waiting for thee here.Love, _now_ I am waiting for thee._Soon_ I shall not wait thee more,
                Neither by the open casement,
                Nor beside the open door
                Shall I sit and wait thee more.Love, I shall not wait long for thee,
                Not upon Time’s barren shore,
                For I see my cheek is paling,
                And I feel my strength is failing.Love, I shall not wait here for thee.When I ope the golden door
                I will ask to wait there for thee,
                Close beside Heaven’s open door.There I’ll stand and watch and listen
                Till I see thy white plumes glisten,
                Hear thy angel-pinions sweeping
                Upward through the ether clear;
                Then, beloved, at Heaven’s gate meeting,
                This shall be my joyous greeting,
                “Love, I’m waiting for thee here.”

                             CHAPTER VIII.––––––
                         ASAPH HALL, CARPENTER.Like many other impecunious Americans (Angeline Stickney included),
Asaph Hall, carpenter, and afterwards astronomer, came of excellent
family.He was descended from John Hall, of Wallingford, Conn., who
served in the Pequot War.The same John Hall was the progenitor of Lyman
Hall, signer of the Declaration of Independence and Governor of Georgia.The carpenter’s great-grandfather, David Hall, an original proprietor of
Goshen, Conn., was killed in battle near Lake George on that fatal 8th
of September, 1755.[1] His grandfather, Asaph Hall 1st, saw service in
the Revolution as captain of Connecticut militia.This Asaph and his
sister Alice went from Wallingford about 1755, to become Hall pioneers
in Goshen, Conn., where they lived in a log house.Alice married; Asaph
prospered, and in 1767 built himself a large house.He was a friend of
Ethan Allen, was with him at the capture of Ticonderoga, and was one of
the chief patriots of Goshen.He saw active service as a soldier, served
twenty-four times in the State legislature, and was a member of the
State convention called to ratify the Federal Constitution.Hall Meadow,
a fertile valley in the town of Goshen, still commemorates his name.He
accumulated considerable property, so that his only child, the second
Asaph Hall, born in 1800 a few months after his death, was brought up a
young gentleman, and fitted to enter Yale College.But the mother
refused to be separated from her son, and before he became of age she
set him up in business.His inheritance rapidly slipped away; and in
1842 he died in Georgia, where he was selling clocks, manufactured in
his Goshen factory.Footnote 1:

  _See Wallingford Land Records, vol.541._

Asaph Hall 3rd, born October 15, 1829, was the eldest of six children.His early boyhood was spent in easy circumstances, and he early acquired
a taste for good literature.But at thirteen he was called upon to help
his mother rescue the wreckage of his father’s property.Fortunately,
the Widow, Hannah (Palmer) Hall, was a woman of sterling character, a
daughter of Robert Palmer, first of Stonington, then of Goshen, Conn.To
her Asaph Hall 3rd owed in large measure his splendid physique; and who
can say whether his mental powers were inherited from father or mother?For three years the widow and her children struggled to redeem a
mortgaged farm.During one of these years they made and sold ten
thousand pounds of cheese, at six cents a pound.It was a losing fight,
so the widow retired to a farm free from mortgage, and young Asaph, now
sixteen, was apprenticed to Herrick and Dunbar, carpenters.He served an
apprenticeship of three years, receiving his board and five dollars a
month.During his first year as a journeyman he earned twenty-two
dollars a month and board; and as he was still under age he gave one
hundred dollars of his savings to his mother.Her house was always home
to him; and when cold weather put a stop to carpentry, he returned
thither to help tend cattle or to hunt gray squirrels.For the young
carpenter was fond of hunting.One winter he studied geometry and algebra with a Mr.Rice, principal of
the Norfolk Academy.But he found he was a better mathematician than his
teacher.Indeed, he had hardly begun his studies at McGrawville when he
distinguished himself by solving a problem which up to that time had
baffled students and teachers alike.Massachusetts educators would have us believe that a young man of
twenty-five should have spent nine years in primary and grammar schools,
four years more in a high school, four years more at college, and three
years more in some professional school.Supposing the victim to have
begun his career in a kindergarten at the age of three, and to have
pursued a two-years’ course there, at twenty-five his education would be
completed.He would have finished his education, provided his education
had not finished him.Now at the age of twenty-four or twenty-five Asaph Hall 3rd only began
serious study.He brought to his tasks the vigor of an unspoiled youth,
spent in the open air.He worked as only a man of mature strength can
work, and he comprehended as only a man of keen, undulled intellect can
comprehend.His ability as a scholar called forth the admiration of
fellow-students and the encouragement of teachers.The astronomer
Brünnow, buried in the wilds of Michigan, far from his beloved Germany,
recognized in this American youth a worthy disciple, and Dr.Benjamin
Apthorp Gould, father of American astronomy, promptly adopted Asaph Hall
into his scientific family.If our young American’s experience puts conventional theories of
education to the blush, much more does his manhood reflect upon the
theory that unites intellectuality with personal impurity.The historian
Lecky throws a glamor over the loathesomeness of what is politely known
as the social evil, and calls the prostitute a modern priestess.And it
is well known that German university students of these degenerate days
consider continence an absurdity.Asaph Hall was as pure as Sir
Gallahad, who sang:

                My good blade carves the casques of men,
                My tough lance thrusteth sure,
                My strength is as the strength of ten,
                Because my heart is pure.Let it be conceded that this untutored American youth had had an
excellent course in manual training—anticipating the modern fad in
education by half a century.However, he had never belonged to an Arts
and Crafts Movement, and had never made dinky little what-nots or other
useless and fancy articles.He had spent eight years at carpenter work;
three years as an apprentice and five years as a journeyman, and he was
a skilful and conscientious workman.He handled his tools as only
carpenters of his day and generation were used to handle them, making
doors, blinds, and window-sashes, as well as hewing timbers for the
frames of houses.Monuments of his handiwork, in the shape of well-built
houses, are to be seen in Connecticut and Massachusetts to this day.Like other young men of ability, he was becomingly modest, and his boss,
old Peter Bogart, used to say with a twinkle in his eye, that of all the
men in his employ, Asaph Hall was the only one who didn’t know more than
Peter Bogart.And yet it was Asaph Hall who showed his fellow carpenters how to
construct the roof of a house scientifically.“Cut and try” was their
rule; and if the end of a joist was spoilt by too frequent application
of the rule, they took another joist.But the young carpenter knew the
thing could be done right the first time; and so, without the aid of
text-book or instructor, he worked the problem out, by the principles of
projection.The timbers sawed according to his directions fitted
perfectly, and his companions marveled.To himself the incident meant much, for he had proved himself more than
a carpenter.His ambition was aroused, and he resolved to become an
architect.But a kindly Providence led him on to a still nobler calling.In 1854 he set out for McGrawville thinking that by the system of manual
labor there advertised he could earn his way as he studied.When the
stage rolled into town, whom should he see but Angeline Stickney,
dressed in her “bloomer” costume!------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER IX.––––––
                        COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE.President Eliot of Harvard University is quoted as saying that marriage
ought to unite two persons of the same religious faith: otherwise it is
likely to prove unhappy.President Eliot has said many wise things, but
this is not one of them—unless he is shrewdly seeking to produce
bachelors and spinsters to upbuild his university.One of Angeline
Stickney’s girl friends had a suitor of the Universalist denomination,
and a very fine man he was; but the girl and her mother belonged to the
Baptist denomination, which was the denomination of another suitor, whom
she married for denominational reasons.Abbreviating the word, her
experience proves the following principle: If a young woman belonging to
the Baptist demnition rejects an eligible suitor because he belongs to
the Universalist demnition, she is likely to go to the demnition
bow-wows.For religious tolerance even in matrimony there is the best of reasons:
We are Protestants before we are Baptists or Universalists, Christians
before we are Catholics or Protestants, moralists before we are Jews or
Christians, theists before we are Mohammedans or Jews, and human before
every thing else.Angeline Stickney, like her girl friend, was a sincere Baptist.Had
joined the church at the age of sixteen.One of her classmates, a person
of deeply religious feeling like herself, was a suitor for her hand.But
she married Asaph Hall, who was outside the pale of any religious sect,
disbelieved in woman-suffrage, wasted little sympathy on <DW64>s, and
played cards!And her marriage was infinitely more fortunate than her
friend’s.To be sure she labored to convert her splendid Pagan, and
partially succeeded; but in the end he converted her, till the Unitarian
church itself was too narrow for her.Cupid’s ways are strange, and sometimes whimsical.There was once a
young man who made fun of a red-haired woman and used to say to his
companions, “Get ready, get ready,” till Reddy got him!No doubt the
little god scored a point when Asaph Hall saw Angeline Stickney solemnly
parading in the “bloomer” costume.Good humor was one of the young man’s
characteristics, and no doubt he had a hearty laugh at the young lady’s
expense.But Dan Cupid contrived to have him pursue a course in geometry
taught by Miss Stickney; and, to make it all the merrier, entangled him
in a plot to down the teacher by asking hard questions.The teacher did
not down, admiration took the place of mischief, and Cupid smiled upon a
pair of happy lovers.The love-scenes, the tender greetings and affectionate farewells, the
ardent avowals and gracious answers—all these things, so essential to
the modern novel, are known only in heaven.The lovers have lived their
lives and passed away.Some words of endearment are preserved in their
old letters—but these, gentle reader, are none of your business.However, I may state with propriety a few facts in regard to Angeline
Stickney’s courtship and marriage.It was characteristic of her that
before she became engaged to marry she told Asaph Hall all about her
father.He, wise lover, could distinguish between sins of the stomach
and sins of the heart, and risked the hereditary taint pertaining to the
former—and this although she emphasized the danger by breaking down and
becoming a pitiable invalid.Just before her graduation she wrote:

    I believe God sent you to love me just at this time, that I might
    not get discouraged.How very good and beautiful you seemed to me that Saturday night
    that I was sick at Mr.Porter’s, and you still seem just the same.I
    hope I may sometime repay you for all your kindness and love to me.If I have already brightened your hopes and added to your joy I am
    thankful.I hope we may always be a blessing to each other and to
    all around us; and that the great object of our lives may be the
    good that we can do.There are a great many things I wish to say to
    you, but I will not try to write them now.I hope I shall see you
    again soon, and then I can tell you all with my own lips.Do not
    study too hard, Love, and give yourself rest and sleep as much as
    you need.Yours truly,

                A. HALL.C. A. S.

After her graduation, Mr.Hall accompanied her to Rodman, where he
visited her people a week or ten days—a procedure always attended with
danger to Dan Cupid’s plans.In this case, it is said the young
carpenter was charmed with the buxom sister Ruth, who was, in fact, a
much more marriageable woman than Angeline.But he went about to get the
engagement ring, which, in spite of a Puritanical protest against such
adornment, was faithfully worn for twenty years.At last the busy
housewife burned her fingers badly washing lamp-chimneys with carbolic
acid, and her astronomer husband filed asunder the slender band of gold.That the Puritan maiden disdained the feminine display by which less
manly lovers are ensnared is illustrated by the following extract from a
letter to Mr.Hall:

    Last week Wednesday I went to Saratoga.Staid there till the
    afternoon of the next day.Antoinette L. Brown, Lucy Stone Blackwell,
    Ernestine Rose, Samuel J. May, and T. W. Higginson.The streets of Saratoga were thronged with fashionables.I never saw
    before such a display of dress.Poor gilded butterflies, no object
    in life but to make a display of their fine colors.I could not help
    contrasting those ladies of fashion with the earnest, noble, working
    women who stood up there in that Convention, and with words of
    eloquence urged upon their sisters the importance of awaking to
    usefulness.This letter was written in August, 1855, when Angeline Stickney was
visiting friends and relatives in quest of health.In the same letter
she sent directions for Mr.Hall to meet her in Albany on his way to
McGrawville; but for some reason he failed her, although he passed
through the city while she was there.This was a grievous
disappointment, of which she used to speak in after years.But in a few days they were together at McGrawville, where she remained
ten weeks—visiting friends, of course.November 13 she set out for
Wisconsin, hoping to find employment as a teacher near her sister
Charlotte Ingalls.At depots and
hotels, during the journey westward, she thought of the absent lover,
and sent him long messages.In one letter she said:

    One night I dreamed you had gone away somewhere, without letting any
    one know where, and I tried to find where you had gone but could
    not.When I awoke it still
    seemed a reality.... You must be a good boy and not go away where I
    shall not know where you are.... It makes my heart ache to think
    what a long weary way it is from Wisconsin to McGrawville.In the same letter she speaks about lengthening a poem, so that the time
occupied in reading it was about twenty minutes.Hall rather discouraged his wife’s inclination to write verses.Is it
possible that he flattered her before marriage?If so, it was no more
than her other admirers did.Again, in the same letter, she pleads for the cultivation of religion:

    Did you go to the prayer-meeting last evening?It seemed to me that
    you were there.If you do not wish to go alone I am sure Mr.Fox
    will go with you.You must take some time, Love, to think of the
    life beyond the grave.You must not be so much engaged in your
    studies that you cannot have time to think about it and prepare for
    it.About the middle of December she had reached Elkhorn, Wisconsin, where
she remained a fortnight with Elder Bright, her old pastor.Then she
went to her sister Charlotte’s, at Milford.In one of her letters from
this place she speaks of going surveying.It seems the surveyor of the
neighborhood was surprised to find a woman who understood his business.In the latter part of December, Asaph Hall returned to Goshen, Conn.Hence the following letter:

                                                GOSHEN, Jan.DEAREST ANGIE:... I think of you a great deal, Angie, and sometimes
    when I feel how much better and holier you are than I am, I think
    that I ought to go through with much trial and affliction before I
    shall be fitted for your companion.In this way I presume that my
    letters have been shaded by my occasional sad thoughts.But Angie
    you _must not_ let them affect you any more, or cherish gloomy
    thoughts about me.I would not drive the color from your cheek or
    give you one bad thought concerning me for the world.I want, very
    much, to see you look healthy and strong when I meet you.... Every
    time I go away from home, among strangers, I feel my need of you.My
    friends here, even my sisters, seem cold and distant when compared
    with you.O there is no one like the dear one who nestles in our
    hearts, and loves us always.My mother loves me, and is very dear to
    me, and my sisters too, but then they have so many other things to
    think about that their sympathies are drawn towards other objects.I
    must have you, Angie, to love me, and we will find a good happy home
    somewhere, never fear.And now you must be cheerful and hopeful, try
    to get rid of your headaches, and healthy as fast as you can.... You
    must remember that I love you very much, and that with you life
    looks bright and hopeful, while if I should lose you I fear that I
    should become sour and disheartened, a hater of my kind.May God
    bless you, Angie.Yours Truly,

                A. HALL.Hall was in Milford, Wisconsin, whence he wrote to
Angeline’s mother as follows:

                                          MILFORD, WISCONSIN, Feb.WOODWARD:... I find Angeline with her health much
    improved.... We expect to be married some time this spring.I fear
    that I shall fail to fulfil the old rule, which says that a man
    should build his house before he gets his wife, and shall commence a
    new life rather poor in worldly goods.But then we know how, and are
    not ashamed to work, and feel trustful of the future.At least, I am
    sure that we shall feel stronger, and better fitted to act an
    honorable part in life, when we are living together, and encouraging
    each other, than we could otherwise.I know that this will be the
    case with myself, and shall try to make it so with Angeline.Yours Sincerely,

                ASAPH HALL.This hardly sounds like the epistle of a reluctant lover; and yet
tradition says the young carpenter hesitated to marry; and for a brief
season Angeline Stickney remembered tearfully that other McGrawville
suitor who loved her well, but whose bashful love was too tardy to
forestall the straightforward Mr.“The course of true love never
did run smooth.” In this case, the trouble seems to have been the lady’s
feeble health.When they were married she was very weak, and it looked
as if she could not live more than two or three years.But her mental
powers were exceptionally strong, and she remembered tenaciously for
many a year the seeming wrong.However, under date of April 2, 1856, Angeline wrote to her sister Mary,
from Ann Arbor, Michigan:

    Mr.Hall and I went to Elder Bright’s and staid over Sunday.We were
    married Monday morning, and started for this place in the afternoon.Hall came here for the purpose of pursuing his studies.We have
    just got nicely settled.Shall remain here during the summer term,
    and perhaps three or four years.And so Asaph Hall studied astronomy under the famous Brünnow, and French
under Fasquelle.And he used to carry his frail wife on his back across
the fields to hunt wild flowers.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                               CHAPTER X.––––––
                      ANN ARBOR AND SHALERSVILLE.Christopher, the strong man who
served his masters well, but was dissatisfied in their service until he
heard of the Lord and Master Jesus Christ?—how he then served gladly at
a ford, carrying pilgrims across on his back—how one day a little child
asked to be carried across, and perching on his broad shoulders grew
heavier and heavier till the strong man nearly sank beneath the weight?But he struggled manfully over the treacherous stones, and with a
supreme effort bore his charge safely through the waters.And behold,
the little child was Christ himself!I think of that legend when I think of the poor ambitious scholar,
literally saddled by his invalid wife.For three years he hardly kept
his head above water.At one time he thought he could go no further, and
proposed that she stay with his mother while he gained a better footing.But she pleaded hard, and he struggled through, to receive the reward of
duty nobly done.But in that time Asaph
Hall had made so favorable an impression that Professor Brünnow urged
him to continue his studies, and arranged matters so that he might
attend college at Ann Arbor as long as he chose without paying tuition
fees.Angeline made plans for her sister Ruth and husband to move to
Michigan, where Asaph could build them a house.They went southward into Ohio,
where they spent a month with Angeline’s Aunt Achsah Taylor, her
mother’s sister.You may be sure they earned their board, Angeline in
the house and Asaph in the hayfield.Uncle Taylor was a queer old
fellow, shedding tears when his hay got wet, and going off to the hotel
for dinner when his wife happened to give him the wrong end of a fish.August 6, 1856, they arrived at Shalersville, Ohio, where they had
engaged to teach at the Shalersville Institute.Here they remained till
about May 1 of the next year, when Angeline returned to Rodman with
funds enough to pay with interest the money borrowed from her cousin
Joseph Downs; and Asaph proceeded to Cambridge, Mass., where the
director of the Harvard Observatory was in need of an assistant.Let it not be inferred that teaching at Shalersville was financially
profitable.Asaph Hall concluded that he preferred carpentry.And yet,
in the best sense they were most successful—things went smoothly—their
pupils, some of them school teachers, were apt—and they were well liked
by the people of Shalersville.Indeed, to induce them to keep school the
last term the townspeople presented them with a purse of sixty dollars
to eke out their income.Asaph Hall turned his mechanical skill to use
by making a prism, a three-sided receptacle of glass filled with water.Saturdays he held a sort of smoke-talk for the boys—the smoke feature
absent—and at least one country boy was inspired to step up higher.The little wife was proud of her manly husband, as the following passage
from a letter to her sister Ruth shows:

    He is real good, and we are very happy.He is a real noble, true man
    besides being an extra scholar, so you must never be concerned about
    my not being happy with him.He will take just the best care of me
    that he possibly can.It appears also that she was converting her husband to the profession of
religion.Before he left Ohio he actually united with the Campbellites,
and was baptized.In the letter just quoted Angeline says:

    We have been reading some of the strongest arguments against the
    Christian religion, also several authors who support religion, and
    he has come to the conclusion that all the argument is on the side
    of Christianity.When he was threatened with
a severe fever, she wrapped him up in hot, wet blankets, and succeeded
in throwing the poison off through the pores of the skin.So they
cherished each other in sickness and in health.Angeline’s cousin Mary Gilman, once a student at McGrawville, came to
Shalersville seeking to enlarge the curriculum of the institute with a
course in fine arts.She hindered more than she helped, and in January
went away—but not till she had taught Angeline to paint in oil.News came of the death of Joseph
Downs, and Angeline wrote to her aunt, his mother:

    He always seemed like a brother to me.I remember all our long walks
    and rides to school.How kind it was in him to carry me all that
    cold winter.Then our rides to church, and all the times we have
    been together.... I can send you the money I owed him any time.... I
    never can be enough obliged to him for his kindness in lending me
    that money, and I wished to see him very much, that I might tell him
    how thankful I felt when he sent it to me.Her sister Ruth wrote:

    Sweet sister, I am so _very lonely_.It would do me so much good to
    tell you all I wish.I have never found... one so _willing to share
    all my grief and joy_.But when Angeline did at length return to Rodman, Ruth’s comfort must
have been mixed with pain.A letter to Asaph tells the story:

    It is almost dark, but I wish to write a few words to you before I
    go to bed.I have had one of those bad spells of paralysis this
    afternoon, so that I could not speak for a minute or two.... I do
    not know what is to become of me.If I had some quiet little room
    with you perhaps I might get strength slowly and be good for
    something after awhile.... I do not mourn much for the blasting of
    my own hopes of usefulness; but I can not bear to be the canker worm
    destroying all your beautiful buds of promise.She remained in poor health a long time—so thin and pale that old
acquaintances hardly knew her.She wrote:

    I feel something as a stranger feels in a strange land I guess.This
    makes me turn to you with all the more love.My home is where you
    are.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XI.––––––
                            STRENUOUS TIMES.They had left Shalersville resolved that Asaph should continue his
studies, but undecided where to go.Professor Brünnow invited him to Ann
Arbor; and Mr.Bond, director of the Harvard College Observatory,
encouraged him to go there.Besides, the famous mathematician Benjamin
Peirce taught at Harvard.Not till they reached Cleveland was the
decision made.The way West was barred by a storm on Lake Erie, and
Angeline said, “Let’s go East.”

So she returned to Rodman for a visit, while her husband set out for
Harvard University.Fifty years and more have passed since then.Their
four sons have long since graduated at Harvard, and growing
grandchildren are turning their eyes thither.Hall talked with
Professors Peirce and Bond, and with the dean of the faculty, Professor
Hosford.All gave him encouragement, and he proceeded to Plymouth
Hollow, Conn., now called Thomaston, to earn money enough at carpentry
to give him a start.He earned the highest wages given to carpenters at
that time, a dollar and a half a day; but his wife’s poor health almost
discouraged him.On May 19, 1857, he wrote her as follows:

    I get along very well with my work, and try to study a little in the
    evenings, but find it rather hard business after a day’s labor.... I
    don’t fairly know what we had better do, whether I had better keep
    on with my studies or not.It would be much pleasanter for you, I
    suppose, were I to give up the pursuit of my studies, and try to get
    us a home.But then, as I have no tact for money-making by
    speculation, and it would take so long to earn enough with my hands
    to buy a home, we should be old before it would be accomplished, and
    in this case, my studies would have to be given up forever.I do not
    like to do this, for it seems to me that with two years’ more study
    I can attain a position in which I can command a decent salary.Perhaps in less time, I can pay my way at Cambridge, either by
    teaching or by assisting in the Observatory.But how and where we
    shall live during the two years is the difficulty.I shall try to
    make about sixty dollars before the first of August.With this money
    I think that I could stay at Cambridge one year and might possibly
    find a situation so that we might make our home there.But I think that it is not best that we should both go to Cambridge
    with so little money, and run the risk of my finding employment.You
    must come here and stay with our folks until I get something
    arranged at Cambridge, and then, I hope that we can have a permanent
    home.... Make up your mind to be a stout-hearted little woman for a
    couple of years.Yours,

                ASAPH HALL.But Angeline begged to go to Cambridge with him, although she wrote:

    These attacks are so sudden, I might be struck down instantly, or
    become helpless or senseless.About the first of July she went to Goshen, Conn., to stay with his
mother, in whom she found a friend.Though very delicate, she was
industrious.Her husband’s strong twin sisters wondered how he would
succeed with such a poor, weak little wife.But Asaph’s mother assured
her son that their doubts were absurd, as Angeline accomplished as much
as both the twins together.So it came to pass that in the latter part of August, 1857, Asaph Hall
arrived in Cambridge with fifty dollars in his pocket and an invalid
wife on his arm.George Bond, son of the director of the
observatory, told him bluntly that if he followed astronomy he would
starve.He had no money, no social position, no friends.What right had
he and his delicate wife to dream of a scientific career?The best the
Harvard Observatory could do for him the first six months of his stay
was to pay three dollars a week for his services.Then his pay was
advanced to four dollars.Early in 1858 he got some extra work—observing
moon-culminations in connection with Col.Joseph E. Johnston’s army
engineers.For each observation he received a dollar; and fortune so far
favored the young astronomer that in the month of March he made
twenty-three such observations.His faithful wife, as regular as an
alarm clock, would waken him out of a sound sleep and send him off to
the observatory.In 1858, also, he began to eke out his income by
computing almanacs, earning the first year about one hundred and thirty
dollars; but competition soon made such work unprofitable.In less than
a year he had won the respect of Mr.George Bond by solving problems
which that astronomer was unable to solve; and at length, in the early
part of 1859, upon the death of the elder Bond, his pay was raised to
four hundred dollars a year.After his experience such a salary seemed quite munificent.The twin
sisters visited Cambridge and were much dissatisfied with Asaph’s
poverty.They tried to persuade Angeline to make him go into some more
profitable business.Sibley, college librarian, observing his shabby
overcoat and thin face, exclaimed, “Young man, don’t live on bread and
milk!” The young man was living on astronomy, and his delicate wife was
aiding and abetting him.In less than a year after his arrival at
Cambridge, he had become a good observer.He
was pursuing his studies with great ardor.He read _Brünnow’s Astronomy_
in German, which language his wife taught him mornings as he kindled the
fire.In 1858 he was reading _Gauss’s Theoria Motus_.Angeline was determined her husband should make good use of the talents
God had given him.She was courageous as only a Puritan can be.In
domestic economy she was unsurpassed.Husband and wife lived on much
less than the average college student requires.She mended their old
clothes again and again, turning the cloth; and economized with
desperate energy.At first they rented rooms and had the use of the kitchen in a house on
Concord Avenue, near the observatory.But their landlady proving to be a
woman of bad character, after eight or nine months they moved to a
tenement house near North Avenue, where they lived a year.Here they
sub-let one of their rooms to a German pack-peddler, a thrifty man,
free-thinker and socialist, who was attracted to Mrs.He used to argue with her, and to read to her from
his books, until finally she refused to listen to his doctrines,
whereupon he got very angry, paid his rent, and left.One American feels himself as good as another—if not better—especially
when brought up in a new community.But Cambridge was settled long ago,
and social distinctions are observed there.It was rather exasperating
to Asaph Hall and his wife to be snubbed and ignored and meanly treated
because they were poor and without friends.Even their grocer seemed to
snub them, sending them bad eggs.You may be sure they quit him
promptly, finding an honest grocer in Cambridgeport, a Deacon Holmes.Relieved of petty social cares
and distractions a man can work.Hall, writing to her sister Mary,
February 4, 1859, declared her husband was “getting to be a _grand_
scholar”:

   .... A little more study and Mr.Hall will be excelled by few in
    this country in his department of science.Indeed that is the case
    now, though he is not very widely known yet.In another letter, dated December 15, 1858, she wrote:

    People are beginning to know something of Mr.Hall’s worth and
    ability.May 4, 1858 she wrote:

    Mr.Hall has just finished computing the elements of the orbit of
    one [a comet] which have been published neatly in the _Astronomical
    Journal_.B. A. Gould, editor of the Journal, became acquainted with
the young astronomer who was afterward his firm friend and his associate
in the National Academy of Sciences.Merit wins recognition—recognition of the kind which is worth while.It
was not many months before the Halls found friends among quiet,
unassuming people, and formed friendships that lasted for life.It was
worth much to become acquainted with Dr.In a letter of February 4, 1859, already cited, Mrs.Hall and I have both had some nice presents this winter,” and she
mentions a Mrs.Pritchett, an astronomer clergyman from Missouri, was the father of Dr.Henry S. Pritchett, a recent president of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.Hall had given him some assistance in his studies; and
twenty years afterward Henry S. Pritchett, the son, became a member of
the Hall family.“We are having a holiday,” wrote Mrs.Hall, on the first May-day spent
in Cambridge; “the children are keeping May-day something like the old
English fashion.It is a beautiful day, the warmest we have had this
spring.Got some dandelions, and
blossoms of the soft maple.Have made quite a pretty bouquet.” The tone
of morbidness was beginning to disappear from her letters, for her
health was improving.Her religious views were growing broader and more
reasonable, also.Too poor to rent a pew in any of the churches, she and
her husband attended the college chapel, where they heard the Rev.In the following poem, suggested by one of his sermons, she
seems to embody the heroic experience of those early days in Cambridge:

                   “THE MOUNTAINS SHALL BRING PEACE.”

         O grand, majestic mountain!far extending
             In height, and breadth, and length,—
         Fast fixed to earth yet ever heavenward tending,
             Calm, steadfast in thy strength!Type of the Christian, thou; his aspirations
             Rise like thy peaks sublime.The rocks immutable are thy foundations,
             His, truths defying time.Like thy broad base his love is far outspreading;
             He scatters blessings wide,
         Like the pure springs which are forever shedding
             Sweet waters down thy side.“The mountains shall bring peace,”—a peace transcending
             The peace of sheltered vale;
         Though there the elements ne’er mix contending,
             And its repose assail,

         Yet ’tis the peace of weakness, hiding, cow’ring;—
             While thy majestic form
         In peerless strength thou liftest, bravely tow’ring
             Above the howling storm.And there thou dwellest, robed in sunset splendor,
             Up ’mid the ether clear,
         Midst the soft moonlight and the starlight tender
             Of a pure atmosphere.So, Christian soul, to thy low states declining,
             There is no peace for thee;
         Mount up!where the calm heavens are shining,
             Win peace by victory!What giant forces wrought, O mount supernal!Back in the early time,
         In building, balancing thy form eternal
             With potency sublime!O soul of mightier force, thy powers awaken!Build thou foundations which shall stand unshaken
             When heaven and earth shall flee.thy heart with earthquake shocks was rifted,
             With red fires melted through,
         And many were the mighty throes which lifted
             Thy head into the blue.Let Calv’ry tell, dear Christ!the sacrificing
             By which thy peace was won;
         And the sad garden by what agonizing
             The world was overcome.throughout thy grand endeavor
             Pray not that trials cease!’Tis these that lift thee into Heaven forever,
             The Heaven of perfect peace.The young astronomer and his Wife used
to attend the Music Hall meetings in Boston, where Sumner, Garrison,
Theodore Parker, and Wendell Phillips thundered away.On one occasion,
after Lincoln’s election, Phillips spoke advocating disunion.The crowd
was much excited, and threatened to mob him.“Hurrah for old Virginny!”
they yelled.Phillips was as calm as a Roman; but it was necessary to
form a body-guard to escort him home.Asaph Hall was a six-footer, and
believed in fair play; so he joined the little knot of men who bore
Phillips safely through the surging crowd.In after years he used to
tell of Phillips’ apparent unconcern, and of his courteous bow of thanks
when arrived at his doorstep.Angeline Hall had an adventure no less interesting.She became
acquainted with a shrewd old negress, called Moses, who had helped many
slaves escape North, stirring up mobs, when necessary, to free the
fugitives from the custody of officers.One day she went with Moses to
call upon the poet Lowell.Was glad to have
a chat with the old woman, and smilingly asked her if it did not trouble
her conscience to resist the law.Moses was ready to resist the law
again, and Lowell gave her some money.Superstitious people hailed the advent of Donati’s comet as a sign of
war—and Angeline Hall was yet to mourn the loss of friends upon the
battlefield.But hoping for peace and loving astronomy, she published
the following verses in a local newspaper:

                            DONATI’S COMET.O, not in wrath but lovingly,
                  In beauty pure and high,
                Bright shines the stranger visitant,
                  A glory in our sky.No harbinger of pestilence
                  Nor battle’s fearful din;
                Then open wide, ye gates of heaven,
                  And let the stranger in.It seems a spirit visible
                  Through some diviner air,
                With burning stars upon her brow
                  And in her shining hair.Through veil translucent, luminous
                  Shines out her starry face,
                And wrapped in robes of light she glides
                  Still through the silent space.And fill till it o’errun
                Thy silver horn thou ancient moon,
                  From fountains of the sun!But open wide the golden gates
                  Into your realm of Even,
                And let the angel presence pass
                  In glory through the heaven.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XII.––––––
                           LOVE IN A COTTAGE.Miss Sarah Waitt, a Cambridge school-teacher of beautiful character, and
firm friend of Angeline Hall, once said, after an acquaintance of thirty
years or more, that she had never known of a happier married life than
that of Mr.He opposed his wife’s writing
poetry—not from an aversion to poetry, but because poetry inferior to
the best is of little value.The wife, accustomed as an invalid to his
thoughtful attentions, missed his companionship as health returned.What
were her feelings the first night she found herself obliged to walk home
alone!But thereafter, like a more consistent apostle of woman’s rights,
she braved the night alone wherever duty led.She undertook to help her
husband in his computations, but, failing to persuade him that her time
was worth as much as his, she quit work.He could, indeed, compute much
faster than she, but she feelingly demanded a man’s wages.However, this labor trouble subsided without resort to boycott.The most
serious quarrel—and for a time it was very dreadful—arose in this way:

It is well known that Boston is the intellectual and moral centre of the
country, in fact of the world; the hub of the universe, as it were.There in ancient times witchcraft and the Quaker superstition were
gently but firmly discouraged (compare _Giles Corey_, Longfellow’s fine
drama, long since suppressed by Boston publishers).There in modern
times descendants of the Puritans practice race-suicide and Irishmen
practice politics.There a white man is looked upon as the equal of a
<DW64>, though somewhat inferior, in many ways, to the Boston woman.Now
it so happened that some Boston and Cambridge ladies of Angeline Hall’s
acquaintance had resolved beyond equivocation that woman should
thenceforth be emancipated from skirts.Hall, in college days, had worn the “bloomer” costume.So they very
generously suggested that she have the honor of inaugurating bloomers in
Boston and vicinity.Truly it showed a self-sacrificing spirit on the
part of these ladies to allow this comparatively unknown sister to reap
the honor due her who should abolish skirts.They would not for one
moment think of robbing her of this honor by donning bloomers
themselves.They could only suggest that the reform be instituted
without delay, and they were eager to see how much the Boston public
would appreciate it.He reminded his wife that they were just struggling
to their feet, and the bloomers might ruin their prospects.A pure-minded woman to be interfered with in this manner!And worse than that, to think that she had married a coward!“A
coward”—yes, that is what she called him.It so happened, shortly
afterward, that the astronomer, returning home one night, found his wife
by the doorstep watching a blazing lamp, on the point of explosion.He
stepped up and dropped his observing cap over the lamp.Whereupon she
said, “You _are_ brave!” Strange she had not noticed it before!Asaph Hall used to aver that a family quarrel is not always a bad thing.Could he have been thinking of his
own experience?It is possible that the little quarrels indicated above
led to a clearer understanding of the separate duties of husband and
wife, and thence to a division of labor in the household.The secret of
social progress lies in the division of labor.And the secret of success
and great achievement in the Hall household lay in the division of
labor.Hall confined his attention to astronomy,
and Mrs.The world gained a worthy
astronomer.Did it lose a reformer-poetess?But it was richer
by one more devoted wife and mother.From the spring of 1859 to the end of their stay in Cambridge, that is,
for three years, the Halls occupied the cozy little Bond cottage, at the
top of Observatory Hill.Back of the cottage they had a vegetable
garden, which helped out a small salary considerably.There in its
season they raised most delicious sweet corn.In the dooryard, turning
an old crank, was a rosy-cheeked little boy, who sang as he turned:

                         Julee, julee, mem, mem,
                         Julee, julee, mem, mem;

then paused to call out:

“Mama, don’t you like my sweet voice?”

Asaph Hall, Jr., was born at the Bond cottage, October 6, 1859.If we
may trust the accounts of his fond mother, he was a precocious little
fellow—played bo-peep at four months—weighed twenty-one pounds at six
months, when he used to ride out every day in his little carriage and
get very rosy—took his first step at fourteen months, when he had ten
teeth—was quite a talker at seventeen months, when he tumbled down the
cellar stairs with a pail of coal scattered over him—darned his stocking
at twenty-six months, and demanded that his aunt’s letter be read to him
three or four times a day—at two and a half years trudged about in the
snow in his rubber boots, and began to help his mother with the
housework, declaring, “I’m big enough, mama.” “Little A.” was a general
favorite.He fully enjoyed a clam bake, and was very fond of oranges.One day he got lost, and his terrified mother thought he might have
fallen into a well.But he was found at last on his way to Boston to buy
oranges.Love in a cottage is sweeter and more prosperous when the cottage stands
a hundred miles or more from the homes of relatives.How can wife cleave
unto husband when mother lives next door?And how can husband prosper
when father pays the bills?It was a fortunate piece of hard luck that
Angeline Hall saw little of her people.As it was, her sympathy and
interest constantly went out to mother and sisters.In one she threatened to rescue her mother from the irate
Mr.Woodward by carrying her off bodily to Cambridge.By others it
appears that she was always in touch with her sisters Ruth and Mary.Indeed, during little A.’s early infancy Mary visited Cambridge and
acted as nurse.In the summer of 1860, little A. and his mother visited
Rodman.Charlotte Ingalls was on from the West, also, and there was a
sort of family reunion.Charlotte, Angeline and Ruth, and their cousins
Huldah and Harriette were all mothers now, and they merrily placed their
five babies in a row.In the fall of the same year Angeline visited her aunts, Lois and
Charlotte Stickney, who still lived on their father’s farm in Jaffrey,
New Hampshire.The old ladies were very poor, and labored in the field
like men, maintaining a pathetic independence.Angeline was much
concerned, but found some comfort, no doubt, in this example of Stickney
grit.She had found her father’s old home, heard his story from his
sisters’ lips, learned of the stalwart old grandfather, Moses Stickney;
and from that time forth she took a great interest in the family
genealogy.In 1863 she visited Jaffrey again, and that summer ascended
Mt.Just twenty-five years afterward,
accompanied by her other three sons, she camped two or three weeks on
her grandfather’s farm; and it was my own good fortune to ascend the
grand old mountain with her.Great white
clouds lay against the blue sky in windrows.At a distance the rows
appeared to merge into one great mass; but on the hills and fields and
ponds below the shadows alternated with the sunshine as far as eye could
reach.There beneath us lay the rugged land whose children had carried
Anglo-Saxon civilization westward to the Pacific.Moses Stickney’s farm
was a barren waste now, hardly noticeable from the mountain-top.Lois
and Charlotte had died in the fall of 1869, within a few days of each
other.House and barn had disappeared, and the site was marked by
raspberry bushes.We drew water from the old well; and gathered the dead
brush of the apple orchard, where our tent was pitched, to cook our
victuals.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                             CHAPTER XIII.––––––
                     WASHINGTON AND THE CIVIL WAR.Many an obscure man of ability was raised to prominence by the Civil
War.So it was with the astronomer, Asaph Hall.A year after the war
broke out, the staff of workers at the U.S.Some resigned to go South; others were ordered elsewhere by
the Federal Government.In the summer of 1862, while his wife was
visiting her people in Rodman, Mr.Hall went to Washington, passed an
examination, and was appointed an “Aid” in the Naval Observatory.On August 27, three weeks after he entered
the observatory, Mr.Hall wrote to his wife:

    When I see the slack, shilly-shally, expensive way the Government
    has of doing everything, it appears impossible that it should ever
    succeed in beating the Rebels.He soon became disgusted at the wire-pulling in Washington, and wrote
contemptuously of the “_American_ astronomy” then cultivated at the
Naval Observatory.But he decided to make the best of a bad bargain; and
his own work at Washington has shed a lustre on American astronomy.When he left Cambridge, thanks to his frugal wife, he had three hundred
dollars in the bank, although his salary at the Harvard Observatory was
only six hundred a year.The Bonds hated to lose him, and offered him
eight hundred in gold if he would stay.This was as good as the
Washington salary of one thousand a year in paper money which he
accepted, to say nothing of the bad climate and high prices of that
city, or of the uncertainties of the war.The next three years were teeming with great events.In less than a
month after his arrival in Washington, the second battle of Bull Run was
fought.At the observatory he heard the roar of cannon and the rattle of
musketry; and it was his heart-rending task to hunt for wounded friends.His wife, still at the North, wrote under date of September 4, 1862:

    DEAREST ASAPH:... I wish I could go right on to you, I feel so
    troubled about you.You will write to me, won’t you, as soon as you
    get this, and tell me whether to come on now or not.If there is
    danger I had rather share it with you.Little A says he does not want papa to get shot.Cried about it last
    night, and put his arms round my neck.He says he is going to take
    care of mamma.To this her husband replied, September 6:

    DEAREST ANGIE: I have just got your letter.... You must not give
    yourself any uneasiness about me.I shall keep along about my
    business.We are now observing the planet Mars in the morning, and I
    work every other night.Don’t tell little A that I am going to be shot.Don’t expect
    anything of that kind.You had better take your time and visit at
    your leisure now.Things will be more settled in a couple of weeks.Fox [his room-mate at McGrawville] seems to be doing well.The
    ball is in his chest and probably lodged near his lungs.It may kill
    him, but I think not....

Observing Mars every other night, and serving Mars the rest of the time!His wife’s step-brothers Constant and Jasper Woodward were both wounded.Jasper, the best of the Woodward brothers, was a lieutenant, and led his
company at Bull Run, the captain having scalded himself slightly with
hot coffee in order to keep out of the fight.Jasper was an exceedingly
bashful fellow, but a magnificent soldier, and he fairly gloried in the
battle.When he fell, and his company broke in retreat, Constant paused
to take a last shot in revenge, and was himself wounded.Hall found
them both, Constant fretful and complaining, though not seriously
wounded, and Jasper still glorying in the fight.The gallant fellow’s
wound did not seem fatal; but having been left in a damp stone church,
he had taken cold in it, so that he died.Next followed the battle of Antietam, and the astronomer’s wife, unable
to find out who had won, and fearful lest communication with Washington
might be cut off if she delayed, hastened thither.A. J.
Warner, a McGrawville schoolmate, whose family lived with the Halls in
Georgetown, was brought home shot through the hip.To add to the trials
of the household, little A. and the colonel’s boy Elmer came down with
diphtheria.Through the unflagging care and nursing of his mother,
little A. lived.Hall, exhausted by the hot,
unwholesome climate no less than by his constant exertions in behalf of
wounded friends, broke down, and was confined within doors six weeks
with jaundice.Indeed, it was two years before he fully recovered.Strange that historians of the Civil War have not dwelt upon the
enormous advantage to the Confederates afforded by their hot, enervating
climate, so deadly to the Northern volunteer.In January, 1863, the Halls and Warners moved to a house in Washington,
on I Street, between 20th and 21st Streets, N.W.Here a third surgical
operation on the wounded colonel proved successful.Though he nearly
bled to death, the distorted bullet was at last pulled out through the
hole it had made in the flat part of the hip bone.Deceived by the
doctors before, the poor man cried: “Mr.Is the
ball out?”

Soon after this, in March, small-pox, which was prevalent in the city,
broke out in the house, and Mr.Hall sent his wife and little boy to
Cambridge, Mass.There she stayed with her friend Miss Sarah Waitt; and
there she wrote the following letter to Captain Gillis, Superintendent
of the Naval Observatory:

                                               CAMBRIDGE, Apr.Gillis._

    DEAR SIR: I received a letter from Mr.Hall this morning saying that
    Prof.Hesse has resigned his place at the Observatory.If the question is one of ability, I should be more than willing
    that he with all other competitors should have a thorough and
    impartial examination.I know I should be proud of the result.If on
    the other hand the question is who has the greatest number of
    influential friends to push him forward whether qualified or
    unqualified, I fear, alas!He stands alone on his
    merits, but his success is only a question of time.I, more than any
    one, know of all his long, patient and faithful study.A few years,
    and he, like Johnson, will be beyond the help of some Lord
    Chesterfield.Hall writes me that he shall do nothing but wait.I could not
    bear not to have his name at least proposed.Truly,

                ANGELINE S. HALL.Hall wrote to his wife from Washington:

    DEAREST ANGIE: Yesterday afternoon Capt.Gillis told me to tell you
    that the best answer he could make to your letter is that hereafter
    you might address me as Prof.A. Hall....

    You wrote to Capt.Yours,

                A. HALL.And so it was that Asaph Hall entered permanently into the service of
the United States Government.His position in life was at last secure,
and the rest of his days were devoted completely to science.His wife,
grown stronger and more self-reliant, took charge of the family affairs
and left him free to work.That summer he wrote to her, “It took me a
long time to find out what a good wife I have got.”

Some fifteen years afterward Mrs.Hall rendered a similar service to the
famous theoretical astronomer, Mr.George W. Hill, who for several years
was an inmate of her house.Hill’s rare abilities, and his
extreme modesty, Mrs.Hall took it upon herself to urge his appointment
to the corps of Professors of Mathematics, U.S.Navy, to which her
husband belonged.There were two vacancies at the time, and Mr.Hill,
having brilliantly passed a competitive examination, was designated for
appointment.But certain influences deprived the corps of the lustre
which the name of Hill would have shed upon it.In the fall of 1863 the Halls settled down again in the house on I
Street.Here the busy little wife made home as cheerful as the times
permitted, celebrating her husband’s birthday with a feast.But the I
Street home was again invaded by small-pox.Captain Fox, having been
appointed to a government clerkship, was boarding with them, when he
came down with varioloid.Hall’s sister, on a visit to
Washington, caught the small-pox from him.However, she recovered
without spreading the disease.In May, 1864, they rented rooms in a house on the heights north of the
city.Crandle, was a Southern sympathizer; but
when General Jubal A. Early threatened the city he was greatly alarmed.On the morning of July 12 firing was heard north of the city.Crandle,
with a clergyman friend, had been out very early reconnoitering, and
they appeared with two young turkeys, stolen somewhere in anticipation
of the sacking of the city.For the Confederates were coming, and the
house, owned as it was by a United States officer, would surely be
burned.A hiding place for the family had been found in the Rock Creek
valley.Hall went to his work that morning as usual; but he did not return.Hall, who was soon to give birth to another son, took little Asaph
and went in search of her husband.He was not at the observatory, but
the following note explained his absence:

                                                          July 12, 1864.DEAR ANGIE: I am going out to Fort Lincoln.Don’t know how long I
    shall stay.Keep
    cool and take good care of little A.

            Yours truly,

                A. HALL.Hall was put in command
of workmen from the Navy Yard, who manned an intrenchment near Fort
Lincoln.Many of the men were foreigners, and some of them did not know
how to load a gun.Had the Confederates charged upon them they might
have been slaughtered like sheep.But in a day or two Union troops
arrived in sufficient force to drive Early away.Before the summer was over, the Halls moved to a house in Georgetown, on
the corner of West and Montgomery Streets.It was an old-fashioned brick
house, with a pleasant yard fenced by iron pickets.These were made of
old gun barrels, and gave the place the name of “Gunbarrel Corner.”
Here, on the 28th of September, 1864, their second child, Samuel, was
born.And here the family lived for three years, renting rooms to
various friends and relatives.Charles Kennon, whose soldier husband lost his life in the Red River
expedition, leaving her with three noble little sons.Kennon and the
Halls had been neighbors in Cambridge, where he studied at the Harvard
Divinity School.Hall had objected to having a home in Washington,
and had looked to New England as a fitter place for his family to live;
but his wife would not be separated from him.The curse of war was upon
the city.Crowded with sick and wounded soldiers, idle officers and
immoral women, it was scourged by disease.Forty cases of small-pox were
at one time reported within half a mile of the place where Mr.But people had become so reckless as to attend a ball at a
small-pox hospital.Most of the native population were Southern
sympathizers, and some of the women were very bitter.They hated all
Yankees—people who had lived upon saw-dust, and who came to Washington
to take the Government offices away from Southern gentlemen.As Union
soldiers were carried, sick and wounded, to the hospital, these women
would laugh and jeer at them.But there were people in Washington who were making history.Hall saw Grant—short, thin, and stoop-shouldered, dressed in his
uniform, a slouch hat pulled over his brow—on his way to take command of
the Army of the Potomac.That venerable patriot John Pierpont, whom she
had seen and admired at McGrawville, became attached to Mrs.Hall, and
used to dine at her house.She took her little boy to one of Lincoln’s
receptions, and one night Lincoln and Secretary Stanton made a visit to
the Naval Observatory, where Mr.Hall showed them some objects through
his telescope.At the Cambridge Observatory the Prince of Wales had once
appeared, but on that occasion the young astronomer was made to feel
less than nobody.Now the great War President, who signed his commission
in the United States Navy, talked with him face to face.One night soon
afterward, when alone in the observing tower, he heard a knock at the
trap door.He leisurely completed his observation, then went to lift the
door, when up through the floor the tall President raised his head.Lincoln had come unattended through the dark streets to inquire why the
moon had appeared inverted in the telescope.Surveyors’ instruments,
which he had once used, show objects in their true position.At length the war was over, and the Army of the Potomac and Sherman’s
Army passed in review through the city.Hall was one of those who
witnessed these glorious spectacles—rank after rank, regiment after
regiment of seasoned veterans, their battle-flags torn and begrimed,
their uniforms shabby enough but their arms burnished and glistening,
the finest soldiers in the world!Among the officers was General
Osborne, an old Jefferson County acquaintance.Among all the noble men of those heroic times, I, for my part, like to
think of old John Pierpont, the minister poet, who broke bread at my
mother’s table.Whether this predilection is due to prenatal causes,
some Oliver Wendell Holmes may decide.Certain it is that I was born in
September, 1868, and in the preceding April my mother wrote:

          O dear anemone, and violet fair,
            Beloved hepatica, arbutus sweet!Two years ago I twined your graces rare,
            And laid the garland at the poet’s feet.The grand old poet on whose brow the snow
            Of eighty winters lay in purest white,
          But in whose heart was held the added glow
            Of eighty summers full of warmth and light.Like some fair tree within the tropic clime
            In whose green boughs the spring and autumn meet,
          Where wreaths of bloom around the ripe fruits twine,
            And promise with fulfilment stands complete,

          So twined around the ripeness of his thought
            An ever-springing verdure and perfume,
          All his rich fullness from October caught
            And all her freshness from the heart of June.But last year when the sweet wild flowers awoke
            And opened their dear petals to the sun,
          He was not here, but every flow’ret spoke
            An odorous breath of him the missing one.Of this effusion John Greenleaf Whittier—to whom the verses were
addressed—graciously wrote:

    The first four verses of thy poem are not only very beautiful from
    an artistic point of view, but are wonderfully true of the man they
    describe.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XIV.––––––
                          THE GAY STREET HOME.In November, 1867, the Halls bought the Captain Peters’ place, No.18
Gay Street, Georgetown, and for twenty-five years, that is, for the rest
of Angeline Hall’s life, this was her home.The two-story brick house,
covered with white stucco, and having a shingled roof, stood in the
centre of a generous yard, looking southward.Wooden steps led up to a
square front porch, the roof of which was supported by large wooden
pillars.The front door opened into a hall, with parlor on the right
hand and sitting room on the left.Back of the sitting room was the
dining room, and back of that the kitchen.In the year of the
Centennial, 1876, the house was enlarged to three stories, with a flat
tin roof, and three bay-windows were added, one in the dining room and
two in front of the house, and the front porch was lengthened so as to
extend from one bay window to the other.The new house was heated
chiefly by a furnace and a large kitchen range, but in the dining room
and sitting room grates were put in for open coal fires.The two rooms
were thrown together by sliding doors, and became the centre of home
comfort; though the room over the sitting room, where, in a low
cane-seated rocking chair of oak, Mrs.Hall sat and did the family
sewing, was of almost equal importance.In the sitting room hung the
old-fashioned German looking-glass with its carved and gilded frame, the
gift of Dr.Over the fire-place was an engraving of Lincoln,
and in one corner of the room was the round mahogany table where
Professor Hall played whist with his boys.Over the dining room mantle
hung a winter scene painted by some relative of the family, and in the
bay window stood Mrs.[Illustration: THE GAY STREET HOME]


In the front yard was a large black-heart cherry tree, where house-wrens
built their nests, a crab-apple tree that blossomed prodigiously, a
damson plum, peach trees, box-trees and evergreens.The walks were
bordered with flower beds, where roses and petunias, verbenas and
geraniums, portulacas and mignonnette blossomed in profusion.In the
back yard was a large English walnut tree, from the branches of which
the little Halls used to shoot the ripe nuts with their bows and arrows.In another part of the back yard was Mrs.Hall’s hot-bed, with its seven
long sashes, under which tender garden plants were protected during the
winter, and sweet English violets bloomed.Along the sidewalk in front
of the premises was a row of rather stunted rock-maples; for the
Southern soil seemed but grudgingly to nourish the Northern trees.Such, in bare outline, was the Gay Street home.Here on September 16,
1868, the third child, Angelo, was born.Among the boys of the
neighborhood 18 Gay Street became known as the residence of “Asaph, Sam,
and Angelico.” This euphonious and rhythmical combination of names held
good for four years exactly, when, on September 16, 1872, the fourth and
last child, Percival, was born.One of my earliest recollections is the
sight of a red, new-born infant held in my father’s hands.It has been
humorously maintained that it was my parents’ design to spell out the
name “Asaph” with the initials of his children.I am inclined to
discredit the idea, though the pleasantry was current in my boyhood, and
the fifth letter,—which might, of course, be said to stand for Hall,—was
supplied by Henry S. Pritchett, who as a young man became a member of
the family, as much attached to Mrs.In fact, when
Asaph was away at college, little Percival used to say there were five
boys in the family _counting Asaph_.As a curious commentary upon this
letter game, I will add that my own little boy Llewellyn used to
pronounce his grandfather’s name “Apas.” Blood is thicker than water,
and though the letters here are slightly mixed, the proper four, and
four only, are employed.So it came to pass that Angeline Hall reared her four sons in the
unheard-of and insignificant little city of Georgetown, whose sole claim
to distinction is that it was once the home of Francis Scott Key.What a
pity the Hall boys were not brought up in Massachusetts!And yet how
glad I am that we were not!In Georgetown Angeline Hall trained her sons
with entire freedom from New England educational fads; and for her sake
Georgetown is to them profoundly sacred.Here it was that this woman of
gentle voice, iron will, and utmost purity of character instilled in her
growing boys moral principles that should outlast a lifetime.One day
when about six years old I set out to annihilate my brother Sam.I had a
chunk of wood as big as my head with which I purposed to kill him.He
happened to be too nimble for me, so that the fury of my rage was
ungratified.She told me in heartfelt words the inevitable consequences of such
actions—and from that day dated my absolute submission to her authority.In this connection it will not be amiss to quote the words of Mrs.John
R. Eastman, for thirteen years our next-door neighbor:

    During the long days of our long summers, when windows and doors
    were open, and the little ones at play out of doors often claimed a
    word from her, I lived literally within sound of her voice from day
    to day.Never once did I hear it raised in anger, and its sweetness,
    and steady, even tones, were one of her chief and abiding charms.The fact is, Angeline Hall rather over-did the inculcation of Christian
principles.Like Tolstoi she taught the absolute wickedness of fighting,
instead of the manly duty of self-defense.And yet, I think my brothers
suffered no evil consequences.Perhaps the secret of her
great influence over us was that she demanded the absolute truth.Dishonesty in word or act was out of the question.In two instances, I
remember, I lied to her; for in moral strength I was not the equal of
George Washington.But those lies weighed heavily on my conscience, till
at last, after many years, I confessed to her.If she demanded truth and obedience from her sons, she gave to them her
absolute devotion.Miracles of healing were performed in her household.By sheer force of character, by continual watchings and utmost care in
dieting, she rescued me from a hopeless case of dysentery in the fifth
year of my age.The old Navy doctor called it a miracle, and so it was.Serious sickness was uncommon in
our family, as is illustrated by the fact that, for periods of three
years each, not one of her four boys was ever late to school, though the
distance thither was a mile or two.When Percival, coasting down one of
the steep hills of Georgetown, ran into a street car and was brought
home half stunned, with one front tooth knocked out and gone and another
badly loosened, Angeline Hall repaired to the scene of the accident
early the next morning, found the missing tooth, and had the family
dentist restore it to its place.There it has done good service for
twenty years.Is it any wonder that such a woman should have insisted
upon her husband’s discovering the satellites of Mars?Perhaps the secret of success in the moral training of her sons lay in
her generalship.In house and yard there was
work to do, and she marshaled her boys to do it.Like a good general she
was far more efficient than any of her soldiers, but under her
leadership they did wonders.Sweeping, dusting, making beds, washing
dishes, sifting ashes, going to market, running errands, weeding the
garden, chopping wood, beating carpets, mending fences, cleaning
house—there was hardly a piece of work indoors or out with which they
were unfamiliar.There was abundance
of leisure for all sorts of diversions, including swimming and skating,
two forms of exercise which struck terror to the mother heart, but in
which, through her self-sacrifice, they indulged quite freely.Their leisure was purchased by her labor; for until they were of
academic age she was their school teacher.In an hour or two a day they
mastered the three R’s and many things besides.Nor did they suffer from
too little teaching, for at the preparatory school each of them in turn
led his class, and at Harvard College all four sons graduated with
distinction.How few mothers have so
proud a record, and how impossible would such an achievement have seemed
to any observer who had seen the collapse of this frail woman at
McGrawville!But as each successive son completed his college course it
was as if she herself had done it—her moral training had supplied the
incentive, her teaching and encouragement had started the lad in his
studies, when he went to school her motherly care had provided
nourishing food and warm clothing, when he went to college her frugality
had saved up the necessary money.She used to say, “Somebody has got to
make a sacrifice,” and she sacrificed herself.It is good to know that
on Christmas Day, 1891, half a year before she died, she broke bread
with husband and all four sons at the old Georgetown home.Let it not be supposed that Angeline Hall reached the perfection of
motherhood.The Gay Street home was the embodiment
of her spirit; and as she was a Puritan, her sons suffered sometimes
from her excess of Puritanism.They neither drank nor used tobacco; but
fortunately their father taught them to play cards.Their mother brought
them up to believe in woman suffrage; but fortunately Cupid provided
them wives regardless of such creed.She taught them to eschew pride,
sending them to gather leaves in the streets, covering their garments
with patches, discouraging the use of razors on incipient beards; but
fortunately a boy’s companions take such nonsense out of him.She even
left a case of chills and fever to the misdirected mercies of a woman
doctor, a homœopathist.I myself was the victim, and for twenty-five
years I have abhorred women homœopathic physicians.But such trivial faults are not to be compared with the depths of a
mother’s love.To all that is intrinsically noble and beautiful she was
keenly sensitive.How good it was to see her exult in the glories of a
Maryland sunset—viewed from the housetop with her boys about her.And
how strange that this timid woman could allow them to risk their
precious necks on the roof of a three-story house!Perhaps her passion for the beautiful was most strikingly displayed in
the cultivation of her garden.To each son she dedicated a rose-bush.There was one for her husband and another for his mother.In a shady
part of the yard grew lilies of the valley; and gladiolas, Easter lilies
and other varieties of lilies were scattered here and there.In the
early spring there were crocuses and hyacinths and daffodils.Vines
trailed along the fences and climbed the sides of the house.She was
especially fond of her English ivy.Honeysuckles flourished, hollyhocks
ran riot even in the front yard, morning-glories blossomed west of the
house, by the front porch grew a sweet-briar rose with its fragrant
leaves, and by the bay windows bloomed blue and white wisterias.A
magnolia bush stood near the parlor window, a forsythia by the front
fence, and by the side alley a beautiful flowering bush with a dome of
white blossoms.The flower beds were literally crowded, so that humming
birds, in their gorgeous plumage, were frequent visitors.Hall had loved the wild flowers of her native woods and fields; and
in the woods back of Georgetown she sought out her old friends and
brought them home to take root in her yard, coaxing their growth with
rich wood’s earth, found in the decayed stump of some old tree.Thus the following poem, like all her poems, was but the expression of
herself:

                              ASPIRATION.The violet dreams forever of the sky,
            Until at last she wakens wondrous fair,
          With heaven’s own azure in her dewy eye,
            And heaven’s own fragrance in her earthly air.The lily folds close in her heart the beams
            That the pure stars reach to her deeps below,
          Till o’er the waves her answering brightness gleams—
            A star hath flowered within her breast of snow.The rose that watches at the gates of morn,
            While pours through heaven the splendor of the sun,
          Needs none to tell us whence her strength is born,
            Nor where her crown of glory she hath won.And every flower that blooms on hill or plain
            In the dull soil hath most divinely wrought
          To haunting perfume or to heavenly stain
            The sweetness born of her aspiring thought.With what expectancy we wait the hour
          When all the hopes to which thou dost aspire
            Shall in the holiness of beauty flower.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XV.––––––
                           AN AMERICAN WOMAN.The desire of knowledge is a powerful instinct of the soul, as
    inherent in woman as in man.... It was designed to be gratified, all
    the avenues of her soul are open for its gratification.Her every
    sense is as perfect as man’s: her hand is as delicate in its touch,
    her ear as acute in hearing, her eye the same in its wonderful
    mechanism, her brain sends out the same two-fold telegraphic
    network.She is endowed with the same consciousness, the same power
    of perception.From her
    very organization she is manifestly formed for the pursuit of the
    same knowledge, for the attainment of the same virtue, for the
    unfolding of the same truth.Whatever aids man in the pursuit of any
    one of these objects must aid her also.Let woman then reject the
    philosophy of a narrow prejudice or of false custom, and trust
    implicitly to God’s glorious handwriting on every folded tissue of
    her body, on every tablet of her soul.Let her seek for the highest
    culture of brain and heart.Let her apply her talent to the highest
    use.In so doing will the harmony of her being be perfect.Brain and
    heart according well will make one music.All the bright
    intellections of the mind, all the beautiful affections of the heart
    will together form one perfect crystal around the pole of Truth.From these words of hers it appears that Angeline Hall believed in a
well-rounded life for women as well as for men; and to the best of her
ability she lived up to her creed.Physically deficient herself, she
heralded the advent of the American woman—the peer of Spartan mother,
Roman matron or modern European dame.Her ideal could hardly be called
“the new woman,” for she fulfilled the duties of wife and mother with
the utmost devotion.Among college women she was a pioneer; and perhaps
the best type of college woman corresponds to her ideal.[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF 1878]


In person she was not remarkable—height about five feet three inches,
weight with clothing about one hundred and twenty-three pounds.In
middle life she was considerably bent over, more from years of toil than
from physical weakness.Nervous strength was lacking; and early in life
she lost her teeth.But her frame was well developed, her waist being as
large as a Greek goddess’s, for she scorned the use of corsets.Her
smooth skin was of fine stout texture.Her well-shaped head was adorned
by thin curls of wonderfully fine, dark hair, which even at the time of
death showed hardly a trace of white.Straight mouth, high forehead,
strong brow, large straight nose, and beautiful brown eyes indicated a
woman of great spiritual force.She cared little for adornment, believing that the person is attractive
if the soul is good.Timid in the face of physical danger, she was
endowed with great moral courage and invincible resolution.She used to
speak of “going along and doing something,” and of “doing a little every
day.” Friends and relatives found in her a wise counsellor and fearless
leader.She was gifted with intellect of a high order—an unquenchable
thirst for knowledge, a good memory, excellent mathematical ability, and
the capacity for mental labor.But her sense of duty controlled, and she
devoted her talents to the service of others.Unlike Lady Macbeth in other respects, she was suited to bear
men-children.And, thanks to her true womanhood, she nursed them at the
breast.There were no bottle babies in the Hall family.Tradition has it
that she endured the pains of childbirth with unusual fortitude, hardly
needing a physician.But this seeming strength was due in part to an
unwise modesty.With hardly enough strength for the duties of each day, she did work
enough for two women through sheer force of will.It is not surprising
then that she died, in the sixty-second year of her age, from a stroke
of apoplexy.She was by no means apoplectic in appearance, being rather
a pale person; but the blood-vessels of the brain were worn out and
could no longer withstand the pressure.In the fall of 1881, after the
death of her sister Mary and of Nellie Woodward, daughter of her sister
Ruth, she was the victim of a serious sickness, which continued for six
months or more.Friends thought she would die; but her sister Ruth came
and took care of her, and saved her for ten more years of usefulness.She lived to see her youngest son through college, attended his Class
Day, and died a few days after his graduation.The motive power of her life was religious faith—a faith that outgrew
all forms of superstition.Brought up to accept the narrow theology of
her mother’s church, she became a Unitarian.The eldest son was sent
regularly to the Unitarian Sunday School in Washington; but a quarrel
arising in the church, she quietly withdrew, and thereafter assumed the
whole responsibility of training her sons in Christian morals.Subsequently she took a keen interest in the Concord School of
Philosophy; and, adopting her husband’s view, she looked to science for
the regeneration of mankind.In this she was not altogether wise, for
her own experience had proven that the advancement of knowledge depends
upon a divine enthusiasm, which must be fed by a religion of some sort.Fortunately, she was possessed of a poetic soul, and she never lost
religious feeling.The following poem illustrates very well the faith of her later life:

                              TO SCIENCE.I.

         Friend of our race, O Science, strong and wise!Though thou wast scorned and wronged and sorely tried,
         Bound and imprisoned, racked and crucified,
         Thou dost in life invulnerable rise
         The glorious leader ’gainst our enemies.Thou art Truth’s champion for the domain wide
         Ye twain shall conquer fighting side by side.Thus thou art strong, and able thou to cope
         With all thy enemies that yet remain.They fly already from the open plain,
         And climb, hard-pressed, far up the rugged <DW72>.We hear thy bugle sound o’er land and sea
         And know that victory abides with thee.Because thou’st conquered all _one_ little world
           Thou never like the ancient king dost weep,
           But like the brave Ulysses, on the deep
           Dost launch thy bark, and, all its sails unfurled,
           Dost search for new worlds which may lie impearled
           By happy islands where the billows sleep;
           Or into sunless seas dost fearless sweep,
           Braving the tempest which is round thee hurled;
           Or, bolder still, mounting where far stars shine,
           From conquest unto conquest thou dost rise
           And hold’st dominion over realms divine,
           Where, clear defined unto thy piercing eyes,
           And fairer than Faith’s yearnful heart did ween
           Stretches the vastness of the great Unseen.E’en where thy sight doth fail thou givest not o’er,
          But still “beyond the red” thy spectraphone
          The ray invisible transforms to tone,
          Thus winning from the silence more and more;
          Wherein thou buildest new worlds from shore to shore
          With hills perpetual and with mountains lone;
          To music moving pond’rous stone on stone
          As unto Orpheus’ lyre they moved of yore.Beyond the farthest sweep of farthest sun,
          Beyond the music of the sounding spheres
          Which chant the measures of the months and years,
          Toward realms that e’en to daring Thought are new
          Still let thy flying feet unwearied run.let her not deem thee foe,
           Though thou dost drive her from the Paradise
           To which she clings with backward turning eyes,
           Thou art her angel still, and biddest her go
           To wider lands where the great rivers flow,
           And broad and green many a valley lies,
           Where high and grand th’ eternal mountains rise,
           And oceans fathomless surge to and fro.Thus thou dost teach her that God’s true and real,
           Fairer and grander than her dreams _must_ be;
           Till she shall leave the realm of the Ideal
           To follow Truth throughout the world with thee,
           Through earth and sea and up beyond the sun
           Until the mystery of God is won.Whatever the literary defects, these are noble sonnets.But I had rather
take my chances in a good Unitarian church than try to nourish the soul
with such Platonic love of God.She disliked the Unitarian habit of
clinging to church traditions and ancient forms of worship; but better
these than the materialism of a scientific age.She was absolutely loyal to truth, not
guilty of that shuffling attitude of modern theologians who have
outgrown the superstition of Old Testament only to cling more
tenaciously to the superstition of the New.In the Concord School of
Philosophy, and later in her studies as a member of the Ladies’
Historical Society of Washington, she was searching for the new faith
that should fulfil the old.It might be of interest here to introduce
selections from some of her Historical Society essays, into the
composition of which she entered with great earnestness.Written toward
the close of life, they still retain the freshness and unspoiled
enthusiasm of youth.One specimen must suffice:

    In thinking of Galileo, and the office of the telescope, which is to
    give us increase of light, and of the increasing power of the larger
    and larger lenses, which widens our horizon to infinity, this
    constantly recurring thought comes to me: how shall we grow into the
    immensity that is opening before us?The principle of light pervades
    all space—it travels from star to star and makes known to us all
    objects on earth and in heaven.The great ether throbs and thrills
    with its burden to the remotest star as with a joy.Sandra went to the garden.But there is
    also an all-pervading force, so subtle that we know not yet how it
    passes through the illimitable space.But before it all worlds fall
    into divine order and harmony.It imparts the
    power of one to all, and gathers from all for the one.What in the
    soul answers to these two principles is, first, also light or
    knowledge, by which all things are unveiled; the other which answers
    to gravitation, and before which all shall come into proper
    relations, and into the heavenly harmony, and by which we shall fill
    the heavens with ourselves, and ourselves with heaven, is love.But after all, Angeline Hall gave
herself to duty and not to philosophy—to the plain, monotonous work of
home and neighborhood.Like the virtuous woman of Scripture, she
supplied with her own hands the various family wants—cooked with great
skill, canned abundance of fruit for winter, and supplied the table from
day to day with plain, wholesome food.Would that she might have taught
Bostonians to bake beans!If they would try her method, they would
discover that a mutton bone is an excellent substitute for pork.Pork
and lard she banished from her kitchen.Beef suet is, indeed, much
cleaner.The chief article of diet was meat, for Mrs.Hall was no
vegetarian, and the Georgetown markets supplied the best of Virginia
beef and mutton.Like the virtuous woman of Scripture, she provided the
family with warm clothing, and kept it in repair.A large part of her
life was literally spent in mending clothes.She never relaxed the rigid
economy of Cambridge days.She commonly needed but one servant, for she
worked with her own hands and taught her sons to help her.The house was
always substantially clean from roof to cellar.Nowhere on the whole premises was a bad smell tolerated.While family wants were scrupulously attended to, she stretched forth a
hand to the poor.The Civil War filled Washington with <DW64>s, and for
several winters Mrs.In
1872 she was “Directress” of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth wards; and
for a long time she was a member of a benevolent society in Georgetown,
having charge of a section of the city near her residence.For the last
fourteen years of her life, she visited the Home for Destitute <DW52>
Women and Children in north Washington.Her poor <DW52> neighbors
regarded her with much esteem.She listened to their stories of
distress, comforted them, advised them.The aged she admitted to her
warm kitchen; and they went away, victuals in their baskets or coins in
their hands, with the sense of having a friend in Mrs.Uncle
Louis, said to be one hundred and fourteen years old, rewarded her with
a grape-vine, which was planted by the dining room window.And “the
Uncle Louis grape” was the best in the garden.At the close of the Civil War she even undertook to redeem two fallen
Irish women by taking them into her house to work.But their appetite
for whiskey was too strong, and they would steal butter, barter it for
liquor, and come home drunk.On one occasion one of these women took
little Asaph along to visit the saloon; and there his mother found him,
with the servant standing by joking with rough men, her dress in shreds.Hall had no time or strength for such charitable enterprises, and
soon abandoned them.She was saved from most of the follies of
philanthropy by the good sense of her husband, whom she rewarded with
the devotion of a faithful wife.His studies and researches, almost from
the first, were much too deep for her entire comprehension, but she was
always enthusiastic about his work.In the introduction to his
“_Observations and Orbits of the Satellites of Mars_,” Professor Hall
chivalrously says:

    In the spring of 1877, the approaching favorable opposition of the
    planet Mars attracted my attention, and the idea occurred to me of
    making a careful search with our large Clark refractor for a
    satellite of this planet.An examination of the literature of the
    planet showed, however, such a mass of observations of various
    kinds, made by the most experienced and skillful astronomers that
    the chance of finding a satellite appeared to be very slight, so
    that I might have abandoned the search had it not been for the
    encouragement of my wife.Each night she sent her
husband to the observatory supplied with a nourishing lunch, and each
night she awaited developments with eager interest.I can well remember
the excitement at home.There was a great secret in the house, and all
the members of the family were drawn more closely together by mutual
confidence.The moral and intellectual training of her sons has already been
referred to.Summer vacations were often spent with her sisters in
Rodman, N.Y.Her mother, who reached the age of eighty years, died in
the summer of 1878, when Mrs.Hall became the head of the Stickney
family.Her sisters Mary and Elmina were childless.Ruth had six
children, in whose welfare their Aunt Angeline took a lively interest.The three girls each spent a winter with her in Washington, and when, in
the summer of 1881, Nellie was seized with a fatal illness, Aunt
Angeline was present to care for her.Now and then Charlotte Ingalls,
who had prospered in Wisconsin, would come on from the West, and the
Stickney sisters would all be together.The last reunion occurred in the
summer of 1891, a year previous to Angeline’s death.It was a goodly
sight to see the sisters in one wagon, near the old home place; and
when, at Elmina’s house, Angeline was bustling about attending to the
needs of the united family, it was good to hear Charlotte exclaim, “Take
care, old lady!” She was thirteen years older than Angeline, and seemed
almost to belong to an earlier generation.She remembered her father
well, and had no doubt acquired from him some of the ancient New
Hampshire customs lost to her younger sisters.Certainly her
exclamations of “Fiddlesticks,” and “Witch-cats,” were quaint and
picturesque.But it was Angeline who was really best versed in the family history.She had made a study of it, in all its branches, and could trace her
descent from at least eleven worthy Englishmen, most of whom arrived in
New England before 1650.She made excursions to various points in New
England in search of relatives.At Belchertown, Mass., in 1884, she
found her grandfather Cook’s first cousin, Mr.He was then
one hundred years old, and remembered how in boyhood he used to go
skating with Elisha Cook.How brief the history of America in the presence of such a man!I
remember seeing an old New Englander, as late as 1900, who as a boy of
eleven years had seen General Lafayette.It was a treat to hear him
describe the courteous Frenchman, slight of stature, bent with age, but
active and polite enough to alight from the stage-coach to shake hands
with the people assembled to welcome him in the little village of
Charlton, Mass.At the close of life she longed to
visit Europe, but death intervened, and her days were spent in her
native country.She passed two summers in the mountains of Virginia.In
1878, with her little son Percival, she accompanied her husband to
Colorado, to observe the total eclipse of the sun.Three years before
they had taken the whole family to visit her sister Charlotte’s people
in Wisconsin.It was through her family loyalty that she acquired the Adirondack
habit.In the summer of 1882, after the severe sickness of the preceding
winter, she was staying with a cousin’s son, a country doctor, in
Washington County, N.Y.He proposed an outing in the invigorating air of
the Adirondacks.And so, with her three youngest sons and the doctor’s
family, she drove to Indian Lake, and camped there about a week.Her
improvement was so marked that the next summer, accompanied by three
sons and her sister Ruth, she drove into the wilderness from the West,
camping a few days in a log cabin by the side of Piseco Lake.In 1885,
setting out from Rodman again, she drove four hundred miles, passing
north of the mountains to Paul Smith’s, and thence to Saranac Lake
village, John Brown’s farm, Keene Valley, and Lake George, and returning
by way of the Mohawk Valley.In 1888 she camped with the three youngest
sons on Lower Saranac, and in 1890 she spent July and August at the
summer school of Thomas Davidson, on the side of Mt.One day
I escorted her and her friend Miss Sarah Waitt to the top of the
mountain, four or five miles distant, and we spent the night on the
summit before a blazing camp-fire.Two years later she was planning
another Adirondack trip when death overtook her—at the house of her
friend Mrs.Berrien, at North Andover, Mass., July 3, 1892.Her poem “Heracles,” written towards the close of her career, fittingly
describes her own herculean labors:

                               HERACLES.I.

           Genius of labor, mighty Heracles!Though bound by fate to do another’s will,
           Not basely, as a slave, dost thou fulfil
           The appointed task.The eye of God to please
           Thou seekest, and man to bless, and not thy ease.So to thy wearying toil thou addest still
           New labors, to redeem some soul from ill,
           Performing all thy generous mind conceives.From the sea-monster’s jaws thy arm did free,
           And from her chains, the fair Hesione.And when Alcestis, who her lord to save,
           Her life instead a sacrifice she gave,
           Then wast thou near with heart that never quailed,
           And o’er Death’s fearful form thy might prevailed.Because thou chosest virtue, when for thee
            Vice her alluring charms around thee spread,
            The gods, approving, smiled from overhead,
            And gave to thee thy shining panoply.Nature obedient to thy will was led,
            Out rushed the rivers from their ancient bed
            And washed the filth of earth into the sea.When ’gainst thy foes thy arrows all were spent,
            Zeus stones instead, in whirling snow-cloud sent.When with sore heat oppressed, O wearied one!Thou thought’st to aim thy arrows at the sun,
            Then Helios sent his golden boat to thee
            To bear thee safely through the trackless sea.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XVI.––––––
                          A BUNDLE OF LETTERS.The letters of Angeline Hall are genuine letters—not meant for
publication, but for the eyes of the persons addressed.The style, even
the spelling and punctuation, are faulty; and the subject-matter in most
cases can have no general interest.However, I have selected a few of
her letters, which I trust will be readable, and which may help to give
a truer conception of the astronomer’s wife:

                                                   RODMAN, July 26, ’66.DEAREST ASAPH: I am at Mother’s this morning.Staid over to help see
    to Ruth, and now cannot get back over to Elminas, all so busy at
    their work, have no time to carry me, then Franklin is sick half the
    time.I shall probably get over there in a day or two.I have had no
    letters from you since a week ago last night, have had no
    opportunity to send to the Office.Franklin has finished his haying but
    has a little hoing to do yet—Constant is trying to get his work
    along so that he will be ready to take you around when you come.He
    wishes you to write when you will come so that he can arrange his
    work accordingly.I hope you will come by the middle of August.He thinks you
    have forsaken him.When I ask him now where is papa, he says “no
    papa.” I have weaned him.He stayed with Aunt Mary three nights
    while I was taking care of Ruth.He eats his bread and milk very
    well now.Little “A” has been a very good boy indeed, a real little
    man.I bought him and Homer some nice bows and arrows of an Indian
    who brought them into the cars to sell just this side of Rome, so
    that he shoots at a mark with Grandfather Woodward.I suppose Adelaide starts for Goshen next week.I have received two
    letters from her.Now do come up here as soon as you can.I do not enjoy my visit half
    so well without you.I am going out with Mary after raspberries this
    morning—Little Samie is very fond of them.Affectionately

                ANGELINE HALL.28 (1868)

    DEAR SISTER MARY, Little Angelo is only twelve days old, but he is
    as bright and smart as can be.I have washed and dressed him for
    four days myself.I have been down to the gate to-day.And have
    sewed most all day, so you see I am pretty well.To day is Samie’s birthday, four years old—he is quite well and
    happy—The baby he says is his.I should like very much to take a peep at you in
    your new home.We like our old place better and
    better all the time.You must write to me as soon as you can.Do you
    get your mail at Adams Centre?Have you any apples in that vicinity
    this year?Hall has just been reading in the newspaper a sketch of Henry
    Keep’s life which says he was once in the Jefferson Co.Poor house,
    is it true?Much love to you all

                ANGELINE HALL.GEORGETOWN March 3rd 1871

    DEAR SISTER MARY: We received your letter, also the tub of apples
    and cider.I have made some apple sauce, it is splendid.I have not
    had one bit of boiled cider apple sauce before since we came to
    Washington.I shall try to pay you for all your expense and trouble
    sometime.I would send you some fresh shad if I was sure it would
    keep to get to you.We had some shad salted last spring but it is
    not very nice.I think was not put up quite right, so it is hardly
    fit to send.Samie has had a little ear-ache this week but
    is better.Angelo is the nicest little boy you ever saw.A man came to spade the ground to sow
    our peas but it began to rain just as he got here, so we shall have
    to wait a few days.My crocuses and daffodils are budded to blossom,
    and the sweet-scented English violets are in bloom, filling the
    parlors here with fragrance.We
    do not have to wait for it, but before we are aware it is here.I think we shall make you a little visit this
    summer.How are Father and Mother and Constant and yourself?Much
    love to you all from all of us.Affectionately

                ANGELINE HALL.18th ’74

    DEAR SISTER MARY: I am getting very anxious to hear from you.Little
    “A” commenced a letter to you during his vacation, and copied those
    verses you sent so as to send the original back to you.But he did
    not finish his letter and I fear he will not have time to write
    again for some time as his studies take almost every minute he can
    spare from eating and sleeping.Baby grows smart
    and handsome all the time.Angelo keeps fat and rosy though we have to be careful of him.Samie
    is getting taller and taller, and can not find time to play enough.Mother Hall is with us this winter, is helping me about the sewing.You
    must dress warm so as not to take cold.Have you got any body to
    help you this winter?Has Salina gone to the
    music school?Must write to Elmina in a day or
    two.The baby thinks Granpa’s saw-man is the nicest thing he can find.Angelo is so choice of it he will not let him touch it often.Affectionately

                ANGELINE.GEORGETOWN March 22nd [1877 probably]

    DEAR SISTER MARY: We are working on our grounds some as the weather
    permits.It will be very pretty here when we get it done.And our
    house is as convenient as can be now.Tell Mother I have set out a
    rose bush for her, and am going to plant one for Grandma Hall too.Samie has improved a great deal the last year, he is getting stout
    and tall.Angelo is as fat as a pig and as keen as a knife.Percy is
    a real nice little boy, he has learned most of his letters.will go ahead of his Father yet if he keeps his health.I never
    saw a boy of his age study as he does, every thing must be right,
    and be understood before he will go an inch.I am pretty well, but have to be careful, if I get sick a little am
    sure to have a little malarial fever.Much love to you all and write soon telling me how Mother is.Affectionately

                ANGELINE HALL.13th 1881

    DEAR ASAPH, Yesterday we buried Nellie over in the cemetery on
    Grandfather’s old farm in Rodman.You can not think how beautiful
    and grand she looked.She had improved very much since she was at
    our house, and I see she had many friends.I think she was a
    superior girl, but too sensitive and ambitious to live in this world
    so cramped and hedged about.She went down to help Mary, and Mr.Wright’s people came for her to go up and help them as Mrs.Wright
    was sick, so Nellie went up there and washed and worked very hard
    and came back to Mary’s completely exhausted, and I think she had a
    congestive chill to begin with and another when she died.The little boys and I are at Elminas.I came over to rest a little,
    am about used up.One of the neighbors has just come over saying
    that Mary died last night at nine o’clock, and will be buried
    to-morrow.So to-morrow morning I suppose I shall go back over to
    Constant’s, do not know how long I shall stay there.I wish to know how you are getting on at home.With Much Love

                C. A. S. HALL.I do not know whether I had better go home, or try to stay
    here and rest, I am so miserably tired.THE OLD BRICK, GOSHEN
                                     9 A.M.Monday Morning July 14, 1884

    DEAR ASAPH: I have just got through the morning’s work.Got up at
    half past five, built the fire, got the breakfast which consisted of
    cold roast beef, baked potatoes, Graham gems, and raspberries and
    cream.Percie got up with me and went for the berries, Angelo went over to
    his Uncle Lyman’s for the milk and cream, and Samie went out into
    the garden to work.After breakfast
    all the boys went to the garden, Samie and Percie to kill potato
    bugs and Angelo to pick the peas for dinner.Samie has just come in
    to his lessons.Angelo is not quite through, Percie is done.I have
    washed the dishes and done the chamber work.Now I have some mending
    and a little ironing to do.I have done our washing so far a little
    at a time.I washed some Saturday so I have the start of the common
    washer-women and iron Monday.I suppose at home you have got
    somebody to wait on you all round, and then find it hard work to
    live.I have mastered the situation here, though it has been very
    hard for two weeks, and have got things clean and comfortable.The old brick and mortar though, fall down freely whenever one
    raises or shuts a window, or when the wind slams a door, as it often
    does here in this country of wind.It was showery Friday and Saturday afternoon
    and some of his hay got wet.Next month Lyman is to take the superintendency of the Torrington
    creamery much to the discomfiture of Mary.[Professor Hall’s brother
    Lyman married Mary Gilman, daughter of Mrs.He made
    no arrangements as to stated salary.Mary is trying to have that
    fixed and I hope she will.I think he had better come up here and stay with
    us awhile if his health does not improve very soon.Adelaide is staying with Dine during her vacation, they both came up
    here last Tuesday, stayed to dinner, brought little Mary.I have not
    seen Mary Humphrey yet.[Adelaide and Adeline, twins, and Mary
    Humphrey were Professor Hall’s sisters.]But the boys saw her the
    Fourth.Affectionately

                C. A. S. HALL.I do not think best for A. to go to Pulkowa.17th 1887

    MY DEAR BOYS [Samuel and Angelo at college] We received Angelo’s
    letter the first of the week and were very glad to get such a nice
    long letter and learn how strong you were both growing.I left for New Haven two weeks ago this morning; had a pleasant
    journey.I had a room on Wall street not far
    from the College buildings, so it was a long way to the Observatory
    and I did not get up to the Observatory till Sunday afternoon, as A.
    wanted to sleep in the mornings.Friday A. drove me up to East Rock,
    which overlooks the city, the sea and the surrounding country.Elkins and after tea, a
    pleasant little party gathered there.Newton came and
    took me to hear President Dwight preach, in the afternoon A. and I
    went to Mrs.Winchesters to see the beautiful flowers in the green
    houses, then we went to Prof.Marshes, after which we went to Miss
    Twinings to tea then to Prof.Monday I went up to the
    Observatory and mended a little for A. then went to Dr.Leighton’s
    to tea and afterwards to a party at Mrs.I forgot to
    say that Monday morning Mrs.Wright came for me and we went through
    Prof.Wright’s physical Laboratory, then to the top of the Insurance
    building with Prof.Newton to get a view of the city.Tuesday
    morning I went up to the Observatory again and mended a little more
    for A., then went down to dinner and at about half past two left for
    New York where I arrived just before dark, went to the Murray Hill
    Hotel, got up into the hall on the way to my room and there met Dr.Peters, who said that father was around somewhere, after awhile he
    came.Wednesday I went to the meeting of the Academy.Draper gave a
    supper, and before supper Prof.Pickering read a paper on his
    spectroscopic work with the Draper fund, and showed pictures of the
    Harvard Observatory, and of the spectra of stars etc.Thursday it rained all day, but I went to the Academy meeting.Friday a number of the members of the Academy together with Mrs.Draper and myself went over to Llewellyn Park to
    see Edison’s new phonograph.Saturday morning your father and I went to the museum and saw the
    statuary and paintings there, and left Jersey City about 2 P.M.for
    home, where we arrived at about half past eight: We had a pleasant
    time, but were rather tired.Percie and all are well as usual.Aunt
    Charlotte is a great deal better.Aunt Ruth has not gone to
    Wisconsin.I guess she will
    send some of it to Homer to come home with.Jasper has left home
    again said he was going to Syracuse.Aunt Ruth has trouble enough,
    says she has been over to Elmina’s, and David does not get up till
    breakfast time leaving E. to do all the chores I suppose.She writes
    that Leffert Eastman’s wife is dead, and their neighbor Mr.Now I must close my diary or I shall not get it into the office
    to-night.I am putting down carpets and am very busy

            With love

                C. A. S. HALL.12th ’88

    MY DEAR ANGELO AND PERCIVAL [at college],... Sam.is reading
    Goethe’s Faust aloud to me when I can sit down to sew, and perhaps I
    told you that he is helping me to get things together for my
    Prometheus Unbound.He is translating now Aeschylos’ fragments for I
    wish to know as far as possible how Aeschylos treated the subject.I
    have a plan all my own which I think a good one, and have made a
    beginning.I know I shall have to work hard if I write any thing
    good, but am willing to work.On the next day after
    Thanksgiving our Historical Society begins its work.With love

                C. A. S. HALL.8th, 1890

    MY DEAR BOYS [Angelo and Percival], I arrived here safely early this
    afternoon.Miss Waitt and I had a very pleasant drive on Thursday.Stopped at the John Brown place for
    lunch, then drove over to Lake Placid, we went up to the top of the
    tower at Grand View House and had a good look at the mountains and
    the lake as far as we could see it there.Then we passed on to
    Wilmington Notch which I think much finer than any mountain pass
    which I have before seen.We went on to Wilmington and stayed over
    night.There was a hard shower before breakfast, but the rain
    stopped in time for the renewal of our journey.We arrived at Au
    Sable Chasm a little after noon on Saturday.The Chasm is very
    picturesque but not so grand as the Wilmington Pass.We saw the
    falls in the Au Sable near the Pass; there are several other falls
    before the river reaches the Chasm.From the Chasm we went on to
    Port Kent where Miss Waitt took the steamer for Burlington, and
    where I stayed over night.In the morning I took the steamer for
    Ticonderoga.We plunged into a fog which shut out all view till we
    neared Burlington, when it lifted a little.After a while it nearly
    all went away, and I had a farewell look of the mountains as we
    passed.It began to rain before we reached Ticonderoga but we got a
    very good view of the old Fort.I thought of Asaph Hall the first,
    and old Ethan Allen, and of your great great grandfather David Hall
    whose bones lie in an unknown grave somewhere in the vicinity.The steamer goes south only to Ticonderoga; and there I took the
    cars for Whitehall where I found my cousin Elizabeth Benjamin
    seemingly most happy to see me.She is an intelligent woman though
    she has had very little opportunity for book learning.She has a
    fine looking son at Whitehall.It will soon be time for you to leave Keene.I think it would be
    well for you to pack your tent the day before you go if you can
    sleep one night in the large tent.Of course the tent should be dry
    when it is packed if possible, otherwise you will have to dry it
    after you get to Cambridge.Remember to take all the things out of
    my room there.The essence of peppermint set near the west window.They are all well here at the Borsts.I shall go up to Aunt Elmina’s this week.Love to all,

                C. A. S. HALL.2715 N Street [same as 18 Gay St]
                                         WASHINGTON D.C.March 28th 1891

    MY DEAR BOYS [Angelo and Percival at college],... I am sorry the
    Boston girl is getting to be so helpless.I think all who have to
    keep some one to take care of them had better leave for Europe on
    the first steamer.I think co-education would be a great help to both boys and girls.I
    have never liked schools for girls alone since Harriette Lewis and
    Antoinette McLain went to Pittsfield to the Young Ladies Institute.Stanton’s advice to her sons, “When
    you marry do choose a woman with a spine and sound teeth.” Now I
    think a woman needs two kinds of good back-bone.As for Astronomical work, and all kinds of scientific work, there
    may not be the pressing need there was for it a few centuries ago;
    but I think our modern theory of progress is nearly right as
    described by Taine, “as that which founds all our aspirations on the
    boundless advance of the sciences, on the increase of comforts which
    their applied discoveries constantly bring to the human condition,
    and on the increase of good sense which their discoveries,
    popularized, slowly deposit in the human brain.” Of course Ethical
    teaching must keep pace.It is well to keep the teaching of the
    Prometheus Bound in mind, that merely material civilization is not
    enough; and must not stand alone.But the knowledge that we get from
    all science, that effects follow causes always, will teach perhaps
    just as effectively as other preaching.This makes me think of the pleasant time Sam and I had when he was
    home last, reading George Eliot’s Romola.This work is really a
    great drama, and I am much impressed with the power of it.I would say _Philosophy_ AND Science now and forever one and
    inseparable....

            With much love

                C. A. S. HALL.June 10th ’92

    MY DEAR PERCIVAL [at college], Your father has just got home from
    Madison.He says you can go to see the boat-race if you wish to.says perhaps he will go, when are the tickets to be sold, he
    says, on the train that follows the race?He thinks perhaps he would
    like two tickets.He
    thought you had better sell to the Fays the bureau, bedstead,
    chairs, etc.and that you send home the revolving bookcase, the desk
    and hair mattress; and such of the bedclothes as you wish to carry
    to the mountains of course you will keep, but I expect to go up
    there and will look over the bedclothes with you, there may be some
    to send home.Now I suppose you are to keep your room so that our friends can see
    the exercises around the tree on Class-day, I wish Mr.King
    to come and Mr.Will you write to them or shall I
    write?I expect to go up on Wednesday the 22nd so as to get a little rested
    before Class-day.I intend to go over to stay with Mrs.Berrien at
    North Andover between Class-day and Commencement.We have just received an invitation to Carrie Clark’s wedding.An invitation came from Theodore Smith to Father and me, but father
    says he will not go.With love

                  C. A. S. HALL.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                             CHAPTER XVII.––––––
                       AUGUSTA LARNED’S TRIBUTE.The following tribute was written by Miss Augusta Larned, and published
in the _Christian Register_ of July 28, 1892:

    There is one master link in the family bond, as there is one
    keystone in the arch.Often we know not its binding power until it
    is taken away.Then the home begins to crumble and fall into
    confusion, and the distinct atoms, like beads from a broken string,
    roll off into distant corners.We turn our thoughts to one who made
    the ideal home, pervaded it, filled its every part like air and
    sunshine coming in at open windows, as unobtrusive as gentle.A
    spiritual attraction drew all to this centre.It was not what she
    said or did; it was what she was that inclined footsteps to her
    door.Those who once felt that subtle, penetrating sweetness felt
    they must return to bask in it again and again.So she never lost
    friends by a loss more pathetic than death.There were no
    dislocations in her life.The good she did seemed to enter the pores of the spirit, and to
    uplift in unknown ways the poor degraded ideal of our lives.The
    secret of her help was not exuberance, but stillness and rest.Ever
    more and more the beautiful secret eluded analysis.It shone out of
    her eyes.It lingered in the lovely smile that irradiated her face,
    and made every touch and tone a benediction.Even the dullest
    perception must have seen that her life was spiritual, based on
    unselfishness and charity.Beside her thoughtfulness and tender care
    all other kinds of self-abnegation seemed poor.She lived in the
    higher range of being.The purity of her face and the clearness of
    her eyes was a rebuke to all low motives.But no word of criticism
    fell from her lips.She was ready to take into her all-embracing
    tenderness those whom others disliked and shunned.Her gentle nature
    found a thousand excuses for their faults.Life had been hard with
    them; and, for this reason, she must be lenient.The good in each
    soul was always present to her perceptions.She reverenced it even
    in its evil admixture as a manifestation of the divine.She shunned the smallest witticism at another’s expense, lest she
    should pain or soil that pure inner mirror of conscience by an
    exaggeration.To the poor
    and despised she never condescended, but poured out her love and
    charity as the woman of Scripture broke the box of precious ointment
    to anoint the Master’s feet.All human beings received their due
    meed of appreciation at her hands.She disregarded the conventional
    limits a false social order has set up, shunning this one and
    honoring that one, because of externals.She was not afraid of
    losing her place in society by knowing the wrong people.She went
    her way with a strange unworldliness through all the prickly hedges,
    daring to be true to her own nature.She drew no arbitrary lines
    between human beings.The rich
    were not welcome for their riches, nor the poor for their poverty;
    but all were welcome for their humanity.Her door was as the door of a shrine because the fair amenities were
    always found within.Hospitality to her was as sacred as the hearth
    altar to the ancients.If she had not money to give the mendicant,
    she gave that something infinitely better,—the touch of human
    kinship.Many came for the dole she had to bestow, the secret
    charity that was not taken from her superfluity, but from her need.Her lowliness of heart was like that of a little child.How could a
    stranger suspect that she was a deep and profound student?Her
    researches had led her to the largest, most liberal faith in God and
    the soul and the spirit of Christ incarnate in humanity.The study
    of nature, to which she was devoted, showed her no irreconcilable
    break between science and religion.She could follow the boldest
    flights of the speculative spirit or face the last analysis of the
    physicist, while she clung to God and the witness of her own being.She aimed at an all-round culture, that one part of her nature might
    not be dwarfed by over-balance and disproportion.But it was the high thinking that went on with the daily doing of
    common duties that made her life so exceptional.A scholar in the
    higher realms of knowledge, a thinker, a seeker after truth, but,
    above all, the mother, the wife, the bread-giver to the household.It was a great privilege to know this woman who aped not others’
    fashions, who had better and higher laws to govern her life, who
    admitted no low motive in her daily walk, who made about her, as by
    a magician’s wand, a sacred circle, free from all gossip, envy,
    strife, and pettiness, who kept all bonds intact by constancy and
    undimmed affection, and has left a memory so sacred few can find
    words to express what she was to her friends.*       *       *       *       *

    But love and self-forgetfulness and tender service wear out the
    silver cord.It was fretted away silently, without complaint, the
    face growing ever more seraphic, at moments almost transparent with
    the shining of an inner light.One trembled to look on that
    spiritual beauty.Surely, the light of a near heaven was there.Silently, without complaint or murmur, she was preparing for the
    great change.Far-away thoughts lay mirrored in her clear, shining
    eyes.She had seen upon the mount the pattern of another life.Still
    no outward change in duty-doing, in tender care for others.Then one
    day she lay down and fell asleep like a little child on its mother’s
    breast, with the inscrutable smile on her lips.She who had been
    “mothering” everybody all her life long was at last gathered gently
    and painlessly into the Everlasting Arms.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                               EPILOGUE.An amber Adirondack river flows
               Down through the hills to blue Ontario;
               Along its banks the staunch rock-maple grows,
               And fields of wheat beneath the drifted snow.The summer sun, as if to quench his flame,
               Dips in the lake, and sinking disappears.Such was the land from which my mother came
               To college, questioning the future years;
               And through the Northern winter’s bitter gloom,
               Gilding the pane, her lamp of knowledge burned.The bride of Science she; and he the groom
               She wed; and they together loved and learned.And like Orion, hunting down the stars,
               He found and gave to her the moons of Mars.------------------------------------------------------------------------

mounting spirits as your valiancies, since there is no knowing to what
height Sir John Ramorny's pupils may arrive; and if these be such that
it is necessary to descend from them by a rope, you may find my mode of
management more convenient than the common practice.Marry, but you must
be provided with a high collared doublet, to conceal the ring of steel,
and, above all, such a bonus socius as Smother well to adjust the
noose.""Base poison vender," said Eviot, "men of our calling die on the field
of battle.""I will save the lesson, however," replied Buncle, "in case of some
pinching occasion.But what a night the bloody hangdog Bonthron must
have had of it, dancing a pavise in mid air to the music of his own
shackles, as the night wind swings him that way and this!""It were an alms deed to leave him there," said Eviot; "for his descent
from the gibbet will but encourage him to new murders.He knows but two
elements--drunkenness and bloodshed.""Perhaps Sir John Ramorny might have been of your opinion," said
Dwining; "but it would first have been necessary to cut out the rogue's
tongue, lest he had told strange tales from his airy height.And there
are other reasons that it concerns not your valiancies to know.In
truth, I myself have been generous in serving him, for the fellow is
built as strong as Edinburgh Castle, and his anatomy would have matched
any that is in the chirurgical hall of Padua.But tell me, Master
Buncle, what news bring you from the doughty Douglas?""They may tell that know," said Buncle."I am the dull ass that bears
the message, and kens nought of its purport.I carried letters from the Duke of Albany and from Sir John
Ramorny to the Douglas, and he looked black as a northern tempest when
he opened them.I brought them answers from the Earl, at which they
smiled like the sun when the harvest storm is closing over him.Go to
your ephemerides, leech, and conjure the meaning out of that.""Methinks I can do so without much cost of wit," said the chirurgeon;
"but yonder I see in the pale moonlight our dead alive.Should he have
screamed out to any chance passenger, it were a curious interruption
to a night journey to be hailed from the top of such a gallows as that.Hark, methinks I do hear his groans amid the whistling of the wind and
the creaking of the chains.So--fair and softly; make fast the boat
with the grappling, and get out the casket with my matters, we would be
better for a little fire, but the light might bring observation on
us.Come on, my men of valour, march warily, for we are bound for the
gallows foot.Follow with the lantern; I trust the ladder has been left."Sing, three merry men, and three merry men,
     And three merry men are we,
     Thou on the land, and I on the sand,
     And Jack on the gallows tree."As they advanced to the gibbet, they could plainly hear groans, though
uttered in a low tone.Dwining ventured to give a low cough once or
twice, by way of signal; but receiving no answer, "We had best make
haste," said he to his companions, "for our friend must be in extremis,
as he gives no answer to the signal which announces the arrival of help.I will go up the ladder first and cut the
rope.Do you two follow, one after another, and take fast hold of the
body, so that he fall not when the halter is unloosed.Keep sure gripe,
for which the bandages will afford you convenience.Bethink you that,
though he plays an owl's part tonight, he hath no wings, and to fall out
of a halter may be as dangerous as to fall into one."While he spoke thus with sneer and gibe, he ascended the ladder, and
having ascertained that the men at arms who followed him had the body in
their hold, he cut the rope, and then gave his aid to support the almost
lifeless form of the criminal.By a skilful exertion of strength and address, the body of Bonthron was
placed safely on the ground; and the faint yet certain existence of life
having been ascertained, it was thence transported to the river side,
where, shrouded by the bank, the party might be best concealed from
observation, while the leech employed himself in the necessary means of
recalling animation, with which he had taken care to provide himself.For this purpose he first freed the recovered person from his shackles,
which the executioner had left unlocked on purpose, and at the same time
disengaged the complicated envelopes and bandages by which he had been
suspended.It was some time ere Dwining's efforts succeeded; for, in
despite of the skill with which his machine had been constructed, the
straps designed to support the body had stretched so considerably as to
occasion the sense of suffocation becoming extremely overpowering.But
the address of the surgeon triumphed over all obstacles; and, after
sneezing and stretching himself, with one or two brief convulsions,
Bonthron gave decided proofs of reanimation, by arresting the hand
of the operator as it was in the act of dropping strong waters on his
breast and throat, and, directing the bottle which contained them to his
lips, he took, almost perforce, a considerable gulp of the contents."It is spiritual essence double distilled," said the astonished
operator, "and would blister the throat and burn the stomach of any
other man.But this extraordinary beast is so unlike all other human
creatures, that I should not wonder if it brought him to the complete
possession of his faculties."Bonthron seemed to confirm this: he started with a strong convulsion,
sat up, stared around, and indicated some consciousness of existence."Wine--wine," were the first words which he articulated.The leech gave him a draught of medicated wine, mixed with water.He
rejected it, under the dishonourable epithet of "kennel washings," and
again uttered the words, "Wine--wine.""Nay, take it to thee, i' the devil's name," said the leech, "since none
but he can judge of thy constitution."A draught, long and deep enough to have discomposed the intellects of
any other person, was found effectual in recalling those of Bonthron to
a more perfect state; though he betrayed no recollection of where he was
or what had befallen him, and in his brief and sullen manner asked why
he was brought to the river side at this time of night."Another frolic of the wild Prince, for drenching me as he did before.Nails and blood, but I would--"

"Hold thy peace," interrupted Eviot, "and be thankful, I pray you, if
you have any thankfulness in you, that thy body is not crow's meat and
thy soul in a place where water is too scarce to duck thee.""I begin to bethink me," said the ruffian; and raising the flask to his
mouth, which he saluted with a long and hearty kiss, he set the empty
bottle on the earth, dropped his head on his bosom, and seemed to muse
for the purpose of arranging his confused recollections."We can abide the issue of his meditations no longer," said Dwining; "he
will be better after he has slept.you have been riding the air
these some hours; try if the water be not an easier mode of conveyance.I can no more lift this mass than I
could raise in my arms a slaughtered bull.""Stand upright on thine own feet, Bonthron, now we have placed thee upon
them," said Eviot."Every drop of blood tingles in my
veins as if it had pinpoints, and my knees refuse to bear their burden.This is some practice of thine,
thou dog leech!""Ay--ay, so it is, honest Bonthron," said Dwining--"a practice thou
shalt thank me for when thou comest to learn it.In the mean while,
stretch down in the stern of that boat, and let me wrap this cloak about
thee."Assisted into the boat accordingly, Bonthron was deposited there as
conveniently as things admitted of.He answered their attentions with
one or two snorts resembling the grunt of a boar who has got some food
particularly agreeable to him."And now, Buncle," said the chirurgeon, "your valiant squireship
knows your charge.You are to carry this lively cargo by the river to
Newburgh, where you are to dispose of him as you wot of; meantime,
here are his shackles and bandages, the marks of his confinement and
liberation.Bind them up together, and fling them into the deepest pool
you pass over; for, found in your possession, they might tell tales
against us all.This low, light breath of wind from the west will permit
you to use a sail as soon as the light comes in and you are tired of
rowing.Your other valiancie, Master Page Eviot, must be content to
return to Perth with me afoot, for here severs our fair company.Take
with thee the lantern, Buncle, for thou wilt require it more than we,
and see thou send me back my flasket."As the pedestrians returned to Perth, Eviot expressed his belief that
Bonthron's understanding would never recover the shock which terror had
inflicted upon it, and which appeared to him to have disturbed all the
faculties of his mind, and in particular his memory."It is not so, an it please your pagehood," said the leech."Bonthron's
intellect, such as it is, hath a solid character: it Will but vacillate
to and fro like a pendulum which hath been put in motion, and then will
rest in its proper point of gravity.Our memory is, of all our powers of
mind, that which is peculiarly liable to be suspended.Deep intoxication
or sound sleep alike destroy it, and yet it returns when the drunkard
becomes sober or the sleeper is awakened.I knew at Paris a criminal condemned to die by the halter,
who suffered the sentence accordingly, showing no particular degree of
timidity upon the scaffold, and behaving and expressing himself as men
in the same condition are wont to do.Accident did for him what a little
ingenious practice hath done for our amiable friend from whom we but
now parted.He was cut down and given to his friends before life was
extinct, and I had the good fortune to restore him.But, though he
recovered in other particulars, he remembered but little of his trial
and sentence.Of his confession on the morning of his execution--he!(in his usual chuckling manner)--he remembered him not a word.Neither of leaving the prison, nor of his passage to the Greve, where
he suffered, nor of the devout speeches with which he--he!he!--so many good Christians, nor of ascending the
fatal tree, nor of taking the fatal leap, had my revenant the slightest
recollection.'But here we reach the point where we must separate;
for it were unfit, should we meet any of the watch, that we be found
together, and it were also prudent that we enter the city by different
gates.My profession forms an excuse for my going and coming at all
times.Your valiant pagehood will make such explanation as may seem
sufficing.""I shall make my will a sufficient excuse if I am interrogated," said
the haughty young man."Yet I will avoid interruption, if possible.The
moon is quite obscured, and the road as black as a wolf's mouth.""Tut," said the physicianer, "let not your valour care for that: we
shall tread darker paths ere it be long."Without inquiring into the meaning of these evil boding sentences, and
indeed hardly listening to them in the pride and recklessness of his
nature, the page of Ramorny parted from his ingenious and dangerous
companion, and each took his own way.The course of true love never did run smooth.The ominous anxiety of our armourer had not played him false.When the
good glover parted with his intended son in law, after the judicial
combat had been decided, he found what he indeed had expected, that his
fair daughter was in no favourable disposition towards her lover.But
although he perceived that Catharine was cold, restrained, collected,
had cast away the appearance of mortal passion, and listened with a
reserve, implying contempt, to the most splendid description he could
give her of the combat in the Skinners' Yards, he was determined not
to take the least notice of her altered manner, but to speak of her
marriage with his son Henry as a thing which must of course take place.At length, when she began, as on a former occasion, to intimate that her
attachment to the armourer did not exceed the bounds of friendship, that
she was resolved never to marry, that the pretended judicial combat
was a mockery of the divine will, and of human laws, the glover not
unnaturally grew angry."I cannot read thy thoughts, wench; nor can I pretend to guess under
what wicked delusion it is that you kiss a declared lover, suffer him
to kiss you, run to his house when a report is spread of his death, and
fling yourself into his arms when you find him alone [alive].All
this shows very well in a girl prepared to obey her parents in a match
sanctioned by her father; but such tokens of intimacy, bestowed on one
whom a young woman cannot esteem, and is determined not to marry, are
uncomely and unmaidenly.You have already been more bounteous of your
favours to Henry Smith than your mother, whom God assoilzie, ever was to
me before I married her.I tell thee, Catharine, this trifling with the
love of an honest man is what I neither can, will, nor ought to endure.I have given my consent to the match, and I insist it shall take place
without delay, and that you receive Henry Wynd tomorrow, as a man whose
bride you are to be with all despatch.""A power more potent than yours, father, will say no," replied
Catharine."I will risk it; my power is a lawful one, that of a father over a
child, and an erring child," answered her father."God and man allow of
my influence.""Then, may Heaven help us," said Catharine; "for, if you are obstinate
in your purpose, we are all lost.""We can expect no help from Heaven," said the glover, "when we act
with indiscretion.I am clerk enough myself to know that; and that your
causeless resistance to my will is sinful, every priest will inform
you.Ay, and more than that, you have spoken degradingly of the blessed
appeal to God in the combat of ordeal.for the Holy Church
is awakened to watch her sheepfold, and to extirpate heresy by fire and
steel; so much I warn thee of."Catharine uttered a suppressed exclamation; and, with difficulty
compelling herself to assume an appearance of composure, promised her
father that, if he would spare her any farther discussion of the subject
till tomorrow morning, she would then meet him, determined to make a
full discovery of her sentiments.With this promise Simon Glover was obliged to remain contented, though
extremely anxious for the postponed explanation.It could not be levity
or fickleness of character which induced his daughter to act with so
much apparent inconsistency towards the man of his choice, and whom she
had so lately unequivocally owned to be also the man of her own.What
external force there could exist, of a kind powerful enough to change
the resolutions she had so decidedly expressed within twenty-four hours,
was a matter of complete mystery."But I will be as obstinate as she can be," thought the glover, "and she
shall either marry Henry Smith without farther delay or old Simon Glover
will know an excellent reason to the contrary."The subject was not renewed during the evening; but early on the next
morning, just at sun rising, Catharine knelt before the bed in which her
parent still slumbered.Her heart sobbed as if it would burst, and her
tears fell thick upon her father's face.The good old man awoke, looked
up, crossed his child's forehead, and kissed her affectionately."I understand thee, Kate," he said; "thou art come to confession, and, I
trust, art desirous to escape a heavy penance by being sincere.""I need not ask, my father, if you remember the Carthusian monk,
Clement, and his preachings and lessons; at which indeed you assisted so
often, that you cannot be ignorant men called you one of his converts,
and with greater justice termed me so likewise?""I am aware of both," said the old man, raising himself on his elbow;
"but I defy foul fame to show that I ever owned him in any heretical
proposition, though I loved to hear him talk of the corruptions of the
church, the misgovernment of the nobles, and the wild ignorance of
the poor, proving, as it seemed to me, that the sole virtue of our
commonweal, its strength and its estimation, lay among the burgher
craft of the better class, which I received as comfortable doctrine, and
creditable to the town.And if he preached other than right doctrine,
wherefore did his superiors in the Carthusian convent permit it?If the
shepherds turn a wolf in sheep's clothing into the flock, they should
not blame the sheep for being worried.""They endured his preaching, nay, they encouraged it," said Catharine,
"while the vices of the laity, the contentions of the nobles, and
the oppression of the poor were the subject of his censure, and they
rejoiced in the crowds who, attracted to the Carthusian church,
forsook those of the other convents.But the hypocrites--for such they
are--joined with the other fraternities in accusing their preacher
Clement, when, passing from censuring the crimes of the state, he
began to display the pride, ignorance, and luxury of the churchmen
themselves--their thirst of power, their usurpation over men's
consciences, and their desire to augment their worldly wealth.""For God's sake, Catharine," said her father, "speak within doors: your
voice rises in tone and your speech in bitterness, your eyes sparkle.It is owing to this zeal in what concerns you no more than others
that malicious persons fix upon you the odious and dangerous name of a
heretic.""You know I speak no more than what is truth," said Catharine, "and
which you yourself have avouched often.""Wouldst
thou have me avouch what might cost me life and limb, land and goods?For a full commission hath been granted for taking and trying heretics,
upon whom is laid the cause of all late tumults and miscarriages;
wherefore, few words are best, wench.I am ever of mind with the old
maker:

"Since word is thrall and thought is free, Keep well thy tongue, I
counsel thee.""The counsel comes too late, father," answered Catharine, sinking down
on a chair by her father's bedside."The words have been spoken and
heard; and it is indited against Simon Glover, burgess in Perth, that he
hath spoken irreverent discourses of the doctrines of Holy Church.""As I live by knife and needle," interrupted Simon, "it is a lie!I
never was so silly as to speak of what I understood not.""And hath slandered the anointed of the church, both regular and
secular," continued Catharine."Nay, I will never deny the truth," said the glover: "an idle word I may
have spoken at the ale bench, or over a pottle pot of wine, or in right
sure company; but else, my tongue is not one to run my head into peril.""So you think, my dearest father; but your slightest language has been
espied, your best meaning phrases have been perverted, and you are in
dittay as a gross railer against church and churchmen, and for holding
discourse against them with loose and profligate persons, such as the
deceased Oliver Proudfute, the smith Henry of the Wynd, and others, set
forth as commending the doctrines of Father Clement, whom they charge
with seven rank heresies, and seek for with staff and spear, to try him
to the death.But that," said Catharine, kneeling, and looking upwards
with the aspect of one of those beauteous saints whom the Catholics have
given to the fine arts--"that they shall never do.He hath escaped from
the net of the fowler; and, I thank Heaven, it was by my means.""Thy means, girl--art thou mad?""I will not deny what I glory in," answered Catharine: "it was by my
means that Conachar was led to come hither with a party of men and carry
off the old man, who is now far beyond the Highland line.""Thou my rash--my unlucky child!"said the glover, "hast dared to aid
the escape of one accused of heresy, and to invite Highlanders in arms
to interfere with the administration of justice within burgh?thou hast offended both against the laws of the church and those of the
realm.What--what would become of us, were this known?""It is known, my dear father," said the maiden, firmly--"known even to
those who will be the most willing avengers of the deed.""This must be some idle notion, Catharine, or some trick of those
cogging priests and nuns; it accords not with thy late cheerful
willingness to wed Henry Smith."dearest father, remember the dismal surprise occasioned by his
reported death, and the joyful amazement at finding him alive; and deem
it not wonder if I permitted myself, under your protection, to say more
than my reflection justified.But then I knew not the worst, and thought
the danger exaggerated.Alas I was yesterday fearfully undeceived, when
the abbess herself came hither, and with her the Dominican.They showed
me the commission, under the broad seal of Scotland, for inquiring into
and punishing heresy; they showed me your name and my own in a list of
suspected persons; and it was with tears--real tears, that the abbess
conjured me to avert a dreadful fate by a speedy retreat into the
cloister, and that the monk pledged his word that you should not be
molested if I complied.""The foul fiend take them both for weeping crocodiles!"replied Catharine, "complaint or anger will little help us; but
you see I have had real cause for this present alarm."my reckless child, where was your
prudence when you ran headlong into such a snare?""Hear me, father," said Catharine; "there is still one mode of safety
held out: it is one which I have often proposed, and for which I have in
vain supplicated your permission.""I understand you--the convent," said her father."But, Catharine, what
abbess or prioress would dare--"

"That I will explain to you, father, and it will also show the
circumstances which have made me seem unsteady of resolution to a
degree which has brought censure upon me from yourself and others.Our
confessor, old Father Francis, whom I chose from the Dominican convent
at your command--"

"Ay, truly," interrupted the glover; "and I so counselled and commanded
thee, in order to take off the report that thy conscience was altogether
under the direction of Father Clement.""Well, this Father Francis has at different times urged and provoked me
to converse on such matters as he judged I was likely to learn something
of from the Carthusian preacher.I fell
into the snare, spoke freely, and, as he argued gently, as one who would
fain be convinced, I even spoke warmly in defence of what I believed
devoutly.The confessor assumed not his real aspect and betrayed not his
secret purpose until he had learned all that I had to tell him.It was
then that he threatened me with temporal punishment and with eternal
condemnation.Had his threats reached me alone, I could have stood firm;
for their cruelty on earth I could have endured, and their power beyond
this life I have no belief in."said the glover, who was well nigh beside himself
at perceiving at every new word the increasing extremity of his
daughter's danger, "beware of blaspheming the Holy Church, whose arms
are as prompt to strike as her ears are sharp to hear.""To me," said the Maid of Perth, again looking up, "the terrors of the
threatened denunciations would have been of little avail; but when they
spoke of involving thee, my father, in the charge against me, I own
I trembled, and desired to compromise.The Abbess Martha, of Elcho
nunnery, being my mother's kinswoman, I told her my distresses, and
obtained her promise that she would receive me, if, renouncing worldly
love and thoughts of wedlock, I would take the veil in her sisterhood.She had conversation on the topic, I doubt not, with the Dominican
Francis, and both joined in singing the same song."'Remain in the world,' said they, 'and thy father and thou shall be
brought to trial as heretics; assume the veil, and the errors of both
shall be forgiven and cancelled.'They spoke not even of recantation
of errors of doctrine: all should be peace if I would but enter the
convent.""I doubt not--I doubt not," said Simon: "the old glover is thought rich,
and his wealth would follow his daughter to the convent of Elcho, unless
what the Dominicans might claim as their own share.So this was thy call
to the veil, these thy objections to Henry Wynd?""Indeed, father, the course was urged on all hands, nor did my own
mind recoil from it.Sir John Ramorny threatened me with the powerful
vengeance of the young Prince, if I continued to repel his wicked suit;
and as for poor Henry, it is but of late that I have discovered, to
my own surprise--that--that I love his virtues more than I dislike his
faults.the discovery has only been made to render my quitting the
world more difficult than when I thought I had thee only to regret."She rested her head on her hand and wept bitterly."All this is folly," said the glover."Never was there an extremity so
pinching, but what a wise man might find counsel if he was daring enough
to act upon it.This has never been the land or the people over whom
priests could rule in the name of Rome, without their usurpation being
controlled.If they are to punish each honest burgher who says the
monks love gold, and that the lives of some of them cry shame upon the
doctrines they teach, why, truly, Stephen Smotherwell will not lack
employment; and if all foolish maidens are to be secluded from the world
because they follow the erring doctrines of a popular preaching friar,
they must enlarge the nunneries and receive their inmates on slighter
composition.Our privileges have been often defended against the Pope
himself by our good monarchs of yore, and when he pretended to interfere
with the temporal government of the kingdom, there wanted not a Scottish
Parliament who told him his duty in a letter that should have been
written in letters of gold.I have seen the epistle myself, and though
I could not read it, the very sight of the seals of the right reverend
prelates and noble and true barons which hung at it made my heart leap
for joy.Thou shouldst not have kept this secret, my child--but it is no
time to tax thee with thy fault.I will mount
instantly, and go to our Lord Provost and have his advice, and, as I
trust, his protection and that of other true hearted Scottish nobles,
who will not see a true man trodden down for an idle word."my father," said Catharine, "it was even this impetuosity which I
dreaded.I knew if I made my plaint to you there would soon be fire and
feud, as if religion, though sent to us by the Father of peace, were fit
only to be the mother of discord; and hence I could now--even now--give
up the world, and retire with my sorrow among the sisters of Elcho,
would you but let me be the sacrifice.Only, father--comfort poor Henry
when we are parted for ever; and do not--do not let him think of me too
harshly.Say Catharine will never vex him more by her remonstrances, but
that she will never forget him in her prayers.""The girl hath a tongue that would make a Saracen weep," said her
father, his own eyes sympathising with those of his daughter."But I
will not yield way to this combination between the nun and the priest to
rob me of my only child.Away with you, girl, and let me don my clothes;
and prepare yourself to obey me in what I may have to recommend for your
safety.Get a few clothes together, and what valuables thou hast; also,
take the keys of my iron box, which poor Henry Smith gave me, and divide
what gold you find into two portions; put the one into a purse for
thyself, and the other into the quilted girdle which I made on purpose
to wear on journeys.Thus both shall be provided, in case fate should
sunder us; in which event, God send the whirlwind may take the withered
leaf and spare the green one!Let them make ready my horse instantly,
and the white jennet that I bought for thee but a day since, hoping to
see thee ride to St.John's Kirk with maids and matrons, as blythe a
bride as ever crossed the holy threshold.Away, and remember that the saints help those who are willing to help
themselves.Not a word in answer; begone, I say--no wilfullness now.The
pilot in calm weather will let a sea boy trifle with the rudder; but, by
my soul, when winds howl and waves arise, he stands by the helm himself.Catharine left the room to execute, as well as she might, the commands
of her father, who, gentle in disposition and devotedly attached to his
child, suffered her often, as it seemed, to guide and rule both herself
and him; yet who, as she knew, was wont to claim filial obedience and
exercise parental authority with sufficient strictness when the occasion
seemed to require an enforcement of domestic discipline.While the fair Catharine was engaged in executing her father's behests,
and the good old glover was hastily attiring himself, as one who was
about to take a journey, a horse's tramp was heard in the narrow street.The horseman was wrapped in his riding cloak, having the cape of it
drawn up, as if to hide the under part of his face, while his bonnet was
pulled over his brows, and a broad plume obscured his upper features.He sprung from the saddle, and Dorothy had scarce time to reply to
his inquiries that the glover was in his bedroom, ere the stranger had
ascended the stair and entered the sleeping apartment.Simon, astonished
and alarmed, and disposed to see in this early visitant an apparitor or
sumner come to attach him and his daughter, was much relieved when, as
the stranger doffed the bonnet and threw the skirt of the mantle from
his face, he recognised the knightly provost of the Fair City, a visit
from whom at any time was a favour of no ordinary degree, but, being
made at such an hour, had something marvellous, and, connected with the
circumstances of the times, even alarming."This high honour done to your
poor beadsman--"

"Hush!"said the knight, "there is no time for idle civilities.I came
hither because a man is, in trying occasions, his own safest page, and
I can remain no longer than to bid thee fly, good glover, since warrants
are to be granted this day in council for the arrest of thy daughter and
thee, under charge of heresy; and delay will cost you both your liberty
for certain, and perhaps your lives.""I have heard something of such a matter," said the glover, "and was
this instant setting forth to Kinfauns to plead my innocence of this
scandalous charge, to ask your lordship's counsel, and to implore your
protection.""Thy innocence, friend Simon, will avail thee but little before
prejudiced judges; my advice is, in one word, to fly, and wait for
happier times.As for my protection, we must tarry till the tide turns
ere it will in any sort avail thee.But if thou canst lie concealed for
a few days or weeks, I have little doubt that the churchmen, who, by
siding with the Duke of Albany in court intrigue, and by alleging
the decay of the purity of Catholic doctrine as the sole cause of the
present national misfortunes, have, at least for the present hour, an
irresistible authority over the King, will receive a check.In the mean
while, however, know that King Robert hath not only given way to this
general warrant for inquisition after heresy, but hath confirmed the
Pope's nomination of Henry Wardlaw to be Archbishop of St.Andrews and
Primate of Scotland; thus yielding to Rome those freedoms and immunities
of the Scottish Church which his ancestors, from the time of Malcolm
Canmore, have so boldly defended.His brave fathers would have rather
subscribed a covenant with the devil than yielded in such a matter to
the pretensions of Rome.""None, old man, save in some sudden court change," said Sir Patrick."The King is but like a mirror, which, having no light itself, reflects
back with equal readiness any which is placed near to it for the
time.Now, although the Douglas is banded with Albany, yet the Earl is
unfavourable to the high claims of those domineering priests, having
quarrelled with them about the exactions which his retinue hath raised
on the Abbot of Arbroath.He will come back again with a high hand, for
report says the Earl of March hath fled before him.When he returns
we shall have a changed world, for his presence will control Albany;
especially as many nobles, and I myself, as I tell you in confidence,
are resolved to league with him to defend the general right.Thy exile,
therefore, will end with his return to our court.Thou hast but to seek
thee some temporary hiding place.""For that, my lord," said the glover, "I can be at no loss, since I
have just title to the protection of the high Highland chief, Gilchrist
MacIan, chief of the Clan Quhele.""Nay, if thou canst take hold of his mantle thou needs no help of any
one else: neither Lowland churchman nor layman finds a free course of
justice beyond the Highland frontier.""But then my child, noble sir--my Catharine?"The graddan cake will keep her white teeth
in order, the goat's whey will make the blood spring to her cheek again,
which these alarms have banished and even the Fair Maiden of Perth may
sleep soft enough on a bed of Highland breckan.""It is not from such idle respects, my lord, that I hesitate," said the
glover."Catharine is the daughter of a plain burgher, and knows not
nicety of food or lodging.But the son of MacIan hath been for many
years a guest in my house, and I am obliged to say that I have observed
him looking at my daughter, who is as good as a betrothed bride, in a
manner that, though I cared not for it in this lodging in Curfew Street,
would give me some fear of consequences in a Highland glen, where I have
no friend and Conachar many."The knightly provost replied by a long whistle.Nay, in
that case, I advise thee to send her to the nunnery at Elcho, where the
abbess, if I forget not, is some relation of yours.Indeed, she said so
herself, adding, that she loved her kinswoman well, together with all
that belongs to thee, Simon.""Truly, my lord, I do believe that the abbess hath so much regard for
me, that she would willingly receive the trust of my daughter, and
my whole goods and gear, into her sisterhood.Marry, her affection is
something of a tenacious character, and would be loth to unloose its
hold, either upon the wench or her tocher."again whistled the Knight of Kinfauns; "by the Thane's
Cross, man, but this is an ill favoured pirn to wind: Yet it shall never
be said the fairest maid in the Fair City was cooped up in a convent,
like a kain hen in a cavey, and she about to be married to the bold
burgess Henry Wynd.That tale shall not be told while I wear belt and
spurs, and am called Provost of Perth.""We must all take our share of the risk.Come, get you and your daughter
presently to horse.You shall ride with me, and we'll see who dare
gloom at you.The summons is not yet served on thee, and if they send
an apparitor to Kinfauns without a warrant under the King's own hand,
I make mine avow, by the Red Rover's soul!that he shall eat his
writ, both wax and wether skin.and," addressing
Catharine, as she entered at the moment, "you too, my pretty maid--

"To horse, and fear not for your quarters; They thrive in law that trust
in Charters."In a minute or two the father and daughter were on horseback, both
keeping an arrow's flight before the provost, by his direction, that
they might not seem to be of the same company.They passed the eastern
gate in some haste, and rode forward roundly until they were out of
sight.Sir Patrick followed leisurely; but, when he was lost to the view
of the warders, he spurred his mettled horse, and soon came up with the
glover and Catharine, when a conversation ensued which throws light upon
some previous passages of this history.seed of those who scorn'd
     To stoop the neck to wide imperial Rome--
     Oh, dearest half of Albion sea walled!"I have been devising a mode," said the well meaning provost, "by which
I may make you both secure for a week or two from the malice of your
enemies, when I have little doubt I may see a changed world at court.But that I may the better judge what is to be done, tell me frankly,
Simon, the nature of your connexion with Gilchrist MacIan, which leads
you to repose such implicit confidence in him.You are a close observer
of the rules of the city, and are aware of the severe penalties which
they denounce against such burghers as have covine and alliance with the
Highland clans.""True, my lord; but it is also known to you that our craft, working in
skins of cattle, stags, and every other description of hides, have a
privilege, and are allowed to transact with those Highlanders, as with
the men who can most readily supply us with the means of conducting our
trade, to the great profit of the burgh.Thus it hath chanced with me to
have great dealings with these men; and I can take it on my salvation,
that you nowhere find more just and honourable traffickers, or by whom a
man may more easily make an honest penny.I have made in my day several
distant journeys into the far Highlands, upon the faith of their chiefs;
nor did I ever meet with a people more true to their word, when you
can once prevail upon them to plight it in your behalf.And as for the
Highland chief, Gilchrist MacIan, saving that he is hasty in homicide
and fire raising towards those with whom he hath deadly feud, I have
nowhere seen a man who walketh a more just and upright path.""It is more than ever I heard before," said Sir Patrick Charteris."Yet
I have known something of the Highland runagates too.""They show another favour, and a very different one, to their friends
than to their enemies, as your lordship shall understand," said the
glover."However, be that as it may, it chanced me to serve Gilchrist
MacIan in a high matter.It is now about eighteen years since, that it
chanced, the Clan Quhele and Clan Chattan being at feud, as indeed they
are seldom at peace, the former sustained such a defeat as well nigh
extirpated the family of their chief MacIan.Seven of his sons were
slain in battle and after it, himself put to flight, and his castle
taken and given to the flames.His wife, then near the time of giving
birth to an infant, fled into the forest, attended by one faithful
servant and his daughter.Here, in sorrow and care enough, she gave
birth to a boy; and as the misery of the mother's condition rendered her
little able to suckle the infant, he was nursed with the milk of a doe,
which the forester who attended her contrived to take alive in a snare.It was not many months afterwards that, in a second encounter of these
fierce clans, MacIan defeated his enemies in his turn, and regained
possession of the district which he had lost.It was with unexpected
rapture that he found his wife and child were in existence, having never
expected to see more of them than the bleached bones, from which the
wolves and wildcats had eaten the flesh."But a strong and prevailing prejudice, such as is often entertained
by these wild people, prevented their chief from enjoying the full
happiness arising from having thus regained his only son in safety.An
ancient prophecy was current among them, that the power of the tribe
should fall by means of a boy born under a bush of holly and suckled
by a white doe.The circumstance, unfortunately for the chief, tallied
exactly with the birth of the only child which remained to him, and it
was demanded of him by the elders of the clan, that the boy should be
either put to death or at least removed from the dominions of the tribe
and brought up in obscurity.Gilchrist MacIan was obliged to consent and
having made choice of the latter proposal, the child, under the name of
Conachar, was brought up in my family, with the purpose, as was at first
intended, of concealing from him all knowledge who or what he was, or of
his pretensions to authority over a numerous and warlike people.But,
as years rolled on, the elders of the tribe, who had exerted so much
authority, were removed by death, or rendered incapable of interfering
in the public affairs by age; while, on the other hand, the influence of
Gilchrist MacIan was increased by his successful struggles against
the Clan Chattan, in which he restored the equality betwixt the two
contending confederacies, which had existed before the calamitous defeat
of which I told your honour.Feeling himself thus firmly seated, he
naturally became desirous to bring home his only son to his bosom and
family; and for that purpose caused me to send the young Conachar, as
he was called, more than once to the Highlands.He was a youth expressly
made, by his form and gallantry of bearing, to gain a father's heart.At length, I suppose the lad either guessed the secret of his birth
or something of it was communicated to him; and the disgust which the
paughty Hieland varlet had always shown for my honest trade became more
manifest; so that I dared not so much as lay my staff over his costard,
for fear of receiving a stab with a dirk, as an answer in Gaelic to
a Saxon remark.It was then that I wished to be well rid of him, the
rather that he showed so much devotion to Catharine, who, forsooth, set
herself up to wash the Ethiopian, and teach a wild Hielandmnan mercy and
morals."Nay, my father," said Catharine, "it was surely but a point of charity
to snatch the brand from the burning.""But a small point of wisdom," said her father, "to risk the burning of
your own fingers for such an end."My lord would not offend the Fair Maid of Perth," said Sir Patrick;
"and he knows well the purity and truth of her mind.And yet I must
needs say that, had this nursling of the doe been shrivelled, haggard,
cross made, and red haired, like some Highlanders I have known, I
question if the Fair Maiden of Perth would have bestowed so much zeal
upon his conversion; and if Catharine had been as aged, wrinkled, and
bent by years as the old woman that opened the door for me this morning,
I would wager my gold spurs against a pair of Highland brogues that this
wild roebuck would never have listened to a second lecture.You laugh,
glover, and Catharine blushes a blush of anger.Let it pass, it is the
way of the world.""The way in which the men of the world esteem their neighbours, my
lord," answered Catharine, with some spirit."Nay, fair saint, forgive a jest," said the knight; "and thou, Simon,
tell us how this tale ended--with Conachar's escape to the Highlands, I
suppose?""With his return thither," said the glover."There was, for some two
or three years, a fellow about Perth, a sort of messenger, who came
and went under divers pretences, but was, in fact, the means of
communication between Gilchrist MacIan and his son, young Conachar, or,
as he is now called, Hector.From this gillie I learned, in general,
that the banishment of the dault an neigh dheil, or foster child of
the white doe, was again brought under consideration of the tribe.His
foster father, Torquil of the Oak, the old forester, appeared with
eight sons, the finest men of the clan, and demanded that the doom of
banishment should be revoked.He spoke with the greater authority, as
he was himself taishatar, or a seer, and supposed to have communication
with the invisible world.He affirmed that he had performed a magical
ceremony, termed tine egan, by which he evoked a fiend, from whom he
extorted a confession that Conachar, now called Eachin, or Hector,
MacIan, was the only man in the approaching combat between the two
hostile clans who should come off without blood or blemish.Hence
Torquil of the Oak argued that the presence of the fated person was
necessary to ensure the victory.'So much I am possessed of this,' said
the forester, 'that, unless Eachin fight in his place in the ranks of
the Clan Quhele, neither I, his foster father, nor any of my eight sons
will lift a weapon in the quarrel.'"This speech was received with much alarm; for the defection of
nine men, the stoutest of their tribe, would be a serious blow, more
especially if the combat, as begins to be rumoured, should be decided by
a small number from each side.The ancient superstition concerning
the foster son of the white doe was counterbalanced by a new and later
prejudice, and the father took the opportunity of presenting to the
clan his long hidden son, whose youthful, but handsome and animated,
countenance, haughty carriage, and active limbs excited the admiration
of the clansmen, who joyfully received him as the heir and descendant of
their chief, notwithstanding the ominous presage attending his birth and
nurture."From this tale, my lord," continued Simon Glover, "your lordship may
easily conceive why I myself should be secure of a good reception among
the Clan Quhele; and you may also have reason to judge that it would be
very rash in me to carry Catharine thither.And this, noble lord, is the
heaviest of my troubles.""We shall lighten the load, then," said Sir Patrick; "and, good glover,
I will take risk for thee and this damsel.My alliance with the Douglas
gives me some interest with Marjory, Duchess of Rothsay, his daughter,
the neglected wife of our wilful Prince.Rely on it, good glover, that
in her retinue thy daughter will be as secure as in a fenced castle.The
Duchess keeps house now at Falkland, a castle which the Duke of Albany,
to whom it belongs, has lent to her for her accommodation.I cannot
promise you pleasure, Fair Maiden; for the Duchess Marjory of Rothsay
is unfortunate, and therefore splenetic, haughty, and overbearing;
conscious of the want of attractive qualities, therefore jealous of
those women who possess them.But she is firm in faith and noble in
spirit, and would fling Pope or prelate into the ditch of her castle who
should come to arrest any one under her protection.You will therefore
have absolute safety, though you may lack comfort.""I have no title to more," said Catharine; "and deeply do I feel the
kindness that is willing to secure me such honourable protection.If she
be haughty, I will remember she is a Douglas, and hath right, as being
such, to entertain as much pride as may become a mortal; if she be
fretful, I will recollect that she is unfortunate, and if she be
unreasonably captious, I will not forget that she is my protectress.Heed no longer for me, my lord, when you have placed me under the noble
lady's charge.But my poor father, to be exposed amongst these wild and
dangerous people!""Think not of that, Catharine," said the glover: "I am as familiar with
brogues and bracken as if I had worn them myself.I have only to fear
that the decisive battle may be fought before I can leave this country;
and if the clan Quhele lose the combat, I may suffer by the ruin of my
protectors.""We must have that cared for," said Sir Patrick: "rely on my looking out
for your safety.But which party will carry the day, think you?""Frankly, my Lord Provost, I believe the Clan Chattan will have the
worse: these nine children of the forest form a third nearly of the band
surrounding the chief of Clan Quhele, and are redoubted champions.""And your apprentice, will he stand to it, thinkest thou?""He is hot as fire, Sir Patrick," answered the glover; "but he is also
unstable as water.Nevertheless, if he is spared, he seems likely to be
one day a brave man.""But, as now, he has some of the white doe's milk still lurking about
his liver, ha, Simon?""He has little experience, my lord," said the glover, "and I need not
tell an honoured warrior like yourself that danger must be familiar to
us ere we can dally with it like a mistress."This conversation brought them speedily to the Castle of Kinfauns,
where, after a short refreshment, it was necessary that the father and
the daughter should part, in order to seek their respective places of
refuge.It was then first, as she saw that her father's anxiety on her
account had drowned all recollections of his friend, that Catharine
dropped, as if in a dream, the name of "Henry Gow.""True--most true," continued her father; "we must possess him of our
purposes.""Leave that to me," said Sir Patrick."I will not trust to a messenger,
nor will I send a letter, because, if I could write one, I think he
could not read it.He will suffer anxiety in the mean while, but I will
ride to Perth tomorrow by times and acquaint him with your designs."It was a bitter moment, but
the manly character of the old burgher, and the devout resignation of
Catharine to the will of Providence made it lighter than might have been
expected.The good knight hurried the departure of the burgess, but
in the kindest manner; and even went so far as to offer him some gold
pieces in loan, which might, where specie was so scarce, be considered
as the ne plus ultra of regard.The glover, however, assured him he
was amply provided, and departed on his journey in a northwesterly
direction.The hospitable protection of Sir Patrick Charteris was no
less manifested towards his fair guest.She was placed under the charge
of a duenna who managed the good knight's household, and was compelled
to remain several days in Kinfauns, owing to the obstacles and delays
interposed by a Tay boatman, named Kitt Henshaw, to whose charge she was
to be committed, and whom the provost highly trusted.Thus were severed the child and parent in a moment of great danger and
difficulty, much augmented by circumstances of which they were then
ignorant, and which seemed greatly to diminish any chance of safety that
remained for them."Austin may do the same again for me."Pope's Prologue to Canterbury Tales from Chaucer.The course of our story will be best pursued by attending that of Simon
Glover.It is not our purpose to indicate the exact local boundaries of
the two contending clans, especially since they are not clearly pointed
out by the historians who have transmitted accounts of this memorable
feud.It is sufficient to say, that the territory of the Clan Chattan
extended far and wide, comprehending Caithness and Sutherland, and
having for their paramount chief the powerful earl of the latter shire,
thence called Mohr ar Chat.In this general sense, the Keiths, the
Sinclairs, the Guns, and other families and clans of great power, were
included in the confederacy.These, however, were not engaged in the
present quarrel, which was limited to that part of the Clan Chattan
occupying the extensive mountainous districts of Perthshire and
Inverness shire, which form a large portion of what is called the
northeastern Highlands.It is well known that two large septs,
unquestionably known to belong to the Clan Chattan, the MacPhersons and
the MacIntoshes, dispute to this day which of their chieftains was at
the head of this Badenoch branch of the great confederacy, and both have
of later times assumed the title of Captain of Clan Chattan.But, at all events, Badenoch must have been the centre of the
confederacy, so far as involved in the feud of which we treat.Of the rival league of Clan Quhele we have a still less distinct
account, for reasons which will appear in the sequel.Some authors have
identified them with the numerous and powerful sept of MacKay.If this
is done on good authority, which is to be doubted, the MacKays must have
shifted their settlements greatly since the reign of Robert III, since
they are now to be found (as a clan) in the extreme northern parts of
Scotland, in the counties of Ross and Sutherland.We cannot, therefore,
be so clear as we would wish in the geography of the story.Suffice
it that, directing his course in a northwesterly direction, the glover
travelled for a day's journey in the direction of the Breadalbane
country, from which he hoped to reach the castle where Gilchrist MacIan,
the captain of the Clan Quhele, and the father of his pupil Conachar,
usually held his residence, with a barbarous pomp of attendance and
ceremonial suited to his lofty pretensions.We need not stop to describe the toil and terrors of such a journey,
where the path was to be traced among wastes and mountains, now
ascending precipitous ravines, now plunging into inextricable bogs,
and often intersected with large brooks, and even rivers.But all these
perils Simon Glover had before encountered in quest of honest gain; and
it was not to be supposed that he shunned or feared them where liberty,
and life itself, were at stake.The danger from the warlike and uncivilised inhabitants of these wilds
would have appeared to another at least as formidable as the perils of
the journey.But Simon's knowledge of the manners and language of the
people assured him on this point also.An appeal to the hospitality of
the wildest Gael was never unsuccessful; and the kerne, that in other
circumstances would have taken a man's life for the silver button of
his cloak, would deprive himself of a meal to relieve the traveller who
implored hospitality at the door of his bothy.The art of travelling in
the Highlands was to appear as confident and defenceless as possible;
and accordingly the glover carried no arms whatever, journeyed without
the least appearance of precaution, and took good care to exhibit
nothing which might excite cupidity.Another rule which he deemed it
prudent to observe was to avoid communication with any of the passengers
whom he might chance to meet, except in the interchange of the common
civilities of salutation, which the Highlanders rarely omit.Few
opportunities occurred of exchanging even such passing greetings.The
country, always lonely, seemed now entirely forsaken; and, even in the
little straths or valleys which he had occasion to pass or traverse,
the hamlets were deserted, and the inhabitants had betaken themselves to
woods and caves.This was easily accounted for, considering the imminent
dangers of a feud which all expected would become one of the most
general signals for plunder and ravage that had ever distracted that
unhappy country.Simon began to be alarmed at this state of desolation.He had made a
halt since he left Kinfauns, to allow his nag some rest; and now he
began to be anxious how he was to pass the night.He had reckoned
upon spending it at the cottage of an old acquaintance, called Niel
Booshalloch (or the cow herd), because he had charge of numerous herds
of cattle belonging to the captain of Clan Quhele, for which purpose he
had a settlement on the banks of the Tay, not far from the spot where
it leaves the lake of the same name.From this his old host and friend,
with whom he had transacted many bargains for hides and furs, the old
glover hoped to learn the present state of the country, the prospect of
peace or war, and the best measures to be taken for his own safety.It
will be remembered that the news of the indentures of battle entered
into for diminishing the extent of the feud had only been communicated
to King Robert the day before the glover left Perth, and did not become
public till some time afterwards."If Niel Booshalloch hath left his dwelling like the rest of them, I
shall be finely holped up," thought Simon, "since I want not only the
advantage of his good advice, but also his interest with Gilchrist
MacIan; and, moreover, a night's quarters and a supper."Thus reflecting, he reached the top of a swelling green hill, and saw
the splendid vision of Loch Tay lying beneath him--an immense plate of
polished silver, its dark heathy mountains and leafless thickets of oak
serving as an arabesque frame to a magnificent mirror.Indifferent to natural beauty at any time, Simon Glover was now
particularly so; and the only part of the splendid landscape on which he
turned his eye was an angle or loop of meadow land where the river Tay,
rushing in full swoln dignity from its parent lake, and wheeling around
a beautiful valley of about a mile in breadth, begins his broad course
to the southeastward, like a conqueror and a legislator, to subdue
and to enrich remote districts.Upon the sequestered spot, which is so
beautifully situated between lake, mountain, and river, arose afterwards
the feudal castle of the Ballough [Balloch is Gaelic for the discharge
of a lake into a river], which in our time has been succeeded by the
splendid palace of the Earls of Breadalbane.But the Campbells, though they had already attained very great power
in Argyleshire, had not yet extended themselves so far eastward as Loch
Tay, the banks of which were, either by right or by mere occupancy,
possessed for, the present by the Clan Quhele, whose choicest herds were
fattened on the Balloch margin of the lake.In this valley, therefore,
between the river and the lake, amid extensive forests of oak wood,
hazel, rowan tree, and larches, arose the humble cottage of Niel
Booshalloch, a village Eumaeus, whose hospitable chimneys were seen to
smoke plentifully, to the great encouragement of Simon Glover, who might
otherwise have been obliged to spend the night in the open air, to his
no small discomfort.He reached the door of the cottage, whistled, shouted, and made his
approach known.There was a baying of hounds and collies, and presently
the master of the hut came forth.There was much care on his brow, and
he seemed surprised at the sight of Simon Glover, though the herdsman
covered both as well as he might; for nothing in that region could be
reckoned more uncivil than for the landlord to suffer anything to escape
him in look or gesture which might induce the visitor to think that
his arrival was an unpleasing, or even an unexpected, incident.The
traveller's horse was conducted to a stable, which was almost too low
to receive him, and the glover himself was led into the mansion of the
Booshalloch, where, according to the custom of the country, bread
and cheese was placed before the wayfarer, while more solid food was
preparing.Simon, who understood all their habits, took no notice of the
obvious marks of sadness on the brow of his entertainer and on those of
the family, until he had eaten somewhat for form's sake, after which he
asked the general question, "Was there any news in the country?""Bad news as ever were told," said the herdsman: "our father is no
more."said Simon, greatly alarmed, "is the captain of the Clan Quhele
dead?""The captain of the Clan Quhele never dies," answered the Booshalloch;
"but Gilchrist MacIan died twenty hours since, and his son, Eachin
MacIan, is now captain.""What, Eachin--that is Conachar--my apprentice?""As little of that subject as you list, brother Simon," said the
herdsman."It is to be remembered, friend, that your craft, which doth
very well for a living in the douce city of Perth, is something too
mechanical to be much esteemed at the foot of Ben Lawers and on the
banks of Loch Tay.We have not a Gaelic word by which we can even name a
maker of gloves.""It would be strange if you had, friend Niel," said Simon, drily,
"having so few gloves to wear.I think there be none in the whole Clan
Quhele, save those which I myself gave to Gilchrist MacIan, whom God
assoilzie, who esteemed them a choice propine.Most deeply do I regret
his death, for I was coming to him on express business.""You had better turn the nag's head southward with morning light," said
the herdsman."The funeral is instantly to take place, and it must be
with short ceremony; for there is a battle to be fought by the Clan
Quhele and the Clan Chattan, thirty champions on a side, as soon as Palm
Sunday next, and we have brief time either to lament the dead or honour
the living.""Yet are my affairs so pressing, that I must needs see the young chief,
were it but for a quarter of an hour," said the glover."Hark thee, friend," replied his host, "I think thy business must be
either to gather money or to make traffic.Now, if the chief owe thee
anything for upbringing or otherwise, ask him not to pay it when all the
treasures of the tribe are called in for making gallant preparation of
arms and equipment for their combatants, that we may meet these proud
hill cats in a fashion to show ourselves their superiors.But if thou
comest to practise commerce with us, thy time is still worse chosen.Thou knowest that thou art already envied of many of our tribe, for
having had the fosterage of the young chief, which is a thing usually
given to the best of the clan."'exclaimed the glover, "men should remember the
office was not conferred on me as a favour which I courted, but that
it was accepted by me on importunity and entreaty, to my no small
prejudice.This Conachar, or Hector, of yours, or whatever you call him,
has destroyed me doe skins to the amount of many pounds Scots.""There again, now," said the Booshalloch, "you have spoken word to cost
your life--any allusion to skins or hides, or especially to deer and
does--may incur no less a forfeit.The chief is young, and jealous of
his rank; none knows the reason better than thou, friend Glover.He
will naturally wish that everything concerning the opposition to
his succession, and having reference to his exile, should be totally
forgotten; and he will not hold him in affection who shall recall the
recollection of his people, or force back his own, upon what they must
both remember with pain.Think how, at such a moment, they will look
on the old glover of Perth, to whom the chief was so long apprentice!Come--come, old friend, you have erred in this.You are in over great
haste to worship the rising sun, while his beams are yet level with the
horizon.Come thou when he has climbed higher in the heavens, and thou
shalt have thy share of the warmth of his noonday height.""Niel Booshalloch," said the glover, "we have been old friends, as thou
say'st; and as I think thee a true one, I will speak to thee freely,
though what I say might be perilous if spoken to others of thy clan.Thou think'st I come hither to make my own profit of thy young chief,
and it is natural thou shouldst think so.But I would not, at my years,
quit my own chimney corner in Curfew Street to bask me in the beams of
the brightest sun that ever shone upon Highland heather.The very truth
is, I come hither in extremity: my foes have the advantage of me, and
have laid things to my charge whereof I am incapable, even in thought.Nevertheless, doom is like to go forth against me, and there is no
remedy but that I must up and fly, or remain and perish.I come to your
young chief, as one who had refuge with me in his distress--who ate of
my bread and drank of my cup.I ask of him refuge, which, as I trust, I
shall need but a short time.""That makes a different case," replied the herdsman."So different,
that, if you came at midnight to the gate of MacIan, having the King
of Scotland's head in your hand, and a thousand men in pursuit for the
avenging of his blood, I could not think it for his honour to refuse you
protection.And for your innocence or guilt, it concerns not the case;
or rather, he ought the more to shelter you if guilty, seeing your
necessity and his risk are both in that case the greater.I must
straightway to him, that no hasty tongue tell him of your arriving
hither without saying the cause.""A pity of your trouble," said the glover; "but where lies the chief?""He is quartered about ten miles hence, busied with the affairs of the
funeral, and with preparations for the combat--the dead to the grave and
the living to battle.""It is a long way, and will take you all night to go and come," said the
glover; "and I am very sure that Conachar when he knows it is I who--"

"Forget Conachar," said the herdsman, placing his finger on his lips."And as for the ten miles, they are but a Highland leap, when one bears
a message between his friend and his chief."So saying, and committing the traveller to the charge of his eldest son
and his daughter, the active herdsman left his house two hours before
midnight, to which he returned long before sunrise.He did not disturb
his wearied guest, but when the old man had arisen in the morning he
acquainted him that the funeral of the late chieftain was to take place
the same day, and that, although Eachin MacIan could not invite a Saxon
to the funeral, he would be glad to receive him at the entertainment
which was to follow."His will must be obeyed," said the glover, half smiling at the change
of relation between himself and his late apprentice."The man is
the master now, and I trust he will remember that, when matters were
otherwise between us, I did not use my authority ungraciously."exclaimed the Booshalloch, "the less of that you say
the better.You will find yourself a right welcome guest to Eachin, and
the deil a man dares stir you within his bounds.But fare you well, for
I must go, as beseems me, to the burial of the best chief the clan ever
had, and the wisest captain that ever cocked the sweet gale (bog myrtle)
in his bonnet.Farewell to you for a while, and if you will go to the
top of the Tom an Lonach behind the house, you will see a gallant sight,
and hear such a coronach as will reach the top of Ben Lawers.A boat
will wait for you, three hours hence, at a wee bit creek about half a
mile westward from the head of the Tay."With these words he took his departure, followed by his three sons, to
man the boat in which he was to join the rest of the mourners, and two
daughters, whose voices were wanted to join in the lament, which was
chanted, or rather screamed, on such occasions of general affliction.Simon Glover, finding himself alone, resorted to the stable to look
after his nag, which, he found, had been well served with graddan, or
bread made of scorched barley.Of this kindness he was fully sensible,
knowing that, probably, the family had little of this delicacy left to
themselves until the next harvest should bring them a scanty supply.In
animal food they were well provided, and the lake found them abundance
of fish for their lenten diet, which they did not observe very strictly;
but bread was a delicacy very scanty in the Highlands.The bogs afforded
a soft species of hay, none of the best to be sure; but Scottish horses,
like their riders, were then accustomed to hard fare.Gauntlet, for this was the name of the palfrey, had his stall crammed
full of dried fern for litter, and was otherwise as well provided for as
Highland hospitality could contrive.Simon Glover being thus left to his own painful reflections, nothing
better remained, after having seen after the comforts of the dumb
companion of his journey, than to follow the herdsman's advice; and
ascending towards the top of an eminence called Tom an Lonach, or the
Knoll of Yew Trees, after a walk of half an hour he reached the summit,
and could look down on the broad expanse of the lake, of which the
height commanded a noble view.A few aged and scattered yew trees
of great size still vindicated for the beautiful green hill the name
attached to it.But a far greater number had fallen a sacrifice to
the general demand for bow staves in that warlike age, the bow being a
weapon much used by the mountaineers, though those which they employed,
as well as their arrows, were, in shape and form, and especially in
efficacy, far inferior to the archery of merry England.The dark and
shattered individual yews which remained were like the veterans of a
broken host, occupying in disorder some post of advantage, with the
stern purpose of resisting to the last.Behind this eminence, but
detached from it, arose a higher hill, partly covered with copsewood,
partly opening into glades of pasture, where the cattle strayed,
finding, at this season of the year, a scanty sustenance among the
spring heads and marshy places, where the fresh grass began first to
arise.The opposite or northern shore of the lake presented a far more Alpine
prospect than that upon which the glover was stationed.Woods and
thickets ran up the sides of the mountains, and disappeared among the
sinuosities formed by the winding ravines which separated them from each
other; but far above these specimens of a tolerable natural soil arose
the swart and bare mountains themselves, in the dark grey desolation
proper to the season.Some were peaked, some broad crested, some rocky and precipitous, others
of a tamer outline; and the clan of Titans seemed to be commanded by
their appropriate chieftains--the frowning mountain of Ben Lawers, and
the still more lofty eminence of Ben Mohr, arising high above the rest,
whose peaks retain a dazzling helmet of snow far into the summer season,
and sometimes during the whole year.Yet the borders of this wild and
silvan region, where the mountains descended upon the lake, intimated,
even at that early period, many traces of human habitation.Hamlets were
seen, especially on the northern margin of the lake, half hid among the
little glens that poured their tributary streams into Loch Tay, which,
like many earthly things, made a fair show at a distance, but, when more
closely approached, were disgustful and repulsive, from their squalid
want of the conveniences which attend even Indian wigwams.They were
inhabited by a race who neither cultivated the earth nor cared for
the enjoyments which industry procures.The women, although otherwise
treated with affection, and even delicacy of respect, discharged all the
absolutely necessary domestic labour.The men, excepting some reluctant
use of an ill formed plough, or more frequently a spade, grudgingly gone
through, as a task infinitely beneath them, took no other employment
than the charge of the herds of black cattle, in which their wealth
consisted.At all other times they hunted, fished, or marauded, during
the brief intervals of peace, by way of pastime; plundering with bolder
license, and fighting with embittered animosity, in time of war, which,
public or private, upon a broader or more restricted scale, formed the
proper business of their lives, and the only one which they esteemed
worthy of them.The magnificent bosom of the lake itself was a scene to gaze on with
delight.Its noble breadth, with its termination in a full and beautiful
run, was rendered yet more picturesque by one of those islets which are
often happily situated in the Scottish lakes.The ruins upon that isle,
now almost shapeless, being overgrown with wood rose, at the time we
speak of, into the towers and pinnacles of a priory, where slumbered
the remains of Sibylla, daughter of Henry I of England, and consort
of Alexander the First of Scotland.This holy place had been deemed of
dignity sufficient to be the deposit of the remains of the captain of
the Clan Quhele, at least till times when the removal of the danger, now
so imminently pressing, should permit of his body being conveyed to a
distinguished convent in the north, where he was destined ultimately to
repose with all his ancestry.A number of boats pushed off from various points of the near and more
distant shore, many displaying sable banners, and others having their
several pipers in the bow, who from time to time poured forth a few
notes of a shrill, plaintive, and wailing character, and intimated to
the glover that the ceremony was about to take place.These sounds of
lamentation were but the tuning as it were of the instruments, compared
with the general wail which was speedily to be raised.A distant sound was heard from far up the lake, even as it seemed from
the remote and distant glens out of which the Dochart and the Lochy pour
their streams into Loch Tay.It was in a wild, inaccessible spot, where
the Campbells at a subsequent period founded their strong fortress of
Finlayrigg, that the redoubted commander of the Clan Quhele drew his
last breath; and, to give due pomp to his funeral, his corpse was now to
be brought down the loch to the island assigned for his temporary place
of rest.The funeral fleet, led by the chieftain's barge, from which a
huge black banner was displayed, had made more than two thirds of its
voyage ere it was visible from the eminence on which Simon Glover stood
to overlook the ceremony.The instant the distant wail of the coronach
was heard proceeding from the attendants on the funeral barge, all the
subordinate sounds of lamentation were hushed at once, as the raven
ceases to croak and the hawk to whistle whenever the scream of the eagle
is heard.The boats, which had floated hither and thither upon the lake,
like a flock of waterfowl dispersing themselves on its surface, now drew
together with an appearance of order, that the funeral flotilla might
pass onward, and that they themselves might fall into their proper
places.In the mean while the piercing din of the war pipes became
louder and louder, and the cry from the numberless boats which followed
that from which the black banner of the chief was displayed rose in
wild unison up to the Tom an Lonach, from which the glover viewed the
spectacle.The galley which headed the procession bore on its poop a
species of scaffold, upon which, arrayed in white linen, and with the
face bare, was displayed the corpse of the deceased chieftain.His son
and the nearest relatives filled the vessel, while a great number of
boats, of every description that could be assembled, either on Loch
Tay itself or brought by land carriage from Loch Earn and otherwise,
followed in the rear, some of them of very frail materials.There were
even curraghs, composed of ox hides stretched over hoops of willow,
in the manner of the ancient British, and some committed themselves
to rafts formed for the occasion, from the readiest materials that
occurred, and united in such a precarious manner as to render it
probable that, before the accomplishment of the voyage, some of the
clansmen of the deceased might be sent to attend their chieftain in the
world of spirits.When the principal flotilla came in sight of the smaller group of boats
collected towards the foot of the lake, and bearing off from the little
island, they hailed each other with a shout so loud and general, and
terminating in a cadence so wildly prolonged, that not only the deer
started from their glens for miles around, and sought the distant
recesses of the mountains, but even the domestic cattle, accustomed to
the voice of man, felt the full panic which the human shout strikes into
the wilder tribes, and like them fled from their pasture into morasses
and dingles.Summoned forth from their convent by those sounds, the monks who
inhabited the little islet began to issue from their lowly portal, with
cross and banner, and as much of ecclesiastical state as they had the
means of displaying; their bells at the same time, of which the edifice
possessed three, pealing the death toll over the long lake, which came
to the ears of the now silent multitude, mingled with the solemn chant
of the Catholic Church, raised by the monks in their procession.Various
ceremonies were gone through, while the kindred of the deceased carried
the body ashore, and, placing it on a bank long consecrated to the
purpose, made the deasil around the departed.When the corpse was
uplifted to be borne into the church, another united yell burst from the
assembled multitude, in which the deep shout of warriors and the shrill
wail of females joined their notes with the tremulous voice of age and
the babbling cry of childhood.The coronach was again, and for the last
time, shrieked as the body was carried into the interior of the
church, where only the nearest relatives of the deceased and the most
distinguished of the leaders of the clan were permitted to enter.The
last yell of woe was so terribly loud, and answered by so many hundred
echoes, that the glover instinctively raised his hands to his ears, to
shut out, or deaden at least, a sound so piercing.He kept this attitude
while the hawks, owls, and other birds, scared by the wild scream, had
begun to settle in their retreats, when, as he withdrew his hands, a
voice close by him said:

"Think you this, Simon Glover, the hymn of penitence and praise with
which it becomes poor forlorn man, cast out from his tenement of clay,
to be wafted into the presence of his maker?"The glover turned, and in the old man with a long white beard who stood
close beside him had no difficulty, from the clear mild eye and the
benevolent cast of features, to recognise the Carthusian monk Father
Clement, no longer wearing his monastic habiliments, but wrapped in a
frieze mantle and having a Highland cap on his head.It may be recollected that the glover regarded this man with a combined
feeling of respect and dislike--respect, which his judgment could not
deny to the monk's person and character, and dislike, which arose from
Father Clement's peculiar doctrines being the cause of his daughter's
exile and his own distress.It was not, therefore, with sentiments of
unmixed satisfaction that he returned the greetings of the father, and
replied to the reiterated question, what he thought of the funeral rites
which were discharged in so wild a manner: "I know not, my good father;
but these men do their duty to their deceased chief according to the
fashion of their ancestors: they mean to express their regret for their
friend's loss and their prayers to Heaven in his behalf; and that which
is done of goodwill must, to my thinking, be accepted favourably.Had
it been otherwise, methinks they had ere now been enlightened to do
better.""Thou art deceived," answered the monk."God has sent His light amongst
us all, though in various proportions; but man wilfully shuts his eyes
and prefers darkness.This benighted people mingle with the ritual of
the Roman Church the old heathen ceremonies of their own fathers, and
thus unite with the abominations of a church corrupted by wealth and
power the cruel and bloody ritual of savage paynims.""Father," said Simon, abruptly, "methinks your presence were more
useful in yonder chapel, aiding your brethren in the discharge of their
clerical duties, than in troubling and unsettling the belief of an
humble though ignorant Christian like myself.""And wherefore say, good brother, that I would unfix thy principles of
belief?""So Heaven deal with me, as, were my life
blood necessary to cement the mind of any man to the holy religion he
professeth, it should be freely poured out for the purpose.""Your speech is fair, father, I grant you," said the glover; "but if I
am to judge the doctrine by the fruits, Heaven has punished me by the
hand of the church for having hearkened thereto.Ere I heard you, my
confessor was little moved though I might have owned to have told
a merry tale upon the ale bench, even if a friar or a nun were the
subject.If at a time I had called Father Hubert a better hunter of
hares than of souls, I confessed me to the Vicar Vinesauf, who laughed
and made me pay a reckoning for penance; or if I had said that the Vicar
Vinesauf was more constant to his cup than to his breviary, I confessed
me to Father Hubert, and a new hawking glove made all well again; and
thus I, my conscience, and Mother Church lived together on terms of
peace, friendship, and mutual forbearance.But since I have listened to
you, Father Clement, this goodly union is broke to pieces, and nothing
is thundered in my ear but purgatory in the next world and fire and
fagot in this.Therefore, avoid you, Father Clement, or speak to those
who can understand your doctrine.I have no heart to be a martyr: I have
never in my whole life had courage enough so much as to snuff a candle
with my fingers; and, to speak the truth, I am minded to go back to
Perth, sue out my pardon in the spiritual court, carry my fagot to the
gallows foot in token of recantation, and purchase myself once more the
name of a good Catholic, were it at the price of all the worldly wealth
that remains to me.""You are angry, my dearest brother," said Clement, "and repent you on
the pinch of a little worldly danger and a little worldly loss for the
good thoughts which you once entertained.""You speak at ease, Father Clement, since I think you have long forsworn
the wealth and goods of the world, and are prepared to yield up your
life when it is demanded in exchange for the doctrine you preach and
believe.You are as ready to put on your pitched shirt and brimstone
head gear as a naked man is to go to his bed, and it would seem you have
not much more reluctance to the ceremony.But I still wear that which
clings to me.My wealth is still my own, and I thank Heaven it is a
decent pittance whereon to live; my life, too, is that of a hale old man
of sixty, who is in no haste to bring it to a close; and if I were
poor as Job and on the edge of the grave, must I not still cling to my
daughter, whom your doctrines have already cost so dear?""Thy daughter, friend Simon," said the Carmelite [Carthusian], "may be
truly called an angel upon earth.""Ay, and by listening to your doctrines, father, she is now like to be
called on to be an angel in heaven, and to be transported thither in a
chariot of fire.""Nay, my good brother," said Clement, "desist, I pray you, to speak of
what you little understand.Since it is wasting time to show thee the
light that thou chafest against, yet listen to that which I have to say
touching thy daughter, whose temporal felicity, though I weigh it not
even for an instant in the scale against that which is spiritual, is,
nevertheless, in its order, as dear to Clement Blair as to her own
father."The tears stood in the old man's eyes as he spoke, and Simon Glover was
in some degree mollified as he again addressed him."One would think thee, Father Clement, the kindest and most amiable of
men; how comes it, then, that thy steps are haunted by general ill
will wherever thou chancest to turn them?I could lay my life thou hast
contrived already to offend yonder half score of poor friars in their
water girdled cage, and that you have been prohibited from attendance on
the funeral?""Even so, my son," said the Carthusian, "and I doubt whether their
malice will suffer me to remain in this country.I did but speak a few
sentences about the superstition and folly of frequenting St.Fillan's
church, to detect theft by means of his bell, of bathing mad patients in
his pool, to cure their infirmity of mind; and lo!the persecutors have
cast me forth of their communion, as they will speedily cast me out of
this life.""Lo you there now," said the glover, "see what it is for a man that
cannot take a warning!Well, Father Clement, men will not cast me forth
unless it were as a companion of yours.I pray you, therefore, tell me
what you have to say of my daughter, and let us be less neighbours than
we have been.""This, then, brother Simon, I have to acquaint you with.This young
chief, who is swoln with contemplation of his own power and glory, loves
one thing better than it all, and that is thy daughter.""My runagate apprentice look up to my
daughter!"said Clement, "how close sits our worldly pride, even as ivy
clings to the wall, and cannot be separated!Look up to thy daughter,
good Simon?The captain of Clan Quhele, great as he is, and
greater as he soon expects to be, looks down to the daughter of the
Perth burgess, and considers himself demeaned in doing so.But, to use
his own profane expression, Catharine is dearer to him than life here
and Heaven hereafter: he cannot live without her.""Then he may die, if he lists," said Simon Glover, "for she is betrothed
to an honest burgess of Perth; and I would not break my word to make my
daughter bride to the Prince of Scotland.""I thought it would be your answer," replied the monk; "I would, worthy
friend, thou couldst carry into thy spiritual concerns some part of that
daring and resolved spirit with which thou canst direct thy temporal
affairs.""Hush thee--hush, Father Clement!"answered the glover; "when thou
fallest into that vein of argument, thy words savour of blazing tar, and
that is a scent I like not.As to Catharine, I must manage as I can, so
as not to displease the young dignitary; but well is it for me that she
is far beyond his reach.""She must then be distant indeed," said the Carmelite [Carthusian]."And now, brother Simon, since you think it perilous to own me and my
opinions, I must walk alone with my own doctrines and the dangers they
draw on me.But should your eye, less blinded than it now is by worldly
hopes and fears, ever turn a glance back on him who soon may be snatched
from you, remember, that by nought save a deep sense of the truth and
importance of the doctrine which he taught could Clement Blair have
learned to encounter, nay, to provoke, the animosity of the powerful and
inveterate, to alarm the fears of the jealous and timid, to walk in the
world as he belonged not to it, and to be accounted mad of men, that he
might, if possible, win souls to God.Heaven be my witness, that I would
comply in all lawful things to conciliate the love and sympathy of my
fellow creatures!It is no light thing to be shunned by the worthy as
an infected patient, to be persecuted by the Pharisees of the day as an
unbelieving heretic, to be regarded with horror at once and contempt by
the multitude, who consider me as a madman, who may be expected to turn
mischievous.But were all those evils multiplied an hundredfold, the
fire within must not be stifled, the voice which says within me 'Speak'
must receive obedience.Woe unto me if I preach not the Gospel, even
should I at length preach it from amidst the pile of flames!"So spoke this bold witness, one of those whom Heaven raised up from time
to time to preserve amidst the most ignorant ages, and to carry down to
those which succeed them, a manifestation of unadulterated Christianity,
from the time of the Apostles to the age when, favoured by the invention
of printing, the Reformation broke out in full splendour.The selfish
policy of the glover was exposed in his own eyes; and he felt himself
contemptible as he saw the Carthusian turn from him in all the
hallowedness of resignation.He was even conscious of a momentary
inclination to follow the example of the preacher's philanthropy and
disinterested zeal, but it glanced like a flash of lightning through a
dark vault, where there lies nothing to catch the blaze; and he slowly
descended the hill in a direction different from that of the Carthusian,
forgetting him and his doctrines, and buried in anxious thoughts about
his child's fate and his own.What want these outlaws conquerors should have
     But history's purchased page to call them great,
     A wider space, an ornamented grave?Their hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.The funeral obsequies being over, the same flotilla which had proceeded
in solemn and sad array down the lake prepared to return with displayed
banners, and every demonstration of mirth and joy; for there was but
brief time to celebrate festivals when the awful conflict betwixt the
Clan Quhele and their most formidable rivals so nearly approached.It
had been agreed, therefore, that the funeral feast should be blended
with that usually given at the inauguration of the young chief.Some objections were made to this arrangement, as containing an evil
omen.But, on the other hand, it had a species of recommendation, from
the habits and feelings of the Highlanders, who, to this day, are wont
to mingle a degree of solemn mirth with their mourning, and something
resembling melancholy with their mirth.The usual aversion to speak
or think of those who have been beloved and lost is less known to this
grave and enthusiastic race than it is to others.You hear not only the
young mention (as is everywhere usual) the merits and the character of
parents, who have, in the course of nature, predeceased them; but the
widowed partner speaks, in ordinary conversation, of the lost spouse,
and, what is still stranger, the parents allude frequently to the beauty
or valour of the child whom they have interred.The Scottish Highlanders
appear to regard the separation of friends by death as something less
absolute and complete than it is generally esteemed in other countries,
and converse of the dear connexions who have sought the grave before
them as if they had gone upon a long journey in which they themselves
must soon follow.The funeral feast, therefore, being a general custom
throughout Scotland, was not, in the opinion of those who were to share
it, unseemingly mingled, on the present occasion, with the festivities
which hailed the succession to the chieftainship.The barge which had lately borne the dead to the grave now conveyed
the young MacIan to his new command and the minstrels sent forth their
gayest notes to gratulate Eachin's succession, as they had lately
sounded their most doleful dirges when carrying Gilchrist to his grave.From the attendant flotilla rang notes of triumph and jubilee, instead
of those yells of lamentation which had so lately disturbed the echoes
of Loch Tay; and a thousand voices hailed the youthful chieftain as he
stood on the poop, armed at all points, in the flower of early manhood,
beauty, and activity, on the very spot where his father's corpse had so
lately been extended, and surrounded by triumphant friends, as that had
been by desolate mourners.One boat kept closest of the flotilla to the honoured galley.Torquil
of the Oak, a grizzled giant, was steersman; and his eight sons, each
exceeding the ordinary stature of mankind, pulled the oars.Like some
powerful and favourite wolf hound, unloosed from his couples, and
frolicking around a liberal master, the boat of the foster brethren
passed the chieftain's barge, now on one side and now on another, and
even rowed around it, as if in extravagance of joy; while, at the same
time, with the jealous vigilance of the animal we have compared it to,
they made it dangerous for any other of the flotilla to approach so near
as themselves, from the risk of being run down by their impetuous
and reckless manoeuvres.Raised to an eminent rank in the clan by the
succession of their foster brother to the command of the Clan Quhele,
this was the tumultuous and almost terrible mode in which they testified
their peculiar share in their chief's triumph.Far behind, and with different feelings, on the part of one at least of
the company, came the small boat in which, manned by the Booshalloch and
one of his sons, Simon Glover was a passenger."If we are bound for the head of the lake," said Simon to his friend,
"we shall hardly be there for hours."But as he spoke the crew of the boat of the foster brethren, or
leichtach, on a signal from the chief's galley, lay on their oars until
the Booshalloch's boat came up, and throwing on board a rope of hides,
which Niel made fast to the head of his skiff, they stretched to their
oars once more, and, notwithstanding they had the small boat in tow,
swept through the lake with almost the same rapidity as before.The
skiff was tugged on with a velocity which seemed to hazard the pulling
her under water, or the separation of her head from her other timbers.Simon Glover saw with anxiety the reckless fury of their course, and the
bows of the boat occasionally brought within an inch or two of the level
of the water; and though his friend, Niel Booshalloch, assured him it
was all done in especial honour, he heartily wished his voyage might
have a safe termination.It had so, and much sooner than he apprehended;
for the place of festivity was not four miles distant from the
sepulchral island, being chosen to suit the chieftain's course, which
lay to the southeast, so soon as the banquet should be concluded.A
bay on the southern side of Loch Tay presented a beautiful beach of
sparkling sand, on which the boats might land with ease, and a dry
meadow, covered with turf, verdant considering the season, behind and
around which rose high banks, fringed with copsewood, and displaying the
lavish preparations which had been made for the entertainment.The Highlanders, well known for ready hatchet men, had constructed a
long arbour or silvan banqueting room, capable of receiving two hundred
men, while a number of smaller huts around seemed intended for sleeping
apartments.The uprights, the couples, and roof tree of the temporary
hall were composed of mountain pine, still covered with its bark.The
framework of the sides was of planks or spars of the same material,
closely interwoven with the leafy boughs of the fir and other
evergreens, which the neighbouring woods afforded, while the hills had
furnished plenty of heath to form the roof.Within this silvan palace
the most important personages present were invited to hold high
festival.Others of less note were to feast in various long sheds
constructed with less care; and tables of sod, or rough planks, placed
in the open air, were allotted to the numberless multitude.At a
distance were to be seen piles of glowing charcoal or blazing wood,
around which countless cooks toiled, bustled, and fretted, like so many
demons working in their native element.Pits, wrought in the hillside,
and lined with heated stones, served as ovens for stewing immense
quantities of beef, mutton, and venison; wooden spits supported sheep
and goats, which were roasted entire; others were cut into joints,
and seethed in caldrons made of the animal's own skins, sewed hastily
together and filled with water; while huge quantities of pike, trout,
salmon, and char were broiled with more ceremony on glowing embers.The
glover had seen many a Highland banquet, but never one the preparations
for which were on such a scale of barbarous profusion.He had little time, however, to admire the scene around him for, as
soon as they landed on the beach, the Booshalloch observed with some
embarrassment, that, as they had not been bidden to the table of the
dais, to which he seemed to have expected an invitation, they had best
secure a place in one of the inferior bothies or booths; and was leading
the way in that direction, when he was stopped by one of the bodyguards,
seeming to act as master of ceremonies, who whispered something in his
ear."I thought so," said the herdsman, much relieved--"I thought neither the
stranger nor the man that has my charge would be left out at the high
table."They were conducted accordingly into the ample lodge, within which were
long ranges of tables already mostly occupied by the guests, while those
who acted as domestics were placing upon them the abundant though rude
materials of the festival.The young chief, although he certainly saw
the glover and the herdsman enter, did not address any personal salute
to either, and their places were assigned them in a distant corner, far
beneath the salt, a huge piece of antique silver plate, the only article
of value that the table displayed, and which was regarded by the clan
as a species of palladium, only produced and used on the most solemn
occasions, such as the present.The Booshalloch, somewhat discontented, muttered to Simon as he took his
place: "These are changed days, friend.His father, rest his soul, would
have spoken to us both; but these are bad manners which he has learned
among you Sassenachs in the Low Country."To this remark the glover did not think it necessary to reply; instead
of which he adverted to the evergreens, and particularly to the skins
and other ornaments with which the interior of the bower was decorated.The most remarkable part of these ornaments was a number of Highland
shirts of mail, with steel bonnets, battle axes, and two handed swords
to match, which hung around the upper part of the room, together with
targets highly and richly embossed.Each mail shirt was hung over a well
dressed stag's hide, which at once displayed the armour to advantage and
saved it from suffering by damp."These," whispered the Booshalloch, "are the arms of the chosen
champions of the Clan Quhele.They are twenty-nine in number, as you
see, Eachin himself being the thirtieth, who wears his armour today,
else had there been thirty.And he has not got such a good hauberk after
all as he should wear on Palm Sunday.These nine suits of harness, of
such large size, are for the leichtach, from whom so much is expected.""And these goodly deer hides," said Simon, the spirit of his profession
awakening at the sight of the goods in which he traded--"think you the
chief will be disposed to chaffer for them?They are in demand for the
doublets which knights wear under their armour.""Did I not pray you," said Niel Booshalloch, "to say nothing on that
subject?""It is the mail shirts I speak of," said Simon--"may I ask if any of
them were made by our celebrated Perth armourer, called Henry of the
Wynd?""Thou art more unlucky than before," said Niel, "that man's name is to
Eachin's temper like a whirlwind upon the lake; yet no man knows for
what cause.""I can guess," thought our glover, but gave no utterance to the thought;
and, having twice lighted on unpleasant subjects of conversation, he
prepared to apply himself, like those around him, to his food, without
starting another topic.We have said as much of the preparations as may lead the reader to
conclude that the festival, in respect of the quality of the food, was
of the most rude description, consisting chiefly of huge joints of meat,
which were consumed with little respect to the fasting season, although
several of the friars of the island convent graced and hallowed the
board by their presence.The platters were of wood, and so were the
hooped cogues or cups out of which the guests quaffed their liquor, as
also the broth or juice of the meat, which was held a delicacy.There
were also various preparations of milk which were highly esteemed, and
were eaten out of similar vessels.Bread was the scarcest article at the
banquet, but the glover and his patron Niel were served with two small
loaves expressly for their own use.In eating, as, indeed, was then the
case all over Britain, the guests used their knives called skenes, or
the large poniards named dirks, without troubling themselves by the
reflection that they might occasionally have served different or more
fatal purposes.At the upper end of the table stood a vacant seat, elevated a step or
two above the floor.It was covered with a canopy of hollow boughs and
ivy, and there rested against it a sheathed sword and a folded banner.This had been the seat of the deceased chieftain, and was left vacant
in honour of him.Eachin occupied a lower chair on the right hand of the
place of honour.The reader would be greatly mistaken who should follow out this
description by supposing that the guests behaved like a herd of hungry
wolves, rushing upon a feast rarely offered to them.On the contrary,
the Clan Quhele conducted themselves with that species of courteous
reserve and attention to the wants of others which is often found in
primitive nations, especially such as are always in arms, because a
general observance of the rules of courtesy is necessary to prevent
quarrels, bloodshed, and death.The guests took the places assigned them
by Torquil of the Oak, who, acting as marischal taeh, i.e.sewer of
the mess, touched with a white wand, without speaking a word, the place
where each was to sit.Thus placed in order, the company patiently
waited for the portion assigned them, which was distributed among them
by the leichtach; the bravest men or more distinguished warriors of
the tribe being accommodated with a double mess, emphatically called
bieyfir, or the portion of a man.When the sewers themselves had seen
every one served, they resumed their places at the festival, and were
each served with one of these larger messes of food.Water was placed
within each man's reach, and a handful of soft moss served the purposes
of a table napkin, so that, as at an Eastern banquet, the hands were
washed as often as the mess was changed.For amusement, the bard recited
the praises of the deceased chief, and expressed the clan's confidence
in the blossoming virtues of his successor.The seannachie recited the
genealogy of the tribe, which they traced to the race of the Dalriads;
the harpers played within, while the war pipes cheered the multitude
without.The conversation among the guests was grave, subdued, and
civil; no jest was attempted beyond the bounds of a very gentle
pleasantry, calculated only to excite a passing smile.There were no
raised voices, no contentious arguments; and Simon Glover had heard a
hundred times more noise at a guild feast in Perth than was made on this
occasion by two hundred wild mountaineers.Even the liquor itself did not seem to raise the festive party above the
same tone of decorous gravity.Wine appeared in
very small quantities, and was served out only to the principal guests,
among which honoured number Simon Glover was again included.The wine
and the two wheaten loaves were indeed the only marks of notice which he
received during the feast; but Niel Booshalloch, jealous of his master's
reputation for hospitality, failed not to enlarge on them as proofs
of high distinction.Distilled liquors, since so generally used in
the Highlands, were then comparatively unknown.The usquebaugh was
circulated in small quantities, and was highly flavoured with a
decoction of saffron and other herbs, so as to resemble a medicinal
potion rather than a festive cordial.Cider and mead were seen at the
entertainment, but ale, brewed in great quantities for the purpose, and
flowing round without restriction, was the liquor generally used, and
that was drunk with a moderation much less known among the more modern
Highlanders.A cup to the memory of the deceased chieftain was the first
pledge solemnly proclaimed after the banquet was finished, and a low
murmur of benedictions was heard from the company, while the monks
alone, uplifting their united voices, sung Requiem eternam dona.An
unusual silence followed, as if something extraordinary was expected,
when Eachin arose with a bold and manly, yet modest, grace, and ascended
the vacant seat or throne, saying with dignity and firmness:

"This seat and my father's inheritance I claim as my right--so prosper
me God and St."How will you rule your father's children?"said an old man, the uncle
of the deceased."I will defend them with my father's sword, and distribute justice to
them under my father's banner."The old man, with a trembling hand, unsheathed the ponderous weapon,
and, holding it by the blade, offered the hilt to the young chieftain's
grasp; at the same time Torquil of the Oak unfurled the pennon of the
tribe, and swung it repeatedly over Eachin's head, who, with singular
grace and dexterity, brandished the huge claymore as in its defence.The guests raised a yelling shout to testify their acceptance of the
patriarchal chief who claimed their allegiance, nor was there any who,
in the graceful and agile youth before them, was disposed to recollect
the subject of sinister vaticinations.As he stood in glittering mail,
resting on the long sword, and acknowledging by gracious gestures the
acclamations which rent the air within, without, and around, Simon
Glover was tempted to doubt whether this majestic figure was that of the
same lad whom he had often treated with little ceremony, and began to
have some apprehension of the consequences of having done so.A
general burst of minstrelsy succeeded to the acclamations, and rock and
greenwood rang to harp and pipes, as lately to shout and yell of woe.It would be tedious to pursue the progress of the inaugural feast, or
detail the pledges that were quaffed to former heroes of the clan, and
above all to the twenty-nine brave galloglasses who were to fight in the
approaching conflict, under the eye and leading of their young chief.The bards, assuming in old times the prophetic character combined with
their own, ventured to assure them of the most distinguished victory,
and to predict the fury with which the blue falcon, the emblem of the
Clan Quhele, should rend to pieces the mountain cat, the well known
badge of the Clan Chattan.It was approaching sunset when a bowl, called the grace cup, made of
oak, hooped with silver, was handed round the table as the signal of
dispersion, although it was left free to any who chose a longer carouse
to retreat to any of the outer bothies.As for Simon Glover, the
Booshalloch conducted him to a small hut, contrived, it would seem,
for the use of a single individual, where a bed of heath and moss was
arranged as well as the season would permit, and an ample supply of
such delicacies as the late feast afforded showed that all care had been
taken for the inhabitant's accommodation."Do not leave this hut," said the Booshalloch, taking leave of his
friend and protege: "this is your place of rest.But apartments are lost
on such a night of confusion, and if the badger leaves his hole the toad
will creep into it."To Simon Glover this arrangement was by no means disagreeable.He had
been wearied by the noise of the day, and felt desirous of repose.After
eating, therefore, a morsel, which his appetite scarce required, and
drinking a cup of wine to expel the cold, he muttered his evening
prayer, wrapt himself in his cloak, and lay down on a couch which old
acquaintance had made familiar and easy to him.The hum and murmur,
and even the occasional shouts, of some of the festive multitude who
continued revelling without did not long interrupt his repose, and in
about ten minutes he was as fast asleep as if he had lain in his own bed
in Curfew Street.Two hours before the black cock crew, Simon Glover was wakened by a well
known voice, which called him by name.he replied, as he started from sleep, "is the morning
so far advanced?"and, raising his eyes, the person of whom he was
dreaming stood before him; and at the same moment, the events of
yesterday rushing on his recollection, he saw with surprise that the
vision retained the form which sleep had assigned it, and it was not the
mail clad Highland chief, with claymore in hand, as he had seen him
the preceding night, but Conachar of Curfew Street, in his humble
apprentice's garb, holding in his hand a switch of oak.An apparition
would not more have surprised our Perth burgher.As he gazed with
wonder, the youth turned upon him a piece of lighted bog wood which he
carried in a lantern, and to his waking exclamation replied:

"Even so, father Simon: it is Conachar, come to renew our old
acquaintance, when our intercourse will attract least notice."So saying, he sat down on a tressel which answered the purpose of
a chair, and placing the lantern beside him, proceeded in the most
friendly tone:

"I have tasted of thy good cheer many a day, father Simon; I trust thou
hast found no lack in my family?""None whatever, Eachin MacIan," answered the glover, for the simplicity
of the Celtic language and manners rejects all honorary titles; "it was
even too good for this fasting season, and much too good for me, since I
must be ashamed to think how hard you fared in Curfew Street.""Even too well, to use your own word," said Conachar, "for the deserts
of an idle apprentice and for the wants of a young Highlander.But
yesterday, if there was, as I trust, enough of food, found you not, good
glover, some lack of courteous welcome?Excuse it not--I know you did
so.But I am young in authority with my people, and I must not too early
draw their attention to the period of my residence in the Lowlands,
which, however, I can never forget.""I understand the cause entirely," said Simon; "and therefore it is
unwillingly, and as it were by force, that I have made so early a visit
hither."It is well you are come to see some of my Highland
splendour while it yet sparkles.Return after Palm Sunday, and who knows
whom or what you may find in the territories we now possess!The
wildcat may have made his lodge where the banqueting bower of MacIan now
stands."The young chief was silent, and pressed the top of the rod to his lips,
as if to guard against uttering more."There is no fear of that, Eachin," said Simon, in that vague way in
which lukewarm comforters endeavour to turn the reflections of their
friends from the consideration of inevitable danger."There is fear, and there is peril of utter ruin," answered Eachin, "and
there is positive certainty of great loss.I marvel my father consented
to this wily proposal of Albany.I would MacGillie Chattanach would
agree with me, and then, instead of wasting our best blood against
each other, we would go down together to Strathmore and kill and take
possession.I would rule at Perth and he at Dundee, and all the great
strath should be our own to the banks of the Firth of Tay.Such is the
policy I have caught from your old grey head, father Simon, when holding
a trencher at thy back, and listening to thy evening talk with Bailie
Craigdallie.""The tongue is well called an unruly member," thought the glover."Here have I been holding a candle to the devil, to show him the way to
mischief."But he only said aloud: "These plans come too late.""The indentures of battle are signed
by our marks and seals, the burning hate of the Clan Quhele and Clan
Chattan is blown up to an inextinguishable flame by mutual insults and
boasts.But to thine own affairs, father
Glover.It is religion that has brought thee hither, as I learn from
Niel Booshalloch.Surely, my experience of thy prudence did not lead
me to suspect thee of any quarrel with Mother Church.As for my old
acquaintance, Father Clement, he is one of those who hunt after the
crown of martyrdom, and think a stake, surrounded with blazing fagots,
better worth embracing than a willing bride.He is a very knight errant
in defence of his religious notions, and does battle wherever he comes.He hath already a quarrel with the monks of Sibyl's Isle yonder about
some point of doctrine."I have," answered Simon; "but we spoke little together, the time being
pressing.""He may have said that there is a third person--one more likely, I
think, to be a true fugitive for religion than either you, a shrewd
citizen, or he, a wrangling preacher--who would be right heartily
welcome to share our protection?Thou art dull, man, and wilt not guess
my meaning--thy daughter, Catharine."These last words the young chief spoke in English; and he continued the
conversation in that language, as if apprehensive of being overheard,
and, indeed, as if under the sense of some involuntary hesitation."My daughter Catharine," said the glover, remembering what the
Carthusian had told him, "is well and safe.""And wherefore came she
not with you?Think you the Clan Quhele have no cailliachs as active as
old Dorothy, whose hand has warmed my haffits before now, to wait upon
the daughter of their chieftain's master?""Again I thank you," said the glover, "and doubt neither your power nor
your will to protect my daughter, as well as myself.But an honourable
lady, the friend of Sir Patrick Charteris, hath offered her a safe place
of refuge without the risk of a toilsome journey through a desolate and
distracted country.""Oh, ay, Sir Patrick Charteris," said Eachin, in a more reserved and
distant tone; "he must be preferred to all men, without doubt.Simon Glover longed to punish this affectation of a boy who had been
scolded four times a day for running into the street to see Sir Patrick
Charteris ride past; but he checked his spirit of repartee, and simply
said:

"Sir Patrick Charteris has been provost of Perth for seven years, and it
is likely is so still, since the magistrates are elected, not in Lent,
but at St."Ah, father Glover," said the youth, in his kinder and more familiar
mode of address, "you are so used to see the sumptuous shows and
pageants of Perth, that you would but little relish our barbarous
festival in comparison.What didst thou think of our ceremonial of
yesterday?""It was noble and touching," said the glover; "and to me, who knew your
father, most especially so.When you rested on the sword and looked
around you, methought I saw mine old friend Gilchrist MacIan arisen from
the dead and renewed in years and in strength.""I played my part there boldly, I trust; and showed little of that
paltry apprentice boy whom you used to--use just as he deserved?""Eachin resembles Conachar," said the glover, "no more than a salmon
resembles a gar, though men say they are the same fish in a different
state, or than a butterfly resembles a grub.""Thinkest thou that, while I was taking upon me the power which all
women love, I would have been myself an object for a maiden's eye to
rest upon?To speak plain, what would Catharine have thought of me in
the ceremonial?""We approach the shallows now," thought Simon Glover, "and without nice
pilotage we drive right on shore.""Most women like show, Eachin; but I think my daughter Catharine be an
exception.She would rejoice in the good fortune of her household friend
and playmate; but she would not value the splendid MacIan, captain of
Clan Quhele, more than the orphan Conachar.""She is ever generous and disinterested," replied the young chief."But
yourself, father, have seen the world for many more years than she has
done, and can better form a judgment what power and wealth do for those
who enjoy them.Think, and speak sincerely, what would be your own
thoughts if you saw your Catharine standing under yonder canopy, with
the command over an hundred hills, and the devoted obedience of ten
thousand vassals; and as the price of these advantages, her hand in that
of the man who loves her the best in the world?""Meaning in your own, Conachar?""Ay, Conachar call me: I love the name, since it was by that I have been
known to Catharine.""Sincerely, then," said the glover, endeavouring to give the least
offensive turn to his reply, "my inmost thought would be the earnest
wish that Catharine and I were safe in our humble booth in Curfew
Street, with Dorothy for our only vassal.""And with poor Conachar also, I trust?You would not leave him to pine
away in solitary grandeur?""I would not," answered the glover, "wish so ill to the Clan Quhele,
mine ancient friends, as to deprive them, at the moment of emergency,
of a brave young chief, and that chief of the fame which he is about to
acquire at their head in the approaching conflict."Eachin bit his lip to suppress his irritated feelings as he replied:
"Words--words--empty words, father Simon.You fear the Clan Quhele
more than you love them, and you suppose their indignation would be
formidable should their chief marry the daughter of a burgess of Perth.""And if I do fear such an issue, Hector MacIan, have I not reason?How
have ill assorted marriages had issue in the house of MacCallanmore,
in that of the powerful MacLeans--nay, of the Lords of the Isles
themselves?What has ever come of them but divorce and exheredation,
sometimes worse fate, to the ambitious intruder?You could not marry my
child before a priest, and you could only wed her with your left
hand; and I--" he checked the strain of impetuosity which the subject
inspired, and concluded, "and I am an honest though humble burgher of
Perth, who would rather my child were the lawful and undoubted spouse of
a citizen in my own rank than the licensed concubine of a monarch.""I will wed Catharine before the priest and before the world, before
the altar and before the black stones of Iona," said the impetuous young
man."She is the love of my youth, and there is not a tie in religion or
honour but I will bind myself by them!If
we do but win this combat--and, with the hope of gaining Catharine, we
SHALL win it--my heart tells me so--I shall be so much lord over their
affections that, were I to take a bride from the almshouse, so it was
my pleasure, they would hail her as if she were a daughter of
MacCallanmore."You put words of offence in my mouth," said the old man, "and may next
punish me for them, since I am wholly in your power.But with my consent
my daughter shall never wed save in her own degree.Her heart would
break amid the constant wars and scenes of bloodshed which connect
themselves with your lot.If you really love her, and recollect her
dread of strife and combat, you would not wish her to be subjected to
the train of military horrors in which you, like your father, must
needs be inevitably and eternally engaged.Choose a bride amongst the
daughters of the mountain chiefs, my son, or fiery Lowland nobles.You
are fair, young, rich, high born, and powerful, and will not woo in
vain.You will readily find one who will rejoice in your conquests, and
cheer you under defeat.To Catharine, the one would be as frightful
as the other.A warrior must wear a steel gauntlet: a glove of kidskin
would be torn to pieces in an hour."A dark cloud passed over the face of the young chief, lately animated
with so much fire."Farewell," he said, "the only hope which could have lighted me to fame
or victory!"He remained for a space silent, and intensely thoughtful, with downcast
eyes, a lowering brow, and folded arms.At length he raised his hands,
and said: "Father,--for such you have been to me--I am about to tell you
a secret.Reason and pride both advise me to be silent, but fate urges
me, and must be obeyed.I am about to lodge in you the deepest and
dearest secret that man ever confided to man.But beware--end this
conference how it will--beware how you ever breathe a syllable of what
I am now to trust to you; for know that, were you to do so in the most
remote corner of Scotland, I have ears to hear it even there, and a
hand and poniard to reach a traitor's bosom.I am--but the word will not
out!""Do not speak it then," said the prudent glover: "a secret is no longer
safe when it crosses the lips of him who owns it, and I desire not a
confidence so dangerous as you menace me with.""Ay, but I must speak, and you must hear," said the youth."In this age
of battle, father, you have yourself been a combatant?""Once only," replied Simon, "when the Southron assaulted the Fair City.I was summoned to take my part in the defence, as my tenure required,
like that of other craftsmen, who are bound to keep watch and ward.""What can that import to the present business?""Much, else I had not asked the question," answered.Eachin, in the tone
of haughtiness which from time to time he assumed."An old man is easily brought to speak of olden times," said Simon, not
unwilling, on an instant's reflection, to lead the conversation away
from the subject of his daughter, "and I must needs confess my feelings
were much short of the high, cheerful confidence, nay, the pleasure,
with which I have seen other men go to battle.My life and profession
were peaceful, and though I have not wanted the spirit of a man, when
the time demanded it, yet I have seldom slept worse than the night
before that onslaught.My ideas were harrowed by the tales we were
told--nothing short of the truth--about the Saxon archers: how they drew
shafts of a cloth yard length, and used bows a third longer than ours.When I fell into a broken slumber, if but a straw in the mattress
pricked my side I started and waked, thinking an English arrow was
quivering in my body.In the morning, as I began for very weariness to
sink into some repose, I was waked by the tolling of the common bell,
which called us burghers to the walls; I never heard its sound peal so
like a passing knell before or since.""I did on my harness," said Simon, "such as it was; took my mother's
blessing, a high spirited woman, who spoke of my father's actions for
the honour of the Fair Town.This heartened me, and I felt still bolder
when I found myself ranked among the other crafts, all bowmen, for thou
knowest the Perth citizens have good skill in archery.We were dispersed
on the walls, several knights and squires in armour of proof being
mingled amongst us, who kept a bold countenance, confident perhaps in
their harness, and informed us, for our encouragement, that they would
cut down with their swords and axes any of those who should attempt to
quit their post.I was kindly assured of this myself by the old Kempe
of Kinfauns, as he was called, this good Sir Patrick's father, then our
provost.He was a grandson of the Red Rover, Tom of Longueville, and
a likely man to keep his word, which he addressed to me in especial,
because a night of much discomfort may have made me look paler than
usual; and, besides, I was but a lad.""And did his exhortation add to your fear or your resolution?"said
Eachin, who seemed very attentive."To my resolution," answered Simon; "for I think nothing can make a
man so bold to face one danger at some distance in his front as the
knowledge of another close behind him, to push him forward.Well, I
mounted the walls in tolerable heart, and was placed with others on the
Spey Tower, being accounted a good bowman.But a very cold fit seized me
as I saw the English, in great order, with their archers in front,
and their men at arms behind, marching forward to the attack in strong
columns, three in number.They came on steadily, and some of us would
fain have shot at them; but it was strictly forbidden, and we were
obliged to remain motionless, sheltering ourselves behind the battlement
as we best might.As the Southron formed their long ranks into lines,
each man occupying his place as by magic, and preparing to cover
themselves by large shields, called pavesses, which they planted before
them, I again felt a strange breathlessness, and some desire to go home
for a glass of distilled waters.But as I looked aside, I saw the worthy
Kempe of Kinfauns bending a large crossbow, and I thought it pity he
should waste the bolt on a true hearted Scotsman, when so many English
were in presence; so I e'en staid where I was, being in a comfortable
angle, formed by two battlements.The English then strode forward, and
drew their bowstrings--not to the breast, as your Highland kerne do, but
to the ear--and sent off their volleys of swallow tails before we could
call on St.I winked when I saw them haul up their tackle, and I
believe I started as the shafts began to rattle against the parapet.But looking round me, and seeing none hurt but John Squallit, the town
crier, whose jaws were pierced through with a cloth yard shaft, I took
heart of grace, and shot in my turn with good will and good aim.A
little man I shot at, who had just peeped out from behind his target,
dropt with a shaft through his shoulder.The provost cried, 'Well
stitched, Simon Glover!'John, for his own town, my fellow
craftsmen!'shouted I, though I was then but an apprentice.And if you
will believe me, in the rest of the skirmish, which was ended by the
foes drawing off, I drew bowstring and loosed shaft as calmly as if
I had been shooting at butts instead of men's breasts.I gained
some credit, and I have ever afterwards thought that, in case of
necessity--for with me it had never been matter of choice--I should not
have lost it again.And this is all I can tell of warlike experience in
battle.Other dangers I have had, which I have endeavoured to avoid like
a wise man, or, when they were inevitable, I have faced them like a
true one.Upon other terms a man cannot live or hold up his head in
Scotland.""I understand your tale," said Eachin; "but I shall find it difficult
to make you credit mine, knowing the race of which I am descended, and
especially that I am the son of him whom we have this day laid in the
tomb--well that he lies where he will never learn what you are now to
hear!Look, my father, the light which I bear grows short and pale, a
few minutes will extinguish it; but before it expires, the hideous tale
will be told.Father, I am--a COWARD!It is said at last, and the secret
of my disgrace is in keeping of another!"The young man sunk back in a species of syncope, produced by the agony
of his mind as he made the fatal communication.The glover, moved as
well by fear as by compassion, applied himself to recall him to life,
and succeeded in doing so, but not in restoring him to composure.He hid
his face with his hands, and his tears flowed plentifully and bitterly."For Our Lady's sake, be composed," said the old man, "and recall the
vile word!I know you better than yourself: you are no coward, but only
too young and inexperienced, ay, and somewhat too quick of fancy, to
have the steady valour of a bearded man.I would hear no other man say
that of you, Conachar, without giving him the lie.You are no coward:
I have seen high sparks of spirit fly from you even on slight enough
provocation."said the unfortunate youth; "but
when saw you them supported by the resolution that should have backed
them?The sparks you speak of fell on my dastardly heart as on a piece
of ice which could catch fire from nothing: if my offended pride urged
me to strike, my weakness of mind prompted me the next moment to fly.""Want of habit," said Simon; "it is by clambering over walls that youths
learn to scale precipices.Begin with slight feuds; exercise daily the
arms of your country in tourney with your followers."exclaimed the young chief,
starting as if something horrid had occurred to his imagination."How
many days are there betwixt this hour and Palm Sunday, and what is to
chance then?A list inclosed, from which no man can stir, more than the
poor bear who is chained to his stake.Sixty living men, the best
and fiercest--one alone excepted!--which Albyn can send down from her
mountains, all athirst for each other's blood, while a king and his
nobles, and shouting thousands besides, attend, as at a theatre, to
encourage their demoniac fury!Blows clang and blood flows, thicker,
faster, redder; they rush on each other like madmen, they tear each
other like wild beasts; the wounded are trodden to death amid the feet
of their companions!Blood ebbs, arms become weak; but there must be
no parley, no truce, no interruption, while any of the maimed wretches
remain alive!Here is no crouching behind battlements, no fighting with
missile weapons: all is hand to hand, till hands can no longer be raised
to maintain the ghastly conflict!If such a field is so horrible in
idea, what think you it will be in reality?""I can only pity you, Conachar," said Simon."It is hard to be the
descendant of a lofty line--the son of a noble father--the leader by
birth of a gallant array, and yet to want, or think you want, for
still I trust the fault lies much in a quick fancy, that over estimates
danger--to want that dogged quality which is possessed by every game
cock that is worth a handful of corn, every hound that is worth a
mess of offal.But how chanced it that, with such a consciousness of
inability to fight in this battle, you proffered even now to share your
chiefdom with my daughter?Your power must depend on your fighting this
combat, and in that Catharine cannot help you.""You mistake, old man," replied Eachin: "were Catharine to look kindly
on the earnest love I bear her, it would carry me against the front of
the enemies with the mettle of a war horse.Overwhelming as my sense
of weakness is, the feeling that Catharine looked on would give me
strength.Say yet--oh, say yet--she shall be mine if we gain the combat,
and not the Gow Chrom himself, whose heart is of a piece with his
anvil, ever went to battle so light as I shall do!One strong passion is
conquered by another."Cannot the recollection of your interest, your
honour, your kindred, do as much to stir your courage as the thoughts of
a brent browed lass?"You tell me but what I have told myself, but it is in vain," replied
Eachin, with a sigh."It is only whilst the timid stag is paired with
the doe that he is desperate and dangerous.Be it from constitution; be
it, as our Highland cailliachs will say, from the milk of the white
doe; be it from my peaceful education and the experience of your strict
restraint; be it, as you think, from an overheated fancy, which paints
danger yet more dangerous and ghastly than it is in reality, I cannot
tell.But I know my failing, and--yes, it must be said!--so sorely dread
that I cannot conquer it, that, could I have your consent to my wishes
on such terms, I would even here make a pause, renounce the rank I have
assumed, and retire into humble life.""What, turn glover at last, Conachar?""This beats the
legend of St.Nay--nay, your hand was not framed for that: you
shall spoil me no more doe skins.""Jest not," said Eachin, "I am serious.If I cannot labour, I will bring
wealth enough to live without it.They will proclaim me recreant with
horn and war pipe.Catharine will love me the better
that I have preferred the paths of peace to those of bloodshed, and
Father Clement shall teach us to pity and forgive the world, which will
load us with reproaches that wound not.I shall be the happiest of men;
Catharine will enjoy all that unbounded affection can confer upon her,
and will be freed from apprehension of the sights and sounds of horror
which your ill assorted match would have prepared for her; and you,
father Glover, shall occupy your chimney corner, the happiest and most
honoured man that ever--"

"Hold, Eachin--I prithee, hold," said the glover; "the fir light, with
which this discourse must terminate, burns very low, and I would speak
a word in my turn, and plain dealing is best.Though it may vex,
or perhaps enrage, you, let me end these visions by saying at once:
Catharine can never be yours.A glove is the emblem of faith, and a
man of my craft should therefore less than any other break his own.Catharine's hand is promised--promised to a man whom you may hate, but
whom you must honour--to Henry the armourer.The match is fitting by
degree, agreeable to their mutual wishes, and I have given my promise.It is best to be plain at once; resent my refusal as you will--I am
wholly in your power.The glover spoke thus decidedly, because he was aware from experience
that the very irritable disposition of his former apprentice yielded in
most cases to stern and decided resolution.Yet, recollecting where he
was, it was with some feelings of fear that he saw the dying flame leap
up and spread a flash of light on the visage of Eachin, which seemed
pale as the grave, while his eye rolled like that of a maniac in his
fever fit.The light instantly sunk down and died, and Simon felt a
momentary terror lest he should have to dispute for his life with
the youth, whom he knew to be capable of violent actions when highly
excited, however short a period his nature could support the measures
which his passion commenced.He was relieved by the voice of Eachin, who
muttered in a hoarse and altered tone:

"Let what we have spoken this night rest in silence for ever.If thou
bring'st it to light, thou wert better dig thine own grave."Thus speaking, the door of the hut opened, admitting a gleam of
moonshine.The form of the retiring chief crossed it for an instant, the
hurdle was then closed, and the shieling left in darkness.Simon Glover felt relieved when a conversation fraught with offence and
danger was thus peaceably terminated.But he remained deeply affected by
the condition of Hector MacIan, whom he had himself bred up."The poor child," said he, "to be called up to a place of eminence,
only to be hurled from it with contempt!What he told me I partly knew,
having often remarked that Conachar was more prone to quarrel than to
fight.But this overpowering faint heartedness, which neither shame
nor necessity can overcome, I, though no Sir William Wallace, cannot
conceive.And to propose himself for a husband to my daughter, as if
a bride were to find courage for herself and the bridegroom!No--no,
Catharine must wed a man to whom she may say, 'Husband, spare your
enemy'--not one in whose behalf she must cry, 'Generous enemy, spare my
husband!"Tired out with these reflections, the old man at length fell asleep.In the morning he was awakened by his friend the Booshalloch, who, with
something of a blank visage, proposed to him to return to his abode on
the meadow at the Ballough.He apologised that the chief could not see
Simon Glover that morning, being busied with things about the expected
combat; and that Eachin MacIan thought the residence at the Ballough
would be safest for Simon Glover's health, and had given charge that
every care should be taken for his protection and accommodation.Niel Booshalloch dilated on these circumstances, to gloss over the
neglect implied in the chief's dismissing his visitor without a
particular audience."His father knew better," said the herdsman."But where should he have
learned manners, poor thing, and bred up among your Perth burghers, who,
excepting yourself, neighbour Glover, who speak Gaelic as well as I do,
are a race incapable of civility?"Simon Glover, it may be well believed, felt none of the want of respect
which his friend resented on his account.On the contrary, he greatly
preferred the quiet residence of the good herdsman to the tumultuous
hospitality of the daily festival of the chief, even if there had not
just passed an interview with Eachin upon a subject which it would be
most painful to revive.To the Ballough, therefore, he quietly retreated, where, could he have
been secure of Catharine's safety, his leisure was spent pleasantly
enough.His amusement was sailing on the lake in a little skiff, which a
Highland boy managed, while the old man angled.He frequently landed
on the little island, where he mused over the tomb of his old friend
Gilchrist MacIan, and made friends with the monks, presenting the prior
with gloves of martens' fur, and the superior officers with each of them
a pair made from the skin of the wildcat.The cutting and stitching of
these little presents served to beguile the time after sunset, while
the family of the herdsman crowded around, admiring his address, and
listening to the tales and songs with which the old man had skill to
pass away a heavy evening.It must be confessed that the cautious glover avoided the conversation
of Father Clement, whom he erroneously considered as rather the author
of his misfortunes than the guiltless sharer of them."I will not," he
thought, "to please his fancies, lose the goodwill of these kind
monks, which may be one day useful to me.I have suffered enough by his
preachments already, I trow.Little the wiser and much the poorer they
have made me.No--no, Catharine and Clement may think as they will; but
I will take the first opportunity to sneak back like a rated hound at
the call of his master, submit to a plentiful course of haircloth and
whipcord, disburse a lusty mulct, and become whole with the church
again."More than a fortnight had passed since the glover had arrived at
Ballough, and he began to wonder that he had not heard news of Catharine
or of Henry Wynd, to whom he concluded the provost had communicated the
plan and place of his retreat.He knew the stout smith dared not come
up into the Clan Quhele country, on account of various feuds with
the inhabitants, and with Eachin himself, while bearing the name of
Conachar; but yet the glover thought Henry might have found means to
send him a message, or a token, by some one of the various couriers who
passed and repassed between the court and the headquarters of the Clan
Quhele, in order to concert the terms of the impending combat, the
march of the parties to Perth, and other particulars requiring previous
adjustment.It was now the middle of March, and the fatal Palm Sunday
was fast approaching.Whilst time was thus creeping on, the exiled glover had not even once
set eyes upon his former apprentice.The care that was taken to attend
to his wants and convenience in every respect showed that he was not
forgotten; but yet, when he heard the chieftain's horn ringing through
the woods, he usually made it a point to choose his walk in a different
direction.One morning, however, he found himself unexpectedly in
Eachin's close neighbourhood, with scarce leisure to avoid him, and thus
it happened.As Simon strolled pensively through a little silvan glade, surrounded
on either side with tall forest trees, mixed with underwood, a white doe
broke from the thicket, closely pursued by two deer greyhounds, one
of which griped her haunch, the other her throat, and pulled her down
within half a furlong of the glover, who was something startled at the
suddenness of the incident.The ear and piercing blast of a horn, and
the baying of a slow hound, made Simon aware that the hunters were close
behind, and on the trace of the deer.Hallooing and the sound of
men running through the copse were heard close at hand.A moment's
recollection would have satisfied Simon that his best way was to stand
fast, or retire slowly, and leave it to Eachin to acknowledge his
presence or not, as he should see cause.But his desire of shunning the
young man had grown into a kind of instinct, and in the alarm of finding
him so near, Simon hid himself in a bush of hazels mixed with holly,
which altogether concealed him.He had hardly done so ere Eachin, rosy
with exercise, dashed from the thicket into the open glade, accompanied
by his foster father, Torquil of the Oak.The latter, with equal
strength and address, turned the struggling hind on her back, and
holding her forefeet in his right hand, while he knelt on her body,
offered his skene with the left to the young chief, that he might cut
the animal's throat."It may not be, Torquil; do thine office, and take the assay thyself.I
must not kill the likeness of my foster--"

This was spoken with a melancholy smile, while a tear at the same time
stood in the speaker's eye.Torquil stared at his young chief for an
instant, then drew his sharp wood knife across the creature's throat
with a cut so swift and steady that the weapon reached the backbone.Then rising on his feet, and again fixing a long piercing look on his
chief, he said: "As much as I have done to that hind would I do to any
living man whose ears could have heard my dault (foster son) so much as
name a white doe, and couple the word with Hector's name!"If Simon had no reason before to keep himself concealed, this speech of
Torquil furnished him with a pressing one."It cannot be concealed, father Torquil," said Eachin: "it will all out
to the broad day.""It is the fatal secret," thought Simon; "and now, if this huge privy
councillor cannot keep silence, I shall be made answerable, I suppose,
for Eachin's disgrace having been blown abroad."Thinking thus anxiously, he availed himself at the same time of his
position to see as much as he could of what passed between the afflicted
chieftain and his confidant, impelled by that spirit of curiosity which
prompts us in the most momentous, as well as the most trivial, occasions
of life, and which is sometimes found to exist in company with great
personal fear.As Torquil listened to what Eachin communicated, the young man sank
into his arms, and, supporting himself on his shoulder, concluded his
confession by a whisper into his ear.Torquil seemed to listen with such
amazement as to make him incapable of crediting his ears.As if to be
certain that it was Eachin who spoke, he gradually roused the youth from
his reclining posture, and, holding him up in some measure by a grasp on
his shoulder, fixed on him an eye that seemed enlarged, and at the same
time turned to stone, by the marvels he listened to.And so wild waxed
the old man's visage after he had heard the murmured communication,
that Simon Glover apprehended he would cast the youth from him as a
dishonoured thing, in which case he might have lighted among the very
copse in which he lay concealed, and occasioned his discovery in a
manner equally painful and dangerous.But the passions of Torquil,
who entertained for his foster child even a double portion of that
passionate fondness which always attends that connexion in the Highlands
took a different turn."I believe it not," he exclaimed; "it is false of thy father's child,
false of thy mother's son, falsest of my dault!I offer my gage to
heaven and hell, and will maintain the combat with him that shall call
it true.Thou hast been spellbound by an evil eye, my darling, and the
fainting which you call cowardice is the work of magic.I remember the
bat that struck the torch out on the hour that thou wert born--that hour
of grief and of joy.Thou shalt with me to Iona,
and the good St.Columbus, with the whole choir of blessed saints and
angels, who ever favoured thy race, shall take from thee the heart of
the white doe and return that which they have stolen from thee."Eachin listened, with a look as if he would fain have believed the words
of the comforter."But, Torquil," he said, "supposing this might avail us, the fatal day
approaches, and if I go to the lists, I dread me we shall be shamed.""Hell shall not prevail so
far: we will steep thy sword in holy water, place vervain, St.John's
Wort, and rowan tree in thy crest.We will surround thee, I and thy
eight brethren: thou shalt be safe as in a castle."Again the youth helplessly uttered something, which, from the dejected
tone in which it was spoken, Simon could not understand, while Torquil's
deep tones in reply fell full and distinct upon his ear."Yes, there may be a chance of withdrawing thee from the conflict.Thou
art the youngest who is to draw blade.Now, hear me, and thou shalt know
what it is to have a foster father's love, and how far it exceeds the
love even of kinsmen.The youngest on the indenture of the Clan Chattan
is Ferquhard Day.His father slew mine, and the red blood is seething
hot between us; I looked to Palm Sunday as the term that should cool it.Thou wouldst have thought that the blood in the veins of this
Ferquhard Day and in mine would not have mingled had they been put into
the same vessel, yet hath he cast the eyes of his love upon my only
daughter Eva, the fairest of our maidens.Think with what feelings I
heard the news.It was as if a wolf from the skirts of Farragon had
said, 'Give me thy child in wedlock, Torquil.'My child thought not
thus: she loves Ferquhard, and weeps away her colour and strength in
dread of the approaching battle.Let her give him but a sign of favour,
and well I know he will forget kith and kin, forsake the field, and fly
with her to the desert.""He, the youngest of the champions of Clan Chattan, being absent, I, the
youngest of the Clan Quhele, may be excused from combat" said Eachin,
blushing at the mean chance of safety thus opened to him."See now, my chief;" said Torquil, "and judge my thoughts towards
thee: others might give thee their own lives and that of their sons--I
sacrifice to thee the honour of my house.""My friend--my father," repeated the chief, folding Torquil to his
bosom, "what a base wretch am I that have a spirit dastardly enough to
avail myself of your sacrifice!"Let us back to the camp, and
send our gillies for the venison.The slowhound, or lyme dog, luckily for Simon, had drenched his nose in
the blood of the deer, else he might have found the glover's lair in the
thicket; but its more acute properties of scent being lost, it followed
tranquilly with the gazehounds.When the hunters were out of sight and hearing, the glover arose,
greatly relieved by their departure, and began to move off in the
opposite direction as fast as his age permitted.His first reflection
was on the fidelity of the foster father."The wild mountain heart is faithful and true.Yonder man is more like
the giants in romaunts than a man of mould like ourselves; and yet
Christians might take an example from him for his lealty.A simple
contrivance this, though, to finger a man from off their enemies'
chequer, as if there would not be twenty of the wildcats ready to supply
his place."Thus thought the glover, not aware that the strictest proclamations
were issued, prohibiting any of the two contending clans, their friends,
allies, and dependants, from coming within fifty miles of Perth, during
a week before and a week after the combat, which regulation was to be
enforced by armed men.So soon as our friend Simon arrived at the habitation of the herdsman,
he found other news awaiting him.They were brought by Father Clement,
who came in a pilgrim's cloak, or dalmatic, ready to commence his return
to the southward, and desirous to take leave of his companion in exile,
or to accept him as a travelling companion."But what," said the citizen, "has so suddenly induced you to return
within the reach of danger?""Have you not heard," said Father Clement, "that, March and his English
allies having retired into England before the Earl of Douglas, the good
earl has applied himself to redress the evils of the commonwealth, and
hath written to the court letters desiring that the warrant for the High
Court of Commission against heresy be withdrawn, as a trouble to men's
consciences, that the nomination of Henry of Wardlaw to be prelate of
St.Andrews be referred to the Parliament, with sundry other things
pleasing to the Commons?Now, most of the nobles that are with the King
at Perth, and with them Sir Patrick Charteris, your worthy provost, have
declared for the proposals of the Douglas.The Duke of Albany had agreed
to them--whether from goodwill or policy I know not.The good King is
easily persuaded to mild and gentle courses.And thus are the jaw
teeth of the oppressors dashed to pieces in their sockets, and the prey
snatched from their ravening talons.Will you with me to the Lowlands,
or do you abide here a little space?"Neil Booshalloch saved his friend the trouble of reply."He had the chief's authority," he said, "for saying that Simon Glover
should abide until the champions went down to the battle."In this answer the citizen saw something not quite consistent with his
own perfect freedom of volition; but he cared little for it at the
time, as it furnished a good apology for not travelling along with the
clergyman."An exemplary man," he said to his friend Niel Booshalloch, as soon as
Father Clement had taken leave--"a great scholar and a great saint.It
is a pity almost he is no longer in danger to be burned, as his sermon
at the stake would convert thousands.O Niel Booshalloch, Father
Clement's pile would be a sweet savouring sacrifice and a beacon to
all decent Christians!But what would the burning of a borrel ignorant
burgess like me serve?Men offer not up old glove leather for incense,
nor are beacons fed with undressed hides, I trow.Sooth to speak, I have
too little learning and too much fear to get credit by the affair, and,
therefore, I should, in our homely phrase, have both the scathe and the
scorn.""True for you," answered the herdsman.We must return to the characters of our dramatic narrative whom we
     left at Perth, when we accompanied the glover and his fair daughter
     to Kinfauns, and from that hospitable mansion traced the course of
     Simon to Loch Tay; and the Prince, as the highest personage, claims
     our immediate attention.This rash and inconsiderate young man endured with some impatience his
sequestered residence with the Lord High Constable, with whose company,
otherwise in every respect satisfactory, he became dissatisfied, from
no other reason than that he held in some degree the character of his
warder.Incensed against his uncle and displeased with his father, he
longed, not unnaturally, for the society of Sir John Ramorny, on whom he
had been so long accustomed to throw himself for amusement, and, though
he would have resented the imputation as an insult, for guidance and
direction.He therefore sent him a summons to attend him, providing his
health permitted; and directed him to come by water to a little pavilion
in the High Constable's garden, which, like that of Sir John's own
lodgings, ran down to the Tay.In renewing an intimacy so dangerous,
Rothsay only remembered that he had been Sir Join Ramorny's munificent
friend; while Sir John, on receiving the invitation, only recollected,
on his part, the capricious insults he had sustained from his patron,
the loss of his hand, and the lightness with which he had treated the
subject, and the readiness with which Rothsay had abandoned his cause in
the matter of the bonnet maker's slaughter.He laughed bitterly when he
read the Prince's billet."Eviot," he said, "man a stout boat with six trusty men--trusty men,
mark me--lose not a moment, and bid Dwining instantly come hither."Heaven smiles on us, my trusty friend," he said to the mediciner."I
was but beating my brains how to get access to this fickle boy, and here
he sends to invite me."I see the matter very clearly," said Dwining."Heaven smiles on
some untoward consequences--he!"No matter, the trap is ready; and it is baited, too, my friend, with
what would lure the boy from a sanctuary, though a troop with drawn
weapons waited him in the churchyard.His own weariness of himself would have done the job.Get thy matters
ready--thou goest with us.Write to him, as I cannot, that we come
instantly to attend his commands, and do it clerkly.He reads well, and
that he owes to me.""He will be your valiancie's debtor for more knowledge before he
dies--he!But is your bargain sure with the Duke of Albany?""Enough to gratify my ambition, thy avarice, and the revenge of both.Aboard--aboard, and speedily; let Eviot throw in a few flasks of the
choicest wine, and some cold baked meats.""But your arm, my lord, Sir John?"The throbbing of my heart silences the pain of my wound.It beats as it
would burst my bosom."said Dwining; adding, in a low voice--"It would be a
strange sight if it should.I should like to dissect it, save that its
stony case would spoil my best instruments."In a few minutes they were in the boat, while a speedy messenger carried
the note to the Prince.Rothsay was seated with the Constable, after their noontide repast.He
was sullen and silent; and the earl had just asked whether it was his
pleasure that the table should be cleared, when a note, delivered to the
Prince, changed at once his aspect."I go to the pavilion in the garden--always
with permission of my Lord Constable--to receive my late master of the
horse.""Ay, my lord; must I ask permission twice?""No, surely, my lord," answered the Constable; "but has your Royal
Highness recollected that Sir John Ramorny--"

"Has not the plague, I hope?""Come, Errol,
you would play the surly turnkey, but it is not in your nature; farewell
for half an hour."said Errol, as the Prince, flinging open a lattice of
the ground parlour in which they sat, stept out into the garden--"a new
folly, to call back that villain to his counsels.The Prince, in the mean time, looked back, and said hastily:

"Your lordship's good housekeeping will afford us a flask or two of
wine and a slight collation in the pavilion?I love the al fresco of the
river."The Constable bowed, and gave the necessary orders; so that Sir John
found the materials of good cheer ready displayed, when, landing from
his barge, he entered the pavilion."It grieves my heart to see your Highness under restraint," said
Ramorny, with a well executed appearance of sympathy."That grief of thine will grieve mine," said the Prince."I am sure here
has Errol, and a right true hearted lord he is, so tired me with grave
looks, and something like grave lessons, that he has driven me back to
thee, thou reprobate, from whom, as I expect nothing good, I may perhaps
obtain something entertaining.Yet, ere we say more, it was foul work,
that upon the Fastern's Even, Ramorny.I well hope thou gavest not aim
to it.""On my honour, my lord, a simple mistake of the brute Bonthron.I did
hint to him that a dry beating would be due to the fellow by whom I had
lost a hand; and lo you, my knave makes a double mistake.He takes one
man for another, and instead of the baton he uses the axe.""It is well that it went no farther.Small matter for the bonnet maker;
but I had never forgiven you had the armourer fallen--there is not his
match in Britain.But I hope they hanged the villain high enough?""If thirty feet might serve," replied Ramorny.no more of him," said Rothsay; "his wretched name makes the good
wine taste of blood.And what are the news in Perth, Ramorny?How stands
it with the bona robas and the galliards?""Little galliardise stirring, my lord," answered the knight."All eyes
are turned to the motions of the Black Douglas, who comes with five
thousand chosen men to put us all to rights, as if he were bound for
another Otterburn.It is said he is to be lieutenant again.It is
certain many have declared for his faction.""It is time, then, my feet were free," said Rothsay, "otherwise I may
find a worse warder than Errol."were you once away from this place, you might make as bold
a head as Douglas.""Ramorny," said the Prince, gravely, "I have but a confused remembrance
of your once having proposed something horrible to me.I would be free--I would have my person at my own disposal; but
I will never levy arms against my father, nor those it pleases him to
trust.""It was only for your Royal Highness's personal freedom that I was
presuming to speak," answered Ramorny."Were I in your Grace's place,
I would get me into that good boat which hovers on the Tay, and drop
quietly down to Fife, where you have many friends, and make free to take
possession of Falkland.It is a royal castle; and though the King has
bestowed it in gift on your uncle, yet surely, even if the grant were
not subject to challenge, your Grace might make free with the residence
of so near a relative.""He hath made free with mine," said the Duke, "as the stewartry of
Renfrew can tell.But stay, Ramorny--hold; did I not hear Errol say
that the Lady Marjory Douglas, whom they call Duchess of Rothsay, is
at Falkland?I would neither dwell with that lady nor insult her by
dislodging her.""The lady was there, my lord," replied Ramorny; "I have sure advice that
she is gone to meet her father."or perhaps to beg him to spare
me, providing I come on my knees to her bed, as pilgrims say the emirs
and amirals upon whom a Saracen soldan bestows a daughter in marriage
are bound to do?Ramorny, I will act by the Douglas's own saying, 'It
is better to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak.'I will keep both
foot and hand from fetters.""No place fitter than Falkland," replied Ramorny."I have enough of good
yeomen to keep the place; and should your Highness wish to leave it, a
brief ride reaches the sea in three directions."Neither mirth, music,
nor maidens--ha!""Pardon me, noble Duke; but, though the Lady Marjory Douglas be
departed, like an errant dame in romance, to implore succour of her
doughty sire, there is, I may say, a lovelier, I am sure a younger,
maiden, either presently at Falkland or who will soon be on the road
thither.Your Highness has not forgotten the Fair Maid of Perth?""Forget the prettiest wench in Scotland!No--any more than thou hast
forgotten the hand that thou hadst in the Curfew Street onslaught on St.Your Highness would say, the hand that I lost.As
certain as I shall never regain it, Catharine Glover is, or will soon
be, at Falkland.I will not flatter your Highness by saying she
expects to meet you; in truth, she proposes to place herself under the
protection of the Lady Marjory.""The little traitress," said the Prince--"she too to turn against me?"I trust your Grace will make her penance a gentle one," replied the
knight."Faith, I would have been her father confessor long ago, but I have ever
found her coy.""Opportunity was lacking, my lord," replied Ramorny; "and time presses
even now.""Nay, I am but too apt for a frolic; but my father--"

"He is personally safe," said Ramorny, "and as much at freedom as ever
he can be; while your Highness--"

"Must brook fetters, conjugal or literal--I know it.Yonder comes
Douglas, with his daughter in his hand, as haughty and as harsh featured
as himself, bating touches of age.""And at Falkland sits in solitude the fairest wench in Scotland," said
Ramorny."Here is penance and restraint, yonder is joy and freedom.""Thou hast prevailed, most sage counsellor," replied Rothsay; "but mark
you, it shall be the last of my frolics.""I trust so," replied Ramorny; "for, when at liberty, you may make a
good accommodation with your royal father.""I will write to him, Ramorny.No, I cannot
put my thoughts in words--do thou write.""Your Royal Highness forgets," said Ramorny, pointing to his mutilated
arm."So please your Highness," answered his counsellor, "if you would use
the hand of the mediciner, Dwining--he writes like a clerk.""Hath he a hint of the circumstances?"Fully," said Ramorny; and, stepping to the window, he called Dwining
from the boat.He entered the presence of the Prince of Scotland, creeping as if he
trode upon eggs, with downcast eyes, and a frame that seemed shrunk up
by a sense of awe produced by the occasion.I will make trial of you; thou
know'st the case--place my conduct to my father in a fair light."Dwining sat down, and in a few minutes wrote a letter, which he handed
to Sir John Ramorny."Why, the devil has aided thee, Dwining," said the knight.'Respected father and liege sovereign--Know that important
considerations induce me to take my departure from this your court,
purposing to make my abode at Falkland, both as the seat of my dearest
uncle Albany, with whom I know your Majesty would desire me to use all
familiarity, and as the residence of one from whom I have been too
long estranged, and with whom I haste to exchange vows of the closest
affection from henceforward.'"The Duke of Rothsay and Ramorny laughed aloud; and the physician,
who had listened to his own scroll as if it were a sentence of death,
encouraged by their applause, raised his eyes, uttered faintly his
chuckling note of "He!and was again grave and silent, as if afraid
he had transgressed the bounds of reverent respect.The old man will apply
all this to the Duchess, as they call her, of Rothsay.Dwining, thou
shouldst be a secretis to his Holiness the Pope, who sometimes, it is
said, wants a scribe that can make one word record two meanings.I will
subscribe it, and have the praise of the device.""And now, my lord," said Ramorny, sealing the letter and leaving it
behind, "will you not to boat?""Not till my chamberlain attends with some clothes and necessaries, and
you may call my sewer also.""My lord," said Ramorny, "time presses, and preparation will but excite
suspicion.Your officers will follow with the mails tomorrow.For
tonight, I trust my poor service may suffice to wait on you at table and
chamber.""Nay, this time it is thou who forgets," said the Prince, touching the
wounded arm with his walking rod."Recollect, man, thou canst neither
carve a capon nor tie a point--a goodly sewer or valet of the mouth!"Ramorny grinned with rage and pain; for his wound, though in a way of
healing, was still highly sensitive, and even the pointing a finger
towards it made him tremble."Will your Highness now be pleased to take boat?""Not till I take leave of the Lord Constable.Rothsay must not slip
away, like a thief from a prison, from the house of Errol."My Lord Duke," said Ramorny, "it may be dangerous to our plan.""To the devil with danger, thy plan, and thyself!I must and will act to
Errol as becomes us both."The earl entered, agreeable to the Prince's summons."I gave you this trouble, my lord," said Rothsay, with the dignified
courtesy which he knew so well how to assume, "to thank you for your
hospitality and your good company.I can enjoy them no longer, as
pressing affairs call me to Falkland.""My lord," said the Lord High Constable, "I trust your Grace remembers
that you are--under ward."If I am a prisoner, speak plainly; if not, I will
take my freedom to depart.""I would, my lord, your Highness would request his Majesty's permission
for this journey."Mean you displeasure against yourself, my lord, or against me?""I have already said your Highness lies in ward here; but if you
determine to break it, I have no warrant--God forbid--to put force on
your inclinations.I can but entreat your Highness, for your own sake--"

"Of my own interest I am the best judge.The wilful Prince stepped into the boat with Dwining and Ramorny, and,
waiting for no other attendance, Eviot pushed off the vessel, which
descended the Tay rapidly by the assistance of sail and oar and of the
ebb tide.For some space the Duke of Rothsay appeared silent and moody, nor did
his companions interrupt his reflections.He raised his head at length
and said: "My father loves a jest, and when all is over he will take
this frolic at no more serious rate than it deserves--a fit of youth,
with which he will deal as he has with others.Yonder, my masters, shows
the old hold of Kinfauns, frowning above the Tay.Now, tell me, John
Ramorny, how thou hast dealt to get the Fair Maid of Perth out of the
hands of yonder bull headed provost; for Errol told me it was rumoured
that she was under his protection.""Truly she was, my lord, with the purpose of being transferred to the
patronage of the Duchess--I mean of the Lady Marjory of Douglas.Now,
this beetle headed provost, who is after all but a piece of blundering
valiancy, has, like most such, a retainer of some slyness and cunning,
whom he uses in all his dealings, and whose suggestions he generally
considers as his own ideas.Whenever I would possess myself of a
landward baron, I address myself to such a confidant, who, in the
present case, is called Kitt Henshaw, an old skipper upon the Tay,
and who, having in his time sailed as far as Campvere, holds with Sir
Patrick Charteris the respect due to one who has seen foreign countries.This his agent I have made my own, and by his means have insinuated
various apologies in order to postpone the departure of Catharine for
Falkland.""I know not if it is wise to tell your Highness, lest you should
disapprove of my views.I meant the officers of the Commission for
inquiry into heretical opinions should have found the Fair Maid at
Kinfauns, for our beauty is a peevish, self willed swerver from the
church; and certes, I designed that the knight should have come in
for his share of the fines and confiscations that were about to be
inflicted.The monks were eager enough to be at him, seeing he hath had
frequent disputes with them about the salmon tithe.""But wherefore wouldst thou have ruined the knight's fortunes, and
brought the beautiful young woman to the stake, perchance?"An old woman
might have been in some danger; and as for my Lord Provost, as they call
him, if they had clipped off some of his fat acres, it would have
been some atonement for the needless brave he put on me in St."Methinks, John, it was but a base revenge," said Rothsay.He that cannot right himself by the hand
must use his head.Well, that chance was over by the tender hearted
Douglas's declaring in favour of tender conscience; and then, my lord,
old Henshaw found no further objections to carrying the Fair Maid
of Perth to Falkland, not to share the dulness of the Lady Marjory's
society, as Sir Patrick Charteris and she herself doth opine, but to
keep your Highness from tiring when we return from hunting in the park."There was again a long pause, in which the Prince seemed to muse deeply."Ramorny, I have a scruple in this matter; but if I
name it to thee, the devil of sophistry, with which thou art possessed,
will argue it out of me, as it has done many others.This girl is the
most beautiful, one excepted, whom I ever saw or knew; and I like her
the more that she bears some features of--Elizabeth of Dunbar.But she,
I mean Catharine Glover, is contracted, and presently to be wedded, to
Henry the armourer, a craftsman unequalled for skill, and a man at arms
yet unmatched in the barrace.To follow out this intrigue would do a
good fellow too much wrong.""Your Highness will not expect me to be very solicitous of Henry Smith's
interest," said Ramorny, looking at his wounded arm.Andrew with his shored cross, this disaster of thine is too much
harped upon, John Ramorny!Others are content with putting a finger
into every man's pie, but thou must thrust in thy whole gory hand.It is
done, and cannot be undone; let it be forgotten.""Nay, my lord, you allude to it more frequently than I," answered the
knight--"in derision, it is true; while I--but I can be silent on the
subject if I cannot forget it.""Well, then, I tell thee that I have scruple about this intrigue.Dost
thou remember, when we went in a frolic to hear Father Clement preach,
or rather to see this fair heretic, that he spoke as touchingly as a
minstrel about the rich man taking away the poor man's only ewe lamb?""A great matter, indeed," answered Sir John, "that this churl's wife's
eldest son should be fathered by the Prince of Scotland!How many earls
would covet the like fate for their fair countesses?and how many that
have had such good luck sleep not a grain the worse for it?""And if I might presume to speak," said the mediciner, "the ancient
laws of Scotland assigned such a privilege to every feudal lord over his
female vassals, though lack of spirit and love of money hath made many
exchange it for gold.""I require no argument to urge me to be kind to a pretty woman; but this
Catharine has been ever cold to me," said the Prince."Nay, my lord," said Ramorny, "if, young, handsome, and a prince, you
know not how to make yourself acceptable to a fine woman, it is not for
me to say more.""And if it were not far too great audacity in me to speak again, I would
say," quoth the leech, "that all Perth knows that the Gow Chrom never
was the maiden's choice, but fairly forced upon her by her father.I
know for certain that she refused him repeatedly.""Nay, if thou canst assure us of that, the case is much altered," said
Rothsay."Vulcan was a smith as well as Harry Wynd; he would needs wed
Venus, and our chronicles tell us what came of it.""Then long may Lady Venus live and be worshipped," said Sir John
Ramorny, "and success to the gallant knight Mars who goes a-wooing to
her goddess-ship!"The discourse took a gay and idle turn for a few minutes; but the Duke
of Rothsay soon dropped it."I have left," he said, "yonder air of the
prison house behind me, and yet my spirits scarce revive.I feel that
drowsy, not unpleasing, yet melancholy mood that comes over us when
exhausted by exercise or satiated with pleasure.Some music now,
stealing on the ear, yet not loud enough to make us lift the eye, were a
treat for the gods.""Your Grace has but to speak your wishes, and the nymphs of the Tay are
as favourable as the fair ones upon the shore.said the Duke of Rothsay, listening; "it is, and rarely
touched.Steer towards the boat from
whence the music comes.""It is old Henshaw," said Ramorny, "working up the stream.The boatman answered the hail, and drew up alongside of the Prince's
barge.said the Prince, recognising the figure as well
as the appointments of the French glee woman, Louise."I think I owe
thee something for being the means of thy having a fright, at least,
upon St.Into this boat with thee, lute, puppy dog,
scrip and all; I will prefer thee to a lady's service who shall feed thy
very cur on capons and canary.""I trust your Highness will consider--" said Ramorny."I will consider nothing but my pleasure, John.Pray, do thou be so
complying as to consider it also.""Is it indeed to a lady's service you would promote me?""Oh, I have heard of that great lady!"said Louise; "and will you indeed
prefer me to your right royal consort's service?""I will, by my honour--whenever I receive her as such.Mark that
reservation, John," said he aside to Ramorny.The persons who were in the boat caught up the tidings, and, concluding
a reconciliation was about to take place betwixt the royal couple,
exhorted Louise to profit by her good fortune, and add herself to the
Duchess of Rothsay's train.Several offered her some acknowledgment for
the exercise of her talents.During this moment of delay, Ramorny whispered to Dwining: "Make in,
knave, with some objection.Rouse thy
wits, while I speak a word with Henshaw.""If I might presume to speak," said Dwining, "as one who have made
my studies both in Spain and Arabia, I would say, my lord, that the
sickness has appeared in Edinburgh, and that there may be risk in
admitting this young wanderer into your Highness's vicinity."and what is it to thee," said Rothsay, "whether I choose to be
poisoned by the pestilence or the 'pothecary?Must thou, too, needs
thwart my humour?"While the Prince thus silenced the remonstrances of Dwining, Sir John
Ramorny had snatched a moment to learn from Henshaw that the removal of
the Duchess of Rothsay from Falkland was still kept profoundly secret,
and that Catharine Glover would arrive there that evening or the
next morning, in expectation of being taken under the noble lady's
protection.The Duke of Rothsay, deeply plunged in thought, received this intimation
so coldly, that Ramorny took the liberty of remonstrating."This, my
lord," he said, "is playing the spoiled child of fortune.You wish for
liberty; it comes.You wish for beauty; it awaits you, with just so much
delay as to render the boon more precious.Even your slightest desires
seem a law to the Fates; for you desire music when it seems most
distant, and the lute and song are at your hand.These things, so sent,
should be enjoyed, else we are but like petted children, who break and
throw from them the toys they have wept themselves sick for.""To enjoy pleasure, Ramorny," said the Prince, "a man should have
suffered pain, as it requires fasting to gain a good appetite.We, who
can have all for a wish, little enjoy that all when we have possessed
it.Seest thou yonder thick cloud, which is about to burst to rain?It
seems to stifle me--the waters look dark and lurid--the shores have lost
their beautiful form--"

"My lord, forgive your servant," said Ramorny."You indulge a powerful
imagination, as an unskilful horseman permits a fiery steed to rear
until he falls back on his master and crushes him.I pray you shake off
this lethargy.Shall the glee maiden make some music?""Let her; but it must be melancholy: all mirth would at this moment jar
on my ear."The maiden sung a melancholy dirge in Norman French; the words, of which
the following is an imitation, were united to a tune as doleful as they
are themselves:

     Yes, thou mayst sigh,
     And look once more at all around,
     At stream and bank, and sky and ground.Thy life its final course has found,
     And thou must die.Yes, lay thee down,
     And while thy struggling pulses flutter,
     Bid the grey monk his soul mass mutter,
     And the deep bell its death tone utter--
     Thy life is gone.'Tis but a pang, and then a thrill,
     A fever fit, and then a chill,
     And then an end of human ill,
     For thou art dead.The Prince made no observation on the music; and the maiden, at
Ramorny's beck, went on from time to time with her minstrel craft, until
the evening sunk down into rain, first soft and gentle, at length in
great quantities, and accompanied by a cold wind.There was neither
cloak nor covering for the Prince, and he sullenly rejected that which
Ramorny offered."It is not for Rothsay to wear your cast garments, Sir John; this melted
snow, which I feel pierce me to the very marrow, I am now encountering
by your fault.Why did you presume to put off the boat without my
servants and apparel?"Ramorny did not attempt an exculpation; for he knew the Prince was in
one of those humours, when to enlarge upon a grievance was more pleasing
to him than to have his mouth stopped by any reasonable apology.In
sullen silence, or amid unsuppressed chiding, the boat arrived at the
fishing village of Newburgh.The party landed, and found horses in
readiness, which, indeed, Ramorny had long since provided for the
occasion.Their quality underwent the Prince's bitter sarcasm, expressed
to Ramorny sometimes by direct words, oftener by bitter gibes.At length
they were mounted and rode on through the closing night and the falling
rain, the Prince leading the way with reckless haste.The glee maiden,
mounted by his express order, attended them and well for her that,
accustomed to severe weather, and exercise both on foot and horseback,
she supported as firmly as the men the fatigues of the nocturnal ride.Ramorny was compelled to keep at the Prince's rein, being under no small
anxiety lest, in his wayward fit, he might ride off from him entirely,
and, taking refuge in the house of some loyal baron, escape the snare
which was spread for him.He therefore suffered inexpressibly during the
ride, both in mind and in body.At length the forest of Falkland received them, and a glimpse of the
moon showed the dark and huge tower, an appendage of royalty itself,
though granted for a season to the Duke of Albany.On a signal given the
drawbridge fell.Torches glared in the courtyard, menials attended,
and the Prince, assisted from horseback, was ushered into an apartment,
where Ramorny waited on him, together with Dwining, and entreated him
to take the leech's advice.The Duke of Rothsay repulsed the proposal,
haughtily ordered his bed to be prepared, and having stood for some time
shivering in his dank garments beside a large blazing fire, he retired
to his apartment without taking leave of anyone."You see the peevish humour of this childish boy, now," said Ramorny to
Dwining; "can you wonder that a servant who has done so much for him as
I have should be tired of such a master?""No, truly," said Dwining, "that and the promised earldom of Lindores
would shake any man's fidelity.But shall we commence with him this
evening?He has, if eye and cheek speak true, the foundation of a fever
within him, which will make our work easy while it will seem the effect
of nature.""It is an opportunity lost," said Ramorny; "but we must delay our blow
till he has seen this beauty, Catharine Glover.She may be hereafter a
witness that she saw him in good health, and master of his own motions,
a brief space before--you understand me?"Dwining nodded assent, and added:

"There is no time lost; for there is little difficulty in blighting a
flower exhausted from having been made to bloom too soon."in sooth he was a shameless wight,
     Sore given to revel and ungodly glee:
     Few earthly things found favour in his sight,
     Save concubines and carnal companie,
     And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.With the next morning the humour of the Duke of Rothsay was changed.He complained, indeed, of pain and fever, but they rather seemed to
stimulate than to overwhelm him.He was familiar with Ramorny, and
though he said nothing on the subject of the preceding night, it was
plain he remembered what he desired to obliterate from the memory of his
followers--the ill humour he had then displayed.He was civil to every
one, and jested with Ramorny on the subject of Catharine's arrival."How surprised will the pretty prude be at seeing herself in a family
of men, when she expects to be admitted amongst the hoods and pinners
of Dame Marjory's waiting women!Thou hast not many of the tender sex in
thy household, I take it, Ramorny?""Faith, none except the minstrel wench, but a household drudge or two
whom we may not dispense with.By the way, she is anxiously inquiring
after the mistress your Highness promised to prefer her to.Shall I
dismiss her, to hunt for her new mistress at leisure?""By no means, she will serve to amuse Catharine.And, hark you, were it
not well to receive that coy jillet with something of a mumming?"We will not disappoint her, since she expects
to find the Duchess of Rothsay: I will be Duke and Duchess in my own
person.""No one so dull as a wit," said the Prince, "when he does not hit off
the scent at once.My Duchess, as they call her, has been in as great a
hurry to run away from Falkland as I to come hither.There is as much female trumpery in the wardrobe
adjoining to my sleeping room as would equip a whole carnival.Look you,
I will play Dame Marjory, disposed on this day bed here with a mourning
veil and a wreath of willow, to show my forsaken plight; thou, John,
wilt look starch and stiff enough for her Galwegian maid of honour,
the Countess Hermigild; and Dwining shall present the old Hecate, her
nurse--only she hath more beard on her upper lip than Dwining on his
whole face, and skull to boot.He should have the commodity of a beard
to set her forth conformably.Get thy kitchen drudges, and what passable
pages thou hast with thee, to make my women of the bedroom.Ramorny hasted into the anteroom, and told Dwining the Prince's device."Do thou look to humour the fool," he said; "I care not how little I see
him, knowing what is to be done.""Trust all to me," said the physician, shrugging his shoulders."What
sort of a butcher is he that can cut the lamb's throat, yet is afraid to
hear it bleat?""Tush, fear not my constancy: I cannot forget that he would have cast
me into the cloister with as little regard as if he threw away the
truncheon of a broken lance.Begone--yet stay; ere you go to arrange
this silly pageant, something must be settled to impose on the thick
witted Charteris.He is like enough, should he be left in the belief
that the Duchess of Rothsay is still here, and Catharine Glover in
attendance on her, to come down with offers of service, and the like,
when, as I need scarce tell thee, his presence would be inconvenient.Indeed, this is the more likely, that some folks have given a warmer
name to the iron headed knight's great and tender patronage of this
damsel.""With that hint, let me alone to deal with him.I will send him such a
letter, that for this month he shall hold himself as ready for a journey
to hell as to Falkland.Can you tell me the name of the Duchess's
confessor?""Waltheof, a grey friar."In a few minutes, for he was a clerk of rare celerity, Dwining finished
a letter, which he placed in Ramorny's hand."This is admirable, and would have made thy fortune with Rothsay.I
think I should have been too jealous to trust thee in his household,
save that his day is closed.""Read it aloud," said Dwining, "that we may judge if it goes trippingly
off."And Ramorny read as follows: "By command of our high and mighty Princess
Marjory, Duchess of Rothsay, and so forth, we Waltheof, unworthy brother
of the order of St.Francis, do thee, Sir Patrick Charteris, knight of
Kinfauns, to know, that her Highness marvels much at the temerity with
which you have sent to her presence a woman of whose fame she can judge
but lightly, seeing she hath made her abode, without any necessity,
for more than a week in thine own castle, without company of any other
female, saving menials; of which foul cohabitation the savour is gone
up through Fife, Angus, and Perthshire.Nevertheless, her Highness,
considering the ease as one of human frailty, hath not caused this
wanton one to be scourged with nettles, or otherwise to dree penance;
but, as two good brethren of the convent of Lindores, the Fathers
Thickskull and Dundermore, have been summoned up to the Highlands upon
an especial call, her Highness hath committed to their care this maiden
Catharine, with charge to convey her to her father, whom she states
to be residing beside Loch Tay, under whose protection she will find
a situation more fitting her qualities and habits than the Castle of
Falkland, while her Highness the Duchess of Rothsay abides there.She
hath charged the said reverend brothers so to deal with the young woman
as may give her a sense of the sin of incontinence, and she commendeth
thee to confession and penitence.--Signed, Waltheof, by command of an
high and mighty Princess"; and so forth.When he had finished, "Excellent--excellent!""This
unexpected rebuff will drive Charteris mad!He hath been long making
a sort of homage to this lady, and to find himself suspected of
incontinence, when he was expecting the full credit of a charitable
action, will altogether confound him; and, as thou say'st, it will be
long enough ere he come hither to look after the damsel or do honour
to the dame.But away to thy pageant, while I prepare that which shall
close the pageant for ever."It was an hour before noon, when Catharine, escorted by old Henshaw and
a groom of the Knight of Kinfauns, arrived before the lordly tower of
Falkland.The broad banner which was displayed from it bore the arms
of Rothsay, the servants who appeared wore the colours of the Prince's
household, all confirming the general belief that the Duchess still
resided there.Catharine's heart throbbed, for she had heard that
the Duchess had the pride as well as the high courage of the house
of Douglas, and felt uncertain touching the reception she was to
experience.On entering the castle, she observed that the train was
smaller than she had expected, but, as the Duchess lived in close
retirement, she was little surprised at this.In a species of anteroom
she was met by a little old woman, who seemed bent double with age, and
supported herself upon an ebony staff."Truly thou art welcome, fair daughter," said she, saluting Catharine,
"and, as I may say, to an afflicted house; and I trust (once more
saluting her) thou wilt be a consolation to my precious and right royal
daughter the Duchess.Sit thee down, my child, till I see whether my
lady be at leisure to receive thee.Ah, my child, thou art very lovely
indeed, if Our Lady hath given to thee a soul to match with so fair a
body."With that the counterfeit old woman crept into the next apartment,
where she found Rothsay in the masquerading habit he had prepared, and
Ramorny, who had evaded taking part in the pageant, in his ordinary
attire."Thou art a precious rascal, sir doctor," said the Prince; "by my
honour, I think thou couldst find in thy heart to play out the whole
play thyself, lover's part and all.""If it were to save your Highness trouble," said the leech, with his
usual subdued laugh."No--no," said Rothsay, "I never need thy help, man; and tell me now,
how look I, thus disposed on the couch--languishing and ladylike, ha?""Something too fine complexioned and soft featured for the Lady Marjory
of Douglas, if I may presume to say so," said the leech."Away, villain, and marshal in this fair frost piece--fear not she will
complain of my effeminacy; and thou, Ramorny, away also."As the knight left the apartment by one door, the fictitious old woman
ushered in Catharine Glover by another.The room had been carefully
darkened to twilight, so that Catharine saw the apparently female figure
stretched on the couch without the least suspicion.asked Rothsay, in a voice naturally sweet, and now
carefully modulated to a whispering tone."Let her approach, Griselda,
and kiss our hand."The supposed nurse led the trembling maiden forward to the side of the
couch, and signed to her to kneel.Catharine did so, and kissed with
much devotion and simplicity the gloved hand which the counterfeit
duchess extended to her."Be not afraid," said the same musical voice; "in me you only see a
melancholy example of the vanity of human greatness; happy those, my
child, whose rank places them beneath the storms of state."While he spoke, he put his arms around her neck and drew her towards
him, as if to salute her in token of welcome.But the kiss was bestowed
with an earnestness which so much overacted the part of the fair
patroness, that Catharine, concluding the Duchess had lost her senses,
screamed aloud.Catharine looked around her; the nurse was gone, and the Duke tearing
off his veil, she saw herself in the power of a daring young libertine.she said; "and Thou wilt, if I forsake
not myself."As this resolution darted through her mind, she repressed her
disposition to scream, and, as far as she might, strove to conceal her
fear."The jest hath been played," she said, with as much firmness as she
could assume; "may I entreat that your Highness will now unhand me?"for
he still kept hold of her arm."Nay, my pretty captive, struggle not--why should you fear?"As you are pleased to detain me, I will
not, by striving, provoke you to use me ill, and give pain to yourself,
when you have time to think.""Why, thou traitress, thou hast held me captive for months," said the
Prince, "and wilt thou not let me hold thee for a moment?""This were gallantry, my lord, were it in the streets of Perth, where I
might listen or escape as I listed; it is tyranny here.""And if I did let thee go, whither wouldst thou fly?""The bridges are up, the portcullis down, and the men who follow me are
strangely deaf to a peevish maiden's squalls.Be kind, therefore, and
you shall know what it is to oblige a prince.""Unloose me, then, my lord, and hear me appeal from thyself to thyself,
from Rothsay to the Prince of Scotland.I am the daughter of an humble
but honest citizen.I am, I may well nigh say, the spouse of a brave and
honest man.If I have given your Highness any encouragement for what you
have done, it has been unintentional.Thus forewarned, I entreat you to
forego your power over me, and suffer me to depart.Your Highness can
obtain nothing from me, save by means equally unworthy of knighthood or
manhood.""You are bold, Catharine," said the Prince, "but neither as a knight
nor a man can I avoid accepting a defiance.I must teach you the risk of
such challenges."While he spoke, he attempted to throw his arms again around her; but she
eluded his grasp, and proceeded in the same tone of firm decision."My strength, my lord, is as great to defend myself in an honourable
strife as yours can be to assail me with a most dishonourable purpose.Do not shame yourself and me by putting it to the combat.You may stun
me with blows, or you may call aid to overpower me; but otherwise you
will fail of your purpose.""The force I would
use is no more than excuses women in yielding to their own weakness.""Then keep it," said Catharine, "for those women who desire such an
excuse.My resistance is that of the most determined mind which love
of honour and fear of shame ever inspired.my lord, could you
succeed, you would but break every bond between me and life, between
yourself and honour.I have been trained fraudulently here, by what
decoys I know not; but were I to go dishonoured hence, it would be to
denounce the destroyer of my happiness to every quarter of Europe.I would take the palmer's staff in my hand, and wherever chivalry is
honoured, or the word Scotland has been heard, I would proclaim the heir
of a hundred kings, the son of the godly Robert Stuart, the heir of
the heroic Bruce, a truthless, faithless man, unworthy of the crown he
expects and of the spurs he wears.Every lady in wide Europe would hold
your name too foul for her lips; every worthy knight would hold you
a baffled, forsworn caitiff, false to the first vow of arms, the
protection of woman and the defence of the feeble."Rothsay resumed his seat, and looked at her with a countenance in which
resentment was mingled with admiration."You forget to whom you speak,
maiden.Know, the distinction I have offered you is one for which
hundreds whose trains you are born to bear would feel gratitude.""Once more, my lord," resumed Catharine, "keep these favours for those
by whom they are prized; or rather reserve your time and your health
for other and nobler pursuits--for the defence of your country and
the happiness of your subjects.Alas, my lord, how willingly would an
exulting people receive you for their chief!How gladly would they close
around you, did you show desire to head them against the oppression of
the mighty, the violence of the lawless, the seduction of the vicious,
and the tyranny of the hypocrite!"The Duke of Rothsay, whose virtuous feelings were as easily excited
as they were evanescent, was affected by the enthusiasm with which she
spoke."Forgive me if I have alarmed you, maiden," he said "thou art
too noble minded to be the toy of passing pleasure, for which my mistake
destined thee; and I, even were thy birth worthy of thy noble spirit and
transcendent beauty, have no heart to give thee; for by the homage of
the heart only should such as thou be wooed.But my hopes have been
blighted, Catharine: the only woman I ever loved has been torn from me
in the very wantonness of policy, and a wife imposed on me whom I must
ever detest, even had she the loveliness and softness which alone can
render a woman amiable in my eyes.My health is fading even in early
youth; and all that is left for me is to snatch such flowers as the
short passage from life to the grave will now present.Look at my hectic
cheek; feel, if you will, my intermitting pulse; and pity me and excuse
me if I, whose rights as a prince and as a man have been trampled upon
and usurped, feel occasional indifference towards the rights of others,
and indulge a selfish desire to gratify the wish of the passing moment."exclaimed Catharine, with the enthusiasm which belonged
to her character--"I will call you my dear lord, for dear must the heir
of Bruce be to every child of Scotland--let me not, I pray, hear you
speak thus!Your glorious ancestor endured exile, persecution, the night
of famine, and the day of unequal combat, to free his country; do you
practise the like self denial to free yourself.Tear yourself from those
who find their own way to greatness smoothed by feeding your follies.You know it not, I am sure--you could not
know; but the wretch who could urge the daughter to courses of shame by
threatening the life of the aged father is capable of all that is vile,
all that is treacherous!""He did indeed, my lord, and he dares not deny it.""It shall be looked to," answered the Duke of Rothsay."I have ceased
to love him; but he has suffered much for my sake, and I must see his
services honourably requited."Oh, my lord, if chronicles speak true, such services
brought Troy to ruins and gave the infidels possession of Spain.""Hush, maiden--speak within compass, I pray you," said the Prince,
rising up; "our conference ends here.""Yet one word, my Lord Duke of Rothsay," said Catharine, with animation,
while her beautiful countenance resembled that of an admonitory angel."I cannot tell what impels me to speak thus boldly; but the fire burns
within me, and will break out.Leave this castle without an hour's
delay; the air is unwholesome for you.Dismiss this Ramorny before the
day is ten minutes older; his company is most dangerous.""None in especial," answered Catharine, abashed at her own
eagerness--"none, perhaps, excepting my fears for your safety.""To vague fears the heir of Bruce must not listen.Ramorny entered, and bowed low to the Duke and to the maiden, whom,
perhaps, he considered as likely to be preferred to the post of
favourite sultana, and therefore entitled to a courteous obeisance."Ramorny," said the Prince, "is there in the household any female of
reputation who is fit to wait on this young woman till we can send her
where she may desire to go?""I fear," replied Ramorny, "if it displease not your Highness to hear
the truth, your household is indifferently provided in that way; and
that, to speak the very verity, the glee maiden is the most decorous
amongst us.""Let her wait upon this young person, then, since better may not be.And
take patience, maiden, for a few hours.""So, my lord, part you so soon from the Fair Maid of Perth?This is,
indeed, the very wantonness of victory.""There is neither victory nor defeat in the case," returned the Prince,
drily."The girl loves me not; nor do I love her well enough to torment
myself concerning her scruples.""The chaste Malcolm the Maiden revived in one of his descendants!""Favour me, sir, by a truce to your wit, or by choosing a different
subject for its career.It is noon, I believe, and you will oblige me by
commanding them to serve up dinner."Ramorny left the room; but Rothsay thought he discovered a smile upon
his countenance, and to be the subject of this man's satire gave him no
ordinary degree of pain.He summoned, however, the knight to his table,
and even admitted Dwining to the same honour.The conversation was of
a lively and dissolute cast, a tone encouraged by the Prince, as if
designing to counterbalance the gravity of his morals in the morning,
which Ramorny, who was read in old chronicles, had the boldness to liken
to the continence of Scipio.The banquet, nothwithstanding the Duke's indifferent health, was
protracted in idle wantonness far beyond the rules of temperance; and,
whether owing simply to the strength of the wine which he drank, or the
weakness of his constitution, or, as it is probable, because the last
wine which he quaffed had been adulterated by Dwining, it so happened
that the Prince, towards the end of the repast, fell into a lethargic
sleep, from which it seemed impossible to rouse him.Sir John Ramorny
and Dwining carried him to his chamber, accepting no other assistance
than that of another person, whom we will afterwards give name to.Next morning, it was announced that the Prince was taken ill of
an infectious disorder; and, to prevent its spreading through the
household, no one was admitted to wait on him save his late master of
horse, the physician Dwining, and the domestic already mentioned; one of
whom seemed always to remain in the apartment, while the others observed
a degree of precaution respecting their intercourse with the rest of the
family, so strict as to maintain the belief that he was dangerously ill
of an infectious disorder.In winter's tedious nights, sit by the fire,
     With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales
     Of woeful ages, long ago betid:
     And, ere thou bid goodnight, to quit their grief,
     Tell thou the lamentable fall of me.King Richard II Act V. Scene I.


Far different had been the fate of the misguided heir of Scotland from
that which was publicly given out in the town of Falkland.His ambitious
uncle had determined on his death, as the means of removing the first
and most formidable barrier betwixt his own family and the throne.James, the younger son of the King, was a mere boy, who might at more
leisure be easily set aside.Ramorny's views of aggrandisement, and the
resentment which he had latterly entertained against his masters made
him a willing agent in young Rothsay's destruction.Dwining's love of
gold, and his native malignity of disposition, rendered him equally
forward.It had been resolved, with the most calculating cruelty,
that all means which might leave behind marks of violence were to be
carefully avoided, and the extinction of life suffered to take place
of itself by privation of every kind acting upon a frail and impaired
constitution.The Prince of Scotland was not to be murdered, as Ramorny
had expressed himself on another occasion, he was only to cease to
exist.Rothsay's bedchamber in the Tower of Falkland was well adapted
for the execution of such a horrible project.A small, narrow staircase,
scarce known to exist, opened from thence by a trapdoor to the
subterranean dungeons of the castle, through a passage by which
the feudal lord was wont to visit, in private and in disguise, the
inhabitants of those miserable regions.By this staircase the villains
conveyed the insensible Prince to the lowest dungeon of the castle,
so deep in the bowels of the earth, that no cries or groans, it was
supposed, could possibly be heard, while the strength of its door and
fastenings must for a long time have defied force, even if the entrance
could have been discovered.Bonthron, who had been saved from the
gallows for the purpose, was the willing agent of Ramorny's unparalleled
cruelty to his misled and betrayed patron.This wretch revisited the dungeon at the time when the Prince's lethargy
began to wear off, and when, awaking to sensation, he felt himself
deadly cold, unable to move, and oppressed with fetters, which scarce
permitted him to stir from the dank straw on which he was laid.His
first idea was that he was in a fearful dream, his next brought a
confused augury of the truth.He called, shouted, yelled at length in
frenzy but no assistance came, and he was only answered by the vaulted
roof of the dungeon.The agent of hell heard these agonizing screams,
and deliberately reckoned them against the taunts and reproaches with
which Rothsay had expressed his instinctive aversion to him.When,
exhausted and hopeless, the unhappy youth remained silent, the savage
resolved to present himself before the eyes of his prisoner.The locks
were drawn, the chain fell; the Prince raised himself as high as his
fetters permitted; a red glare, against which he was fain to shut his
eyes, streamed through the vault; and when he opened them again, it was
on the ghastly form of one whom he had reason to think dead."I am judged and condemned," he exclaimed, "and the most abhorred fiend
in the infernal regions is sent to torment me!""I live, my lord," said Bonthron; "and that you may live and enjoy life,
be pleased to sit up and eat your victuals.""Free me from these irons," said the Prince, "release me from this
dungeon, and, dog as thou art, thou shalt be the richest man in
Scotland.""If you would give me the weight of your shackles in gold," said
Bonthron, "I would rather see the iron on you than have the treasure
myself!But look up; you were wont to love delicate fare--behold how I
have catered for you."The wretch, with fiendish glee, unfolded a piece of rawhide covering the
bundle which he bore under' his arm, and, passing the light to and fro
before it, showed the unhappy Prince a bull's head recently hewn from
the trunk, and known in Scotland as the certain signal of death.He
placed it at the foot of the bed, or rather lair, on which the Prince
lay."Be moderate in your food," he said; "it is like to be long ere thou
getst another meal.""Tell me but one thing, wretch," said the Prince."Does Ramorny know of
this practice?""How else hadst thou been decoyed hither?Poor woodcock, thou art
snared!"With these words, the door shut, the bolts resounded, and the unhappy
Prince was left to darkness, solitude, and misery."Oh, my father!--my
prophetic father!The staff I leaned on has indeed proved a spear!"We will not dwell on the subsequent hours, nay, days, of bodily agony
and mental despair.But it was not the pleasure of Heaven that so great a crime should be
perpetrated with impunity.Catharine Glover and the glee woman, neglected by the other inmates,
who seemed to be engaged with the tidings of the Prince's illness, were,
however, refused permission to leave the castle until it should be seen
how this alarming disease was to terminate, and whether it was actually
an infectious sickness.Forced on each other's society, the two desolate
women became companions, if not friends; and the union drew somewhat
closer when Catharine discovered that this was the same female minstrel
on whose account Henry Wynd had fallen under her displeasure.She now
heard his complete vindication, and listened with ardour to the praises
which Louise heaped on her gallant protector.On the other hand, the
minstrel, who felt the superiority of Catharine's station and character,
willingly dwelt upon a theme which seemed to please her, and recorded
her gratitude to the stout smith in the little song of "Bold and True,"
which was long a favourite in Scotland.Oh, bold and true,
     In bonnet blue,
     That fear or falsehood never knew,
     Whose heart was loyal to his word,
     Whose hand was faithful to his sword--
     Seek Europe wide from sea to sea,
     But bonny blue cap still for me!I've seen Almain's proud champions prance,
     Have seen the gallant knights of France,
     Unrivall'd with the sword and lance,
     Have seen the sons of England true,
     Wield the brown bill and bend the yew.Search France the fair, and England free,
     But bonny blue cap still for me!In short, though Louise's disreputable occupation would have been in
other circumstances an objection to Catharine's voluntarily frequenting
her company, yet, forced together as they now were, she found her a
humble and accommodating companion.They lived in this manner for four or five days, and, in order to avoid
as much as possible the gaze, and perhaps the incivility, of the menials
in the offices, they prepared their food in their own apartment.In the
absolutely necessary intercourse with domestics, Louise, more accustomed
to expedients, bolder by habit, and desirous to please Catharine,
willingly took on herself the trouble of getting from the pantler the
materials of their slender meal, and of arranging it with the dexterity
of her country.The glee woman had been abroad for this purpose upon the sixth day, a
little before noon; and the desire of fresh air, or the hope to find
some sallad or pot herbs, or at least an early flower or two, with which
to deck their board, had carried her into the small garden appertaining
to the castle.She re-entered her apartment in the tower with a
countenance pale as ashes, and a frame which trembled like an aspen
leaf.Her terror instantly extended itself to Catharine, who could
hardly find words to ask what new misfortune had occurred.said Louise, speaking under her breath, and huddling
her words so thick upon each other that Catharine could hardly catch
the sense."I was seeking for flowers to dress your pottage, because
you said you loved them yesterday; my poor little dog, thrusting himself
into a thicket of yew and holly bushes that grow out of some old ruins
close to the castle wall, came back whining and howling.I crept forward
to see what might be the cause--and, oh!I heard a groaning as of one
in extreme pain, but so faint, that it seemed to arise out of the very
depth of the earth.At length, I found it proceeded from a small rent in
the wall, covered with ivy; and when I laid my ear close to the opening,
I could hear the Prince's voice distinctly say, 'It cannot now last
long'--and then it sunk away in something like a prayer.""I said, 'Is it you, my lord?'and the answer was, 'Who mocks me with
that title?'I asked him if I could help him, and he answered with a
voice I shall never forget, 'Food--food!So I came
hither to tell you.that were more likely to destroy than to aid," said Catharine."I know not yet," said Catharine, prompt and bold on occasions of
moment, though yielding to her companion in ingenuity of resource on
ordinary occasions: "I know not yet, but something we will do: the blood
of Bruce shall not die unaided."So saying, she seized the small cruise which contained their soup, and
the meat of which it was made, wrapped some thin cakes which she had
baked into the fold of her plaid, and, beckoning her companion to follow
with a vessel of milk, also part of their provisions, she hastened
towards the garden."So, our fair vestal is stirring abroad?"said the only man she met, who
was one of the menials; but Catharine passed on without notice or reply,
and gained the little garden without farther interruption.Louise indicated to her a heap of ruins, which, covered with underwood,
was close to the castle wall.It had probably been originally a
projection from the building; and the small fissure, which communicated
with the dungeon, contrived for air, had terminated within it.Mary travelled to the bathroom.But the
aperture had been a little enlarged by decay, and admitted a dim ray of
light to its recesses, although it could not be observed by those who
visited the place with torchlight aids."Here is dead silence," said Catharine, after she had listened
attentively for a moment."Heaven and earth, he is gone!""We must risk something," said her companion, and ran her fingers over
the strings of her guitar.A sigh was the only answer from the depth of the dungeon."I am here, my lord--I am here, with food and drink."The jest comes too late; I am dying," was the answer."His brain is turned, and no wonder," thought Catharine; "but whilst
there is life, there may be hope.""It is I, my lord, Catharine Glover.I have food, if I could pass it
safely to you."I thought the pain was over, but it glows
again within me at the name of food.""The food is here, but how--ah, how can I pass it to you?the chink
is so narrow, the wall is so thick!Yet there is a remedy--I have it.Quick, Louise; cut me a willow bough, the tallest you can find."The glee maiden obeyed, and, by means of a cleft in the top of the
wand, Catharine transmitted several morsels of the soft cakes, soaked in
broth, which served at once for food and for drink.The unfortunate young man ate little, and with difficulty, but prayed
for a thousand blessings on the head of his comforter."I had destined
thee to be the slave of my vices," he said, "and yet thou triest to
become the preserver of my life!"I will return with food as I shall see opportunity," said Catharine,
just as the glee maiden plucked her sleeve and desired her to be silent
and stand close.Both crouched among the ruins, and they heard the voices of Ramorny and
the mediciner in close conversation."He is stronger than I thought," said the former, in a low, croaking
tone."How long held out Dalwolsy, when the knight of Liddesdale
prisoned him in his castle of Hermitage?""For a fortnight," answered Dwining; "but he was a strong man, and had
some assistance by grain which fell from a granary above his prison
house.""Were it not better end the matter more speedily?He will demand to see the
Prince, and all must be over ere he comes."They passed on in their dark and fatal conversation."Now gain we the tower," said Catharine to her companion, when she saw
they had left the garden."I had a plan of escape for myself; I will
turn it into one of rescue for the Prince.The dey woman enters the
castle about vesper time, and usually leaves her cloak in the passage as
she goes into the pantlers' office with the milk.Take thou the cloak,
muffle thyself close, and pass the warder boldly; he is usually drunken
at that hour, and thou wilt go as the dey woman unchallenged through
gate and along bridge, if thou bear thyself with confidence.Then away
to meet the Black Douglas; he is our nearest and only aid.""But," said Louise, "is he not that terrible lord who threatened me with
shame and punishment?""Believe it," said Catharine, "such as thou or I never dwelt an hour in
the Douglas's memory, either for good or evil.Tell him that his son in
law, the Prince of Scotland dies--treacherously famished--in Falkland
Castle, and thou wilt merit not pardon only, but reward.""I care not for reward," said Louise; "the deed will reward itself.But
methinks to stay is more dangerous than to go.Let me stay, then, and
nourish the unhappy Prince, and do you depart to bring help.If they
kill me before you return, I leave you my poor lute, and pray you to be
kind to my poor Charlot.""No, Louise," replied Catharine, "you are a more privileged and
experienced wanderer than I--do you go; and if you find me dead on your
return, as may well chance, give my poor father this ring and a lock of
my hair, and say, Catharine died in endeavouring to save the blood of
Bruce.And give this other lock to Henry; say, Catharine thought of him
to the last, and that, if he has judged her too scrupulous touching the
blood of others, he will then know it was not because she valued her
own."They sobbed in each other's arms, and the intervening hours till evening
were spent in endeavouring to devise some better mode of supplying the
captive with nourishment, and in the construction of a tube, composed
of hollow reeds, slipping into each other, by which liquids might be
conveyed to him.The bell of the village church of Falkland tolled to
vespers.The dey, or farm woman, entered with her pitchers to deliver
the milk for the family, and to hear and tell the news stirring.She had
scarcely entered the kitchen when the female minstrel, again throwing
herself in Catharine's arms, and assuring her of her unalterable
fidelity, crept in silence downstairs, the little dog under her arm.A
moment after, she was seen by the breathless Catharine, wrapt in the dey
woman's cloak, and walking composedly across the drawbridge."So," said the warder, "you return early tonight, May Bridget?Small
mirth towards in the hall--ha, wench!"I have forgotten my tallies," said the ready witted French woman, "and
will return in the skimming of a bowie."She went onward, avoiding the village of Falkland, and took a footpath
which led through the park.Catharine breathed freely, and blessed God
when she saw her lost in the distance.It was another anxious hour
for Catharine which occurred before the escape of the fugitive was
discovered.This happened so soon as the dey girl, having taken an hour
to perform a task which ten minutes might have accomplished, was about
to return, and discovered that some one had taken away her grey frieze
cloak.A strict search was set on foot; at length the women of the
house remembered the glee maiden, and ventured to suggest her as one not
unlikely to exchange an old cloak for a new one.The warder, strictly
questioned, averred he saw the dey woman depart immediately after
vespers; and on this being contradicted by the party herself, he could
suggest, as the only alternative, that it must needs have been the
devil.As, however, the glee woman could not be found, the real circumstances
of the case were easily guessed at; and the steward went to inform Sir
John Ramorny and Dwining, who were now scarcely ever separate, of
the escape of one of their female captives.Everything awakens the
suspicions of the guilty.They looked on each other with faces of
dismay, and then went together to the humble apartment of Catharine,
that they might take her as much as possible by surprise while they
inquired into the facts attending Louise's disappearance.said Ramorny, in a tone of
austere gravity."I have no companion here," answered Catharine."Trifle not," replied the knight; "I mean the glee maiden, who lately
dwelt in this chamber with you.""She is gone, they tell me," said Catharine--"gone about an hour since.""How," answered Catharine, "should I know which way a professed wanderer
may choose to travel?She was tired no doubt of a solitary life, so
different from the scenes of feasting and dancing which her trade leads
her to frequent.She is gone, and the only wonder is that she should
have stayed so long.""This, then," said Ramorny, "is all you have to tell us?""All that I have to tell you, Sir John," answered Catharine, firmly;
"and if the Prince himself inquire, I can tell him no more.""There is little danger of his again doing you the honour to speak to
you in person," said Ramorny, "even if Scotland should escape being
rendered miserable by the sad event of his decease.""Is the Duke of Rothsay so very ill?""No help, save in Heaven," answered Ramorny, looking upward."Then may there yet be help there," said Catharine, "if human aid prove
unavailing!"said Ramorny, with the most determined gravity; while Dwining
adopted a face fit to echo the feeling, though it seemed to cost him
a painful struggle to suppress his sneering yet soft laugh of triumph,
which was peculiarly excited by anything having a religious tendency."And it is men--earthly men, and not incarnate devils, who thus appeal
to Heaven, while they are devouring by inches the life blood of their
hapless master!"muttered Catharine, as her two baffled inquisitors left
the apartment.But it will roll ere long, and
oh!may it be to preserve as well as to punish!"The hour of dinner alone afforded a space when, all in the castle being
occupied with that meal, Catharine thought she had the best opportunity
of venturing to the breach in the wall, with the least chance of being
observed.In waiting for the hour, she observed some stir in the castle,
which had been silent as the grave ever since the seclusion of the Duke
of Rothsay.The portcullis was lowered and raised, and the creaking of
the machinery was intermingled with the tramp of horse, as men at arms
went out and returned with steeds hard ridden and covered with foam.She
observed, too, that such domestics as she casually saw from her window
were in arms.All this made her heart throb high, for it augured the
approach of rescue; and besides, the bustle left the little garden more
lonely than ever.At length the hour of noon arrived; she had taken care
to provide, under pretence of her own wishes, which the pantler seemed
disposed to indulge, such articles of food as could be the most easily
conveyed to the unhappy captive.She whispered to intimate her presence;
there was no answer; she spoke louder, still there was silence."He sleeps," she muttered these words half aloud, and with a shuddering
which was succeeded by a start and a scream, when a voice replied behind
her:

"Yes, he sleeps; but it is for ever."Sir John Ramorny stood behind her in complete armour,
but the visor of his helmet was up, and displayed a countenance more
resembling one about to die than to fight.He spoke with a grave tone,
something between that of a calm observer of an interesting event and of
one who is an agent and partaker in it."Catharine," he said, "all is true which I tell you.You
have done your best for him; you can do no more.""I will not--I cannot believe it," said Catharine."Heaven be merciful
to me!it would make one doubt of Providence, to think so great a crime
has been accomplished.""Doubt not of Providence, Catharine, though it has suffered the
profligate to fall by his own devices.Follow me; I have that to say
which concerns you.I say follow (for she hesitated), unless you prefer
being left to the mercies of the brute Bonthron and the mediciner
Henbane Dwining.""I will follow you," said Catharine."You cannot do more to me than you
are permitted."He led the way into the tower, and mounted staircase after staircase and
ladder after ladder."I will follow no farther," she said.If to my death, I can die here.""Only to the battlements of the castle, fool," said Ramorny, throwing
wide a barred door which opened upon the vaulted roof of the castle,
where men were bending mangonels, as they called them (military engines,
that is, for throwing arrows or stones), getting ready crossbows, and
piling stones together.But the defenders did not exceed twenty in
number, and Catharine thought she could observe doubt and irresolution
amongst them."Catharine," said Ramorny, "I must not quit this station, which is
necessary for my defence; but I can speak with you here as well as
elsewhere.""Say on," answered Catharine, "I am prepared to hear you.""You have thrust yourself, Catharine, into a bloody secret.Have you the
firmness to keep it?""I do not understand you, Sir John," answered the maiden.I have slain--murdered, if you will--my late master, the Duke
of Rothsay.The spark of life which your kindness would have fed
was easily smothered.You are
faint--bear up--you have more to hear.You know the crime, but you know
not the provocation.this gauntlet is empty; I lost my right hand
in his cause, and when I was no longer fit to serve him, I was cast off
like a worn out hound, my loss ridiculed, and a cloister recommended,
instead of the halls and palaces in which I had my natural sphere!Think
on this--pity and assist me.""In what manner can you require my assistance?"said the trembling
maiden; "I can neither repair your loss nor cancel your crime.""Thou canst be silent, Catharine, on what thou hast seen and heard in
yonder thicket.It is but a brief oblivion I ask of you, whose word
will, I know, be listened to, whether you say such things were or were
not.That of your mountebank companion, the foreigner, none will hold
to be of a pin point's value.If you grant me this, I will take your
promise for my security, and throw the gate open to those who now
approach it.If you will not promise silence, I defend this castle till
every one perishes, and I fling you headlong from these battlements.Ay, look at them--it is not a leap to be rashly braved.Seven courses of
stairs brought you up hither with fatigue and shortened breath; but you
shall go from the top to the bottom in briefer time than you can breathe
a sigh!Speak the word, fair maid; for you speak to one unwilling to
harm you, but determined in his purpose."Catharine stood terrified, and without power of answering a man who
seemed so desperate; but she was saved the necessity of reply by the
approach of Dwining.He spoke with the same humble conges which at all
times distinguished his manner, and with his usual suppressed ironical
sneer, which gave that manner the lie."I do you wrong, noble sir, to intrude on your valiancie when engaged
with a fair damsel.But I come to ask a trifling question."said Ramorny; "ill news are sport to thee even when
they affect thyself, so that they concern others also.""Hem!--he, he!--I only desired to know if your knighthood proposed the
chivalrous task of defending the castle with your single hand--I crave
pardon, I meant your single arm?The question is worth asking, for I
am good for little to aid the defence, unless you could prevail on the
besiegers to take physic--he, he, he!--and Bonthron is as drunk as ale
and strong waters can make him; and you, he, and I make up the whole
garrison who are disposed for resistance.""Never saw men who showed less stomach to the work," answered
Dwining--"never.Eviot and his companion Buncle now approached, with sullen resolution
in their faces, like men who had made their minds up to resist that
authority which they had so long obeyed.said Ramorny, stepping forward to meet them.Why have you left the barbican, Eviot?And you other fellow,
did I not charge you to look to the mangonels?""We have something to tell you, Sir John Ramorny," answered Eviot."We
will not fight in this quarrel.""How--my own squires control me?""We were your squires and pages, my lord, while you were master of the
Duke of Rothsay's household.It is bruited about the Duke no longer
lives; we desire to know the truth.""What traitor dares spread such falsehoods?""All who have gone out to skirt the forest, my lord, and I myself among
others, bring back the same news.The minstrel woman who left the castle
yesterday has spread the report everywhere that the Duke of Rothsay
is murdered, or at death's door.The Douglas comes on us with a strong
force--"

"And you, cowards, take advantage of an idle report to forsake your
master?""My lord," said Eviot, "let Buncle and myself see the Duke of Rothsay,
and receive his personal orders for defence of this castle, and if we do
not fight to the death in that quarrel, I will consent to be hanged on
its highest turret.But if he be gone by natural disease, we will yield
up the castle to the Earl of Douglas, who is, they say, the King's
lieutenant.Or if--which Heaven forefend!--the noble Prince has had
foul play, we will not involve ourselves in the guilt of using arms in
defence of the murderers, be they who they will.""Eviot," said Ramorny, raising his mutilated arm, "had not that glove
been empty, thou hadst not lived to utter two words of this insolence.""It is as it is," answered Evict, "and we do but our duty.I have
followed you long, my lord, but here I draw bridle.""Farewell, then, and a curse light on all of you!""Our valiancie is about to run away," said the mediciner, who had crept
close to Catharine's side before she was aware."Catharine, thou art a
superstitious fool, like most women; nevertheless thou hast some mind,
and I speak to thee as one of more understanding than the buffaloes
which are herding about us.These haughty barons who overstride the
world, what are they in the day of adversity?Let
their sledge hammer hands or their column resembling legs have injury,
and bah!Heart and courage is nothing to
them, lith and limb everything: give them animal strength, what are they
better than furious bulls; take that away, and your hero of chivalry
lies grovelling like the brute when he is hamstrung.Not so the sage;
while a grain of sense remains in a crushed or mutilated frame, his mind
shall be strong as ever.Catharine, this morning I was practising your
death; but methinks I now rejoice that you may survive to tell how the
poor mediciner, the pill gilder, the mortar pounder, the poison vender,
met his fate, in company with the gallant Knight of Ramorny, Baron in
possession and Earl of Lindores in expectation--God save his lordship!""Old man," said Catharine, "if thou be indeed so near the day of thy
deserved doom, other thoughts were far wholesomer than the vainglorious
ravings of a vain philosophy.Ask to see a holy man--"

"Yes," said Dwining, scornfully, "refer myself to a greasy monk, who
does not--he!he!--understand the barbarous Latin he repeats by
rote.Such would be a fitting counsellor to one who has studied both
in Spain and Arabia!No, Catharine, I will choose a confessor that is
pleasant to look upon, and you shall be honoured with the office.Now,
look yonder at his valiancie, his eyebrow drops with moisture, his lip
trembles with agony; for his valiancie--he!he!--is pleading for his
life with his late domestics, and has not eloquence enough to persuade
them to let him slip.See how the fibres of his face work as he implores
the ungrateful brutes, whom he has heaped with obligations, to permit
him to get such a start for his life as the hare has from the greyhounds
when men course her fairly.Look also at the sullen, downcast, dogged
faces with which, fluctuating between fear and shame, the domestic
traitors deny their lord this poor chance for his life.These things
thought themselves the superior of a man like me!and you, foolish
wench, think so meanly of your Deity as to suppose wretches like them
are the work of Omnipotence!"said Catharine, warmly; "the God I worship
created these men with the attributes to know and adore Him, to guard
and defend their fellow creatures, to practise holiness and virtue.Their own vices, and the temptations of the Evil One, have made them
such as they now are.Oh, take the lesson home to thine own heart of
adamant!Heaven made thee wiser than thy fellows, gave thee eyes to look
into the secrets of nature, a sagacious heart, and a skilful hand; but
thy pride has poisoned all these fair gifts, and made an ungodly atheist
of one who might have been a Christian sage!""Atheist, say'st thou?""Perhaps I have doubts on that
matter--but they will be soon solved.Yonder comes one who will send
me, as he has done thousands, to the place where all mysteries shall be
cleared."Catharine followed the mediciner's eye up one of the forest glades, and
beheld it occupied by a body of horsemen advancing at full gallop.In
the midst was a pennon displayed, which, though its bearings were not
visible to Catharine, was, by a murmur around, acknowledged as that of
the Black Douglas.They halted within arrow shot of the castle, and a
herald with two trumpets advanced up to the main portal, where, after a
loud flourish, he demanded admittance for the high and dreaded Archibald
Earl of Douglas, Lord Lieutenant of the King, and acting for the time
with the plenary authority of his Majesty; commanding, at the same time,
that the inmates of the castle should lay down their arms, all under
penalty of high treason.said Eviot to Ramorny, who stood sullen and undecided."Will
you give orders to render the castle, or must I?"interrupted the knight, "to the last I will command you.Open the gates, drop the bridge, and render the castle to the Douglas.""Now, that's what may be called a gallant exertion of free will," said
Dwining."Just as if the pieces of brass that were screaming a minute
since should pretend to call those notes their own which are breathed
through them by a frowsy trumpeter."said Catharine, "either be silent or turn thy thoughts
to the eternity on the brink of which thou art standing.""Thou canst not, wench,
help hearing what I say to thee, and thou wilt tell it again, for thy
sex cannot help that either.Perth and all Scotland shall know what a
man they have lost in Henbane Dwining!"The clash of armour now announced that the newcomers had dismounted and
entered the castle, and were in the act of disarming the small garrison.Earl Douglas himself appeared on the battlements, with a few of his
followers, and signed to them to take Ramorny and Dwining into custody.Others dragged from some nook the stupefied Bonthron."It was to these three that the custody of the Prince was solely
committed daring his alleged illness?"said the Douglas, prosecuting an
inquiry which he had commenced in the hall of the castle."No other saw him, my lord," said Eviot, "though I offered my services.""Conduct us to the Duke's apartment, and bring the prisoners with
us.Also should there be a female in the castle, if she hath not been
murdered or spirited away--the companion of the glee maiden who brought
the first alarm.""She is here, my lord," said Eviot, bringing Catharine forward.Her beauty and her agitation made some impression even upon the
impassible Earl."Fear nothing, maiden," he said; "thou hast deserved both praise and
reward.Tell to me, as thou wouldst confess to Heaven, the things thou
hast witnessed in this castle."Few words served Catharine to unfold the dreadful story."It agrees," said the Douglas, "with the tale of the glee maiden, from
point to point.They passed to the room which the unhappy Duke of Rothsay had been
supposed to inhabit; but the key was not to be found, and the Earl could
only obtain entrance by forcing the door.On entering, the wasted and
squalid remains of the unhappy Prince were discovered, flung on the bed
as if in haste.The intention of the murderers had apparently been to
arrange the dead body so as to resemble a timely parted corpse, but they
had been disconcerted by the alarm occasioned by the escape of Louise.Douglas looked on the body of the misguided youth, whose wild passions
and caprices had brought him to this fatal and premature catastrophe."I had wrongs to be redressed," he said; "but to see such a sight as
this banishes all remembrance of injury!"It should have been arranged," said Dwining, "more to your
omnipotence's pleasure; but you came suddenly on us, and hasty masters
make slovenly service."Douglas seemed not to hear what his prisoner said, so closely did he
examine the wan and wasted features, and stiffened limbs, of the dead
body before him.Catharine, overcome by sickness and fainting, at length
obtained permission to retire from the dreadful scene, and, through
confusion of every description, found her way to her former apartment,
where she was locked in the arms of Louise, who had returned in the
interval.The dying hand of the Prince
was found to be clenched upon a lock of hair, resembling, in colour and
texture, the coal black bristles of Bonthron.Thus, though famine had
begun the work, it would seem that Rothsay's death had been finally
accomplished by violence.The private stair to the dungeon, the keys of
which were found at the subaltern assassin's belt, the situation of the
vault, its communication with the external air by the fissure in the
walls, and the wretched lair of straw, with the fetters which remained
there, fully confirmed the story of Catharine and of the glee woman."We will not hesitate an instant," said the Douglas to his near kinsman,
the Lord Balveny, as soon as they returned from the dungeon."But, my lord, some trial may be fitting," answered Balveny."I have taken them red hand; my
authority will stretch to instant execution.Yet stay--have we not some
Jedwood men in our troop?""Plenty of Turnbulls, Rutherfords, Ainslies, and so forth," said
Balveny."Call me an inquest of these together; they are all good men and true,
saving a little shifting for their living.Do you see to the execution
of these felons, while I hold a court in the great hall, and we'll try
whether the jury or the provost marshal do their work first; we will
have Jedwood justice--hang in haste and try at leisure.""Yet stay, my lord," said Ramorny, "you may rue your haste--will you
grant me a word out of earshot?"said Douglas; "speak out what thou hast to say before
all that are here present.""Know all; then," said Ramorny, aloud, "that this noble Earl had letters
from the Duke of Albany and myself, sent him by the hand of yon cowardly
deserter, Buncle--let him deny it if he dare--counselling the removal
of the Duke for a space from court, and his seclusion in this Castle of
Falkland.""But not a word," replied Douglas, sternly smiling, "of his being flung
into a dungeon--famished--strangled.Away with the wretches, Balveny,
they pollute God's air too long!"The prisoners were dragged off to the battlements.But while the means
of execution were in the act of being prepared, the apothecary expressed
so ardent a desire to see Catharine once more, and, as he said, for
the good of his soul, that the maiden, in hopes his obduracy might have
undergone some change even at the last hour, consented again to go
to the battlements, and face a scene which her heart recoiled from.A single glance showed her Bonthron, sunk in total and drunken
insensibility; Ramorny, stripped of his armour, endeavouring in vain to
conceal fear, while he spoke with a priest, whose good offices he had
solicited; and Dwining, the same humble, obsequious looking, crouching
individual she had always known him.He held in his hand a little silver
pen, with which he had been writing on a scrap of parchment."Catharine," he said--"he, he, he!--I wish to speak to thee on the
nature of my religious faith.""If such be thy intention, why lose time with me?"The good father," said Dwining, "is--he, he!--already a worshipper of
the deity whom I have served.I therefore prefer to give the altar of
mine idol a new worshipper in thee, Catharine.This scrap of parchment
will tell thee how to make your way into my chapel, where I have
worshipped so often in safety.I leave the images which it contains to
thee as a legacy, simply because I hate and contemn thee something less
than any of the absurd wretches whom I have hitherto been obliged to
call fellow creatures.And now away--or remain and see if the end of the
quacksalver belies his life.""Nay," said the mediciner, "I have but a single word to say, and yonder
nobleman's valiancie may hear it if he will."Lord Balveny approached, with some curiosity; for the undaunted
resolution of a man who never wielded sword or bore armour and was in
person a poor dwindled dwarf, had to him an air of something resembling
sorcery.""You see this trifling implement," said the criminal, showing the
silver pen."By means of this I can escape the power even of the Black
Douglas.""Give him no ink nor paper," said Balveny, hastily, "he will draw a
spell.""Not so, please your wisdom and valiancie--he, he, he!"said Dwining
with his usual chuckle, as he unscrewed the top of the pen, within which
was a piece of sponge or some such substance, no bigger than a pea."Now, mark this--" said the prisoner, and drew it between his lips.He lay a dead corpse before them, the
contemptuous sneer still on his countenance.Catharine shrieked and fled, seeking, by a hasty descent, an escape from
a sight so appalling.Lord Balveny was for a moment stupified, and then
exclaimed, "This may be glamour!hang him over the battlements, quick
or dead.If his foul spirit hath only withdrawn for a space, it shall
return to a body with a dislocated neck."Ramorny and Bonthron were then ordered for
execution.The last was hanged before he seemed quite to comprehend what
was designed to be done with him.Ramorny, pale as death, yet with
the same spirit of pride which had occasioned his ruin, pleaded his
knighthood, and demanded the privilege of dying by decapitation by the
sword, and not by the noose."The Douglas never alters his doom," said Balveny."But thou shalt have
all thy rights.The menial whom he called appeared at his summons."What shakest thou for, fellow?"said Balveny; "here, strike me this
man's gilt spurs from his heels with thy cleaver.And now, John Ramorny,
thou art no longer a knight, but a knave.To the halter with him,
provost marshal!hang him betwixt his companions, and higher than them
if it may be."In a quarter of an hour afterwards, Balveny descended to tell the
Douglas that the criminals were executed."Then there is no further use in the trial," said the Earl."How say
you, good men of inquest, were these men guilty of high treason--ay or
no?""Guilty," exclaimed the obsequious inquest, with edifying unanimity, "we
need no farther evidence.""Sound trumpets, and to horse then, with our own train only; and let
each man keep silence on what has chanced here, until the proceedings
shall be laid before the King, which cannot conveniently be till the
battle of Palm Sunday shall be fought and ended.Select our attendants,
and tell each man who either goes with us or remains behind that he who
prates dies."In a few minutes the Douglas was on horseback, with the followers
selected to attend his person.Expresses were sent to his daughter, the
widowed Duchess of Rothsay, directing her to take her course to Perth,
by the shores of Lochleven, without approaching Falkland, and committing
to her charge Catharine Glover and the glee woman, as persons whose
safety he tendered.As they rode through the forest, they looked back, and beheld the three
bodies hanging, like specks darkening the walls of the old castle."The hand is punished," said Douglas, "but who shall arraign the head by
whose direction the act was done?""I do, kinsman; and were I to listen to the dictates of my heart, I
would charge him with the deed, which I am certain he has authorised.But there is no proof of it beyond strong suspicion, and Albany has
attached to himself the numerous friends of the house of Stuart, to
whom, indeed, the imbecility of the King and the ill regulated habits
of Rothsay left no other choice of a leader.Were I, therefore, to break
the bond which I have so lately formed with Albany, the consequence
must be civil war, an event ruinous to poor Scotland while threatened
by invasion from the activity of the Percy, backed by the treachery
of March.No, Balveny, the punishment of Albany must rest with Heaven,
which, in its own good time, will execute judgment on him and on his
house."The hour is nigh: now hearts beat high;
     Each sword is sharpen'd well;
     And who dares die, who stoops to fly,
     Tomorrow's light shall tell.We are now to recall to our reader's recollection, that Simon Glover and
his fair daughter had been hurried from their residence without having
time to announce to Henry Smith either their departure or the alarming
cause of it.When, therefore, the lover appeared in Curfew Street, on
the morning of their flight, instead of the hearty welcome of the honest
burgher, and the April reception, half joy half censure, which he had
been promised on the part of his lovely daughter, he received only the
astounding intelligence, that her father and she had set off early, on
the summons of a stranger, who had kept himself carefully muffled from
observation.To this, Dorothy, whose talents for forestalling evil, and
communicating her views of it, are known to the reader, chose to add,
that she had no doubt her master and young mistress were bound for the
Highlands, to avoid a visit which had been made since their departure by
two or three apparitors, who, in the name of a Commission appointed by
the King, had searched the house, put seals upon such places as were
supposed to contain papers, and left citations for father and daughter
to appear before the Court of Commission, on a day certain, under pain
of outlawry.All these alarming particulars Dorothy took care to state
in the gloomiest colours, and the only consolation which she afforded
the alarmed lover was, that her master had charged her to tell him to
reside quietly at Perth, and that he should soon hear news of them.This
checked the smith's first resolve, which was to follow them instantly to
the Highlands, and partake the fate which they might encounter.But when he recollected his repeated feuds with divers of the Clan
Quhele, and particularly his personal quarrel with Conachar, who was now
raised to be a high chief, he could not but think, on reflection, that
his intrusion on their place of retirement was more likely to disturb
the safety which they might otherwise enjoy there than be of any service
to them.He was well acquainted with Simon's habitual intimacy with
the chief of the Clan Quhele, and justly augured that the glover would
obtain protection, which his own arrival might be likely to disturb,
while his personal prowess could little avail him in a quarrel with
a whole tribe of vindictive mountaineers.At the same time his heart
throbbed with indignation, when he thought of Catharine being within the
absolute power of young Conachar, whose rivalry he could not doubt, and
who had now so many means of urging his suit.What if the young chief
should make the safety of the father depend on the favour of the
daughter?He distrusted not Catharine's affections, but then her mode
of thinking was so disinterested, and her attachment to her father so
tender, that, if the love she bore her suitor was weighed against his
security, or perhaps his life, it was matter of deep and awful doubt
whether it might not be found light in the balance.Tormented by
thoughts on which we need not dwell, he resolved nevertheless to
remain at home, stifle his anxiety as he might, and await the promised
intelligence from the old man.It came, but it did not relieve his
concern.Sir Patrick Charteris had not forgotten his promise to communicate to
the smith the plans of the fugitives.But, amid the bustle occasioned by
the movement of troops, he could not himself convey the intelligence.He therefore entrusted to his agent, Kitt Henshaw, the task of making it
known.But this worthy person, as the reader knows, was in the interest
of Ramorny, whose business it was to conceal from every one, but
especially from a lover so active and daring as Henry, the real place of
Catharine's residence.Henshaw therefore announced to the anxious smith
that his friend the glover was secure in the Highlands; and though he
affected to be more reserved on the subject of Catharine, he said little
to contradict the belief that she as well as Simon shared the protection
of the Clan Quhele.But he reiterated, in the name of Sir Patrick,
assurances that father and daughter were both well, and that Henry would
best consult his own interest and their safety by remaining quiet and
waiting the course of events.With an agonized heart, therefore, Henry Gow determined to remain quiet
till he had more certain intelligence, and employed himself in finishing
a shirt of mail, which he intended should be the best tempered and the
most finely polished that his skilful hands had ever executed.This
exercise of his craft pleased him better than any other occupation which
he could have adopted, and served as an apology for secluding himself
in his workshop, and shunning society, where the idle reports which were
daily circulated served only to perplex and disturb him.He resolved to
trust in the warm regard of Simon, the faith of his daughter, and the
friendship of the provost, who, having so highly commended his valour
in the combat with Bonthron, would never, he thought, desert him at this
extremity of his fortunes.Time, however, passed on day by day; and
it was not till Palm Sunday was near approaching, that Sir Patrick
Charteris, having entered the city to make some arrangements for the
ensuing combat, bethought himself of making a visit to the Smith of the
Wynd.He entered his workshop with an air of sympathy unusual to him, and
which made Henry instantly augur that he brought bad news.The smith
caught the alarm, and the uplifted hammer was arrested in its descent
upon the heated iron, while the agitated arm that wielded it, strong
before as that of a giant, became so powerless, that it was with
difficulty Henry was able to place the weapon on the ground, instead of
dropping it from his hand."My poor Henry," said Sir Patrick, "I bring you but cold news; they are
uncertain, however, and, if true, they are such as a brave man like you
should not take too deeply to heart.""In God's name, my lord," said Henry, "I trust you bring no evil news of
Simon Glover or his daughter?""Touching themselves," said Sir Patrick, "no: they are safe and well.But as to thee, Henry, my tidings are more cold.Kitt Henshaw has, I
think, apprised thee that I had endeavoured to provide Catharine Glover
with a safe protection in the house of an honourable lady, the Duchess
of Rothsay.But she hath declined the charge, and Catharine hath been
sent to her father in the Highlands.Thou
mayest have heard that Gilchrist MacIan is dead, and that his son
Eachin, who was known in Perth as the apprentice of old Simon, by the
name of Conachar, is now the chief of Clan Quhele; and I heard from one
of my domestics that there is a strong rumour among the MacIans that the
young chief seeks the hand of Catharine in marriage.My domestic learned
this--as a secret, however--while in the Breadalbane country, on some
arrangements touching the ensuing combat.The thing is uncertain but,
Henry, it wears a face of likelihood.""Did your lordship's servant see Simon Glover and his daughter?"said
Henry, struggling for breath, and coughing, to conceal from the provost
the excess of his agitation."He did not," said Sir Patrick; "the Highlanders seemed jealous, and
refused to permit him to speak to the old man, and he feared to alarm
them by asking to see Catharine.Besides, he talks no Gaelic, nor had
his informer much English, so there may be some mistake in the matter.Nevertheless, there is such a report, and I thought it best to tell it
you.But you may be well assured that the wedding cannot go on till the
affair of Palm Sunday be over; and I advise you to take no step till we
learn the circumstances of the matter, for certainty is most desirable,
even when it is painful.Go you to the council house," he added, after a
pause, "to speak about the preparations for the lists in the North Inch?"Well, Smith, I judge by your brief answer that you are discomposed with
this matter; but, after all, women are weathercocks, that is the truth
on't.Solomon and others have proved it before you."And so Sir Patrick Charteris retired, fully convinced he had discharged
the office of a comforter in the most satisfactory manner.With very different impressions did the unfortunate lover regard the
tidings and listen to the consoling commentary."The provost," he said bitterly to himself, "is an excellent man; marry,
he holds his knighthood so high, that, if he speaks nonsense, a poor man
must hold it sense, as he must praise dead ale if it be handed to him
in his lordship's silver flagon.How would all this sound in another
situation?Suppose I were rolling down the steep descent of the
Corrichie Dhu, and before I came to the edge of the rock, comes my Lord
Provost, and cries: 'Henry, there is a deep precipice, and I grieve to
say you are in the fair way of rolling over it.But be not downcast,
for Heaven may send a stone or a bush to stop your progress.However, I
thought it would be comfort to you to know the worst, which you will
be presently aware of.I do not know how many hundred feet deep the
precipice descends, but you may form a judgment when you are at the
bottom, for certainty is certainty.when come you to take
a game at bowls?'And this gossip is to serve instead of any friendly
attempt to save the poor wight's neck!When I think of this, I could go
mad, seize my hammer, and break and destroy all around me.But I will
be calm; and if this Highland kite, who calls himself a falcon, should
stoop at my turtle dove, he shall know whether a burgess of Perth can
draw a bow or not."It was now the Thursday before the fated Palm Sunday, and the champions
on either side were expected to arrive the next day, that they might
have the interval of Saturday to rest, refresh themselves, and prepare
for the combat.Two or three of each of the contending parties were
detached to receive directions about the encampment of their little
band, and such other instructions as might be necessary to the proper
ordering of the field.Henry was not, therefore, surprised at seeing a
tall and powerful Highlander peering anxiously about the wynd in which
he lived, in the manner in which the natives of a wild country examine
the curiosities of one that is more civilized.The smith's heart rose
against the man on account of his country, to which our Perth burgher
bore a natural prejudice, and more especially as he observed the
individual wear the plaid peculiar to the Clan Quhele.The sprig of oak
leaves, worked in silk, intimated also that the individual was one
of those personal guards of young Eachin, upon whose exertions in the
future battle so much reliance was placed by those of their clan.Having observed so much, Henry withdrew into his smithy, for the sight
of the man raised his passion; and, knowing that the Highlander came
plighted to a solemn combat, and could not be the subject of any
inferior quarrel, he was resolved at least to avoid friendly intercourse
with him.In a few minutes, however, the door of the smithy flew open,
and flattering in his tartans, which greatly magnified his actual size,
the Gael entered with the haughty step of a man conscious of a personal
dignity superior to anything which he is likely to meet with.He stood
looking around him, and seemed to expect to be received with courtesy
and regarded with wonder.But Henry had no sort of inclination to
indulge his vanity and kept hammering away at a breastplate which was
lying upon his anvil as if he were not aware of his visitor's presence.(the bandy legged smith), said the Highlander."Those that wish to be crook backed call me so," answered Henry."No offence meant," said the Highlander; "but her own self comes to buy
an armour.""Her own self's bare shanks may trot hence with her," answered Henry; "I
have none to sell.""If it was not within two days of Palm Sunday, herself would make you
sing another song," retorted the Gael."And being the day it is," said Henry, with the same contemptuous
indifference, "I pray you to stand out of my light.""You are an uncivil person; but her own self is fir nan ord too; and she
knows the smith is fiery when the iron is hot.""If her nainsell be hammer man herself, her nainsell may make her nain
harness," replied Henry."And so her nainsell would, and never fash you for the matter; but it
is said, Gow Chrom, that you sing and whistle tunes over the swords and
harnishes that you work, that have power to make the blades cut steel
links as if they were paper, and the plate and mail turn back steel
lances as if they were boddle prins?""They tell your ignorance any nonsense that Christian men refuse to
believe," said Henry."I whistle at my work whatever comes uppermost,
like an honest craftsman, and commonly it is the Highlandman's 'Och hone
for Houghman stares!'"Friend, it is but idle to spur a horse when his legs are ham shackled,"
said the Highlander, haughtily."Her own self cannot fight even now, and
there is little gallantry in taunting her thus.""By nails and hammer, you are right there," said the smith, altering his
tone."But speak out at once, friend, what is it thou wouldst have of
me?I am in no humour for dallying.""A hauberk for her chief, Eachin MacIan," said the Highlander."You are a hammer man, you say?said our
smith, producing from a chest the mail shirt on which he had been lately
employed.The Gael handled it with a degree of admiration which had something of
envy in it.He looked curiously at every part of its texture, and at
length declared it the very best piece of armour that he had ever seen."A hundred cows and bullocks and a good drift of sheep would be e'en
ower cheap an offer," said the Highlandman, by way of tentative; "but
her nainsell will never bid thee less, come by them how she can.""It is a fair proffer," replied Henry; "but gold nor gear will never buy
that harness.I want to try my own sword on my own armour, and I will
not give that mail coat to any one but who will face me for the best of
three blows and a thrust in the fair field; and it is your chief's upon
these terms.""Hut, prut, man--take a drink and go to bed," said the Highlander, in
great scorn.Think ye the captain of the Clan Quhele will
be brawling and battling with a bit Perth burgess body like you?Whisht,
man, and hearken.Her nainsell will do ye mair credit than ever belonged
to your kin.She will fight you for the fair harness hersell.""She must first show that she is my match," said Henry, with a grim
smile.I, one of Eachin MacIan's leichtach, and not your match!""You may try me, if you will.Do you know
how to cast a sledge hammer?""Ay, truly--ask the eagle if he can fly over Farragon.""But before you strive with me, you must first try a cast with one of my
leichtach.Here, Dunter, stand forth for the honour of Perth!And now,
Highlandman, there stands a row of hammers; choose which you will, and
let us to the garden."The Highlander whose name was Norman nan Ord, or Norman of the Hammer,
showed his title to the epithet by selecting the largest hammer of the
set, at which Henry smiled.Dunter, the stout journeyman of the smith,
made what was called a prodigious cast; but the Highlander, making a
desperate effort, threw beyond it by two or three feet, and looked with
an air of triumph to Henry, who again smiled in reply.said the Gael, offering our smith the hammer."Not with that child's toy," said Henry, "which has scarce weight to
fly against the wind.Jannekin, fetch me Sampson; or one of you help the
boy, for Sampson is somewhat ponderous."The hammer now produced was half as heavy again as that which the
Highlander had selected as one of unusual weight.Norman stood
astonished; but he was still more so when Henry, taking his position,
swung the ponderous implement far behind his right haunch joint, and
dismissed it from his hand as if it had flown from a warlike engine.The
air groaned and whistled as the mass flew through it.Down at length it
came, and the iron head sunk a foot into the earth, a full yard beyond
the cast of Norman.The Highlander, defeated and mortified, went to the spot where the
weapon lay, lifted it, poised it in his hand with great wonder, and
examined it closely, as if he expected to discover more in it than a
common hammer.He at length returned it to the owner with a melancholy
smile, shrugging his shoulders and shaking his head as the smith asked
him whether he would not mend his cast."Norman has lost too much at the sport already," he replied."She has
lost her own name of the Hammerer.But does her own self, the Gow Chrom,
work at the anvil with that horse's load of iron?""You shall see, brother," said Henry, leading the way to the smithy."Dunter," he said, "rax me that bar from the furnace"; and uplifting
Sampson, as he called the monstrous hammer, he plied the metal with a
hundred strokes from right to left--now with the right hand, now with
the left, now with both, with so much strength at once and dexterity,
that he worked off a small but beautifully proportioned horseshoe in
half the time that an ordinary smith would have taken for the same
purpose, using a more manageable implement.said the Highlander, "and what for would you be fighting
with our young chief, who is far above your standard, though you were
the best smith ever wrought with wind and fire?"said Henry; "you seem a good fellow, and I'll tell you the
truth.Your master has wronged me, and I give him this harness freely
for the chance of fighting him myself.""Nay, if he hath wronged you he must meet you," said the life guardsman."To do a man wrong takes the eagle's feather out of the chief's bonnet;
and were he the first in the Highlands, and to be sure so is Eachin,
he must fight the man he has wronged, or else a rose falls from his
chaplet.""Will you move him to this," said Henry, "after the fight on Sunday?""Oh, her nainsell will do her best, if the hawks have not got her
nainsell's bones to pick; for you must know, brother, that Clan
Chattan's claws pierce rather deep.""The armour is your chief's on that condition," said Henry; "but I will
disgrace him before king and court if he does not pay me the price.""Deil a fear--deil a fear; I will bring him in to the barrace myself,"
said Norman, "assuredly.""You will do me a pleasure," replied Henry; "and that you may remember
your promise, I will bestow on you this dirk.Look--if you hold it
truly, and can strike between the mail hood and the collar of your
enemy, the surgeon will be needless."The Highlander was lavish in his expressions of gratitude, and took his
leave."I have given him the best mail harness I ever wrought," said the smith
to himself, rather repenting his liberality, "for the poor chance
that he will bring his chief into a fair field with me; and then let
Catharine be his who can win her fairly.But much I dread the youth will
find some evasion, unless he have such luck on Palm Sunday as may induce
him to try another combat.That is some hope, however; for I have often,
ere now, seen a raw young fellow shoot up after his first fight from a
dwarf into a giant queller."Thus, with little hope, but with the most determined resolution, Henry
Smith awaited the time that should decide his fate.What made him augur
the worst was the silence both of the glover and of his daughter."They are ashamed," he said, "to confess the truth to me, and therefore
they are silent."Upon the Friday at noon, the two bands of thirty men each, representing
the contending clans, arrived at the several points where they were to
halt for refreshments.The Clan Quhele was entertained hospitably at the rich abbey of Scone,
while the provost regaled their rivals at his Castle of Kinfauns, the
utmost care being taken to treat both parties with the most punctilious
attention, and to afford neither an opportunity of complaining of
partiality.All points of etiquette were, in the mean while, discussed
and settled by the Lord High Constable Errol and the young Earl of
Crawford, the former acting on the part of the Clan Chattan and the
latter patronising the Clan Quhele.Messengers were passing continually
from the one earl to the other, and they held more than: six meetings
within thirty hours, before the ceremonial of the field could be exactly
arranged.Meanwhile, in case of revival of ancient quarrel, many seeds of
which existed betwixt the burghers and their mountain neighbours, a
proclamation commanded the citizens not to approach within half a mile
of the place where the Highlanders were quartered; while on their part
the intended combatants were prohibited from approaching Perth without
special license.Troops were stationed to enforce this order, who did
their charge so scrupulously as to prevent Simon Glover himself, burgess
and citizen of Perth, from approaching the town, because he owned having
come thither at the same time with the champions of Eachin MacIan, and
wore a plaid around him of their check or pattern.This interruption
prevented Simon from seeking out Henry Wynd and possessing him with a
true knowledge of all that had happened since their separation, which
intercourse, had it taken place, must have materially altered the
catastrophe of our narrative.On Saturday afternoon another arrival took place, which interested the
city almost as much as the preparations for the expected combat.This
was the approach of the Earl Douglas, who rode through the town with a
troop of only thirty horse, but all of whom were knights and gentlemen
of the first consequence.Men's eyes followed this dreaded peer as they
pursue the flight of an eagle through the clouds, unable to ken the
course of the bird of Jove yet silent, attentive, and as earnest in
observing him as if they could guess the object for which he sweeps
through the firmament; He rode slowly through the city, and passed out
at the northern gate.He next alighted at the Dominican convent and
desired to see the Duke of Albany.The Earl was introduced instantly,
and received by the Duke with a manner which was meant to be graceful
and conciliatory, but which could not conceal both art and inquietude.When the first greetings were over, the Earl said with great gravity:
"I bring you melancholy news.Your Grace's royal nephew, the Duke of
Rothsay, is no more, and I fear hath perished by some foul practices."said the Duke' in confusion--"what practices?Who dared
practise on the heir of the Scottish throne?""'Tis not for me to state how these doubts arise," said Douglas; "but
men say the eagle was killed with an arrow fledged from his own wing,
and the oak trunk rent by a wedge of the same wood.""Earl of Douglas," said the Duke of Albany, "I am no reader of riddles.""Nor am I a propounder of them," said Douglas, haughtily, "Your Grace
will find particulars in these papers worthy of perusal.I will go for
half an hour to the cloister garden, and then rejoin you.""You go not to the King, my lord?""No," answered Douglas; "I trust your Grace will agree with me that we
should conceal this great family misfortune from our sovereign till the
business of tomorrow be decided.""If the King heard of this loss, he
could not witness the combat; and if he appear not in person, these men
are likely to refuse to fight, and the whole work is cast loose.But
I pray you sit down, my lord, while I read these melancholy papers
respecting poor Rothsay."He passed the papers through his hands, turning some over with a hasty
glance, and dwelling on others as if their contents had been of the
last importance.When he had spent nearly a quarter of an hour in this
manner, he raised his eyes, and said very gravely: "My lord, in these
most melancholy documents, it is yet a comfort to see nothing which can
renew the divisions in the King's councils, which were settled by the
last solemn agreement between your lordship and myself.My unhappy
nephew was by that agreement to be set aside, until time should send him
a graver judgment.He is now removed by Fate, and our purpose in that
matter is anticipated and rendered unnecessary.""If your Grace," replied the Earl, "sees nothing to disturb the good
understanding which the tranquillity and safety of Scotland require
should exist between us, I am not so ill a friend of my country as to
look closely for such.""I understand you, my Lord of Douglas," said Albany, eagerly."You
hastily judged that I should be offended with your lordship for
exercising your powers of lieutenancy, and punishing the detestable
murderers within my territory of Falkland.Credit me, on the contrary, I
am obliged to your lordship for taking out of my hands the punishment of
these wretches, as it would have broken my heart even to have looked
on them.The Scottish Parliament will inquire, doubtless, into this
sacrilegious deed; and happy am I that the avenging sword has been
in the hand of a man so important as your lordship.Our communication
together, as your lordship must well recollect, bore only concerning a
proposed restraint of my unfortunate nephew until the advance of a year
or two had taught him discretion?""Such was certainly your Grace's purpose, as expressed to me," said the
Earl; "I can safely avouch it.""Why, then, noble earl, we cannot be censured because villains, for
their own revengeful ends, appear to have engrafted a bloody termination
on our honest purpose?""The Parliament will judge it after their wisdom," said Douglas."For my
part, my conscience acquits me.""And mine assoilzies me," said the Duke with solemnity."Now, my lord,
touching the custody of the boy James, who succeeds to his father's
claims of inheritance?""The King must decide it," said Douglas, impatient of the conference."I will consent to his residence anywhere save at Stirling, Doune, or
Falkland.""He is gone," muttered the crafty Albany, "and he must be my ally, yet
feels himself disposed to be my mortal foe.No matter, Rothsay sleeps
with his fathers, James may follow in time, and then--a crown is the
recompense of my perplexities."Thretty for thretty faucht in barreris,
     At Sanct Johnstoun on a day besyde the black freris.At an earlier period of the Christian Church,
the use of any of the days of Passion Week for the purpose of combat
would have been accounted a profanity worthy of excommunication.The
Church of Rome, to her infinite honour, had decided that during the holy
season of Easter, when the redemption of man from his fallen state was
accomplished, the sword of war should be sheathed, and angry monarchs
should respect the season termed the Truce of God.The ferocious
violence of the latter wars betwixt Scotland and England had destroyed
all observance of this decent and religious Ordinance.Very often the
most solemn occasions were chosen by one party for an attack, because
they hoped to find the other engaged in religious duties and unprovided
for defence.Thus the truce, once considered as proper to the season,
had been discontinued; and it became not unusual even to select the
sacred festivals of the church for decision of the trial by combat, to
which this intended contest bore a considerable resemblance.On the present occasion, however, the duties of the day were observed
with the usual solemnity, and the combatants themselves took share in
them.Bearing branches of yew in their hands, as the readiest substitute
for palm boughs, they marched respectively to the Dominican and
Carthusian convents, to hear High Mass, and, by a show at least of
devotion, to prepare themselves for the bloody strife of the day.Great
care had of course been taken that, during this march, they should not
even come within the sound of each other's bagpipes; for it was certain
that, like game cocks exchanging mutual notes of defiance, they would
have sought out and attacked each other before they arrived at the place
of combat.The citizens of Perth crowded to see the unusual procession on the
streets, and thronged the churches where the two clans attended their
devotions, to witness their behaviour, and to form a judgment from
their appearance which was most likely to obtain the advantage in
the approaching conflict.Their demeanour in the church, although not
habitual frequenters of places of devotion, was perfectly decorous; and,
notwithstanding their wild and untamed dispositions, there were few of
the mountaineers who seemed affected either with curiosity or wonder.They appeared to think it beneath their dignity of character to testify
either curiosity or surprise at many things which were probably then
presented to them for the first time.On the issue of the combat, few even of the most competent judges dared
venture a prediction; although the great size of Torquil and his eight
stalwart sons induced some who professed themselves judges of the thewes
and sinews of men to incline to ascribe the advantage to the party of
the Clan Quhele.The opinion of the female sex was much decided by
the handsome form, noble countenance, and gallant demeanour of Eachin
MacIan.There were more than one who imagined they had recollection
of his features, but his splendid military attire rendered the humble
glover's apprentice unrecognisable in the young Highland chief, saving
by one person.That person, as may well be supposed, was the Smith of the Wynd, who
had been the foremost in the crowd that thronged to see the gallant
champions of Clan Quhele.It was with mingled feelings of dislike,
jealousy, and something approaching to admiration that he saw the
glover's apprentice stripped of his mean slough, and blazing forth as a
chieftain, who, by his quick eye and gallant demeanour, the noble shape
of his brow and throat, his splendid arms and well proportioned limbs,
seemed well worthy to hold the foremost rank among men selected to live
or die for the honour of their race.The smith could hardly think that
he looked upon the same passionate boy whom he had brushed off as
he might a wasp that stung him, and, in mere compassion, forebore to
despatch by treading on him."He looks it gallantly with my noble hauberk," thus muttered Henry to
himself, "the best I ever wrought.Yet, if he and I stood together where
there was neither hand to help nor eye to see, by all that is blessed in
this holy church, the good harness should return to its owner!All that
I am worth would I give for three fair blows on his shoulders to undo my
own best work; but such happiness will never be mine.If he escape from
the conflict, it will be with so high a character for courage, that he
may well disdain to put his fortune, in its freshness, to the risk of
an encounter with a poor burgess like myself.He will fight by his
champion, and turn me over to my fellow craftsman the hammerer, when all
I can reap will be the pleasure of knocking a Highland bullock on the
head.I will to the other church in
quest of him, since for sure he must have come down from the Highlands."The congregation was moving from the church of the Dominicans when the
smith formed this determination, which he endeavoured to carry into
speedy execution, by thrusting through the crowd as hastily as the
solemnity of the place and occasion would permit.In making his way
through the press, he was at one instant carried so close to Eachin
that their eyes encountered.The smith's hardy and embrowned countenance
 up like the heated iron on which he wrought, and retained
its dark red hue for several minutes.Eachin's features glowed with a
brighter blush of indignation, and a glance of fiery hatred was shot
from his eyes.But the sudden flush died away in ashy paleness, and his
gaze instantly avoided the unfriendly but steady look with which it was
encountered.Torquil, whose eye never quitted his foster son, saw his emotion, and
looked anxiously around to discover the cause.But Henry was already
at a distance, and hastening on his way to the Carthusian convent.Here
also the religious service of the day was ended; and those who had so
lately borne palms in honour of the great event which brought peace
on earth and goodwill to the children of men were now streaming to
the place of combat--some prepared to take the lives of their fellow
creatures or to lose their own, others to view the deadly strife with
the savage delight which the heathens took in the contests of their
gladiators.The crowd was so great that any other person might well have despaired
of making way through it.But the general deference entertained for
Henry of the Wynd, as the champion of Perth, and the universal sense of
his ability to force a passage, induced all to unite in yielding room
for him, so that he was presently quite close to the warriors of the
Clan Chattan.Their pipers marched at the head of their column.Next
followed the well known banner, displaying a mountain cat rampant, with
the appropriate caution, "Touch not the cat, but (i.e.The chief followed with his two handed sword advanced, as if to
protect the emblem of the tribe.He was a man of middle stature, more
than fifty years old, but betraying neither in features nor form any
decay of strength or symptoms of age.His dark red close curled locks
were in part chequered by a few grizzled hairs, but his step and gesture
were as light in the dance, in the chase, or in the battle as if he had
not passed his thirtieth year.His grey eye gleamed with a wild light
expressive of valour and ferocity mingled; but wisdom and experience
dwelt on the expression of his forehead, eyebrows, and lips.The chosen
champions followed by two and two.There was a cast of anxiety on
several of their faces, for they had that morning discovered the absence
of one of their appointed number; and, in a contest so desperate as was
expected, the loss seemed a matter of importance to all save to their
high mettled chief, MacGillie Chattanach."Say nothing to the Saxons of his absence," said this bold leader, when
the diminution of his force was reported to him."The false Lowland
tongues might say that one of Clan Chattan was a coward, and perhaps
that the rest favoured his escape, in order to have a pretence to avoid
the battle.I am sure that Ferquhard Day will be found in the ranks ere
we are ready for battle; or, if he should not, am not I man enough for
two of the Clan Quhele?or would we not fight them fifteen to thirty,
rather than lose the renown that this day will bring us?"The tribe received the brave speech of their leader with applause, yet
there were anxious looks thrown out in hopes of espying the return of
the deserter; and perhaps the chief himself was the only one of the
determined band who was totally indifferent on the subject.They marched on through the streets without seeing anything of Ferquhard
Day, who, many a mile beyond the mountains, was busied in receiving such
indemnification as successful love could bestow for the loss of honour.MacGillie Chattanach marched on without seeming to observe the absence
of the deserter, and entered upon the North Inch, a beautiful and level
plain, closely adjacent to the city, and appropriated to the martial
exercises of the inhabitants.The plain is washed on one side by the deep and swelling Tay.There was
erected within it a strong palisade, inclosing on three sides a space of
one hundred and fifty yards in length and seventy-four yards in width.The fourth side of the lists was considered as sufficiently fenced
by the river.An amphitheatre for the accommodation of spectators
surrounded the palisade, leaving a large space free to be occupied by
armed men on foot and horseback, and for the more ordinary class of
spectators.At the extremity of the lists which was nearest to the city,
there was a range of elevated galleries for the King and his courtiers,
so highly decorated with rustic treillage, intermingled with gilded
ornaments, that the spot retains to this day the name of the Golden, or
Gilded, Arbour.The mountain minstrelsy, which sounded the appropriate pibrochs or
battle tunes of the rival confederacies, was silent when they entered on
the Inch, for such was the order which had been given.Two stately but
aged warriors, each bearing the banner of his tribe, advanced to the
opposite extremities of the lists, and, pitching their standards into
the earth, prepared to be spectators of a fight in which they were not
to join.The pipers, who were also to be neutral in the strife, took
their places by their respective brattachs.The multitude received both bands with the same general shout with which
on similar occasions they welcome those from whose exertion they expect
amusement, or what they term sport.The destined combatants returned
no answer to this greeting, but each party advanced to the opposite
extremities of the lists, where were entrances by which they were to be
admitted to the interior.A strong body of men at arms guarded either
access; and the Earl Marshal at the one and the Lord High Constable at
the other carefully examined each individual, to see whether he had the
appropriate arms, being steel cap, mail shirt, two handed sword, and
dagger.They also examined the numbers of each party; and great was the
alarm among the multitude when the Earl of Errol held up his hand and
cried: "Ho!The combat cannot proceed, for the Clan Chattan lack one of
their number."said the young Earl of Crawford; "they should have
counted better ere they left home."The Earl Marshal, however, agreed with the Constable that the fight
could not proceed until the inequality should be removed; and a general
apprehension was excited in the assembled multitude that, after all the
preparation, there would be no battle.Of all present there were only two perhaps who rejoiced at the prospect
of the combat being adjourned, and these were the captain of the Clan
Quhele and the tender hearted King Robert.Meanwhile the two chiefs,
each attended by a special friend and adviser, met in the midst of the
lists, having, to assist them in determining what was to be done, the
Earl Marshal, the Lord High Constable, the Earl of Crawford, and Sir
Patrick Charteris.The chief of the Clan Chattan declared himself
willing and desirous of fighting upon the spot, without regard to the
disparity of numbers."That," said Torquil of the Oak, "Clan Quhele will never consent to.You can never win honour from us with the sword, and you seek but a
subterfuge, that you may say when you are defeated, as you know you will
be, that it was for want of the number of your band fully counted out.But I make a proposal: Ferquhard Day was the youngest of your band,
Eachin MacIan is the youngest of ours; we will set him aside in place of
the man who has fled from the combat.""A most unjust and unequal proposal," exclaimed Toshach Beg, the second,
as he might be termed, of MacGillie Chattanach."The life of the chief
is to the clan the breath of our nostrils, nor will we ever consent that
our chief shall be exposed to dangers which the captain of Clan Quhele
does not share."Torquil saw with deep anxiety that his plan was about to fail when the
objection was made to Hector's being withdrawn from the battle, and
he was meditating how to support his proposal, when Eachin himself
interfered.His timidity, it must be observed, was not of that sordid
and selfish nature which induces those who are infected by it calmly
to submit to dishonour rather than risk danger.On the contrary, he was
morally brave, though constitutionally timid, and the shame of avoiding
the combat became at the moment more powerful than the fear of facing
it."I will not hear," he said, "of a scheme which will leave my sword
sheathed during this day's glorious combat.If I am young in arms, there
are enough of brave men around me whom I may imitate if I cannot equal."He spoke these words in a spirit which imposed on Torquil, and perhaps
on the young chief himself."I was sure the foul spell would be broken through, and that the tardy
spirit which besieged him would fly at the sound of the pipe and the
first flutter of the brattach!""Hear me, Lord Marshal," said the Constable."The hour of combat may not
be much longer postponed, for the day approaches to high noon.Let the
chief of Clan Chattan take the half hour which remains, to find, if he
can, a substitute for this deserter; if he cannot, let them fight as
they stand.""Content I am," said the Marshal, "though, as none of his own clan are
nearer than fifty miles, I see not how MacGillis Chattanach is to find
an auxiliary.""That is his business," said the High Constable; "but, if he offers a
high reward, there are enough of stout yeomen surrounding the lists,
who will be glad enough to stretch their limbs in such a game as is
expected.I myself, did my quality and charge permit, would blythely
take a turn of work amongst these wild fellows, and think it fame won."They communicated their decision to the Highlanders, and the chief of
the Clan Chattan replied: "You have judged unpartially and nobly, my
lords, and I deem myself obliged to follow your direction.So make
proclamation, heralds, that, if any one will take his share with Clan
Chattan of the honours and chances of this day, he shall have present
payment of a gold crown, and liberty to fight to the death in my ranks.""You are something chary of your treasure, chief," said the Earl
Marshal: "a gold crown is poor payment for such a campaign as is before
you.""If there be any man willing to fight for honour," replied MacGillis
Chattanach, "the price will be enough; and I want not the service of a
fellow who draws his sword for gold alone."The heralds had made their progress, moving half way round the lists,
stopping from time to time to make proclamation as they had been
directed, without the least apparent disposition on the part of any one
to accept of the proffered enlistment.Some sneered at the poverty of
the Highlanders, who set so mean a price upon such a desperate service.Others affected resentment, that they should esteem the blood of
citizens so lightly.None showed the slightest intention to undertake
the task proposed, until the sound of the proclamation reached Henry of
the Wynd, as he stood without the barrier, speaking from time to time
with Baillie Craigdallie, or rather listening vaguely to what the
magistrate was saying to him."A liberal offer on the part of MacGillie Chattanach," said the host of
the Griffin, "who proposes a gold crown to any one who will turn wildcat
for the day, and be killed a little in his service!exclaimed the smith, eagerly, "do they make proclamation for a
man to fight against the Clan Quhele?""Ay, marry do they," said Griffin; "but I think they will find no such
fools in Perth."He had hardly said the word, when he beheld the smith clear the barriers
at a single bound and alight in the lists, saying: "Here am I, sir
herald, Henry of the Wynd, willing to battle on the part of the Clan
Chattan."A cry of admiration ran through the multitude, while the grave burghers,
not being able to conceive the slightest reason for Henry's behaviour,
concluded that his head must be absolutely turned with the love of
fighting."Thou art mad," he said, "Henry!Thou hast neither two handed sword nor
shirt of mail.""Truly no," said Henry, "for I parted with a mail shirt, which I had
made for myself, to yonder gay chief of the Clan Quhele, who will soon
find on his shoulders with what sort of blows I clink my rivets!As for
two handed sword, why, this boy's brand will serve my turn till I can
master a heavier one.""This must not be," said Errol."Hark thee, armourer, by St.Mary, thou
shalt have my Milan hauberk and good Spanish sword.""I thank your noble earlship, Sir Gilbert Hay, but the yoke with which
your brave ancestor turned the battle at Loncarty would serve my turn
well enough.I am little used to sword or harness that I have not
wrought myself, because I do not well know what blows the one will bear
out without being cracked or the other lay on without snapping."The cry had in the mean while run through the multitude and passed into
the town, that the dauntless smith was about to fight without armour,
when, just as the fated hour was approaching, the shrill voice of a
female was heard screaming for passage through the crowd.The multitude
gave place to her importunity, and she advanced, breathless with haste
under the burden of a mail hauberk and a large two handed sword.The
widow of Oliver Proudfute was soon recognised, and the arms which she
bore were those of the smith himself, which, occupied by her husband on
the fatal evening when he was murdered, had been naturally conveyed
to his house with the dead body, and were now, by the exertions of
his grateful widow, brought to the lists at a moment when such proved
weapons were of the last consequence to their owner.Henry joyfully
received the well known arms, and the widow with trembling haste
assisted in putting them on, and then took leave of him, saying: "God
for the champion of the widow and orphan, and ill luck to all who come
before him!"Confident at feeling himself in his well proved armour, Henry shook
himself as if to settle the steel shirt around him, and, unsheathing
the two handed sword, made it flourish over his head, cutting the air
through which it whistled in the form of the figure eight with an ease
and sleight of hand that proved how powerfully and skilfully he could
wield the ponderous weapon.The champions were now ordered to march
in their turns around the lists, crossing so as to avoid meeting each
other, and making obeisance as they passed the Golden Arbour where the
King was seated.While this course was performing, most of the spectators were again
curiously comparing the stature, limbs, and sinews of the two parties,
and endeavouring to form a conjecture an to the probable issue of the
combat.The feud of a hundred years, with all its acts of aggression
and retaliation, was concentrated in the bosom of each combatant.Their
countenances seemed fiercely writhen into the wildest expression of
pride, hate, and a desperate purpose of fighting to the very last.The spectators murmured a joyful applause, in high wrought expectation
of the bloody game.Wagers were offered and accepted both on the general
issue of the conflict and on the feats of particular champions.The
clear, frank, and elated look of Henry Smith rendered him a general
favourite among the spectators, and odds, to use the modern expression,
were taken that he would kill three of his opponents before he himself
fell.Scarcely was the smith equipped for the combat, when the commands of the
chiefs ordered the champions into their places; and at the same moment
Henry heard the voice of Simon Glover issuing from the crowd, who were
now silent with expectation, and calling on him: "Harry Smith--Harry
Smith, what madness hath possessed thee?""Ay, he wishes to save his hopeful son in law that is, or is to be, from
the smith's handling," was Henry's first thought; his second was to turn
and speak with him; and his third, that he could on no pretext desert
the band which he had joined, or even seem desirous to delay the fight,
consistently with honour.He turned himself, therefore, to the business of the hour.Both parties
were disposed by the respective chiefs in three lines, each containing
ten men.They were arranged with such intervals between each individual
as offered him scope to wield his sword, the blade of which was five
feet long, not including the handle.The second and third lines were
to come up as reserves, in case the first experienced disaster.On the
right of the array of Clan Quhele, the chief, Eachin MacIan, placed
himself in the second line betwixt two of his foster brothers.Four of
them occupied the right of the first line, whilst the father and
two others protected the rear of the beloved chieftain.Torquil, in
particular, kept close behind, for the purpose of covering him.Thus
Eachin stood in the centre of nine of the strongest men of his band,
having four especial defenders in front, one on each hand, and three in
his rear.The line of the Clan Chattan was arranged in precisely the same order,
only that the chief occupied the centre of the middle rank, instead of
being on the extreme right.This induced Henry Smith, who saw in the
opposing bands only one enemy, and that was the unhappy Eachin, to
propose placing himself on the left of the front rank of the Clan
Chattan.But the leader disapproved of this arrangement; and having
reminded Henry that he owed him obedience, as having taken wages at his
hand, he commanded him to occupy the space in the third line immediately
behind himself--a post of honour, certainly, which Henry could not
decline, though he accepted of it with reluctance.When the clans were thus drawn up opposed to each other, they intimated
their feudal animosity and their eagerness to engage by a wild scream,
which, uttered by the Clan Quhele, was answered and echoed back by
the Clan Chattan, the whole at the same time shaking their swords and
menacing each other, as if they meant to conquer the imagination of
their opponents ere they mingled in the actual strife.At this trying moment, Torquil, who had never feared for himself, was
agitated with alarm on the part of his dault, yet consoled by observing
that he kept a determined posture, and that the few words which he spoke
to his clan were delivered boldly, and well calculated to animate them
to combat, as expressing his resolution to partake their fate in death
or victory.The trumpets
of the King sounded a charge, the bagpipes blew up their screaming and
maddening notes, and the combatants, starting forward in regular order,
and increasing their pace till they came to a smart run, met together
in the centre of the ground, as a furious land torrent encounters an
advancing tide.For an instant or two the front lines, hewing at each other with their
long swords, seemed engaged in a succession of single combats; but the
second and third ranks soon came up on either side, actuated alike by
the eagerness of hatred and the thirst of honour, pressed through the
intervals, and rendered the scene a tumultuous chaos, over which the
huge swords rose and sunk, some still glittering, others streaming with
blood, appearing, from the wild rapidity with which they were swayed,
rather to be put in motion by some complicated machinery than to
be wielded by human hands.Some of the combatants, too much crowded
together to use those long weapons, had already betaken themselves to
their poniards, and endeavoured to get within the sword sweep of those
opposed to them.In the mean time, blood flowed fast, and the groans of
those who fell began to mingle with the cries of those who fought; for,
according to the manner of the Highlanders at all times, they could
hardly be said to shout, but to yell.Those of the spectators whose
eyes were best accustomed to such scenes of blood and confusion could
nevertheless discover no advantage yet acquired by either party.The
conflict swayed, indeed, at different intervals forwards or backwards,
but it was only in momentary superiority, which the party who acquired
it almost instantly lost by a corresponding exertion on the other side.The wild notes of the pipers were still heard above the tumult, and
stimulated to farther exertions the fury of the combatants.At once, however, and as if by mutual agreement, the instruments sounded
a retreat; it was expressed in wailing notes, which seemed to imply a
dirge for the fallen.The two parties disengaged themselves from each
other, to take breath for a few minutes.The eyes of the spectators
greedily surveyed the shattered array of the combatants as they drew
off from the contest, but found it still impossible to decide which had
sustained the greater loss.It seemed as if the Clan Chattan had lost
rather fewer men than their antagonists; but in compensation, the bloody
plaids and skirts of their party (for several on both sides had thrown
their mantles away) showed more wounded men than the Clan Quhele.About
twenty of both sides lay on the field dead or dying; and arms and legs
lopped off, heads cleft to the chin, slashes deep through the shoulder
into the breast, showed at once the fury of the combat, the ghastly
character of the weapons used, and the fatal strength of the arms which
wielded them.The chief of the Clan Chattan had behaved himself with
the most determined courage, and was slightly wounded.Eachin also had
fought with spirit, surrounded by his bodyguard.His sword was bloody,
his bearing bold and warlike; and he smiled when old Torquil, folding
him in his arms, loaded him with praises and with blessings.The two chiefs, after allowing their followers to breathe for the space
of about ten minutes, again drew up in their files, diminished by nearly
one third of their original number.They now chose their ground nearer
to the river than that on which they had formerly encountered, which
was encumbered with the wounded and the slain.Some of the former were
observed, from time to time, to raise themselves to gain a glimpse of
the field, and sink back, most of them to die from the effusion of blood
which poured from the terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore.Harry Smith was easily distinguished by his Lowland habit, as well as
his remaining on the spot where they had first encountered, where he
stood leaning on a sword beside a corpse, whose bonneted head, carried
to ten yards' distance from the body by the force of the blow which had
swept it off, exhibited the oak leaf, the appropriate ornament of the
bodyguard of Eachin MacIan.Since he slew this man, Henry had not struck
a blow, but had contented himself with warding off many that were dealt
at himself, and some which were aimed at the chief.MacGillie Chattanach
became alarmed, when, having given the signal that his men should again
draw together, he observed that his powerful recruit remained at a
distance from the ranks, and showed little disposition to join them."Can so strong a body have a mean
and cowardly spirit?"You as good as called me hireling but now," replied Henry."If I am
such," pointing to the headless corpse, "I have done enough for my day's
wage.""He that serves me without counting his hours," replied the chief, "I
reward him without reckoning wages.""Then," said the smith, "I fight as a volunteer, and in the post which
best likes me.""All that is at your own discretion," replied MacGillis Chattanach, who
saw the prudence of humouring an auxiliary of such promise."It is enough," said Henry; and, shouldering his heavy weapon, he joined
the rest of the combatants with alacrity, and placed himself opposite to
the chief of the Clan Quhele.It was then, for the first time, that Eachin showed some uncertainty.He had long looked up to Henry as the best combatant which Perth and its
neighbourhood could bring into the lists.His hatred to him as a rival
was mingled with recollection of the ease with which he had once, though
unarmed, foiled his own sudden and desperate attack; and when he beheld
him with his eyes fixed in his direction, the dripping sword in his
hand, and obviously meditating an attack on him individually, his
courage fell, and he gave symptoms of wavering, which did not escape his
foster father.It was lucky for Eachin that Torquil was incapable, from the formation
of his own temper, and that of those with whom he had lived, to conceive
the idea of one of his own tribe, much less of his chief and foster
son, being deficient in animal courage.Could he have imagined this, his
grief and rage might have driven him to the fierce extremity of taking
Eachin's life, to save him from staining his honour.But his mind
rejected the idea that his dault was a personal coward, as something
which was monstrous and unnatural.That he was under the influence of
enchantment was a solution which superstition had suggested, and he now
anxiously, but in a whisper, demanded of Hector: "Does the spell now
darken thy spirit, Eachin?""Yes, wretch that I am," answered the unhappy youth; "and yonder stands
the fell enchanter!"exclaimed Torquil, "and you wear harness of his making?Norman,
miserable boy, why brought you that accursed mail?""If my arrow has flown astray, I can but shoot my life after it,"
answered Norman nan Ord."Stand firm, you shall see me break the spell.""Yes, stand firm," said Torquil."He may be a fell enchanter; but my own
ear has heard, and my own tongue has told, that Eachin shall leave the
battle whole, free, and unwounded; let us see the Saxon wizard who can
gainsay that.He may be a strong man, but the fair forest of the oak
shall fall, stock and bough, ere he lay a finger on my dault.Ring
around him, my sons; bas air son Eachin!"The sons of Torquil shouted back the words, which signify, "Death for
Hector."Encouraged by their devotion, Eachin renewed his spirit, and called
boldly to the minstrels of his clan, "Seid suas" that is, "Strike up."The wild pibroch again sounded the onset; but the two parties approached
each other more slowly than at first, as men who knew and respected
each other's valour.Henry Wynd, in his impatience to begin the contest,
advanced before the Clan Chattan and signed to Eachin to come on.Norman, however, sprang forward to cover his foster brother, and there
was a general, though momentary, pause, as if both parties were willing
to obtain an omen of the fate of the day from the event of this duel.The Highlander advanced, with his large sword uplifted, as in act to
strike; but, just as he came within sword's length, he dropt the long
and cumbrous weapon, leapt lightly over the smith's sword, as he fetched
a cut at him, drew his dagger, and, being thus within Henry's guard,
struck him with the weapon (his own gift) on the side of the throat,
directing the blow downwards into the chest, and calling aloud, at the
same time, "You taught me the stab!"But Henry Wynd wore his own good hauberk, doubly defended with a lining
of tempered steel.Had he been less surely armed, his combats had been
ended for ever.Even as it was, he was slightly wounded.he replied, striking Norman a blow with the pommel of his long
sword, which made him stagger backwards, "you were taught the thrust,
but not the parry"; and, fetching a blow at his antagonist, which cleft
his skull through the steel cap, he strode over the lifeless body to
engage the young chief, who now stood open before him.But the sonorous voice of Torquil thundered out, "Far eil air son
Eachin!"and the two brethren who flanked their
chief on each side thrust forward upon Henry, and, striking both at
once, compelled him to keep the defensive.cried MacGillie Chattanach."Save the
brave Saxon; let these kites feel your talons!"Already much wounded, the chief dragged himself up to the smith's
assistance, and cut down one of the leichtach, by whom he was assailed.Henry's own good sword rid him of the other.answered two more of his
devoted sons, and opposed themselves to the fury of the smith and those
who had come to his aid; while Eachin, moving towards the left wing of
the battle, sought less formidable adversaries, and again, by some show
of valour, revived the sinking hopes of his followers.The two children
of the oak, who had covered, this movement, shared the fate of their
brethren; for the cry of the Clan Chattan chief had drawn to that part
of the field some of his bravest warriors.The sons of Torquil did not
fall unavenged, but left dreadful marks of their swords on the persons
of the dead and living.But the necessity of keeping their most
distinguished soldiers around the person of their chief told to
disadvantage on the general event of the combat; and so few were now
the number who remained fighting, that it was easy to see that the Clan
Chattan had fifteen of their number left, though most of them wounded,
and that of the Clan Quhele only about ten remained, of whom there were
four of the chief's bodyguard, including Torquil himself.They fought and struggled on, however, and as their strength decayed,
their fury seemed to increase.Henry Wynd, now wounded in many places,
was still bent on breaking through, or exterminating, the band of bold
hearts who continued to fight around the object of his animosity.But still the father's shout of "Another for Hector!"was cheerfully
answered by the fatal countersign, "Death for Hector!"and though the
Clan Quhele were now outnumbered, the combat seemed still dubious.It
was bodily lassitude alone that again compelled them to another pause.The Clan Chattan were then observed to be twelve in number, but two or
three were scarce able to stand without leaning on their swords.Five
were left of the Clan Quhele; Torquil and his youngest son were of the
number, both slightly wounded.Eachin alone had, from the vigilance
used to intercept all blows levelled against his person, escaped without
injury.The rage of both parties had sunk, through exhaustion, into
sullen desperation.They walked staggering, as if in their sleep,
through the carcasses of the slain, and gazed on them, as if again to
animate their hatred towards their surviving enemies by viewing the
friends they had lost.The multitude soon after beheld the survivors of the desperate conflict
drawing together to renew the exterminating feud on the banks of the
river, as the spot least slippery with blood, and less encumbered with
the bodies of the slain."For God's sake--for the sake of the mercy which we daily pray for,"
said the kind hearted old King to the Duke of Albany, "let this be
ended!Wherefore should these wretched rags and remnants of humanity be
suffered to complete their butchery?Surely they will now be ruled, and
accept of peace on moderate terms?""Compose yourself, my liege," said his brother."These men are the pest
of the Lowlands.Both chiefs are still living; if they go back unharmed,
the whole day's work is cast away.Remember your promise to the council,
that you would not cry 'hold.'""You compel me to a great crime, Albany, both as a king, who should
protect his subjects, and as a Christian man, who respects the brother
of his faith.""You judge wrong, my lord," said the Duke: "these are not loving
subjects, but disobedient rebels, as my Lord of Crawford can bear
witness; and they are still less Christian men, for the prior of the
Dominicans will vouch for me that they are more than half heathen.""You must work your pleasure, and are too wise
for me to contend with.I can but turn away and shut my eyes from the
sights and sounds of a carnage which makes me sicken.But well I know
that God will punish me even for witnessing this waste of human life.""Sound, trumpets," said Albany; "their wounds will stiffen if they dally
longer."While this was passing, Torquil was embracing and encouraging his young
chief."Resist the witchcraft but a few minutes longer!Be of good cheer, you
will come off without either scar or scratch, wem or wound."How can I be of good cheer," said Eachin, "while my brave kinsmen have
one by one died at my feet--died all for me, who could never deserve the
least of their kindness?""And for what were they born, save to die for their chief?""Why lament that the arrow returns not to the
quiver, providing it hit the mark?Here are Tormot and I
but little hurt, while the wildcats drag themselves through the plain
as if they were half throttled by the terriers.Yet one brave stand, and
the day shall be your own, though it may well be that you alone remain
alive.The pipers on both sides blew their charge, and the combatants again
mingled in battle, not indeed with the same strength, but with unabated
inveteracy.They were joined by those whose duty it was to have remained
neuter, but who now found themselves unable to do so.The two old
champions who bore the standards had gradually advanced from the
extremity of the lists, and now approached close to the immediate scene
of action.When they beheld the carnage more nearly, they were mutually
impelled by the desire to revenge their brethren, or not to survive
them.They attacked each other furiously with the lances to which the
standards were attached, closed after exchanging several deadly thrusts,
then grappled in close strife, still holding their banners, until at
length, in the eagerness of their conflict, they fell together into the
Tay, and were found drowned after the combat, closely locked in each
other's arms.The fury of battle, the frenzy of rage and despair,
infected next the minstrels.The two pipers, who, during the conflict,
had done their utmost to keep up the spirits of their brethren, now saw
the dispute well nigh terminated for want of men to support it.They
threw down their instruments, rushed desperately upon each other with
their daggers, and each being more intent on despatching his opponent
than in defending himself, the piper of Clan Quhele was almost instantly
slain and he of Clan Chattan mortally wounded.The last, nevertheless,
again grasped his instrument, and the pibroch of the clan yet poured
its expiring notes over the Clan Chattan, while the dying minstrel had
breath to inspire it.The instrument which he used, or at least that
part of it called the chanter, is preserved in the family of a Highland
chief to this day, and is much honoured under the name of the federan
dhu, or, "black chanter."'Meanwhile, in the final charge, young Tormot, devoted, like his
brethren, by his father Torquil to the protection of his chief, had
been mortally wounded by the unsparing sword of the smith.The other
two remaining of the Clan Quhele had also fallen, and Torquil, with his
foster son and the wounded Tormot, forced to retreat before eight or ten
of the Clan Chattan, made a stand on the bank of the river, while their
enemies were making such exertions as their wounds would permit to come
up with them.Torquil had just reached the spot where he had resolved
to make the stand, when the young Tormot dropped and expired.His death
drew from his father the first and only sigh which he had breathed
throughout the eventful day.he said, "my youngest and dearest!But if I save
Hector, I save all.Now, my darling dault, I have done for thee all that
man may, excepting the last.Let me undo the clasps of that ill omened
armour, and do thou put on that of Tormot; it is light, and will fit
thee well.While you do so, I will rush on these crippled men, and make
what play with them I can.I trust I shall have but little to do, for
they are following each other like disabled steers.At least, darling of
my soul, if I am unable to save thee, I can show thee how a man should
die."While Torquil thus spoke, he unloosed the clasps of the young chief's
hauberk, in the simple belief that he could thus break the meshes which
fear and necromancy had twined about his heart."My father--my father--my more than parent," said the unhappy Eachin,
"stay with me!With you by my side, I feel I can fight to the last.""It is impossible," said Torquil."I will stop them coming up, while you
put on the hauberk.God eternally bless thee, beloved of my soul!"And then, brandishing his sword, Torquil of the Oak rushed forward
with the same fatal war cry which had so often sounded over that bloody
field, "Bas air son Eachin!"The words rung three times in a voice of
thunder; and each time that he cried his war shout he struck down one of
the Clan Chattan as he met them successively straggling towards him."Brave battle, hawk--well flown, falcon!"exclaimed the multitude,
as they witnessed exertions which seemed, even at this last hour, to
threaten a change of the fortunes of the day.Suddenly these cries were
hushed into silence, and succeeded by a clashing of swords so dreadful,
as if the whole conflict had recommenced in the person of Henry Wynd and
Torquil of the Oak.They cut, foined, hewed, and thrust as if they had
drawn their blades for the first time that day; and their inveteracy was
mutual, for Torquil recognised the foul wizard who, as he supposed, had
cast a spell over his child; and Henry saw before him the giant who,
during the whole conflict, had interrupted the purpose for which alone
he had joined the combatants--that of engaging in single combat with
Hector.They fought with an equality which, perhaps, would not have
existed, had not Henry, more wounded than his antagonist, been somewhat
deprived of his usual agility.Meanwhile Eachin, finding himself alone, after a disorderly and vain
attempt to put on his foster brother's harness, became animated by an
emotion of shame and despair, and hurried forward to support his foster
father in the terrible struggle, ere some other of the Clan Chattan
should come up.When he was within five yards, and sternly determined
to take his share in the death fight, his foster father fell, cleft
from the collarbone well nigh to the heart, and murmuring with his last
breath, "Bas air son Eachin!"The unfortunate youth saw the fall of
his last friend, and at the same moment beheld the deadly enemy who had
hunted him through the whole field standing within sword's point of
him, and brandishing the huge weapon which had hewed its way to his
life through so many obstacles.Perhaps this was enough to bring his
constitutional timidity to its highest point; or perhaps he recollected
at the same moment that he was without defensive armour, and that a
line of enemies, halting indeed and crippled, but eager for revenge and
blood, were closely approaching.It is enough to say, that his heart
sickened, his eyes darkened, his ears tingled, his brain turned giddy,
all other considerations were lost in the apprehension of instant death;
and, drawing one ineffectual blow at the smith, he avoided that which
was aimed at him in return by bounding backward; and, ere the former
could recover his weapon, Eachin had plunged into the stream of the Tay.A roar of contumely pursued him as he swam across the river, although,
perhaps, not a dozen of those who joined in it would have behaved
otherwise in the like circumstances.Henry looked after the fugitive in
silence and surprise, but could not speculate on the consequences of
his flight, on account of the faintness which seemed to overpower him
as soon as the animation of the contest had subsided.He sat down on
the grassy bank, and endeavoured to stanch such of his wounds as were
pouring fastest.The victors had the general meed of gratulation.The Duke of Albany and
others went down to survey the field; and Henry Wynd was honoured with
particular notice."If thou wilt follow me, good fellow," said the Black Douglas, "I
will change thy leathern apron for a knight's girdle, and thy burgage
tenement for an hundred pound land to maintain thy rank withal.""I thank you humbly, my lord," said the smith, dejectedly, "but I have
shed blood enough already, and Heaven has punished me by foiling the
only purpose for which I entered the combat.""Didst thou not fight for the Clan Chattan,
and have they not gained a glorious conquest?""I fought for my own hand," [meaning, I did such a thing for my own
pleasure, not for your profit] said the smith, indifferently; and the
expression is still proverbial in Scotland.The good King Robert now came up on an ambling palfrey, having entered
the barriers for the purpose of causing the wounded to be looked after."My lord of Douglas," he said, "you vex the poor man with temporal
matters when it seems he may have short timer to consider those that
are spiritual.Has he no friends here who will bear him where his bodily
wounds and the health of his soul may be both cared for?""He hath as many friends as there are good men in Perth," said Sir
Patrick Charteris, "and I esteem myself one of the closest.""A churl will savour of churl's kind," said the haughty Douglas, turning
his horse aside; "the proffer of knighthood from the sword of Douglas
had recalled him from death's door, had there been a drop of gentle
blood in his body."Disregarding the taunt of the mighty earl, the Knight of Kinfauns
dismounted to take Henry in his arms, as he now sunk back from very
faintness.But he was prevented by Simon Glover, who, with other
burgesses of consideration, had now entered the barrace."Oh, what tempted you
to this fatal affray?"No--not speechless," said Henry."Catharine--" He could utter no more."Catharine is well, I trust, and shall be thine--that is, if--"

"If she be safe, thou wouldst say, old man," said the Douglas, who,
though something affronted at Henry's rejection of his offer, was too
magnanimous not to interest himself in what was passing."She is safe,
if Douglas's banner can protect her--safe, and shall be rich.Douglas
can give wealth to those who value it more than honour.""For her safety, my lord, let the heartfelt thanks and blessings of a
father go with the noble Douglas.said the Earl: "a churl refuses nobility, a citizen despises
gold!""Under your lordship's favour," said Sir Patrick, "I, who am knight
and noble, take license to say, that such a brave man as Henry Wynd may
reject honourable titles, such an honest man as this reverend citizen
may dispense with gold.""You do well, Sir Patrick, to speak for your town, and I take no
offence," said the Douglas.But," he
added, in a whisper to Albany, "your Grace must withdraw the King from
this bloody sight, for he must know that tonight which will ring over
broad Scotland when tomorrow dawns.Yet even I
grieve that so many brave Scottishmen lie here slain, whose brands might
have decided a pitched field in their country's cause."With dignity King Robert was withdrawn from the field, the tears running
down his aged cheeks and white beard, as he conjured all around him,
nobles and priests, that care should be taken for the bodies and souls
of the few wounded survivors, and honourable burial rendered to
the slain.The priests who were present answered zealously for both
services, and redeemed their pledge faithfully and piously.Thus ended this celebrated conflict of the North Inch of Perth.Of
sixty-four brave men (the minstrels and standard bearers included)
who strode manfully to the fatal field, seven alone survived, who were
conveyed from thence in litters, in a case little different from the
dead and dying around them, and mingled with them in the sad procession
which conveyed them from the scene of their strife.Eachin alone had
left it void of wounds and void of honour.It remains but to say, that not a man of the Clan Quhele survived the
bloody combat except the fugitive chief; and the consequence of the
defeat was the dissolution of their confederacy.The clans of which it
consisted are now only matter of conjecture to the antiquary, for, after
this eventful contest, they never assembled under the same banner.The
Clan Chattan, on the other hand, continued to increase and flourish; and
the best families of the Northern Highlands boast their descent from the
race of the Cat a Mountain.While the King rode slowly back to the convent which he then occupied,
Albany, with a discomposed aspect and faltering voice, asked the Earl of
Douglas: "Will not your lordship, who saw this most melancholy scene at
Falkland, communicate the tidings to my unhappy brother?""Not for broad Scotland," said the Douglas."I would sooner bare my
breast, within flight shot, as a butt to an hundred Tynedale bowmen.I could but say I saw the ill fated youth dead.How he came by his death, your Grace can perhaps better explain.Were it
not for the rebellion of March and the English war, I would speak my own
mind of it."So saying, and making his obeisance to the King, the Earl rode off to
his own lodgings, leaving Albany to tell his tale as he best could."Ay, and
thine own interest, haughty earl, which, imperious as thou art, thou
darest not separate from mine.Well, since the task falls on me, I must
and will discharge it."The King looked at him with
surprise after he had assumed his usual seat."Thy countenance is ghastly, Robin," said the King."I would thou
wouldst think more deeply when blood is to be spilled, since its
consequences affect thee so powerfully.And yet, Robin, I love thee the
better that thy kind nature will sometimes show itself, even through thy
reflecting policy.""I would to Heaven, my royal brother," said Albany, with a voice half
choked, "that the bloody field we have seen were the worst we had to see
or hear of this day.I should waste little sorrow on the wild kerne who
lie piled on it like carrion.It must
be--it is Rothsay!"My lord--my liege, folly and mischance are now ended with my hapless
nephew.""Albany, as
thy brother, I conjure thee!But no, I am thy brother no longer.As thy
king, dark and subtle man, I charge thee to tell the worst."Albany faltered out: "The details are but imperfectly known to me; but
the certainty is, that my unhappy nephew was found dead in his apartment
last night from sudden illness--as I have heard.""Oh, Rothsay!--Oh, my beloved David!Would to God I had died for thee,
my son--my son!"So spoke, in the emphatic words of Scripture, the helpless and bereft
father, tearing his grey beard and hoary hair, while Albany, speechless
and conscience struck, did not venture to interrupt the tempest of his
grief.But the agony of the King's sorrow almost instantly changed to
fury--a mood so contrary to the gentleness and timidity of his nature,
that the remorse of Albany was drowned in his fear."And this is the end," said the King, "of thy moral saws and religious
maxims!But the besotted father who gave the son into thy hands--who
gave the innocent lamb to the butcher--is a king, and thou shalt know
it to thy cost.Shall the murderer stand in presence of his
brother--stained with the blood of that brother's son?What ho,
without there!--MacLouis!--Brandanes!Take arms, if
you love the Stuart!"MacLouis, with several of the guards, rushed into the apartment."Brandanes, your
noble Prince--" Here his grief and agitation interrupted for a moment
the fatal information it was his object to convey.At length he resumed
his broken speech: "An axe and a block instantly into the courtyard!Arrest--" The word choked his utterance."Arrest whom, my noble liege?"said MacLouis, who, observing the King
influenced by a tide of passion so different from the gentleness of his
ordinary demeanour, almost conjectured that his brain had been disturbed
by the unusual horrors of the combat he had witnessed."Whom shall I arrest, my liege?""Here is none but your
Grace's royal brother of Albany.""Most true," said the King, his brief fit of vindictive passion
soon dying away."Most true--none but Albany--none but my parent's
child--none but my brother.O God, enable me to quell the sinful passion
which glows in this bosom.Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis!"MacLouis cast a look of wonder towards the Duke of Albany, who
endeavoured to hide his confusion under an affectation of deep sympathy,
and muttered to the officer: "The great misfortune has been too much for
his understanding."not heard of the death of my nephew Rothsay?""The Duke of Rothsay dead, my Lord of Albany?"exclaimed the faithful
Brandane, with the utmost horror and astonishment."Two days since--the manner as yet unknown--at Falkland."MacLouis gazed at the Duke for an instant; then, with a kindling eye
and determined look, said to the King, who seemed deeply engaged in his
mental devotion: "My liege!a minute or two since you left a word--one
word--unspoken.Let it pass your lips, and your pleasure is law to your
Brandanes!""I was praying against temptation, MacLouis," said the heart broken
King, "and you bring it to me.Would you arm a madman with a
drawn weapon?my friend--my brother--my bosom
counsellor--how--how camest thou by the heart to do this?"Albany, seeing that the King's mood was softening, replied with more
firmness than before: "My castle has no barrier against the power of
death.I have not deserved the foul suspicions which your Majesty's
words imply.I pardon them, from the distraction of a bereaved father.But I am willing to swear by cross and altar, by my share in salvation,
by the souls of our royal parents--"

"Be silent, Robert!"said the King: "add not perjury to murder.And was
this all done to gain a step nearer to a crown and sceptre?Take them
to thee at once, man; and mayst thou feel as I have done, that they are
both of red hot iron!thou hast at least escaped
being a king!""My liege," said MacLouis, "let me remind you that the crown and sceptre
of Scotland are, when your Majesty ceases to bear them, the right of
Prince James, who succeeds to his brother's rights.""True, MacLouis," said the King, eagerly, "and will succeed, poor child,
to his brother's perils!You have reminded
me that I have still work upon earth.Get thy Brandanes under arms with
what speed thou canst.Let no man go with us whose truth is not known to
thee.None in especial who has trafficked with the Duke of Albany--that
man, I mean, who calls himself my brother--and order my litter to
be instantly prepared.We will to Dunbarton, MacLouis, or to Bute.Precipices, and tides, and my Brandanes' hearts shall defend the child
till we can put oceans betwixt him and his cruel uncle's ambition.Farewell, Robert of Albany--farewell for ever, thou hard hearted, bloody
man!Enjoy such share of power as the Douglas may permit thee.But seek
not to see my face again, far less to approach my remaining child; for,
that hour thou dost, my guards shall have orders to stab thee down with
their partizans!The Duke of Albany left the presence without attempting further
justification or reply.In the ensuing Parliament, the Duke
of Albany prevailed on that body to declare him innocent of the death
of Rothsay, while, at the same time, he showed his own sense of guilt by
taking out a remission or pardon for the offence.The unhappy and aged
monarch secluded himself in his Castle of Rothsay, in Bute, to mourn
over the son he had lost, and watch with feverish anxiety over the life
of him who remained.As the best step for the youthful James's security,
he sent him to France to receive his education at the court of the
reigning sovereign.But the vessel in which the Prince of Scotland
sailed was taken by an English cruiser, and, although there was a truce
for the moment betwixt the kingdoms, Henry IV ungenerously detained him
a prisoner.This last blow completely broke the heart of the unhappy
King Robert III.Vengeance followed, though with a slow pace, the
treachery and cruelty of his brother.Robert of Albany's own grey hairs
went, indeed, in peace to the grave, and he transferred the regency
which he had so foully acquired to his son Murdoch.But, nineteen years
after the death of the old King, James I returned to Scotland, and
Duke Murdoch of Albany, with his sons, was brought to the scaffold, in
expiation of his father's guilt and his own.The honest heart that's free frae a'
     Intended fraud or guile,
     However Fortune kick the ba',
     Has aye some cause to smile.We now return to the Fair Maid of Perth, who had been sent from the
horrible scene at Falkland by order of the Douglas, to be placed under
the protection of his daughter, the now widowed Duchess of Rothsay.That
lady's temporary residence was a religious house called Campsie, the
ruins of which still occupy a striking situation on the Tay.It arose on
the summit of a precipitous rock, which descends on the princely river,
there rendered peculiarly remarkable by the cataract called Campsie
Linn, where its waters rush tumultuously over a range of basaltic
rock, which intercepts the current, like a dike erected by human hands.Delighted with a site so romantic, the monks of the abbey of Cupar
reared a structure there, dedicated to an obscure saint, named St.Hunnand, and hither they were wont themselves to retire for pleasure or
devotion.It had readily opened its gates to admit the noble lady who
was its present inmate, as the country was under the influence of
the powerful Lord Drummond, the ally of the Douglas.There the Earl's
letters were presented to the Duchess by the leader of the escort which
conducted Catharine and the glee maiden to Campsie.Whatever reason
she might have to complain of Rothsay, his horrible and unexpected end
greatly shocked the noble lady, and she spent the greater part of the
night in indulging her grief and in devotional exercises.On the next morning, which was that of the memorable Palm Sunday, she
ordered Catharine Glover and the minstrel into her presence.The spirits
of both the young women had been much sunk and shaken by the dreadful
scenes in which they had so lately been engaged; and the outward
appearance of the Duchess Marjory was, like that of her father, more
calculated to inspire awe than confidence.She spoke with kindness,
however, though apparently in deep affliction, and learned from them
all which they had to tell concerning the fate of her erring and
inconsiderate husband.She appeared grateful for the efforts which
Catharine and the glee maiden had made, at their own extreme peril, to
save Rothsay from his horrible fate.She invited them to join in her
devotions; and at the hour of dinner gave them her hand to kiss, and
dismissed them to their own refection, assuring both, and Catharine in
particular, of her efficient protection, which should include, she said,
her father's, and be a wall around them both, so long as she herself
lived.They retired from the presence of the widowed Princess, and partook of
a repast with her duennas and ladies, all of whom, amid their profound
sorrow, showed a character of stateliness which chilled the light heart
of the Frenchwoman, and imposed restraint even on the more serious
character of Catharine Glover.The friends, for so we may now term them,
were fain, therefore, to escape from the society of these persons, all
of them born gentlewomen, who thought themselves but ill assorted with
a burgher's daughter and a strolling glee maiden, and saw them with
pleasure go out to walk in the neighbourhood of the convent.A little
garden, with its bushes and fruit trees, advanced on one side of the
convent, so as to skirt the precipice, from which it was only separated
by a parapet built on the ledge of the rock, so low that the eye might
easily measure the depth of the crag, and gaze on the conflicting waters
which foamed, struggled, and chafed over the reef below.The Fair Maiden of Perth and her companion walked slowly on a path that
ran within this parapet, looked at the romantic prospect, and judged
what it must be when the advancing summer should clothe the grove with
leaves.At length the gay
and bold spirit of the glee maiden rose above the circumstances in which
she had been and was now placed."Do the horrors of Falkland, fair May, still weigh down your spirits?Strive to forget them as I do: we cannot tread life's path lightly, if
we shake not from our mantles the raindrops as they fall.""These horrors are not to be forgotten," answered Catharine."Yet my
mind is at present anxious respecting my father's safety; and I cannot
but think how many brave men may be at this instant leaving the world,
even within six miles of us, or little farther.""You mean the combat betwixt sixty champions, of which the Douglas's
equerry told us yesterday?It were a sight for a minstrel to witness.But out upon these womanish eyes of mine--they could never see swords
cross each other without being dazzled.But see--look yonder, May
Catharine--look yonder!That flying messenger certainly brings news of
the battle.""Methinks I should know him who runs so wildly," said Catharine."But if
it be he I think of, some wild thoughts are urging his speed."As she spoke, the runner directed his course to the garden.Louise's
little dog ran to meet him, barking furiously, but came back, to
cower, creep, and growl behind its mistress; for even dumb animals can
distinguish when men are driven on by the furious energy of irresistible
passion, and dread to cross or encounter them in their career.The
fugitive rushed into the garden at the same reckless pace.His head was
bare, his hair dishevelled, his rich acton and all his other vestments
looked as if they had been lately drenched in water.His leathern
buskins were cut and torn, and his feet marked the sod with blood.His
countenance was wild, haggard, and highly excited, or, as the Scottish
phrase expresses it, much "raised."said Catharine, as he advanced, apparently without seeing
what was before him, as hares are said to do when severely pressed by
the greyhounds.But he stopped short when he heard his own name."Conachar," said Catharine, "or rather Eachin MacIan, what means all
this?Have the Clan Quhele sustained a defeat?""I have borne such names as this maiden gives me," said the fugitive,
after a moment's recollection."Yes, I was called Conachar when I was
happy, and Eachin when I was powerful.But now I have no name, and there
is no such clan as thou speak'st of; and thou art a foolish maid to
speak of that which is not to one who has no existence."unfortunate--"

"And why unfortunate, I pray you?""If I am coward
and villain, have not villainy and cowardice command over the elements?Have I not braved the water without its choking me, and trod the firm
earth without its opening to devour me?He will not
harm me; but I fear he will do evil to himself.See how he stares down
on the roaring waterfall!"The glee woman hastened to do as she was ordered, and Conachar's half
frenzied spirit seemed relieved by her absence."Catharine," he said, "now she is gone, I will say I know thee--I know
thy love of peace and hatred of war.But hearken; I have, rather than
strike a blow at my enemy, given up all that a man calls dearest: I have
lost honour, fame, and friends, and such friends!(he placed his hands
before his face).All know my shame; all should see my sorrow.Yes, all
might see, but who would pity it?Catharine, as I ran like a madman down
the strath, man and woman called'shame' on me!The beggar to whom I
flung an alms, that I might purchase one blessing, threw it back in
disgust, and with a curse upon the coward!Each bell that tolled rung
out, 'Shame on the recreant caitiff!'The brute beasts in their lowing
and bleating, the wild winds in their rustling and howling, the hoarse
waters in their dash and roar, cried, 'Out upon the dastard!'The
faithful nine are still pursuing me; they cry with feeble voice, 'Strike
but one blow in our revenge, we all died for you!'"While the unhappy youth thus raved, a rustling was heard in the bushes.he exclaimed, springing upon the parapet, but
with a terrified glance towards the thicket, through which one or two
attendants were stealing, with the purpose of surprising him.But the
instant he saw a human form emerge from the cover of the bushes, he
waved his hands wildly over his head, and shrieking out, "Bas air
Eachin!"plunged down the precipice into the raging cataract beneath.It is needless to say, that aught save thistledown must have been dashed
to pieces in such a fall.But the river was swelled, and the remains of
the unhappy youth were never seen.A varying tradition has assigned more
than one supplement to the history.It is said by one account, that the
young captain of Clan Quhele swam safe to shore, far below the Linns of
Campsie; and that, wandering disconsolately in the deserts of Rannoch,
he met with Father Clement, who had taken up his abode in the wilderness
as a hermit, on the principle of the old Culdees.He converted, it is
said, the heart broken and penitent Conachar, who lived with him in his
cell, sharing his devotion and privations, till death removed them in
succession.Another wilder legend supposes that he was snatched from death by the
daione shie, or fairy folk, and that he continues to wander through wood
and wild, armed like an ancient Highlander, but carrying his sword in
his left hand.Sometimes he
seems about to attack the traveller, but, when resisted with courage,
always flies.These legends are founded on two peculiar points in his
story--his evincing timidity and his committing suicide--both of them
circumstances almost unexampled in the history of a mountain chief.When Simon Glover, having seen his friend Henry duly taken care of in
his own house in Curfew Street, arrived that evening at the Place of
Campsie, he found his daughter extremely ill of a fever, in consequence
of the scenes to which she had lately been a witness, and particularly
the catastrophe of her late playmate.The affection of the glee maiden
rendered her so attentive and careful a nurse, that the glover said it
should not be his fault if she ever touched lute again, save for her own
amusement.It was some time ere Simon ventured to tell his daughter of Henry's late
exploits, and his severe wounds; and he took care to make the most of
the encouraging circumstance, that her faithful lover had refused both
honour and wealth rather than become a professed soldier and follow the
Douglas.Catharine sighed deeply and shook her head at the history of
bloody Palm Sunday on the North Inch.But apparently she had reflected
that men rarely advance in civilisation or refinement beyond the ideas
of their own age, and that a headlong and exuberant courage, like that
of Henry Smith, was, in the iron days in which they lived, preferable to
the deficiency which had led to Conachar's catastrophe.If she had
any doubts on the subject, they were removed in due time by Henry's
protestations, so soon as restored health enabled him to plead his own
cause."I should blush to say, Catharine, that I am even sick of the thoughts
of doing battle.Yonder last field showed carnage enough to glut a
tiger.I am therefore resolved to hang up my broadsword, never to be
drawn more unless against the enemies of Scotland.""And should Scotland call for it," said Catharine, "I will buckle it
round you.""And, Catharine," said the joyful glover, "we will pay largely for soul
masses for those who have fallen by Henry's sword; and that will not
only cure spiritual flaws, but make us friends with the church again.""For that purpose, father," said Catharine, "the hoards of the wretched
Dwining may be applied.He bequeathed them to me; but I think you would
not mix his base blood money with your honest gains?""I would bring the plague into my house as soon," said the resolute
glover.The treasures of the wicked apothecary were distributed accordingly
among the four monasteries; nor was there ever after a breath of
suspicion concerning the orthodoxy of old Simon or his daughter.Henry and Catharine were married within four months after the battle
of the North Inch, and never did the corporations of the glovers and
hammermen trip their sword dance so featly as at the wedding of the
boldest burgess and brightest maiden in Perth.Ten months after, a
gallant infant filled the well spread cradle, and was rocked by Louise
to the tune of--

     Bold and true,
     In bonnet blue.The names of the boy's sponsors are recorded, as "Ane Hie and Michty
Lord, Archibald Erl of Douglas, ane Honorabil and gude Knicht, Schir
Patrick Charteris of Kinfauns, and ane Gracious Princess, Marjory
Dowaire of his Serene Highness David, umquhile Duke of Rothsay."Under such patronage a family rises fast; and several of the most
respected houses in Scotland, but especially in Perthshire, and many
individuals distinguished both in arts and arms, record with pride their
descent from the Gow Chrom and the Fair Maid of Perth.The boys clustered eagerly about the carriage and a lively chat took
place.The Zouaves, some blushing and bashful, others frank and
confident, and all desperately in love already with pretty little
Jessie, related in high glee their adventures--except the celebrated
court martial--and enlarged glowingly upon the all-important subject of
the grand review.Colonel Freddy, of course, played a prominent part in all this, and with
his handsome face, bright eyes, and frank, gentlemanly ways, needed only
those poor lost curls to be a perfect picture of a soldier.He chattered
away with Miss Lucy, the second sister, and obtained her special promise
that she would plead their cause with Mr.Schermerhorn in case the
united petitions of the corps should fail.The young ladies did not know
of Mrs.Schermerhorn's departure, but Freddy and Peter together coaxed
them to come
