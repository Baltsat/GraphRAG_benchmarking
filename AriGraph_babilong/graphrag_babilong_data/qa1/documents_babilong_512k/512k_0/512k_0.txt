On the corner facing the square, and opposite the Luxembourg gate, is
the Taverne du Pantheon.This is the most brilliant cafe and restaurant
of the Quarter, forming a V with its long terrace, at the corner of the
boulevard and the rue Soufflot, at the head of which towers the superb
dome of the Pantheon.[Illustration: (view of Pantheon from Luxembourg gate)]

It is 6 P.M.and the terrace, four rows deep with little round tables,
is rapidly filling.The white-aproned garcons are hurrying about or
squeezing past your table, as they take the various orders."Deux pernod nature, deux!"cries another, and presently the "Omnibus"
in his black apron hurries to your table, holding between his knuckles,
by their necks, half a dozen bottles of different aperitifs, for it is
he who fills your glass.[Illustration: ALONG THE "BOUL' MICHE"]

It is the custom to do most of one's correspondence in these cafes.The
garcon brings you a portfolio containing note-paper, a bottle of violet
ink, an impossible pen that spatters, and a sheet of pink blotting-paper
that does not absorb.With these and your aperitif, the place is yours
as long as you choose to remain.No one will ask you to "move on" or pay
the slightest attention to you.Should you happen to be a cannibal chief from the South Seas, and dine
in a green silk high hat and a necklace of your latest captive's teeth,
you would occasion a passing glance perhaps, but you would not be a
sensation.[Illustration: (hotel sign)]

Celeste would say to Henriette:

"Regarde ca, Henriette!est-il drole, ce sauvage?"And Henriette would reply quite assuringly:

"Eh bien quoi!c'est pas si extraordinaire, il est peut-etre de
Madagascar; il y en a beaucoup a Paris maintenant."There is no phase of character, or eccentricity of dress, that Paris has
not seen.Nor will your waiter polish off the marble top of your table, with the
hope that your ordinary sensibility will suggest another drink.It would
be beneath his professional dignity as a good garcon de cafe.The two
sous you have given him as a pourboire, he is well satisfied with, and
expresses his contentment in a "merci, monsieur, merci," the final
syllable ending in a little hiss, prolonged in proportion to his
satisfaction.After this just formality, you will find him ready to see
the point of a joke or discuss the current topics of the day.He is
intelligent, independent, very polite, but never servile.[Illustration: (woman walking near fountain)]

It is difficult now to find a vacant chair on the long terrace.A group
of students are having a "Pernod," after a long day's work at the
atelier.They finish their absinthe and then, arm in arm, start off to
Madame Poivret's for dinner.It is cheap there; besides, the little
"boite," with its dingy room and sawdust floor, is a favorite haunt of
theirs, and the good old lady, with her credit slate, a friendly refuge
in time of need.At your left sits a girl in bicycle bloomers, yellow-tanned shoes, and
short black socks pulled up snug to her sunburned calves.She has just
ridden in from the Bois de Boulogne, and has scorched half the way back
to meet her "officier" in pale blue.Farther on are four older men, accompanied by a pale, sweet-faced woman
of thirty, her blue-black hair brought in a bandeau over her dainty
ears.She is the model of the gray-haired man on the left, a man of
perhaps fifty, with kindly intelligent eyes and strong, nervous,
expressive hands--hands that know how to model a colossal Greek
war-horse, plunging in battle, or create a nymph scarcely a foot high
out of a lump of clay, so charmingly that the French Government has not
only bought the nymph, but given him a little red ribbon for his pains.[Illustration: (omnibus)]

He is telling the others of a spot he knows in Normandy, where one can
paint--full of quaint farm-houses, with thatched roofs; picturesque
roadsides, rich in foliage; bright waving fields, and cool green
woods, and purling streams; quaint gardens, choked with lavender and
roses and hollyhocks--and all this fair land running to the white sand
of the beach, with the blue sea beyond.He will write to old Pere
Jaqueline that they are all coming--it is just the place in which to
pose a model "en plein air,"--and Suzanne, his model, being a Normande
herself, grows enthusiastic at the thought of going down again to the
sea.Long before she became a Parisienne, and when her beautiful hair
was a tangled shock of curls, she used to go out in the big boats,
with the fisherwomen--barefooted, brown, and happy.She tells them of
those good days, and then they all go into the Taverne to dine, filled
with the idea of the new trip, and dreaming of dinners under the
trees, of "Tripes a la mode de Caen," Normandy cider, and a lot of new
sketches besides.[Illustration: (shop front)]

Already the tables within are well filled.The long room, with its newer
annex, is as brilliant as a jewel box--the walls rich in tiled panels
suggesting the life of the Quarter, the woodwork in gold and light oak,
the big panels of the rich gold ceiling exquisitely painted.At one of the tables two very chic young women are dining with a young
Frenchman, his hair and dress in close imitation of the Duc d'Orleans.A strikingly pretty woman, in a scarlet-spangled gown as red as her
lips, is dining with a well-built, soldierly-looking man in black; they
sit side by side as is the custom here.The woman reminds one of a red lizard--a salamander--her "svelte" body
seemingly boneless in its gown of clinging scales.Her hair is
purple-black and freshly onduled; her skin as white as ivory.She has
the habit of throwing back her small, well-posed head, while under their
delicately penciled lids her gray eyes take in the room at a glance.She is not of the Quarter, but the Taverne du Pantheon is a refuge for
her at times, when she grows tired of Paillard's and Maxim's and her
quarreling retinue."Let them howl on the other bank of the Seine," says this empress of
the half-world to herself, "I dine with Raoul where I please."And now one glittering, red arm with its small, heavily-jeweled hand
glides toward Raoul's open cigarette case, and in withdrawing a
cigarette she presses for a moment his big, strong hand as he holds near
her polished nails the flaming match.[Illustration: ALONG THE SEINE]

Her companion watches her as she smokes and talks--now and then he leans
closer to her, squaring his broad shoulders and bending lower his
strong, determined face, as he listens to her,--half-amused, replying to
her questions leisurely, in short, crisp sentences.Suddenly she stamps
one little foot savagely under the table, and, clenching her jeweled
hands, breathes heavily.She is trembling with rage; the man at her side
hunches his great shoulders, flicks the ashes from his cigarette, looks
at her keenly for a moment, and then smiles.In a moment she is herself
again, almost penitent; this little savage, half Roumanian, half
Russian, has never known what it was to be ruled!She has seen men grow
white when she has stamped her little foot, but this big Raoul, whom she
loves--who once held a garrison with a handful of men--he does not
tremble!she loves him for his devil-me-care indifference--and he enjoys
her temper.But the salamander remembers there are some whom she dominated, until
they groveled like slaves at her feet; even the great Russian nobleman
turned pale when she dictated to him archly and with the voice of an
angel the price of his freedom.he shot himself the next day," mused the salamander.Yes, and even the adamant old banker in Paris, crabbed, stern,
unrelenting to his debtors--shivered in his boots and ended in signing
away half his fortune to her, and moved his family into a permanent
chateau in the country, where he keeps himself busy with his shooting
and his books.*     *     *     *     *

As it grows late, the taverne becomes more and more animated.Every one is talking and having a good time.The room is bewildering in
gay color, the hum of conversation is everywhere, and as there is a
corresponding row of tables across the low, narrow room, friendly
greetings and often conversations are kept up from one side to the
other.The dinner, as it progresses, assumes the air of a big family
party of good bohemians.The French do not bring their misery with them
to the table.To dine is to enjoy oneself to the utmost; in fact the
French people cover their disappointment, sadness, annoyances, great or
petty troubles, under a masque of "blague," and have such an innate
dislike of sympathy or ridicule that they avoid it by turning
everything into "blague."This veneer is misleading, for at heart the French are sad.Not to speak
of their inmost feelings does not, on the other hand, prevent them at
times from being most confidential.Often, the merest exchange of
courtesies between those sharing the same compartment in a train, or a
seat on a "bus," seems to be a sufficient introduction for your neighbor
to tell you where he comes from, where he is going, whether he is
married or single, whom his daughter married, and what regiment his son
is in.These little confidences often end in his offering you half his
bottle of wine and extending to you his cigarettes.[Illustration: LES BEAUX MAQUEREAUX]

If you have finished dinner, you go out on the terrace for your coffee.The fakirs are passing up and down in front, selling their wares--little
rabbits, wonderfully lifelike, that can jump along your table and sit on
their hind legs, and wag their ears; toy snakes; small leaden pigs for
good luck; and novelties of every description.Here one sees women with
baskets of ecrivisse boiled scarlet; an acrobat tumbles on the
pavement, and two men and a girl, as a marine, a soldier, and a
vivandiere, in silvered faces and suits, pose in melodramatic attitudes.The vivandiere is rescued alternately from a speedy death by the marine
and the soldier.Presently a little old woman approaches, shriveled and smiling, in her
faded furbelows now in rags.She sings in a piping voice and executes
between the verses a tottering pas seul, her eyes ever smiling, as if
she still saw over the glare of the footlights, in the haze beyond, the
vast audience of by-gone days; smiling as if she still heard the big
orchestra and saw the leader with his vibrant baton, watching her every
movement.She is over seventy now, and was once a premier danseuse at
the opera.But you have not seen all of the Taverne du Pantheon yet.There is an
"American Bar" downstairs; at least, so the sign reads at the top of a
narrow stairway leading to a small, tavern-like room, with a sawdust
floor, heavy deal tables, and wooden stools.In front of the bar are
high stools that one climbs up on and has a lukewarm whisky soda, next
to Yvonne and Marcelle, who are both singing the latest catch of the day
at the top of their lungs, until they are howled at to keep still or are
lifted bodily off their high stools by the big fellow in the "type" hat,
who has just come in.[Illustration: MOTHER AND DAUGHTER]

Before a long table at one end of the room is the crowd of American
students singing in a chorus.The table is full now, for many have come
from dinners at other cafes to join them.At one end, and acting as
interlocutor for this impromptu minstrel show, presides one of the
best fellows in the world.He rises solemnly, his genial round face
wreathed in a subtle smile, and announces that he will sing, by earnest
request, that popular ballad, "'Twas Summer and the Little Birds were
Singing in the Trees."There are some especially fine "barber chords" in this popular ditty,
and the words are so touching that it is repeated over and over again.Then it is sung softly like the farmhand quartettes do in the rural
melodrama outside the old homestead in harvest time.I tell you it's
a truly rural octette.Listen to that exhibition bass voice of Jimmy
Sands and that wandering tenor of Tommy Whiteing, and as the last chord
dies away (over the fields presumably) a shout goes up:

"How's that?""Out of sight," comes the general verdict from the crowd, and bang go a
dozen beer glasses in unison on the heavy table."Oh, que c'est beau!"cries Mimi, leading the successful chorus in a new
vocal number with Edmond's walking-stick; but this time it is a French
song and the whole room is singing it, including our old friend,
Monsieur Frank, the barkeeper, who is mixing one of his famous
concoctions which are never twice quite alike, but are better than if
they were.The harmonic beauties of "'Twas Summer and the Little Birds were Singing
in the Trees" are still inexhausted, but it sadly needs a piano
accompaniment--with this it would be perfect; and so the whole crowd,
including Yvonne, and Celeste, and Marcelle, and the two Frenchmen, and
the girl in the bicycle clothes, start for Jack Thompson's studio in the
rue des Fourneaux, where there is a piano that, even if the candles in
the little Louis XVI brackets do burn low and spill down the keys, and
the punch rusts the strings, it will still retain that beautiful, rich
tone that every French upright, at seven francs a month, possesses.[Illustration: (Bullier)]

CHAPTER III

THE "BAL BULLIER"


There are all types of "bals" in Paris.Over in Montmartre, on the Place
Blanche, is the well-known "Moulin Rouge," a place suggestive, to those
who have never seen it, of the quintessence of Parisian devil-me-care
gaiety.You expect it to be like those clever pen-and-ink drawings of
Grevin's, of the old Jardin Mabille in its palmiest days, brilliant with
lights and beautiful women extravagantly gowned and bejeweled.You
expect to see Frenchmen, too, in pot-hats, crowding in a circle about
Fifine, who is dancing some mad can-can, half hidden in a swirl of point
lace, her small, polished boots alternately poised above her dainty
head.And when she has finished, you expect her to be carried off to
supper at the Maison Doree by the big, fierce-looking Russian who has
been watching her, and whose victoria, with its spanking team--black and
glossy as satin--champing their silver bits outside, awaiting her
pleasure.But in all these anticipations you will be disappointed, for the famous
Jardin Mabille is no more, and the ground where it once stood in the
Champs Elysees is now built up with private residences.Fifine is gone,
too--years ago--and most of the old gentlemen in pot-hats who used to
watch her are buried or about to be.Few Frenchmen ever go to the
"Moulin Rouge," but every American does on his first night in Paris, and
emerges with enough cab fare to return him to his hotel, where he
arrives with the positive conviction that the red mill, with its slowly
revolving sails, lurid in crimson lights, was constructed especially for
him.He remembers, too, his first impressions of Paris that very morning
as his train rolled into the Gare St.His aunt could wait until
to-morrow to see the tomb of Napoleon, but he would see the "Moulin
Rouge" first, and to be in ample time ordered dinner early in his
expensive, morgue-like hotel.I remember once, a few hours after my arrival in Paris, walking up the
long hill to the Place Blanche at 2 P.M., under a blazing July sun, to
see if they did not give a matinee at the "Moulin Rouge."The place was
closed, it is needless to say, and the policeman I found pacing his beat
outside, when I asked him what day they gave a matinee, put his thumbs
in his sword belt, looked at me quizzically for a moment, and then
roared.The "Moulin Rouge" is in full blast every night; in the day-time
it is being aired.Farther up in Montmartre, up a steep, cobbly hill, past quaint little
shops and cafes, the hill becoming so steep that your cab horse
finally refuses to climb further, and you get out and walk up to the
"Moulin de la Galette."You find it a far different type of ball from
the "Moulin Rouge," for it is not made for the stranger, and its
clientele is composed of the rougher element of that quarter.[Illustration: (street scene)]

A few years ago the "Galette" was not the safest of places for a
stranger to go to alone.Since then, however, this ancient granary and
mill, that has served as a ball-room for so many years, has undergone a
radical change in management; but it is still a cliquey place, full of a
lot of habitues who regard a stranger as an intruder.Should you by
accident step on Marcelle's dress or jostle her villainous-looking
escort, you will be apt to get into a row, beginning with a mode of
attack you are possibly ignorant of, for these "maquereaux" fight with
their feet, having developed this "manly art" of self-defense to a point
of dexterity more to be evaded than admired.And while Marcelle's
escort, with a swinging kick, smashes your nose with his heel, his pals
will take the opportunity to kick you in the back.So, if you go to the "Galette," go with a Parisian or some of the
students of the Quarter; but if you must go alone--keep your eyes on the
band.It is a good band, too, and its chef d'orchestre, besides being a
clever musical director, is a popular composer as well.Go out from the ball-room into the tiny garden and up the ladder-like
stairs to the rock above, crowned with the old windmill, and look over
the iron railing.Far below you, swimming in a faint mist under the
summer stars, all Paris lies glittering at your feet.*     *     *     *     *

You will find the "Bal Bullier" of the Latin Quarter far different from
the "bals" of Montmartre.It forms, with its "grand fete" on Thursday
nights, a sort of social event of the week in this Quarter of Bohemians,
just as the Friday afternoon promenade does in the Luxembourg garden.If you dine at the Taverne du Pantheon on a Thursday night you will find
that the taverne is half deserted by 10 o'clock, and that every one is
leaving and walking up the "Boul' Miche" toward the "Bullier."Follow
them, and as you reach the place l'Observatoire, and turn a sharp corner
to the left, you will see the facade of this famous ball, illumined by a
sizzling blue electric light over the entrance.The facade, with its colored bas-reliefs of students and grisettes,
reminds one of the proscenium of a toy theater.Back of this shallow
wall bristle the tops of the trees in the garden adjoining the big
ball-room, both of which are below the level of the street and are
reached by a broad wooden stairway.The "Bal Bullier" was founded in 1847; previous to this there existed
the "Closerie des Lilas" on the Boulevard Montparnasse.You pass along
with the line of waiting poets and artists, buy a green ticket for two
francs at the little cubby-hole of a box-office, are divested of your
stick by one of half a dozen white-capped matrons at the vestiaire, hand
your ticket to an elderly gentleman in a silk hat and funereal clothes,
at the top of the stairway sentineled by a guard of two soldiers, and
the next instant you see the ball in full swing below you.[Illustration: (portrait of man)]

There is nothing disappointing about the "Bal Bullier."It is all you
expected it to be, and more, too.Below you is a veritable whirlpool of
girls and students--a vast sea of heads, and a dazzling display of
colors and lights and animation.Little shrieks and screams fill your
ears, as the orchestra crashes into the last page of a galop, quickening
the pace until Yvonne's little feet slip and her cheeks glow, and her
eyes grow bright, and half her pretty golden hair gets smashed over her
impudent little nose.Then the galop is brought up with a quick finish.comes from every quarter of the big room, and
the conductor, with his traditional good-nature, begins again.He knows
it is wiser to humor them, and off they go again, still faster, until
all are out of breath and rush into the garden for a breath of cool air
and a "citron glace."And what a pretty garden it is!--full of beautiful trees and dotted with
round iron tables, and laid out in white gravel walks, the garden
sloping gently back to a fountain, and a grotto and an artificial
cascade all in one, with a figure of Venus in the center, over which the
water splashes and trickles.There is a green lattice proscenium, too,
surrounding the fountain, illuminated with colored lights and outlined
in tiny flames of gas, and grotto-like alcoves circling the garden, each
with a table and room for two.The ball-room from the garden presents a
brilliant contrast, as one looks down upon it from under the trees.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

But the orchestra has given its signal--a short bugle call announcing a
quadrille; and those in the garden are running down into the ball-room
to hunt up their partners.The "Bullier" orchestra will interest you; they play with a snap and
fire and a tempo that is irresistible.They have played together so long
that they have become known as the best of all the bal orchestras.The leader, too, is interesting--tall and gaunt, with wild, deep-sunken
eyes resembling those of an old eagle.Now and then he turns his head
slowly as he leads, and rests these keen, penetrating orbs on the sea of
dancers below him.Then, with baton raised above his head, he brings his
orchestra into the wild finale of the quadrille--piccolos and clarinets,
cymbals, bass viols, and violins--all in one mad race to the end, but so
well trained that not a note is lost in the scramble--and they finish
under the wire to a man, amid cheers from Mimi and Celeste and "encores"
and "bis's" from every one else who has breath enough left to shout
with.[Illustration: A TYPE OF THE QUARTER
By Helleu.--Estampe Moderne]

Often after an annual dinner of one of the ateliers, the entire body of
students will march into the "Bullier," three hundred strong, and take a
good-natured possession of the place.There have been some serious
demonstrations in the Quarter by the students, who can form a small army
when combined.But as a rule you will find them a good-natured lot of
fellows, who are out for all the humor and fun they can create at the
least expense.But in June, 1893, a serious demonstration by the students occurred, for
these students can fight as well as dance.Senator Beranger, having
read one morning in the "Courrier Francais" an account of the revelry
and nudity of several of the best-known models of the Quarter at the
"Quat'z' Arts" ball, brought a charge against the organizers of the
ball, and several of the models, whose beauty unadorned had made them
conspicuous on this most festive occasion.At the ensuing trial, several
celebrated beauties and idols of the Latin Quarter were convicted and
sentenced to a short term of imprisonment, and fined a hundred francs
each.These sentences were, however, remitted, but the majority of the
students would not have it thus, and wanted further satisfaction.A mass
meeting was held by them in the Place de la Sorbonne.The police were in
force there to stop any disturbance, and up to 10 o'clock at night the
crowd was held in control.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

It was a warm June night, and every student in the Quarter was keyed to
a high state of excitement.Finally a great crowd of students formed in
front of the Cafe d'Harcourt, opposite the Sorbonne; things were at
fever heat; the police became rough; and in the row that ensued,
somebody hurled one of the heavy stone match-safes from a cafe table at
one of the policemen, who in his excitement picked it up and hurled it
back into the crowd.It struck and injured fatally an innocent outsider,
who was taken to the Charity Hospital, in the rue Jacob, and died there.On the following Monday another mass meeting of students was held in the
Place de la Sorbonne, who, after the meeting, formed in a body and
marched to the Chamber of Deputies, crying: "Conspuez Dupuy," who was
then president of the Chamber.A number of deputies came out on the
portico and the terrace, and smilingly reviewed the demonstration, while
the students hurled their anathemas at them, the leaders and men in the
front rank of this howling mob trying to climb over the high railing in
front of the terrace, and shouting that the police were responsible for
the death of one of their comrades.The Government, fearing further trouble and wishing to avoid any
disturbance on the day of the funeral of the victim of the riot in the
Place Sorbonne, deceived the public as to the hour when it would occur.This exasperated the students so that they began one of those
demonstrations for which Paris is famous.the next day the
Quartier Latin was in a state of siege--these poets and painters and
sculptors and musicians tore up the rue Jacob and constructed barricades
near the hospital where their comrade had died.They tore up the rue
Bonaparte, too, at the Place St.Germain des Pres, and built barricades,
composed of overturned omnibuses and tramcars and newspaper booths.They
smashed windows and everything else in sight, to get even with the
Government and the smiling deputies and the murderous police--and then
the troops came, and the affair took a different turn.In three days
thirty thousand troops were in Paris--principally cavalry, many of the
regiments coming from as far away as the center of France.[Illustration: ECOLE DES BEAUX ARTS]

With these and the police and the Garde Republicaine against them, the
students melted away like a handful of snow in the sun; but the
demonstrations continued spasmodically for two or three days longer, and
the little crooked streets, like the rue du Four, were kept clear by the
cavalry trotting abreast--in and out and dodging around corners--their
black horse-tail plumes waving and helmets shining.It is sufficient to
say that the vast army of artists and poets were routed to a man and
driven back into the more peaceful atmosphere of their studios.But the "Bullier" is closing and the crowd is pouring out into the cool
air.I catch a glimpse of Yvonne with six students all in one fiacre,
but Yvonne has been given the most comfortable place.They have put her
in the hood, and the next instant they are rattling away to the Pantheon
for supper.If you walk down with the rest, you will pass dozens of jolly groups
singing and romping and dancing along down the "Boul' Miche" to the
taverne, for a bock and some ecrivisse.With youth, good humor, and a
"louis," all the world seems gay!CHAPTER IV

BAL DES QUAT'Z' ARTS


Of all the balls in Paris, the annual "Bal des Quat'z' Arts" stands
unique.This costume ball is given every year, in the spring, by the
students of the different ateliers, each atelier vying with the others
in creation of the various floats and corteges, and in the artistic
effect and historical correctness of the costumes.The first "Quat'z' Arts" ball was given in 1892.It was a primitive
affair, compared with the later ones, but it was a success, and
immediately the "Quat'z' Arts" Ball was put into the hands of clever
organizers, and became a studied event in all its artistic sense.Months
are spent in the creation of spectacles and in the costuming of students
and models.Prizes are given for the most successful organizations, and
a jury composed of painters and sculptors passes upon your costume as
you enter the ball, and if you do not come up to their artistic
standard you are unceremoniously turned away.Students who have been
successful in getting into the "Quat'z' Arts" for years often fail to
pass into this bewildering display of beauty and brains, owing to their
costume not possessing enough artistic originality or merit to pass the
jury.[Illustration: (coiffeur sign)]

It is, of course, a difficult matter for one who is not an enrolled
member of one of the great ateliers of painting, architecture, or
sculpture to get into the "Quat'z' Arts," and even after one's ticket is
assured, you may fail to pass the jury.Imagine this ball, with its procession of moving tableaux.A huge float
comes along, depicting the stone age and the primitive man, every detail
carefully studied from the museums.Another represents the last day of
Babylon.One sees a nude captive, her golden hair and white flesh in
contrast with the black velvet litter on which she is bound, being
carried by a dozen stalwart blackamoors, followed by camels bearing nude
slaves and the spoils of a captured city.[Illustration: (photograph of woman)]

As the ball continues until daylight, it resembles a bacchanalian fete
in the days of the Romans.But all through it, one is impressed by its
artistic completeness, its studied splendor, and permissible license, so
long as a costume (or the lack of it) produces an artistic result.One
sees the mise en scene of a barbaric court produced by the architects of
an atelier, all the various details constructed from carefully studied
sketches, with maybe a triumphal throne of some barbaric king, with his
slaves, the whole costumed and done in a studied magnificence that
takes one's breath away.Again an atelier of painters may reproduce the
frieze of the Parthenon in color; another a float or a decoration,
suggesting the works of their master.The room becomes a thing of splendor, for it is as gorgeous a spectacle
as the cleverest of the painters, sculptors, and architects can make it,
and is the result of careful study--and all for the love of it!--for the
great "Quat'z' Arts" ball is an event looked forward to for months.Special instructions are issued to the different ateliers while the ball
is in preparation, and the following one is a translation in part from
the notice issued before the great ball of '99.As this is a special and
private notice to the atelier, its contents may be interesting:


                                      BAL DES QUAT'Z' ARTS,
                                    Moulin Rouge, 21 April, 1899.The card of admission is absolutely personal, to be taken by the
     committee before the opening of the ball.[Illustration: (admission card)]

     The committee will be masked, and comrades without their personal
     card will be refused at the door.The cards must carry the name and
     quality of the artist, and bear the stamp of his atelier.The soldier--the dress suit,
     black or in color--the monk--the blouse--the domino--kitchen
     boy--loafer--bicyclist, and other nauseous types, are absolutely
     prohibited.Should the weather be bad, comrades are asked to wait in their
     carriages, as the committee in control cannot, under any pretext,
     neglect guarding the artistic effect of the ball during any
     confusion that might ensue.A great "feed" will take place in the grand hall; the buffet will
     serve as usual individual suppers and baskets for two persons.The committee wish especially to bring the attention of their
     comrades to the question of women, whose cards of admission
     must be delivered as soon as possible, so as to enlarge their
     attendance--always insufficient.Prizes (champagne) will be distributed to the ateliers who may
     distinguish themselves by the artistic merit and beauty of their
     female display.[Illustration: (photograph of woman)]

     All the women who compete for these prizes will be assembled on
     the grand staircase before the orchestra.The nude, as always, is
     PROHIBITED!?!The question of music at the head of the procession is of the
     greatest importance, and those comrades who are musical will please
     give their names to the delegates of the ateliers.Your good-will
     in this line is asked for--any great worthless capacity in this
     line will do, as they always play the same tune, "Les Pompiers!"For days before the "Quat'z' Arts" ball, all is excitement among the
students, who do as little work as possible and rest themselves for the
great event.The favorite wit of the different ateliers is given the
task of painting the banner of the atelier, which is carried at the head
of the several corteges.One of these, in Bouguereau's atelier, depicted
their master caricatured as a cupid.The boys once constructed an elephant with oriental trappings--an
elephant that could wag his ears and lift his trunk and snort--and after
the two fellows who formed respectfully the front and hind legs of this
knowing beast had practised sufficiently to proceed with him safely, at
the head of a cortege of slave girls, nautch dancers, and manacled
captives, the big beast created a success in the procession at the
"Quat'z' Arts" ball.[Illustration: (portrait of man)]

After the ball, in the gray morning light, they marched it back to the
atelier, where it remained for some weeks, finally becoming such a
nuisance, kicking around the atelier and getting in everybody's way,
that the boys agreed to give it to the first junk-man that came around.But as no junk-man came, and as no one could be found to care for its
now sadly battered hulk, its good riddance became a problem.At last the two, who had sweltered in its dusty frame that eventful
night of the "Quat'z' Arts," hit upon an idea.They marched it one day
up the Boulevard St.Germain to the Cafe des deux Magots, followed by a
crowd of people, who, when it reached the cafe, assembled around it,
every one asking what it was for--or rather what it was?--for the beast
had by now lost much of the resemblance of its former self.When half
the street became blocked with the crowd, the two wise gentlemen crawled
out of its fore and aft, and quickly mingled, unnoticed, with the
bystanders.Then they disappeared in the crowd, leaving the elephant
standing in the middle of the street.Those who had been expecting
something to happen--a circus or the rest of the parade to come
along--stood around for a while, and then the police, realizing that
they had an elephant on their hands, carted the thing away, swearing
meanwhile at the atelier and every one connected with it.The cafes near the Odeon, just before the beginning of the ball, are
filled with students in costume; gladiators hobnob at the tables with
savages in scanty attire--Roman soldiers and students, in the garb of
the ancients, strut about or chat in groups, while the uninvited
grisettes and models, who have not received invitations from the
committee, implore them for tickets.Tickets are not transferable, and should one present himself at the
entrance of the ball with another fellow's ticket, he would run small
chance of entering.The student answers, while the jury glance at his makeup.cries the jury, and you pass in to the ball.But if you are unknown they will say simply, "Connais-pas!and you pass down a long covered alley--confident, if you are a
"nouveau," that it leads into the ball-room--until you suddenly find
yourself in the street, where your ticket is torn up and all hope of
entering is gone.It is hopeless to attempt to describe the hours until morning of this
annual artistic orgy.As the morning light comes in through the
windows, it is strange to see the effect of diffused daylight,
electricity, and gas--the bluish light of early morning reflected on the
flesh tones--upon nearly three thousand girls and students in costumes
one might expect to see in a bacchanalian feast, just before the fall of
Rome.Now they form a huge circle, the front row sitting on the floor,
the second row squatting, the third seated in chairs, the fourth
standing, so that all can see the dancing that begins in the morning
hours--the wild impromptu dancing of the moment.A famous beauty, her
black hair bound in a golden fillet with a circle wrought in silver and
studded with Oriental turquoises clasping her superb torso, throws her
sandals to the crowd and begins an Oriental dance--a thing of grace and
beauty--fired with the intensity of the innate nature of this
beautifully modeled daughter of Bohemia.As the dance ends, there is a cry of delight from the great circle of
barbarians."Long live the Quat'z' Arts!"they cry, amid cheers for the
dancer.The ball closes about seven in the morning, when the long procession
forms to return to the Latin Quarter, some marching, other students and
girls in cabs and on top of them, many of the girls riding the horses.Down they come from the "Moulin Rouge," shouting, singing, and yelling.Heads are thrust out of windows, and a volley of badinage passes between
the fantastic procession and those who have heard them coming.Finally the great open court of the Louvre is reached--here a halt is
made and a general romp occurs.A girl and a type climb one of the
tall lamp-posts and prepare to do a mid-air balancing act, when
rescued by the others.At last, at the end of all this horse-play, the
march is resumed over the Pont du Carrousel and so on, cheered now by
those going to work, until the Odeon is reached.Here the odd
procession disbands; some go to their favorite cafes where the
festivities are continued--some to sleep in their costumes or what
remains of them, wherever fortune lands them--others to studios, where
the gaiety is often kept up for days.but life is not all "couleur de rose" in this true Bohemia."One day," says little Marguerite (she who lives in the rue Monge), "one
eats and the next day one doesn't.It is always like that, is it not,
monsieur?--and it costs so much to live, and so you see, monsieur, life
is always a fight."And Marguerite's brown eyes swim a little and her pretty mouth closes
firmly."I do not know, monsieur," she replies quietly; "I have not seen him in
ten days--the atelier is closed--I have been there every day, expecting
to find him--he left no word with his concierge.I have been to his cafe
too, but no one has seen him--you see, monsieur, Paul does not love me!"I recall an incident that I chanced to see in passing the little shop
where Marguerite works, that only confirms the truth of her realization.Paul had taken Marguerite back to the little shop, after their dejeuner
together, and, as I passed, he stopped at the door with her, kissed her
on both cheeks, and left her; but before they had gone a dozen paces,
they ran back to embrace again.This occurred four times, until Paul and
Marguerite finally parted.And, as he watched her little heels disappear
up the wooden stairs to her work-room above, Paul blew a kiss to the
pretty milliner at the window next door, and, taking a long whiff of his
cigarette, sauntered off in the direction of his atelier whistling.[Illustration: A MORNING'S WORK]

It is ideal, this student life with its student loves of four years, but
is it right to many an honest little comrade, who seldom knows an hour
when she is away from her ami?who has suffered and starved and slaved
with him through years of days of good and bad luck--who has encouraged
him in his work, nursed him when ill, and made a thousand golden hours
in this poet's or painter's life so completely happy, that he looks back
on them in later life as never-to-be-forgotten?He remembers the good
dinners at the little restaurant near his studio, where they dined among
the old crowd.There were Lavaud the sculptor and Francine, with the
figure of a goddess; Moreau, who played the cello at the opera; little
Louise Dumont, who posed at Julian's, and old Jacquemart, the very soul
of good fellowship, who would set them roaring with his inimitable
humor.What good dinners they were!--and how long they sat over their coffee
and cigarettes under the trees in front of this little restaurant--often
ten and twelve at a time, until more tables had to be pushed together
for others of their good friends, who in passing would be hailed to join
them.And how Marguerite used to sing all through dinner and how they
would all sing, until it grew so late and so dark that they had to puff
their cigarettes aglow over their plates, and yell to Madame Giraud for
a light!And how the old lady would bustle out with the little oil lamp,
placing it in the center of the long table amid the forest of vin
ordinaires, with a "Voila, mes enfants!"and a cheery word for all these
good boys and girls, whom she regarded quite as her own children.It seemed to them then that there would never be anything else but
dinners at Madame Giraud's for as many years as they pleased, for no one
ever thought of living out one's days, except in this good Bohemia of
Paris.They could not imagine that old Jacquemart would ever die, or
that La Belle Louise would grow old, and go back to Marseilles, to live
with her dried-up old aunt, who sold garlic and bad cheese in a little
box of a shop, up a crooked street!Or that Francine would marry Martin,
the painter, and that the two would bury themselves in an adorable
little spot in Brittany, where they now live in a thatched farm-house,
full of Martin's pictures, and have a vegetable garden of their own--and
a cow--and some children![Illustration: A STUDIO DEJEUNER]

And those memorable dinners in the old studio back of the Gare
Montparnasse!when paints and easels were pushed aside, and the table
spread, and the piano rolled up beside it.There was the buying of the
chicken, and the salad that Francine would smother in a dressing into
which she would put a dozen different things--herbs and spices and tiny
white onions!And what a jolly crowd came to these impromptu feasts!How they danced and sang until the gray
morning light would creep in through the big skylight, when all these
good bohemians would tiptoe down the waxed stairs, and slip past the
different ateliers for fear of waking those painters who might be
asleep--a thought that never occurred to them until broad daylight, and
the door had been opened, after hours of pandemonium and music and
noise!In a little hotel near the Odeon, there lived a family of just such
bohemians--six struggling poets, each with an imagination and a love of
good wine and good dinners and good times that left them continually in
a state of bankruptcy!As they really never had any money--none that
ever lasted for more than two days and two nights at the utmost, their
good landlord seldom saw a sou in return for his hospitable roof, which
had sheltered these six great minds who wrote of the moon, and of fate,
and fortune, and love.For days they would dream and starve and write.Then followed an auction
sale of the total collection of verses, hawked about anywhere and
everywhere among the editeurs, like a crop of patiently grown fruit.Having sold it, literally by the yard, they would all saunter up the
"Boul' Miche," and forget their past misery, in feasting, to their
hearts' content, on the good things of life.On days like these, you
would see them passing, their black-brimmed hats adjusted jauntily over
their poetic locks--their eyes beaming with that exquisite sense of
feeling suddenly rich, that those who live for art's sake know!The
keenest of pleasures lie in sudden contrasts, and to these six poetic,
impractical Bohemians, thus suddenly raised from the slough of despond
to a state where they no longer trod with mortals--their cup of
happiness was full and spilling over.They must not only have a good
time, but so must every one around them.With their great riches, they
would make the world gay as long as it lasted, for when it was over they
knew how sad life would be.For a while--then they would scratch
away--and have another auction![Illustration: DAYLIGHT]

Unlike another good fellow, a painter whom I once knew, who periodically
found himself without a sou, and who would take himself, in despair, to
his lodgings, make his will, leaving most of his immortal works to his
English aunt, go to bed, and calmly await death!In a fortunate space of
time his friends, who had been hunting for him all over the Quarter,
would find him at last and rescue him from his chosen tomb; or his good
aunt, fearing he was ill, would send a draft!Then life would, to this
impractical philosopher, again become worth living.He would dispatch a
"petit bleu" to Marcelle; and the two would meet at the Cafe Cluny, and
dine at La Perruse on filet de sole au vin blanc, and a bottle of Haut
Barsac--the bottle all cobwebs and cradled in its basket--the garcon, as
he poured its golden contents, holding his breath meanwhile lest he
disturb its long slumber.There are wines that stir the soul, and this was one of them--clear as a
topaz and warming as the noonday sun--the same warmth that had given it
birth on its hillside in Bordeaux, as far back as '82.It warmed the
heart of Marcelle, too, and made her cheeks glow and her eyes
sparkle--and added a rosier color to her lips.It made her talk--clearly
and frankly, with a full and a happy heart, so that she confessed her
love for this "bon garcon" of a painter, and her supreme admiration for
his work and the financial success he had made with his art.All of
which this genial son of Bohemia drank in with a feeling of pride, and
he would swell out his chest and curl the ends of his long mustache
upwards, and sigh like a man burdened with money, and secure in his
ability and success, and with a peaceful outlook into the future--and
the fact that Marcelle loved him of all men!They would linger long over
their coffee and cigarettes, and then the two would stroll out under the
stars and along the quai, and watch the little Seine boats crossing and
recrossing, like fireflies, and the lights along the Pont Neuf reflected
deep down like parti-colored ribbons in the black water.[Illustration: (pair of high heeled shoes)]




CHAPTER V

"A DEJEUNER AT LAVENUE'S"


If you should chance to breakfast at "Lavenue's," or, as it is called,
the "Hotel de France et Bretagne," for years famous as a rendezvous of
men celebrated in art and letters, you will be impressed first with the
simplicity of the three little rooms forming the popular side of this
restaurant, and secondly with the distinguished appearance of its
clientele.[Illustration: MADEMOISELLE FANNY AND HER STAFF]

As you enter the front room, you pass good Mademoiselle Fanny at the
desk, a cheery, white-capped, genial old lady, who has sat behind that
desk for forty years, and has seen many a "bon garcon" struggle up the
ladder of fame--from the days when he was a student at the Beaux-Arts,
until his name became known the world over.It has long been a
favorite restaurant with men like Rodin, the sculptor--and Colin, the
painter--and the late Falguiere--and Jean Paul Laurens and Bonnat,
and dozens of others equally celebrated--and with our own men, like
Whistler and Sargent and Harrison, and St.These three plain little rooms are totally different from the "other
side," as it is called, of the Maison Lavenue.Here one finds quite a
gorgeous cafe, with a pretty garden in the rear, and another
room--opening into the garden--done in delicate green lattice and
mirrors.This side is far more expensive to dine in than the side with
the three plain little rooms, and the gentlemen with little red
ribbons in their buttonholes; but as the same good cook dispenses from
the single big kitchen, which serves for the dear and the cheap side
the same good things to eat at just half the price, the reason for the
popularity of the "cheap side" among the crowd who come here daily is
evident.[Illustration: RODIN]

It is a quiet, restful place, this Maison Lavenue, and the best place I
know in which to dine or breakfast from day to day.There is an air of
intime and cosiness about Lavenue's that makes one always wish to
return.[Illustration: (group of men dining)]

You will see a family of rich bourgeois enter, just in from the country,
for the Montparnasse station is opposite.The fat, sunburned mama, and
the equally rotund and genial farmer-papa, and the pretty daughter, and
the newly married son and his demure wife, and the two younger
children--and all talking and laughing over a good dinner with
champagne, and many toasts to the young couple--and to mama and papa,
and little Josephine--with ices, and fruit, and coffee, and liqueur to
follow.All these you will see at Lavenue's on the "cheap side"--and the
beautiful model, too, who poses for Courbel, who is breakfasting with
one of the jeunesse of Paris.dine in the front
room with the rest, and jump up now and then to wait on madame and
monsieur.It is a very democratic little place, this popular side of the house of
M. Lavenue, founded in 1854.And there is a jolly old painter who dines there, who is also an
excellent musician, with an ear for rhythm so sensitive that he could
never go to sleep unless the clock in his studio ticked in regular time,
and at last was obliged to give up his favorite atelier, with its
picturesque garden----

"For two reasons, monsieur," he explained to me excitedly; "a little
girl on the floor below me played a polka--the same polka half the
day--always forgetting to put in the top note; and the fellow over me
whistled it the rest of the day and put in the top note false; and so I
moved to the rue St.Peres, where one only hears, within the cool
court-yard, the distant hum of the busy city.The roar of Paris, so full
of chords and melody!Listen to it sometimes, monsieur, and you will
hear a symphony!"[Illustration: "LA FILLE DE LA BLANCHISSEUSE"
By Bellanger.--Estampe Moderne]

And Mademoiselle Fanny will tell you of the famous men she has known for
years, and how she has found the most celebrated of them simple in their
tastes, and free from ostentation--"in fact it is always so, is it not,
with les hommes celebres?C'est toujours comme ca, monsieur, toujours!"and mentions one who has grown gray in the service of art and can count
his decorations from half a dozen governments.Madame will wax
enthusiastic--her face wreathed in smiles.he is a bon garcon; he
always eats with the rest, for three or four francs, never more!He is
so amiable, and, you know, he is very celebrated and very rich"; and
madame will not only tell you his entire history, but about his
work--the beauty of his wife and how "aimables" his children are.Mademoiselle Fanny knows them all.But the men who come here to lunch are not idlers; they come in, many of
them, fresh from a hard morning's work in the studio.The tall sculptor
opposite you has been at work, since his morning coffee, on a group for
the government; another, bare-armed and in his flannel shirt, has been
building up masses of clay, punching and modeling, and scraping away,
all the morning, until he produces, in the rough, the body of a
giantess, a huge caryatide that is destined, for the rest of her
existence, to hold upon her broad shoulders part of the facade of an
American building.The "giantess" in the flesh is lunching with him--a
Juno-like woman of perhaps twenty-five, with a superb head well poised,
her figure firm and erect.You will find her exceedingly interesting,
quiet, and refined, and with a knowledge of things in general that will
surprise you, until you discover she has, in her life as a model, been
thrown daily in conversation with men of genius, and has acquired a
smattering of the knowledge of many things--of art and literature--of
the theater and its playwrights--plunging now and then into medicine and
law and poetry--all these things she has picked up in the studios, in
the cafes, in the course of her Bohemian life.This "vernis," as the
French call it, one finds constantly among the women here, for their
days are passed among men of intelligence and ability, whose lives and
energy are surrounded and encouraged by an atmosphere of art.In an hour, the sculptor and his Juno-like model will stroll back to the
studio, where work will be resumed as long as the light lasts.[Illustration: A TRUE TYPE]

The painter breakfasting at the next table is hard at work on a
decorative panel for a ceiling.It is already laid out and squared up,
from careful pencil drawings.Two young architects are working for him,
laying out the architectural balustrade, through which one, a month
later, looks up at the allegorical figures painted against the dome of
the blue heavens, as a background.And so the painter swallows his eggs,
mayonnaise, and demi of beer, at a gulp, for he has a model coming at
two, and he must finish this ceiling on time, and ship it, by a fast
liner, to a millionaire, who has built a vault-like structure on the
Hudson, with iron dogs on the lawn.Here this beautiful panel will be
unrolled and installed in the dome of the hard-wood billiard-room, where
its rich, mellow scheme of color will count as naught; and the cupids
and the flesh-tones of the chic little model, who came at two, will
appear jaundiced; and Aunt Maria and Uncle John, and the twins from
Ithaca, will come in after the family Sunday dinner of roast beef and
potatoes and rice pudding and ice-water, and look up into the dome and
agree "it's grand."But the painter does not care, for he has locked up
his studio, and taken his twenty thousand francs and the model--who came
at two--with him to Trouville.At night you will find a typical crowd of Bohemians at the Closerie des
Lilas, where they sit under a little clump of trees on the sloping dirt
terrace in front.Here you will see the true type of the Quarter.It is
the farthest up the Boulevard St.Michel of any of the cafes, and just
opposite the "Bal Bullier," on the Place de l'Observatoire.The terrace
is crowded with its habitues, for it is out of the way of the stream of
people along the "Boul' Miche."The terrace is quite dark, its only
light coming from the cafe, back of a green hedge, and it is cool there,
too, in summer, with the fresh night air coming from the Luxembourg
Gardens.Below it is the cafe and restaurant de la Rotonde, a very
well-built looking place, with its rounding facade on the corner.[Illustration: (studio)]

At the entrance of every studio court and apartment, there lives the
concierge in a box of a room generally, containing a huge feather-bed
and furnished with a variety of things left by departing tenants to this
faithful guardian of the gate.Many of these small rooms resemble the
den of an antiquary with their odds and ends from the studios--old
swords, plaster casts, sketches and discarded furniture--until the place
is quite full.Yet it is kept neat and clean by madame, who sews all day
and talks to her cat and to every one who passes into the court-yard.Here your letters are kept, too, in one of a row of boxes, with the
number of your atelier marked thereon.At night, after ten, your concierge opens the heavy iron gate of your
court by pulling a cord within reach of the family bed.He or she is
waked up at intervals through the night to let into and out of a court
full of studios those to whom the night is ever young.Or perhaps your
concierge will be like old Pere Valois, who has three pretty daughters
who do the housework of the studios, as well as assist in the
guardianship of the gate.They are very busy, these three daughters of
Pere Valois--all the morning you will see these little "femmes de
menage" as busy as bees; the artists and poets must be waked up, and
beds made and studios cleaned.There are many that are never cleaned at
all, but then there are many, too, who are not so fortunate as to be
taken care of by the three daughters of Pere Valois.[Illustration: VOILA LA BELLE ROSE, MADAME!]There is no gossip within the quarter that your "femme de menage" does
not know, and over your morning coffee, which she brings you, she will
regale you with the latest news about most of your best friends,
including your favorite model, and madame from whom you buy your wine,
always concluding with: "That is what I heard, monsieur,--I think it is
quite true, because the little Marie, who is the femme de menage of
Monsieur Valentin, got it from Celeste Dauphine yesterday in the cafe in
the rue du Cherche Midi."In the morning, this demure maid-of-all-work will be in her calico dress
with her sleeves rolled up over her strong white arms, but in the
evening you may see her in a chic little dress, at the "Bal Bullier," or
dining at the Pantheon, with the fellow whose studio is opposite yours.[Illustration: A BUSY MORNING]

Alice Lemaitre, however, was a far different type of femme de menage
than any of the gossiping daughters of old Pere Valois, and her lot was
harder, for one night she left her home in one of the provincial towns,
when barely sixteen, and found herself in Paris with three francs to her
name and not a friend in this big pleasure-loving city to turn to.After
many days of privation, she became bonne to a woman known as Yvette de
Marcie, a lady with a bad temper and many jewels, to whom little Alice,
with her rosy cheeks and bright eyes and willing disposition to work in
order to live, became a person upon whom this fashionable virago of a
demi-mondaine vented the worst that was in her--and there was much of
this--until Alice went out into the world again.She next found
employment at a baker's, where she was obliged to get up at four in the
morning, winter and summer, and deliver the long loaves of bread at the
different houses; but the work was too hard and she left.The baker paid
her a trifle a week for her labor, while the attractive Yvette de Marcie
turned her into the street without her wages.It was while delivering
bread one morning to an atelier in the rue des Dames, that she chanced
to meet a young painter who was looking for a good femme de menage to
relieve his artistic mind from the worries of housekeeping.Little Alice
fairly cried when the good painter told her she might come at twenty
francs a month, which was more money than this very grateful and brave
little Brittany girl had ever known before.[Illustration: (brocanteur shop front)]

"You see, monsieur, one must do one's best whatever one undertakes,"
said Alice to me; "I have tried every profession, and now I am a good
femme de menage, and I am 'bien contente.'No," she continued, "I shall
never marry, for one's independence is worth more than anything else.When one marries," she said earnestly, her little brow in a frown,
"one's life is lost; I am young and strong, and I have courage, and so I
can work hard.One should be content when one is not cold and hungry,
and I have been many times that, monsieur.Once I worked in a fabrique,
where, all day, we painted the combs of china roosters a bright red for
bon-bon boxes--hundreds and hundreds of them until I used to see them in
my dreams; but the fabrique failed, for the patron ran away with the
wife of a Russian.He was a very stupid man to have done that, monsieur,
for he had a very nice wife of his own--a pretty brunette, with a
charming figure; but you see, monsieur, in Paris it is always that way.C'est toujours comme ca."CHAPTER VI

"AT MARCEL LEGAY'S"


Just off the Boulevard St.Michel and up the narrow little rue Cujas,
you will see at night the name "Marcel Legay" illumined in tiny
gas-jets.This is a cabaret of chansonniers known as "Le Grillon," where
a dozen celebrated singing satirists entertain an appreciative audience
in the stuffy little hall serving as an auditorium.Here, nightly, as
the piece de resistance--and late on the programme (there is no printed
one)--you will hear the Bard of Montmartre, Marcel Legay, raconteur,
poet, musician, and singer; the author of many of the most popular songs
of Montmartre, and a veteran singer in the cabarets.[Illustration: MARCEL LEGAY]

From these cabarets of the student quarters come many of the cleverest
and most beautiful songs.Here men sing their own creations, and they
have absolute license to sing or say what they please; there is no
mincing of words, and many times these rare bohemians do not take the
trouble to hide their clever songs and satires under a double entente.No celebrated man or woman, known in art or letters, or connected with
the Government--from the soldier to the good President of the Republique
Francaise--is spared.The eccentricity of each celebrity is caught by
them, and used in song or recitation.Besides these personal caricatures, the latest political questions of
the day--religion and the haut monde--come in for a large share of
good-natured satire.To be cleverly caricatured is an honor, and should
evince no ill-feeling, especially from these clever singing comedians,
who are the best of fellows at heart; whose songs are clever but never
vulgar; who sing because they love to sing; and whose versatility
enables them to create the broadest of satires, and, again, a little
song with words so pure, so human, and so pathetic, that the applause
that follows from the silent room of listeners comes spontaneously from
the heart.It is not to be wondered at that "The Grillon" of Marcel Legay's is a
popular haunt of the habitues of the Quarter, who crowd the dingy little
room nightly.You enter the "Grillon" by way of the bar, and at the
further end of the bar-room is a small anteroom, its walls hung in
clever posters and original drawings.This anteroom serves as a sort of
green-room for the singers and their friends; here they chat at the
little tables between their songs--since there is no stage--and through
this anteroom both audience and singers pass into the little hall.There
is the informality of one of our own "smokers" about the whole affair.Furthermore, no women sing in "Le Grillon"--a cabaret in this respect is
different from a cafe concert, which resembles very much our smaller
variety shows.A small upright piano, and in front of it a low platform,
scarcely its length, complete the necessary stage paraphernalia of the
cabaret, and the admission is generally a franc and a half, which
includes your drink.In the anteroom, four of the singers are smoking and chatting at the
little tables.One of them is a tall, serious-looking fellow, in a black
frock coat.He peers out through his black-rimmed eyeglasses with the
solemnity of an owl--but you should hear his songs!--they treat of the
lighter side of life, I assure you.Another singer has just finished his
turn, and comes out of the smoky hall, wiping the perspiration from his
short, fat neck.The audience is still applauding his last song, and he
rushes back through the faded green velvet portieres to bow his thanks.[Illustration: A POET-SINGER]

A broad-shouldered, jolly-looking fellow, in white duck trousers, is
talking earnestly with the owl-like looking bard in eyeglasses.Suddenly
his turn is called, and you follow him in, where, as soon as he is seen,
he is welcomed by cheers from the students and girls, and an elaborate
fanfare of chords on the piano.When this popular poet-singer has
finished, there follows a round of applause and a pounding of canes,
and then the ruddy-faced, gray-haired manager starts a three-times-three
handclapping in unison to a pounding of chords on the piano.This is the
proper ending to every demand for an encore in "Le Grillon," and it
never fails to bring one.It is nearly eleven when the curtain parts and Marcel Legay rushes
hurriedly up the aisle and greets the audience, slamming his straw hat
upon the lid of the piano.He passes his hand over his bald pate--gives
an extra polish to his eyeglasses--beams with an irresistibly funny
expression upon his audience--coughs--whistles--passes a few remarks,
and then, adjusting his glasses on his stubby red nose, looks
serio-comically over his roll of music.He is dressed in a long, black
frock-coat reaching nearly to his heels.This coat, with its velvet
collar, discloses a frilled white shirt and a white flowing bow scarf;
these, with a pair of black-and-white check trousers, complete this
every-day attire.But the man inside these voluminous clothes is even still more
eccentric.Short, indefinitely past fifty years of age, with a round
face and merry eyes, and a bald head whose lower portion is framed
in a fringe of long hair, reminding one of the coiffure of some
pre-Raphaelite saint--indeed, so striking is this resemblance that the
good bard is often caricatured with a halo surrounding this medieval
fringe.In the meantime, while this famous singer is selecting a song, he is
overwhelmed with demands for his most popular ones.A dozen students and
girls at one end of the little hall, now swimming in a haze of pipe and
cigarette smoke, are hammering with sticks and parasols for "Le matador
avec les pieds du vent"; another crowd is yelling for "La Goularde."Marcel Legay smiles at them all through his eyeglasses, then roars at
them to keep quiet--and finally the clamor in the room gradually
subsides--here and there a word--a giggle--and finally silence."Now, my children, I will sing to you the story of Clarette," says the
bard; "it is a very sad histoire.I have read it," and he smiles and
cocks one eye.His baritone voice still possesses considerable fire, and in his heroic
songs he is dramatic.In "The Miller who grinds for Love," the feeling
and intensity and dramatic quality he puts into its rendition are
stirring.As he finishes his last encore, amidst a round of applause, he
grasps his hat from the piano, jams it over his bald pate with its
celestial fringe, and rushes for the door.Here he stops, and, turning
for a second, cheers back at the crowd, waving the straw hat above his
head.The next moment he is having a cooling drink among his confreres
in the anteroom.Such "poet-singers" as Paul Delmet and Dominique Bonnaud have made the
"Grillon" a success; and others like Numa Bles, Gabriel Montoya,
D'Herval, Fargy, Tourtal, and Edmond Teulet--all of them well-known over
in Montmartre, where they are welcomed with the same popularity that
they meet with at "Le Grillon."Genius, alas, is but poorly paid in this Bohemia!There are so many who
can draw, so many who can sing, so many poets and writers and sculptors.To many of the cleverest, half a loaf is too often better than no
bread.You will find often in these cabarets and in the cafes and along the
boulevard, a man who, for a few sous, will render a portrait or a
caricature on the spot.You learn that this journeyman artist once was a
well-known painter of the Quarter, who had drawn for years in the
academies.The man at present is a wreck, as he sits in a cafe with
portfolio on his knees, his black slouch hat drawn over his scraggly
gray hair.But his hand, thin and drawn from too much stimulant and too
little food, has lost none of its knowledge of form and line; the sketch
is strong, true, and with a chic about it and a simplicity of expression
that delight you.[Illustration: THE SATIRIST]

"Ah!"he replies, "it is a long story, monsieur."So long and so much of
it that he can not remember it all!Perhaps it was the woman with the
velvety black eyes--tall and straight--the best dancer in all Paris.Yes, he remembers some of it--long, miserable years--years of struggles
and jealousy, and finally lies and fights and drunkenness; after it was
all over, he was too gray and old and tired to care!One sees many such derelicts in Paris among these people who have worn
themselves out with amusement, for here the world lives for pleasure,
for "la grande vie!"To the man, every serious effort he is obliged to
make trends toward one idea--that of the bon vivant--to gain success and
fame, but to gain it with the idea of how much personal daily pleasure
it will bring him.Ennui is a word one hears constantly; if it rains
toute le monde est triste.To have one's gaiety interrupted is regarded
as a calamity, and "tout le monde" will sympathize with you.To live a
day without the pleasures of life in proportion to one's purse is
considered a day lost.If you speak of anything that has pleased you one will, with a gay
rising inflection of the voice and a smile, say: "Ah!c'est gai
la-bas--and monsieur was well amused while in that beautiful
country?"they will exclaim, as you
enthusiastically continue to explain.They never dull your enthusiasm
by short phlegmatic or pessimistic replies.And when you are sad
they will condone so genuinely with you that you forget your
disappointments in the charming pleasantry of their sympathy.But all
this continual race for pleasure is destined in the course of time to
end in ennui!The Parisian goes into the latest sport because it affords him a
new sensation.Being blase of all else in life, he plunges into
automobiling, buys a white and red racer--a ponderous flying juggernaut
that growls and snorts and smells of the lower regions whenever it
stands still, trembling in its anger and impatience to be off, while its
owner, with some automobiling Marie, sits chatting on the cafe terrace
over a cooling drink.The two are covered with dust and very thirsty;
Marie wears a long dust-colored ulster, and he a wind-proof coat and
high boots.Meanwhile, the locomotive-like affair at the curbstone is
working itself into a boiling rage, until finally the brave chauffeur
and his chic companion prepare to depart.Marie adjusts her white lace
veil, with its goggles, and the chauffeur puts on his own mask as he
climbs in; a roar--a snort, a cloud of blue gas, and they are gone!There are other enthusiasts--those who go up in balloons!one cries enthusiastically, "to be 'en
ballon'--so poetic--so fin de siecle!It is a fantaisie charmante!"In a balloon one forgets the world--one is no longer a part of it--no
longer mortal.What romance there is in going up above everything with
the woman one loves--comrades in danger--the ropes--the wicker cage--the
ceiling of stars above one and Paris below no bigger than a gridiron!How chic to shoot straight
up among the drifting clouds and forget the sordid little world, even
the memory of one's intrigues!"Enfin seuls," they say to each other, as the big Frenchman and the chic
Parisienne countess peer down over the edge of the basket, sipping a
little chartreuse from the same traveling cup; she, with the black hair
and white skin, and gowned "en ballon" in a costume by Paillard; he in
his peajacket buttoned close under his heavy beard.They seem to brush
through and against the clouds!A gentle breath from heaven makes the
basket decline a little and the ropes creak against the hardwood clinch
blocks.It grows colder, and he wraps her closer in his own coat."Courage, my child," he says; "see, we have gone a great distance;
to-morrow before sundown we shall descend in Belgium."cries the Countess; "I do not like those Belgians."but you shall see, Therese, one shall go where one pleases soon; we
are patient, we aeronauts; we shall bring credit to La Belle France; we
have courage and perseverance; we shall give many dinners and weep over
the failures of our brave comrades, to make the dirigible balloon
'pratique.'our dejeuner in Paris and our
dinner where we will."Therese taps her polished nails against the edge of the wicker cage and
hums a little chansonette."Je t'aime"--she murmurs.*     *     *     *     *

I did not see this myself, and I do not know the fair Therese or the
gentleman who buttons his coat under his whiskers; but you should have
heard one of these ballooning enthusiasts tell it to me in the Taverne
du Pantheon the other night.His only regret seemed to be that he, too,
could not have a dirigible balloon and a countess--on ten francs a
week![Illustration: (woman)]

CHAPTER VII

"POCHARD"


Drunkards are not frequent sights in the Quarter; and yet when these
people do get drunk, they become as irresponsible as maniacs.Excitable
to a degree even when sober, these most wretched among the poor when
drunk often appear in front of a cafe--gaunt, wild-eyed, haggard, and
filthy--singing in boisterous tones or reciting to you with tense voices
a jumble of meaningless thoughts.The man with the matted hair, and toes out of his boots, will fold his
arms melodramatically, and regard you for some moments as you sit in
front of him on the terrace.Then he will vent upon you a torrent
of abuse, ending in some jumble of socialistic ideas of his own
concoction.When he has finished, he will fold his arms again and move
on to the next table.He is crazy with absinthe, and no one pays any
attention to him.On he strides up the "Boul' Miche," past the cafes,
continuing his ravings.As long as he is moderately peaceful and
confines his wandering brain to gesticulations and speech, he is let
alone by the police.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

You will see sometimes a man and a woman--a teamster out of work or with
his wages for the day, and with him a creature--a blear-eyed, slatternly
looking woman, in a filthy calico gown.The man clutches her arm, as
they sing and stagger up past the cafes.The woman holds in her
claw-like hand a half-empty bottle of cheap red wine.Now and then they
stop and share it; the man staggers on; the woman leers and dances and
sings; a crowd forms about them.Some years ago this poor girl sat on
Friday afternoons in the Luxembourg Gardens--her white parasol on her
knees, her dainty, white kid-slippered feet resting on the little stool
which the old lady, who rents the chairs, used to bring her.She was
regarded as a bonne camarade in those days among the students--one of
the idols of the Quarter!But she became impossible, and then an
outcast!That women should become outcasts through the hopelessness of
their position or the breaking down of their brains can be understood,
but that men of ability should sink into the dregs and stay there seems
incredible.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

Near the rue Monge there is a small cafe and restaurant, a place
celebrated for its onion soup and its chicken.From the tables outside,
one can see into the small kitchen, with its polished copper sauce-pans
hanging about the grill.Lachaume, the painter, and I were chatting at one of its little tables,
he over an absinthe and I over a coffee and cognac.I had dined early
this fresh October evening, enjoying to the full the bracing coolness of
the air, pungent with the odor of dry leaves and the faint smell of
burning brush.The world was hurrying by--in twos and threes--hurrying
to warm cafes, to friends, to lovers.The breeze at twilight set the dry
leaves shivering.The yellow glow from the
shop windows--the blue-white sparkle of electricity like pendant
diamonds--made the Quarter seem fuller of life than ever.These fall
days make the little ouvrieres trip along from their work with rosy
cheeks, and put happiness and ambition into one's very soul.[Illustration: A GROUP OF NEW STUDIOS]

Soon the winter will come, with all the boys back from their country
haunts, and Celeste and Mimi from Ostende.How gay it will be--this
Quartier Latin then!How gay it always is in winter--and then the rainy
season.Thus it was that Lachaume
and I sat talking, when suddenly a spectre passed--a spectre of a man,
his face silent, white, and pinched--drawn like a mummy's.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S MODEL]

He stopped and supported his shrunken frame wearily on his crutches, and
leaned against a neighboring wall.He made no sound--simply gazed
vacantly, with the timidity of some animal, at the door of the small
kitchen aglow with the light from the grill.He made no effort to
approach the door; only leaned against the gray wall and peered at it
patiently."A beggar," I said to Lachaume; "poor devil!"old Pochard--yes, poor devil, and once one of the handsomest men in
Paris.""What I'm drinking now, mon ami."He looks older than I do, does he not?"continued
Lachaume, lighting a fresh cigarette, "and yet I'm twenty years his
senior.You see, I sip mine--he drank his by the goblet," and my friend
leaned forward and poured the contents of the carafe in a tiny
trickling stream over the sugar lying in its perforated spoon.[Illustration: BOY MODEL]

"Ah!those were great days when Pochard was the life of the Bullier," he
went on; "I remember the night he won ten thousand francs from the
Russian.It didn't last long; Camille Leroux had her share of
it--nothing ever lasted long with Camille.He was once courrier to an
Austrian Baron, I remember.The old fellow used to frequent the Quarter
in summer, years ago--it was his hobby.Pochard was a great favorite in
those days, and the Baron liked to go about in the Quarter with him, and
of course Pochard was in his glory.He would persuade the old nobleman
to prolong his vacation here.Once the Baron stayed through the winter
and fell ill, and a little couturiere in the rue de Rennes, whom the old
fellow fell in love with, nursed him.He died the summer following, at
Vienna, and left her quite a little property near Amiens.He was a good
old Baron, a charitable old fellow among the needy, and a good bohemian
besides; and he did much for Pochard, but he could not keep him sober!"[Illustration: BOUGUEREAU AT WORK]

"After the old man's death," my friend continued, "Pochard drifted from
bad to worse, and finally out of the Quarter, somewhere into misery on
the other side of the Seine.No one heard of him for a few years, until
he was again recognized as being the same Pochard returned again to the
Quarter.He was hobbling about on crutches just as you see him there.And now, do you know what he does?Get up from where you are sitting,"
said Lachaume, "and look into the back kitchen.Is he not standing there
by the door--they are handing him a small bundle?""Yes," said I, "something wrapped in newspaper.""Do you know what is in it?--the carcass of the chicken you have just
finished, and which the garcon carried away.Pochard saw you eating it
half an hour ago as he passed."No, to sell," Lachaume replied, "together with the other bones he is
able to collect--for soup in some poorest resort down by the river,
where the boatmen and the gamins go.The few sous he gets will buy
Pochard a big glass, a lump of sugar, and a spoon; into the goblet, in
some equally dirty 'boite,' they will pour him out his green treasure of
absinthe.Then Pochard will forget the day--perhaps he will dream of the
Austrian Baron--and try and forget Camille Leroux.[Illustration: GEROME]

Marguerite Girardet, the model, also told me between poses in the studio
the other day of just such a "pauvre homme" she once knew."When he was
young," she said, "he won a second prize at the Conservatoire, and
afterward played first violin at the Comique.Now he plays in front of
the cafes, like the rest, and sometimes poses for the head of an old
man![Illustration: A. MICHELENA]

"Many grow old so young," she continued; "I knew a little model once
with a beautiful figure, absolutely comme un bijou--pretty, too, and
had she been a sensible girl, as I often told her, she could still have
earned her ten francs a day posing; but she wanted to dine all the time
with this and that one, and pose too, and in three months all her fine
'svelte' lines that made her a valuable model among the sculptors were
gone.You see, I have posed all my life in the studios, and I am over
thirty now, and you know I work hard, but I have kept my fine
lines--because I go to bed early and eat and drink little.Then I have
much to do at home; my husband and I for years have had a comfortable
home; we take a great deal of pride in it, and it keeps me very busy to
keep everything in order, for I pose very early some mornings and then
go back and get dejeuner, and then back to pose again.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S STUDIO]

"In the summer," she went on, "we take a little place outside of Paris
for a month, down the Seine, where my husband brings his work with him;
he is a repairer of fans and objets d'art.You should come in and see us
some time; it is quite near where you painted last summer.Ah yes," she
exclaimed, as she drew her pink toes under her, "I love the country!Last year I posed nearly two months for Monsieur Z., the painter--en
plein air; my skin was not as white as it is now, I can tell you--I was
absolutely like an Indian![Illustration: FREMIET]

"Once"--and Marguerite smiled at the memory of it--"I went to England to
pose for a painter well known there.It was an important tableau, and I
stayed there six months.It was a horrible place to me--I was always
cold--the fog was so thick one could hardly see in winter mornings going
to the studio.Besides, I could get nothing good to eat!He was a
celebrated painter, a 'Sir,' and lived with his family in a big stone
house with a garden.We had tea and cakes at five in the studio--always
tea, tea, tea!--I can tell you I used to long for a good bottle of
Madame Giraud's vin ordinaire, and a poulet.So I left and came back to
Paris.J'etais toujours, toujours
triste la!In Paris I make a good living; ten francs a day--that's not
bad, is it?and my time is taken often a year ahead.I like to pose for
the painters--the studios are cleaner than those of the sculptor's.Some
of the sculptors' studios are so dirty--clay and dust over everything!Did you see Fabien's studio the other day when I posed for him?Tiens!--you should have seen it last year when he was
working on the big group for the Exposition!It is clean now compared
with what it was.You see, I go to my work in the plainest of clothes--a
cheap print dress and everything of the simplest I can make, for in half
an hour, left in those studios, they would be fit only for the
blanchisseuse--the wax and dust are in and over everything!There is
no time to change when one has not the time to go home at mid-day."[Illustration: JEAN PAUL LAURENS]

And so I learned much of the good sense and many of the economies in the
life of this most celebrated model.You can see her superb figure
wrought in marble and bronze by some of the most famous of modern French
sculptors all over Paris.There is another type of model you will see, too--one who rang my bell
one sunny morning in response to a note written by my good friend, the
sculptor, for whom this little Parisienne posed.She came without her hat--this "vrai type"--about seventeen years of
age--with exquisite features, her blue eyes shining under a wealth of
delicate blonde hair arranged in the prettiest of fashions--a little
white bow tied jauntily at her throat, and her exquisitely delicate,
strong young figure clothed in a simple black dress.She had about her
such a frank, childlike air!Yes, she posed for so and so, and so and
so, but not many; she liked it better than being in a shop; and it
was far more independent, for one could go about and see one's
friends--and there were many of her girl friends living on the same
street where this chic demoiselle lived.As she sat buttoning her boots, she
looked up at me innocently, slipped her five francs for the morning's
work in her reticule, and said:

"I live with mama, and mama never gives me any money to spend on myself.This is Sunday and a holiday, so I shall go with Henriette and her
brother to Vincennes.[Illustration: OLD MAN MODEL]

It would have been quite impossible for me to have gone with them--I was
not even invited; but this very serious and good little Parisienne, who
posed for the figure with quite the same unconsciousness as she would
have handed you your change over the counter of some stuffy little shop,
went to Vincennes with Henriette and her brother, where they had a
beautiful day--scrambling up the paths and listening to the band--all at
the enormous expense of the artist; and this was how this good little
Parisienne managed to save five francs in a single day!There are old-men models who knock at your studio too, and who are
celebrated for their tangled gray locks, which they immediately
uncover as you open your door.These unkempt-looking Father Times and
Methuselahs prowl about the staircases of the different ateliers daily.So do little children--mostly Italians and all filthily dirty; swarthy,
black-eyed, gypsy-looking girls and boys of from twelve to fifteen years
of age, and Italian mothers holding small children--itinerant madonnas.These are the poorer class of models--the riff-raff of the Quarter--who
get anywhere from a few sous to a few francs for a seance.And there are four-footed models, too, for I know a kindly old horse who
has served in many a studio and who has carried a score of the famous
generals of the world and Jeanne d'Arcs to battle--in many a modern
public square.CHAPTER VIII

THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS


In this busy Quarter, where so many people are confined throughout the
day in work-shops and studios, a breathing-space becomes a necessity.The
gardens of the Luxembourg, brilliant in flowers and laid out in the
Renaissance, with shady groves and long avenues of chestnut-trees
stretching up to the Place de l'Observatoire, afford the great
breathing-ground for the Latin Quarter.If one had but an hour to spend in the Quartier Latin, one could not
find a more interesting and representative sight of student life than
between the hours of four and five on Friday afternoon, when the
military band plays in the Luxembourg Gardens.This is the afternoon
when Bohemia is on parade.Then every one flocks here to see one's
friends--and a sort of weekly reception for the Quarter is held.The
walks about the band-stand are thronged with students and girls,
and hundreds of chairs are filled with an audience of the older
people--shopkeepers and their families, old women in white lace caps,
and gray-haired old men, many in straight-brimmed high hats of a mode of
twenty years past.Here they sit and listen to the music under the cool
shadow of the trees, whose rich foliage forms an arbor overhead--a roof
of green leaves, through which the sunbeams stream and in which the fat,
gray pigeons find a paradise.[Illustration: THE CHILDREN'S SHOP--LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

There is a booth near-by where waffles, cooked on a small oven in the
rear, are sold.In front are a dozen or more tables for ices and
drinkables.Every table and chair is taken within hearing distance of
the band.When these musicians of the army of France arrive, marching in
twos from their barracks to the stand, it is always the signal for that
genuine enthusiasm among the waiting crowd which one sees between the
French and their soldiers.If you chance to sit among the groups at the little tables, and watch
the passing throng in front of you, you will see some queer "types,"
many of them seldom en evidence except on these Friday afternoons in the
Luxembourg.Buried, no doubt, in some garret hermitage or studio, they
emerge thus weekly to greet silently the passing world.A tall poet stalks slowly by, reading intently, as he walks, a well-worn
volume of verses--his faded straw hat shading the tip of his long nose.Following him, a boy of twenty, delicately featured, with that purity of
expression one sees in the faces of the good--the result of a life,
perhaps, given to his ideal in art.He wears his hair long and curling
over his ears, with a long stray wisp over one eye, the whole cropped
evenly at the back as it reaches his black velvet collar.He wears, too,
a dove-gray vest of fine corduroy, buttoned behind like those of the
clergy, and a velvet tam-o'-shanter-like cap, and carries between his
teeth a small pipe with a long goose-quill stem.You can readily see
that to this young man with high ideals there is only one corner of the
world worth living in, and that lies between the Place de l'Observatoire
and the Seine.Three students pass, in wide broadcloth trousers, gathered in tight at
the ankles, and wearing wide-brimmed black hats.Hanging on the arm of
one of the trio is a short snub-nosed girl, whose Cleo-Merodic hair,
flattened in a bandeau over her ears, not only completely conceals them,
but all the rest of her face, except her two merry black eyes and her
saucy and neatly rouged lips.She is in black bicycle bloomers and a
white, short duck jacket--a straw hat with a wide blue ribbon band, and
a fluffy piece of white tulle tied at the side of her neck.It is impossible, in such a close
crowd, to be in a hurry; besides, one never is here.Near-by sit two old ladies, evidently concierges from some atelier
court.One holds the printed program of the music, cut carefully from
her weekly newspaper; it is cheaper than buying one for two sous, and
these old concierges are economical.In this Friday gathering you will recognize dozens of faces which you
have seen at the "Bal Bullier" and the cafes.The girl in the blue tailor-made dress, with the little dog, who you
remember dined the night before at the Pantheon, is walking now arm in
arm with a tall man in black, a mourning band about his hat.The girl is
dressed in black, too--a mark of respect to her ami by her side.The
dog, who is so small that he slides along the walk every time his chain
is pulled, is now tucked under her arm.One of the tables near the waffle stand is taken by a group of six
students and four girls.All of them have arrived at the table in the
last fifteen minutes--some alone, some in twos.The girl in the scarlet
gown and white kid slippers, who came with the queer-looking "type"
with the pointed beard, is Yvonne Gallois--a bonne camarade.She keeps
the rest in the best of spirits, for she is witty, this Yvonne, and a
great favorite with the crowd she is with.She is pretty, too, and has a
whole-souled good-humor about her that makes her ever welcome.The
fellow she came with is Delmet the architect--a great wag--lazy, but
full of fun--and genius.The little girl sitting opposite Yvonne is Claire Dumont.She is
explaining a very sad "histoire" to the "type" next to her, intense in
the recital of her woes.Her alert, nervous little face is a study; when
words and expression fail, she shrugs her delicate shoulders, accenting
every sentence with her hands, until it seems as if her small, nervous
frame could express no more--and all about her little dog "Loisette!"[Illustration: AT THE HEAD OF THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

"Yes, the villain of a concierge at Edmond's studio swore at him twice,
and Sunday, when Edmond and I were breakfasting late, the old beast saw
'Loisette' on the stairs and threw water over her; she is a sale bete,
that grosse femme!She shall see what it will cost her, the old miser;
and you know I have always been most amiable with her.She is jealous
of me--that is it--oh!Poor
'Loisette'--she shivered all night with fright and from being wet.Edmond and I are going to find another place.Yes, she shall see what it
will be there without us--with no one to depend upon for her snuff and
her wine.If she were concierge at Edmond's old atelier she would be
treated like that horrid old Madame Fouquet."The boys in the atelier over her window hated this old Madame Fouquet, I
remember.She was always prying about and complaining, so they fished up
her pet gold-fish out of the aquarium on her window-sill, and fried them
on the atelier stove, and put them back in the window on a little plate
all garnished with carrots.She swore vengeance and called in the
police, but to no avail.One day they fished up the parrot in its cage,
and the green bird that screamed and squawked continually met a speedy
and painless death and went off to the taxidermist.Then the cage was
lowered in its place with the door left ajar, and the old woman felt
sure that her pet had escaped and would some day find his way back to
her--a thing this garrulous bird would never have thought of doing had
he had any say in the matter.So the old lady left the door of the cage open for days in the event of
his return, and strange to tell, one morning Madame Fouquet got up to
quarrel with her next-door neighbor, and, to her amazement, there was
her green pet on his perch in his cage.She called to him, but he did
not answer; he simply stood on his wired legs and fixed his glassy eyes
on her, and said not a word--while the gang of Indians in the windows
above yelled themselves hoarse.It was just such a crowd as this that initiated a "nouveau" once in one
of the ateliers.They stripped the new-comer, and, as is often the
custom on similar festive occasions, painted him all over with
sketches, done in the powdered water-colors that come in glass jars.They are cheap and cover a lot of surface, so that the gentleman in
question looked like a human picture-gallery.After the ceremony, he was
put in a hamper and deposited, in the morning, in the middle of the Pont
des Arts, where he was subsequently found by the police, who carted him
off in a cab.[Illustration: THE FONTAINE DE MEDICIS]

But you must see more of this vast garden of the Luxembourg to
appreciate truly its beauty and its charm.Filled with beautiful
sculpture in bronze and marble, with its musee of famous modern pictures
bought by the Government, with flower-beds brilliant in geraniums and
fragrant in roses, with the big basin spouting a jet of water in its
center, where the children sail their boats, and with that superb
"Fontaine de Medicis" at the end of a long, rectangular basin of
water--dark as some pool in a forest brook, the green vines trailing
about its sides, shaded by the rich foliage of the trees overhead.On the other side of the Luxembourg you will find a garden of roses,
with a rich bronze group of Greek runners in the center, and near it,
back of the long marble balustrade, a croquet ground--a favorite spot
for several veteran enthusiasts who play here regularly, surrounded for
hours by an interested crowd who applaud and cheer the participants in
this passe sport.This is another way of spending an afternoon at the sole cost of one's
leisure.Often at the Punch and Judy show near-by, you will see two old
gentlemen,--who may have watched this same Punch and Judy show when they
were youngsters,--and who have been sitting for half an hour, waiting
for the curtain of the miniature theater to rise.It is popular--this
small "Theatre Guignol," and the benches in front are filled with the
children of rich and poor, who scream with delight and kick their
little, fat bare legs at the first shrill squeak of Mr.The three
who compose the staff of this tiny attraction have been long in its
service--the old harpist, and the good wife of the showman who knows
every child in the neighborhood, and her husband who is Mr.Punch, the
hangman, and the gendarme, and half a dozen other equally historical
personages.A thin, sad-looking man, this husband, gray-haired, with a
careworn look in his deep-sunken eyes, who works harder hourly, daily,
yearly, to amuse the heart of a child than almost any one I know.The little box of a theater is stifling hot in summer, and yet he must
laugh and scream and sing within it, while his good wife collects the
sous, talking all the while to this and to that child whom she has known
since its babyhood; chatting with the nurses decked out in their
gay-colored, Alsatian bows, the ribbons reaching nearly to the ground.A French nurse is a gorgeous spectacle of neatness and cleanliness, and
many of the younger ones, fresh from country homes in Normandy and
Brittany, with their rosy cheeks, are pictures of health.Wherever you
see a nurse, you will see a "piou-piou" not far away, which is a very
belittling word for the red-trousered infantryman of the Republique
Francaise.Surrounding the Palais du Luxembourg, these "piou-pious," less fortunate
for the hour, stand guard in the small striped sentry-boxes, musket at
side, or pace stolidly up and down the flagged walk.Marie, at the
moment, is no doubt with the children of the rich Count, in a shady spot
near the music.How cruel is the fate of many a gallant "piou-piou"!Farther down the gravel-walk strolls a young Frenchman and his
fiancee--the mother of his betrothed inevitably at her side!It is under
this system of rigid chaperonage that the young girl of France is given
in marriage.It is not to be wondered at that many of them marry to be
free, and that many of the happier marriages have begun with an
elopement![Illustration: THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURG]

The music is over, and the band is filing out, followed by the crowd.A
few linger about the walks around the band-stand to chat.The old lady
who rents the chairs is stacking them up about the tree-trunks, and long
shadows across the walks tell of the approaching twilight.Overhead,
among the leaves, the pigeons coo.For a few moments the sun bathes
the great garden in a pinkish glow, then drops slowly, a blood-red disk,
behind the trees.The air grows chilly; it is again the hour to
dine--the hour when Paris wakes.In the smaller restaurants of the Quarter one often sees some strange
contrasts among these true bohemians, for the Latin Quarter draws its
habitues from every part of the globe.They are not all French--these
happy-go-lucky fellows, who live for the day and let the morrow slide.You will see many Japanese--some of them painters--many of them taking
courses in political economy, or in law; many of them titled men of high
rank in their own country, studying in the schools, and learning, too,
with that thoroughness and rapidity which are ever characteristic of
their race.You will find, too, Brazilians; gentlemen from Haiti of
darker hue; Russians, Poles, and Spaniards--men and women from every
clime and every station in life.They adapt themselves to the Quarter
and become a part of this big family of Bohemia easily and naturally.In this daily atmosphere only the girl-student from our own shores seems
out of place.She will hunt for some small restaurant, sacred in its
exclusiveness and known only to a dozen bon camarades of the Quarter.Perhaps this girl-student, it may be, from the West and her cousin from
the East will discover some such cosy little boite on their way back
from their atelier.To two other equally adventurous female minds they
will impart this newest find; after that you will see the four dining
there nightly together, as safe, I assure you, within these walls of
Bohemia as they would be at home rocking on their Aunt Mary's porch.There is, of course, considerable awkwardness between these bon
camarades, to whom the place really belongs, and these very innocent
new-comers, who seek a table by themselves in a corner under the few
trees in front of the small restaurant.And yet every one is exceedingly
polite to them.Madame the patronne hustles about to see that the dinner
is warm and nicely served; and Henriette, who is waiting on them, none
the less attentive, although she is late for her own dinner, which she
will sit down to presently with madame the patronne, the good cook, and
the other girls who serve the small tables.[Illustration: WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE THEATERS]

This later feast will be augmented perhaps by half the good boys and
girls who have been dining at the long table.Perhaps they will all come
in and help shell the peas for to-morrow's dinner.And yet this is a
public place, where the painters come, and where one pays only for what
one orders.It is all very interesting to the four American girls, who
are dining at the small table.But what must Mimi think of these silent and exclusive strangers, and
what, too, must the tall girl in the bicycle bloomers think, and the
little girl who has been ill and who at the moment is dining with
Renould, the artist, and whom every one--even to the cook, is so glad to
welcome back after her long illness?There is an unsurmountable barrier
between the Americans at the little table in the corner and that jolly
crowd of good and kindly people at the long one, for Mimi and Henriette
and the little girl who has been so ill, and the French painters and
sculptors with them, cannot understand either the language of these
strangers or their views of life.exclaims one of the strangers in a whisper, "do look at that
queer little 'type' at the long table--the tall girl in black actually
kissed him!"Why, my dear, I saw it plainly!"There is no law against kissing in the open air in Paris,
and besides, the tall girl in black has known the little "type" for a
Parisienne age--thirty days or less.The four innocents, who have coughed through their soup and whispered
through the rest of the dinner, have now finished and are leaving, but
if those at the long table notice their departure, they do not show it.In the Quarter it is considered the height of rudeness to stare.You
will find these Suzannes and Marcelles exceedingly well-bred in the
little refinements of life, and you will note a certain innate dignity
and kindliness in their bearing toward others, which often makes one
wish to uncover his head in their presence.CHAPTER IX

"THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE QUARTER"


There are many streets of the Quarter as quiet as those of a country
village.Some of them, like the rue Vaugirard, lead out past gloomy
slaughter-houses and stables, through desolate sections of vacant
lots, littered with the ruins of factory and foundry whose tall,
smoke-begrimed chimneys in the dark stand like giant sentries, as if
pointing a warning finger to the approaching pedestrian, for these
ragged edges of the Quarter often afford at night a lurking-ground for
footpads.In just such desolation there lived a dozen students, in a small nest of
studios that I need not say were rented to them at a price within their
ever-scanty means.It was marveled at among the boys in the Quarter that
any of these exiles lived to see the light of another day, after
wandering back at all hours of the night to their stronghold.Possibly their sole possessions consisted of the clothes they had on, a
few bad pictures, and their several immortal geniuses.That the
gentlemen with the sand-bags knew of this I am convinced, for the
students were never molested.Verily, Providence lends a strong and
ready arm to the drunken man and the fool!The farther out one goes on the rue Vaugirard, the more desolate
and forbidding becomes this long highway, until it terminates at
the fortifications, near which is a huge, open field, kept clear
of such permanent buildings as might shelter an enemy in time of
war.Scattered over this space are the hovels of squatters and
gipsies--fortune-telling, horse-trading vagabonds, whose living-vans
at certain times of the year form part of the smaller fairs within
the Quarter.[Illustration: (factory chimneys along empty street)]

And very small and unattractive little fairs they are, consisting of
half a dozen or more wagons, serving as a yearly abode for these
shiftless people; illumined at night by the glare of smoking oil
torches.There is, moreover, a dingy tent with a half-drawn red curtain
that hides the fortune-telling beauty; and a traveling shooting-gallery,
so short that the muzzle of one's rifle nearly rests upon the painted
lady with the sheet-iron breastbone, centered by a pinhead of a
bull's-eye which never rings.There is often a small carousel, too,
which is not only patronized by the children, but often by a crowd of
students--boys and girls, who literally turn the merry-go-round into a
circus, and who for the time are cheered to feats of bareback riding by
the enthusiastic bystanders.These little Quarter fetes are far different from the great fete de
Neuilly across the Seine, which begins at the Porte Maillot, and
continues in a long, glittering avenue of side-shows, with mammoth
carousels, bizarre in looking-glass panels and golden figures.Within
the circle of all this throne-like gorgeousness, a horse-power organ
shakes the very ground with its clarion blasts, while pink and white
wooden pigs, their tails tied up in bows of colored ribbons, heave and
swoop round and round, their backs loaded with screaming girls and
shouting men.It was near this very same Port Maillot, in a colossal theater, built
originally for the representation of one of the Kiralfy ballets, that a
fellow student and myself went over from the Quarter one night to "supe"
in a spectacular and melodramatic pantomime, entitled "Afrique a Paris."We were invited by the sole proprietor and manager of the show--an
old circus-man, and one of the shrewdest, most companionable, and
intelligent of men, who had traveled the world over.He spoke no
language but his own unadulterated American.This, with his dominant
personality, served him wherever fortune carried him!So, accepting his invitation to play alternately the dying soldier and
the pursuing cannibal under the scorching rays of a tropical limelight,
and with an old pair of trousers and a flannel shirt wrapped in a
newspaper, we presented ourselves at the appointed hour, at the edge of
the hostile country.[Illustration: (street scene)]

Here we found ourselves surrounded by a horde of savages who needed no
greasepaint to stain their ebony bodies, and many of whose grinning
countenances I had often recognized along our own Tenderloin.Besides,
there were cowboys and "greasers" and diving elks, and a company of
French Zouaves; the latter, in fact, seemed to be the only thing foreign
about the show.Our friend, the manager, informed us that he had thrown
the entire spectacle together in about ten days, and that he had
gathered with ease, in two, a hundred of those dusky warriors, who had
left their coat-room and barber-shop jobs in New York to find themselves
stranded in Paris.He was a hustler, this circus-man, and preceding the spectacle of the
African war, he had entertained the audience with a short variety-show,
to brace the spectacle.He insisted on bringing us around in front and
giving us a box, so we could see for ourselves how good it really was.During this forepart, and after some clever high trapeze work,
the sensation of the evening was announced--a Signore, with an
unpronounceable name, would train a den of ten forest-bred lions!When the orchestra had finished playing "The Awakening of the Lion," the
curtain rose, disclosing the nerveless Signore in purple tights and
high-topped boots.A long, portable cage had been put together on the
stage during the intermission, and within it the ten pacing beasts.There is something terrifying about the roar of a lion as it begins with
its high-keyed moan, and descends in scale to a hoarse roar that seems
to penetrate one's whole nervous system.But the Signore did not seem to mind it; he placed one foot on the sill
of the safety-door, tucked his short riding-whip under his arm, pulled
the latch with one hand, forced one knee in the slightly opened door,
and sprang into the cage.went the iron door as it found its
lock.went the Signore's revolver, as he drove the snarling,
roaring lot into the corner of the cage.The smoke from his revolver
drifted out through the bars; the house was silent.The trainer walked
slowly up to the fiercest lion, who reared against the bars as he
approached him, striking at the trainer with his heavy paws, while the
others slunk into the opposite corner.The man's head was but half a
foot now from the lion's; he menaced the beast with the little
riding-whip; he almost, but did not quite strike him on the tip of his
black nose that worked convulsively in rage.Then the lion dropped
awkwardly, with a short growl, to his forelegs, and slunk, with the
rest, into the corner.It was the little
riding-whip they feared, for they had never gauged its sting.Not the
heavy iron bar within reach of his hand, whose force they knew."An ugly lot," I said, turning to our friend the manager, who had taken
his seat beside me."Yes," he mused, peering at the stage with his keen gray eyes; "green
stock, but a swell act, eh?I've got a
girl here who comes on and does art poses among the lions; she's a
dream--French, too!"A girl of perhaps twenty, enveloped in a bath gown, now appeared at the
wings.The next instant the huge theater became dark, and she stood in
full fleshings, in the center of the cage, brilliant in the rays of a
powerful limelight, while the lions circled about her at the command of
the trainer."Yes," said I, "she is.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

"No, she never worked with the cats before," he said; "she's new to the
show business; she said her folks live in Nantes.She worked here in a
chocolate factory until she saw my 'ad' last week and joined my show.We
gave her a rehearsal Monday and we put her on the bill next night.She's
a good looker with plenty of grit, and is a winner with the bunch in
front.""How did you get her to take the job?""Well," he replied, "she balked at the act at first, but I showed her
two violet notes from a couple of swell fairies who wanted the job, and
after that she signed for six weeks."he exclaimed dryly, and he bit the corner of his stubby
mustache and smiled."This is the last act in the olio, so you will have
to excuse me.*     *     *     *     *

There are streets and boulevards in the Quarter, sections of which are
alive with the passing throng and the traffic of carts and omnibuses.Then one will come to a long stretch of massive buildings, public
institutions, silent as convents--their interminable walls flanking
garden or court.Germain is just such a highway until it crosses the
Boulevard St.Michel--the liveliest roadway of the Quarter.Then it
seems to become suddenly inoculated with its bustle and life, and from
there on is crowded with bourgeoise and animated with the commerce of
market and shop.An Englishman once was so fired with a desire to see the gay life of the
Latin Quarter that he rented a suite of rooms on this same Boulevard St.Germain at about the middle of this long, quiet stretch.Here he stayed
a fortnight, expecting daily to see from his "chambers" the gaiety of a
Bohemia of which he had so often heard.At the end of his disappointing
sojourn, he returned to London, firmly convinced that the gay life of
the Latin Quarter was a myth.[Illustration: (crowded street market)]

But the man from Denver, the "Steel King," and the two thinner
gentlemen with the louis-lined waistcoats who accompanied him and whom
Fortune had awakened in the far West one morning and had led them to
"The Great Red Star copper mine"--a find which had ever since been a
source of endless amusement to them--discovered the Quarter before they
had been in Paris a day, and found it, too, "the best ever," as they
expressed it.They did not remain long in Paris, this rare crowd of seasoned genials,
for it was their first trip abroad and they had to see Switzerland and
Vienna, and the Rhine; but while they stayed they had a good time Every
Minute.The man from Denver and the Steel King sat at one of the small tables,
leaning over the railing at the "Bal Bullier," gazing at the sea of
dancers."Billy," said the man from Denver to the Steel King, "if they had this
in Chicago they'd tear out the posts inside of fifteen minutes"--he
wiped the perspiration from his broad forehead and pushed his
twenty-dollar Panama on the back of his head.he mused, clinching the butt of his perfecto between
his teeth.it beats all I ever see," and he chuckled to
himself, his round, genial face, with its double chin, wreathed in
smiles.he called to one of the 'copper twins,' "did you get on
to that little one in black that just went by--well!Already the pile of saucers on their table reached a foot high--a record
of refreshments for every Yvonne and Marcelle that had stopped in
passing."Certainly, sit right down," cried the Steel King."Here, Jack,"--this
to the aged garcon, "smoke up!and ask the ladies what they'll
have"--all of which was unintelligible to the two little Parisiennes and
the garcon, but quite clear in meaning to all three.interrupted the taller of the two girls, "un cafe
glace pour moi.""Et moi," answered her companion gayly, "Je prends une limonade!"thundered good-humoredly the man from Denver; "git 'em
a good drink.yes, that's it--whiskey--I see you're on,
and two.he explains, holding up two fat fingers, "all straight,
friend--two whiskeys with seltzer on the side--see?Now go roll your
hoop and git back with 'em.""Oh, non, monsieur!"cried the two Parisiennes in one breath; "whiskey!ca pique et c'est trop fort."At this juncture the flower woman arrived with a basketful of red roses."Voulez-vous des fleurs, messieurs et mesdames?""Certainly," cried the Steel King; "here, Maud and Mamie, take the lot,"
and he handed the two girls the entire contents of the basket.The
taller buried her face for a moment in the red Jaqueminots and drank in
their fragrance.When she looked up, two big tears trickled down to the
corners of her pretty mouth.The
smaller girl gave a little cry of delight and shook her roses above her
head as three other girls passed.Ten minutes later the two possessed
but a single rose apiece--they had generously given all the rest away.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

The "copper twins" had been oblivious of all this.They had been hanging
over the low balustrade, engaged in a heart-to-heart talk with two
pretty Quartier brunettes.It seemed to be really a case of love at
first sight, carried on somewhat under difficulties, for the "copper
twins" could not speak a word of French, and the English of the two chic
brunettes was limited to "Oh, yes!""Good morning," "Good
evening," and "I love you."The four held hands over the low railing,
until the "copper twins" fairly steamed in talk; warmed by the sun of
gaiety and wet by several rounds of Highland dew, they grew sad and
earnest, and got up and stepped all over the Steel King and the man from
Denver, and the two Parisiennes' daintily slippered feet, in squeezing
out past the group of round tables back of the balustrade, and down on
to the polished floor--where they are speedily lost to view in the maze
of dancers, gliding into the whirl with the two brunettes.When the
waltz is over they stroll out with them into the garden, and order wine,
and talk of changing their steamer date.The good American, with his spotless collar and his well-cut clothes,
with his frankness and whole-souled generosity, is a study to the modern
grisette.He seems strangely attractive to her, in contrast with a
certain type of Frenchman, that is selfish, unfaithful, and mean--that
jealousy makes uncompanionable and sometimes cruel.She will tell you
that these pale, black-eyed, and black-bearded boulevardiers are all
alike--lazy and selfish; so unlike many of the sterling, good fellows of
the Quarter--Frenchmen of a different stamp, and there are many of
these--rare, good Bohemians, with hearts and natures as big as all
out-doors--"bons garcons," which is only another way of saying
"gentlemen."As you tramp along back to your quarters some rainy night you find many
of the streets leading from the boulevards silent and badly lighted,
except for some flickering lantern on the corner of a long block which
sends the shadows scurrying across your path.You pass a student perhaps
and a girl, hurrying home--a fiacre for a short distance is a luxury in
the Quarter.Now you hear the click-clock of an approaching cab, the
cocher half asleep on his box.The hood of the fiacre is up, sheltering
the two inside from the rain.As the voiture rumbles by near a
street-light, you catch a glimpse of a pink silk petticoat within and a
pair of dainty, white kid shoes--and the glint of an officer's sword.Farther on, you pass a silent gendarme muffled in his night cloak; a few
doors farther on in a small cafe, a bourgeois couple, who have arrived
on a late train no doubt to spend a month with relatives in Paris, are
having a warming tipple before proceeding farther in the drizzling rain.They have, of course, invited the cocher to drink with them.They have
brought all their pets and nearly all their household goods--two dogs,
three bird-cages, their tiny occupants protected from the damp air by
several folds of newspaper; a cat in a stout paper box with air holes,
and two trunks, well tied with rope.[Illustration: (street market)]

"Ah, yes, it has been a long journey!"Her husband
corroborates her, as they explain to the patronne of the cafe and to the
cocher that they left their village at midday.Anything over two hours
on the chemin-de-fer is considered a journey by these good French
people!As you continue on to your studio, you catch a glimpse of the lights of
the Boulevard Montparnasse.Next a cab with a green light rattles by;
then a ponderous two-wheeled cart lumbers along, piled high with red
carrots as neatly arranged as cigars in a box--the driver asleep on his
seat near his swinging lantern--and the big Normandy horses taking the
way.It is late, for these carts are on their route to the early morning
market--one of the great Halles.The tired waiters are putting up the
shutters of the smaller cafes and stacking up the chairs.Now a cock
crows lustily in some neighboring yard; the majority at least of the
Latin Quarter has turned in for the night.A moment later you reach your
gate, feel instinctively for your matches.In the darkness of the court
a friendly cat rubs her head contentedly against your leg.It is the
yellow one that sleeps in the furniture factory, and you pick her up and
carry her to your studio, where, a moment later, she is crunching
gratefully the remnant of the beau maquereau left from your
dejeuner--for charity begins at home.CHAPTER X

EXILED


Scores of men, celebrated in art and in literature, have, for a longer
or shorter period of their lives, been bohemians of the Latin Quarter.And yet these years spent in cafes and in studios have not turned them
out into the world a devil-me-care lot of dreamers.They have all
marched and sung along the "Boul' Miche"; danced at the "Bullier";
starved, struggled, and lived in the romance of its life.It has all
been a part of their education, and a very important part too, in the
development of their several geniuses, a development which in later life
has placed them at the head of their professions.These years of
camaraderie--of a life free from all conventionalities, in daily touch
with everything about them, and untrammeled by public censure or the
petty views of prudish or narrow minds, have left them free to cut a
straight swath merrily toward the goal of their ideals, surrounded all
the while by an atmosphere of art and good-fellowship that permeates the
very air they breathe.If a man can work at all, he can work here, for between the
working-hours he finds a life so charming, that once having lived
it he returns to it again and again, as to an old love.How many are the romances of this student Quarter!How many hearts have
been broken or made glad!How many brave spirits have suffered and
worked on and suffered again, and at last won fame!We who come with a fresh eye know nothing of all that has passed
within these quaint streets--only those who have lived in and through it
know its full story.[Illustration: THE MUSEE CLUNY]

Pochard has seen it; so has the little old woman who once danced at the
opera; so have old Bibi La Puree, and Alphonse, the gray-haired garcon,
and Mere Gaillard, the flower-woman.They have seen the gay boulevards
and the cafes and generations of grisettes, from the true grisette of
years gone by, in her dainty white cap and simple dress turned low at
the throat, to the tailor-made grisette of to-day.Yet the eyes of the little old woman still dance; they have not grown
tired of this ever-changing kaleidoscope of human nature, this paradise
of the free, where many would rather struggle on half starved than live
a life of luxury elsewhere.I knew one once who lived in an
air-castle of his own building--a tall, serious fellow, a sculptor, who
always went tramping about in a robe resembling a monk's cowl, with his
bare feet incased in coarse sandals; only his art redeemed these
eccentricities, for he produced in steel and ivory the most exquisite
statuettes.One at the Salon was the sensation of the day--a knight in
full armor, scarcely half a foot in height, holding in his arms a nymph
in flesh-tinted ivory, whose gentle face, upturned, gazed sweetly into
the stern features behind the uplifted vizor; and all so exquisitely
carved, so alive, so human, that one could almost feel the tender heart
of this fair lady beating against the cold steel breastplate.Another "bon garcon"--a painter whose enthusiasm for his art knew no
bounds--craved to produce a masterpiece.This dreamer could be seen
daily ferreting around the Quarter for a studio always bigger than the
one he had.At last he found one that exactly fitted the requirements of
his vivid imagination--a studio with a ceiling thirty feet high, with
windows like the scenic ones next to the stage entrances of the
theaters.Here at last he could give full play to his brush--no subject
seemed too big for him to tackle; he would move in a canvas as big as a
back flat to a third act, and commence on a "Fall of Babylon" or a
"Carnage of Rome" with a nerve that was sublime!The choking dust of the
arena--the insatiable fury of the tigers--the cowering of hundreds of
unfortunate captives--and the cruel multitude above, seated in the vast
circle of the hippodrome--all these did not daunt his zeal.Once he persuaded a venerable old abbe to pose for his portrait.The
old gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at
the end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which
I dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his
clothes; the face was still in its primary drawing."The face I shall do in time," the enthusiast assured the reverend man
excitedly; "it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to
get.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put
in your boots?""Does monsieur think I am not a
very busy man?"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:

"I won't come any more, my friend.I'll send my boots around to-morrow
by my boy."But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon
one with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents
relative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,
bearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red
tags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching
departure, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge's
window.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: "Is it true, monsieur,
you are going Saturday?""Yes," I answer; "unfortunately, it is quite true."The old man sighs and replies: "I once had to leave Paris myself";
looking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident."My regiment
was ordered to the colonies.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty."The patron of the tobacco-shop,
and madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the
little street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me "bon voyage,"
accompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois
has gone to hunt for a cab--a "galerie," as it is called, with a place
for trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no "galerie" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find
one, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my
valise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel
court.The "galerie" has arrived--with the smallest of the three
daughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get
down.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come
up to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to
lose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,
headed by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search
considerably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers
and myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes
de menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the
French Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an
assuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and
chained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and
squeaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom
has been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.Lazare,
changes his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently
thinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,
as the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Just as it
reaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window."Monsieur," says the aged cocher, "it is an impossibility!I regret very
much to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate."A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and
take a look; there are at least four inches to spare on either side in
passing through the iron posts.cries my cocher enthusiastically, "monsieur is right, happily for
us!"He cracks his whip, the little horse gathers itself together--a moment
of careful driving and we are through and into the street and rumbling
away, amid cheers from the windows above.As I glance over my traps, I
see a small bunch of roses tucked in the corner of my roll of rugs with
an engraved card attached."From Mademoiselle Ernestine Valois," it
reads, and on the other side is written, in a small, fine hand, "Bon
voyage."I look back to bow my acknowledgment, but it is too late; we have turned
the corner and the rue Vaugirard is but a memory!*     *     *     *     *

But why go on telling you of what the little shops contain--how narrow
and picturesque are the small streets--how gay the boulevards--what they
do at the "Bullier"--or where they dine?It is Love that moves Paris--it
is the motive power of this big, beautiful, polished city--the love of
adventure, the love of intrigue, the love of being a bohemian if you
will--but it is Love all the same!"I work for love," hums the little couturiere."I work for love," cries the miller of Marcel Legay."I live for love," sings the poet."For the love of art I am a painter," sighs Edmond, in his atelier--"and
for her!""For the love of it I mold and model and create," chants the
sculptor--"and for her!"It is the Woman who dominates Paris--"Les petites femmes!"who have
inspired its art through the skill of these artisans.cries a poor old
woman outside of your train compartment, as you are leaving Havre for
Paris.screams a girl, running near the open window with a little
fishergirl doll uplifted.I see," cries the
pretty vendor; "but it is a boy doll--he will be sad if he goes to
Paris without a companion!"Take all the little fishergirls away from Paris--from the Quartier
Latin--and you would find chaos and a morgue!that is it--L'amour!--L'amour!--L'amour![Illustration: (burning candle)]

which actions are judged.They are the children that testify as to the
real character of their parents.God or no God, larceny is the enemy of
industry--industry is the mother of prosperity--prosperity is a good,
and therefore larceny is an evil.God or no God, murder is a crime.There has always been a law against larceny, because the laborer wishes
to enjoy the fruit of his toil.As long as men object to being killed,
murder will be illegal.I have insisted, and I still insist, that it is still impossible for
a finite man to commit a crime deserving infinite punishment; and upon
this subject Mr.Black admits that "no revelation has lifted the veil
between time and eternity;" and, consequently, neither the priest nor
the "policeman" knows anything with certainty regarding another world.He simply insists that "in shadowy figures we are warned that a very
marked distinction will be made between the good and bad in the next
world."There is "a very marked distinction" in this; but there is this
rainbow in the darkest human cloud: The worst have hope of reform.All I
insist is, if there is another life, the basest soul that finds its way
to that dark or radiant shore will have the everlasting chance of
doing right.Nothing but the most cruel ignorance, the most heartless
superstition, the most ignorant theology, ever imagined that the
few days of human life spent here, surrounded by mists and clouds of
darkness, blown over life's sea by storms and tempests of passion, fixed
for all eternity the condition of the human race.If this doctrine be
true, this life is but a net, in which Jehovah catches souls for hell.We are told that "there is no good reason to doubt that the statements
of the Evangelists, as we have them now, are genuine."The fact is, no
one knows who made the "statements of the Evangelists."There are three
important manuscripts upon which the Christian world relies."The first
appeared in the catalogue of the Vatican, in 1475.Of the New, it contains the four gospels,--the Acts, the
seven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the
Epistle to the Hebrews, so far as the fourteenth verse of the ninth
chapter,"--and nothing more."The
second, the Alexandrine, was presented to King Charles the First, in
1628.It contains the Old and New Testaments, with some exceptions;
passages are wanting in Matthew, in John, and in II.It
also contains the Epistle of Clemens Romanus, a letter of Athanasius,
and the treatise of Eusebius on the Psalms."The last is the Sinaitic
Codex, discovered about 1850, at the Convent of St."It contains the Old and New Testaments, and in addition
the entire Epistle of Barnabas, and a portion of the Shepherd of
Hennas--two books which, up to the beginning of the fourth century, were
looked upon by many as Scripture."In this manuscript, or codex, the
gospel of St.Mark concludes with the eighth verse of the sixteenth
chapter, leaving out the frightful passage: "Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature.He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."In
matters of the utmost importance these manuscripts disagree, but even if
they all agreed it would not furnish the slightest evidence of their
truth.It will not do to call the statements made in the gospels
"depositions," until it is absolutely established who made them, and the
circumstances under which they were made.Neither can we say that "they
were made in the immediate prospect of death," until we know who made
them.It is absurd to say that "the witnesses could not have been
mistaken, because the nature of the facts precluded the possibility of
any delusion about them."Can it be pretended that the witnesses could
not have been mistaken about the relation the Holy Ghost is alleged to
have sustained to Jesus Christ?Is there no possibility of delusion
about a circumstance of that kind?Did the writers of the four gospels
have "the sensible and true avouch of their own eyes and ears" in that
behalf?How was it possible for any one of the four Evangelists to know
that Christ was the Son of God, or that he was God?Matthew says that an angel of the Lord told
Joseph in a dream, but Joseph never wrote an account of this wonderful
vision.Luke tells us that the angel had a conversation with Mary, and
that Mary told Elizabeth, but Elizabeth never wrote a word.There is no
account of Mary, or Joseph, or Elizabeth, or the angel, having had any
conversation with Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, in which one word was
said about the miraculous origin of Jesus Christ.The persons who knew
did not write, so that the account is nothing but hearsay.Black pretend that such statements would be admitted as evidence in any
court?But how do we know that the disciples of Christ wrote a word of
the gospels?How do we know
that the writers of the gospels "were men of unimpeachable character?"Black's Admission

For the purpose of defending the character of his infallible God, Mr.Black is forced to defend religious intolerance, wars of extermination,
human slavery, and almost polygamy.He admits that God established
slavery; that he commanded his chosen people to buy the children of the
heathen; that heathen fathers and mothers did right to sell their girls
and boys; that God ordered the Jews to wage wars of extermination and
conquest; that it was right to kill the old and young; that God forged
manacles for the human brain; that he commanded husbands to murder their
wives for suggesting the worship of the sun or moon; and that every
cruel, savage passage in the Old Testament was inspired by him.Such is
a "policeman's" view of God.The Stars Upon the Door of France

Mr.Black justifies all the crimes and horrors, excuses all the tortures
of all the Christian years, by denouncing the cruelties of the French
Revolution.Thinking people will not hasten to admit that an infinitely
good being authorized slavery in Judea, because of the atrocities of the
French Revolution.They will remember the sufferings of the Huguenots.They will not forget
the countless cruelties of priest and king.They will not forget the
dungeons of the Bastile.They will know that the Revolution was an
effect, and that liberty was not the cause--that atheism was not the
cause.Behind the Revolution they will see altar and throne--sword and
fagot--palace and cathedral--king and priest--master and slave--tyrant
and hypocrite.They will see that the excesses, the cruelties, and
crimes were but the natural fruit of seeds the church had sown.Upon that cloud of war, black with
the myriad miseries of a thousand years, dabbled with blood of king and
queen, of patriot and priest, there was this bow: "Beneath the flag of
France all men are free."In spite of all the blood and crime, in spite
of deeds that seem insanely base, the People placed upon a Nation's brow
these stars:--Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--grander words than ever
issued from Jehovah's lips.A KIND WORD FOR JOHN CHINAMAN

On the 27th day of March, 1880, Messrs.Wright, Dickey, O'Conner, and
Murch, of the Select Committee appointed by Congress to "Consider
the causes of the present depression of labor," presented the majority
special report on Chinese Immigration.The following quotations are
excerpts from Col.R. G. Ingersoll's caustic review of that report.The Select Committee Afraid

These gentlemen are in great fear for the future of our most holy and
perfectly authenticated religion, and have, like faithful watchmen,
from the walls and towers of Zion, hastened to give the alarm.They have
informed Congress that "Joss has his temple of worship in the Chinese
quarters, in San Francisco.Within the walls of a dilapidated structure
is exposed to the view of the faithful the God of the Chinaman, and here
are his altars of worship, Here he tears up his pieces of paper; here he
offers up his prayers; here he receives his religious consolations,
and here is his road to the celestial land."That "Joss is located in a
long, narrow room, in a building in a back alley, upon a kind of altar;"
that "he is a wooden image, looking as much like an alligator as like a
human being;" that the Chinese "think there is such a place as heaven;"
that "all classes of Chinamen worship idols;" that "the temple is open
every day at all hours;" that "the Chinese have no Sunday;" that this
heathen god has "huge jaws, a big red tongue, large white teeth, a half
dozen arms, and big, fiery, eyeballs.About him are placed offerings of
meat, and other eatables--a sacrificial offering."The Gods of the Joss-House and Patmos

No wonder that these members of the committee were shocked at such a
god, knowing as they did, that the only true God was correctly described
by the inspired lunatic of Patmos in the following words: "And there sat
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of
Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps
with a golden girdle.His head and his hairs were white like wool, as
white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like
unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the
sound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out
of his mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword; and his countenance was as
the sun shining in his strength."Certainly, a large mouth, filled
with white teeth, is preferable to one used as the scabbard of a sharp,
two-edged sword.Why should these gentlemen object to a god with big
fiery eyeballs, when their own Deity has eyes like a flame of fire?A Little Too Late

Is it not a little late in the day to object to people because they
sacrifice meat and other eatables to their god?We all know, that for
thousands of years the "real" God was exceedingly fond of roasted meat;
that He loved the savor of burning flesh, and delighted in the perfume
of fresh warm blood.Christianity has a Fair Show in San Francisco

The world is also informed by these gentlemen that "the idolatry of
the Chinese produces a demoralizing effect upon our American youth by
bringing sacred things into disrespect and making religion a theme of
disgust and contempt."In San Francisco there are some three hundred
thousand people.Is it possible that a few Chinese can bring "our holy
religion" into disgust and contempt?In that city there are fifty times
as many churches as joss-houses.Scores of sermons are uttered every
week; religious books and papers are plentiful as leaves in autumn, and
somewhat dryer; thousands of bibles are within the reach of all.An Arrow from the Quiver of Satire

And there, too, is the example of a Christian city.Why should we send
missionaries to China, if we cannot convert the heathen when they come
here?When missionaries go to a foreign land the poor benighted people
have to take their word for the blessings showered upon a Christian
people; but when the heathen come here, they can see for themselves.What was simply a story becomes a demonstrated fact.They come in
contact with people who love their enemies.They see that in a Christian
land men tell the truth; that they will not take advantage of strangers;
that they are just and patient; kind and tender; and have no prejudice
on account of color, race or religion; that they look upon mankind as
brethren; that they speak of God as a Universal Father, and are
willing to work and even to suffer, for the good, not only of their own
countrymen, but of the heathen as well.All this the Chinese see and
know, and why they still cling to the religion of their country is, to
me, a matter of amazement.We Have no Religious System

I take this, the earliest opportunity, to inform these gentlemen
composing a majority of the committee, that we have in the United States
no "religious system;" that this is a secular government.That it has
no religious creed; that it does not believe nor disbelieve in a future
state of reward or punishment; that it neither affirms nor denies the
existence of a "living" God.Congress Nothing to Do with Religion

Congress has nothing to do with the religion of the people.Its members
are not responsible to God for the opinions of their constituents, and
it may tend to the happiness of the constituents for me to state that
they are in no way responsible for the religion of the members.Religion
is an individual, not a national matter.And where the nation interferes
with the right of conscience, the liberties of the people are devoured
by the monster Superstition.But I am astonished that four Christian statesmen, four members of
Congress in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, who seriously
object to people on account of their religious convictions, should
still assert that the very religion in which they believe--and the only
religion established by the living god-head of the American system--is
not adapted to the spiritual needs of one-third of the human race.It is
amazing that these four gentlemen have, in the defense of the Christian
religion, announced the discovery that it is wholly inadequate for
the civilization of mankind; that the light of the cross can never
penetrate the darkness of China; "that all the labors of the missionary,
the example of the good, the exalted character of our civilization, make
no impression upon the pagan life of the Chinese;" and that even
the report of this committee will not tend to elevate, refine and
Christianize the yellow heathen of the Pacific coast.In the name
of religion these gentlemen have denied its power and mocked at the
enthusiasm of its founder.Worse than this, they have predicted for the
Chinese a future of ignorance and idolatry in this world, and, if the
"American system" of religion is true, hell-fire in the next.Do not Trample on John Chinaman

Do not trample upon these people because they have a different
conception of things about which even this committee knows nothing.Give them the same privilege you enjoy of making a God after their own
fashion.Would you be willing
to have them remain, if one of their race, thousands of years ago, had
pretended to have seen God, and had written of him as follows: "There
went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth; coals
were kindled by it, * * * and he rode upon a cherub and did fly."Why
should you object to these people on account of their religion?Your
objection has in it the spirit of hate and intolerance.That spirit lighted the fagot, made the
thumb-screw, put chains upon the limbs, and lashes upon the backs of
men.The same spirit bought and sold, captured and kidnapped human
beings; sold babes, and justified all the horrors of slavery.Be Honest with the Chinese

If you wish to drive out the Chinese, do not make a pretext of religion.Do not pretend that you are trying to do God a favor.Injustice in his
name is doubly detestable.The assassin cannot sanctify his dagger by
falling on his knees, and it does not help a falsehood if it be uttered
as a prayer.Religion, used, to intensify the hatred of men toward men,
under the pretense of pleasing God, has cursed this world.An Honest Merchant the Best Missionary

I am almost sure that I have read somewhere that "Christ died for _all_
men," and that "God is no respecter of persons."It was once taught
that it was the duty of Christians to tell to all people the "tidings of
great joy."I have never believed these things myself, but have always
contended that an honest merchant was the best missionary.Commerce
makes friends, religion makes enemies; the one enriches, and the other
impoverishes; the one thrives best where the truth is told, the other
where falsehoods are believed.For myself, I have but little confidence
in any business, or enterprise, or investment, that promises dividends
only after the death of the stockholders.Good Words from Confucius

For the benefit of these four philosophers and prophets, I will give a
few extracts from the writings of Confucius that will, in my judgment,
compare favorably with the best passages of their report:

"My doctrine is that man must be true to the principles of his nature,
and the benevolent exercises of them toward others.""With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and with my bended arm
for a pillow, I still have joy.""Riches and honor acquired by injustice are to me but floating clouds.""The man who, in view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who, in view of
danger, forgets life; and who remembers an old agreement, however far
back it extends, such a man may be reckoned a complete man.""Recompense injury with justice, and kindness with kindness."There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's
life: Reciprocity is that word.The Ancient Chinese

When the ancestors of the four Christian Congressmen were barbarians,
when they lived in caves, gnawed bones, and worshiped dry snakes; the
infamous Chinese were reading these sublime sentences of Confucius.When
the forefathers of these Christian statesmen were hunting toads to
get the jewels out of their heads to be used as charms, the wretched
Chinamen were calculating eclipses, and measuring the circumference
of the earth.When the progenitors of these representatives of the
"American system of religion" were burning women charged with nursing
devils, these people "incapable of being influenced by the exalted
character of our civilization," were building asylums for the insane.The Chinese and Civil Service Reform

Neither should it be forgotten that, for thousands of years, the Chinese
have honestly practised the great principle known as civil service
reform--a something that even the administration of Mr.Hayes has
reached only through the proxy of promise.Invading China in the Name of Opium and Christ

The English battered down the door of China in the names of Opium and
Christ.This infamy was regarded as another triumph of the gospel.At last in self-defense the Chinese allowed Christians to touch their
shores.Their wise men, their philosophers, protested, and prophesied
that time would show that Christians could not be trusted.This re port
proves that the wise men were not only philosophers but prophets.Don't be Dishonest in the Name of God

Treat China as you would England.Change it if you will, according to the laws of nations, but on no
account excuse a breach of national faith by pretending that we are
dishonest for God's sake.CONCERNING CREEDS AND THE TYRANNY OF SECTS




482.Diversity of Opinion Abolished by Henry VIII

In the reign of Henry VIII--that pious and moral founder of the
apostolic Episcopal Church,--there was passed by the parliament
of England an act entitled, "An act for abolishing of diversity of
opinion."And in this act was set forth what a good Christian was
obliged to believe:

First, That in the sacrament was the real body and blood of Jesus
Christ.Second, That the body and blood of Jesus Christ was in the bread, and
the blood and body of Jesus Christ was in the wine.Fourth, That vows of chastity were of perpetual obligation.Fifth, That private masses ought to be continued; and,

Sixth, That auricular confession to a priest must be maintained.This creed was made by law, in order that all men might know just what
to believe by simply reading the statute.The Church hated to see the
people wearing out their brains in thinking upon these subjects.Spencer and Darwin Damned

According to the philosophy of theology, man has continued to degenerate
for six thousand years.To teach that there is that in nature which
impels to higher forms and grander ends, is heresy, of course.The
Deity will damn Spencer and his "Evolution," Darwin and his "Origin
of Species," Bastian and his "Spontaneous Generation," Huxley and his
"Protoplasm," Tyndall and his "Prayer Gauge," and will save those, and
those only, who declare that the universe has been cursed, from the
smallest atom to the grandest star; that everything tends to evil and to
that only, and that the only perfect thing in nature is the Presbyterian
Confession of Faith.The Dead do Not Persecute

Imagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The
end that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are
orthodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated
church.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,
side by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this
difference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois

The supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that
an unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not
be allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have
been murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other
witnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He
was liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to
contribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges
who decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any
court.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption
of the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored
to chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot

Now and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,
and has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious
get together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most
prophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the
tree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students

Thousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various
Churches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate
the phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only
object, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may
learn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in
the dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus
trained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,
he is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly
impossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you
think the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it
wrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,
that most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of
fear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy

A trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in
the Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it
still thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined
to prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are
shambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that
the Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with
force.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be
bound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and
dungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening

Fortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon
the Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and
sciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,
succumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,
but by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a
relic of the past.The cry of "heresy" has been growing fainter and
fainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination
have ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of
infants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist "Hoist with his own Petard."A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a
piece of friendly advice."Although you may disbelieve the bible," said
he, "you ought not to say so."Do
you believe the bible," said I. He replied, "Most assuredly."To which
I retorted, "Your answer conveys no information to me.You may be
following your own advice.Of
course a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be
particular about telling the truth himself."The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity

What a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human
heart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and
great were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother
bears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of
the natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;
that for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to
heaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling
in the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy

Whoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be
guilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name
given by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of
the hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and
who, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of
intellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet
used in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian
era, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment
inflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This
effort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the
salvation of the soul.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as
certainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They
do not say, "we _think_ this is so," but "we _know_ this is so."They do
not appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They
keep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing
has been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the
authority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly
sin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation
of superstition has always horrified the Church.By some unaccountable
infatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense
importance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will
forever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts
or denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.To practice
justice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some
incomprehensible creed.You must say, "Once one is three, and three
times one is one."The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to
believe, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church
as a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago

One hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have
perished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in
England, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves
in the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their
ears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads
branded.The Despotism of Faith

The despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian
countries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time
the same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,
in Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the
world, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the
assumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware

And what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says
a heretic, "Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your
children cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I
will hunt you to the very portals of the grave."Calvin's Petrified Heart

Luther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor
of his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified
heart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly
declared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the
founders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous
tenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily
inconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion
as to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Common sense
belongs exclusively to no tongue.Logic is not confined to, nor has it
been buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is
translated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue
of Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: "O Jupiter!He then added: "Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven
again, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you
were prostrate."The Tail of a Lion

There is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the
tail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think
and act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they
join something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party
can act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to
pay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself
about the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept

The fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The
fall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began
to have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the
congregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories
themselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short
of irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside
world was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while
the church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress

Christianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human
race.Across the highway of progress it has always been building
breastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,
dogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered
together behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of
malice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into
a deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
crowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of
hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you
will not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to
smilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not
been found.The Real Eden is Beyond

Nations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy
becomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the
years sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are
behind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for
knowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,
it will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men

Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,
Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and
women.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All
other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
given up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS




507.On which of the six days was he
created?Is it possible that God would make a successful
rival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what
a snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced
woman.He knew that if the serpent
got into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive
them out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he
himself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be
good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman
was a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to
take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it
not possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these
fables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God
take him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam
and Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not
acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's
reputation.Questions About the Ark

How was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what
was done with the filth?How were some
portions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others
kept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their
respective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,
and they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things
must have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept
up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the
slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the
plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate
rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and
so sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon
their health.Of course, all the polar
bears did not go.It could be confounded only by the
destruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at
that time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain
presiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak
the words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch
the brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in
the machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the
language of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man
to be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in
the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take
myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a
holy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,
candlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,
at the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put
any of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,
the Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,
that whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off
from his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot
believe it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
are?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
earth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters
happen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of
others?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a
legal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an
altar?Were the
stealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and
eloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these
things; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who
will burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who
burns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the
investigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,
laugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase
or decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an
eternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has
not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
entitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat
this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG

I do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the
clouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,
soil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every
heretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast
out and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give
his individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really
valuable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or
State solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically
we are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect
minds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give
up your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory
of reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,
the ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:
"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of
man."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,
but after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of
men and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the
human heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only
justice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the
same as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been
wet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne
have leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated
to excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his
existence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the
conditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what
would have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen
is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all
religions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our
right to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his
intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this
sense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own
in which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all
the gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;
they have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think
a man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long
time.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike
ourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than
servile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt
to ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any
time, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from
human speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of
the Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too
much thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the
sword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition
Science has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality
enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one
who had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the
moon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church.""On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and
success.INGERSOLL'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE

     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother
     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs
     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our
     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish
     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would
do for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were
falling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest
point; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,
using his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that
kisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured
with the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour
of all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a
sunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther
shore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every
life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment
jeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep
and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but
in the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic
souls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to
tears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly
gave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully
discharged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand
times I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a
temple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only
good, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only
religion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;
and were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom
to his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet
flowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,
and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless
lips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the
return of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that
these dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,
to do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR

     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were
     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran
     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the
great struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the
music of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We
see thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see
the pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those
assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the
great army of freedom.Some are
walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they
adore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as
they lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing
babes that are asleep.Some are parting with
mothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,
and say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand
waves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,
keeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the
great cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the
fields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory
fields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand
guard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with
them in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are
with them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,
the life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them
pierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in
the whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech
can never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden
in the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man
bowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
governed by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the
strokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through
tangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the
sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
brutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner
of the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting
shell.Instead of
slaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches
the auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see
homes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want
and crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They
are at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag
they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the
tearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of
the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less
palace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In
the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of
death.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for
the living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by
vermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother
of all abominations, the devil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva

The Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought

Prejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the
home.I believe in truth, in
investigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and
intelligence."Can't leave now," snapped Gilly."I'll be along, tell her--"

"Had she better go alone?"The other swept a fretful eye about the company."But this business begins to look urgent.--Here, somebody we can spare.You go, Hackh, there's a good chap."Chantel dropped the helmet he had caught up.Bowing stiffly, Rudolph
marched across the room and down the stairs.His face, pale at the late
spectacle, had grown red and sulky, "Can spare me, can you?--I'm the
one."Viewing himself thus, morosely, as rejected of men, he reached the
compound gate to fare no better with the woman.She stood waiting in the
shadow of the wall; and as he drew unwillingly near, the sight of
her--to his shame and quick dismay--made his heart leap in welcome.She
wore the coolest and severest white, but at her throat the same small
furbelow, every line of which he had known aboard ship, in the days of
his first exile and of his recent youth.It was now as though that youth
came flooding back to greet her.He forgot everything, except that for a few priceless
moments they would be walking side by side.She faced him with a start, never so young and beautiful as now--her
blue eyes wide, scornful, and blazing, her cheeks red and lips
trembling, like a child ready to cry."I did not want _you_" she said curtly.Pride forged the retort for him, at a blow.He explained
in the barest of terms, while she eyed him steadily, with every sign of
rising temper."I can spare you, too," she whipped out; then turned to walk away,
holding her helmet erect, in the poise of a young goddess, pert
but warlike.In two strides, however, he
had overtaken her."I am under orders," he stated grimly.Her pace gradually slackened in the growing heat; but she went forward
with her eyes fixed on the littered, sunken flags of their path.This
rankling silence seemed to him more unaccountable and deadly than all
former mischances, and left him far more alone.From the sultry tops of
bamboos, drooping like plants in an oven, an amorous multitude of
cicadas maintained the buzzing torment of steel on emery wheels, as
though the universal heat had chafed and fretted itself into a dry,
feverish utterance.Forrester looked about, quick and angry,
like one ready to choke that endless voice.But for the rest, the two
strange companions moved steadily onward.In an alley of checkered light a buffalo with a wicker nose-ring, and
heavy, sagging horns that seemed to jerk his head back in agony, heaved
toward them, ridden by a naked yellow infant in a nest-like saddle of
green fodder.Scenting with fright the disgusting presence of white
aliens, the sleep-walking monster shied, opened his eyes, and lowered
his blue muzzle as if to charge.said Rudolph, and catching the woman roughly about the
shoulders, thrust her behind him.She clutched him tightly by the
wounded arm.The buffalo stared irresolute, with evil eyes.The naked boy in the
green nest brushed a swarm of flies from his handful of sticky
sweetmeats, looked up, pounded the clumsy shoulders, and shrilled a
command.Staring doubtfully, and trembling, the buffalo swayed past, the
wrinkled armor of his gray hide plastered with dry mud as with yellow
ochre.To the slow click of hoofs, the surly monster, guided by a little
child, went swinging down the pastoral shade,--ancient yet living shapes
from a picture immemorial in art and poetry."Please," begged Rudolph, trying with his left hand to loosen her grip.For a second they stood close, their fingers interlacing.With a touch
of contempt, he found that she still trembled, and drew short breath.She tore her hand loose, as though burned.It _was_
all true, then.She caught aside her skirts angrily, and started forward in all her
former disdain.But this, after their brief alliance, was not to be
tolerated.If anybody
has a right--"

After several paces, she flashed about at him in a whirl of words:--

"All alike, every one of you!And I was fool enough to think you were
different!"The conflict in her eyes showed real, beyond suspicion.And you dare talk of rights, and
come following me here--"

"Lucky I did," retorted Rudolph, with sudden spirit; and holding out his
wounded arm, indignantly: "That scratch, if you know how it came--"

"I know, perfectly."She stared as at some crowning impudence.You came off cheaply.--I know all you said.But the one
thing I'll never understand, is where you found the courage, after he
struck you, at the club.You'll always have _that_ to admire!""After he struck"--A light broke in on Rudolph, somehow.she called, in a strangely altered voice, which brought
him up short.He explained, sulkily at first, but ending in a kind of generous rage."So I couldn't even stand up to him.And except for Maurice Heywood--Oh,
you need not frown; he's the best friend I ever had."Forrester had walked on, with the same cloudy aspect, the same
light, impatient step.He felt the greater surprise when, suddenly
turning, she raised toward him her odd, enticing, pointed face, and the
friendly mischief of her eyes.she echoed, in the same half-whisper as when she had
flattered him, that afternoon in the dusky well of the pagoda stairway.she cried, with a bewildering laugh, of
delight and pride."I hate people all prim and circumspect, and
you--You'd have flown back there straight at him, before my--before all
the others.That's why I like you so!--But you must leave that horrid,
lying fellow to me."All unaware, she had led him along the blinding white wall of the
Forrester compound, and halted in the hot shadow that lay under the
tiled gateway.As though timidly, her hand stole up and rested on
his forearm.The confined space, narrow and covered, gave to her voice a
plaintive ring."That's twice you protected me, and I hurt you.--You
_are_ different.When you
did--that, for me, yesterday, didn't it seem different and rather
splendid, and--like a book?""It seemed nonsense," replied Rudolph, sturdily.She laughed again, and at close range watched him from under consciously
drooping lashes that almost veiled a liquid brilliancy.Everywhere the
cicadas kept the heat vibrating with their strident buzz.It recalled
some other widespread mist of treble music, long ago.The trilling of
frogs, that had been, before."You dear, brave boy," she said slowly.Do you know what I'd like--Oh, there's the _amah!"_

She drew back, with an impatient gesture.Earle's waiting for me.--I hate to leave you."The stealthy brightness of her admiration changed to a slow, inscrutable
appeal.And with an
instant, bold, and tantalizing grimace, she had vanished within.*       *       *       *       *

To his homeward march, her cicadas shrilled the music of fifes.He, the
despised, the man to spare, now cocked up his helmet like fortune's
minion, dizzy with new honors.And now she, she of all the world, had spoken words which he feared and
longed to believe, and which even said still less than her searching and
mysterious look.On the top of his exultation, he reached the nunnery, and entered his
big, bare living-room, to find Heywood stretched in a wicker chair.I've asked myself to tiffin," drawled the lounger, from a
little tempest of blue smoke, tossed by the punkah."How's the fair
Bertha?--Mausers all right?And by the way, did you make that inventory
of provisions?"Rudolph faced him with a sudden conviction of guilt, of treachery to a
leader."Yes," he stammered; "I--I'll get it for you."He passed into his bedroom, caught up the written list from a table, and
for a moment stood as if dreaming.Before him the Mausers, polished and
orderly, shone in their new rack against the lime-coated wall.Though
appearing to scan them, Rudolph saw nothing but his inward confusion."After all this man did for me," he mused.What had loosed the bond,
swept away all the effects?An imp in white and red livery,
Peng, the little billiard-marker from the club, stood hurling things
violently into the outer glare.Some small but heavy object clattered on the floor.The urchin stooped,
snatched it up, and flung it hurtling clean over the garden to the
river.A boat-coolie, he
explained, had called this house bad names.Rudolph flicked a riding-whip at the
scampering legs, as the small defender of his honor bolted for
the stairs.From the road, below, a gleeful voice piped:--

"Goat-men!In the noon blaze, Peng skipped derisively, jeered at them, performed a
brief but indecorous pantomime, and then, kicking up his heels with joy,
scurried for his life."Chucked his billet," said Heywood, without surprise."Little devil, I
always thought--What's missing?"Rudolph scanned his meagre belongings, rummaged his dressing-table,
opened a wardrobe."A boat-coolie--"

But Heywood had darted to the rack of Mausers, knelt, and sprung up,
raging.Man," he cried, in a voice that made Rudolph jump,--"man,
why didn't you stop him?The side-bolts, all but two.--Young heathen,
he's crippled us: one pair of rifles left."CHAPTER XIV


OFF DUTY

The last of the sunlight streamed level through a gap in the western
ridges.It melted, with sinuous, tender shadows, the dry contour of
field and knoll, and poured over all the parching land a liquid,
undulating grace.Like the shadow of clouds on ripe corn, the red tiles
of the village roofs patched the countryside.From the distant sea had
come a breath of air, cool enough to be felt with gratitude, yet so
faint as neither to disturb the dry pulsation of myriad insect-voices,
nor to blur the square mirrors of distant rice-fields, still tropically
blue or icy with reflected clouds.Miss Drake paused on the knoll, and looked about her."This remains the same, doesn't it, for all our troubles?"she said;
then to herself, slowly, "'It is a beauteous evening, calm and free.'"Heywood made no pretense of following her look."'Dear Nun,'" he blurted; "no, how does it go again?--'dear child, that
walkest with me here--'"

The girl started down the <DW72>, with the impatience of one whose mood
is frustrated.The climate had robbed her cheeks of much color, but not,
it seemed, of all."Your fault," said Heywood, impenitent.She laughed, as though glad of this turn.Go on, please, where we left off.Heywood's smile, half earnest, half mischievous, obediently faded.Why, then, of course, I discharged Rudolph's gatekeeper, put
a trusty of my own in his place, sent out to hire a diver, and turned
all hands to hunting.'Obviously,' as Gilly would say.--We picked up two
side-bolts in the garden, by the wall, one in the mud outside, and three
the diver got in shallow water.Total recovered, six; plus two Peng had
no time for, eight.We can ill spare four guns, though; and the affair
shows they keep a beastly close watch.""Yes," said Miss Drake, absently; then drew a slow breath."Peng was the
most promising pupil we had.""He was," stated her companion, "a little, unmitigated, skipping,
orange-tawny goblin!"As they footed slowly along the winding path,
Flounce, the fox-terrier, who had scouted among strange clumps of
bamboo, now rejoined them briskly, cantering with her fore-legs
delicately stiff and joyful.Miss Drake stooped to pat her, saying:--

"Poor little dog.She rose with a sigh, to add
incongruously, "Oh, the things we dream beforehand, and then the things
that happen!"The jealous terrier scored her dusty paws down his white drill, from
knee to ankle, before he added:--

"You know how the Queen of Heaven won her divinity.""Another," said the girl, "of your heathen stories?""Rather a pretty one," he retorted."It happened in a seaport, a good
many hundred miles up the coast.A poor girl lived there, with her
mother, in a hut.One night a great gale blew, so that everybody was
anxious.Three junks were out somewhere at sea, in that storm.Her sweetheart on board, it would be in a Western
story; but these were only her friends, and kin, and townsmen, that were
at stake.So she lay there in the hut, you see, and couldn't rest.And
then it seemed to her, in the dark, that she was swimming out through
the storm, out and out, and not in the least afraid.She had become
larger, and more powerful, somehow, than the rain, or the dark, or the
whole ocean; for when she came upon the junks tossing there, she took
one in each hand, the third in her mouth, and began to swim for home.But then across the storm she heard her
mother calling in the dark, and had to open her mouth to answer."Well, then her spirit was back in the hut.But next day the two junks
came in; the third one, never.And for that dream, she was made, after
her death, the great and merciful Queen of Heaven."As Heywood ended, they were entering a pastoral village, near the town,
but hidden low under great trees, ancient and widely gnarled."You told that," said Miss Drake, "as though it had really happened.""If you believe, these things have reality; if not, they have none."His
gesture, as he repeated the native maxim, committed him to neither side."Her dream was play, compared to--some.""That," he answered, "is abominably true."The curt, significant tone made her glance at him quickly.In her dark
eyes there was no impatience, but only trouble."We do better," she said, "when we are both busy."He nodded, as though reluctantly agreeing, not so much to the words as
to the silence which followed.The evening peace, which lay on the fields and hills, had flooded even
the village streets.Without pause, without haste, the endless labor of
the day went on as quiet as a summer cloud.Meeting or overtaking,
coolies passed in single file, their bare feet slapping the enormous
flags of antique, sunken granite, their twin baskets bobbing and
creaking to the rhythm of their wincing trot.The yellow muscles rippled
strongly over straining ribs, as with serious faces, and slant eyes
intent on their path, they chanted in pairs the ageless refrain, the
call and answer which make burdens lighter:--


"O heh!--O ha?From hidden places sounded the whir of a jade-cutter's wheel, a
cobbler's rattle, or the clanging music of a forge.Yet everywhere the
slow movements, the faded, tranquil colors,--dull blue garments, dusky
red tiles, deep bronze-green foliage overhanging a vista of subdued
white and gray,--consorted with the spindling shadows and low-streaming
vesper light.Keepers of humble shops lounged in the open air with their
gossips, smoking bright pipes of the Yunnan white copper, nodding and
blinking gravely.Above them, no less courteous and placid, little
doorway shrines besought the Earth-God to lead the Giver of Wealth
within.Sometimes, where a narrow lane gaped opposite a door, small
stone lions sat grinning upon pillars, to scare away the Secret Arrow of
misfortune.But these rarely: the village seemed a happy place, favored
of the Influences.In the grateful coolness men came and went, buying,
joking, offering neighborly advice to chance-met people.A plump woman, who carried two tiny silver fish in an immense flat
basket, grinned at Miss Drake, and pointed roguishly."Her feet are bigger than my
Golden Lilies!"And laughing, she wriggled her own dusty toes, strong,
free, and perfect in modeling.An old, withered barber looked up from shaving a blue forehead, under a
tree."Their women," he growled, "are shameless, and walk everywhere!"But a stern man, bearing a palm-leaf fan and a lark in a cage, frowned
him down."She brought my son safe out of the Three Sicknesses," he declared."Mind your trade, Catcher of Lively Ones!"Then bending over the cage,
with solicitude, he began gently to fan the lark.As Heywood and the
girl paused beside him, he glanced up, and smiled gravely."I give my
pet his airing," he said; and then, quickly but quietly, "When you reach
the town, do not pass through the West Quarter.It is full of
evil-minded persons.A shrill trio of naked boys came racing and squabbling, to offer
grasshoppers for sale."We have seen no placards," replied Heywood."You will to-morrow," said the owner of the lark, calmly; and squatting,
became engrossed in poking a grasshopper between the brown, varnished
splints of the cage."Maker of Music, here is your evening rice."The two companions passed on, with Flounce timidly at heel.Now please, won't
you listen to my advice?No telling when the next ship _will_ call, but
when it does--"

"I can't run away."She spoke as one clinging to a former answer."I
must stand by my dream, such as it used to be--and even such as it is."He eyed her sadly, shook his head, and said no more.For a moment they
halted, where the path broadened on a market-place, part shade, part
luminous with golden dust.A squad of lank boys, kicking miraculously
with flat upturned soles, kept a wicker ball shining in the air, as true
and lively as a plaything on a fountain-jet.Beyond, their tiny juniors,
girls and boys knee-high, and fat tumbling babies in rainbow finery, all
hand-locked and singing, turned their circle inside out and back again,
in the dizzy graces of the "Water Wheel."Other boys, and girls still
trousered and queued like boys, played at hopscotch, in and out among
shoes that lay across the road.All traffic, even the steady trotting
coolies, fetched a lenient compass roundabout.Allow me to pass," begged a coffin-maker's man,
bent under a plank.called another, blocked by the hop-scotch.He was a
brown grass-cutter, who grinned, and fondled a smoky cloth that
buzzed--some tribe of wild bees, captured far afield.He came through safely; for at the same moment the musical "Cling-clank"
of a sweetmeat-seller's bell turned the game into a race.The way was
clear, also, for a tiny, aged collector of paper, flying the gay flag of
an "Exalted Literary Society," and plodding, between two great baskets,
on his pious rounds."Revere and spare," he piped, at intervals,--
"revere and spare the Written Word!"All the bright picture lingered with the two alien wayfarers, long after
they had passed and the sun had withdrawn from their path.In the hoary
peace of twilight,--

"What can _we_ do here?""There--I never meant
to say it.But it runs in my head all the time.I work and work, to keep
it down.Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Heywood watched her face, set straight before them, and now more clearly
cut in the failing light.Were there only pride in those fine and
resolute lines, it might have been a face from some splendid coin, or
medal of victory."Think, instead, of all the good--"

But at that she seemed to wince.As if there weren't dark streets and crooked children at
home!Oh, the pride and ignorance that sent me here!"She spoke quietly,
with a kind of wonder."Just blind, ignorant feelings, I took them
for--for something too great and mysterious.It's all very strange to
look back on, and try to put into words.I remember painted glass, and
solemn music--and thinking--then!--that I knew this lovely and terrible
world--and its Maker and Master."She looked down the dusky lanes,
where glowworm lanterns began to bob and wink.where you
see the days running into years!""The Dragon's a wise old beast," he ventured.She assented gravely:--

"And in those days I thought it was a dark continent--of lost souls.""There are no dark continents," declared Heywood suddenly, in a broken
voice."The heart of one man--can hold more darkness--You would never
see into it--"

"Don't!"They stood close in the dusk, and a tremor, a wave, passed through them
both."I forgot--I couldn't help"--he stammered; then, as they stumbled
forward, he regained his former tone, keen and ready."Mustn't get to
fussing about our work, must we?--Curious thing: speaking of dreams, you
know.The other night I thought you were somewhere out on board a junk,
and Flounce with you.I swam like anything, miles and miles, but
couldn't get out to you.Worked like steam, and no headway.Flounce knew
I was coming, but you didn't.She laughed, as though they had walked past some danger."And speaking of dragons," she rejoined.The man in
the story, that dipped in dragon's blood, was made invulnerable."German, wasn't he?--Pity
they didn't pop Rudie Hackh in!"Her swift upward glance might have been admiration, if she had not
said:--

"Your mind works very slowly."Again he paused, as though somewhat hurt; then answered
cheerfully: "Dare say.Thought at first you meant the
rattan-juice kind, from Sumatra."From the streets glimmered a few
lanterns, like candles in a long cave.But shunning these unfriendly
corridors, he led her roundabout, now along the walls, now through the
dim ways of an outlying hamlet.A prolonged shriek of growing fright and
anguish came slowly toward them--the cry of a wheelbarrow carrying the
great carcass of a pig, waxy white and waxy red, like an image from a
chamber of horrors.In the blue twilight, fast deepening, the most
familiar things became grotesque.A woman's voice telling stories behind
shadow pictures, and the capricious play of the black puppets on her
lighted screen, had the effect of incantation.Before the booth of a
dentist, the long strings of black teeth swayed in the lantern-glow,
rattling, like horrid necklaces of cannibals.And from a squat
den--where on a translucent placard in the dull window flickered the
words "Foreign Earth," and the guttering door-lantern hinted "As You
Like It"--there came a sweet, insidious, potent smell that seemed more
poisonous than mere opium."Let's go faster," said the girl."Somehow, the dark makes me uneasy
to-night."Skirting the town, they struck at last the open road beyond, and saw
against a fading sky the low black bulk of the nunnery, pierced with
orange squares.Past its landward wall, lanterns moved slowly, clustered
here and there by twos and threes, and dispersed.Cackling argument came
from the ditch, wherever the lantern-bearers halted; and on the face of
the wall, among elbowing shadows, shone dim strips of scarlet.Both
pillars of the gate were plastered with them.Lighting match
from match, he studied the long red scrolls, crowded with neat rows of
symbols.'The Garden of the Three Exquisites.'--Pshaw!that's a theatre notice:
enterprising manager.--Ah, more like it.Long preamble, regular
trimetrical platitudes--here we are:--

"'These Red-Bristled Ghosts teach their dupes to break the ancestral
tablets, and to worship the picture of a naked infant, which points one
finger toward heaven, another toward earth.--To each man entering the
False Religion, a pill is given which confuses and darkens the
mind.--Why they dig out babies' eyes: from one hundred pounds of Chinese
lead can be extracted seven pounds of silver, and the remaining
ninety-three pounds can be sold at the original cost.This silver can be
extracted only by the elixir of black eyes.The green eyes of barbarians
are of no use.'--Really, what follows is too--er--obscure.But here's
the close: 'Tao-tais of the villages, assemble your population.Let us hurl back these wizard-beasts beyond the oceans,
to take their place among the strange things of creation!'""And the big characters," she added, "the big characters you tried to
hide, are 'Kill' and 'Burn'?"Gray eyes and dark eyes met steadily, while the last match, reddening
the blood in his fingers, slowly burned out.CHAPTER XV


KAU FAI

At the top of the nunnery stairs, Rudolph met them with awkward
ceremony, and with that smiling air of encouragement which a nurse might
use in trying cheerfully to deceive a sick man.Heywood laughed, without
mercy, at this pious fraud."Hallo, you Red-Bristled Ghost!""We came early--straight from
our walk.Their host, carried by assault, at once became less mournful."The cook is here," he replied, "by the kitchen-sounds."Good," said his friend; and then whispering, as they followed Miss
Drake to the living-room, "I say, don't act as though you expected the
ghost of Banquo."In the bare, white loft, by candle-light, Sturgeon sat midway in some
long and wheezy tale, to which the padre and his wife listened with true
forbearance.Greetings over, the stodgy annalist continued.The story
was forgotten as soon as ended; talk languished; and even by the quaking
light of the candles, it was plain that the silence was no mere waiting
solemnity before meat, but a period of tension.Up from the road sounded a hubbub of voices, the
tramp of feet, and loud halloos.cried Sturgeon, like a man who fears the worst; and for all
his bulk, he was first at the window.A straggling file of lanterns, borne by some small army, came jogging
and crowding to a halt under the walls.Yellow faces gleamed faintly,
bare heads bobbed, and men set down burdens, grunting.Among the
vanguard an angry voice scolded in a strange tongue."_Burra suar!_" it
raged; then hailed imperiously, "_Ko hai?_"

Where the lanterns clustered brightest, an active little figure in white
waved a helmet, crying,--

"On deck!"I'm up here," called that young man.For reply, the stranger began to skip among his cohorts, jerking out his
white legs like a dancing marionette.Then, with a sudden drop-kick, he
sent the helmet flickering high into the darkness over the wall.The squabbling
retinue surged after him through the gate, and one by one the lanterns
disappeared under the covered way.All stared; for Captain Kneebone, after one historically brief and
outspoken visit, had never in all these years set foot in the port.The
two young men hurried to the stairs.Chinamen and lanterns crowded the courtyard, stuffed the passage, and
still came straggling in at the gate.By the noise and clatter, it might
have been a caravan, or a band of half-naked robbers bringing plunder.Everywhere, on the stone flags, coolies were dumping down bundles,
boxes, jute-bags crammed with heavy objects.Among them, still brawling
in bad Hindustani, the little captain gave his orders.At sight of
Heywood, however, he began once more to caper, with extravagant
grimaces.By his smooth, ruddy face, and tunic of purest white, he
seemed a runaway parson gone farther wrong than ever.he cried; and dancing up, caught Heywood's
hands and whirled him about."I was fair bursting to see ye, my boy!Though his cheeks were flushed, and eyes alarmingly bright, he was
beyond question sober.Over his head, Heywood and Rudolph exchanged an
anxious glance.but this is Hackh's house--the nunnery," said the one; and the
other added, "You're just in time for dinner."He clapped Rudolph on
the arm, and crowed:--

"Nunnery?We'll make it a bloomin' chummery!--Dinner be 'anged!What's more, I've brought the chow"--he swept the huddled boxes
with a prodigal gesture,--"lashin's o' food and drink!That's what it
is: a banquet!"He turned again to his sweating followers, and flung the head coolie a
handful of silver, crying, "_Sub-log kiswasti!_ Divide, and be off with
ye!I'll not spend it all on
_you_!"Then, pouncing on the nearest crate, he burst it open with a
ferocious kick.The choicest to be 'ad in all Saigong!Look
here"--He held up a tin and scanned the label triumphantly: "Chow de
Bruxelles, what?Never saw chow spelt with an 'x' before, did ye?Bad spellers, but good cooks, are the French."Something had happened,--evidently at
Calcutta, for the captain always picked up his vernacular where he
dropped his latest cargo; but at all events these vagaries were not the
effect of heat or loneliness.But now that the coolies had gone, Captain Kneebone's heels were busy,
staving open boxes right and left.A bottle rolled out, and smashed in a
hissing froth of champagne."Plenty more," he cried, rejoicing."That shows ye how much _I_ care!Suddenly he turned from this destruction, and facing Heywood,
began mysteriously to exult over him.'That cock won't fight,' says you.'Let it alone.'--Ho-ho!The eyes of his young friend widened in unbelief."No," he cried, with a start: "you haven't?"The captain seized both hands again, and took on--for his height--a
Roman stateliness.We'll--be-George, we'll announce it, at the banquet!First time in _my_ life: announce!"Heywood suddenly collapsed on a sack, and laughed himself into abject
silence."Awfully glad, old chap," he at last contrived to say, and again
choked.The captain looked down at the shaking body with a singular,
benign, and fatherly smile."I've known this boy a
long time," he explained to Rudolph."This matter's--We'll let you in,
presently.Lend me some coolies here, while we turn your dinner into my
banquet.With a seafaring bellow, he helped Rudolph to hail the servants'
quarters.A pair of cooks, a pair of Number Twos, and all the
"learn-pidgin" youngsters of two households came shuffling into the
court; and arriving guests found all hands broaching cargo, in a loud
confusion of orders and miscomprehension.Throughout the long, white
room, in the slow breeze of the punkah, scores of candles burned soft
and tremulous, as though the old days had returned when the brown
sisters lighted their refectory; but never had their table seen such
profusion of viands, or of talk and laughter.The Saigon stores--after
daily fare--seemed of a strange and Corinthian luxury.And his ruddy little face, beaming at the head of
the table, wore an extravagant, infectious grin.His quick blue eyes
danced with the light of some ineffable joke.He seemed a conjurer,
creating banquets for sheer mischief in the wilderness.Stick a knife
into the tin, and she 'eats 'erself!"Among all the revelers, one face alone showed melancholy.Chantel, at
the foot of the table, sat unregarded by all save Rudolph, who now and
then caught from him a look filled with gloom and suspicion.Forrester laughed and chattered, calling all
eyes toward her, and yet finding private intervals in which to dart a
sidelong shaft at her neighbor.Rudolph's ears shone coral pink; for now
again he was aboard ship, hiding a secret at once dizzy, dangerous, and
entrancing.Across the talk, the wine, the many lights, came the triumph
of seeing that other hostile face, glowering in defeat.Never before had
Chantel, and all the others, dwindled so far into such nonentity, or her
presence vibrated so near.Soon he became aware that Captain Kneebone had risen, with a face
glowing red above the candles.Even Sturgeon forgot the flood of
bounties, and looked expectantly toward their source.The captain
cleared his throat, faltered, then turning sheepish all at once,
hung his head."Be 'anged, I can't make a speech, after all," he grumbled; and
wheeling suddenly on Heywood, with a peevish air of having been
defrauded: "Aboard ship I could sit and think up no end o' flowery talk,
and now it's all gone!"It was Miss Drake who came to his
rescue."How do you manage all these nice
things?"The captain's eyes surveyed the motley collection down the length of the
bright table, then returned to her, gratefully:--

"This ain't anything.Only a little--bloomin'--"

"Impromptu," suggested Heywood.Captain Kneebone eyed them both with uncommon favor.I just 'opped about Saigong like a--jackdaw,
picking up these impromptus.But I came here all the way to break the
news proper, by word o' mouth."He faced the company, and gathering himself for the effort,--

"I'm rich," he declared."I'm da--I'm remarkable rich."Pausing for the effect, he warmed to his oratory.Sailormen as a rule are bad hands to save
money.But I've won first prize in the Derby Sweepstake Lott'ry, and the
money's safe to my credit at the H.K.and S. in Calcutta, and I'm
retired and going Home!More money than the old Kut Sing earned since
her launching--so much I was frightened, first, and lost my sleep!And
me without chick nor child, as the saying is--to go Home and live
luxurious ever after!"cried Nesbit, "lucky beggar!"And a volley of compliments went round the board.The captain
plainly took heart, and flushing still redder at so much praise and good
will, stood now at ease, chuckling."Most men," he began, when there came a lull, "most men makes a will
after they're dead.That's a shore way o' doing things!Now _I_ want to
see the effects, living.So be 'anged, here goes, right and proper.To
Miss Drake, for her hospital and kiddies, two thousand rupees."In the laughter and friendly uproar, the girl sat dazed.she whispered, wavering between amusement and
distress."I can't accept it--"

"Nonsense!"grumbled Heywood, with an angry glance."Don't spoil the
happiest evening of an old man's life.""You're right," she answered quickly; and when the plaudits ended, she
thanked the captain in a very simple, pretty speech, which made him
duck and grin,--a proud little benefactor."That ain't all," he cried gayly; then leveled a threatening finger,
like a pistol, at her neighbor."Who poked fun at me, first and last?Who always came out aboard to tell me what an old ass I was?What did I come so many hundred miles
for?To say what I always said: half-shares."The light-blue eyes, keen
with sea-cunning and the lonely sight of many far horizons, suffered an
indescribable change.There's two rich men
here to-night.It was Heywood's turn to be struck dumb."Oh, I say," he stammered at last, "it's not fair--"

"Don't spoil the happiest evening--" whispered the girl beside him.He eyed her ruefully, groaned, then springing up, went swiftly to the
head of the table and wrung the captain's brown paw, without a word
to say."Can do, can do," said Captain Kneebone, curtly."I was afraid ye might
not want to come."Then followed a whirlwind; and Teppich rose with his moustache
bristling, and the ready Nesbit jerked him down again in the opening
sentence; and everybody laughed at Heywood, who sat there so white,
with such large eyes; and the dinner going by on the wings of night, the
melancholy "boy" circled the table, all too soon, with a new silver
casket full of noble cigars from Paiacombo, Manila, and Dindigul.As the three ladies passed the foot of the table, Rudolph saw Mrs.And presently, like a prisoner going to
his judge, Chantel slipped out of the room.He was not missed; for
already the streaming candle-flames stood wreathed in blue layers, nor
was it long before the captain, mounting his chair, held a full
glass aloft."Here," he cried in triumph, "here's to every nail in the hoof--"

The glass crashed into splinters and froth.A flying stone struck the
boom of the punkah, and thumped on the table.Through the open windows,
from the road, came a wild chorus of yells, caught up and echoed by many
voices in the distance.As they slammed them home, more stones drummed on the boards and
clattered against the wall.Conches brayed somewhere, followed by an
unaccountable, sputtering fusillade as of tiny muskets, and then by a
formidable silence.While the banqueters listened in the smoky room,
there came a sullen, heavy sound, like a single stroke on a large and
very slack bass-drum."_Kau fai!_" shrilled the voices below; and then in a fainter gabble, as
though hurrying off toward the sound,--"_kau fai!_"

"The Black Dog," said Heywood, quietly.Gentlemen, we all know our
posts.Rudie, go call
Chantel.If they ask about that noise, tell
'em anything--Dragon Boat Festival beginning.Anything.--We can easily
hold this place, while the captain gets 'em out to his ship."The captain wheeled, with an injured air."Told ye, plain, I was retired.Came
the last bit in a stinking native boat, and _she's_ cleared by now.Outside, the swollen discord of shouts, thunder of gongs, and hoarse
calling of the conches came slowly nearer, extending through
the darkness.CHAPTER XVI


THE GUNWALE

Rudolph's mission began quietly, with a glimpse which he afterward
recalled as incredibly peaceful.Two of the women, at least, showed no
fear.Earle, her chin cramped on her high
bosom, while she mournfully studied his  picture-book of the
Rhine.Miss Drake, who leaned in one of the river windows, answered him,
saying rather coldly that Chantel and Mrs.Forrester had gone down to
the garden.In the court, however, he ran across Ah Pat, loitering beside a lantern.The compradore grinned, and in a tone of great unconcern called out that
the pair were not in the garden.He pointed down the
passage to the main gate, and hooked his thumb toward the right, to
indicate their course."Makee finish, makee die now," he added calmly;
"too muchee, no can."Rudolph experienced his first shock of terror, like an icy blow on the
scalp.They had gone outside before the alarm; she, Bertha, was swept
away in that tumult which came raging through the darkness.--He stood
transfixed, but only for an instant, rather by the stroke of
helplessness than by fear; and then, blindly, without plan or foresight,
darted down the covered way.The tiny flame of a pith wick, floating in
a saucer of oil, showed Heywood's gatekeeper sitting at his post, like a
gnome in the gallery of a mine.Rudolph tore away the bar, heard the
heavy gate slam shut, and found himself running down the starlit road.Not all starlight, however; a dim red glow began to flicker on the
shapes which rushed behind him in his flight.Wheeling once, he saw two
broad flames leaping high in wild and splendid rivalry,--one from
Heywood's house, one from the club.He caught also a whirling impression
of many heads and arms, far off, tiny, black, and crowded in rushing
disorder; of pale torches in the road; and of a hissing, snarling shout,
a single word, like "_Sha, sha_!"The flame at the club shot up threefold, with a crash; and a glorious
criss-cross multitude of sparks flew hissing through the treetops, like
fiery tadpoles through a net.He turned and ran on, dazzled; fell over some one who lay groaning; rose
on hands and knees, groped in the dust, and suddenly fingered thin,
rough cloth, warm and sopping.In a nausea of relief, he felt that this
was a native,--some unknown dying man, who coughed like a drunkard.Rudolph sprang up and raced again, following by habit the path which he
and she had traversed at noon.Once, with a heavy collision, he stopped
short violently in the midst of crowded men, who shouted, clung to him,
wrestling, and struck out with something sharp that ripped his tunic.He
kicked, shook them off, hammered his fists right and left, and ran free,
with a strange conviction that to-night he was invincible.Stranger
still, as the bamboo leaves now and then brushed his bare forehead, he
missed the sharp music of her cicadas.Here stood her house; she had the
briefest possible start of him, and he had run headlong the whole way;
by all the certainty of instinct, he knew that he had chosen the right
path: why, then, had he not overtaken her?If she met that band which he
had just broken through--He wavered in the darkness, and was turning
wildly to race back, when a sudden light sprang up before him in her
window.He plunged forward, in at the gate, across a plot of turf,
stumbled through the Goddess of Mercy bamboo that hedged the door, and
went falling up the dark stairs, crying aloud,--for the first time in
his life,--"Bertha!Empty rooms rang with the name, but no one answered.At last, however,
reaching the upper level, he saw by lamplight, through the open door,
two figures struggling.Just before he entered, she tore herself free
and went unsteadily across the room.Chantel, white and abject, turned
as in panic.Plainly he had not expected to see another face as white as his
own.Breathless and trembling, he spoke in a strangely little voice; but
his staring eyes lighted with a sudden and desperate resolution."Help
me with her," he begged.The woman's out of
her wits."He caught Rudolph by the arm; and standing for a moment like close
friends, the two panting rivals watched her in stupefaction.She
ransacked a great cedar chest, a table, shelves, boxes, and strewed the
contents on the floor,--silk scarfs, shining Benares brass, Chinese
silver, vivid sarongs from the Preanger regency, Kyoto cloisonne, a wild
heap of plunder from the bazaars of all the nations where Gilly's meagre
earnings had been squandered.A Cingalese box dropped and burst open,
scattering bright stones, false or precious, broadcast.She trampled
them in her blind and furious search."Come," said Chantel, and snatched at her.Every minute--"

She pushed him aside like a thing without weight or meaning, stooped
again among the gay rubbish, caught up a necklace, flung it down for
the sake of a brooch, then dropped everything and turned with blank,
dilated eyes, and the face of a child lost in a crowd."Rudolph," she whimpered, "help me.Without waiting for answer, she bent once more to sort and discard her
pitiful treasures, to pause vaguely, consider, and wring her hands.Rudolph, in his turn, caught her by the arm, but fared no better."We must humor her," whispered Chantel, and, kneeling like a peddler
among the bazaar-stuffs, spread on the floor a Java sarong, blue and
brown, painted with men and buffaloes.On this he began to heap things
pell-mell.The woman surrendered, and all at once flung her arms about Rudolph,
hiding her face, and clinging to him as if with the last of
her strength."Come, he'll bring them," she sobbed."Take me--leave
him, if he won't come--I scolded him--then the noises came, and
we ran--"

"What boat?""I have one ready and stocked," he mumbled, tugging with his teeth at
the knot in the sarong corners.We'll drop down the
river, and try it along the coast.He rose, and started for the door, slinging the bright- bundle
over his shoulder.Against the gay pattern, his
handsome pirate face shone brown and evil in the lamplight."Damn you,
I've waited long enough for your whims.The woman's arms began to drag loosely,
as if she were slipping to the floor; then suddenly, with a cry, she
turned and bolted.Run as he might, Rudolph did not overtake her till
she had caught Chantel at the gate.All three, silent, sped across
fields toward the river, through the startling shadows and dim orange
glow from distant flames.The rough ground sloped, at last, and sent them stumbling down into mud.Behind them the bank ran black and ragged against the glow; before them,
still more black, lay the river, placid, mysterious, and safe.Through
the mud they labored heavily toward a little, smoky light--a lantern
gleaming faintly on a polished gunwale, the shoulders of a man, and the
thin, slant line that was his pole.called Chantel; and the shoulders moved, the line shifted, as
the boatman answered.Chantel pitched the bundle over the lantern, and
leapt on board.Rudolph came slowly, carrying in his arms the woman,
who lay quiet and limp, clasping him in a kind of drowsy oblivion.He
felt the flutter of her lips, while she whispered in his ear strange,
breathless entreaties, a broken murmur of endearments, unheard-of, which
tempted him more than the wide, alluring darkness of the river.He lowered her slowly; and leaning against the gunwale, she still clung
to his hands.snapped their leader, from the dusk behind the
lantern.Obeying by impulse, Rudolph moved nearer the gunwale.The slippery edge,
polished by bare feet through many years, seemed the one bit of reality
in this dream, except the warmth of her hands.he asked, trying dully to rouse from a fascination."No, back to them," he answered stupidly.We can't leave--"

"You fool!"Chantel swore in one tongue, and in another cried to the
boatman--"Shove off, if they won't come!"He seized the woman roughly
and pulled her on board; but she reached out and caught Rudolph's
hand again."Come, hurry," she whispered, tugging at him.She was right, somehow; there was no power to confute her.He must come
with her, or run back, useless, into the ring of swords and flames.She
and life were in the boat; ashore, a friend cut off beyond reach, an
impossible duty, and death.His eyes, dull and fixed in the smoky
lantern-light, rested for an age on the knotted sarong.It meant
nothing; then in a flash, as though for him all light of the eyes had
concentrated in a single vision, it meant everything.The 
cloth--rudely painted in the hut of some forgotten mountaineer--held
all her treasure and her heart, the things of this world.She was beautiful--in all her fear and
disorder, still more beautiful.She went with life, departing into a
dream.This glossy gunwale, polished by bare feet, was after all the
sole reality, a shining line between life and death."Then I must die," he groaned, and wrenched his hands away from that
perilous boundary.He vaguely heard her cry out, vaguely saw Chantel rise above the lantern
and slash down at him with the lowdah's pole.The bamboo struck him,
heavy but glancing, on the head.He staggered, lost his footing, and
fell into the mud, where, as though his choice had already overtaken
him, he lay without thought or emotion, watching the dim light float off
into the darkness.From somewhere in another direction came a sharp,
continual, crackling fusillade, like the snapping of dry bamboo-joints
in a fire.The unstirring night grew heavier with the smell of burnt
gunpowder.But Rudolph, sitting in the mud, felt only that his eyes were
dry and leaden in their sockets, that there was a drumming in his ears,
and that if heat and weariness thus made an end of him, he need no
longer watch the oppressive multitude of stars, or hear the monotony of
flowing water.Without turning, he heard
a man scramble down the bank; without looking up, he felt some one pause
and stoop close.When at last, in profound apathy, he raised his eyes,
he saw against the starlight the hat, head, and shoulders of a coolie.Quite natural, he thought, that the fellow should be muttering in
German.It was only the halting, rusty fashion of the speech that
finally fretted him into listening.Rudolph dismissed him with a vague but angry motion."You cannot sit here all night," he said.Rudolph felt sharp knuckles working at his lips, and before he could
rebel, found his mouth full of sweet fiery liquid.He choked, swallowed,
and presently heard the empty bottle splash in the river.said the rescuer, and chuckled something in dispraise of
women.The rice-brandy was hot and potent; for of a sudden Rudolph found
himself afoot and awake.This man, for some strange reason, was Wutzler, a
coolie and yet a brother from the fatherland.He and his nauseous alien
brandy had restored the future.The forsaken lover was first man up the bank.he
cried, pointing to a new flare in the distance.The whole region was now
aglow like a furnace, and filled with smoke, with prolonged yells, and a
continuity of explosions that ripped the night air like tearing silk.Wutzler shuffled before him, with the trot of a
lean and exhausted laborer."I was with the men you fought, when you
ran.I followed to the house, and then here, to the river.I was glad
you did not jump on board."He glanced back, timidly, for approbation."I am a great coward, Herr Heywood told me so,--but I also stay
and help."He steered craftily among the longest and blackest shadows, now jogging
in a path, now threading the boundary of a rice-field, or waiting behind
trees; and all the time, though devious and artful as a deer-stalker,
crept toward the centre of the noise and the leaping flames.When the
quaking shadows grew thin and spare, and the lighted clearings
dangerously wide, he swerved to the right through a rolling bank of
smoke.Once Rudolph paused, with the heat of the fire on his cheeks."The nunnery is burning," he said hopelessly.His guide halted, peered shrewdly, and listened."No, they are still shooting," he answered, and limped onward, skirting
the uproar.At last, when by pale stars above the smoke and flame and sparks,
Rudolph judged that they were somewhere north of the nunnery, they came
stumbling down into a hollow encumbered with round, swollen obstacles.Like a patch of enormous melons, oil-jars lay scattered."Hide here, and wait," commanded Wutzler.And he
flitted off through the smoke.Smuggled among the oil-jars, Rudolph lay panting.Shapes of men ran
past, another empty jar rolled down beside him, and a stray bullet sang
overhead like a vibrating wire.Soon afterward, Wutzler came crawling
through the huddled pottery.The smell of rancid oil choked them, yet they could breathe without
coughing, and could rest their smarting eyes.In the midst of tumult and
combustion, the hollow lay dark as a pool.Along its rim bristled a
scrubby fringe of weeds, black against a rosy cloud.After a time, something still blacker parted the weeds.In silhouette, a
man's head, his hand grasping a staff or the muzzle of a gun, remained
there as still as though, crawling to the verge, he lay petrified in the
act of spying.CHAPTER XVII


LAMP OF HEAVEN

The white men peered from among the oil-jars, like two of the Forty
Thieves.They could detect no movement, friendly or hostile: the black
head lodged there without stirring.The watcher, whether he had seen
them or not, was in no hurry; for with chin propped among the weeds, he
held a pose at once alert and peaceful, mischievous and leisurely, as
though he were master of that hollow, and might lie all night drowsing
or waking, as the humor prompted.Wutzler pressed his face against the earth, and shivered in the stifling
heat.The uncertainty grew, with Rudolph, into an acute distress.His
legs ached and twitched, the bones of his neck were stretched as if to
break, and a corner of broken clay bored sharply between his ribs.He
felt no fear, however: only a great impatience to have the spy
begin,--rise, beckon, call to his fellows, fire his gun, hit or miss.This longing, or a flash of anger, or the rice-brandy working so nimbly
in his wits, gave him both impulse and plan."Don't move," he whispered; "wait here."And wriggling backward, inch
by inch, feet foremost among the crowded bellies of the jars, he gained
the further darkness.So far as sight would carry, the head stirred no
more than if it had been a cannon-ball planted there on the verge,
against the rosy cloud.From crawling, Rudolph rose to hands and knees,
and silently in the dust began to creep on a long circuit.Once, through
a rift in smoke, he saw a band of yellow musketeers, who crouched behind
some ragged earthwork or broken wall, loading and firing without pause
or care, chattering like outraged monkeys, and all too busy to spare a
glance behind.Their heads bobbed up and down in queer scarlet turbans
or scarfs, like the flannel nightcaps of so many diabolic invalids.Passing them unseen, he crept back toward his hollow.In spite of smoke,
he had gauged and held his circle nicely, for straight ahead lay the
man's legs.Taken thus in the rear, he still lay prone, staring down the
<DW72>, inactive; yet legs, body, and the bent arm that clutched a musket
beside him in the grass, were stiff with some curious excitement.He
seemed ready to spring up and fire.No time to lose, thought Rudolph; and rising, measured his distance with
a painful, giddy exactness.He would have counted to himself before
leaping, but his throat was too dry.He flinched a little, then shot
through the air, and landed heavily, one knee on each side, pinning the
fellow down as he grappled underneath for the throat.Almost in the same
movement he had bounded on foot again, holding both hands above his
head, as high as he could withdraw them.The body among the weeds lay
cold, revoltingly indifferent to stratagem or violence, in the same
tense attitude, which had nothing to do with life.Rudolph dropped his hands, and stood confounded by his own brutal
discourtesy.Wutzler, crawling out from the jars, scrambled joyfully
up the bank."No, no," cried Rudolph, earnestly.By the scarlet headgear, and a white symbol on the back of his jacket,
the man at their feet was one of the musketeers.He had left the
firing-line, crawled away in the dark, and found a quiet spot to die in.Wutzler doffed his coolie hat, slid out of his
jacket, tossed both down among the oil-jars, and stooping over the dead
man, began to untwist the scarlet turban.In the dim light his lean arms
and frail body, coated with black hair, gave him the look of a puny ape
robbing a sleeper.He wriggled into the dead man's jacket, wound the
blood-red cloth about his own temples, and caught up musket, ramrod,
powder-horn, and bag of bullets.--"Now I am all safe," he chuckled."Now
I can go anywhere, to-night."He shouldered arms and stood grinning as though all their troubles were
ended.We try again; come.--Not too close behind me;
and if I speak, run back."In this order they began once more to scout through the smoke.No one
met them, though distant shapes rushed athwart the gloom, yelping to
each other, and near by, legs of runners moved under a rolling cloud of
smoke as if their bodies were embedded and swept along in the
wrack:--all confused, hurried, and meaningless, like the uproar of
gongs, horns, conches, whistling bullets, crackers, and squibs that
sputtering, string upon string, flower upon rising flower of misty red
gold explosion, ripped all other noise to tatters.Where and how he followed, Rudolph never could have told; but once, as
they ran slinking through the heaviest smoke and, as it seemed, the
heart of the turmoil, he recognized the yawning rim of a clay-pit, not a
stone's throw from his own gate.It was amazing to feel that safety lay
so close; still more amazing to catch a glimpse of many coolies digging
in the pit by torchlight, peacefully, as though they had heard of no
disturbance that evening.Hardly had the picture flashed past, than he
wondered whether he had seen or imagined it, whose men they were, and
why, even at any time, they should swarm so busy, thick as ants, merely
to dig clay.He had worry enough, however, to keep in view the white cross-barred
hieroglyphic on his guide's jacket.Suddenly it vanished, and next
instant the muzzle of the gun jolted against his ribs."Run, quick," panted Wutzler, pushing him aside."To the left, into the
go-down.And with the words, he bounded
off to the right, firing his gun to confuse the chase.Rudolph obeyed, and, running at top speed, dimly understood that he had
doubled round a squad of grunting runners, whose bare feet pattered
close by him in the smoke.Before him gaped a black square, through
which he darted, to pitch head first over some fat, padded bulk.As he
rose, the rasping of rough jute against his cheek told him that he had
fallen among bales; and a familiar, musty smell, that the bales were his
own, in his own go-down, across a narrow lane from the nunnery.With
high hopes, he stumbled farther into the darkness.Once, among the
bales, he trod on a man's hand, which was silently pulled away.With no
time to think of that, he crawled and climbed over the disordered heaps,
groping toward the other door.He had nearly reached it, when torchlight
flared behind him, rushing in, and savage cries, both shrill and
guttural, rang through the stuffy warehouse.He had barely time, in the
reeling shadows, to fall on the earthen floor, and crawl under a thin
curtain of reeds to a new refuge.Into this--a cubby-hole where the compradore kept his tally-slips,
umbrella, odds and ends--the torchlight shone faintly through the reeds.Lying flat behind a roll of matting, Rudolph could see, as through the
gauze twilight of a stage scene, the tossing lights and the skipping men
who shouted back and forth, jabbing their spears or pikes down among the
bales, to probe the darkness.Before
it, in swift retreat, some one crawled past the compradore's room,
brushing the splint partition like a snake.This, as Rudolph guessed,
might be the man whose hand he had stepped on.The stitches in the curtain became beads of light.A shadowy arm heaved
up, fell with a dry, ripping sound and a vertical flash.A sword had cut
the reeds from top to bottom.Through the rent a smoking flame plunged after the sword, and after
both, a bony yellow face that gleamed with sweat.Rudolph, half wrapped
in his matting, could see the hard, glassy eyes shine cruelly in their
narrow slits; but before they lowered to meet his own, a jubilant yell
resounded in the go-down, and with a grunt, the yellow face, the
flambeau, and the sword were snatched away.He lay safe, but at the price of another man's peril.They had caught
the crawling fugitive, and now came dragging him back to the lights.Through the tattered curtain Rudolph saw him flung on the ground like an
empty sack, while his captors crowded about in a broken ring, cackling,
and prodding him with their pikes.Some jeered, some snarled, others
called him by name, with laughing epithets that rang more friendly, or
at least more jocular; but all bent toward him eagerly, and flung down
question after question, like a little band of kobolds holding an
inquisition.At some sharper cry than the rest, the fellow rose to his
knees and faced them boldly.A haggard Christian, he was being fairly
given his last chance to recant.they cried, in rage or entreaty.The kneeling captive shook his head, and made some reply, very distinct
and simple.The same sword
that had slashed the curtain now pricked his naked chest.Rudolph,
clenching his fists in a helpless longing to rush out and scatter all
these men-at-arms, had a strange sense of being transported into the
past, to watch with ghostly impotence a mediaeval tragedy.His round, honest,
oily face was anything but heroic, and wore no legendary, transfiguring
light.He seemed rather stupid than calm; yet as he mechanically wound
his queue into place once more above the shaven forehead, his fingers
moved surely and deftly.snarled the pikemen and the torch-bearers, with the
fierce gestures of men who have wasted time and patience.bawled the swordsman, beside himself.To the others, this phrase acted as a spark to powder.And several men began to rummage and overhaul the chaos of the go-down.Rudolph had given orders, that afternoon, to remove all necessary stores
to the nunnery.But from somewhere in the darkness, one rioter brought a
sack of flour, while another flung down a tin case of petroleum.The
sword had no sooner cut the sack across and punctured the tin, than a
fat villain in a loin cloth, squatting on the earthen floor, kneaded
flour and oil into a grimy batch of dough."Will you speak out and live," cried the swordsman, "or will you die?"Then, as though the option were
not in his power,--

"Die," he answered.The fat baker sprang up, and clapped on the obstinate head a shapeless
gray turban of dough.Half a dozen torches jostled for the honor of
lighting it.The Christian, crowned with sooty flames, gave a single
cry, clear above all the others.He was calling--as even Rudolph
knew--on the strange god across the sea, Saviour of the Children of the
West, not to forget his nameless and lonely servant.Rudolph groaned aloud, rose, and had parted the curtain to run out and
fall upon them all, when suddenly, close at hand and sharp in the
general din, there burst a quick volley of rifleshots.Splinters flew
from the attap walls.A torch-bearer and the man with the sword spun
half round, collided, and fell, the one across the other, like drunken
wrestlers.The survivors flung down their torches and ran, leaping and
diving over bales.On the ground, the smouldering Lamp of Heaven showed
that its wearer, rescued by a lucky bullet, lay still in a posture of
humility.Strange humility, it seemed, for one so suddenly given the
complete and profound wisdom that confirms all faith, foreign or
domestic, new or old.With a sense of all this, but no clear sense of action, Rudolph found
the side-door, opened it, closed it, and started across the lane.He
knew only that he should reach the mafoo's little gate by the pony-shed,
and step out of these dark ages into the friendly present; so that when
something from the wall blazed point-blank, and he fell flat on the
ground, he lay in utter defeat, bitterly surprised and offended.His own
friends: they might miss him once, but not twice.Instead, from the darkness above came the most welcome sound he had ever
known,--a keen, high voice, scolding.It was Heywood, somewhere on the
roof of the pony-shed.He put the question sharply, yet sounded cool and
cheerful.You waste another cartridge so, and I'll take
your gun away.Nesbit's voice clipped out some pert objection."Potted the beggar, any'ow--see for yourself--go-down's afire.""Saves us the trouble of burning it."The other voice moved away, with
a parting rebuke."No more of that, sniping and squandering.Rudolph lifted his head from the dust.answered his captain on the wall, blithely."Steady on, we'll
get you."Of all hardships, this brief delay was least bearable.Then a bight of
rope fell across Rudolph's back.He seized it, hauled taut, and planting
his feet against the wall, went up like a fish, to land gasping on a row
of sand-bags.His invisible friend clapped him on the
shoulder.Compradore has a gun for you, in the court.Report to Kneebone at the northeast corner.Danger point there:
we need a good man, so hurry.Rudolph, scrambling down from the pony-shed, ran across the compound
with his head in a whirl.Yet through all the scudding darkness and
confusion, one fact had pierced as bright as a star.On this night of
alarms, he had turned the great corner in his life.Like the pale
stranger with his crown of fire, he could finish the course.He caught his rifle from the compradore's hand, but needed no draught
from any earthly cup.Brushing through the orange trees, he made for the
northeast angle, free of all longing perplexities, purged of all vile
admiration, and fit to join his friends in clean and wholesome danger.CHAPTER XVIII


SIEGE

He never believed that they could hold the northeast corner for a
minute, so loud and unceasing was the uproar.Bullets spattered sharply
along the wall and sang overhead, mixed now and then with an
indescribable whistling and jingling.The angle was like the prow of a
ship cutting forward into a gale.Yet Rudolph climbed, rejoicing, up the
short bamboo ladder, to the platform which his coolies had built in such
haste, so long ago, that afternoon.As he stood up, in the full glow
from the burning go-down, somebody tackled him about the knees and threw
him head first on the sand-bags."How many times must I give me orders?"barked the little sea-captain."Under cover, under cover, and stay under cover, or I'll send ye below,
ye gallivanting--Oh!A
stubby finger pointed in the obscurity.and don't ye fire till
I say so!"Thus made welcome, Rudolph crawled toward a chink among the bags, ran
the muzzle of his gun into place, and lay ready for whatever might come
out of the quaking lights and darknesses beyond.Nothing came, however, except a swollen continuity of sound, a rolling
cloud of noises, thick and sullen as the smell of burnt gunpowder.It
was strange, thought Rudolph, how nothing happened from moment to
moment.No yellow bodies came charging out of the hubbub.He himself lay
there unhurt; his fellows joked, grumbled, shifted their legs on the
platform.At times the heavier, duller sound, which had been the signal
for the whole disorder,--one ponderous beat, as on a huge and very slack
bass-drum,--told that the Black Dog from Rotterdam was not far off.Yet
even then there followed no shock of round-shot battering at masonry,
but only an access of the stormy whistling and jingling."Copper cash," declared the voice of Heywood, in a lull.By the sound,
he was standing on the rungs of the ladder, with his head at the level
of the platform; also by the sound, he was enjoying himself
inordinately."What a jolly good piece of luck!Firing money at us--like you, Captain.Some unruly gang among them wouldn't wait, and forced matters.The beggars have plenty of powder, and little else.Here, in the thick of the fight, was a
light-hearted, busy commander, drawing conclusions and extracting news
from chaos."Look out for arrows," continued the speaker, as he crawled to a
loophole between Rudolph's and the captain's.Killed one convert and wounded two, there by the water gate.They can't get the elevation for you chaps here, though."And again he
added, cheerfully, "So far, at least."The little band behind the loopholes lay watching through the smoke,
listening through the noise.The Black Dog barked again, and sent a
shower of money clinking along the wall."How do you like it, Rudie?""It is terrible," answered Rudolph, honestly.Wait till their
ammunition comes; then you'll see fun."I say, Kneebone, what's your idea?Sniping all night, will it be?--or shall we get a fair chance at 'em?"The captain, a small, white, recumbent spectre, lifted his head and
appeared to sniff the smoke judicially."They get a chance at us, more like!""My opinion, the
blighters have shot and burnt themselves into a state o' mind; bloomin'
delusion o' grandeur, that's what.Wildest of 'em will rush us to-night,
once--maybe twice.We stave 'em off, say: that case, they'll settle down
to starve us, right and proper.""Wish a man
could smoke up here."Heywood laughed, and turned his head:--

"How much do you know about sieges, old chap?"Outside of school--_testudine facia,_ that sort of
thing.However," he went on cheerfully, "we shall before long"--He broke
off with a start."Gone," said Rudolph, and struggling to explain, found his late
adventure shrunk into the compass of a few words, far too small and bare
to suggest the magnitude of his decision."They went," he began, "in
a boat--"

He was saved the trouble; for suddenly Captain Kneebone cried in a voice
of keen satisfaction, "Here they come!Through a patch of firelight, down the gentle <DW72> of the field, swept
a ragged cohort of men, some bare-headed, some in their scarlet
nightcaps, as though they had escaped from bed, and all yelling.One of
the foremost, who met the captain's bullet, was carried stumbling his
own length before he sank underfoot; as the Mausers flashed from between
the sand-bags, another and another man fell to his knees or toppled
sidelong, tripping his fellows into a little knot or windrow of kicking
arms and legs; but the main wave poured on, all the faster.Among and
above them, like wreckage in that surf, tossed the shapes of
scaling-ladders and notched bamboos.Two naked men, swinging between
them a long cylinder or log, flashed through the bonfire space and on
into the dark below the wall."Look out for the pung-dong!"His friends were too busy firing into the crowded gloom below.Rudolph,
fumbling at side-bolt and pulling trigger, felt the end of a ladder bump
his forehead, saw turban and mediaeval halberd heave above him, and
without time to think of firing, dashed the muzzle of his gun at the
climber's face.The shock was solid, the halberd rang on the platform,
but the man vanished like a shade."Very neat," growled Heywood, who in the same instant, with a great
shove, managed to fling down the ladder.While he spoke, however, something hurtled over their heads and thumped
the platform.The queer log, or cylinder, lay there with a red coal
sputtering at one end, a burning fuse.Heywood snatched at it and
missed.Some one else caught up the long bulk, and springing to his
feet, swung it aloft.Firelight showed the bristling moustache of
Kempner, his long, thin arms poising a great bamboo case bound with
rings of leather or metal.He threw it out with his utmost force,
staggered as though to follow it; then, leaping back, straightened his
tall body with a jerk, flung out one arm in a gesture of surprise, no
sooner rigid than drooping; and even while he seemed inflated for
another of his speeches, turned half-round and dove into the garden and
the night.By the ending of it, he had redeemed a somewhat rancid life.Before, the angle was alive with swarming heads.As he fell, it was
empty, and the assault finished; for below, the bamboo tube burst with a
sound that shook the wall; liquid flame, the Greek fire of stink-pot
chemicals, squirted in jets that revealed a crowd torn asunder, saffron
faces contorted in shouting, and men who leapt away with clothes afire
and powder-horns bursting at their sides.Dim figures scampered off, up
the rising ground."That's over," panted Heywood."Thundering good lesson,--Here, count
noses.Sturgeon, Teppich, Padre, Captain?but
look sharp, while I go inspect.""Come down,
won't you, and help me with--you know."At the foot of the ladder, they met a man in white, with a white face in
what might be the dawn, or the pallor of the late-risen moon.He hailed them in a dry voice, and cleared his throat,
"Where is she?It was here, accordingly, while Heywood stooped over a tumbled object on
the ground, that Rudolph told her husband what Bertha Forrester had
chosen.The words came harder than before, but at last he got rid of
them.It was like telling the news of
an absent ghost to another present."This town was never a place," said Gilly, with all his former
steadiness,--"never a place to bring a woman.All three men listened to the conflict of gongs and crackers, and to the
shouting, now muffled and distant behind the knoll.All three, as it
seemed to Rudolph, had consented to ignore something vile."That's all I wanted to know," said the older man, slowly."I must get
back to my post.You didn't say, but--She made no attempt to come here?For some time again they stood as though listening, till Heywood
spoke:--

"Holding your own, are you, by the water gate?""Oh, yes," replied Forrester, rousing slightly.Heywood skipped up the ladder, to return with a rifle."And this belt--Kempner's.Poor chap, he'll never ask you to return
them.--Anything else?""No," answered Gilly, taking the dead man's weapon, and moving off into
the darkness."Except if we come to a pinch,
and need a man for some tight place, then give me first chance.I could do better, now, than--than you younger men.Oh, and Hackh;
your efforts to-night--Well, few men would have dared, and I feel
immensely grateful."He disappeared among the orange trees, leaving Rudolph to think about
such gratitude."Now, then," called Heywood, and stooped to the white bundle at their
feet.Trust old Gilly to take it
like a man.And between them the two friends carried to the nunnery a tiresome
theorist, who had acted once, and now, himself tired and limp, would
offend no more by speaking.When the dawn filled the compound with a deep blue twilight, and this in
turn grew pale, the night-long menace of noise gradually faded also,
like an orgy of evil spirits dispersing before cockcrow.To ears long
deafened, the wide stillness had the effect of another sound, never
heard before.Even when disturbed by the flutter of birds darting from
top to dense green top of the orange trees, the air seemed hushed by
some unholy constraint.Through the cool morning vapors, hot smoke from
smouldering wreckage mounted thin and straight, toward where the pale
disk of the moon dissolved in light.The convex field stood bare, except
for a few overthrown scarecrows in naked yellow or dusty blue, and for a
jagged strip of earthwork torn from the crest, over which the Black Dog
thrust his round muzzle.In a truce of empty silence, the defenders
slept by turns among the sand-bags.The day came, and dragged by without incident.The sun blazed in the
compound, swinging overhead, and slanting down through the afternoon.At
the water gate, Rudolph, Heywood, and the padre, with a few forlorn
Christians,--driven in like sheep, at the last moment,--were building
a rough screen against the arrows that had flown in darkness, and that
now lay scattered along the path.One of these a workman suddenly caught
at, and with a grunt, held up before the padre.About the shaft, wound tightly with silk thread, ran
a thin roll of Chinese paper.Earle nodded, took the arrow, and slitting with a pocket-knife,
freed and flattened out a painted scroll of complex characters.His keen
old eyes ran down the columns.His face, always cloudy now, grew darker
with perplexity.He sat
down on a pile of sacks, and spread the paper on his knee."But the
characters are so elaborate--I can't make head or tail."He beckoned Heywood, and together they scowled at the intricate and
meaningless symbols."No, see here--lower left hand."The last stroke of the brush, down in the corner, formed a loose "O.For all that, the painted lines remained a stubborn puzzle.The padre pulled out a cigar, and smoking
at top speed, spaced off each character with his thumb."They are all
alike, and yet"--He clutched his white hair with big knuckles, and
tugged; replaced his mushroom helmet; held the paper at a new focus.he said doubtfully; and at last, "Yes."For some time he read to
himself, nodding."Take only the left half of that word, and what have you?""Take," the padre ordered, "this one; left half?""The right half--might be
'rice-scoop,' But that's nonsense."Subtract this twisted character 'Lightning' from each, and we've made
the crooked straight.Here's the
sense of his message, I take it."And he read off, slowly:--

"A Hakka boat on opposite shore; a green flag and a rice-scoop hoisted
at her mast; light a fire on the water-gate steps, and she will come
quickly, day or night.--O.W.""That won't help," he said curtly.With the aid of a convert, he unbarred the ponderous gate, and ventured
out on the highest slab of the landing-steps.Across the river, to be
sure, there lay--between a local junk and a stray _papico_ from the
north--the high-nosed Hakka boat, her deck roofed with tawny
basket-work, and at her masthead a wooden rice-measure dangling below a
green rag.Aft, by the great steering-paddle, perched a man, motionless,
yet seeming to watch.Heywood turned, however, and pointed downstream to
where, at the bend of the river, a little spit of mud ran out from the
marsh.On the spit, from among tussocks, a man in a round hat sprang up
like a thin black toadstool.He waved an arm, and gave a shrill cry,
summoning help from further inland.Other hats presently came bobbing
toward him, low down among the marsh.Puffs of white spurted out from
the mud.And as Heywood dodged back through the gate, and Nesbit's rifle
answered from his little fort on the pony-shed, the distant crack of the
muskets joined with a spattering of ooze and a chipping of stone on the
river-stairs."Covered, you see," said Heywood, replacing the bar."Last resort,
perhaps, that way.Still, we may as well keep a bundle of firewood
ready here."The shots from the marsh, though trivial and scattering, were like a
signal; for all about the nunnery, from a ring of hiding-places, the
noise of last night broke out afresh.The sun lowered through a brown,
burnt haze, the night sped up from the ocean, covering the sky with
sudden darkness, in which stars appeared, many and cool, above the
torrid earth and the insensate turmoil.So, without change but from
pause to outbreak, outbreak to pause, nights and days went by in
the siege.One morning, indeed, the fragments of another blunt
arrow came to light, broken underfoot and trampled into the dust.The
paper scroll, in tatters, held only a few marks legible through dirt and
heel-prints: "Listen--work fast--many bags--watch closely."And still
nothing happened to explain the warning.That night Heywood even made a sortie, and stealing from the main gate
with four coolies, removed to the river certain relics that lay close
under the wall, and would soon become intolerable.He had returned
safely, with an ancient musket, a bag of bullets, a petroleum squirt,
and a small bundle of pole-axes, and was making his tour of the
defenses, when he stumbled over Rudolph, who knelt on the ground under
what in old days had been the chapel, and near what now was
Kempner's grave.He was not kneeling in devotion, for he took Heywood by the arm, and
made him stoop."I was coming," he said, "to find you.The first night, I saw coolies
working in the clay-pit."They're keeping such a racket outside," he muttered; and then, half to
himself: "It certainly is.Rudie, it's--it's as if poor Kempner
were--waking up."The two friends sat up, and eyed each other in the starlight.CHAPTER XIX


BROTHER MOLES

This new danger, working below in the solid earth, had thrown Rudolph
into a state of sullen resignation.What was the use now, he thought
indignantly, of all their watching and fighting?The ground, at any
moment, might heave, break, and spring up underfoot.He waited for his
friend to speak out, and put the same thought roundly into words.Instead, to his surprise, he heard something quite contrary."Now we know what
the beasts have up their sleeve.He sat thinking, a white figure in the starlight, cross-legged like a
Buddha."That's why they've all been lying doggo," he continued."And then their
bad marksmanship, with all this sniping--they don't care, you see,
whether they pot us or not.They'd rather make one clean sweep, and
'blow us at the moon.'Cheer up, Rudie: so long as they're digging,
they're not blowing.While he spoke, the din outside the walls wavered and sank, at last
giving place to a shrill, tiny interlude of insect voices.In this
diluted silence came now and then a tinkle of glass from the dark
hospital room where Miss Drake was groping among her vials."If it weren't for that," he said quietly, "I shouldn't much care.Except for the women, this would really be great larks."Then, as a
shadow flitted past the orange grove, he roused himself to hail: "Ah
Pat!Go catchee four piecee coolie-man!"The shadow passed, and after a time returned with four other
shadows.They stood waiting, till Heywood raised his head from the dust."Those noises have stopped, down there," he said to Rudolph; and rising,
gave his orders briefly.The coolies were to dig, strike into the
sappers' tunnel, and report at once: "Chop-chop.--Meantime, Rudie, let's
take a holiday.A solitary candle burned in the far corner of the inclosure, and cast
faint streamers of reflection along the wet flags, which, sluiced with
water from the well, exhaled a slight but grateful coolness.Heywood
stooped above the quivering flame, lighted a cigar, and sinking loosely
into a chair, blew the smoke upward in slow content."Nothing to do, nothing to fret about, till the
compradore reports.For a long time, lying side by side, they might have been asleep.Through the dim light on the white walls dipped and swerved the drunken
shadow of a bat, who now whirled as a flake of blackness across the
stars, now swooped and set the humbler flame reeling.The flutter of his
leathern wings, and the plash of water in the dark, where a coolie still
drenched the flags, marked the sleepy, soothing measures in a nocturne,
broken at strangely regular intervals by a shot, and the crack of a
bullet somewhere above in the deserted chambers."Queer," mused Heywood, drowsily studying his watch."The beggar puts
one shot every five minutes through the same window.--I wonder what he's
thinking about?Lying out there, firing at the Red-Bristled Ghosts.Wonder what they're all"--He put back his cigar, mumbling."Handful of
poor blackguards, all upset in their minds, and sweating round.And all
the rest tranquil as ever, eh?--the whole country jogging on the same
old way, or asleep and dreaming dreams, perhaps, same kind of dreams
they had in Marco Polo's day."The end of his cigar burned red again; and again, except for that, he
might have been asleep.Rudolph made no answer, but lay thinking.This
brief moment of rest in the cool, dim courtyard--merely to lie there
and wait--seemed precious above all other gain or knowledge.Some quiet
influence, a subtle and profound conviction, slowly was at work in him.It was patience, wonder, steady confidence,--all three, and more.He had
felt it but this once, obscurely; might die without knowing it in
clearer fashion; and yet could never lose it, or forget, or come to any
later harm.With it the stars, above the dim vagaries of the bat, were
brightly interwoven.For the present he had only to lie ready, and wait,
a single comrade in a happy army.Through a dark little door came Miss Drake, all in white, and moving
quietly, like a symbolic figure of evening, or the genius of the place.Her hair shone duskily as she bent beside the candle, and with steady
fingers tilted a vial, from which amber drops fell slowly into a glass.With dark eyes watching closely, she had the air of a young, beneficent
Medea, intent on some white magic."Aren't you coming," called Heywood, "to sit with us awhile?""Can't, thanks," she replied, without looking up.She moved away, carrying her medicines, but paused in the door, smiled
back at him as from a crypt, and said:--

"Have _you_ been hurt?""I've no time," she laughed, "for lazy able-bodied persons."And she was
gone in the darkness, to sit by her wounded men.With her went the interval of peace; for past the well-curb came another
figure, scuffing slowly toward the light.The compradore, his robes lost
in their background, appeared as an oily face and a hand beckoning with
downward sweep.The two friends rose, and followed him down the
courtyard.In passing out, they discovered the padre's wife lying
exhausted in a low chair, of which she filled half the length and all
the width.Heywood paused beside her with some friendly question, to
which Rudolph caught the answer.Her voice sounded fretful, her fan stirred weakly.I feel quite ready to suffer for the faith."Earle," said the young man, gently, "there ought to be no
need.Under the orange trees, he laid an unsteady hand on Rudolph's arm, and
halting, shook with quiet merriment.Loose earth underfoot warned them not to stumble over the new-raised
mound beside the pit, which yawned slightly blacker than the night.Kempner's grave had not been quieter.The compradore stood whispering:
they had found the tunnel empty, because, he thought, the sappers were
gone out to eat their chow."We'll see, anyway," said Heywood, stripping off his coat.He climbed
over the mound, grasped the edges, and promptly disappeared.In the long
moment which followed, the earth might have closed on him.Once, as
Rudolph bent listening over the shaft, there seemed to come a faint
momentary gleam; but no sound, and no further sign, until the head and
shoulders burrowed up again."Big enough hole down there," he reported, swinging clear, and sitting
with his feet in the shaft.Three sacks of powder stowed
already, so we're none too soon.--One sack was leaky.I struck a match,
and nearly blew myself to Casabianca.""It
gives us a plan, though.Rudie: are you game for something rather
foolhardy?Be frank, now; for if you wouldn't really enjoy it, I'll give
old Gilly Forrester his chance."said Rudolph, stung as by some perfidy.This is all ours, this part, so!"Give me half a
moment start, so that you won't jump on my head."And he went wriggling
down into the pit.An unwholesome smell of wet earth, a damp, subterranean coolness,
enveloped Rudolph as he slid down a flue of greasy clay, and stooping,
crawled into the horizontal bore of the tunnel.Large enough, perhaps,
for two or three men to pass on all fours, it ran level, roughly cut,
through earth wet with seepage from the river, but packed into a smooth
floor by many hands and bare knees.In
the small chamber of the mine, choked with the smell of stale betel, he
bumped Heywood's elbow."Some Fragrant Ones have been working here, I should say."The speaker
patted the ground with quick palms, groping.This explains old Wutz, and his broken arrow.I say, Rudie, feel
about.I saw a coil of fuse lying somewhere.--At least, I thought it
was."How's the old forearm I gave you?Equal to hauling a
sack out?Sweeping his hand in the darkness, he captured Rudolph's, and guided it
to where a powder-bag lay."Now, then, carry on," he commanded; and crawling into the tunnel,
flung back fragments of explanation as he tugged at his own load."Carry
these out--far as we dare--touch 'em off, you see, and block the
passage.We can use this hole afterward,
for listening in, if they try--"

He cut the sentence short.Their tunnel had begun to <DW72> gently
downward, with niches gouged here and there for the passing of
burden-bearers.Rudolph, toiling after, suddenly found his head
entangled between his leader's boots.An odd little squeak of
surprise followed, a strange gurgling, and a succession of rapid shocks,
as though some one were pummeling the earthen walls."Got the beggar," panted Heywood.Roll clear, Rudie,
and let us pass.Collar his legs, if you can, and shove."Squeezing past Rudolph in his niche, there struggled a convulsive bulk,
like some monstrous worm, too large for the bore, yet writhing.Bare
feet kicked him in violent rebellion, and a muscular knee jarred
squarely under his chin.He caught a pair of naked legs, and hugged
them dearly."Not too hard," called Heywood, with a breathless laugh."Poor
devil--must think he ran foul of a genie."Indeed, their prisoner had already given up the conflict, and lay under
them with limbs dissolved and quaking."Pass him along," chuckled his captor.Prodded into action, the man stirred limply, and crawled past them
toward the mine, while Heywood, at his heels, growled orders in the
vernacular with a voice of dismal ferocity.In this order they gained
the shaft, and wriggled up like ferrets into the night air.Rudolph,
standing as in a well, heard a volley of questions and a few timid
answers, before the returning legs of his comrade warned him to dodge
back into the tunnel.Again the two men crept forward on their expedition; and this time the
leader talked without lowering his voice."That chap," he declared, "was fairly chattering with fright.Coolie, it
seems, who came back to find his betel-box.The rest are all outside
eating their rice.They stumbled on their powder-sacks, caught hold, and dragged them, at
first easily down the incline, then over a short level, then arduously
up a rising grade, till the work grew heavy and hot, and breath came
hard in the stifled burrow."Far enough," said Heywood, puffing.Rudolph, however, was not only drenched with sweat, but fired by a new
spirit, a spirit of daring.He would try, down here in the bowels of the
earth, to emulate his friend."But let us reconnoitre," he objected."It will bring us to the clay-pit
where I saw them digging.Let us go out to the end, and look."By his tone, he was proud of the amendment.I say, I didn't really--I didn't _want_ poor old
Gilly down here, you know."They crawled on, with more speed but no less caution, up the strait
little gallery, which now rose between smooth, soft walls of clay.Suddenly, as the incline once more became a level, they saw a glimmering
square of dusky red, like the fluttering of a weak flame through scarlet
cloth.This, while they shuffled toward it, grew higher and broader,
until they lay prone in the very door of the hill,--a large, square-cut
portal, deeply overhung by the edge of the clay-pit, and flanked with
what seemed a bulkhead of sand-bags piled in orderly tiers.Between
shadowy mounds of loose earth flickered the light of a fire, small and
distant, round which wavered the inky silhouettes of men, and beyond
which dimly shone a yellow face or two, a yellow fist clutched full of
boiled rice like a snowball.Beyond these, in turn, gleamed other little
fires, where other coolies were squatting at their supper.Heywood's voice trembled with joyful excitement."Look,
these bags; not sand-bags at all!Wait a bit--oh, by Jove, wait a bit!"He scurried back into the hill like a great rat, returned as quickly and
swiftly, and with eager hands began to uncoil something on the clay
threshold."Do you know enough to time a fuse?""Neither do I.
Powder's bad, anyhow.Here, quick, lend me a
knife."He slashed open one of the lower sacks in the bulkhead by the
door, stuffed in some kind of twisted cord, and, edging away, sat for an
instant with his knife-blade gleaming in the ruddy twilight."How long,
Rudie, how long?""Too long, or too short, spoils
everything."Now lie across," he ordered, "and shield the tandstickor."With a
sudden fuff, the match blazed up to show his gray eyes bright and
dancing, his face glossy with sweat; below, on the golden clay, the
twisted, lumpy tail of the fuse, like the end of a dusty vine.Darkness
followed, quick and blinding.A rosy, fitful coal sputtered, darting out
short capillary lines and needles of fire.If it blows up, and caves the earth on
us--" Heywood ran on hands and knees, as if that were his natural way of
going.Rudolph scrambled after, now urged by an ecstasy of apprehension,
now clogged as by the weight of all the hill above them.If it should
fall now, he thought, or now; and thus measuring as he crawled, found
the tunnel endless.When at last, however, they gained the bottom of the shaft, and were
hoisted out among their coolies on the shelving mound, the evening
stillness lay above and about them, undisturbed.The fuse could never
have lasted all these minutes."Gone out," said Heywood, gloomily.He climbed the bamboo scaffold, and stood looking over the wall.Rudolph
perched beside him,--by the same anxious, futile instinct of curiosity,
for they could see nothing but the night and the burning stars.Underground again, Rudie, and try our first plan.""The Sword-Pen looks to set off his mine
to-morrow morning."He clutched the wall in time to save himself, as the bamboo frame leapt
underfoot.Outside, the crest of the <DW72> ran black against a single
burst of flame.The detonation came like the blow of a mallet on
the ribs.Heywood jumped to the ground, and in a
pelting shower of clods, exulted:--


"He looked again, and saw it was
The middle of next week!"He ran off, laughing, in the wide hush of astonishment.CHAPTER XX


THE HAKKA BOAT

"Pretty fair," Captain Kneebone said.This grudging praise--in which, moreover, Heywood tamely acquiesced--was
his only comment.On Rudolph it had singular effects: at first filling
him with resentment, and almost making him suspect the little captain of
jealousy; then amusing him, as chance words of no weight; but in the
unreal days that followed, recurring to convince him with all the force
of prompt and subtle fore-knowledge.It helped him to learn the cold,
salutary lesson, that one exploit does not make a victory.The springing of their countermine, he found, was no deliverance.It had
two plain results, and no more: the crest of the high field, without,
had changed its contour next morning as though a monster had bitten it;
and when the day had burnt itself out in sullen darkness, there burst on
all sides an attack of prolonged and furious exasperation.The fusillade
now came not only from the landward sides, but from a long flotilla of
boats in the river; and although these vanished at dawn, the fire never
slackened, either from above the field, or from a distant wall, newly
spotted with loopholes, beyond the ashes of the go-down.On the night
following, the boats crept closer, and suddenly both gates resounded
with the blows of battering-rams.By daylight, the nunnery walls were pitted as with small-pox; yet
the little company remained untouched, except for Teppich, whose shaven
head was trimmed still closer and redder by a bullet, and for Gilbert
Forrester, who showed--with the grave smile of a man when fates are
playful--two shots through his loose jacket.He was the only man to smile; for the others, parched by days and
sweltered by nights of battle, questioned each other with hollow eyes
and sleepy voices.One at a time, in patches of hot shade, they lay
tumbled for a moment of oblivion, their backs studded thickly with
obstinate flies like the driven heads of nails.As thickly, in the dust,
empty Mauser cartridges lay glistening."And I bought food," mourned the captain, chafing the untidy stubble on
his cheeks, and staring gloomily down at the worthless brass."I bought
chow, when all Saigong was full o' cartridges!"The sight of the spent ammunition at their feet gave them more trouble
than the swarming flies, or the heat, or the noises tearing and
splitting the heat.Even Heywood went about with a hang-dog air,
speaking few words, and those more and more surly.Once he laughed, when
at broad noonday a line of queer heads popped up from the earthwork on
the knoll, and stuck there, tilted at odd angles, as though peering
quizzically.Both his laugh, however, and his one stare of scrutiny were
filled with a savage contempt,--contempt not only for the stratagem, but
for himself, the situation, all things."Dummies--lay figures, to draw our fire.he added, wearily "we couldn't waste a shot at 'em now even if they
were real."They knew, without being told,
that they should fire no more until at close quarters in some
final rush."Only a few more rounds apiece," he continued."Our friends outside must
have run nearly as short, according to the coolie we took prisoner in
the tunnel.But they'll get more supplies, he says, in a day or two.What's worse, his Generalissimo Fang expects big reinforcement, any day,
from up country."Perhaps he's lying," said Captain Kneebone, drowsily."Wish he were," snapped Heywood."That case," grumbled the captain, "we'd better signal your Hakka boat,
and clear out."Again their hollow eyes questioned each other in discouragement.It was
plain that he had spoken their general thought; but they were all too
hot and sleepy to debate even a point of safety.Thus, in stupor or
doubt, they watched another afternoon burn low by invisible degrees,
like a great fire dying.Another breathless evening settled over all--at
first with a dusty, copper light, widespread, as though sky and land
were seen through smoked glass; another dusk, of deep, sad blue; and
when this had given place to night, another mysterious lull.Midnight drew on, and no further change had come.Prowlers, made bold by
the long silence in the nunnery, came and went under the very walls of
the compound.In the court, beside a candle, Ah Pat the compradore sat
with a bundle of halberds and a whetstone, sharpening edge after edge,
placidly, against the time when there should be no more cartridges.Heywood and Rudolph stood near the water gate, and argued with Gilbert
Forrester, who would not quit his post for either of them."But I'm not sleepy," he repeated, with perverse, irritating serenity.And that river full of their boats?--Go away."While they reasoned and wrangled, something scraped the edge of the
wall.They could barely detect a small, stealthy movement above them, as
if a man, climbing, had lifted his head over the top.Suddenly, beside
it, flared a surprising torch, rags burning greasily at the end of a
long bamboo.The smoky, dripping flame showed no man there, but only
another long bamboo, impaling what might be another ball of rags.The
two poles swayed, inclined toward each other; for one incredible instant
the ball, beside its glowing fellow, shone pale and took on human
features.Black shadows filled the eye-sockets, and gave to the face an
uncertain, cavernous look, as though it saw and pondered.How long the apparition stayed, the three men could not tell; for even
after it vanished, and the torch fell hissing in the river, they stood
below the wall, dumb and sick, knowing only that they had seen the head
of Wutzler.Heywood was the first to make a sound--a broken, hypnotic sound, without
emphasis or inflection, as though his lips were frozen, or the words
torn from him by ventriloquy."We must get the women--out of here."Afterward, when he was no longer with them, his two friends recalled
that he never spoke again that night, but came and went in a kind of
silent rage, ordering coolies by dumb-show, and carrying armful after
armful of supplies to the water gate.The word passed, or a listless, tacit understanding, that every one must
hold himself ready to go aboard so soon after daylight as the hostile
boats should leave the river."If," said Gilly to Rudolph, while they
stood thinking under the stars, "if his boat is still there, now that
he--after what we saw."At dawn they could see the ragged flotilla of sampans stealing up-river
on the early flood; but of the masts that huddled in vapors by the
farther bank, they had no certainty until sunrise, when the green rag
and the rice-measure appeared still dangling above the Hakka boat.Even then it was not certain--as Captain Kneebone sourly pointed
out--that her sailors would keep their agreement.And when he had piled,
on the river-steps, the dry wood for their signal fire, a new difficulty
rose.One of the wounded converts was up, and hobbling with a stick; but
the other would never be ferried down any stream known to man.He lay
dying, and the padre could not leave him.All the others waited, ready and anxious; but no one grumbled because
death, never punctual, now kept them waiting.The flutter of birds,
among the orange trees, gradually ceased; the sun came slanting over
the eastern wall; the gray floor of the compound turned white and
blurred through the dancing heat.A torrid westerly breeze came
fitfully, rose, died away, rose again, and made Captain Kneebone curse."Next we'll lose the ebb, too, be
'anged."Noon passed, and mid-afternoon, before the padre came out from the
courtyard, covering his white head with his ungainly helmet."We may go now," he said gravely, "in a few minutes."No more were needed, for the loose clods in the old shaft of their
counter-mine were quickly handled, and the necessary words soon uttered.Captain Kneebone had slipped out through the water gate, beforehand, and
lighted the fire on the steps.But not one of the burial party turned
his head, to watch the success or failure of their signal, so long as
the padre's resonant bass continued.When it ceased, however, they returned quickly through the little grove.The captain opened the great gate, and looked out eagerly, craning to
see through the smoke that poured into his face.The Hakka boat had, indeed, vanished from her moorings.On the bronze
current, nothing moved but three fishing-boats drifting down, with the
smoke, toward the marsh and the bend of the river, and a small junk that
toiled up against wind and tide, a cluster of naked sailors tugging and
shoving at her heavy sweep, which chafed its rigging of dry rope, and
gave out a high, complaining note like the cry of a sea-gull."She's gone," repeated Captain Kneebone.But the compradore, dragging his bundle of sharp halberds, poked an
inquisitive head out past the captain's, and peered on all sides through
the smoke, with comical thoroughness.He dodged back, grinning and
ducking amiably."Moh bettah look-see," he chuckled; "dat coolie come-back, he too muchee
waitee, b'long one piecee foolo-man."Whoever handled the Hakka boat was no fool, but by working
upstream on the opposite shore, crossing above, and dropping down with
the ebb, had craftily brought her along the shallow, so close beneath
the river-wall, that not till now did even the little captain spy her.The high prow, the mast, now bare, and her round midships roof, bright
golden-thatched with leaves of the edible bamboo, came moving quiet as
some enchanted boat in a calm.The fugitives by the gate still thought
themselves abandoned, when her beak, six feet in air, stole past them,
and her lean boatmen, prodding the river-bed with their poles, stopped
her as easily as a gondola.The yellow steersman grinned, straining at
the pivot of his gigantic paddle."Remember _you_ in my will, too!"And the grinning lowdah nodded, as though he understood.They had now only to pitch their supplies through the smoke, down on the
loose boards of her deck.Then--Rudolph and the captain kicking the
bonfire off the stairs--the whole company hurried down and safely over
her gunwale: first the two women, then the few huddling converts, the
white men next, the compradore still hugging his pole-axes, and last of
all, Heywood, still in strange apathy, with haggard face and downcast
eyes.He stumbled aboard as though drunk, his rifle askew under one arm,
and in the crook of the other, Flounce, the fox-terrier, dangling,
nervous and wide awake.He looked to neither right nor left, met nobody's eye.The rest of the
company crowded into the house amidships, and flung themselves down
wearily in the grateful dusk, where vivid paintings and mysteries of
rude carving writhed on the fir bulkheads.But Heywood, with his dog and
the captain and Rudolph, sat in the hot sun, staring down at the
ramshackle deck, through the gaps in which rose all the stinks of the
sweating hold.The boatmen climbed the high slant of the bow, planted their stout
bamboos against their shoulders, and came slowly down, head first, like
straining acrobats.As slowly, the boat began to glide past the stairs.Thus far, though the fire lay scattered in the mud, the smoke drifted
still before them and obscured their silent, headlong transaction.Now,
thinning as they dropped below the corner of the wall, it left them
naked to their enemies on the knoll.At the same instant, from the marsh
ahead, the sentinel in the round hat sprang up again, like an
instantaneous mushroom.He shouted, and waved to his fellows inland.They had no time, however, to leave the high ground; for the whole
chance of the adventure took a sudden and amazing turn.Heywood sprang out of his stupor, and stood pointing.The face of his friend, by torchlight above the
wall, had struck him dumb.Now that he spoke, his companions saw,
exposed in the field to the view of the nunnery, a white body lying on a
framework as on a bier.Near the foot stood a rough sort of windlass.Above, on the crest of the field, where a band of men had begun to
scramble at the sentinel's halloo, there sat on a white pony the
bright-robed figure of the tall fanatic, Fang the Sword-Pen.Heywood's hands opened and shut rapidly, like things out of
control."Oh, Wutz, how did they--Saint Somebody--the martyrdom--
Poussin's picture in the Vatican.--I can't stand this, you chaps!"He snatched blindly at his gun, caught instead one of the compradore's
halberds, and without pause or warning, jumped out into the shallow
water.He ran splashing toward the bank, turned, and seemed to waver,
staring with wild eyes at the strange Tudor weapon in his hand.Then
shaking it savagely,--

"This will do!"He wheeled again, staggered to his feet on dry ground, and ran swiftly
along the eastern wall, up the rising field, straight toward his mark.Of the men on the knoll, a few fired and missed, the others, neutrals to
their will, stood fixed in wonder.Four or five, as the runner neared,
sprang out to intercept, but flew apart like ninepins.The watchers in
the boat saw the halberd flash high in the late afternoon sun, the
frightened pony swerve, and his rider go down with the one sweep of that
Homeric blow.The last they saw of Heywood, he went leaping from sight over the
crest, that swarmed with figures racing and stumbling after.The unheeded sentinel in the marsh fled, losing his great hat, as the
boat drifted round the point into midstream.CHAPTER XXI


THE DRAGON'S SHADOW

The lowdah would have set his dirty sails without delay, for the fair
wind was already drooping; but at the first motion he found himself
deposed, and a usurper in command, at the big steering-paddle.Captain
Kneebone, his cheeks white and suddenly old beneath the untidy stubble
of his beard, had taken charge.In momentary danger of being cut off
downstream, or overtaken from above, he kept the boat waiting along the
oozy shore.Puckering his eyes, he watched now the land, and now the
river, silent, furtive, and keenly perplexed, his head on a swivel, as
though he steered by some nightmare chart, or expected some instant and
transforming sight.Not until the sun touched the western hills, and long shadows from the
bank stole out and turned the stream from bright copper to vague
iron-gray, did he give over his watch.He left the tiller, with a
hopeless fling of the arm."Do as ye please," he growled, and cast himself down on deck by the
thatched house."Go on.--I'll never see _him_ again.--The heat, and
all--By the head, he was--Go on.He sat looking straight before him, with dull eyes that never moved;
nor did he stir at the dry rustle and scrape of the matting sail, slowly
hoisted above him.The quaggy banks, now darkening, slid more rapidly
astern; while the steersman and his mates in the high bow invoked the
wind with alternate chant, plaintive, mysterious, and half musical:--


"Ay-ly-chy-ly
Ah-ha-aah!"To the listeners, huddled in silence, the familiar cry became a long,
monotonous accompaniment to sad thoughts.Through the rhythm, presently,
broke a sound of small-arms,--a few shots, quick but softened by
distance, from far inland.The captain stirred, listened, dropped his head, and sat like stone.To
Rudolph, near him, the brief disturbance called up another evening--his
first on this same river, when from the grassy brink, above, he had
first heard of his friend.Now, at the same place, and by the same
light, they had heard the last.It was intolerable: he turned his back
on the captain.Inside, in the gloom of the painted cabin, the padre's
wife began suddenly to cry.After a time, the deep voice of her husband,
speaking very low, and to her alone, became dimly audible:--

"'All this is come upon us; yet have we not--Our heart is not turned
back, neither have our steps declined--Though thou hast sore broken us
in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.'"The little captain groaned, and rolled aside from the doorway."All very fine," he muttered, his head wrapped in his arms."But that's
no good to me.Whether she heard him, or by chance, Miss Drake came quietly from
within, and found a place between him and the gunwale.He did not rouse;
she neither glanced nor spoke, but leaned against the ribs of
smooth-worn fir, as though calmly waiting.When at last he looked up, to see her face and posture, he gave an angry
start."And I thought," he blurted, "be 'anged if sometimes I didn't think you
liked him!"Her dark eyes met the captain's with a great and steadfast clearness."No," she whispered; "it was more than that."The captain sat bolt upright, but no longer in condemnation.For a long
time he watched her, marveling; and when finally he spoke, his sharp,
domineering voice was lowered, almost gentle.I never
meant--Don't ye mind a rough old beggar, that don't know that hasn't one
thing more between him and the grave.And that,
now--I wish't was at the bottom o' this bloomin' river!"They said no more, but rested side by side, like old friends joined
closer by new grief.Flounce, the terrier, snuffing disconsolately about
the deck, and scratching the boards in her zeal to explore the shallow
hold, at last grew weary, and came to snuggle down between the two
silent companions.Not till then did the girl turn aside her face, as
though studying the shore, which now melted in a soft, half-liquid band
as black as coal-tar, above the luminous indigo of the river.Suddenly Rudolph got upon his feet, and craning outboard from gunwale
and thatched eaves, looked steadily forward into the dusk.A chatter of
angry voices came stealing up, in the pauses of the wind.He watched and
listened, then quickly drew in his head.Two or three of the voices hailed together, raucously.The steersman,
leaning on the loom of his paddle, made neither stir nor answer.They
hailed again, this time close aboard, and as it seemed, in rage.Glancing contemptuously to starboard, the lowdah made some negligent
reply, about a cargo of human hair.His indifference appeared so real,
that for a moment Rudolph suspected him: perhaps he had been bought
over, and this meeting arranged.The
voices began to drop astern, and to come in louder confusion with
the breeze.But at this point Flounce, the terrier, spoiled all by whipping up
beside the lowdah, and furiously barking.Hers was no pariah's yelp: she
barked with spirit, in the King's English.For answer, there came a shout, a sharp report, and a bullet that ripped
through the matting sail.The steersman ducked, but clung bravely to his
paddle.Men tumbled out from the cabin, rifles in hand, to join Rudolph
and the captain.Astern, dangerously near, they saw the hostile craft, small, but listed
heavily with crowding ruffians, packed so close that their great wicker
hats hung along the gunwale to save room, and shone dim in the obscurity
like golden shields of vikings.A squat, burly fellow, shouting, jammed
the yulow hard to bring her about."Save your fire," called Captain Kneebone.As he spoke, however, an active form bounced up beside the squat man at
the sweep,--a plump, muscular little barefoot woman in blue.She tore
the fellow's hands away, and took command, keeping the boat's nose
pointed up-river, and squalling ferocious orders to all on board.This small, nimble, capable creature
could be no one but Mrs.Wu, their friend and gossip of that morning,
long ago....

The squat man gave an angry shout, and turned on her to wrest away the
handle.With great violence, yet with a
neat economy of motion, the Pretty Lily took one hand from her tiller,
long enough to topple him overboard with a sounding splash.Her passengers, at so prompt and visual a joke, burst into shrill,
cackling laughter.Yet more shrill, before their mood could alter, the
Pretty Lily scourged them with the tongue of a humorous woman.She held
her course, moreover; the two boats drifted so quickly apart that when
she turned, to fling a comic farewell after the white men, they could no
more than descry her face, alert and comely, and the whiteness of her
teeth.Her laughing cry still rang, the overthrown leader still
floundered in the water, when the picture blurred and vanished.Down the
wind came her words, high, voluble, quelling all further mutiny aboard
that craft of hers.The tall padre eyed Rudolph with sudden interest,
and laid his big hand on the young man's shoulder."No," answered Rudolph, and shook his head, sadly."We owe that to--some
one else."Later, while they drifted down to meet the sea and the night, he told
the story, to which all listened with profound attention, wondering at
the turns of fortune, and at this last service, rendered by a friend
they should see no more.They murmured awhile, by twos and threes huddled in corners; then lay
silent, exhausted in body and spirit.The river melted with the shore
into a common blackness, faintly hovered over by the hot, brown, sullen
evening.Unchallenged, the Hakka boat flitted past the lights of a
war-junk, so close that the curved lantern-ribs flickered thin and sharp
against a smoky gleam, and tawny faces wavered, thick of lip and stolid
of eye, round the supper fire.A greasy, bitter smell of cooking floated
after.Then no change or break in the darkness, except a dim lantern or
two creeping low in a sampan, with a fragment of talk from unseen
passers; until, as the stars multiplied overhead, the night of the land
rolled heavily astern and away from another, wider night, the stink of
the marshes failed, and by a blind sense of greater buoyancy and
sea-room, the voyagers knew that they had gained the roadstead.Ahead,
far off and lustrous, a new field of stars hung scarce higher than
their gunwale, above the rim of the world.The lowdah showed no light; and presently none was needed, for--as the
shallows gave place to deeps--the ocean boiled with the hoary,
green-gold magic of phosphorus, that heaved alongside in soft explosions
of witch-fire, and sent uncertain smoky tremors playing through the
darkness on deck.Rudolph, watching this tropic miracle, could make out
the white figure of the captain, asleep near by, under the faint
semicircle of the deck-house; and across from him, Miss Drake, still
sitting upright, as though waiting, with Flounce at her side.Landward,
against the last sage-green vapor of daylight, ran the dim range of the
hills, in long undulations broken by sharper crests, like the finny back
of leviathan basking.Over there, thought Rudolph, beyond that black shape as beyond its
guarding dragon, lay the whole mysterious and peaceful empire, with
uncounted lives going on, ending, beginning, as though he, and his sore
loss, and his heart vacant of all but grief, belonged to some
unheard-of, alien process, to Nature's most unworthy trifling.This
boatload of men and women--so huge a part of his own experience--was
like the tiniest barnacle chafed from the side of that dark,
serene monster.Rudolph stared long at the hills, and as they faded, hung his head.From that dragon he had learned much; yet now all learning was but loss.Of a sudden the girl spoke, in a clear yet guarded voice, too low to
reach the sleepers.It will be good for
both of us."Rudolph crossed silently, and stood leaning on the gunwale beside her."I thought only," he answered, "how much the hills looked so--as a
dragon."The trembling phosphorus half-revealed her face, pale and
still."I was thinking of that, in a way.It reminded me of what he
said, once--when we were walking together."To their great relief, they found themselves talking of Heywood, sadly,
but freely, and as it were in a sudden calm.Their friendship seemed,
for the moment, a thing as long established as the dragon hills.Years
afterward, Rudolph recalled her words, plainer than the fiery wonder
that spread and burst round their little vessel, or the long play of
heat-lightning which now, from time to time, wavered instantly along the
eastern sea-line."To go on with life, even when we
are alone--You will go on, I know.And again she said: "Yes,
such men as he are--a sort of Happy Warrior."And later, in her slow and
level voice: "You learned something, you say.Isn't that--what I
call--being invulnerable?When a man's greater than anything that
happens to him--"

So they talked, their speech bare and simple, but the pauses and longer
silences filled with deep understanding, solemnized by the time and the
place, as though their two lonely spirits caught wisdom from the night,
scope from the silent ocean, light from the flickering East.The flashes, meanwhile, came faster and prolonged their glory, running
behind a thin, dead screen of scalloped clouds, piercing the tropic sky
with summer blue, and ripping out the lost horizon like a long black
fibre from pulp.The two friends watched in silence, when Rudolph rose,
and moved cautiously aft.So long as the boiling witch-fire
turned their wake to golden vapor, he could not be sure; but whenever
the heat-lightning ran, and through the sere, phantasmal sail, the
lookout in the bow flashed like a sharp silhouette through wire
gauze,--then it seemed to Rudolph that another small black shape leapt
out astern, and vanished.He stood by the lowdah, watching anxiously.Time and again the ocean flickered into view, like the floor of a
measureless cavern; and still he could not tell.But at last the lowdah
also turned his head, and murmured.Their boat creaked monotonously,
drifting to leeward in a riot of golden mist; yet now another creaking
disturbed the night, in a different cadence.Another boat followed them,
rowing fast and gaining.In a brighter flash, her black sail fluttered,
unmistakable.Rudolph reached for his gun, but waited silently.Some chance fisherman, it might be, or any small craft holding the same
course along the coast.Still, he did not like the hurry of the sweeps,
which presently groaned louder and threw up nebulous fire.The
stranger's bow became an arrowhead of running gold.And here was Flounce, ready to misbehave once more.Before he could
catch her, the small white body of the terrier whipped by him, and past
the steersman.This time, however, as though cowed, she began to
whimper, and then maintained a long, trembling whine.Beside Rudolph, the compradore's head bobbed up.And in his native tongue, Ah Pat grumbled
something about ghosts.A harsh voice hailed, from the boat astern; the lowdah answered; and so
rapidly slid the deceptive glimmer of her bow, that before Rudolph knew
whether to wake his friends, or could recover, next, from the shock and
ecstasy of unbelief, a tall white figure jumped or swarmed over
the side.sounded the voice of Heywood, gravely.With fingers
that dripped gold, he tried to pat the bounding terrier.She flew up at
him, and tumbled back, in the liveliest danger of falling overboard.In a daze, Rudolph gripped the wet and shining hands,
and heard the same quiet voice: "Rest all asleep, I suppose?To-morrow will do.--Have you any money on you?Toss that
fisherman--whatever you think I'm worth.He really rowed like steam,
you know."Rudolph flung his purse into the other boat.When he turned, this man
restored from the sea had disappeared.But he had only stolen forward,
dog in arms, to sit beside Miss Drake.So quietly had all happened, that
none of the sleepers, not even the captain, was aware.Rudolph drew near
the two murmuring voices.

"--Couldn't help it, honestly," said Heywood."Can't describe, or
explain.Just something--went black inside my head, you know.""No: don't recall seeing a thing, really, until I pitched away
the--what happened to be in my hands.Losing your
head, I suppose they call it.The girl's question recalled him from his puzzle."I ran, that's all.--Oh,
yes, but I ran faster.--Not half so many as you'd suppose.Most of 'em
were away, burning your hospital.Hence those stuffed hats, Rudie, in the trench.--Only three
of the lot could run.I merely scuttled into the next bamboo, and kept
on scuttling.Oh, yes, arrow in the
shoulder--scratch.Of course, when it came dark, I stopped running, and
made for the nearest fisherman."But," protested Rudolph, wondering, "we heard shots.""Yes, I had my Webley in my belt.I _told_ you: three of
them could run."The speaker patted the terrier in his lap."My dream,
eh, little dog?You _were_ the only one to know.""No," said the girl: "I knew--all the time, that--"

Whatever she meant, Rudolph could only guess; but it was true, he
thought, that she had never once spoken as though the present meeting
were not possible, here or somewhere.Recalling this, he suddenly but
quietly stepped away aft, to sit beside the steersman, and smile in
the darkness.He did not listen, but watched the phosphorus
welling soft and turbulent in the wake, and far off, in glimpses of the
tropic light, the great Dragon weltering on the face of the waters.The
shape glimmered forth, died away, like a prodigy."Ich lieg' und besitze."And yet," thought the young man, "I have one pearl from his hoard."That girl was right: like Siegfried tempered in the grisly flood, the
raw boy was turning into a man, seasoned and invulnerable.Heywood was calling to him:--

"You must go Home with us.I've made a wonderful plan--with
the captain's fortune!A small white heap across the deck began to rise."How often," complained a voice blurred with sleep, "how often must I
tell ye--wake me, unless the ship--chart's all--Good God!"At the captain's cry, those who lay in darkness under the thatched roof
began to mutter, to rise, and grope out into the trembling light, with
sleepy cries of joy.This is often due to the
unfortunate use of the word "confirm"[1] in the Bishop's question.At
the time it was inserted, the word "confirm" meant "confess,"[2] and
referred, not to the Gift of Confirmation, but to the Candidate's
public Confession of faith, before receiving the Sacrament of
Confirmation.It had nothing whatever to do with Confirmation itself.We must not, then, confuse the preparation for Confirmation with the
Gift of Confirmation.The Sacrament itself is God's gift to the child
bestowed through the Bishop in accordance with the teaching given to
{96} the God-parents at the child's Baptism: "Ye are to take care that
this child be brought to the Bishop _to be_ confirmed _by him_".[3]

And this leads us to our second point: What Confirmation is.In the words of our Confirmation Service, it "increases and
multiplies"--i.e.strengthens or confirms Baptismal grace.It is the
ordained channel which conveys to the Baptized the "sevenfold" (i.e.complete) gift of the Holy Ghost, which was initially received in
Baptism.And this will help us to answer a question frequently asked: "If I have
been confirmed, but not Baptized, must I be Baptized?"Surely, Baptism
must _precede_ Confirmation.If {97} Confirmation increases the grace
given in Baptism, that grace must have been received before it can be
increased."And must I be 'confirmed again,' as it is said, after
Baptism?"If I had not been Baptized _before_ I presented
myself for Confirmation, I have not confirmed at all.My Baptism will
now allow me to "be presented to the Bishop once again to be confirmed
by him"--and this time in reality."Did I, then, receive no grace when
I was presented to the Bishop to be confirmed by him before?"Much
grace, surely, but not the special grace attached to the special
Sacrament of Confirmation, and guaranteed to the Confirmed.God's love overflows its channels; what
God gives, or withholds, outside those channels, it would be an
impertinence for us to say.Again, Confirmation is, in a secondary sense, a Sacrament of
Admittance.It admits the Baptized to Holy Communion."It is expedient," says the rubric after an adult Baptism,
"that every person thus Baptized should be confirmed by the Bishop so
soon after his Baptism as conveniently may be; that _so he may be
admitted to the Holy Communion_.""And {98} there shall none _be
admitted to Holy Communion_," adds the rubric after Confirmation,
"until such time as he be confirmed, or be ready and desirous to be
confirmed."For "Confirmation, or the laying on of hands," fully
admits the Baptized to that "Royal Priesthood" of the Laity,[4] of
which the specially ordained Priest is ordained to be the
representative.The Holy Sacrifice is the offering of the _whole_
Church, the universal Priesthood, not merely of the individual Priest
who is the offerer.Thus, the Confirmed can take their part in the
offering, and can assist at it, in union with the ordained Priest who
is actually celebrating.They can say their _Amen_ at the Eucharist,
or "giving of thanks," and give their responding assent to what he is
doing in their name, and on their behalf."If I am a Communicant, but have
not been confirmed, ought I to present myself for Confirmation?"First, it
legislates for the normal case, then for the abnormal.First it says:
"None shall be admitted to Holy Communion until such time as they have
been Confirmed".Then it deals with {99} exceptional cases, and adds,
"or be willing and desirous to be confirmed".Such exceptional cases
may, and do, occur; but even these may not be Communicated unless they
are both "ready" and "desirous" to be confirmed, as soon as
Confirmation can be received.So does the Church safeguard her
Sacraments, and her children."But would you," it is asked, "exclude a Dissenter from Communion,
however good and holy he may be, merely because he has not been
Confirmed?"He certainly would have very little respect for me if I
did not.If, for instance, he belonged to the Methodist Society, he
would assuredly not admit me to be a "Communicant" in that Society."No person," says his rule, "shall be suffered on any pretence to
partake of the Lord's Supper _unless he be a member of the Society_, or
receive a note of admission from the Superintendent, which note must be
renewed quarterly."And, again: "That the Table of the Lord should be
open to all comers, is surely a great discredit, and a serious peril to
any Church".[5]  And yet the Church, the Divine Society, established by
Jesus Christ Himself, is blamed, and called narrow and {100} bigoted,
if she asserts her own rule, and refuses to admit "all comers" to the
Altar.To give way on such a point would be to forfeit, and rightly to
forfeit, the respect of any law-abiding people, and would be--in many
cases, is--"a great discredit, and a serious peril" to the Church.We
have few enough rules as it is, and if those that we have are
meaningless, we may well be held up to derision.The Prayer Book makes
no provision whatever for those who are not Confirmed, and who, if able
to receive Confirmation, are neither "ready nor desirous to be
Confirmed".Confirmation is for the Baptized, and none other.The Prayer-Book
Title to the service is plain.It calls Confirmation the "laying on of
Hands upon _those that are baptized_," and, it adds, "are come to years
of discretion".First, then, Confirmation is for the Baptized, and never for the
unbaptized.Secondly, it is (as now administered[6]) for {101} "those who have come
to years of discretion," i.e.As we pray
in the Ember Collect that the Bishop may select "fit persons for the
Sacred Ministry" of the special Priesthood, and may "lay hands suddenly
on no man," so it is with Confirmation or the "laying on of hands" for
the Royal Priesthood.The Bishop must be assured by the Priest who
presents them (and who acts as his examining Chaplain), that they are
"fit persons" to be confirmed.And this fitness must be of two kinds: moral and intellectual.The candidate must "have come to years of discretion,"
i.e.he must "know to refuse the evil and choose the good".[7]  This
"age of discretion," or _competent age_, as the Catechism Rubric calls
it, is not a question of years, but of character.Our present Prayer
Book makes no allusion to any definite span of years whatever, and to
make the magic age of fifteen the minimum universal age for Candidates
is wholly illegal.At the Reformation, the English Church fixed seven
as the age for Confirmation, but our 1662 Prayer Book is more
primitive, and, taking a common-sense view, {102} leaves each case of
moral fitness to be decided on its own merits.The moral standard must
be an individual standard, and must be left, first, to the parent, who
presents the child to the Priest to be prepared; then, to the Priest
who prepares the child for Confirmation, and presents him to the
Bishop; and, lastly, to the Bishop, who must finally decide, upon the
combined testimony of the Priest and parent--and, if in doubt, upon his
own personal examination.The _intellectual_ standard is laid down in the Service for the "Public
Baptism of Infants": "So soon as he can say the Creed, the Lord's
Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, in the vulgar (i.e.his native)
tongue, and be further instructed, etc."Here, the words "can say"
obviously mean can say _intelligently_.The mere saying of the words
by rote is comparatively unimportant, though it has its use; but if
this were all, it would degrade the Candidate's intellectual status to
the capacities of a parrot.But, "as soon as" he can intelligently
comply with the Church's requirements, as soon as he has reached "a
competent age," any child may "be presented to the Bishop to be
confirmed by him".{103}

And, in the majority of cases, in these days, "the sooner, the better".It is, speaking generally, far safer to have the "child" prepared at
home--if it is a Christian home--and confirmed from home, than to risk
the preparation to the chance teaching of a Public School.With
splendid exceptions, School Confirmation is apt to get confused with
the school curriculum and school lessons.It is a sort of "extra
tuition," which, not infrequently, interferes with games or work,
without any compensating advantages in Church teaching.(IV) WHAT IS ESSENTIAL."The Laying on of Hands"--and nothing else.This act of ritual (so
familiar to the Early Church, from Christ's act in blessing little
children) was used by the Apostles,[8] and is still used by their
successors, the Bishops.It is the only act essential to a valid
Confirmation.Other, and suggestive, ceremonies have been in use in different ages,
and in different parts of the Church: but they are supplementary, not
essential.Thus, in the sub-apostolic age, ritual {104} acts expressed
very beautifully the early names for Confirmation, just as "the laying
on of Hands" still expresses the name which in the English Church
proclaims the essence of the Sacrament.For instance, Confirmation is called _The Anointing_,[9] and _The
Sealing_, and in some parts of the Church, the Priest dips his finger
in oil blessed by the Bishop, and signs or seals the child upon the
forehead with the sign of the Cross, thus symbolizing the meaning of
such names.But neither the sealing, nor the anointing, is necessary
for a valid Sacrament.Confirmation, then, "rightly and duly" administered, completes the
grace given to a child at the outset of its Christian career.It
admits the child to full membership and to full privileges in the
Christian Church.It is the ordained Channel by which the Bishop is
commissioned to convey and guarantee the special grace attached {105}
to, and only to, the Lesser Sacrament of Confirmation.[10]



[1] "Ratifying and _confirming_ the same in your own persons."[2] The word was "confess" in 1549.[3] The Greek Catechism of Plato, Metropolitan of Moscow, puts it very
clearly: "Through this holy Ordinance _the Holy Ghost descendeth upon
the person Baptized_, and confirmeth him in the grace which he received
in his Baptism according to the example of His descending upon the
disciples of Jesus Christ, and in imitation of the disciples
themselves, who after Baptism laid their hands upon the believers; by
which laying on of hands the Holy Ghost was conferred".[5] Minutes of Wesleyan Conference, 1889, p.[6] In the first ages, and, indeed, until the fifteenth century,
Confirmation followed immediately after Baptism, both in East and West,
as it still does in the East.[9] In an old seventh century Service, used in the Church of England
down to the Reformation, the Priest is directed: "Here he is to put the
Chrism (oil) on the forehead of the man, and say, 'Receive the sign of
the Holy Cross, by the Chrism of Salvation in Jesus Christ unto Eternal
Life.[10] The teaching of our Church of England, passing on the teaching of
the Church Universal, is very happily summed up in an ancient Homily of
the Church of England.It runs thus: "In Baptism the Christian was
born again spiritually, to live; in Confirmation he is made bold to
fight.There he received remission of sin; here he receiveth increase
of grace....  In Baptism he was chosen to be God's son; in Confirmation
God shall give him His Holy Spirit to... perfect him.In Baptism he
was called and chosen to be one of God's soldiers, and had his white
coat of innocency given him, and also his badge, which was the red
cross set upon his forehead...; in Confirmation he is encouraged to
fight, and to take the armour of God put upon him, which be able to
bear off the fiery darts of the devil."We have called Holy Matrimony the "_Sacrament of Perpetuation_," for it
is the ordained way in which the human race is to be perpetuated.Matrimony is the legal union between two persons,--a union which is
created by mutual consent: Holy Matrimony is that union sanctioned and
sanctified by the Church.There are three familiar names given to this union: Matrimony,
Marriage, Wedlock.Matrimony, derived from _mater_, a mother, tells of the woman's (i.e.wife-man's) "joy that a man is born into the world".Marriage, derived
from _maritus_, a husband (or house-dweller[1]), tells of the man's
place in the "hus" or house.Wedlock, derived from _weddian_, a
pledge, reminds both man and woman of the life-long pledge which each
has made "either to other".{107}

It is this Sacrament of Matrimony, Marriage, or Wedlock, that we are
now to consider.We will think of it under four headings:--

  (I) What is it for?Marriage is, as we have seen, God's method of propagating the human
race.It does this in two ways--by expansion, and by limitation.This
is seen in the New Testament ordinance, "one man for one woman".It
expands the race, but within due and disciplined limitations.Expansion, without limitation, would produce quantity without quality,
and would wreck the human race; limitation without expansion might
produce quality without quantity, but would extinguish the human race.Like every other gift of God, marriage is to be treated "soberly,
wisely, discretely," and, like every other gift, it must be used with a
due combination of freedom and restraint.Hence, among other reasons, the marriage union between one man and one
woman is {108} indissoluble.For marriage is not a mere union of
sentiment; it is not a mere terminable contract between two persons,
who have agreed to live together as long as they suit each other.It
is an _organic_ not an emotional union; "They twain shall be one
flesh," which nothing but death can divide.No law in Church or State
can unmarry the legally married.A State may _declare_ the
non-existence of the marriage union, just as it may _declare_ the
non-existence of God: but such a declaration does not affect the fact,
either in one case or the other.In England the State does, in certain cases, declare that the life-long
union is a temporary contract, and does permit "this man" or "this
woman" to live with another man, or with another woman, and, if they
choose, even to exchange husbands or wives.This is allowed by the
Divorce Act of 1857,[2] "when," writes Bishop Stubbs, "the calamitous
legislation of 1857 inflicted on English Society and English morals
{109} the most cruel blow that any conjunction of unrighteous influence
could possibly have contrived".[3]

The Church has made no such declaration.It rigidly forbids a husband
or wife to marry again during the lifetime of either party.The Law of
the Church remains the Law of the Church, overridden--but not repealed.This has led to a conflict between Church and State in a country where
they are, in theory though not in fact, united.But this is the fault
of the State, not of the Church.It is a case in which a junior
partner has acted without the consent of, or rather in direct
opposition to, the senior partner.Historically and chronologically
speaking, the Church (the senior partner) took the State (the junior
partner) into partnership, and the State, in spite of all the benefits
it has received from the Church, has taken all it could get, and has
thrown the Church over to legalize sin.It has ignored its senior
partner, and loosened the old historical bond between the two.This
the Church cannot help, and this the State fully admits, legally
absolving the Church from taking any part in its mock re-marriages.{110}

(II) WHAT IS ITS ESSENCE?The essence of matrimony is "mutual consent".The essential part of
the Sacrament consists in the words: "I, M., take thee, N.," etc.Nothing else is essential, though much else is desirable.Thus,
marriage in a church, however historical and desirable, is not
_essential_ to the validity of a marriage.Marriage at a Registry
Office (i.e.mutual consent in the presence of the Registrar) is every
bit as legally indissoluble as marriage in a church.The not uncommon
argument: "I was only married in a Registry Office, and can therefore
take advantage of the Divorce Act," is fallacious _ab initio_.[4]

Why, then, be married in, and by the Church?Apart from the history
and sentiment, for this reason.The Church is the ordained channel
through which grace to keep the marriage vow is bestowed.A special
and _guaranteed_ grace is {111} attached to a marriage sanctioned and
blest by the Church.The Church, in the name of God, "consecrates
matrimony," and from the earliest times has given its sanction and
blessing to the mutual consent.We are reminded of this in the
question: "Who _giveth_ this woman to be married to this man?"In
answer to the question, the Parent, or Guardian, presents the Bride to
the Priest (the Church's representative), who, in turn, presents her to
the Bridegroom, and blesses their union.In the Primitive Church,
notice of marriage had to be given to the Bishop of the Diocese, or his
representative,[5] in order that due inquiries might be made as to the
fitness of the persons, and the Church's sanction given or withheld.After this notice, a special service of _Betrothal_ (as well as the
actual marriage service) was solemnized.These two separate services are still marked off from each other in
(though both forming a part of) our present marriage service.The
first part of the service is held outside the chancel gates, and
corresponds to the old service of _Betrothal_.Here, too, the actual
ceremony of "mutual consent" now takes place--that part of {112} the
ceremony which would be equally valid in a Registry Office.Then
follows the second part of the service, in which the Church gives her
blessing upon the marriage.And because this part is, properly
speaking, part of the Eucharistic Office, the Bride and Bridegroom now
go to the Altar with the Priest, and there receive the Church's
Benediction, and--ideally--their first Communion after marriage.So
does the Church provide grace for her children that they may "perform
the vows they have made unto the King".The late hour for modern
weddings, and the consequent postponement[6] of Communion, has obscured
much of the meaning of the service; but a nine o'clock wedding, in
which the married couple receive the Holy Communion, followed by the
wedding breakfast, is, happily, becoming more common, and is restoring
to us one of the best of old English customs.It is easy enough to
slight old religious forms and ceremonies; but is anyone one atom
better, or happier for having neglected them?{113}

(III) WHOM IS IT FOR?Marriage is for three classes:--

(1) The unmarried--i.e.those who have never been married, or whose
marriage is (legally) dissolved by death.(2) The non-related--i.e.either by consanguinity (by blood), or
affinity (by marriage).But, is not this very
hard upon those whose marriage has been a mistake, and who have been
divorced by the State?And, above all, is it not very hard upon the
innocent party, who has been granted a divorce?It is very hard, so
hard, so terribly hard, that only those who have to deal personally,
and practically, with concrete cases, can guess how hard--hard enough
often on the guilty party, and harder still on the innocent."God
knows" it is hard, and will make it as easy as God Himself can make it,
if only self-surrender is placed before self-indulgence.We sometimes forget that legislation for
the individual may bear even harder {114} on the masses, than
legislation for the masses may bear upon the individual.And, after
all, this is not a question of "hard _versus_ easy," but of "right
_versus_ wrong".Moreover, as we are finding out, that which seems
easiest at the moment, often turns out hardest in the long run.It is
no longer contended that re-marriage after a State-divorce is that
universal Elysium which it has always been confidently assumed to be.There is, too, a positively absurd side to the present conflict between
Church and State.Some time ago, a young
girl married a man about whom she knew next to nothing, the man telling
her that marriage was only a temporary affair, and that, if it did not
answer, the State would divorce them.Wrong-doing
ensued, and a divorce was obtained.Then the girl entered into a
State-marriage with another man.A
divorce was again applied for, but this time was refused.Eventually,
the girl left her State-made husband, and ran away with her real
husband.In other words, she eloped with her own husband.But what is
her position to-day?In the eyes of the State, she is now living with
a man who is not {115} her husband.Her State-husband is still alive,
and can apply, at any moment, for an order for the restitution of
conjugal rights--however unlikely he is to get it.Further, if in the
future she has any children by her real husband (unless she has been
married again to him, after divorce from her State-husband) these
children will be illegitimate.This is the sort of muddle the Divorce
Act has got us into.One course, and only one course, is open to the
Church--to disentangle itself from all question of extending the powers
of the Act on grounds of inequality, or any other real (and sometimes
very real) or fancied hardship, and to consistently fight for the
repeal of the Act.This, it will be said, is _Utopian_.It
is the business of the Church to aim at the Utopian.Her whole history
shows that she is safest, as well as most successful, when aiming at
what the world derides.One question remains: Is not the present Divorce Law "one law for the
rich and another for the poor"?This is its sole
merit, if merit it can have.It does, at least, partially protect the
poor from sin-made-easy--a condition which money has bought for the
rich.If the State abrogated the Sixth {116} Commandment for the rich,
and made it lawful for a rich man to commit murder, it would at least
be no demerit if it refused to extend the permit to the poor.But, secondly, marriage is for the non-related--non-related, that is,
in two ways, by Consanguinity, and Affinity.(_a_) By _Consanguinity_.Consanguinity is of two kinds, lineal and
collateral._Lineal_ Consanguinity[7] is blood relationship "in a
_direct_ line," i.e._Collateral_
Consanguinity is blood relationship from a common ancestor, but not in
a direct line.The law of Consanguinity has not, at the present moment, been attacked,
and is still the law of the land.Affinity[8] is near relationship by marriage.It
is of three kinds: (1) _Direct_, i.e.between a husband and his wife's
blood relations, and between a wife and her husband's blood relations;
(2) _Secondary_, i.e.between a husband {117} and his wife's relations
by marriage; (3) _Collateral_, i.e.between a husband and the relations
of his wife's relations.In case of Affinity, the State has broken
faith with the Church without scruple, and the _Deceased Wife's Sister
Bill_[9] is the result.So has it

  brought confusion to the Table round.The question is sometimes asked, whether the State can alter the
Church's law without her consent.An affirmative answer would reduce
whatever union still remains between them to its lowest possible term,
and would place the Church in a position which no Nonconformist body
would tolerate for a day.The further question, as to whether the
State can order the Church to Communicate persons who have openly and
deliberately broken her laws, needs no discussion.No thinking person
seriously contends that it can.(3) _For the Full-Aged_.No boy under 14, and no girl under 12, can contract a legal marriage
either with, or without the consent of Parents or Guardians.No man
{118} or woman under 21 can do so against the consent of Parents or
Guardians.(IV) WHAT ARE ITS SAFEGUARDS?These are, mainly, two: _Banns_ and _Licences_--both intended to secure
the best safeguard of all, _publicity_.This publicity is secured,
first, by Banns.The word is the plural form of _Ban_, "a proclamation".The object of
this proclamation is to "ban" an improper marriage.In the case of marriage after Banns, in order to secure publicity:--

(1) Each party must reside[10] for twenty-one days in the parish where
the Banns are being published.(2) The marriage must be celebrated in one of the two parishes in which
the Banns have been published.{119}

(3) Seven days' previous notice of publication must be given to the
clergy by whom the Banns are to be published--though the clergy may
remit this length of notice if they choose.(4) The Banns must be published on three separate (though not
necessarily successive) Sundays.(5) Before the marriage, a certificate of publication must be presented
to the officiating clergyman, from the clergyman of the other parish in
which the Banns were published.(6) Banns only hold good for three months.After this period, they
must be again published three times before the marriage can take place.(7) Banns may be forbidden on four grounds: If either party is married
already; or is related by consanguinity or affinity; or is under age;
or is insane.(8) Banns published in false names invalidate a marriage, if both
parties are cognisant of the fact before the marriage takes place, i.e.if they wilfully intend to defeat the law, but not otherwise.There are two kinds of Marriage Licence, an Ordinary, or Common
Licence, and a Special Licence.{120}

An _Ordinary Licence_, costing about L2, is granted by the Bishop, or
Ordinary, in lieu of Banns, either through his Chancellor, or a
"Surrogate," i.e.In marriage by Licence, three points may
be noticed:--

(1) One (though only one) of the parties must reside in the parish
where the marriage is to be celebrated, for fifteen days previous to
the marriage.(2) One of the parties must apply for the Licence in person, not in
writing.(3) A licence only holds good for three months.A _Special Licence_, costing about L30, can only be obtained from the
Archbishop of Canterbury,[11] and is only granted after special and
minute inquiry.The points here to notice are:--

(1) Neither party need reside in the parish where the marriage is to be
solemnized.(2) The marriage may be celebrated in any Church, whether licensed or
unlicensed[12] for marriages.(3) It may be celebrated at any time of the day.It may be added that
if any clergyman {121} celebrates a marriage without either Banns or
Licence (or upon a Registrar's Certificate), he commits a felony, and
is liable to fourteen years' penal servitude.[13]

Other safeguards there are, such as:--

_The Time for Marriages_.--Marriages must not be celebrated before 8
A.M., or after 3 P.M., so as to provide a reasonable chance of
publicity._The Witnesses to a Marriage_.--Two witnesses, at least, must be
present, in addition to the officiating clergyman._The Marriage Registers_.--The officiating clergyman must enter the
marriage in two Registers provided by the State._The Signing of the Registers_.--The bride and bridegroom must sign
their names in the said Registers immediately after the ceremony, as
well as the two witnesses and the officiating clergyman.If either
party wilfully makes any false statement with regard to age, condition,
etc., he or she is guilty of perjury.Such are some of the wise safeguards provided by both Church and State
for the Sacrament of Marriage.Their object is to prevent the {122}
marriage state being entered into "lightly, unadvisedly, or wantonly,"
to secure such publicity as will prevent clandestine marriages,[14] and
will give parents, and others with legal status, an opportunity to
lodge legal objections.Great is the solemnity of the Sacrament in which is "signified and
represented the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and His Church".[1] Husband--from _hus_, a house, and _buan_, to dwell.[2] Until fifty-three years ago an Act of Parliament was necessary for
a divorce.In 1857 _The Matrimonial Causes Act_ established the
Divorce Court.In 1873 the _Indicature Act_ transferred it to a
division of the High Court--the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty
Division.[3] "Visitation Charges," p.[4] It is a common legal error that seven years effective separation
between husband and wife entitles either to remarry, and hundreds of
women who have lost sight of their husbands for seven years innocently
commit bigamy.Probably the mistake comes from the fact that
_prosecution_ for bigamy does not hold good in such a case.But this
does not legalize the bigamous marriage or legitimize the children.[5] The origin of Banns.[6] The Rubric says: "It is convenient that the new-married persons
receive the Holy Communion _at the time of their marriage_, or at the
first opportunity after their marriage," thus retaining, though
releasing, the old rule.[7] Consanguinity--from _cum_, together, and _sanguineus_, relating to
blood.[8] Affinity--from _ad_, near, and _finis_, a boundary.[9] See a most helpful paper read by Father Puller at the E.C.U.Anniversary Meeting, and reported in "The Church Times" of 17 June,
1910.[10] There seems to be no legal definition of the word "reside".The
law would probably require more than leaving a bag in a room, hired for
twenty-one days, as is often done.It must be remembered that the
object of the law is _publicity_--that is, the avoidance of a
clandestine marriage, which marriage at a Registry Office now
frequently makes so fatally easy.[12] Such as, for example, Royal Chapels, St.Paul's Cathedral, Eton
College Chapel, etc.[14] It will be remembered that runaway marriages were, in former days,
frequently celebrated at Gretna Green, a Scotch village in
Dumfriesshire, near the English border.{123}

CHAPTER X.

HOLY ORDER.The Second Sacrament of Perpetuation is Holy Order.As the Sacrament
of Marriage perpetuates the human race, so the Sacrament of Order
perpetuates the Priesthood.Holy Order, indeed, perpetuates the
Sacraments themselves.It is the ordained channel through which the
Sacramental life of the Church is continued.Holy Order, then, was instituted for the perpetuation of those
Sacraments which depend upon Apostolic Succession.It makes it
possible for the Christian laity to be Confirmed, Communicated,
Absolved.Thus, the Christian Ministry is a great deal more than a
body of men, chosen as officers might be chosen in the army or navy.It is the Church's media for the administration of the Sacraments of
Salvation.To say this does not assert that God cannot, and does not,
save and sanctify souls in any other way; but it does assert, as
Scripture does, that the {124} Christian Ministry is the authorized and
ordained way.In this Ministry, there are three orders, or degrees: Bishops, Priests,
and Deacons.In the words of the Prayer Book: "It is evident unto all
men, diligently reading Holy Scripture and ancient Authors, that, from
the Apostles' time, there have been these Orders of Ministers in
Christ's Church; Bishops, Priests, and Deacons".[1]



(I) BISHOPS.Jesus Christ, "the Shepherd and Bishop of
our souls".When, and where, was the first Ordination?In the Upper
Chamber, when He, the Universal Bishop, Himself ordained the first
Apostles.When was {125} the second Ordination?When these Apostles
ordained Matthias to succeed Judas.This was the first link in the
chain of Apostolic Succession.In apostolic days,
Timothy was ordained, with episcopal jurisdiction over Ephesus; Titus,
over Crete; Polycarp (the friend of St.John), over Smyrna; and then,
later on, Linus, over Rome.And so the great College of Bishops
expands until, in the second century, we read in a well-known writer,
St.Irenaeus: "We can reckon up lists of Bishops ordained in the
Churches from the Apostles to our time".Link after link, the chain of
succession lengthens "throughout all the world," until it reaches the
Early British Church, and then, in 597, the English Church, through the
consecration of Augustine,[2] first Archbishop of Canterbury, and in
1903 of Randall Davidson his ninety-fourth successor.And this is the history of every ordination in the Church to-day."It
is through the Apostolic Succession," said the late Bishop Stubbs to
his ordination Candidates, "that I am empowered, through the long line
of mission and Commission {126} from the Upper Chamber at Jerusalem, to
lay my hands upon you and send you."[3]

How does a Priest become a Bishop?In the Church of England he goes
through four stages:--

  (1) He is _nominated_ by the Crown.(2) He is _elected_ by the Church.(3) His election is _confirmed_ by the Archbishop.(4) He is _consecrated_ by the Episcopate.(1) He is _nominated_ by the Crown.This is in accordance with the
immemorial custom of this realm.In these days, the Prime Minister
(representing the people) proposes the name of a Priest to the King,
who accepts or rejects the recommendation.If he accepts it, the King
nominates the selected Priest to the Church for election, and
authorizes the issue of legal documents for such election.This is
called _Conge d'elire_, "leave to elect".(2) He is _elected_ by the Church.The King's {127} nominee now comes
before the Dean and Chapter (representing the Church), and the Church
either elects or rejects him.If the
nominee is elected, what is called his "Confirmation" follows--that
is:--

(3) His election is _confirmed_ by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
according to a right reserved to him by _Magna Charta_.Before
confirming the election, the Archbishop, or his representative, sits in
public, generally at Bow Church, Cheapside, to hear legal objections
from qualified laity against the election.Objections were of late, it
will be remembered, made, and overruled, in the cases of Dr.Then, if duly nominated, elected, and confirmed,--

(4) He is _consecrated_ by the Episcopate.To safeguard the
Succession, three Bishops, at least, are required for the Consecration
of another Bishop, though one would secure a valid Consecration.No
Priest can be Consecrated Bishop under the age of thirty.Very
carefully does the Church safeguard admission to the Episcopate.{128}

_Homage._

After Consecration, the Bishop "does homage,"[4] i.e.he says that he,
like any other subject (ecclesiastic or layman), is the King's
"_homo_".He does homage, not for any
spiritual gift, but for "all the possessions, and profette spirituall
and temporall belongyng to the said...[5]  The
_temporal_ possessions include such things as his house, revenue, etc.But what is meant by doing homage for _spiritual_ possessions?Does
not this admit the claim that the King can, as Queen Elizabeth is
reported to have said, make or unmake a Bishop?Spiritual
_possessions_ do not here mean spiritual _powers_,--powers which can be
conferred by the Episcopate alone.{129} The "spiritual possessions"
for which a Bishop "does homage" refer to fees connected with spiritual
things, such as Episcopal Licences, Institutions to Benefices, Trials
in the Ecclesiastical Court, Visitations--fees, by the way, which, with
very rare exceptions, do not go into the Bishop's own pocket!_Jurisdiction._

What is meant by Episcopal Jurisdiction?Jurisdiction is of two kinds,
_Habitual_ and _Actual_.Habitual Jurisdiction is the Jurisdiction given to a Bishop to exercise
his office in the Church at large.It is conveyed with Consecration,
and is given to the Bishop as a Bishop of the Catholic Church.Thus an
Episcopal act, duly performed, would be valid, however irregular,
outside the Bishop's own Diocese, and in any part of the Church._Actual Jurisdiction_ is this universal Jurisdiction limited to a
particular area, called a Diocese.To this area, a Bishop's right to
exercise his Habitual Jurisdiction is, for purposes of order and
business, confined.The next order in the Ministry is the Priesthood.{130}

(II) PRIESTS.No one can read the Prayer-Book Office for the _Ordering of Priests_
without being struck by its contrast to the ordinary conception of
Priesthood by the average Englishman.The Bishop's words in the
Ordination Service: "Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of
a Priest in the Church of God," must surely mean more than that a
Priest should try to be a good organizer, a good financier, a good
preacher, or good at games--though the better he is at all these, the
better it may be.But the gift of the Holy Ghost for "the Office and
Work of a Priest" must mean more than this.We may consider it in connexion with four familiar English clerical
titles: _Priest, Minister, Parson, Clergyman_._Priest._

According to the Prayer Book, a Priest, or Presbyter, is ordained to do
three things, which he, and he alone, can do: to Absolve, to
Consecrate, to Bless.He, and he alone, can _Absolve_.It is the day of his
Ordination to the Priesthood.He is saying Matins as a Deacon just
_before_ his {131} Ordination, and he is forbidden to pronounce the
Absolution: he is saying Evensong just _after_ his Ordination, and he
is ordered to pronounce the Absolution.He, and he alone, can _Consecrate_.If a Deacon pretends to Consecrate
the Elements at the Blessed Sacrament, not only is his act sacrilege
and invalid, but even by the law of the land he is liable to a penalty
of L100.[6]

He, and he alone, can give the _Blessing_--i.e.The right of Benediction belongs to him as part of his
Ministerial Office.The Blessing pronounced by a Deacon might be the
personal blessing of a good and holy man, just as the blessing of a
layman--a father blessing his child--might be of value as such.In
each case it would be a personal act.But a Priest does not bless in
his own name, but in the name of the Whole Church.It is an official,
not a personal act: he conveys, not his own, but the Church's blessing
to the people.Hence, the valid Ordination of a Priest is of essential importance to
the laity.{132}

But there is another aspect of "the Office and Work of a Priest in the
Church of God".This we see in the word



_Minister._

The Priest not only ministers before God on behalf of his people, but
he ministers to his people on behalf of God.In this aspect of the
Priesthood, he ministers God's gifts to the laity.If, as a Priest, he
pleads the One Sacrifice on behalf of the people, as a Minister he
feeds the people upon the one Sacrifice.His chief ministerial duty is
to minister to the people--to give them Baptism, Absolution, Holy
Communion; to minister to all their spiritual needs whenever, and
wherever, he is needed.It is, surely, a sad necessity that this ministerial "office and work"
should be so often confused with finance, doles, charities, begging
sermons, committees, etc.In all such things he is, indeed, truly
serving and ministering; but he is often obliged to place them in the
wrong order of importance, and so dim the sight of the laity to his
real position, and not infrequently make his spiritual ministrations
unacceptable.A well-known and London-wide respected Priest said {133}
shortly before he died, that he had almost scattered his congregation
by the constant "begging sermons" which he hated, but which necessity
made imperative.The laity are claiming (and rightly claiming) the
privilege of being Church workers, and are preaching (and rightly
preaching) that "the Clergy are not the Church".If only they would
practise what they preach, and relieve the Clergy of all Church
finance, they need never listen to another "begging sermon" again.So
doing, they would rejoice the heart of the Clergy, and fulfil one of
their true functions as laity.This is one of the most beautiful of all the clerical names, only it
has become smirched by common use.The word Parson is derived from _Persona_, a _person_.The Parson is
_the_ Person--the Person who represents God in the Parish.It is not
his own person, or position, that he stands for, but the position and
Person of his Master.Paul, he can say, "I magnify mine
office," and probably the best way to magnify his office will be to
minimize himself.The outward marks of {134} respect still shown to
"the Parson" in some places, are not necessarily shown to the person
himself (though often, thank God, they may be), but are meant, however
unconsciously, to honour the Person he represents--just as the lifting
of the hat to a woman is not, of necessity, a mark of respect to the
individual woman, but a tribute to the Womanhood she represents.The Parson, then, is, or should be, the official person, the standing
element in the parish, who reminds men of God._Clergyman._

The word is derived from the Greek _kleros_,[7] "a lot," and conveys
its own meaning.According to some, it takes us back in thought to the
first Apostolic Ordination, when "they cast _lots_, and the _lot_ fell
upon Matthias".It reminds us that, as Matthias "was numbered with the
eleven," so a "Clergyman" is, at his Ordination, numbered with that
long list of "Clergy" who trace their spiritual pedigree to Apostolic
days.{135}

_Ordination Safeguards._

"Seeing then," run the words of the Ordination Service, "into how high
a dignity, and how weighty an Office and Charge" a Priest is called,
certain safeguards surround his Ordination, both for his own sake, and
for the sake of his people._Age._

No Deacon can, save under very exceptional circumstances, be ordained
Priest before he is 24, and has served at least a year in the Diaconate._Fitness._

This fitness, as in Confirmation, will be intellectual and moral.His
_intellectual_ fitness is tested by the Bishop's Examining Chaplain
some time before the Ordination to the Priesthood, and, in doubtful
cases, by the Bishop himself.His _moral_ fitness is tested by the Publication during Service, in the
Church where he is Deacon, of his intention to offer himself as a
Candidate for the Priesthood.To certify that this has been done, this
Publication must be signed by the Churchwarden, representing the {136}
laity, and by the Incumbent, representing the Clergy and responsible to
the Bishop.Further safeguard is secured by letters of Testimony from three
Beneficed Clergy, who have known the Candidate well either for the past
three years, or during the term of his Diaconate.Finally, at the very last moment, in the Ordination Service itself, the
Bishop invites the laity, if they know "any impediment or notable
crime" disqualifying the Candidate from being ordained Priest, to "come
forth in the Name of God, and show what the crime or impediment is".For many obvious reasons, but specially for
one._The Indelibility of Orders._

Once a Priest, always a Priest.When once the Bishop has ordained a
Deacon to the Priesthood, there is no going back.The law,
ecclesiastical or civil, may deprive him of the right to _exercise_ his
Office, but no power can deprive him of the Office itself.For instance, to safeguard the Church, and for {137} the sake of the
laity, a Priest may, for various offences, be what is commonly called
"unfrocked".He may be degraded, temporarily suspended, or permanently
forbidden to _officiate_ in any part of the Church; but he does not
cease to be a Priest.Any Priestly act, rightly and duly performed,
would be valid, though irregular.It would be for the people's good,
though it would be to his own hurt.Again: by _The Clerical Disabilities Act_ of 1870, a Priest may, by the
law of the land, execute a "Deed of Relinquishment," and, as far as the
law is concerned, return to lay life.This would enable him legally to
undertake lay work which the law forbids to the Clergy.[8]

He may, in consequence, regain his legal rights as a layman, and lose
his legal rights as a Priest; but he does not cease to be a Priest.The law can only touch his civil status, and cannot touch his priestly
"character".Hence, no securities can be superfluous to safeguard the irrevocable.{138}

_Jurisdiction._

As in the case of the Bishops, a Priest's jurisdiction is
twofold--_habitual_ and _actual_.Ordination confers on him _habitual_
jurisdiction, i.e.the power to exercise his office, to Absolve, to
Consecrate, to Bless, in the "Holy Church throughout the world".And,
as in the case of Bishops, for purposes of ecclesiastical order and
discipline, this Habitual Jurisdiction is limited to the sphere in
which the Bishop licenses him."Take thou authority," says the Bishop,
"to preach the word of God, and to minister the Sacraments _in the
congregation where thou shalt be lawfully appointed thereunto_."This
is called _Actual_ Jurisdiction._The Essence of the Sacrament._

The absolutely essential part of Ordination is the Laying on of Hands
(1 Tim.Various other and beautiful
ceremonies have, at different times, and in different places,
accompanied the essential Rite.Sometimes, and in some parts of the
Church, Unction, or anointing the Candidate with oil, has been used:
sometimes Ordination has been accompanied with the delivery of a Ring,
the Paten {139} and Chalice, the Bible, or the Gospels, the Pastoral
Staff (to a Bishop),--all edifying ceremonies, but not essentials.The word comes from the Greek _diakonos_, a
servant, and exactly describes the Office.Originally, a permanent
Order in the Church, the Diaconate is now, in the Church of England,
generally regarded as a step to the Priesthood.But
it is as this step, or preparatory stage, that we have to consider it.Considering the importance of this first step in the Ministry, both to
the man himself, and to the people, it is well that the laity should
know what safeguards are taken by the Bishop to secure "fit persons to
serve in the sacred ministry of the Church"[9]--and should realize
their own great responsibility in the matter.(1) _The Age._

No layman can be made a Deacon under 23.{140}

(2) The Preliminaries.The chief preliminary is the selection of the Candidate.The burden of
selection is shared by the Bishop, Clergy and Laity.The Bishop must,
of course, be the final judge of the Candidate's fitness, but _the
evidence upon which he bases his judgment_ must very largely be
supplied by the Laity.We pray in the Ember Collect that he "may lay hands suddenly on no man,
but make choice of _fit persons_".It is well that the Laity should
remember that they share with the Bishop and Clergy in the
responsibility of choice.For this fitness will, as in the case of the Priest, be moral and
intellectual.It will be _moral_--and it is here that the responsibility of the laity
begins.For, in addition to private inquiries made by the Bishop, the
laity are publicly asked, in the church of the parish where the
Candidate resides, to bear testimony to the integrity of his character.This publication is called the _Si quis_, from the Latin of the first
two words of publication ("if any..."), and it is repeated by the
Bishop in open church in the Ordination Service.The {141} absence of
any legal objection by the laity is the testimony of the people to the
Candidate's fitness.This throws upon the laity a full share of
responsibility in the choice of the Candidate.Their responsibility in
giving evidence is only second to that of the Bishop, whose decision
rests upon the evidence they give.Then, there is the testimony of the Clergy.No layman is accepted by
the Bishop for Ordination without _Letters Testimonial_--i.e.the
testimony of three beneficed Clergymen, to whom he is well known.These Clergy must certify that "we have had opportunity of observing
his conduct, and we do believe him, in our consciences, and as to his
moral conduct, a fit person to be admitted to the Sacred Ministry".Each signature must be countersigned by the signatory's own Bishop, who
thus guarantees the Clergyman's moral fitness to certify.Lastly, comes the Bishop himself, who, from first to last, is in close
touch with the Candidate, and who almost invariably helps to prepare
him personally in his own house during the week before his Ordination.In addition to University testimony,
evidence of the Candidate's {142} intellectual fitness is given to the
Bishop, as in the case of Priests, by his Examining Chaplains.Some
months before the Ordination, the Candidate is examined, and the
Examiner's Report sent in to the Bishop.The standard of intellectual
fitness has differed at various ages, in different parts of the Church,
and no one standard can be laid down.Assuming that the average
proportion of people in a parish will be (on a generous calculation) as
twelve Jurymen to one Judge, the layman called to the Diaconate should,
at least, be equal in intellectual attainment to "the layman" called to
the Bar.It does sometimes happen that evidence is given by Clergy, or laity,
which leads the Bishop to reject the Candidate on moral grounds.It
does sometimes happen that the Candidate is rejected or postponed on
intellectual grounds.It does, it must, sometimes happen that mistakes
are made: God alone is infallible.But, if due care is taken, publicly
and privately, and if the laity, as well as the Clergy, do their duty,
the Bishop's risk of a wrong judgment is reduced to a very small
minimum.A "fit" Clergy is so much the concern of the laity, that they may well
be reminded of their {143} parts and duties in the Ordination of a
Deacon.Liddon says, "the strength of the Church does not
consist in the number of pages in its 'Clerical Directory,' but in the
sum total of the moral and spiritual force which she has at her
command".[1] "The Threefold Ministry," writes Bishop Lightfoot, "can be traced
to Apostolic direction; and, short of an express statement, we can
possess no better assurance of a Divine appointment, or, at least, a
Divine Sanction."And he adds, speaking of his hearty desire for union
with the Dissenters, "we cannot surrender for any immediate advantages
the threefold Ministry which we have inherited from Apostolic times,
and which is the historic backbone of the Church" ("Ep.[2] The Welsh Bishops did not transmit Episcopacy to us, but rather
came into us.[3] In a book called _Registrum Sacrum Anglicanum_, Bishop Stubbs has
traced the name, date of Consecration, names of Consecrators, and in
most cases place of Consecration, of every Bishop in the Church of
England from the Consecration of Augustine.[4] The Bishops are one of the three Estates of the Realm--Lords
Spiritual, Lords Temporal, and Commons (not, as is so often said, King,
Lords, and Commons).The Archbishop of Canterbury is the first Peer of
the Realm, and has precedency immediately after the blood royal.The
Archbishop of York has precedency over all Dukes, not being of royal
blood, and over all the great officers of State, except the Lord
Chancellor.He has the privilege of crowning the Queen Consort."Encyclopedia of the Laws of England," vol.See Phillimore's "Ecclesiastical Law,"
vol.[7] But see Skeat, whose references are to [Greek: kleros], "a lot," in
late Greek, and the Clergy whose portion is the Lord (Deut.The [Greek: kleros] is thus the portion
rather than the circumstance by which it is obtained, i.e.[8] For example: farming more than a certain number of acres, or going
into Parliament.We deal now with the two last Sacraments under consideration--Penance
and Unction.Penance is for the
healing of the soul, and indirectly of the body: Unction is for the
healing of the body, and indirectly of the soul.Thomas Aquinas, "has been instituted to
produce one special effect, although it may produce, as consequences,
other effects besides."It is so with these two Sacraments.Body and
Soul are so involved, that what directly affects the one must
indirectly affect the other.Thus, the direct effect of Penance on the
soul must indirectly affect the body, and the direct effect of Unction
on the body must indirectly affect the soul.{145}

_Penance._

The word is derived from the Latin _penitentia_, penitence, and its
root-meaning (_poena_, punishment) suggests a punitive element in all
real repentance.It is used as a comprehensive term for confession of
sin, punishment for sin, and the Absolution, or Remission of Sins.As
Baptism was designed to recover the soul from original or inherited
sin, so Penance was designed to recover the soul from actual or wilful
sin....[1]  It is not, as in the case of infant Baptism, administered
wholly irrespective of free will: it must be freely sought ("if he
humbly and heartily desire it"[2]) before it can be freely bestowed.Thus, Confession must precede Absolution, and Penitence must precede
and accompany Confession._Confession._

Here we all start on common ground.the necessity of Confession (1) _to God_ ("If we confess our sins, He
is faithful and just to forgive us our sins") {146} and (2) _to man_
("Confess your faults one to another").Further, we all agree that
confession to man is in reality confession to God ("Against Thee, _Thee
only_, have I sinned").Our only ground of difference is, not
_whether_ we ought to confess, but _how_ we ought to confess.It is a
difference of method rather than of principle.There are two ways of confessing sins (whether to God, or to man), the
informal, and the formal.Most of us use one way; some the other; many
both._Informal Confession_.--Thank God, I can use this way at any, and at
every, moment of my life.If I have sinned, I need wait for no formal
act of Confession; but, as I am, and where I am, I can make my
Confession.Then, and there, I can claim the Divine response to the
soul's three-fold _Kyrie_: "Lord, have mercy upon me; Christ, have
mercy upon me; Lord, have mercy upon me".But do I never want--does
God never want--anything more than this?The soul is not always
satisfied with such an easy method of going to Confession.It needs at
times something more impressive, something perhaps less superficial,
less easy going.It demands more time for {147} deepening thought, and
greater knowledge of what it has done, before sin's deadly hurt cuts
deep enough to produce real repentance, and to prevent repetition.At
such times, it cries for something more formal, more solemn, than
instantaneous confession.It needs, what the Prayer Book calls, "a
special Confession of sins"._Formal Confession_.--Hence our Prayer Book provides two formal Acts of
Confession, and suggests a third.Two of these are for public use, the
third for private.In Matins and Evensong, and in the Eucharistic Office, a form of
"_general_ confession" is provided.Both forms are in the first person
plural throughout.Clearly, their primary intention is, not to make us
merely think of, or confess, our own personal sins, but the sins of the
Church,--and our own sins, as members of the Church.It is "we" have
sinned, rather than "I" have sinned.Such formal language might,
otherwise, at times be distressingly unreal,--when, e.g., not honestly
feeling that the "burden" of our own personal sin "is intolerable," or
when making a public Confession in church directly after a personal
Confession in private.In the Visitation of the Sick, the third mode of {148} formal
Confession is suggested, though the actual words are naturally left to
the individual penitent.The Prayer Book no longer speaks in the
plural, or of "a _general_ Confession," but it closes, as it were, with
the soul, and gets into private, personal touch with it: "Here shall
the sick man be moved to make a _special_ Confession of his sins, if he
feel his conscience troubled with any weighty matter; after which
Confession, the Priest shall absolve him (if he humbly and heartily
desire it) after this sort".This Confession is to be both free and
formal: formal, for it is to be made before the Priest in his
"_ministerial_" capacity; free, for the penitent is to be "moved" (not
"compelled") to confess.Notice, he _is_ to be moved; but then (though
not till then) he is free to accept, or reject, the preferred means of
grace.Sacraments are open to all;
they are forced on none.They are love-tokens of the Sacred Heart;
free-will offerings of His Royal Bounty.These, then, are the two methods of Confession at our disposal.God is
"the Father of an infinite Majesty".In _informal_ Confession, the
sinner goes to God as his _Father_,--as the Prodigal, after doing
penance in the far country, went {149} to his father with "_Father_, I
have sinned".In _formal_ Confession, the sinner goes to God as to the
Father of an _infinite Majesty_,--as David went to God through Nathan,
God's ambassador.It is a fearful responsibility to hinder any soul from using either
method; it is a daring risk to say: "Because one method alone appeals
to me, therefore no other method shall be used by you".God multiplies
His methods, as He expands His love: and if any "David" is drawn to say
"I have sinned" before the appointed "Nathan," and, through prejudice
or ignorance, such an one is hindered from so laying his sins on Jesus,
God will require that soul at the hinderer's hands._Absolution._

It is the same with Absolution as with Confession.Here, too, we start
on common ground.All agree that "_God only_ can forgive sins," and
half our differences come because this is not recognized.Whatever
form Confession takes, the penitent exclaims: "_To Thee only it
appertaineth to forgive sins_".Pardon through the Precious Blood is
the one, and only, source of {150} forgiveness.Our only difference,
then, is as to God's _methods_ of forgiveness.Some seem to limit His love, to tie forgiveness down to one, and
only one, method of absolution--direct, personal, instantaneous,
without any ordained Channel such as Christ left.Direct, God's pardon
certainly is; personal and instantaneous, it certainly can be; without
any sacramental _media_, it certainly may be.But we dare not limit
what God has not limited; we dare not deny the existence of ordained
channels, because God can, and does, act without such channels.He has
opened an ordained fountain for sin and uncleanness as a superadded
gift of love, and in the Ministry of reconciliation He conveys pardon
through this channel.At the most solemn moment of his life, when a Deacon is ordained
Priest, the formal terms of his Commission to the Priesthood run thus:
"Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of a Priest in the
Church of God, now committed unto thee by the Imposition of our hands.Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins thou
dost retain, they are retained."No
Priest dare hide his commission, play with {151} the plain meaning of
the words, or conceal from others a "means of grace" which they have a
blessed right to know of, and to use.But what is the good of this Absolution, if God can forgive without it?There must, therefore, be some
superadded grace attached to this particular ordinance.It is not left merely to comfort the penitent (though that it
does), nor to let him hear from a fellow-sinner that his sins are
forgiven him (though that he does); but it is left, like any other
Sacrament, as a special means of grace.It is the ordained Channel
whereby God's pardon is conveyed to (and only to) the penitent sinner."No penitence, no pardon," is the law of Sacramental Absolution.The Prayer Book, therefore, preaches the power of formal, as well as
informal, Absolution.There are in it three forms of Absolution,
varying in words but the same in power.The appropriating power of the
penitent may, and does, vary, according to the sincerity of his
confession: Absolution is in each case the same.It is man's capacity
to receive it, not God's power in giving it, that varies.Thus, all
three Absolutions in the {152} Prayer Book are of the same force,
though our appropriating capacity in receiving them may differ.This
capacity will probably be less marked at Matins and Evensong than at
Holy Communion, and at Holy Communion than in private Confession,
because it will be less personal, less thorough.The words of
Absolution seem to suggest this.The first two forms are in the plural
("pardon and deliver _you_"), and are thrown, as it were, broadcast
over the Church: the third is special ("forgive _thee_ thine offences")
and is administered to the individual.But the formal act is the same
in each case; and to stroll late into church, as if the Absolution in
Matins and Evensong does not matter, may be to incur a very distinct
loss.When, and how often, formal "special Confession" is to be used, and
formal Absolution to be sought, is left to each soul to decide.The
two special occasions which the Church of England emphasizes (without
limiting) are before receiving the Holy Communion, and when sick.Before Communion, the Prayer Book counsels its use for any disquieted
conscience; and the {153} Rubric which directs intending Communicants
to send in their names to the Parish Priest the day before making their
Communion, still bears witness to its framers' intention--that known
sinners might not be communicated without first being brought to a
state of repentance.The sick, also, after being directed to make their wills,[3] and
arrange their temporal affairs, are further urged to examine their
spiritual state; to make a special confession; and to obtain the
special grace, in the special way provided for them.And, adds the
Rubric, "men should often be put in remembrance to take order for the
settling of their temporal estates, while they are in health"--and if
of the temporal, how much more of their spiritual estate._Direction._

But, say some, is not all this very weakening to the soul?They are,
probably, mixing up two things,--the Divine Sacrament of forgiveness
which (rightly used) must be strengthening, and the human appeal for
direction which (wrongly used) may be weakening.{154}

But "direction" is not necessarily part of Penance.The Prayer Book
lays great stress upon it, and calls it "ghostly counsel and advice,"
but it is neither Confession nor Absolution.It has its own place in
the Prayer Book;[4] but it has not, necessarily, anything whatever to
do with the administration of the Sacrament.Direction may, or may
not, be good for the soul.It largely depends upon the character of
the penitent, and the wisdom of the Director.It is quite possible for
the priest to over-direct, and it is fatally possible for the penitent
to think more of direction than of Absolution.It is quite possible to
obscure the Sacramental side of Penance with a human craving for
"ghostly counsel and advice".Satan would not be Satan if it were not
so.But this "ghostly," or spiritual, "counsel and advice" has saved
many a lad, and many a man, from many a fall; and when rightly sought,
and wisely given is, as the Prayer Book teaches, a most helpful adjunct
to Absolution.Only, it is not, necessarily, a part of "going to
Confession".{155}

_Indulgences._

The abuse of the Sacrament is another, and not unnatural objection to
its use; and it often gets mixed up with Mediaeval teaching about
Indulgences.An _Indulgence_ is exactly what the word suggests--the act of
indulging, or granting a favour.In Roman theology, an Indulgence is
the remission of temporal punishment due to sin after Absolution.It
is either "plenary," i.e.when the whole punishment is remitted, or
"partial," when some of it is remitted.At corrupt periods of Church
history, these Indulgences have been bought for money,[5] thus making
one law for the rich, and another for the poor.Very naturally, the
scandals connected with such buying and selling raised suspicions
against the Sacrament with which Indulgences were associated.[6]  But
Indulgences have nothing in the world to do with the right use of the
lesser Sacrament of Penance.{156}

_Amendment._

The promise of Amendment is an essential part of Penance.It is a
necessary element in all true contrition.Thus, the penitent promises
"true amendment" before he receives Absolution.If he allowed a priest
to give him Absolution without firmly purposing to amend, he would not
only invalidate the Absolution, but would commit an additional sin.The promise to amend may, like any other promise, be made and broken;
but the deliberate purpose must be there.No better description of true repentance can be found than in
Tennyson's "Guinevere":--

  _For what is true repentance but in thought--_
  _Not ev'n in inmost thought to think again_
  _The sins that made the past so pleasant to us._


Such has been the teaching of the Catholic Church always, everywhere,
and at all times: such is the teaching of the Church of England, as
part of that Church, and as authoritatively laid down in the Book of
Common Prayer.Absolution is the conveyance of God's
pardon to the penitent sinner by God's ordained Minister, through the
ordained Ministry of Reconciliation.{157}

  Lamb of God, the world's transgression
    Thou alone canst take away;
  Hear!hear our heart's confession,
    And Thy pardoning grace convey.Thine availing intercession
    We but echo when we pray.[2] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[3] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[4] See the First Exhortation in the Order of the Administration of the
Holy Communion.Peter's at Rome was largely built out of funds gained by the
sale of indulgences.[6] The Council of Trent orders that Indulgences must be granted by
Pope and Prelate _gratis_.The second Sacrament of Recovery is _Unction_, or, in more familiar
language, "the Anointing of the Sick".It is called by Origen "the
complement of Penance".The meaning of the Sacrament is found in St.let him call for the elders of the Church; and let them
pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the
prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up;
and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."Here the Bible states that the "Prayer of Faith" with Unction is more
effective than the "Prayer of Faith" without Unction.It can (1) recover the body, and (2) restore the
soul.Its primary {159} object seems to be to recover the body; but it
also, according to the teaching of St.First, he says, Anointing with the Prayer of Faith heals the body; and
then, because of the inseparable union between body and soul, it
cleanses the soul.Thus, as the object of Penance is primarily to heal the soul, and
indirectly to heal the body; so the object of Unction is primarily to
heal the body, and indirectly to heal the soul.The story of Unction may be summarized very shortly.It was instituted
in Apostolic days, when the Apostles "anointed with oil many that were
sick and healed them" (St.It was continued in the Early
Church, and perpetuated during the Middle Ages, when its use (by a
"_corrupt_[1] following of the Apostles") was practically limited to
the preparation of the dying instead of (by a _correct_ "following of
the Apostles") being used for the recovery of the living.In our 1549
Prayer Book an authorized Office was appointed for its use, but this,
lest it should be misused, was omitted in 1552.And although, as
Bishop Forbes says, "everything of that earlier Liturgy was praised by
those who {160} removed it," it has not yet been restored.It is "one
of the lost Pleiads" of our present Prayer Book.But, as Bishop Forbes
adds, "there is nothing to hinder the revival of the Apostolic and
Scriptural Custom of Anointing the Sick whenever any devout person
desires it".[2]



_Extreme Unction._

An unhistoric use of the name partly explains the unhistoric use of the
Sacrament._Extreme_, or last (_extrema_) Unction has been taken to
mean the anointing of the sick when _in extremis_.This, as we have
seen, is a "corrupt," and not a correct, "following of the Apostles".The phrase _Extreme_ Unction means the extreme, or last, of a series of
ritual Unctions, or anointings, once used in the Church.The first
Unction was in Holy Baptism, when the Baptized were anointed with Holy
Oil: then came the anointing in Confirmation: then in Ordination; and,
last of all, the anointing of the sick.Of this last anointing, it is
written: "All Christian men should account, and repute the said manner
of anointing among the other Sacraments, forasmuch as it is a visible
sign of an invisible grace".[3]

{161}

_Its Administration._

It must be administered under the Scriptural conditions laid down in
St.The first condition refers to:--

(1) _The Minister_.--The Minister is _the Church_, in her corporate
capacity.Scripture says to the sick: "Let him call for the Elders,"
or Presbyters, "of the Church".The word is in the plural; it is to be
the united act of the whole Church.And, further, there must be
nothing secret about it, as if it were either a charm, or something to
be ashamed of, or apologized for.It may have to be done in a private
house, but it is to be done by no private person.[4]  "Let him call for
the elders."(2) _The Manner_.--The Elders are to administer Sacrament not in their
own name (any more than the Priest gives Absolution in his own name),
but "in the Name of the Lord".(3) _The Method_.--The sick man is to be anointed (either on the
afflicted part, or in other ways), _with prayer_: "Let them pray over
him".{162}

(4) _The Matter_.--Oil--"anointing him with oil".As in Baptism,
sanctified water is the ordained matter by which "Jesus Christ
cleanseth us from all sin"; so in Unction, consecrated oil is the
ordained matter used by the Holy Ghost to cleanse us from all
sickness--bodily, and (adds St."And if he have
committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."For this latter purpose, there are two Scriptural requirements:
_Confession_ and _Intercession_.For it follows: "Confess your faults
one to another, and pray for one another that ye may be healed".Thus
it is with Unction as with other Sacraments; with the "last" as with
the first--special grace is attached to special means.The Bible says
that, under certain conditions, oil and prayer together will effect
more than either oil or prayer apart; that oil without prayer cannot,
and prayer without oil will not, win the special grace of healing
guaranteed to the use of oil and prayer together.In our days, the use of anointing with prayer is (in alliance with, and
in addition to, Medical Science) being more fully recognized."The
Prayer of Faith" is coming into its own, and is being placed once more
in proper position in the {163} sphere of healing; _anointing_ is being
more and more used "according to the Scriptures".Both are being used
together in a simple belief in revealed truth.It often happens that
"the elders of the Church" are sent for by the sick; a simple service
is used; the sick man is anointed; the united "Prayer of Faith" (it
_must_ be "of Faith") is offered; and, if it be good for his spiritual
health, the sick man is "made whole of whatsoever disease he had".God give us in this, as in every other Sacrament, a braver, quieter,
more loving faith in His promises.The need still exists: the grace is
still to be had._If our love were but more simple,_
    _We should take Him at His word;_
  _And our lives would be all sunshine_
    _In the sweetness of our Lord._

  Word of God, 31.Meanwhile the further Confederate advance under
Bragg, Polk, and Breckinridge was extending all along the line in front of
the Federal camps.The second Federal force to encounter the fury of the
oncoming foe was the division of General W. T. Sherman, which was cut to
pieces and disorganized, but only after it had inflicted frightful loss on
the Confederate army.General Grant, as we have noted, spent the night at Savannah, a town nine
miles by way of the river from Pittsburg Landing.As he sat at breakfast,
he heard the distant boom of cannon and he quickly realized that
Johnston's army had attacked his own at the Landing.Instantly he took a
boat and started for the scene of the conflict.At Crump's Landing, about
half way between the two, General Lew Wallace was stationed with a
division of seven thousand men.As Grant passed Crump's Landing, he met
Wallace and ordered him to be ready for instant marching when he was
called for.When Grant arrived at Pittsburg Landing, about eight o'clock
in the morning, he found a tremendous battle raging, and he spent the day
riding from one division commander to another, giving directions and
cheering them on as best he could.About two and a half miles from the Landing stood a little log church
among the trees, in which for years the simple folk of the countryside had
been wont to gather for worship every Sunday morning.But on this fateful
Sunday, the demon of war reigned supreme.The little church was known as
Shiloh to all the country around, and it gave its name to the great battle
that raged near it on that memorable day.General Prentiss had borne the first onset of the morning.He had been
pressed back half a mile.But about nine o'clock, after being reenforced,
he made a stand on a wooded spot with a dense undergrowth, and here he
held his ground for eight long hours, until five in the afternoon, when he
and a large portion of his division were surrounded and compelled to
surrender.Time after time the Confederates rushed upon his position, but
only to be repulsed with fearful slaughter.This spot came to be known as
the "Hornet's Nest."It was not far from here that the Confederates
suffered the irreparable loss of the day.Their noble commander, Albert
Sidney Johnston, received his death wound as he was urging his troops to
force back Hurlbut's men.He was riding in the center of the fight,
cheering his men, when a minie ball cut an artery of his thigh.But he
thought only of victory and continued in the saddle, raising his voice in
encouragement above the din of battle.Presently his voice became faint, a
deadly pallor blanched his cheek.He was lifted from his horse, but it was
too late.In a few minutes the great commander was dead, from loss of
blood.The death of Johnston, in the belief of many, changed the result at Shiloh
and prevented the utter rout or capture of Grant's army.One of Johnston's
subordinates wrote: "Johnston's death was a tremendous catastrophe.Sometimes the hopes of millions of people depend upon one head and one
arm.The West perished with Albert Sidney Johnston and the Southern
country followed."Jefferson Davis afterward declared that "the fortunes
of a country hung by a single thread on the life that was yielded on the
field of Shiloh."Beauregard succeeded to the command on the fall of Johnston and the
carnage continued all the day--till darkness was falling over the valleys
and the hills.The final charge of the evening was made by three
Confederate brigades close to the Landing, in the hope of gaining that
important point.But by means of a battery of many guns on the bluff of
Dill's Branch, aided by the gunboats in the river, the charge was
repulsed.Beauregard then gave orders to desist from further attack all
along his lines, to suspend operations till morning.When General Bragg
heard this he was furious with rage.He had counted on making an immediate
grand assault in the darkness, believing that he could capture a large
part of the Federal army.When the messenger informed him of Beauregard's order, he inquired if he
had already delivered it to the other commanders."If you had not," rejoined the angry Bragg, "I would not obey it.But Bragg's fears were not shared by his compatriots.Further mention is due the two little wooden gunboats, _Tyler_ and
_Lexington_, for their share in the great fight.The _Tyler_ had lain all
day opposite the mouth of Dill's Branch which flowed through a deep,
marshy ravine, into the Tennessee just above the Landing.Her commander,
Lieutenant Gwin, was eager for a part in the battle, and when he saw the
Confederate right pushing its way toward the Landing, he received
permission to open fire.For an hour his guns increased the difficulties
of Jackson's and Chalmers' brigades as they made their way to the
surrounding of Prentiss.Later on the _Lexington_ joined her sister, and
the two vessels gave valuable support to the Union cannon at the edge of
the ravine and to Hurlbut's troops until the contest ended.All that
night, in the downpour of rain, Lieutenant Gwin, at the request of General
Nelson, sent shot crashing through the trees in the direction where the
Confederates had bivouacked.This completely broke the rest of the
exhausted troops, and had a decided effect upon the next day's result.Southern hopes were high at the close of this first bloody day at Shiloh.Whatever of victory there was at the end of the day belonged to the
Confederates.They had pressed the Federals back more than a mile and now
occupied their ground and tents of the night before.They had captured
General Prentiss with some thousands of his men as a result of his brave
stand at the "Hornet's Nest."But their hopes were mingled with grave fears.General Van Dorn with an
army of twenty thousand men was hastening from Arkansas to join the
Confederate forces at Shiloh; but the roads were bad and he was yet far
away.On the other hand, Buell was coming from Nashville to join Grant's
army.Should he arrive during the night, the contest of the next day would
be unequal and the Confederates would risk losing all that they had
gained.Moreover, Beauregard's army, with its long, muddy march from
Corinth and its more than twelve hours' continuous fighting, was worn and
weary almost to exhaustion.The Union army was stunned and bleeding, but not disabled, at the close of
the first day's battle.Caught unawares, the men had made a noble stand.Though pressed back from their position and obliged to huddle for the
night around the Landing, while thousands of their comrades had fallen on
the gory field, they had hopes of heavy reenforcements during the night.And, indeed, early in the evening the cry ran along the Union lines that
Buell's army had come.The advance guard had arrived late in the afternoon
and had assisted Hurlbut in the closing scene on the bluff of Dill's
ravine; others continued to pour in during the night.And, furthermore,
General Lew Wallace's division, though it had taken a wrong road from
Crump's Landing and had not reached the field in time for the fighting of
the 6th, now at last had arrived.Buell and Wallace had brought with them
twenty-five thousand fresh troops to be hurled on the Confederates on the
morning of the 7th.The preponderance of
numbers now was with the Union army.Everyone knew that the battle was not over, that the issue must be
decided on the coming day, and the weary thousands of both sides sank down
on the ground in a drenching rain to get a little rest and to gain a
little strength for the desperate struggle that was sure to come on the
morrow.Beauregard rested hopes upon a fresh dispatch announcing that Buell was
delayed and the dreaded junction of two Federal armies therefore
impossible.Meanwhile Grant and Buell were together in Sherman's camp and
it was decided that Buell's troops should attack Beauregard next morning.One division of Buell stood to arms all night.At the break of day on Monday, April 7th, all was astir in both camps on
the field of Shiloh, and the dawn was greeted with the roar of cannon.The
troops that Grant now advanced into the contest were all, except about ten
thousand, the fresh recruits that Wallace and Buell had brought, while the
Confederates had not a single company that had not been on the ground the
day before.Some military historians believe that Beauregard would have
won a signal victory if neither army had been reenforced during the night.But now under the changed conditions the Confederates were at a great
disadvantage, and yet they fought for eight long hours with heroic valor.The deafening roar of the cannon that characterized the beginning of the
day's battle was followed by the rattle of musketry, so continuous that no
ear could distinguish one shot from another.Nelson's division of Buell's
army was the first to engage the Confederates.Nelson commanded the
Federal left wing, with Hardee and Breckinridge immediately opposed to
him.The Union center was under the command of Generals McCook and
Crittenden; the right wing was commanded by McClernand, with Hurlbut next,
while Sherman and Lew Wallace occupied the extreme right.The Confederate
left wing was commanded by the doughty Bragg and next to him was General
Polk.Shiloh Church was again the storm center and in it General Beauregard
made his headquarters.Hour after hour the columns in blue and gray surged
to and fro, first one then the other gaining the advantage and presently
losing it.At times the smoke of burning powder enveloped the whole field
and hid both armies from view.The interesting incidents of this day of
blood would fill a volume.General Hindman of the Southern side had a
novel experience.His horse was struck by a bursting shell and torn to a
thousand fragments.The general, thrown ten feet high, fell to the ground,
but leaped to his feet unhurt and asked for another horse.Early in the afternoon, Beauregard became convinced that he was fighting a
losing battle and that it would be the part of prudence to withdraw the
army before losing all.He thereupon sent the members of his staff to the
various corps commanders ordering them to prepare to retreat from the
field, at the same time making a show of resuming the offensive.The
retreat was so skilfully made, the front firing-line being kept intact,
that the Federals did not suspect it for some time.Some hours before
nightfall the fighting had ceased.The Federals remained in possession of
the field and the Confederates were wading through the mud on the road to
Corinth.It was a dreary march for the bleeding and battered Confederate army.An
eye-witness described it in the following language:

"I made a detour from the road on which the army was retreating that I
might travel faster and get ahead of the main body.In this ride of twelve
miles alongside of the routed army, I saw more of human agony and woe than
I trust I will ever again be called upon to witness.The retreating host
wound along a narrow and almost impassable road, extending some seven or
eight miles in length.Here was a line of wagons loaded with wounded,
piled in like bags of grain, groaning and cursing; while the mules plunged
on in mud and water belly-deep, the water sometimes coming into the
wagons.Next came a straggling regiment of infantry, pressing on past the
wagons; then a stretcher borne on the shoulders of four men, carrying a
wounded officer; then soldiers staggering along, with an arm broken and
hanging down, or other fearful wounds, which were enough to destroy life.And, to add to the horrors of the scene, the elements of heaven marshaled
their forces--a fitting accompaniment of the tempest of human desolation
and passion which was raging.A cold, drizzling rain commenced about
nightfall, and soon came harder and faster, then turned to pitiless,
blinding hail.I passed
long wagon trains filled with wounded and dying soldiers, without even a
blanket to shelter them from the driving sleet and hail, which fell in
stones as large as partridge eggs, until it lay on the ground two inches
deep."Some three hundred men died during that awful retreat, and their bodies
were thrown out to make room for others who, although wounded, had
struggled on through the storm, hoping to find shelter, rest, and medical
care."Four days after the battle, however, Beauregard reported to his
government, "this army is more confident of ultimate success than before
its encounter with the enemy."Addressing the soldiers, he said: "You have
done your duty.... Your countrymen are proud of your deeds on the bloody
field of Shiloh; confident in the ultimate result of your valor."The news of these two fearful days at Shiloh was astounding to the
American people.Never before on the continent had there been anything
approaching it.Bull Run was a skirmish in comparison with this gigantic
conflict.The losses on each side exceeded ten thousand men.General Grant
tells us that after the second day he saw an open field so covered with
dead that it would have been possible to walk across it in any direction
stepping on dead bodies, without a foot touching the ground.American
valor was tried to the full on both sides at Shiloh, and the record shows
that it was equal to the test.[Illustration: GENERAL A. S. JOHNSTON, C. S.A brilliant Southern leader, whose early loss was a hard blow to the
Confederacy, Albert Sidney Johnston was a born fighter with a natural
genius for war.A West Pointer of the Class of '26, he had led a strenuous
and adventurous life.In the early Indian wars, in the border conflicts in
Texas, and in the advance into Mexico, he had always proved his worth, his
bravery and his knowledge as a soldier.At the outbreak of the Civil War
he had already been brevetted Brigadier-General, and had been commander of
the military district of Utah.An ardent Southerner, he made his choice,
dictated by heart and conscience, and the Federal authorities knew the
loss they would sustain and the gain that would be given to the cause of
the Confederacy.In '61 he was assigned to a district including Kentucky
and Tennessee with the rank of General.At once he displayed his gifts as
an organizer, but Shiloh cut short a career that would have led him to a
high place in fame and history.The early Confederate successes of the 6th
of April were due to his leadership.His manner of death and his way of
meeting it attested to his bravery.Struck by a minie ball, he kept in the
saddle, falling exhausted and dying from the loss of blood.His death put
the whole South into mourning.[Illustration: CAMP OF THE NINTH MISSISSIPPI.Southern soldiers in shirtsleeves a few months before they fought bravely

To no one who was close to him in the stirring scenes of the early
conflict in the West did Grant pay higher tribute than to this veteran of
the Mexican War who was his Chief of Staff.He was a man to be relied upon
in counsel and in emergency, a fact that the coming leader recognized from
the very outset.An artillery officer and engineer, his military training
and practical experience made him a most valuable executive.He had also
the gift of leading men and inspiring confidence.Always cool and
collected in the face of danger, and gifted with a personality that won
friends everywhere, the reports of all of his superiors show the trust and
confidence that were reposed in him.In April, 1861, he had taken charge
of the fortifications at Cairo, Illinois.He was with Grant at Paducah, at
Forts Henry and Donelson, and at Shiloh where he collected the artillery
near the Landing that repelled the final Confederate attack on April 6th.He remained Chief of Staff until October, 1862.On October 14th, he was
made a Brigadier-General of Volunteers, and was appointed superintendent
of military railroads in the Department of Tennessee.Later he was Chief
of Staff to General Sherman, and again proved his worth when he was with
General Thomas at Hood's defeat before Nashville in December, 1864.On
March 13, 1865, he received the brevet of Major-General of Volunteers.[Illustration: WAITING FOR THE SMELL OF POWDER--CONFEDERATES BEFORE SHILOH

PITTSBURG LANDING--A FEW DAYS AFTER THE BATTLE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]By the name of "Pittsburg Landing," this Tennessee River point,
Southerners designate the conflict of April 6 and 7, 1862.The building
upon the left and one farther up the bank were the only ones standing at
the time of the battle.Of the six steamers, the name of the _Tycoon_,
which brought hospital supplies from the Cincinnati branch of the Sanitary
Commission, is visible.Johnston's plan in the attack on the Federal
forces was to pound away on their left until they were driven away from
the Landing and huddled in the angle between the Tennessee River and Snake
Creek.The onset of the Confederates was full of dash.Sherman was at
length driven from Shiloh Church, and the command of Prentiss was
surrounded and forced to surrender.It looked as if Johnston would crush
the left.Just at this point he was struck down by a minie-ball from the
last line of a Federal force that he had victoriously driven back.The
success of the day now begins to tell on the Confederate army.But the men in gray push vigorously toward the
point where these boats lie anchored.Some heavy guns are massed near this
point.Reenforcements are arriving across the river, but General
Beauregard, who succeeds Johnston in command, suspends the battle till the
morrow.During the night 24,000 fresh troops are taken across the river by
the transports here pictured.They successfully withstand the attempt of
Beauregard, and with the arrival of Lew Wallace from up the river victory
shifts to the Stars and Stripes.THE GUNBOATS AT SHILOH

In the river near Pittsburg Landing, where the Federal transports lay,
were two small gunboats, and what they did during the battle of April 6th
makes a separate chapter in the action.In the early morning they were out
of sight, though within sound of the continuous firing.How the battle was
going, however, was evident.The masses of the blue-clad troops appeared
through the trees on the river bank, showing that under the continuous and
fierce assaults they were falling back upon the Landing.The _Tyler_,
commanded by Lieutenant Gwin, and afterward the _Lexington_, commanded by
Lieutenant Shirk, which arrived at four o'clock, strove to keep the
Confederate army from the Landing.After the surrender of Prentiss,
General Withers set his division in motion to the right toward this point.Chalmers' and Jackson's brigades marched into the ravine of Dill's Branch
and into the range of the Federal gunboats and batteries which silenced
Gage's battery, the only one Withers had, and played havoc with the
Confederate skirmishers.All the rest of the afternoon, until nightfall,
the river sailors kept up their continuous bombardment, and in connection
with the field batteries on the bank checked General Withers' desperate
attempt on the Landing.The dauntless brigade of Chalmers, whose brave
Southerners held their ground near the foot of the ravine and maintained
the conflict after the battle was ended elsewhere, was swept by the
gunboats' fire.When Buell's army, that had been hurrying up to Grant's
assistance, reached the battle-field, Gwin sent a messenger ashore in the
evening to General Nelson, who had just arrived, and asked in what manner
he could now be of service.It was pitch dark; except for the occasional
firing of the pickets the armies were resting after the terrific combat.In reply to Gwin's inquiry, General Nelson requested that the gunboats
keep on firing during the night, and that every ten minutes an 8-inch
shell should be launched in the direction of the Confederate camp.With
great precision Gwin followed out this course.Through the forest the
shells shrieked and exploded over the exhausted Confederates, showering
branches and limbs upon them where they slept, and tearing great gashes in
the earth.The result was that they got little rest, and rest was
necessary.Slowly a certain demoralization became evident--results that
bore fruit in the action that opened on the morrow.Here we see
pictured--in the lower part of the page--the captain's gig and crew near
the _Lexington_, ready to row their commander out into the stream.[Illustration: THE _LEXINGTON_]

[Illustration: FOURTEENTH IOWA VETERANS

AT LIBBY PRISON, RICHMOND, IN 1862, ON THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In the battle of Shiloh the Fourteenth Iowa Infantry formed part of that
self-constituted forlorn hope which made the victory of April 7, 1862,
possible.It held the center at the "Hornet's Nest," fighting the
live-long day against fearful odds.Just as the sun was setting, Colonel
William T. Shaw, seeing that he was surrounded and further resistance
useless, surrendered the regiment.These officers and men were held as
prisoners of war until October 12, 1862, when, moving by Richmond,
Virginia, and Annapolis, Maryland, they went to Benton Barracks, Missouri,
being released on parole, and were declared exchanged on the 19th of
November.This photograph was taken while they were held at Richmond,
opposite the cook-houses of Libby Prison.The third man from the left in
the front row, standing with his hand grasping the lapel of his coat, is
George Marion Smith, a descendant of General Marion of Revolutionary fame.It is through the courtesy of his son, N. H. Smith, that this photograph
appears here.The Fourteenth Iowa Infantry was organized at Davenport and
mustered in November 6, 1861.At Shiloh the men were already veterans of
Forts Henry and Donelson.Those who were not captured fought in the battle
of Corinth, and after the prisoners were exchanged they took part in the
Red River expedition and several minor engagements.They were mustered out
November 16, 1864, when the veterans and recruits were consolidated in two
companies and assigned to duty in Springfield, Illinois, till August,
1865.These two companies were mustered out on August 8th.The regiment
lost during service five officers and fifty-nine enlisted men killed and
mortally wounded, and one officer and 138 enlisted men by disease.Iowa
sent nine regiments of cavalry, four batteries of light artillery and
fifty-one regiments of infantry to the Union armies, a grand total of
76,242 soldiers.[Illustration: THE MOUNTED POLICE OF THE WEST.]Stalwart horsemen such as these bore the brunt of keeping order in the
turbulent regions fought over by the armies in the West.The bugle call,
"Boots and Saddles!"might summon them to fight, or to watch the movements
of the active Confederates, Van Dorn and Price.It was largely due to
their daring and bravery that the Confederate forces were held back from
the Mississippi so as not to embarrass the movements of Grant and the
gunboats.Of this unattached cavalry of the Army of the Ohio were the men
in the upper picture--Company D, Fourth Kentucky Volunteers, enlisted at
Louisville, December, 1861.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE FOURTH KENTUCKY CAVALRY.][Illustration: THE FLEET THAT CLEARED THE RIVER

COPYRIGHT, 1911."A spear-thrust in the back" was delivered to the Confederacy by the
inland-river fleet that cut it in two.The squadron of Flag-Officer Davis
is here lying near Memphis.Thus appeared the Federal gunboats on June 5,
1862, two miles above the city.Fort Pillow had been abandoned the
previous day, but the Confederate river-defense flotilla still remained
below and the Federals, still smarting from the disaster inflicted on the
"Cincinnati," were determined to bring on a decisive engagement and, if
possible, clear the river of their antagonists.Meanwhile four new vessels
had joined the Federal squadron.These were river steamers which Charles
Ellet, Jr., had converted into rams in the short space of six weeks.Their
principle was as old as history, but it was now to be tried for the first
time in aid of the Federal cause.On these heights above the river the
inhabitants of Memphis were crowded on the morning of June 6, 1862, as the
Federal squadron moved down-stream against the Confederate gunboats that
were drawn up in double line of battle opposite the city.Everyone wanted
to see the outcome of the great fight that was impending, for if its
result proved adverse to the Confederates, Memphis would fall into Federal
hands and another stretch of the Mississippi would be lost to the South.In the engagement at Memphis two of the Ellet rams accompanied the
squadron--the "Queen of the West" commanded by Charles Ellet, and the
"Monarch" commanded by his younger brother, Major Alfred Ellet.The
Confederate flotilla was destroyed, but with the loss of Charles Ellet,
from a mortal wound.[Illustration: MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE ON THE HEIGHTS]

[Illustration: A LOCOMOTIVE THAT HANGED EIGHT MEN AS SPIES

COPYRIGHT, 1911.In April, 1862, J. J. Andrews, a citizen of Kentucky and a spy in General
Buell's employment, proposed seizing a locomotive on the Western and
Atlantic Railroad at some point below Chattanooga and running it back to
that place, cutting telegraph wires and burning bridges on the way.General O. M. Mitchel authorized the plan and twenty-two men volunteered
to carry it out.On the morning of April 12th, the train they were on
stopped at Big Shanty station for breakfast.The bridge-burners (who were
in citizens' clothes) detached the locomotive and three box-cars and
started at full speed for Chattanooga, but after a run of about a hundred
miles their fuel was exhausted and their pursuers were in sight.Andrews was condemned as a spy and hanged at Atlanta,
July 7th.The others were confined at Chattanooga, Knoxville, and
afterward at Atlanta, where seven were executed as spies.Of the fourteen
survivors, eight escaped from prison; and of these, six eventually reached
the Union lines.Six were removed to Richmond and confined in Castle
Thunder until they were exchanged in 1863.The Confederates attempted to
destroy the locomotive when they evacuated Atlanta.[Illustration: BATTLE BETWEEN THE MONITOR AND MERRIMAC._Painted by E. Packbauer._

[Illustration: THE BIGGEST GUN OF ALL--THE 20-INCH MONSTER FOR WHICH NO
TARGET WOULD SERVE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.A photograph of the only 20-inch gun made during the war.On March 30, 1861, a 15-inch Columbiad was heralded in
_Harper's Weekly_ as the biggest gun in the world, but three years later
this was exceeded.In 1844 Lieutenant (later Brigadier-General) Thomas
Jefferson Rodman of the Ordnance Department commenced a series of tests to
find a way to obviate the injurious strains set up in the metal, by
cooling a large casting from the exterior.He finally developed his theory
of casting a gun with the core hollow and then cooling it by a stream of
water or cold air through it.So successful was this method that the War
Department, in 1860, authorized a 15-inch smooth-bore gun.General Rodman then projected his 20-inch smooth-bore gun,
which was made in 1864 under his direction at Fort Pitt, Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania.It was mounted at Fort Hamilton, New York Harbor, very soon
afterwards, but on account of the tremendous size and destructive effect
of its projectiles it was fired only four times during the war.It was
almost impossible to get a target that would withstand the shots and leave
anything to show what had happened.These four shots were fired with 50,
75, 100 and 125 pounds of powder.The projectile weighed 1,080 pounds, and
the maximum pressure on the bore was 25,000 pounds.In March, 1867, it was
again fired four times with 125, 150, 175 and 200 pounds of powder, each
time with an elevation of twenty-five degrees, the projectile attaining a
maximum range of 8,001 yards.This is no mean record even compared with
twentieth century pieces.NEWS OF MARCH 30, 1861

    Gun at Fort Monroe, Virginia; and also a picture, from a recent

    test it.It is proper that we should say that the small drawing is
    from the lithograph which is published in MAJOR BARNARD'S "Notes on
    Sea-Coast Defense," published by Mr.D. Van Nostrand, of this city.This gun was cast at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by Knapp, Rudd, &, Co.,

[Illustration: THE "CHEESE BOX" THAT MADE HISTORY AS IT APPEARED FOUR
MONTHS LATER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In this remarkable view of the "Monitor's" turret, taken in July, 1862, is
seen as clearly as on the day after the great battle the effect of the
Confederate fire upon Ericsson's novel craft.As the two vessels
approached each other about half-past eight on that immortal Sunday
morning, the men within the turret waited anxiously for the first shot of
their antagonist.It soon came from her bow gun and went wide of the mark.The "Virginia" no longer had the broadside of a wooden ship at which to
aim.Not until the "Monitor" was alongside the big ironclad at close range
came the order "Begin firing" to the men in the "cheese box."Then the
gun-ports of the turret were triced back, and it began to revolve for the
first time in battle.As soon as the guns were brought to bear, two
11-inch solid shot struck the "Virginia's" armor; almost immediately she
replied with her broadside, and Lieutenant Greene and his gunners listened
anxiously to the shells bursting against their citadel.They made no more
impression than is apparent in the picture.Confident in the protection of
their armor, the Federals reloaded with a will and came again and again to
close quarters with their adversary, hurling two great projectiles about
every eight minutes.[Illustration: MEN ON THE "MONITOR" WHO FOUGHT WITH WORDEN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here on the deck of the "Monitor" sit some of the men who held up the
hands of Lieutenant Worden in the great fight with the "Virginia."In the
picture, taken in July, 1862, only four months afterward, one of the nine
famous dents on the turret are visible.It required courage not only to
fight in the "Monitor" for the first time but to embark on her at all, for
she was a strange and untried invention at which many high authorities
shook their heads.But during the battle, amid all the difficulties of
breakdowns by the new untried machinery, Lieutenant S. Dana Greene coolly
directed his men, who kept up a fire of remarkable accuracy.Twenty of the
forty-one 11-inch shot fired from the "Monitor" took effect, more or less,
on the iron plates of the "Virginia."The "Monitor" was struck nine times
on her turret, twice on the pilot-house, thrice on the deck, and eight
times on the side.While Greene was fighting nobly in the turret, Worden
with the helmsman in the pilot-house was bravely maneuvering his vessel
and seeking to ram his huge antagonist.Twice he almost succeeded and both
times Greene's guns were used on the "Virginia" at point-blank range with
telling effect.Toward the close of the action Worden was blinded by a
shell striking near one of the peep-holes in the pilot-house and the
command devolved upon Greene.Worden, even in his agony of pain while the
doctor was attending his injuries, asked constantly about the progress of
the battle; and when told that the "Minnesota" was safe, he said, "Then I
can die happy."[Illustration: ADMIRAL J. L. WORDEN]


DAVID GLASGOW FARRAGUT THE MAN WHO DARED AT NEW ORLEANS AND MOBILE BAY

[Illustration]

"ANY MAN WHO IS PREPARED FOR DEFEAT WOULD BE HALF DEFEATED BEFORE HE
COMMENCED"

THE COMMANDER OF THE FEDERAL FLEET AT NEW ORLEANS

"Who is this Farragut?"So the younger generation of Americans must have
wondered, at the news of late January, 1862.Farragut was to have a flag
in the Gulf and was expected to capture New Orleans.Thus far in the War,
he had done nothing but sit on an obscure retiring board in the Navy
Department at Washington.But Commander David D. Porter knew him, for it
was with Porter's own father in the famous old "Essex" that Farragut as a
mere boy had proved worthy to command a fighting ship.And now it was
Porter who had recommended him for a task considered gravely dangerous by
all, foolhardy by not a few.This was no less than to pass the forts below
New Orleans, defeat a powerful and determined Confederate flotilla,
capture the city, and then sweep up the Mississippi and split the
Confederacy in two.To this Farragut rigidly held himself and the brave
men under him, when, in the dark hour before dawn of April 24, 1862, they
faced the terrible bombardment of the forts and fought their way through
the flames of fire rafts desperately maneuvered by the opposing gunboats.Next day New Orleans was Farragut's.Leaving it to the co-operating army
under General B. F. Butler, Farragut pushed on up the river, passed and
repassed the fortifications at Vicksburg, but the army needed to drive
home the wedge thus firmly entered by the navy was not yet ready.It was
another year before the sturdy blows of Farragut were effectually
supplemented ashore.[Illustration: THE MEN WHO DARED--SAILORS ON THE "HARTFORD" AFTER PASSING
THE NEW ORLEANS FORTS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On this page of unwritten history McPherson and Oliver, the New Orleans
war-time photographers, have caught the crew of the staunch old "Hartford"
as they relaxed after their fiery test.In unconscious picturesqueness
grouped about the spar-deck, the men are gossiping or telling over again
their versions of the great deeds done aboard the flagship.Some have
seized the opportunity for a little plain sewing, while all are interested
in the new and unfamiliar process of "having their pictures taken."The
notable thing about the picture is the number of young faces.Only a few
of the old salts whose bearded and weather-beaten faces give evidence of
service in the old navy still remain.After the great triumph in Mobile
Bay, Farragut said of these men: "I have never seen a crew come up like
ours.They are ahead of the old set in small arms, and fully equal to them
at the great guns.They arrived here a mere lot of boys and young men, and
have now fattened up and knocked the nine-inch guns about like twenty-four
pounders, to the astonishment of everybody.There was but one man who
showed fear and he was allowed to resign.This was the most desperate
battle I ever fought since the days of the old 'Essex.'""It was the
anxious night of my life," wrote Farragut later.The spar-deck shown below
recalls another speech."Don't flinch from that fire, boys!There is a
hotter fire for those who don't do their duty!"So shouted Farragut with
his ship fast aground and a huge fire-raft held hard against her wooden
side by the little Confederate tug "Mosher."The ship seemed all ablaze
and the men, "breathing fire," were driven from their guns.Farragut,
calmly pacing the poop deck, called out his orders, caring nothing for the
rain of shot from Fort St.The men, inspired by such coolness,
leaped to their stations again and soon a shot pierced the boiler of the
plucky "Mosher" and sank her.[Illustration: SPAR-DECK OF THE "HARTFORD"]




THE FIGHT FOR RICHMOND


A shattered and discomfited army were the hosts of McDowell when they
reached the banks of the Potomac, after that ill-fated July Sunday at Bull
Run.Dispirited by the sting of defeat, this motley and unorganized mass
of men became rather a mob than an army.The transformation of this chaos
of demoralization into the trained, disciplined, and splendid troops of
the Grand Army of the Potomac, was a triumph of the "young Napoleon"--Gen.Fresh from his victories in the mountains of
West Virginia, he was called to Washington to transmute 200,000 American
citizens, fresh from shop and farm, into soldiers.For months it was "drill, drill."Public opinion grew restless at the cry
"All's Quiet Along the Potomac."At last, on March 17th, McClellan moved.On April 5th the Union army was advancing toward Richmond up the
Peninsula, but was stopped at Yorktown by the Confederate General
Magruder.Not until May 3rd were McClellan's siege guns in place.At Williamsburg the lines in Gray
stood again."Jeb" Stuart, D. H. Hill, and Jubal Early fought nobly.They
gained their object--more time for their retreating comrades.But
McClellan's fighting leaders, Hooker, Kearny and Hancock, were not to be
denied.With Yorktown and Williamsburg inscribed upon its victorious banners, the
Army of the Potomac took up again its toilsome march from Cumberland
Landing toward the Confederate capital on the James.It was the 16th of May, 1862, when the advanced corps reached White House,
the ancestral home of the Lees.On every side were fields of wheat, and,
were it not for the presence of one hundred thousand men, there was the
promise of a full harvest.It was here that General McClellan took up his
headquarters, a distance of twenty-four miles from Richmond.In the Confederate capital a panic had seized the people.As the
retreating army of Johnston sought the environs of Richmond and news of
the invading hosts was brought in, fear took possession of the inhabitants
and many wild rumors were afloat as to the probable capture of the city.But it was not a fear that Johnston would not fight.The strategic policy
of the Southern general had been to delay the advance of the Northern
army.Fortunately for him, the rainy weather proved a powerful ally.The
time had now come when he should change his position from the defensive to
the offensive.The Army of Northern Virginia had been brought to bay, and
it now turned to beat off the invaders and save its capital.On the historic Peninsula lay two of the greatest and most splendid armies
that had ever confronted each other on the field of battle.The
engagement, now imminent, was to be the first in that series of contests,
between the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia, ending
three years thereafter, at Appomattox, when the war-worn veterans of gray
should lay down their arms, in honor, to the war-worn veterans of blue.The Union advance was retarded by the condition of the weather and the
roads.Between McClellan's position at White House and the waiting
Confederate army lay the Chickahominy, an erratic and sluggish stream,
that spreads itself out in wooded swamps and flows around many islands,
forming a valley from half a mile to a mile wide, bordered by low bluffs.In dry weather it is but a mere brook, but a moderate shower will cause it
to rise quickly and to offer formidable opposition to any army seeking its
passage.The valley is covered with trees whose tops reach to the level
of the adjacent highlands, thus forming a screen from either side.The
bridges crossing it had all been destroyed by the retreating army except
the one at Mechanicsville, and it was not an easy task that awaited the
forces of McClellan as they made their way across the spongy soil.The van of the Union army reached the Chickahominy on May 20th.The bridge
was gone but the men under General Naglee forded the little river,
reaching the plateau beyond, and made a bold reconnaissance before the
Confederate lines.In the meantime, newly constructed bridges were
beginning to span the Chickahominy, and the Federal army soon was crossing
to the south bank of the river.General McClellan had been promised reenforcements from the north.General
McDowell with forty thousand men had started from Fredericksburg to join
him north of the Chickahominy.For this reason, General McClellan had
thrown the right wing of his army on the north of the river while his left
would rest on the south side of the stream.This position of his army did
not escape the eagle eye of the Confederate general, Joseph E. Johnston,
who believed the time had now come to give battle, and perhaps destroy the
small portion of the Union forces south of the river.Meanwhile, General "Stonewall" Jackson, in the Shenandoah, was making
threatening movements in the direction of Washington, and McDowell's
orders to unite with McClellan were recalled.The roads in and about Richmond radiate from that city like the spokes of
a wheel.One of these is the Williamsburg stage-road, crossing the
Chickahominy at Bottom's Bridge, only eleven miles from Richmond.It was
along this road that the Federal corps of Keyes and Heintzelman had made
their way.Their orders were "to go prepared for battle at a moment's
notice" and "to bear in mind that the Army of the Potomac has never been
checked."Parallel to this road, and about a mile to the northward, runs the
Richmond and York River Railroad.Seven miles from Richmond another
highway intersects the one from Williamsburg, known as the Nine Mile road.At the point of this intersection once grew a clump of seven pines, hence
the name of "Seven Pines," often given to the battle fought on this spot.A thousand yards beyond the pines were two farmhouses in a grove of oaks.Where the Nine Mile road crossed the railroad was
Fair Oaks Station.Southeast of Seven Pines was White Oak Swamp.Casey's division of Keyes'
corps was stationed at Fair Oaks Farm.A fifth of a mile in front lay his
picket line, extending crescent shape, from the swamp to the Chickahominy.Couch's division of the same corps was at Seven Pines, with his right wing
extending along the Nine Mile road to Fair Oaks Station.Heintzelman's
corps lay to the rear; Kearney's division guarded the railroad at Savage's
Station and Hooker's the approaches to the White Oak Swamp.It was a well-wooded region and at this time was
in many places no more than a bog.No sooner had these positions been
taken, than trees were cut to form abatis, rifle-pits were hastily dug,
and redoubts for placing artillery were constructed.The picket line lay
along a dense growth of woods.Through an opening in the trees, the
Confederate army could be seen in force on the other side of the clearing.The plans of the Confederate general were well matured.On Friday, May
30th, he gave orders that his army should be ready to move at daybreak.That night the "windows of heaven seemed to have been opened" and the
"fountains of the deep broken up."It was
the most violent storm that had swept over that region for a generation.The thunderbolts rolled without
cessation.The earth was
thoroughly drenched.From mud-soaked beds
the soldiers arose the next morning to battle.Owing to the storm the Confederates did not move so early as intended.However, some of the troops were in readiness by eight o'clock.Hour after
hour the forces of Longstreet and Hill awaited the sound of the signal-gun
that would tell them General Huger was in his position to march.It was near noon before General Hill, weary of waiting,
advanced to the front, preceded by a line of skirmishers, along the
Williamsburg road.The Union pickets were lying at the edge of the forest.The soldiers in the pits had been under arms for several hours awaiting
the attack.Suddenly there burst through the woods the soldiers of the
South.A shower of bullets fell beneath the trees and the Union pickets
gave way.On and on came the lines of gray in close columns.In front of
the abatis had been planted a battery of four guns.General Naglee with
four regiments, the Fifty-sixth and One hundredth New York and Eleventh
Maine and One hundred and fourth Pennsylvania, had gone forward, and in
the open field met the attacking army.Naglee's men charged with their bayonets and pressed the gray lines back
again to the edge of the woods.Here they were met by a furious fire of
musketry and quickly gave way, seeking the cover of the rifle-pits at Fair
Oaks Farm.In this position, for nearly three
hours the Federals waged an unequal combat against three times their
number.Then, suddenly a galling fire plowed in on them from the left.It
came from Rains' brigade, which had executed a flank movement.At the same
time the brigade of Rodes rushed toward them.The Federals saw the
hopelessness of the situation.The officers at the batteries tried to
spike their guns but were killed in the attempt.Hastily falling back,
five guns were left to be turned on them in their retreat.In another minute they would have been entirely surrounded
and captured.The next stand would be made at
Seven Pines, where Couch was stationed.The forces here had been weakened
by sending relief to Casey.The situation of the Federals was growing
critical.At the same time General Longstreet sent reenforcements to
General Hill.Couch was forced out of his position toward the right in the
direction of Fair Oaks Station and was thus separated from the main body
of the army, then in action.The Confederates pushed strongly against the Federal center.Heintzelman
came to the rescue.For an hour and a
half the lines of blue and gray surged back and forth.The Federals were
gradually giving way.The left wing, alone, next to the White Oak Swamp,
was holding its own.At the same time over at Fair Oaks Station whither Couch had been forced,
were new developments.He was about to strike the Confederate army on its
left flank, but just when the guns were being trained, there burst across
the road the troops of General G. W. Smith, who up to this time had been
inactive.These men were fresh for the fight, superior in number, and soon
overpowered the Northerners.It looked for a time as if the whole Union
army south of the Chickahominy was doomed.Over at Seven Pines the center of McClellan's army was about to be routed.Now it was that General Heintzelman personally collected about eighteen
hundred men, the fragments of the broken regiments, and took a decided
stand at the edge of the timber.But
this alone would not nor did not save the day.To the right of this new
line of battle, there was a rise of ground.From here the woods abruptly
sloped to the rear.If this elevation were once secured by the
Confederates, all would be lost and rout would be inevitable.The quick
eye of General Keyes took in the situation.He was stationed on the left;
to reach the hill would necessitate taking his men between the
battle-lines.Calling on a
single regiment to follow he made a dash for the position.The Southern
troops, divining his intention, poured a deadly volley into his ranks and
likewise attempted to reach this key to the situation.The Federals gained
the spot just in time.The new line was formed as a heavy mass of
Confederates came upon them.The tremendous Union fire was too much for
the assaulting columns, which were checked.They had forced the Federal
troops back from their entrenchments a distance of two miles, but they
never got farther than these woods.The river fog now came up as the
evening fell and the Southern troops spent the night in the captured
camps, sleeping on their arms.The Federals fell back toward the river to
an entrenched camp.Meanwhile at Fair Oaks Station the day was saved, too, in the nick of
time, for the Federals.On the north side of the Chickahominy were
stationed the two divisions of Sedgwick and Richardson, under command of
General Sumner.Scarcely had the battle opened when McClellan at his
headquarters, six miles away, heard the roar and rattle of artillery.He
was sick at the time, but he ordered General Sumner to be in readiness.At
this time there were four bridges across the river--two of them were
Bottom's Bridge and the railroad bridge.To go by either of these would
consume too much time in case of an emergency.General Sumner had himself
constructed two more bridges, lying between the others.The heavy flood of
the preceding night, which was still rising, had swept one of these
partially away.In order to save time, he put his men under arms and
marched them to the end of the upper bridge and there waited throughout
the greater part of the afternoon for orders to cross.Before them rolled
a muddy and swollen stream, above whose flood was built a rude and
unstable structure.From the other side could be distinctly heard the
roar of battle.The fate of the day and of the Army of the Potomac rested
upon these men at the end of the bridge.The possibility of crossing was doubted by everyone, including the general
himself.The bridge had been built of logs, held together and kept from
drifting by the stumps of trees.Over the river proper it was suspended by
ropes attached to trees, felled across the stream.At last the long-expected order to advance came.The men stepped upon the
floating bridge.It swayed to and fro as the solid column passed over it.Beneath the men was the angry flood which would engulf all if the bridge
should fall.Gradually the weight pressed it down between the solid stumps
and it was made secure till the army had crossed.Had the passage been
delayed another hour the flood would have rendered it impassable.Guided by the roar of battle the troops hurried on.The artillery was left
behind in the mud of the Chickahominy.The steady, rolling fire of
musketry and the boom of cannon told of deadly work in front.It was
nearly six o'clock before Sedgwick's column deployed into line in the rear
of Fair Oaks Station.Just now there was a lull in
the battle.The Confederates were gathering themselves for a vigorous
assault on their opponents' flaming front.General Joseph E. Johnston himself had immediate command.President
Jefferson Davis had come out from his capital to witness the contest.A heavy fusillade poured from
their batteries and muskets.Great rents were made in the line of blue.The openings were quickly filled and a scorching fire was
sent into the approaching columns.Again and again the charge was repeated
only to be repulsed.Then came the order to fix bayonets.Five
regiments--Thirty-fourth and Eighty-second New York, Fifteenth and
Twentieth Massachusetts and Seventh Michigan--pushed to the front.Into
the woods where the Confederates had fallen back the charge was made.Driving the Southern lines back in confusion, these dashing columns saved
the day for the Army of the Potomac.Night was now settling over the wooded field.Here and there flashes of
light could be seen among the oaks, indicating a diligent search for the
wounded.General Johnston ordered his troops to sleep on the field.A few
minutes later he was struck by a rifle-ball and almost immediately a shell
hit him, throwing him from his horse, and he was borne off the field.The
first day of the battle was over.The disability of the Southern commander made it possible for the
promotion of a new leader upon whom the fortunes of the Army of Northern
Virginia would soon rest.This was General Robert E. Lee; although the
immediate command for the next day's contest fell upon General G. W.
Smith.Early Sunday morning the battle was again in progress.The command
of Smith, near Fair Oaks Station, advanced down the railroad, attacking
Richardson, whose lines were north of it and were using the embankment as
a fortification.Longstreet's men were south of the railroad.The firing
was heavy all along this line, the opposing forces being not more than
fifty yards from each other.For an hour and a half the musketry fire was
intensely heavy.The line of gray could
not withstand the galling fire and for the first time that day fell back.But the Union line had been broken, too.Both sides
were gathering themselves for another onslaught.It was then that there
were heard loud shouts from the east of the railroad.There, coming through the woods, was a large body of Federal troops.They formed a magnificent body of soldiers and
seemed eager for the fray.Turning in on the Williamsburg road they
rapidly deployed to the right and the left.In front of them was an open
field, with a thick wood on the other side.The Confederates had posted
themselves in this forest and were waiting for their antagonists.The
Federals marched upon the field in double-quick time; their movements
became a run, and they began firing as they dashed forward.They were met
by a withering fire of field artillery and a wide gap being opened in
their ranks.They reached the edge of the woods and
as they entered its leafy shadows the tide of battle rolled in with them.The front line was lost to view in the forest, except for an occasional
gleam of arms from among the trees.The din and the clash and roar of
battle were heard for miles.It was almost
a hand-to-hand combat in the heavy forest and tangled slashings.The sound
of battle gradually subsided, then ceased except for the intermittent
reports of small arms, and the second day's fight was over.The Federal troops could
now occupy without molestation the positions they held the previous
morning.The forest paths were strewn with the dead and the dying.Many of
the wounded were compelled to lie under the scorching sun for hours before
help reached them.Every farmhouse became an improvised hospital where the
suffering soldiers lay.Many were placed upon cars and taken across the
Chickahominy.The dead soldiers, blue and
gray, found sometimes lying within a few feet of each other, were buried
on the field of battle.The two giants had met in their first great combat
and were even now beginning to gird up their loins for a desperate
struggle before the capital of the Confederacy.[Illustration: "LITTLE MAC" PREPARING FOR THE CAMPAIGN--A ROYAL AIDE

General McClellan was engaged in transforming the raw recruits in the
camps near the national capital into the finished soldiers of the Army of
the Potomac."Little Mac," as they called him, was at this time at the
height of his popularity.He appears in the center between two of his

RAMPARTS THAT BAFFLED McCLELLAN.(Hasty fortifications of the Confederates
at Yorktown.)It was against such fortifications as these, which Magruder
had hastily reenforced with sand-bags, that McClellan spent a month
preparing his heavy batteries.Magruder had far too few soldiers to man
his long line of defenses properly, and his position could have been taken
by a single determined attack.This rampart was occupied by the
Confederate general, D. H. Hill, who had been the first to enter Yorktown
in order to prepare it for siege.He was the last to leave it on the night
of May 3, 1862.[Illustration]

WRECKED ORDNANCE.(Gun exploded by the Confederates on General Hill's
rampart, Yorktown.)Although the Confederates abandoned 200 pieces of
ordnance at Yorktown, they were able to render most of them useless before
leaving.Hill succeeded in terrorizing the Federals with grape-shot, and
some of this was left behind.After the evacuation the ramparts were
overrun by Union trophy seekers.The soldier resting his hands upon his
musket is one of the Zouaves whose bright and novel uniforms were so
conspicuous early in the war.This spot was directly on the line of the

ordnance fell into the hands of the Confederates early in the war, through
the ill-advised and hasty abandonment of Norfolk Navy Yard by the
Federals.Many of these guns did service at Yorktown and subsequently on
the James River against the Union.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.THE CONFEDERATE COMMAND OF THE RIVER.Looking north up the river, four of the five 8-inch Columbiads composing

Confederates, the guns being spiked.The vessels in the river are
transport ships, with the exception of the frigate just off shore.[Illustration: THE GOAL--THE CONFEDERATE CAPITOL]

TWO KEEPERS OF THE GOAL

The North expected General McClellan to possess himself of this citadel of
the Confederacy in June, 1862, and it seemed likely the expectation would
be realized.In the upper picture we get a near view of the State House at
Richmond, part of which was occupied as a Capitol by the Confederate
Congress during the war.In this building were stored the records and
archives of the Confederate Government, many of which were lost during the
hasty retreat of President Davis and his cabinet at the evacuation of
Richmond, April, 1865.Below, we see the city of Richmond from afar, with
the Capitol standing out boldly on the hill.McClellan was not destined to
reach this coveted goal, and it would not have meant the fall of the
Confederacy had he then done so.When Lincoln entered the building in
1865, the Confederacy had been beaten as much by the blockade as by the
operations of Grant and Sherman with vastly superior forces.[Illustration: THE SPIRES OF RICHMOND

Hill did most of the fierce fighting which drove back the Federals on the
first day, and only the timely arrival of Sumner's troops enabled the
Federals to hold their ground.Had they failed they would have been driven
into the morasses of the Chickahominy, retreat across which would have
been difficult as the bridges were partly submerged by the swollen stream.After General Johnston was wounded, General G. W. Smith was in command
during the second day's fighting.[Illustration: GENERAL G. W. SMITH, C. S.[Illustration: GENERAL D. H. HILL, C. S.[Illustration: THE ADVANCE THAT BECAME A RETREAT]

Here, almost within sight of the goal (Richmond), we see McClellan's
soldiers preparing the way for the passage of the army and its supplies.The soil along the Chickahominy was so marshy that in order to move the
supply trains and artillery from the base at White House and across the
river to the army, corduroy approaches to the bridges had to be built.It
was well that the men got this early practice in road-building.Thanks to
the work kept up, McClellan was able to unite the divided wings of the
army almost at will.[Illustration: "REGULARS" NEAR FAIR OAKS--OFFICERS OF McCLELLAN'S HORSE

Confederate batteries will open upon him, and for the next few moments
shells and bullets from the shrapnels will be bursting and whistling about
his ears.Then he will pass out of the danger-zone to an altitude beyond
the reach of the Confederate artillery.After the evacuation of Yorktown,
May 4, 1862, Professor Lowe, who had been making daily observations from
his balloon, followed McClellan's divisions, which was to meet Longstreet
next day at Williamsburg.On reaching the fortifications of the abandoned
city, Lowe directed the men who were towing the still inflated balloon in
which he was riding to scale the corner of the fort nearest to his old
camp, where the last gun had been fired the night before.This fort had
devoted a great deal of effort to attempting to damage the too inquisitive
balloon, and a short time previously one of the best Confederate guns had
burst, owing to over-charging and too great an elevation to reach the high
altitude.The balloonist had witnessed the explosion and a number of
gunners had been killed and wounded within his sight.His present visit
was in order to touch and examine the pieces and bid farewell to what he
then looked upon as a departed friend.This is indicated as the same gun
on page 371.[Illustration: THE PHOTOGRAPH THE BALLOONIST RECOGNIZED FORTY-EIGHT YEARS

vital point of the battle."A close examination of this photograph will
reveal Professor Lowe's hand resting on the network of the balloon,
although his body is not in the photograph.It truly is remarkable that
Professor Lowe should have seen and recognized, nearly half a century
afterward, this photograph taken at one of the most critical moments of
his life.[Illustration: THE SLAUGHTER FIELD AT FAIR OAKS.]Over this ground the fiercest fighting of the two days' battle took place,
on May 31, 1862.Some 400 soldiers were buried here, where they fell, and
their hastily dug graves appear plainly in the picture.In the redoubt
seen just beyond the two houses was the center of the Federal line of
battle, equi-distant, about a mile and a half, from both Seven Pines and
Fair Oaks.The entrenchments near these farm dwellings were begun on May
28th by Casey's Division, 4th Corps.There was not time to finish them
before the Confederate attack opened the battle, and the artillery of
Casey's Division was hurriedly placed in position behind the incomplete
works.[Illustration: THE UNFINISHED REDOUBT.]In the smaller picture we see the inside of the redoubt at the left

hurriedly brought up.In the background General Sickles' Brigade appears
drawn up in line of battle.When the Confederates first advanced Casey's
artillery did telling work, handsomely repelling the attack early in the
afternoon of May 31st.Later in the day Confederate sharpshooters from
vantage points in neighboring trees began to pick off the officers and the
gunners and the redoubt had to be relinquished.The abandoned guns were
turned against the retreating Federals.[Illustration: THE "REDHOT BATTERY."COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.On the afternoon of May 31st, at Fair Oaks, the Confederates were driving

their own for the rest of the day.The guns grew so hot from constant
firing that it was only with the greatest care that they could be swabbed
and loaded.These earthworks were thrown up for McCarthy's Battery,
Company C, 1st Pennsylvania Artillery, near Savage's Station.The soldiers
nicknamed it the "Redhot Battery."[Illustration: AIMING THE GUNS AT FAIR OAKS.COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Here we see the beginning of the lull in the fighting of the second day at
Fair Oaks, which it has been asserted led to a fatal delay and the ruin of
McClellan's Peninsula Campaign.The first day's battle at Fair Oaks, May
31, 1862, was decidedly a Federal reverse which would have developed into
a rout had not Sumner, crossing his troops on the perilous Grapevine
Bridge, come up in time to rally the retreating men.Here we see some of
them within the entrenchments at Fair Oaks Station on the Richmond & York
River Railroad.The order will soon come to cease firing at the end of the
second day's fighting, the result of which was to drive the Confederates
back to Richmond.The heavy rainstorm on the
night of May 30th had made the movement of artillery extremely difficult,
and McClellan wanted to complete the bridges and build entrenchments
before advancing.This delay gave the Confederates time to reorganize
their forces and place them under the new commander, Robert E. Lee, who
while McClellan lay inactive effected a junction with "Stonewall" Jackson.Then during the Seven Days' Battles Lee steadily drove McClellan from his
position, within four or five miles of Richmond, to a new position on the
James River.From this secure and advantageous water base McClellan
planned a new line of advance upon the Confederate Capital.In the smaller
picture we see the interior of the works at Fair Oaks Station, which were
named Fort Sumner in honor of the General who brought up his Second Corps
and saved the day.The camp of the Second Corps is seen beyond the

THE CANNONEERS WHO KEPT UP WITH THE CAVALRY--IN THIS SWIFTEST BRANCH OF
THE SERVICE EACH MAN RIDES HORSEBACK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Here are drawn up Harry Benson's Battery A, of the Second United States
Artillery, and Horatio Gates Gibson's Batteries C and G, combined of the
Third United States Artillery, near Fair Oaks, Virginia.They arrived
there just too late to take part in the battle of June, 1862.By "horse
artillery," or "flying artillery" as it is sometimes called, is meant an
organization equipped usually with 10-pounder rifled guns, with all hands
mounted.In ordinary light artillery the cannoneers either ride on the
gun-carriage or go afoot.In "flying artillery" each cannoneer has a
horse.This form is by far the most mobile of all, and is best suited to
accompany cavalry on account of its ability to travel rapidly.With the
exception of the method of mounting the cannoneers, there was not any
difference between the classes of field batteries except as they were
divided between "light" and "heavy."In the photograph above no one is
riding on the gun-carriages, but all have separate mounts.Battery A of
the Second United States Artillery was in Washington in January, 1861, and
took part in the expedition for the relief of Fort Pickens, Florida.It
went to the Peninsula, fought at Mechanicsville May 23-24, 1862, and took
part in the Seven Days' battles before Richmond June 25th to July 1st.Batteries C and G of the Third United States Artillery were at San
Francisco, California, till October 1861, when they came East, and also
went to the Peninsula and served at Yorktown and in the Seven Days.THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY

    Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible, and when
    you strike and overcome him, never let up in the pursuit so long as
    your men have strength to follow.... The other rule is, never fight
    against heavy odds, if by any possible maneuvering you can hurl your
    own force on only a part, and that the weakest part, of your enemy and
    crush it.Such tactics will win every time, and a small army may thus
    destroy a large one in detail.--_"Stonewall" Jackson._


The main move of the Union army, for 1862, was to be McClellan's advance
up the Peninsula toward Richmond.Everything had been most carefully
planned by the brilliant strategist.With the assistance of McDowell's
corps, he expected in all confidence to be in the Confederate capital
before the spring had closed.But, comprehensively as he had worked the
scheme out, he had neglected a factor in the problem which was destined in
the end to bring the whole campaign to naught.This was the presence of
"Stonewall" Jackson in the Valley of Virginia.The strategic value to the Confederacy of this broad, sheltered avenue
into Maryland and Pennsylvania was great.Along the northeasterly roads
the gray legions could march in perfect safety upon the rear of Washington
so long as the eastern gaps could be held.No wonder that the Federal
authorities, however much concerned with other problems of the war, never
removed a vigilant eye from the Valley.Jackson had taken possession of Winchester, near the foot of the Valley,
in November, 1861.The Confederate
army dwindled greatly during the winter.At the beginning of March there
were but forty-five hundred men.With Banks and his forty thousand now on
Virginia soil at the foot of the Valley, and Fremont's army approaching
the head, why should the Federal commander even think about this
insignificant fragment of his foe?But the records of war have shown that
a small force, guided by a master mind, sometimes accomplishes more in
effective results than ten times the number under a less active and able
commander.The presence of Banks compelled Jackson to withdraw to Woodstock, fifty
miles south of Winchester.If McClellan ever experienced any anxiety as to
affairs in the Valley, it seems to have left him now, for he ordered Banks
to Manassas on March 16th to cover Washington, leaving General Shields and
his division of seven thousand men to hold the Valley.When Jackson heard
of the withdrawal, he resolved that, cut off as he was from taking part in
the defense of Richmond, he would do what he could to prevent any
aggrandizement of McClellan's forces.Shields hastened to his station at Winchester, and Jackson, on the 23d of
March, massed his troops at Kernstown, about three miles south of the
former place.Deceived as to the strength of his adversary, he led his
weary men to an attack on Shields' right flank about three o'clock in the
afternoon.He carried the ridge where the Federals were posted, but the
energy of his troops was spent, and they had to give way to the reserves
of the Union army after three hours of stubborn contest.The Federal ranks
were diminished by six hundred; the Confederate force by more than seven
hundred.Kernstown was a Union victory; yet never in history did victory
bring such ultimate disaster upon the victors.At Washington the alarm was intense over Jackson's audacious attack.Williams' division of Banks' troops was halted on its way to Manassas and
sent back to Winchester.Lincoln transferred Blenker's division, nine
thousand strong, to Fremont.These things were done at once, but they were
by no means the most momentous consequence of Kernstown.The President
began to fear that Jackson's goal was Washington.After consulting six of
his generals he became convinced that McClellan had not arranged proper
protection for the city.Therefore, McDowell and his corps of thirty-seven
thousand men were ordered to remain at Manassas.The Valley grew to
greater importance in the Federal eyes.Banks was made entirely
independent of McClellan and the defense of this region became his sole
task.McClellan, to his great chagrin, saw his force depleted by forty-six
thousand men.There were now four Union generals in the East operating
independently one of the other.General Ewell with eight thousand troops on the upper Rappahannock and
General Johnson with two brigades were now ordered to cooperate with
Jackson.Schenck and Milroy, of
Fremont's corps, began to threaten Johnson.Banks, with twenty thousand,
was near Harrisonburg.The Confederate leader left General Ewell to watch Banks while he made a
dash for Milroy and Schenck.He fought them at McDowell on May 8th and
they fled precipitately to rejoin Fremont.The swift-acting Jackson now
darted at Banks, who had fortified himself at Strasburg.Jackson stopped
long enough to be joined by Ewell.He did not attack Strasburg, but stole
across the Massanutten Mountain unknown to Banks, and made for Front
Royal, where a strong Union detachment was stationed under Colonel Kenly.Early on the afternoon of May 23d, Ewell rushed from the forest.Kenly and
his men fled before them toward Winchester.A large number were captured
by the cavalry before they had gotten more than four miles away.Banks at Strasburg realized that Jackson was approaching from the rear,
the thing he had least expected and had made no provision for.There was nothing to be done but
retreat to Winchester.Even that was prevented by the remarkable speed of
Jackson's men, who could march as much as thirty-five miles a day.On May
24th, the Confederates overtook and struck the receding Union flank near
Newtown, inflicting heavy loss and taking many prisoners.Altogether,
three thousand of Banks' men fell into Jackson's hands.This exploit was most opportune for the Southern arms.It caused the final
ruin of McClellan's hopes.Banks received one more attack from Ewell's
division the next day as he passed through Winchester on his way to the
shelter of the Potomac.He crossed at Williamsport late the same evening
and wrote the President that his losses, though serious enough, might have
been far worse "considering the very great disparity of forces engaged,
and the long-matured plans of the enemy, which aimed at nothing less than
entire capture of our force."Lincoln now rescinded his resolution to
send McDowell to McClellan.Instead, he transferred twenty thousand of the
former's men to Fremont and informed McClellan that he was not, after all,
to have the aid of McDowell's forty thousand men.Fremont was coming from the west; Shields lay in the other direction, but
Jackson was not the man to be trapped.He managed to hold Fremont while he
marched his main force quickly up the Valley.At Port Republic he drove
Carroll's brigade of Shields' division away and took possession of a
bridge which Colonel Carroll had neglected to burn.Fremont in pursuit was
defeated by Ewell at Cross Keys.Jackson immediately put his force of
twelve thousand over the Shenandoah at Port Republic and burned the
bridge.Safe from the immediate attack by Fremont, he fell upon Tyler and
Carroll, who had not more than three thousand men between them.The
Federals made a brave stand, but after many hours' fighting were compelled
to retreat.Jackson emerged through Swift Run Gap on the 17th of June, to
assist in turning the Union right on the Peninsula, and Banks and Shields,
baffled and checkmated at every move, finally withdrew from the Valley.[Illustration: "STONEWALL" JACKSON AT WINCHESTER 1862

here upon the features of Thomas Jonathan Jackson precisely as that
brilliant Lieutenant-General of the Confederate States Army appeared
during his masterly "Valley Campaign" of 1862.Few photographers dared to
approach this man, whose silence and modesty were as deep as his mastery
of warfare.Indeed, his plans were rarely
known even to his immediate subordinates, and herein lay the secret of
those swift and deadly surprises that raised him to first rank among the
world's military figures.Jackson's ability and efficiency won the utter
confidence of his ragged troops; and their marvelous forced marches, their
contempt for privations if under his guidance, put into his hands a living
weapon such as no other leader in the mighty conflict had ever wielded.[Illustration: NANCY HART THE CONFEDERATE GUIDE AND SPY

and spy work for the Confederate leaders as were their men-folk.Famous
among these fearless girls who knew every inch of the regions in which
they lived was Nancy Hart.So valuable was her work as a guide, so
cleverly and often had she led Jackson's cavalry upon the Federal outposts
in West Virginia, that the Northern Government offered a large reward for
her capture.Lieutenant-Colonel Starr of the Ninth West Virginia finally
caught her at Summerville in July, 1862.While in a temporary prison, she
faced the camera for the first time in her life, displaying more alarm in
front of the innocent contrivance than if it had been a body of Federal
soldiery.She posed for an itinerant photographer, and her captors placed
the hat decorated with a military feather upon her head.Nancy managed to
get hold of her guard's musket, shot him dead, and escaped on Colonel
Starr's horse to the nearest Confederate detachment.A few days later,
July 25th, she led two hundred troopers under Major Bailey to Summerville.They reached the town at four in the morning, completely surprising two
companies of the Ninth West Virginia.They fired three houses, captured
Colonel Starr, Lieutenant Stivers and other officers, and a large number
of the men, and disappeared immediately over the Sutton road.[Illustration: THE GERMAN DIVISION SENT AGAINST JACKSON

Springfield rifles from his own stores.When the combined forces met
Jackson and Ewell at Cross Keys, five of Blenker's regiments were sent
forward to the first attack.In the picture Brigadier-General Louis

THE SEVEN DAYS' BATTLES

    McClellan's one hope, one purpose, was to march his army out of the
    swamps and escape from the ceaseless Confederate assaults to a point
    on James River where the resistless fire of the gunboats might protect
    his men from further attack and give them a chance to rest.To that
    end, he retreated night and day, standing at bay now and then as the
    hunted stag does, and fighting desperately for the poor privilege of
    running away.And the splendid fighting of his men was a tribute to the skill and
    genius with which he had created an effective army out of what he had
    described as "regiments cowering upon the banks of the Potomac, some
    perfectly raw, others dispirited by recent defeat, others going home."Out of a demoralized and disorganized mass reenforced by utterly
    untrained civilians, McClellan had within a few months created an army
    capable of stubbornly contesting every inch of ground even while
    effecting a retreat the very thought of which might well have
    disorganized an army.--_George Cary Eggleston, in "The History of the
    Confederate War."_


General Lee was determined that the operations in front of Richmond should
not degenerate into a siege, and that the Army of Northern Virginia should
no longer be on the defensive.To this end, early in the summer of 1862,
he proceeded to increase his fighting force so as to make it more nearly
equal in number to that of his antagonist.Every man who could be spared
from other sections of the South was called to Richmond.Numerous
earthworks soon made their appearance along the roads and in the fields
about the Confederate capital, giving the city the appearance of a
fortified camp.The new commander in an address to the troops said that
the army had made its last retreat.Meanwhile, with the spires of Richmond in view, the Army of the Potomac
was acclimating itself to a Virginia summer.The whole face of the country
for weeks had been a veritable bog.Now that the sweltering heat of June
was coming on, the malarious swamps were fountains of disease.The
polluted waters of the sluggish streams soon began to tell on the health
of the men.Malaria and typhoid were prevalent; the hospitals were
crowded, and the death rate was appalling.Such conditions were not inspiring to either general or army.McClellan
was still hoping for substantial reenforcements.McDowell, with his forty
thousand men, had been promised him, but he was doomed to disappointment
from that source.Yet in the existing state of affairs he dared not be
inactive.South of the Chickahominy, the army was almost secure from
surprise, owing to well-protected rifle-pits flanked by marshy thickets or
covered with felled trees.But the Federal forces were still divided by
the fickle stream, and this was a constant source of anxiety to the
commander.He proceeded to transfer all of his men to the Richmond side of
the river, excepting the corps of Franklin and Fitz John Porter.About the
middle of June, General McCall with a force of eleven thousand men joined
the Federal army north of the Chickahominy, bringing the entire fighting
strength to about one hundred and five thousand.So long as there remained
the slightest hope of additional soldiers, it was impossible to withdraw
all of the army from the York side of the Peninsula, and it remained
divided.That was a brilliant initial stroke of the Confederate general when he
sent his famous cavalry leader, J. E. B. Stuart, with about twelve hundred
Virginia troopers, to encircle the army of McClellan.Veiling his
intentions with the utmost secrecy, Stuart started June 12, 1862, in the
direction of Fredericksburg as if to reenforce "Stonewall" Jackson.The
first night he bivouacked in the pine woods of Hanover.No fires were
kindled, and when the morning dawned, his men swung upon their mounts
without the customary bugle-call of "Boots and Saddles."Turning to the
east, he surprised and captured a Federal picket; swinging around a corner
of the road, he suddenly came upon a squadron of Union cavalry.The
Confederate yell rent the air and a swift, bold charge by the Southern
troopers swept the foe on.They had not traveled far when they came again to a force drawn up in
columns of fours, ready to dispute the passage of the road.This time the
Federals were about to make the charge.A squadron of the Confederates
moved forward to meet them.Some Union skirmishers in their effort to get
to the main body of their troops swept into the advancing Confederates and
carried the front ranks of the squadron with them.These isolated
Confederates found themselves in an extremely perilous position, being
gradually forced into the Federal main body.Before they could extricate
themselves, nearly every one in the unfortunate front rank was shot or cut
down.The Southern cavalrymen swept on and presently found themselves nearing
the York River Railroad--McClellan's supply line.As they approached
Tunstall's Station they charged down upon it, with their characteristic
yell, completely surprising a company of Federal infantry stationed there.Telegraph wires were cut and a tree felled
across the track to obstruct the road.This had hardly been done before
the shriek of a locomotive was heard.A train bearing Union troops came
thundering along, approaching the station.The engineer, taking in the
situation at a glance, put on a full head of steam and made a rush for the
obstruction, which was easily brushed aside.As the train went through a
cut the Confederates fired upon it, wounding and killing some of the
Federal soldiers in the cars.Riding all through a moonlit night, the raiders reached Sycamore Ford of
the Chickahominy at break of day.As usual this erratic stream was
overflowing its banks.They started to ford it, but finding that it would
be a long and wearisome task, a bridge was hastily improvised at another
place where the passage was made with more celerity.Now, on the south
bank of the river, haste was made for the confines of Richmond, where, at
dawn of the following day, the troopers dropped from their saddles, a
weary but happy body of cavalry.Lee thus obtained exact and detailed information of the position of
McClellan's army, and he laid out his campaign accordingly.Meanwhile his
own forces in and about Richmond were steadily increasing.He was planning
for an army of nearly one hundred thousand and he now demonstrated his
ability as a strategist.Word had been despatched to Jackson in the
Shenandoah to bring his troops to fall upon the right wing of McClellan's
army.At the same time Lee sent General Whiting north to make a feint of
joining Jackson and moving upon Washington.The authorities at Washington were frightened, and McClellan
received no more reenforcements.Jackson now began a hide-and-seek game
among the mountains, and managed to have rumors spread of his army being
in several places at the same time, while skilfully veiling his actual
movements.It was not until the 25th of June that McClellan had definite knowledge of
Jackson's whereabouts.He was then located at Ashland, north of the
Chickahominy, within striking distance of the Army of the Potomac.McClellan was surprised but he was not unprepared.Seven days before he
had arranged for a new base of supplies on the James, which would now
prove useful if he were driven south of the Chickahominy.On the very day he heard of Jackson's arrival at Ashland, McClellan was
pushing his men forward to begin his siege of Richmond--that variety of
warfare which his engineering soul loved so well.His advance guard was
within four miles of the Confederate capital.His strong fortifications
were bristling upon every vantage point, and his fond hope was that within
a few days, at most, his efficient artillery, for which the Army of the
Potomac was famous, would be belching forth its sheets of fire and lead
into the beleagured city.In front of the Union encampment, near Fair
Oaks, was a thick entanglement of scrubby pines, vines, and ragged bushes,
full of ponds and marshes.This strip of woodland was less than five
hundred yards wide.Beyond it was an open field half a mile in width.The
Union soldiers pressed through the thicket to see what was on the other
side and met the Confederate pickets among the trees.Upon emerging into the open, the Federal troops found it
filled with rifle-pits, earthworks, and redoubts.At once they were met
with a steady and incessant fire, which continued from eight in the
morning until five in the afternoon.At times the contest almost reached
the magnitude of a battle, and in the end the Union forces occupied the
former position of their antagonists.This passage of arms, sometimes
called the affair of Oak Grove or the Second Battle of Fair Oaks, was the
prelude to the Seven Days' Battles.The following day, June 26th, had been set by General "Stonewall" Jackson
as the date on which he would join Lee, and together they would fall upon
the right wing of the Army of the Potomac.The Federals north of the
Chickahominy were under the direct command of General Fitz John Porter.Defensive preparations had been made on an extensive scale.Field works,
heavily armed with artillery, and rifle-pits, well manned, covered the
roads and open fields and were often concealed by timber from the eye of
the opposing army.The extreme right of the Union line lay near
Mechanicsville on the upper Chickahominy.A tributary of this stream from
the north was Beaver Dam Creek, upon whose left bank was a steep bluff,
commanding the valley to the west.This naturally strong position, now
well defended, was almost impregnable to an attack from the front.Before sunrise of the appointed day the Confederate forces were at the
Chickahominy bridges, awaiting the arrival of Jackson.To reach these some
of the regiments had marched the greater part of the night.Noon passed and
Jackson had not arrived.At three o'clock, General A. P. Hill, growing
impatient, decided to put his troops in motion.Crossing at Meadow Bridge,
he marched his men along the north side of the Chickahominy, and at
Mechanicsville was joined by the commands of Longstreet and D. H. Hill.Driving the Union outposts to cover, the Confederates swept across the low
approach to Beaver Dam Creek.A murderous fire from the batteries on the
cliff poured into their ranks.Gallantly the attacking columns withstood
the deluge of leaden hail and drew near the creek.A few of the more
aggressive reached the opposite bank but their repulse was severe.Later in the afternoon relief was sent to Hill, who again attempted to
force the Union position at Ellerson's Mill, where the <DW72> of the west
bank came close to the borders of the little stream.From across the open
fields, in full view of the defenders of the cliff, the Confederates moved
down the <DW72>.They were in range of the Federal batteries, but the fire
was reserved.Every artilleryman was at his post ready to fire at the
word; the soldiers were in the rifle-pits sighting along the glittering
barrels of their muskets with fingers on the triggers.As the approaching
columns reached the stream they turned with the road that ran parallel to
the bank.From every waiting field-piece the shells came screaming through the air.Volley after volley of musketry was poured into the flanks of the marching
Southerners.The hillside was soon covered with the victims of the gallant
charge.Twilight fell upon the warring troops and there were no signs of a
cessation of the unequal combat.Night fell, and still from the heights
the lurid flames burst in a display of glorious pyrotechnics.It was nine
o'clock when Hill finally drew back his shattered regiments, to await the
coming of the morning.The Forty-fourth Georgia regiment suffered most in
the fight; three hundred and thirty-five being the dreadful toll, in dead
and wounded, paid for its efforts to break down the Union position.Dropping back to the rear this ill-fated regiment attempted to re-form its
broken ranks, but its officers were all among those who had fallen.Both
armies now prepared for another day and a renewal of the conflict.The action at Beaver Dam Creek convinced McClellan that Jackson was really
approaching with a large force, and he decided to begin his change of base
from the Pamunkey to the James, leaving Porter and the Fifth Corps still
on the left bank of the Chickahominy, to prevent Jackson's fresh troops
from interrupting this great movement.It was, indeed, a gigantic
undertaking, for it involved marching an army of a hundred thousand men,
including cavalry and artillery, across the marshy peninsula.A train of
five thousand heavily loaded wagons and many siege-guns had to be
transported; nearly three thousand cattle on the hoof had to be driven.From White House the supplies could be shipped by the York River Railroad
as far as Savage's Station.Thence to the James, a distance of seventeen
miles, they had to be carried overland along a road intersected by many
others from which a watchful opponent might easily attack.General Casey's
troops, guarding the supplies at White House, were transferred by way of
the York and the James to Harrison's Landing on the latter river.The
transports were loaded with all the material they could carry.The rest
was burned, or put in cars.These cars, with locomotives attached, were
then run into the river.On the night of June 26th, McCall's Federal division, at Beaver Dam Creek,
was directed to fall back to the bridges across the Chickahominy near
Gaines' Mill and there make a stand, for the purpose of holding the
Confederate army.During the night the wagon trains and heavy guns were
quietly moved across the river.Just before daylight the operation of
removing the troops began.The Confederates were equally alert, for about
the same time they opened a heavy fire on the retreating columns.This
march of five miles was a continuous skirmish; but the Union forces, ably
and skilfully handled, succeeded in reaching their new position on the
Chickahominy heights.The morning of the new day was becoming hot and sultry as the men of the
Fifth Corps made ready for action in their new position.The selection of
this ground had been well made; it occupied a series of heights fronted on
the west by a sickle-shaped stream.The battle-lines followed the course
of this creek, in the arc of a circle curving outward in the direction of
the approaching army.The land beyond the creek was an open country,
through which Powhite Creek meandered sluggishly, and beyond this a wood
densely tangled with undergrowth.Around the Union position were also many
patches of wooded land affording cover for the troops and screening the
reserves from view.Porter had learned from deserters and others that Jackson's forces, united
to those of Longstreet and the two Hills, were advancing with grim
determination to annihilate the Army of the Potomac.He had less than
eighteen thousand men to oppose the fifty thousand Confederates.To
protect the Federals, trees had been felled along a small portion of their
front, out of which barriers protected with rails and knapsacks were
erected.Porter had considerable artillery, but only a small part of it
could be used.It was two o'clock, on June 27th, when General A. P. Hill
swung his division into line for the attack.He was unsupported by the
other divisions, which had not yet arrived, but his columns moved rapidly
toward the Union front.The assault was terrific, but twenty-six guns
threw a hail-storm of lead into his ranks.Under the cover of this
magnificent execution of artillery, the infantry sent messages of death to
the approaching lines of gray.The Confederate front recoiled from the incessant outpour of grape,
canister, and shell.The heavy cloud of battle smoke rose lazily through
the air, twisting itself among the trees and settling over the forest like
a pall.The tremendous momentum of the repulse threw the Confederates into
great confusion.Men were separated from their companies and for a time it
seemed as if a rout were imminent.The Federals, pushing out from under
the protection of their great guns, now became the assailants.The
Southerners were being driven back.Others threw themselves on the ground to escape the withering fire, while
some tenaciously held their places.General
Slocum arrived with his division of Franklin's corps, and his arrival
increased the ardor of the victorious Federals.It was then that Lee ordered a general attack upon the entire Union front.Reenforcements were brought to take the place of the shattered regiments.The engagement began with a sharp artillery fire from the Confederate
guns.Then the troops moved forward, once more to assault the Union
position.In the face of a heavy fire they rushed across the sedgy
lowland, pressed up the hillside at fearful sacrifice and pushed against
the Union front.It was a death grapple for the mastery of the field.General Lee, sitting on his horse on an eminence where he could observe
the progress of the battle, saw, coming down the road, General Hood, of
Jackson's corps, who was bringing his brigade into the fight.Riding
forward to meet him, Lee directed that he should try to break the line.Hood, disposing his men for the attack, sent them forward, but, reserving
the Fourth Texas for his immediate command, he marched it into an open
field, halted, and addressed it, giving instructions that no man should
fire until ordered and that all should keep together in line.The forward march was sounded, and the intrepid Hood, leading his men,
started for the Union breastworks eight hundred yards away.They moved at
a rapid pace across the open, under a continually increasing shower of
shot and shell.At every step the ranks grew thinner and thinner.As they
reached the crest of a small ridge, one hundred and fifty yards from the
Union line, the batteries in front and on the flank sent a storm of shell
and canister plowing into their already depleted files.They quickened
their pace as they passed down the <DW72> and across the creek.Not a shot
had they fired and amid the sulphurous atmosphere of battle, with the wing
of death hovering over all, they fixed bayonets and dashed up the hill
into the Federal line.With a shout they plunged through the felled timber
and over the breastworks.The Union line had been pierced and was giving
way.It was falling back toward the Chickahominy bridges, and the retreat
was threatening to develop into a general rout.The twilight was closing
in and the day was all but lost to the Army of the Potomac.Now a great
shout was heard from the direction of the bridge and, pushing through the
stragglers at the river bank were seen the brigades of French and Meagher,
detached from Sumner's corps, coming to the rescue.General Meagher, in
his shirt sleeves, was leading his men up the bluff and confronted the
Confederate battle line.This put a stop to the pursuit and as night was
at hand the Southern soldiers withdrew.The battle of Gaines' Mill, or the
Chickahominy, was over.When Lee came to the banks of the little river the next morning he found
his opponent had crossed over and destroyed the bridges.The Army of the
Potomac was once more united.During the day the Federal wagon trains were
safely passed over White Oak Swamp and then moved on toward the James
River.Lee did not at first divine McClellan's intention.He still
believed that the Federal general would retreat down the Peninsula, and
hesitated therefore to cross the Chickahominy and give up the command of
the lower bridges.But now on the 29th the signs of the movement to the
James were unmistakable.Early on that morning Longstreet and A. P. Hill
were ordered to recross the Chickahominy by the New Bridge and Huger and
Magruder were sent in hot pursuit of the Federal forces.It was the brave
Sumner who covered the march of the retreating army, and as he stood in
the open field near Savage's Station he looked out over the plain and saw
with satisfaction the last of the ambulances and wagons making their way
toward the new haven on the James.In the morning of that same day he had already held at bay the forces of
Magruder at Allen's Farm.On his way from Fair Oaks, which he left at
daylight, he had halted his men at what is known as the "Peach Orchard,"
and from nine o'clock till eleven had resisted a spirited fire of musketry
and artillery.And now as the grim warrior, on this Sunday afternoon in
June, turned his eyes toward the Chickahominy he saw a great cloud of dust
rising on the horizon.It was raised by the troops of General Magruder who
was pressing close behind the Army of the Potomac.The Southern field-guns
were placed in position.A contrivance, consisting of a heavy gun mounted
on a railroad car and called the "Land Merrimac," was pushed into position
and opened fire upon the Union forces.The battle began with a fine play
of artillery.For an hour not a musket was fired.The army of blue
remained motionless.Then the mass of gray moved across the field and from
the Union guns the long tongues of flame darted into the ranks before
them.The charge was met with vigor and soon the battle raged over the
entire field.Both sides stood their ground till darkness again closed the
contest, and nearly eight hundred brave men had fallen in this Sabbath
evening's battle.Before midnight Sumner had withdrawn his men and was
following after the wagon trains.The Confederates were pursuing McClellan's army in two columns, Jackson
closely following Sumner, while Longstreet was trying to cut off the Union
forces by a flank movement.On the last day of June, at high noon, Jackson
reached the White Oak Swamp.He attempted to ford
the passage, but the Union troops were there to prevent it.While Jackson
was trying to force his way across the stream, there came to him the sound
of a desperate battle being fought not more than two miles away, but he
was powerless to give aid.Longstreet and A. P. Hill had come upon the Federal regiments at Glendale,
near the intersection of the Charles City road, guarding the right flank
of the retreat.It was Longstreet who, about half-past two, made one of
his characteristic onslaughts on that part of the Union army led by
General McCall.Each brigade seemed to act on its own behalf.They hammered
here, there, and everywhere.Repulsed at one place they charged at
another.The Eleventh Alabama, rushing out from behind a dense wood,
charged across the open field in the face of the Union batteries.The men
had to run a distance of six hundred yards.A heavy and destructive fire
poured into their lines, but on they came, trailing their guns.The
batteries let loose grape and canister, while volley after volley of
musketry sent its death-dealing messages among the Southerners.But
nothing except death itself could check their impetuous charge.When two
hundred yards away they raised the Confederate yell and rushed for
Randol's battery.Pausing for an instant they deliver a volley and attempt to seize the
guns.Bayonets are crossed and men engage in a hand-to-hand struggle.The
contending masses rush together, asking and giving no quarter and
struggling like so many tigers.Darkness is closing on the fearful scene,
yet the fighting continues with unabated ferocity.There are the shouts of
command, the clash and the fury of the battle, the sulphurous smoke, the
flashes of fire streaking through the air, the yells of defiance, the
thrust, the parry, the thud of the clubbed musket, the hiss of the bullet,
the spouting blood, the death-cry, and beneath all lie the bodies of
America's sons, some in blue and some in gray.While Lee and his army were held in check by the events of June 30th at
White Oak Swamp and the other battle at Glendale or Nelson's Farm, the
last of the wagon trains had arrived safely at Malvern Hill.The contest
had hardly closed and the smoke had scarcely lifted from the blood-soaked
field, when the Union forces were again in motion toward the James.By
noon on July 1st the last division reached the position where McClellan
decided to turn again upon his assailants.He had not long to wait, for
the Confederate columns, led by Longstreet, were close on his trail, and a
march of a few miles brought them to the Union outposts.They found the
Army of the Potomac admirably situated to give defensive battle.Malvern
Hill, a plateau, a mile and a half long and half as broad, with its top
almost bare of woods, commanded a view of the country over which the
Confederate army must approach.Along the western face of this plateau
there are deep ravines falling abruptly in the direction of the James
River; on the north and east is a gentle <DW72> to the plain beneath,
bordered by a thick forest.Around the summit of the hill, General
McClellan had placed tier after tier of batteries, arranged like an
amphitheater.Surmounting these on the crest were massed seven of his
heaviest siege-guns.His army surrounded this hill, its left flank being
protected by the gunboats on the river.The morning and early afternoon were occupied with many Confederate
attacks, sometimes formidable in their nature, but Lee planned for no
general move until he could bring up a force that he considered sufficient
to attack the strong Federal position.The Confederate orders were to
advance when the signal, a yell, cheer, or shout from the men of
Armistead's brigade, was given.Late in the afternoon General D. H. Hill heard some shouting, followed by
a roar of musketry.No other general seems to have heard it, for Hill made
his attack alone.It was gallantly done, but no army could have withstood
the galling fire of the batteries of the Army of the Potomac as they were
massed upon Malvern Hill.All during the evening, brigade after brigade
tried to force the Union lines.The gunners stood coolly and manfully by
their batteries.The Confederates were not able to make concerted efforts,
but the battle waxed hot nevertheless.They were forced to breast one of
the most devastating storms of lead and canister to which an assaulting
army has ever been subjected.The round shot and grape cut through the
branches of the trees and the battle-field was soon in a cloud of smoke.Column after column of Southern soldiers rushed up to the death-dealing
cannon, only to be mowed down.The thinned and ragged lines, with a valor
born of desperation, rallied again and again to the charge, but to no
avail.The batteries on the heights still hurled their missiles of death.The field below was covered with the dead and wounded of the Southland.The gunboats in the river made the battle scene more awe-inspiring with
their thunderous cannonading.Their heavy shells shrieked through the
forest, and great limbs were torn from the trees as they hurtled by in
their outburst of fury.The combatants were no longer distinguishable except by
the sheets of flame.It was nine o'clock before the guns ceased their
fire, and only an occasional shot rang out over the bloody field of
Malvern Hill.The courageous though defeated Confederate, looking up the next day
through the drenching rain to where had stood the embrasured wall with its
grim batteries and lines of blue, that spoke death to so many of his
companions-in-arms, saw only deserted ramparts.The Union army had
retreated in the darkness of the night.But this time no foe harassed its
march.Unmolested, it sought its new camp at Harrison's Landing, where it
remained until August 3d, when, as President Lincoln had been convinced of
the impracticability of operating from the James River as a base, orders
were issued by General Halleck for the withdrawal of the Army of the
Potomac from the Peninsula.The net military result of the Seven Days was a disappointment to the
South.Although thankful that the siege of Richmond had been raised, the
Southern public believed that McClellan should not have been allowed to
reach the James River with his army intact."That army," Eggleston states, "splendidly organized, superbly equipped,
and strengthened rather than weakened in morale, lay securely at rest on
the James River, within easy striking distance of Richmond.There was no
knowing at what moment McClellan might hurl it again upon Richmond or upon
that commanding key to Richmond--the Petersburg position.In the hands of
a capable commander McClellan's army would at this time have been a more
serious menace than ever to the Confederate capital, for it now had an
absolutely secure and unassailable base of operations, while its fighting
quality had been improved rather than impaired by its seven days of
battling."General Lee's own official comment on the military problem involved and
the difficulties encountered was: "Under ordinary circumstances the
Federal army should have been destroyed.Its escape was due to the causes
already stated.Prominent among these is the want of correct and timely
information.This fact, attributable chiefly to the character of the
country, enabled General McClellan skilfully to conceal his retreat and to
add much to the obstructions with which nature had beset the way of our
pursuing columns; but regret that more was not accomplished gives way to
gratitude to the Sovereign Ruler of the Universe for the results
achieved."Whatever the outcome of the Seven Days' Battle another year was to
demonstrate beyond question that the wounding of General Johnston at Fair
Oaks had left the Confederate army with an even abler commander.On such a
field as Chancellorsville was to be shown the brilliancy of Lee as leader,
and his skilful maneuvers leading to the invasion of the North.And the
succeeding volume will tell, on the other hand, how strong and compact a
fighting force had been forged from the raw militia and volunteers of the
North.[Illustration: McDOWELL AND McCLELLAN--TWO UNION LEADERS WHOSE PLANS
"STONEWALL" JACKSON FOILED

COPYRIGHT BY REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In General McClellan's plan for the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, General
McDowell, with the First Army Corps of 37,000 men, was assigned a most
important part, that of joining him before Richmond.Lincoln had
reluctantly consented to the plan, fearing sufficient protection was not
provided for Washington.By the battle of Kernstown, March 23d, in the
Valley of Virginia, Jackson, though defeated, so alarmed the
Administration that McDowell was ordered to remain at Manassas to protect
the capital.The reverse at Kernstown was therefore a real triumph for
Jackson, but with his small force he had to keep up the game of holding
McDowell, Banks, and Fremont from reenforcing McClellan.If he failed,
80,000 troops might move up to Richmond from the west while McClellan was
approaching from the North.But Jackson, on May 23d and 25th, surprised
Banks' forces at Front Royal and Winchester, forcing a retreat to the
Potomac.At the news of this event McDowell was ordered not to join
McClellan in front of Richmond.[Illustration: JOHNSTON AND LEE--A PHOTOGRAPH OF 1869._Copyright by Review of Reviews Co._]

These men look enough alike to be brothers.They were so in arms, at West
Point, in Mexico and throughout the war.General Joseph E. Johnston (on
the left), who had led the Confederate forces since Bull Run, was wounded
at Fair Oaks.That wound gave Robert E. Lee (on the right) his opportunity
to act as leader.After Fair Oaks, Johnston retired from the command of
the army defending Richmond.The new commander immediately grasped the
possibilities of the situation which confronted him.The promptness and
completeness with which he blighted McClellan's high hopes of reaching
Richmond showed at one stroke that the Confederacy had found its great
general.It was only through much sifting that the North at last picked
military leaders that could rival him in the field.[Illustration: THE FLEET THAT FED THE ARMY]

White House Landing came the steam and sailing vessels laden with supplies
for McClellan's second attempt to reach Richmond.Tons of ammunition and
thousands of rations were sent forward from here to the army on the
Chickahominy in June, 1862.A short month was enough to cause McClellan to
again change his plans, and the army base was moved to the James River.The Richmond and York Railroad was lit up by burning cars along its course
to the Chickahominy.Little was left to the Confederates save the charred
ruins of the White House itself.[Illustration: ELLERSON'S MILL--WHERE HILL ASSAULTED.]Not until after nightfall of June 26, 1862, did the Confederates of
General A. P. Hill's division cease their assaults upon this position
where General McCall's men were strongly entrenched.Time after time the
Confederates charged over the ground we see here at Ellerson's Mill, near
Mechanicsville.Till 9 o'clock at night they continued to pour volleys at
the position, and then at last withdrew.The victory was of little use to
the Federals, for Jackson on the morrow, having executed one of the
flanking night marches at which he was an adept, fell upon the Federal
rear at Gaines' Mill.[Illustration: THE WASTE OF WAR

COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Railroad trains loaded with tons of food and ammunition were run
deliberately at full speed off the embankment shown in the left
foreground.They plunged headlong into the waters of the Pamunkey.This
was the readiest means that McClellan could devise for keeping his immense
quantity of stores out of the hands of the Confederates in his hasty
change of base from White House to the James after Gaines' Mill.This was
the bridge of the Richmond and York River Railroad, and was destroyed June
28, 1862, to render the railroad useless to the Confederates.[Illustration: THE BRIDGE THAT STOOD]

The force under General McCall was stationed by McClellan on June 19,
1862, to observe the Meadow and Mechanicsville bridges over the
Chickahominy which had only partially been destroyed.On the afternoon of
June 26th, General A. P. Hill crossed at Meadow Bridge, driving the Union
skirmish-line back to Beaver Dam Creek.The divisions of D. H. Hill and
Longstreet had been waiting at Mechanicsville Bridge (shown in this
photograph) since 8 A.M.for A. P. Hill to open the way for them to cross.They passed over in time to bear a decisive part in the Confederate attack
at Gaines' Mill on the 27th.[Illustration: DOING DOUBLE DUTY

little to do but wear gold lace and transmit orders.But it is their duty
to multiply the eyes and ears and thinking power of the leader.Without
them he could not direct the movements of his army.There were so few
regular officers of ripe experience that members of the staff were
invariably made regimental commanders, and frequently were compelled to
divide their time between leading their troops into action and reporting
to and consulting with their superior.[Illustration: THE RETROGRADE CROSSING.][Illustration: LOWER BRIDGE ON THE CHICKAHOMINY

engineers suspect, when they built this bridge, early in June, 1862, as a
means of communication between the divided wings of McClellan's army on
the Chickahominy that it would be of incalculable service during battle.When the right wing, under General Fitz John Porter, was engaged on the
field of Gaines' Mill against almost the entire army of Lee, across this
bridge the division of General Slocum marched from its position in the
trenches in front of Richmond on the south bank of the river to the
support of Porter's men.The battle lasted until nightfall and then the
Federal troops moved across this bridge and rejoined the main forces of
the Federal army.Woodbury's engineers built several bridges across the
Chickahominy, but among them all the bridge named for their commander
proved to be, perhaps, the most serviceable.[Illustration: A VAIN RIDE TO SAFETY]

During the retreat after Gaines' Mill, McClellan's army was straining
every nerve to extricate itself and present a strong front to Lee before
he could strike a telling blow at its untenable position.Wagon trains
were struggling across the almost impassable White Oak Swamp, while the
troops were striving to hold Savage's Station to protect the movement.Thither on flat cars were sent the wounded as we see them in the picture.The rear guard of the Army of the Potomac had hastily provided such field
hospital facilities as they could.We see the camp near the railroad with
the passing wagon trains in the lower picture.But attention to these
wounded men was, perforce, secondary to the necessity of holding the
position.Their hopes of relief from their suffering were to be blighted.Lee was about to fall upon the Federal rear guard at Savage's Station.Instead of to a haven of refuge, these men were being railroaded toward
the field of carnage, where they must of necessity be left by their
retreating companions.[Illustration: THE STAND AT SAVAGE'S STATION

rifled gun, mounted on car-wheels.They turned its deadly fire steadily
upon the defenders.The Federals fought fiercely and managed to hold their
ground till nightfall, when hundreds of their bravest soldiers lay on the
field and had to be left alone with their wounded comrades who had arrived
on the flat cars.[Illustration: A GRIM CAPTURE

brave medical officers behind, doing what they could to relieve the
sufferings of the men that had to be abandoned.Here we see them at work
upon the wounded, who have been gathered from the field.Nothing but the
strict arrest of the stern sergeant Death can save these men from capture,
and when the Confederates occupied Savage's Station on the morning of June
30th, twenty-five hundred sick and wounded men and their medical
attendants became prisoners of war.The Confederate hospital facilities
were already taxed to their full capacity in caring for Lee's wounded, and
most of these men were confronted on that day with the prospect of
lingering for months in the military prisons of the South.The brave
soldiers lying helpless here were wounded at Gaines' Mill on June 27th and
removed to the great field-hospital established at Savage's Station.The

_Copyright by Patriot Pub.Co._]

Through this well-nigh impassable morass of White Oak Swamp, across a
single long bridge, McClellan's wagon trains were being hurried the last
days of June, 1862.On the morning of the 30th, the rear-guard of the army
was hastily tramping after them, and by ten o'clock had safely crossed and

after the victory of July 1, 1862, and the army marched to a new base
farther down the James, where the heavy losses of men and supplies during
the Seven Days could be made up without danger and delay.Harrison's

completed the withdrawal of his army to Harrison's Landing.It was his

any attempt to fall upon the retreating trains and troops.A dense fog in
the early morning shut off the forces of A. P. Hill and Longstreet from
his view.He had not a single fieldpiece with which to resist attack.When
the mist cleared away, he kept up a great activity with his cavalry
horses, making the Confederates believe that artillery was being brought
up.With apparent reluctance he agreed to a truce of two hours in which
the Confederates might bury the dead they left on the hillside the day
before.Later, with an increased show of unwillingness, he extended the
truce for another two hours.Just before they expired, Frank's Battery
arrived to his support, with the news that the Army of the Potomac was
safe.Colonel Averell rejoined it without the loss of a man.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE THIRD PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY]

AFTER THE SEVEN DAYS

Within a week of the occupation of Harrison's Landing, McClellan's
position had become so strong that the Federal commander no longer
anticipated an attack by the Confederate forces.General Lee saw that his
opponent was flanked on each side by a creek and that approach to his
front was commanded by the guns in the entrenchments and those of the
Federal navy in the river.Lee therefore deemed it inexpedient to attack,
especially as his troops were in poor condition owing to the incessant
marching and fighting of the Seven Days.Rest was what both armies needed
most, and on July 8th the Confederate forces returned to the vicinity of
Richmond.McClellan scoured the country before he was satisfied of the
Confederate withdrawal.The Third and Fourth Pennsylvania cavalry made a
reconnaisance to Charles City Court House and beyond, and General Averell
reported on July 11th that there were no Southern troops south of the
lower Chickahominy.His scouting expeditions extended in the direction of
Richmond and up the Chickahominy.[Illustration: CHARLES CITY COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA, JULY, 1862

THE FEDERAL DEFENDER OF CORINTH

[Illustration]

THE MAN WHO KEPT THE KEY IN THE WEST

GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS

The possession of Corinth, Miss., meant the control of the railroads
without which the Federal armies could not push down the Mississippi
Valley and eastward into Tennessee.Autumn found Rosecrans with about
23,000 men in command at the post where were vast quantities of military
stores.On October 3, the indomitable Confederate leaders, Price and Van
Dorn, appeared before Corinth, and Rosecrans believing the movement to be
a feint sent forward a brigade to an advanced position on a hill.A sharp
battle ensued and in a brilliant charge the Confederates at last possessed
the hill.Convinced that there was really to be a determined assault on
Corinth, Rosecrans disposed his forces during the night.Just before dawn
the Confederate cannonade began, the early daylight was passed in
skirmishing, while the artillery duel grew hotter.Then a glittering
column of Price's men burst from the woods.Grape and canister were poured
into them, but on they came, broke through the Federal center and drove
back their opponents to the square of the town.Here the Confederates were
at last swept back.But ere that Van Dorn's troops had hurled themselves
on Battery Robinett to the left of the Federal line, and fought their way
over the parapet and into the battery.Federal
troops well placed in concealment rose up and poured volley after volley
into them.Rosecrans by a
well-planned defense had kept the key to Grant's subsequent control of the
West.[Illustration: GENERAL EARL VAN DORN, C. S.THE CONFEDERATE COMMANDER AT CORINTH

General Earl Van Dorn was born in Mississippi in 1821; he was graduated
from West Point in 1842, and was killed in a personal quarrel in 1863.Early in the war General Van Dorn had distinguished himself by capturing
the steamer "Star of the West" at Indianola, Texas.He was of a
tempestuous nature and had natural fighting qualities.During the month of
August he commanded all the Confederate troops in Mississippi except those
under General Price, and it was his idea to form a combined movement with
the latter's forces and expel the invading Federals from the northern
portion of his native State and from eastern Tennessee.The concentration
was made and the Confederate army, about 22,000 men, was brought into the
disastrous battle of Corinth.Brave were the charges made on the
entrenched positions, but without avail.[Illustration: GENERAL STERLING PRICE, C. S.THE CONFEDERATE SECOND IN COMMAND

General Sterling Price was a civilian who by natural inclination turned to
soldiering.He had been made a brigadier-general during the Mexican War,
but early allied himself with the cause of the Confederacy.At Pea Ridge,
only seven months before the battle of Corinth, he had been wounded.Of
the behavior of his men, though they were defeated and turned back on the
4th, he wrote that it was with pride that sisters and daughters of the
South could say of the officers and men, "My brother, father, fought at
Corinth."General Van Dorn, in referring to
the end of that bloody battle, wrote these pathetic words: "Exhausted from
loss of sleep, wearied from hard marching and fighting, companies and
regiments without officers, our troops--let no one censure them--gave way.[Illustration: BEFORE THE SOD HID THEM

[Illustration: GENERAL JOHN POPE]

THE UNFORTUNATE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF VIRGINIA

A SWIFT TURN OF FORTUNE'S WHEEL

Perhaps there is no more pathetic figure in the annals of the War than
Pope.In the West, that fiery furnace where the North's greatest generals
were already being molded, he stood out most prominently in the Spring of
1862.At Washington, the administration was cudgeling its brains for means
to meet the popular clamor for an aggressive campaign against Lee after
the Peninsula fiasco.Pope was sent for and arrived in Washington in June.When the plan to place him at the head of an army whose three corps
commanders all outranked him, was proposed, he begged to be sent back
West.But he was finally persuaded to undertake a task, the magnitude of
which was not yet appreciated at the North.During a month of preparation
he was too easily swayed by the advice and influenced by the plans of
civilians, and finally issued a flamboyant address to his army ending with
the statement, "My headquarters will be in the saddle."When this was
shown to Lee, he grimly commented, "Perhaps his headquarters will be where
his hindquarters ought to be."There followed the brief campaign, the
stunning collision with the solid front of Stonewall Jackson at Cedar
Mountain, and the clever strategy that took Pope at a disadvantage on the
old battlefield of Bull Run.Thence his army retreated more badly beaten
from a military standpoint than the rout which fled the same field a year
before.A brief summer had marked the rise and fall of Pope.Two years
later Sherman bade good-bye to his friend Grant also summoned from the
West."Remember Pope," was the gist of his warning; "don't stay in
Washington; keep in the field."CEDAR MOUNTAIN

    The Army of Virginia, under Pope, is now to bear the brunt of Lee's
    assault, while the Army of the Potomac is dismembered and sent back
    whence it came, to add in driblets to Pope's effective.--_Colonel
    Theodore A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye View of the Civil War."_


General George B. McClellan, with all his popularity at the beginning, had
failed in his Peninsula campaign to fulfil the expectations of the great
impatient public of the North.At the same time, while the Army of the
Potomac had as yet won no great victories, the men of the West could
triumphantly exhibit the trophies won at Donelson, at Pea Ridge, at
Shiloh, and at Island No.The North thereupon came to believe that the
Western leaders were more able than those of the East.This belief was
shared by the President and his Secretary of War and it led to the
determination to call on the West for help.The first to be called was General John Pope, who had won national fame by
capturing New Madrid and Island No.In answer
to a telegram from Secretary Stanton, Pope came to Washington in June,
1862.The secretary disclosed the plans on which he and President Lincoln
had agreed, that a new army, to be known as the Army of Virginia, was to
be created out of three corps, then under the respective commands of
Generals McDowell, N. P. Banks, and John C. Fremont.These corps had been
held from the Peninsula campaign for the purpose of protecting Washington.Pope demurred and begged to be sent back to the West, on the ground that
each of the three corps commanders was his senior in rank and that his
being placed at their head would doubtless create a feeling against him.But his protests were of no avail and he assumed command of the Army of
Virginia on the 26th of June.McDowell and Banks made no protest; but
Fremont refused to serve under one whom he considered his junior, and
resigned his position.His corps was assigned to General Franz Sigel.The new commander, General Pope, on the 14th of July, issued an address to
his army that was hardly in keeping with his modesty in desiring at first
to decline the honor that was offered him."I have come to you from the
West," he proclaimed, "where we have always seen the backs of our
enemies--from an army whose business it has been to seek the adversary and
to beat him when found.... Meantime I desire you to dismiss from your
minds certain phrases which I am sorry to find much in vogue among you.I
hear constantly of... lines of retreat and bases of supplies.Let us
discard such ideas.... Let us look before us and not behind."The immediate object of General Pope was to make the capital secure, to
make advances toward Richmond, and, if possible, to draw a portion of
Lee's army away from McClellan.From
this town, not far from the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains, there was a
railroad connecting it with Richmond--a convenient means of furnishing men
and supplies to the Confederate army.Pope decided to occupy the town and
destroy the railroad.To this end he ordered Banks to Culpeper and thence
to send all his cavalry to Gordonsville, capture the town and tear up ten
or fifteen miles of the railroad in the direction of Richmond.But, as if
a prelude to the series of defeats which General Pope was to suffer in the
next six weeks, he failed in this initial movement.The sagacious Lee had
divined his intention and had sent General "Stonewall" Jackson with his
and General Ewell's divisions on July 13th, to occupy Gordonsville.Ewell
arrived in advance of Jackson and held the town for the Confederates.In the campaign we are describing Jackson was the most active and
conspicuous figure on the Confederate side.He rested at Gordonsville for
two weeks, recuperating his health and that of the army, which had been
much impaired in the malarial district of the Peninsula.The fresh
mountain air blowing down from the Blue Ridge soon brought back their
wonted vigor.On July 27th A. P. Hill was ordered to join him, and the
Confederate leader now had about twenty-five thousand men.The movement on Gordonsville was exactly in accordance with Jackson's own
ideas which he had urged upon Lee.Although believing McClellan to be in
an impregnable position on the Peninsula, it was not less evident to him
that the Union general would be unable to move further until his army had
been reorganized and reenforced.This was the moment, he argued, to strike
in another direction and carry the conflict into the Federal territory.An
army of at least sixty thousand should march into Maryland and appear
before the National Capital.President Davis could not be won over to the
plan while McClellan was still in a position to be reenforced by sea, but
Lee, seeing that McClellan remained inactive, had determined, by sending
Jackson westward, to repeat the successful tactics of the previous spring
in the Shenandoah valley.Such a move might result in the recall of
McClellan.No sooner had Halleck assumed command of all the
Northern armies than the matter of McClellan's withdrawal was agitated and
on August 3d the head of the Army of the Potomac, to his bitter
disappointment, was ordered to join Pope on the Rappahannock.Halleck was
much concerned as to how Lee would act during the Federal evacuation of
the Peninsula, uncertain whether the Confederates would attempt to crush
Pope before McClellan could reenforce him, or whether McClellan would be
attacked as soon as he was out of his strong entrenchments at Harrison's
Landing.The latter of the two possibilities seemed the more probable, and Pope was
therefore ordered to push his whole army toward Gordonsville, in the hope
that Lee, compelled to strengthen Jackson, would be too weak to fall upon
the retiring Army of the Potomac.The Union army now occupied the great triangle formed roughly by the
Rappahannock and the Rapidan rivers and the range of the Blue Ridge
Mountains, with Culpeper Court House as the rallying point.Pope soon
found that the capturing of New Madrid and Island No.10 was easy in
comparison with measuring swords with the Confederate generals in the
East.On August 6th Pope began his general advance upon Gordonsville.Banks
already had a brigade at Culpeper Court House, and this was nearest to
Jackson.The small settlement was the meeting place of four roads by means
of which Pope's army of forty-seven thousand men would be united.Jackson,
informed of the advance, immediately set his three divisions in motion for
Culpeper, hoping to crush Banks, hold the town, and prevent the uniting of
the Army of Virginia.The remainder of Banks's
corps reached Culpeper on the 8th.On the morning of the 9th Jackson
finally got his troops over the Rapidan and the Robertson rivers.Two
miles beyond the latter stream there rose from the plain the <DW72> of
Slaughter Mountain, whose ominous name is more often changed into Cedar.This "mountain" is an isolated foothill of the Blue Ridge, some twenty
miles from the parent range, and a little north of the Rapidan.From its
summit could be seen vast stretches of quiet farmlands which had borne
their annual harvests since the days of the Cavaliers.Its gentle <DW72>s
were covered with forests, which merged at length into waving grain fields
and pasture lands, dotted here and there with rural homes.It was here on
the <DW72> of Cedar Mountain that one of the most severe little battles of
the war took place.On the banks of Cedar Run, seven miles south of Culpeper and but one or
two north of the mountain, Banks's cavalry were waiting to oppose
Jackson's advance.Learning of this the latter halted and waited for an
attack.He placed Ewell's batteries on the <DW72> about two hundred feet
above the valley and sent General Winder to take a strong position on the
left.So admirably was Jackson's army stationed that it would have
required a much larger force, approaching it from the plains, to dislodge
it.And yet, General Banks made an attempt with an army scarcely one-third
as large as that of Jackson.General Pope had made glowing promises of certain success and he well knew
that the whole North was eagerly watching and waiting for him to fulfil
them.He must strike somewhere and do it soon--and here was his chance at
Cedar Mountain.He sent Banks with nearly eight thousand men against this
brilliant Southern commander with an army three times as large, holding a
strong position on a mountain side.Banks with his infantry left Culpeper Court House on the morning of August
9th and reached the Confederate stronghold in the afternoon.He approached
the mountain through open fields in full range of the Confederate cannon,
which presently opened with the roar of thunder.All heedless of danger
the brave men ran up the <DW72> as if to take the foe by storm, when
suddenly they met a brigade of Ewell's division face to face and a brief,
deadly encounter took place.In a few minutes the Confederate right flank
began to waver and would no doubt have been routed but for the timely aid
of another brigade and still another that rushed down the hill and opened
fire on the Federal lines which extended along the eastern bank of Cedar
Run.Meanwhile the Union batteries had been wheeled into position and their
deep roar answered that of the foe on the hill.For two or three hours the
battle continued with the utmost fury.The ground was strewn with dead and
dying and human blood was poured out like water.But the odds were too
great and at length, as the shades of evening were settling over the gory
field, Banks began to withdraw the remnant of his troops.But he left two
thousand of his brave lads--one fourth of his whole army--dead or dying
along the hillside, while the Confederate losses were in excess of
thirteen hundred.The dead and wounded of both armies lay mingled in masses over the whole
battle-field.While the fighting continued, neither side could send aid or
relief to the maimed soldiers, who suffered terribly from thirst and lack
of attention as the sultry day gave place to a close, oppressive night.General Pope had remained at Culpeper, but, hearing the continuous
cannonading and knowing that a sharp engagement was going on, hastened to
the battle-field in the afternoon with a fresh body of troops under
General Ricketts, arriving just before dark.He instantly ordered Banks to
withdraw his right wing so as to make room for Ricketts; but the
Confederates, victorious as they had been, refused to continue the contest
against the reenforcements and withdrew to the woods up the mountain side.Heavy shelling was kept up by the hard-worked artillerymen of both armies
until nearly midnight, while the Federal troops rested on their arms in
line of battle.For two days the armies faced each other across the
valley.Pope's first battle as leader of an
Eastern army had resulted in neither victory nor defeat.[Illustration: A BREATHING SPELL

McClellan went to the Peninsula in March of 1862 he had expected all of
McDowell's Corps to be sent him as reenforcement before he made the final
advance on Richmond.But the brilliant exploits of Jackson in the
Shenandoah required the retention of all the troops in the vicinity of
Washington.A new army, in fact, was created to make the campaign which
Lincoln had originally wanted McClellan to carry out.The command was
given to General John Pope, whose capture of Island No.10 in the
Mississippi had brought him into national importance.The corps of Banks,
Fremont, and McDowell were consolidated to form this new army, called the
"Army of Virginia."General Fremont refused to serve under his junior, and
his force was given to Franz Sigel, who had won fame in 1861 in Missouri.This picture was taken about two weeks after the reorganization was
completed.The soldiers are those of McDowell's Corps.They are on the old

seize Culpeper Court House, but the combat took place in the valley here

The Hero of the Federal Attack.General Samuel W. Crawford, here seen with

Confederate forces that came near being disastrous for Jackson.At about
six o'clock the brigade was in line.General Williams reported: "At this
time this brigade occupied the interior line of a strip of woods.A field,
varying from 250 to 500 yards in width, lay between it and the next strip
of woods.In moving across this field the three right regiments and the
six companies of the Third Wisconsin were received by a terrific fire of
musketry.The Third Wisconsin especially fell under a partial flank fire
under which Lieut.-Colonel Crane fell and the regiment was obliged to give
way.Of the three remaining regiments which continued the charge
(Twenty-eighth New York, Forty-sixth Pennsylvania, and Fifth Connecticut)
every field-officer and every adjutant was killed or disabled.In the
Twenty-eighth New York every company officer was killed or wounded; in the
Forty-sixth Pennsylvania all but five; in the Fifth Connecticut all but
eight."It was one of the most heroic combats of the war.ALFRED N. DUFFIE]

A Leader of Cavalry.Colonel Alfred N. Duffie was in command of the First
Rhode Island Cavalry, in the Cavalry Brigade of the Second Division of
McDowell's (Third) Corps in Pope's Army of Virginia.The cavalry had been
used pretty well during Pope's advance.On the 8th of August, the day
before the battle of Cedar Mountain, the cavalry had proceeded south to
the house of Dr.That night Duffie was on picket in advance of
General Crawford's troops, which had come up during the day and pitched
camp.The whole division came to his support on the next day.When the
infantry fell back to the protection of the batteries, the cavalry was
ordered to charge the advancing Confederates."Officers and men behaved
admirably, and I cannot speak too highly of the good conduct of all of the
brigade," reported General Bayard.After the battle the cavalry covered
the retreat of the artillery and ambulances.On August 18th, when the
retreat behind the Rappahannoc was ordered, the cavalry again checked the
Confederate advance.During the entire campaign the regiment of Colonel
Duffie did yeoman's service.[Illustration: THE FIRST CLASH

COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Battlefield of Cedar Mountain, August 9, 1862.Here the Confederate army
in its second advance on Washington first felt out the strength massed
against it.After Lee's brilliant tactics had turned McClellan's Peninsula
Campaign into a fiasco, the Confederate Government resolved to again take
the offensive.Plans were formed for a general invasion of the North, the
objective points ranging from Cincinnati eastward to the Federal capital
and Philadelphia.Immediately after Washington got wind of this, Lincoln
(on August 4th) issued a call for three hundred thousand men, and all
haste was made to rush the forces of McClellan from the Peninsula and of
Cox from West Virginia to the aid of the recently consolidated army under
Pope.On August 9, 1862, the vanguards of "Stonewall" Jackson's army and
of Pope's intercepting forces met at Cedar Mountain.Banks, with the
Second Corps of the Federal army, about eight thousand strong, attacked
Jackson's forces of some sixteen thousand.The charge was so furious that
Jackson's left flank was broken and rolled up, the rear of the center
fired upon, and the whole line thereby thrown into confusion.Banks,
however, received no reenforcements, while Jackson received strong
support.The Federal troops were driven back across the ground which they
had swept clear earlier in the afternoon.[Illustration]

the day after the battle that had raged for a brief two hours on the
previous evening.After an artillery fire that filled half the afternoon,
the advanced Federal cavalry was pressed back on the infantry supporting
the batteries.Banks underestimated the strength of the Confederates.Instead of sending to Pope for reenforcements, he ordered a charge on the
approaching troops.The Confederates, still feeling their way, were
unprepared for this movement and were thrown into confusion.But at the
moment when the Federal charge was about to end in success, three brigades
of A. P. Hill in reserve were called up.They forced the Federals to
retrace their steps to the point where the fighting began.Here the
Federal retreat, in turn, was halted by General Pope with reenforcements.The Confederates moving up their batteries, a short-range artillery fight
was kept up until midnight.At daylight it was found that Ewell and
Jackson had fallen back two miles farther up the mountain.Pope advanced
to the former Confederate ground and rested, after burying the dead.The
following morning the Confederates had disappeared.The loss to both
armies was almost three thousand in killed, wounded and missing.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: SURVIVORS OF THE FIGHTING TENTH

    The battle was indeed one of which General Lee had good reason to be
    proud.It would be hard to find a better instance of that masterly
    comprehension of the actual condition of things which marks a great
    general than was exhibited in General Lee's allowing our formidable
    attack, in which more than half the Federal army was taking part, to
    be fully developed and to burst upon the exhausted troops of Stonewall
    Jackson, while Lee, relying upon the ability of that able soldier to
    maintain his position, was maturing and arranging for the great attack
    on our left flank by the powerful corps of Longstreet.--_John C.
    Ropes, in "The Army Under Pope."_


The battle of Cedar Mountain was but a prelude to the far greater one that
was to take place three weeks later on the banks of the little stream that
had given its name, the year before, to the first important battle of the
war; and here again the result to be registered was similar to that of the
preceding year--a result that brought dismay to the people of the North
and exultation to the adherents of the Southern cause.The three
intervening weeks between the battles of Cedar Mountain and the Second
Bull Run were spent in sparring, in marshaling the armed hosts, in heavy
skirmishing and getting position for a final decisive struggle.The respective heroes
were J. E. B. Stuart, the daring Southern cavalry leader, and "Stonewall"
Jackson.Before relating these
incidents, however, we must take a general view of the field.General
Pope's headquarters at this moment were at Culpeper, with a large part of
his army, but he had left much of his personal baggage and many of his
private papers at Catlett's, a station on the Orange and Alexandria
Railroad between Culpeper and Manassas Junction, while his vast store of
army supplies was at the latter place.Pope's great source of uncertainty lay in the fact that he did not know
whether Lee would move against him or would follow McClellan in the
latter's retreat from the Peninsula; nor did he know when the
reenforcements promised from McClellan's army would reach him.Meanwhile
Lee had decided to let McClellan depart in peace and to advance against
Pope, with the whole Confederate army.To this end Longstreet was ordered
to the scene and with his corps he reached Gordonsville on August 13th.A few days later the two Confederate generals, Lee and Longstreet,
ascended to the top of Clark's Mountain, from which, through powerful
field-glasses, they obtained a good view of Culpeper, about twelve miles
away.They saw that Pope's position was weak and determined to attack him
without delay.Lee ordered his army to cross the Rapidan.He also sent a
courier to gallop across the country with an important dispatch to General
Stuart, disclosing his plans.It was now that General Pope met fortune; he
captured the courier and learned of Lee's plans.Pope knew that he was not
in position to meet Lee's army at Culpeper, and he withdrew from that
place and took up a strong position behind the Rappahannock.Lee had
strained every nerve to get at his antagonist before the latter left
Culpeper and before he could be reenforced by McClellan's army.But sudden
rains changed the Rappahannock from a placid stream into a rushing
torrent.The Confederates were delayed and meantime the reenforcements
from the Peninsula began to reach Pope's army.General Reno with a part of
Burnside's corps was on the ground by August 14th.One week later came
Generals Kearny and Reynolds--both splendid leaders, both destined to give
their lives for their country within a year--to join the Army of Virginia
with some thousands of additional fighters from the Army of the Potomac.Lee was completely thwarted in his purpose of attacking Pope before his
reenforcements arrived.He sent the dauntless cavalry
leader, J. E. B. Stuart, to make a raid around the Union army.Stuart did
this effectively, and this was the first of the two notable events of
these weeks of sparring.Crossing the Rappahannock at Waterloo Bridge with
fifteen hundred mounted men as bold and dauntless as himself, Stuart
dashed up the country, riding all day and all night.After the coming of
night on the evening of the 22d, in the midst of a torrential rainstorm,
while the darkness was so intense that every man was guided by the tread
of his brother horsemen, Stuart pounced upon the Federals near Catlett's
Station, overpowered the astonished guard, captured nearly two hundred
prisoners, scattering the remainder of the troops stationed there far and
wide in the darkness, and seized Pope's despatch-book with his plans and
private papers.Stuart took also several hundred fine horses and burned a
large number of wagons laden with supplies.Among his trophies was a fine
uniform cloak and hat which were the personal property of General Pope.These were exchanged on the following day for General Stuart's plumed hat
which a few days before had been left behind by that officer when
surprised by Federal troops.Stuart's bold raid proved a serious misfortune for the Union army.But Lee
had far greater things in store.His next move was to send Jackson to
Pope's rear with a large part of the Confederate army.Stealthily Jackson
led his army westward, shielded by the woods, the thickets, and the low
hills of the Blue Ridge.It was a quiet rural community through which he
passed.The great majority of the simple country folk had never seen an
army, though it is true that for many days the far-away boom of cannon had
reached their ears from the valley of the Rapidan.Now here was a real
army at their very doors.Nor was it a hostile army, for their sympathies
were Southern.With baskets and armfuls of bread and pies and cakes they
cheered as best they could the tattered and hungry men on the march.General Lee in the meantime had kept Longstreet in front of Pope's army on
the Rappahannock to make daily demonstrations and feints and thus to
divert Pope's attention from Jackson's movements and lead him to believe
that he was to be attacked in front."Stonewall" Jackson suddenly, on August 26th, emerged from the Bull Run
Mountains by way of the Thoroughfare Gap and marshaled his clans on the
plains of Manassas, but a few miles from the site of the famous battle of
the year before.He was astonished to find Jackson in his rear, and
he had to decide instantly between two courses to abandon his
communications with Fredericksburg on the one hand, or with Alexandria and
Washington on the other.He decided to keep in touch with Washington at
all hazards.Breaking his camp on the Rappahannock, he hastened with all
speed to lead his forces toward Manassas Junction, where he had stored
vast quantities of provisions and munitions of war.But he was too late to
save them.Jackson had been joined by Stuart and his cavalry.On the
evening of the 26th they were still some miles from Manassas and Trimble
was sent ahead to make sure the capture before Pope's army could arrive.Through the darkness rode these same hardy men who had a few nights before
made their bold raid on Catlett's Station.The
spoils of this capture were great, including three hundred prisoners, one
hundred and seventy-five horses, ten locomotives, seven long trains of
provisions, and vast stores and munitions of war.Next morning the weary and hungry foot soldiers of Jackson's army came
upon the scene and whatever else they did they feasted as only hungry men
can.An eye-witness wrote, "To see a starving man eating lobster-salad
and drinking Rhine wine, barefooted and in tatters, was curious; the
whole thing was incredible."The amazement at the North when the news of the capture of Manassas became
known cannot be described.But the newspapers belittled it, declaring that
it was merely a bold raid and that for any large force to get between
Pope's army and Washington before Pope became aware of the attempt was
simply impossible.But his position was precarious,
nevertheless.Pope was moving toward him with a far larger army, recently
augmented by Heintzelman's corps from the Army of the Potomac, while Fitz
John Porter with an additional force was not far off.It is true that
Longstreet was hastening to the aid of Jackson, but he had to come by the
same route which had brought Jackson--through Thoroughfare Gap--and Pope
thought he saw a great opportunity.If he could only detain Longstreet at
the gap, why should he not crush Jackson with his superior numbers?To
this end he sent orders to Porter, to McDowell, and to Kearny and others
whose forces were scattered about the country, to concentrate during the
night of the 27th and move upon Jackson.McDowell sent Ricketts with a
small force--too small to prevent Longstreet from passing through
Thoroughfare Gap, and hastened to join the main army against Jackson.But
that able commander was not to be caught in a trap.He moved from Manassas
Junction by three roads toward the old battle-field of Bull Run and by
noon on the 28th the whole corps was once more united between Centreville
and Sudley Spring.Late in the day he encountered King's division of
McDowell's corps near the village of Groveton, and a sharp fight was
opened and kept up till an hour after dark.The Confederates were left in
possession of the field.The following day, August 29th, was the first of the two days' battle,
leaving out of account the fight of the evening before and the desultory
fighting of the preceding ten days.General Pope was still hopeful of
crushing Jackson before the arrival of Longstreet, and on the morning of
the 29th he ordered a general advance across Bull Run.As the noon hour
approached a wild shout that arose from Jackson's men told too well of the
arrival of Longstreet.Far away on the hills near Gainesville could be
seen the marching columns of Longstreet, who had passed through the gap in
safety and who was now rushing to the support of Jackson.The Confederate
army was at last to be reunited.Pope had
lost his opportunity of fighting the army of his opponent in sections.The field was almost the same that the opposing forces had occupied a year
and a month before when the first great battle of the war was fought.And
many of them were the same men.Some who had engaged in that first
conflict had gone home and had refused to reenlist; others had found
soldiers' graves since then--but still others on both sides were here
again, no longer the raw recruits that they were before, but, with their
year of hard experience in the field, they were trained soldiers, equal to
any in the world.The two armies faced each other in a line nearly five miles long.There
was heavy fighting here and there along the line from the early morning
hours, but no general engagement until late in the afternoon.The Union
right pressed hard against the Confederate left and by ten o'clock had
forced it back more than a mile.But the Confederates, presently
reenforced in that quarter, hurled heavy masses of infantry against the
Union right and regained much that it had lost.Late in the afternoon
fresh regiments under Kearny and Hooker charged the Confederate left,
which was swept back and rolled in upon the center.But presently the
Southern General Hood, with his famous Texan brigade, rushed forward in a
wild, irresistible dash, pressed Kearny back, captured one gun, several
flags and a hundred prisoners.Night then closed over the scene and the
two armies rested on their arms until the morning.The first day's battle is sometimes called the battle of Groveton, but
usually it is considered as the first half of the second battle of Bull
Run.The Union loss was at least
forty-five hundred men, the Confederate was somewhat larger.Over the gory
field lay multitudes of men, the blue and the gray commingled, who would
dream of battlefields no more.The living men lay down among the dead in
order to snatch a little rest and strength that they might renew the
strife in the morning.It is a strange fact that Lee and Pope each believed that the other would
withdraw his army during the night, and each was surprised in the morning
to find his opponent still on the ground, ready, waiting, defiant.It was
quite certain that on this day, August 30th, there would be a decisive
action and that one of the two armies would be victor and the other
defeated.The two opposing commanders had called in their outlying
battalions and the armies now faced each other in almost full force, the
Confederates with over fifty thousand men and the Union forces exceeding
their opponents by probably fifteen thousand men.The Confederate left
wing was commanded by Jackson, and the right by Longstreet.The extreme
left of the Union army was under Fitz John Porter, who, owing to a
misunderstanding of orders, had not reached the field the day before.The
center was commanded by Heintzelman and the right by Reno.In the early hours of the morning the hills echoed with the firing of
artillery, with which the day was opened.Porter made an infantry attack
in the forenoon, but was met by the enemy in vastly superior numbers and
was soon pressed back in great confusion.As the hours passed one fearful
attack followed another, each side in turn pressing forward and again
receding.In the afternoon a large part of the Union army made a
desperate onslaught on the Confederate left under Jackson.Here for some
time the slaughter of men was fearful.Jackson saw
that his lines were wavering.He called for reenforcements which did not
come and it seemed as if the Federals were about to win a signal victory.Far away on a little hill at the Confederate right
Longstreet placed four batteries in such a position that he could enfilade
the Federal columns.Quickly he trained his cannon on the Federal lines
that were hammering away at Jackson, and opened fire.Ghastly gaps were
soon cut in the Federal ranks and they fell back.But they re-formed and
came again and still again, each time only to be mercilessly cut down by
Longstreet's artillery.At length Longstreet's whole line rushed forward,
and with the coming of darkness, the whole Union front began to waver.General Lee, seeing this, ordered the Confederates in all parts of the
field to advance.It was now dark
and there was little more fighting; but Lee captured several thousand
prisoners.Pope retreated across Bull Run with the remnant of his army and
by morning was ensconced behind the field-works at Centreville.There was no mistaking the fact that General Pope had lost the battle and
the campaign.He decided to lead his army back to the entrenchments of
Washington.After spending a day behind the embankments at Centreville,
the retreat was begun.Lee's troops with Jackson in the advance pursued
and struck a portion of the retreating army at Chantilly.It was late in the afternoon of September 1st.The rain, accompanied by
vivid lightning and terrific crashes of thunder, was falling in torrents
as Stuart's horsemen, sent in advance, were driven back by the Federal
infantry.Jackson now pushed two of A. P. Hill's brigades forward to
ascertain the condition of the Union army.General Reno was protecting
Pope's right flank, and he lost no time in proceeding against Hill.The
latter was promptly checked, and both forces took position for battle.One side and then the other fell back in turn as lines were re-formed and
urged forward.Night fell and the tempest's fury increased.The ammunition
of both armies was so wet that much of it could not be used.Try as they
would the Confederates were unable to break the Union line and the two
armies finally withdrew.The Confederates suffered a loss of five hundred
men in their unsuccessful attempt to demoralize Pope in his retreat, and
the Federals more than a thousand, including Generals Stevens and Kearny.General Kearny might have been saved but for his reckless bravery.He was
rounding up the retreat of his men in the darkness of the night when he
chanced to come within the Confederate lines.Called on to surrender, he
lay flat on his horse's back, sank his spurs into its sides, and attempted
to escape.Half a dozen muskets were leveled and fired at the fleeing
general.Within thirty yards he rolled from his horse's back dead.The consternation in Washington and throughout the North when Pope's
defeated army reached Arlington Heights can better be imagined than
described.General Pope, who bore the brunt of public indignation, begged
to be relieved of the command.The President complied with his wishes and
the disorganized remnants of the Army of Virginia and the Army of the
Potomac were handed to the "Little Napoleon" of Peninsula fame, George B.
McClellan.The South was overjoyed with its victory--twice it had unfurled its banner
in triumph on the battlefield at Manassas by the remarkable strategy of
its generals and the courage of its warriors on the firing-line.Twice it
had stood literally on the road that led to the capital of the Republic,
only by some strange destiny of war to fail to enter its precincts on the
wave of victory.[Illustration: THE UNHEEDED WARNING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here we see Catlett's Station, on the Orange & Alexandria Railroad, which
Stuart's cavalry seized in a night sortie on August 22, 1862.Stuart was unable to burn the loaded wagon-trains
surrounding the station and had to content himself with capturing horses,
which he mounted with wounded Federal soldiers; he escaped at four the
next morning, driven off by the approach of a superior force.Pope, at the
time, was in possession of the fords of the Rappahannock, trying to check
the Confederate advance toward the Shenandoah.Stuart's raid, however, so
alarmed General Halleck that he immediately telegraphed Pope from
Washington: "By no means expose your railroad communication with
Alexandria.It is of the utmost importance in sending your supplies and
reinforcements."Pope did not fall back upon his railroad communication,
however, until after Jackson had seized Manassas Junction.[Illustration: CATLETT'S STATION]

At Manassas Junction, as it appeared in the upper picture on August 26,
1862, is one of the great neglected strategic points in the theater of the
war.Twenty-five miles from Alexandria and thirty miles in a direct line
from Washington, it was almost within long cannon-shot from any point in
both the luckless battles of Bull Run.It was on the railway route
connecting with Richmond, and at the junction of the railway running
across the entrance to the Shenandoah Valley and beyond the Blue Ridge,
through Manassas Gap.The Confederates knew its value, and after the first
battle of Bull Run built the fortifications which we see in the upper
picture, to the left beyond the supply-cars on the railroad.Pope, after
the battle of Cedar Mountain, should have covered it, extending his lines
so as to protect it from Jackson's incursion through Thoroughfare Gap;
instead he held the main force of his army opposing that of Lee.[Illustration: WHERE THE THUNDERBOLT FELL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The havoc wrought by the Confederate attack of August 26th on the Federal
supply depot at Manassas Junction is here graphically preserved.When
Jackson arrived at sunset of that day at Bristoe's Station, on the Orange
& Alexandria Railroad, he knew that his daring movement would be reported
to Pope's forces by the trains that escaped both north and south.To save
themselves, the troops that had already marched twenty-five miles had to
make still further exertions.Trimble volunteered to move on Manassas
Junction; and, under command of Stuart, a small force moved northward
through the woods.At midnight it arrived within half a mile of the
Junction.The Federal force greeted it with artillery fire, but when the
Confederates charged at the sound of the bugle the gunners abandoned the
batteries to the assaulters.Some three hundred of the small Federal
garrison were captured, with the immense stores that filled the warehouses
to overflowing.The next morning Hill's and Taliaferro's divisions arrived
to hold the position.The half-starved troops were now in possession of
all that was needed to make them an effective force.Jackson was now in
position to control the movements of the Federal army under Pope.[Illustration: GUARDING THE "O.NEAR UNION MILLS

and the single-track railroad was inadequate.[Illustration: DEBRIS FROM JACKSON'S RAID ON THE ORANGE AND ALEXANDRIA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This is part of the result of General Pope's too rapid advance to head off
Lee's army south of the Rappahannock River.Although overtaking the
advance of the Confederates at Cedar Mountain, Pope had arrived too late
to close the river passes against them.Meanwhile he had left the Orange &
Alexandria Railroad uncovered, and Jackson pushed a large force under
General Ewell forward across the Bull Run Mountains.On the night of
August 26, 1863, Ewell's forces captured Manassas Junction, while four
miles above the Confederate cavalry fell upon an empty railroad train
returning from the transfer of Federal troops.Here we see how well the work was done.THE TRAIN "STONEWALL" JACKSON AND STUART STOPPED AT BRISTOE

[Illustration]

By a move of unparalleled boldness, "Stonewall" Jackson, with twenty
thousand men, captured the immense Union supplies at Manassas Junction,
August 26, 1862.Washington lay one day's
march to the north; Warrenton, Pope's headquarters, but twelve miles
distant to the southwest; and along the Rappahannock, between "Stonewall"
Jackson and Lee, stood the tents of another host which outnumbered the
whole Confederate army."Stonewall" Jackson had seized Bristoe Station in
order to break down the railway bridge over Broad Run, and to proceed at
his leisure with the destruction of the stores.A train returning empty
from Warrenton Junction to Alexandria darted through the station under
heavy fire.Two trains which followed in
the same direction as the first went crashing down a high embankment.The
report received at Alexandria from the train which escaped ran as follows:
"No.6 train, engine Secretary, was fired into at Bristoe by a party of
cavalry some five hundred strong.They had piled ties on the track, but
the engine threw them off.It
was a full day before the Federals realized that "Stonewall" Jackson was
really there with a large force.Here, in abundance, was all that had been
absent for some time; besides commissary stores of all sorts, there were
two trains loaded with new clothing, to say nothing of sutler's stores,
replete with "extras" not enumerated in the regulations, and also the camp
of a cavalry regiment which had vacated in favor of Jackson's men.It was
an interesting sight to see the hungry, travel-worn men attacking this
profusion and rewarding themselves for all their fatigues and deprivations
of the preceding few days, and their enjoyment of it and of the day's rest
allowed them.There was a great deal of difficulty for a time in finding
what each man needed most, but this was overcome through a crude barter of
belongings as the day wore on.[Illustration]


[Illustration: A START TOO LONG DELAYED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Where the troops of General McClellan, waiting near the round-house at
Alexandria, were hurried forward to the scene of action where Pope was
struggling with Jackson and Ewell.Pope had counted upon the assistance of
these reenforcements in making the forward movement by which he expected
to hold Lee back.The old bogey of leaving the National Capital
defenseless set up a vacillation in General Halleck's mind and the troops
were held overlong at Alexandria.Had they been promptly forwarded,
"Stonewall" Jackson's blow at Manassas Junction could not have been
struck.At the news of that disaster the troops were hurriedly despatched
down the railroad toward Manassas.But Pope was already in retreat in
three columns toward that point, McDowell had failed to intercept the
Confederate reenforcements coming through Thoroughfare Gap, and the
situation had become critical.General Taylor, with his brigade of New
Jersey troops, was the first of McClellan's forces to be moved forward to
the aid of Pope.At Union Mills, Colonel Scammon, commanding the First
Brigade, driven back from Manassas Junction, was further pressed by the
Confederates on the morning of August 27th.Later in the day General
Taylor's brigade arrived by the Fairfax road and, crossing the railroad
bridge, met the Confederates drawn up and waiting near Manassas Station.A
severe artillery fire greeted the Federals as they emerged from the woods.As General Taylor had no artillery, he was obliged either to retire or
charge.When the Confederate cavalry threatened to
surround his small force, however, Taylor fell back in good order across
the bridge, where two Ohio regiments assisted in holding the Confederates
in check.At this point, General Taylor, who had been wounded in the
retreat, was borne past in a litter.Though suffering much, he appealed to
the officers to prevent another Bull Run.The brigade retired in good
order to Fairfax Court House, where General Taylor died of his wounds a
short time afterward.[Illustration: BRIGADIER-GENERAL GEORGE W. TAYLOR]


[Illustration: AN UNREALIZED OPPORTUNITY]

Here might have been won a Federal victory that would have precluded
defeat at Second Bull Run.The corps of General Heintzelman, consisting of
the divisions of Hooker and Kearny, was the next detachment of McClellan's
forces to arrive to the aid of Pope.On the 28th of August, Heintzelman
had pushed forward to Centreville, entering it soon after "Stonewall"
Jackson's rear-guard had retired.Instead of pursuing, Heintzelman drew up
his forces east of Cub Run, which we see in the picture.Jackson's forces,
now in a precarious position, fell back toward Thoroughfare Gap to form a
junction with Longstreet's Corps, which Lee had sent forward.The battle
was commenced on the west somewhat feebly by Generals McDowell and Sigel.By nightfall the Confederate left had been driven back fully a mile.[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SAMUEL P. HEINTZELMAN AND STAFF

Sleeping on their arms on the night of August 29th, the Federal veterans
were as confident of having won a victory as were the raw troops in the
beginning of the first battle of Bull Run.But the next day's fighting was
to tell the tale.General Ewell had been wounded in the knee by a minie
ball in the severe fight at Groveton and was unable to lead his command;
but for the impetuosity of this commander was substituted that of
Longstreet, nicknamed "the War-Horse," whose arrival in the midst of the
previous day's engagement had cost the Federals dear.On the morning of
the second day Longstreet's batteries opened the engagement.When the
general advance came, as the sun shone on the parallel lines of glittering
bayonets, it was Longstreet's men bringing their muskets to "the ready"
who first opened fire with a long flash of flame.It was they who pressed
most eagerly forward and, in the face of the Federal batteries, fell upon
the troops of General McDowell at the left and drove them irresistibly
back.Although the right Federal wing, in command of General Heintzelman,
had not given an inch, it was this turning of the left by Longstreet which
put the whole Federal army in retreat, driving them across Bull Run.The
Confederates were left in possession of the field, where lay thousands of
Federal dead and wounded, and Lee was free to advance his victorious
troops into the North unmolested.[Illustration: THE BATTLE-FIELD OF SECOND BULL RUN (MANASSAS), AUGUST

for with the regiment that came up at the double quick galloped a battery

assailed time and again.It became the center of the sanguinary combat of
the day, and it was here that the "Bull-Dogs" earned their name.Among the
first to respond to Lincoln's call, they enlisted in June, '61, and when

Revolution and Minister to the Court of St.He had left the army in
1836 to become Assistant Engineer of the New York & Erie Railroad, a post
he gave up to become editor of the _Daily Advertiser_, and subsequently of
the Milwaukee _Sentinel_.At the outbreak of the war Lincoln had appointed
him Minister to Rome, but he asked permission to delay his departure, and
was made a Brigadier-General of Volunteers.Later he resigned as Minister,
and was assigned to McDowell's corps.At the battle of Manassas, in which
the Forty-first New York earned honor, he proved an able leader.In 1867
he was again appointed as Minister of the United States to Italy.[Illustration: THE GENERAL-IN-CHIEF IN 1862]

importuned by both Grant and Foote, authorized the joint expedition into
Tennessee, and after its successful outcome he telegraphed to Washington:
"Make Buell, Grant, and Pope major-generals of volunteers and give me

chosen to be General-in-Chief of the Federal Armies at the crisis created

West, finally superseded him at Washington.[Illustration: AT ANTIETAM._Painted by E. Jahn._

ANTIETAM, OR SHARPSBURG

    At Sharpsburg (Antietam) was sprung the keystone of the arch upon
    which the Confederate cause rested.--_James Longstreet,
    Lieutenant-General C. S. A., in "Battles and Leaders of the Civil
    War."_


A battle remarkable in its actualities but more wonderful in its
possibilities was that of Antietam, with the preceding capture of Harper's
Ferry and the other interesting events that marked the invasion of
Maryland by General Lee.It was one of the bloodiest and the most
picturesque conflicts of the Civil War, and while it was not all that the
North was demanding and not all that many military critics think it might
have been, it enabled President Lincoln to feel that he could with some
assurance issue, as he did, his Emancipation Proclamation.Lee's army, fifty thousand strong, had crossed the Potomac at Leesburg and
had concentrated around Frederick, the scene of the Barbara Frietchie
legend, only forty miles from Washington.When it became known that Lee,
elated by his victory at Second Bull Run, had taken the daring step of
advancing into Maryland, and now threatened the capital of the Republic,
McClellan, commanding the Army of the Potomac, pushed his forces forward
to encounter the invaders.Harper's Ferry, at the junction of the Potomac
and the Shenandoah rivers, was a valuable defense against invasion through
the Valley of Virginia, but once the Confederates had crossed it, a
veritable trap.General Halleck ordered it held and General Lee sent
"Stonewall" Jackson to take it, by attacking the fortress on the Virginia
side.Jackson began his march on September 10th with secret instructions from
his commander to encompass and capture the Federal garrison and the vast
store of war material at this place, made famous a few years before by old
John Brown.To conceal his purpose from the inhabitants he inquired along
the route about the roads leading into Pennsylvania.It was from his march
through Frederick that the Barbara Frietchie story took its rise.But
there is every reason to believe that General Jackson never saw the good
old lady, that the story is a myth, and that Mr.Whittier, who has given
us the popular poem under the title of her name, was misinformed.However,
Colonel H. K. Douglas, who was a member of Jackson's staff, relates, in
"Battles and Leaders of the Civil War," an interesting incident where his
commander on entering Middletown was greeted by two young girls waving a
Union flag.The general bowed to the young women, raised his hat, and
remarked to some of his officers, "We evidently have no friends in this
town."Colonel Douglas concludes, "This is about the way he would have
treated Barbara Frietchie."On the day after Jackson left Frederick he crossed the Potomac by means of
a ford near Williamsport and on the 13th he reached Bolivar Heights.Harper's Ferry lies in a deep basin formed by Maryland Heights on the
north bank of the Potomac, Loudon Heights on the south bank, and Bolivar
Heights on the west.The Shenandoah River breaks through the pass between
Loudon and Bolivar Heights and the village lies between the two at the
apex formed by the junction of the two rivers.As Jackson approached the place by way of Bolivar Heights, Walker occupied
Loudon Heights and McLaws invested Maryland Heights.All were unopposed
except McLaws, who encountered Colonel Ford with a force to dispute his
ascent.Ford, however, after some resistance, spiked his guns and retired
to the Ferry, where Colonel Miles had remained with the greater portion of
the Federal troops.Had Miles led his entire force to Maryland Heights he
could no doubt have held his ground until McClellan came to his relief.But General Halleck had ordered him to hold Harper's Ferry to the last,
and Miles interpreted this order to mean that he must hold the town
itself.He therefore failed to occupy the heights around it in sufficient
strength and thus permitted himself to be caught in a trap.During the day of the 14th the Confederate artillery was dragged up the
mountain sides, and in the afternoon a heavy fire was opened on the doomed
Federal garrison.On that day McClellan received word from Miles that the
latter could hold out for two days longer and the commanding general sent
word: "Hold out to the last extremity.If it is possible, reoccupy the
Maryland Heights with your entire force.If you can do that I will
certainly be able to relieve you.... Hold out to the last."McClellan was
approaching slowly and felt confident he could relieve the place.On the morning of the 15th the roar of Confederate artillery again
resounded from hill to hill.From Loudon to Maryland Heights the firing
had begun and a little later the battle-flags of A. P. Hill rose on
Bolivar Heights.Scarcely two hours had the firing continued when Colonel
Miles raised the white flag at Harper's Ferry and its garrison of 12,500,
with vast military stores, passed into the hands of the Confederates.Colonel Miles was struck by a stray fragment of a Confederate shell which
gave him a mortal wound.The force of General Franklin, preparing to move
to the garrison's relief, on the morning of the 15th noted that firing at
the Ferry had ceased and suspected that the garrison had surrendered, as
it had.The Confederate Colonel Douglas, whose account of the surrender is both
absorbing and authoritative, thus describes the surrender in "Battles and
Leaders of the Civil War":

"Under instructions from General Jackson, I rode up the pike and into the
enemy's lines to ascertain the purpose of the white flag.Near the top of
the hill I met General White and staff and told him my mission.He replied
that Colonel Miles had been mortally wounded, that he was in command and
desired to have an interview with General Jackson.... I conducted them to
General Jackson, whom I found sitting on his horse where I had left
him.... The contrast in appearances there presented was striking.General
White, riding a handsome black horse, was carefully dressed and had on
untarnished gloves, boots, and sword.His staff were equally comely in
costume.On the other hand, General Jackson was the dingiest,
worst-dressed and worst-mounted general that a warrior who cared for good
looks and style would wish to surrender to."General Jackson... rode up to Bolivar and down into Harper's Ferry.The
curiosity in the Union army to see him was so great that the soldiers
lined the sides of the road.... One man had an echo of response all about
him when he said aloud: 'Boys, he's not much for looks, but if we'd had
him we wouldn't have been caught in this trap.'"McClellan had failed to reach Harper's Ferry in time to relieve it because
he was detained at South Mountain by a considerable portion of Lee's army
under D. H. Hill and Longstreet.McClellan had come into possession of
Lee's general order, outlining the campaign.Discovering by this order
that Lee had sent Jackson to attack Harper's Ferry he made every effort to
relieve it.The affair at Harper's Ferry, as that at South Mountain, was but a prelude
to the tremendous battle that was to follow two days later on the banks of
the little stream called Antietam Creek, in Maryland.When it was known
that Lee had led his army across the Potomac the people were filled with
consternation--the people, not only of the immediate vicinity, but of
Harrisburg, of Baltimore, of Philadelphia.Their fear was intensified by
the memory of the Second Bull Run of a few weeks earlier, and by the fact
that at this very time General Bragg was marching northward across
Kentucky with a great army, menacing Louisville and Cincinnati.As one year before, the hopes of the North had centered in George B.
McClellan, so it was now with the people of the East.They were ready to
forget his failure to capture Richmond in the early summer and to contrast
his partial successes on the Peninsula with the drastic defeat of his
successor at the Second Bull Run.When McClellan, therefore, passed through Maryland to the scene of the
coming battle, many of the people received him with joy and enthusiasm.At
Frederick City, he tells us in his "Own Story," he was "nearly overwhelmed
and pulled to pieces," and the people invited him into their houses and
gave him every demonstration of confidence.The first encounter, a double one, took place on September 14th, at two
passes of South Mountain, a continuation of the Blue Ridge, north of the
Potomac.General Franklin, who had been sent to relieve Harper's Ferry,
met a Confederate force at Crampton's Gap and defeated it in a sharp
battle of three hours' duration.Meanwhile, the First and Ninth Army
Corps, under Burnside, encountered a stronger force at Turner's Gap seven
miles farther up.The battle here continued many hours, till late in the
night, and the Union troops were victorious.Lee's loss was nearly twenty-seven hundred, of whom eight hundred were
prisoners.The Federals lost twenty-one hundred men and they failed to
save Harper's Ferry.Lee now placed Longstreet and D. H. Hill in a strong position near
Keedysville, but learning that McClellan was advancing rapidly, the
Confederate leader decided to retire to Sharpsburg, where he could be more
easily joined by Jackson.September 16th was a day of intense anxiety and
unrest in the valley of the Antietam.The people who had lived in the
farmhouses that dotted the golden autumn landscape in this hitherto quiet
community had now abandoned their homes and given place to the armed
forces.It was a day of marshaling and maneuvering of the gathering
thousands, preparatory to the mighty conflict that was clearly seen to be
inevitable.Lee had taken a strong position on the west bank of Antietam
Creek a few miles from where it flows into the Potomac.He made a display
of force, exposing his men to the fire of the Federal artillery, his
object being to await the coming of Jackson's command from Harper's Ferry.It is true that Jackson himself had arrived, but his men were weary with
marching and, moreover, a large portion of his troops under A. P. Hill and
McLaws had not yet reached the field.McClellan spent the day arranging his corps and giving directions for
planting batteries.With a few companions he rode along the whole front,
frequently drawing the fire of the Confederate batteries and thus
revealing their location.The right wing of his army, the corps of
Generals Hooker, Mansfield, and Sumner, lay to the north, near the village
of Keedysville.General Porter with two divisions of the Fifth Corps
occupied the center and Burnside was on the left of the Union lines.Back
of McClellan's lines was a ridge on which was a signal station commanding
a view of the entire field.Late on the afternoon of the 16th, Hooker
crossing the Antietam, advanced against Hood's division on the Confederate
left.For several hours there was heavy skirmishing, which closed with the
coming of darkness.The two great armies now lay facing each other in a grand double line
three miles in length.At one point (the Union right and the Confederate
left) they were so near together that the pickets could hear each other's
tread.It required no prophet to foretell what would happen on the morrow.Beautiful and clear the morning broke over the Maryland hills on the
fateful 17th of September, 1862.The sunlight had not yet crowned the
hilltops when artillery fire announced the opening of the battle.Hooker's
infantry soon entered into the action and encountered the Confederates in
an open field, from which the latter were presently pressed back across
the Hagerstown pike to a line of woods where they made a determined stand.Hooker then called on General Mansfield to come to his aid, and the latter
quickly did so, for he had led his corps across the Antietam after dark
the night before.Mansfield, however, a gallant and honored veteran, fell
mortally wounded while deploying his troops, and General Alpheus S.
Williams, at the head of his first division, succeeded to the command.There was a wood west of the Sharpsburg and Hagerstown turnpike which,
with its outcropping ledges of rock, formed an excellent retreat for the
Confederates and from this they pushed their columns into the open fields,
chiefly of corn, to meet the Union attacks.For about two hours the battle
raged at this point, the lines swaying to and fro, with fearful slaughter
on both sides.At length, General Greene, who commanded a division of the
fallen Mansfield's corps, gained possession of part of the coveted forest,
near a little white church, known as the Dunker's Chapel.This was on high
ground and was the key to the Confederate left wing.But Greene's troops
were exposed to a galling fire from D. H. Hill's division and he called
for reenforcements.General Sumner then sent Sedgwick's division across the stream and
accompanied the troops to the aid of their hard-pressed comrades.And the
experience of this body of the gallant Second Corps during the next hour
was probably the most thrilling episode of the whole day's battle.Sedgwick's troops advanced straight toward the conflict.They found Hooker
wounded and his and Williams' troops quite exhausted.A sharp artillery
fire was turned on Sedgwick before he reached the woods west of the
Hagerstown pike, but once in the shelter of the thick trees he passed in
safety to the western edge.Heavy Confederate reenforcements--ten brigades, in fact--Walker's men, and
McLaws', having arrived from Harper's Ferry--were hastening up, and they
not only blocked the front, but worked around to the rear of Sedgwick's
isolated brigades.Sedgwick was wounded in the awful slaughter that
followed, but he and Sumner finally extricated their men with a loss of
two thousand, over three hundred left dead on the ghastly field.Franklin
now sent forward some fresh troops and after obstinately fighting, the
Federals finally held a cornfield and most of the coveted wood over which
the conflict had raged till the ground was saturated with blood.Before the close of this bloody conflict on the Union right another,
almost if not quite as deadly, was in progress near the center.General
French, soon joined by General Richardson, both of Sumner's corps, crossed
the stream and made a desperate assault against the Southerners of D. H.
Hill's division, stationed to the south of where the battle had previously
raged--French on a line of heights strongly held by the Confederates,
Richardson in the direction of a sunken road, since known as "Bloody
Lane."The fighting here was of a most desperate character and continued
nearly four hours.French captured a few flags, several hundred prisoners,
and gained some ground, but he failed to carry the heights.Richardson was
mortally wounded while leading a charge and was succeeded by General
Hancock; but his men finally captured Bloody Lane with the three hundred
living men who had remained to defend it.The final Federal charge at this
point was made by Colonel Barlow, who displayed the utmost bravery and
self-possession in the thickest of the fight, where he won a
brigadier-generalship.He was wounded, and later carried off the field.The Confederates had fought desperately to hold their position in Bloody
Lane, and when it was captured it was filled with dead bodies.It was now
about one o'clock and the infantry firing ceased for the day on the Union
right, and center.Let us now look on the other part of the field.Burnside held the Federal
left wing against Lee's right, and he remained inactive for some hours
after the battle had begun at the other end of the line.In front of
Burnside was a triple-arched stone bridge across the Antietam, since known
as "Burnside's Bridge."Opposite this bridge, on the <DW72> which extends
to a high ridge, were Confederate breastworks and rifle-pits, which
commanded the bridge with a direct or enfilading fire.While the Federal
right was fighting on the morning of the 17th, McClellan sent an order to
Burnside to advance on the bridge, to take possession of it and cross the
stream by means of it.It must have been about ten o'clock when Burnside
received the order as McClellan was more than two miles away.Burnside's chief officer at this moment was General Jacob D. Cox
(afterward Governor of Ohio), who had succeeded General Reno, killed at
South Mountain.On Cox fell the task of capturing the stone bridge.The
defense of the bridge was in the hands of General Robert Toombs, a former
United States senator and a member of Jefferson Davis' Cabinet.Perhaps
the most notable single event in the life of General Toombs was his
holding of the Burnside Bridge at Antietam for three hours against the
assaults of the Federal troops.The Confederates had been weakened at this
point by the sending of Walker to the support of Jackson, where, as we
have noticed, he took part in the deadly assault upon Sedgwick's division.Toombs, therefore, with his one brigade had a heavy task before him in
defending the bridge with his small force, notwithstanding his advantage
of position.McClellan sent several urgent orders to advance at all hazards.Burnside
forwarded these to Cox, and in the fear that the latter would be unable to
carry the bridge by a direct front attack, he sent Rodman with a division
to cross the creek by a ford some distance below.Meanwhile, in rapid succession, one assault after
another was made upon the bridge and, about one o'clock, it was carried,
at the cost of five hundred men.A lull in the
fighting along the whole line of battle now ensued.Burnside, however, received another order from McClellan to push on up the
heights and to the village of Sharpsburg.The great importance of this
move, if successful, was that it would cut Lee out from his line of
retreat by way of Shepherdstown.After replenishing the ammunition and adding some fresh troops, Cox
advanced at three o'clock with the utmost gallantry toward Sharpsburg.The
Confederates disputed the ground with great bravery.But Cox swept all
before him and was at the edge of the village when he was suddenly
confronted by lines in blue uniforms who instantly opened fire.The
Federals were astonished to see the blue-clad battalions before them.They
must be Union soldiers; but how did they get there?They were A. P. Hill's division of Lee's army which had just
arrived from Harper's Ferry, and they had dressed themselves in the
uniforms that they had taken from the Federal stores.Hill had come just in time to save Lee's headquarters from capture.He
checked Cox's advance, threw a portion of the troops into great confusion,
and steadily pressed them back toward the Antietam.In this, the end of
the battle, General Rodman fell mortally wounded.Cox retired in good
order and Sharpsburg remained in the hands of the Confederates.Thus, with the approach of nightfall, closed the memorable battle of
Antietam.For fourteen long hours more than one hundred thousand men, with
five hundred pieces of artillery, had engaged in titanic combat.As the
pall of battle smoke rose and cleared away, the scene presented was one to
make the stoutest heart shudder.There lay upon the ground, scattered for
three miles over the valleys and the hills or in the improvised hospitals,
more than twenty thousand men.Horace Greeley was probably right in
pronouncing this the bloodiest day in American history.Although tactically it was a drawn battle, Antietam was decisively in
favor of the North inasmuch as it ended the first Confederate attempt at a
Northern invasion.General Lee realized that his ulterior plans had been
thwarted by this engagement and after a consultation with his corps
commanders he determined to withdraw from Maryland.On the night of the
18th the retreat began and early the next morning the Confederate army had
all safely recrossed the Potomac.The great mistake of the Maryland campaign from the standpoint of the
Confederate forces, thought General Longstreet, was the division of Lee's
army, and he believed that if Lee had kept his forces together he would
not have been forced to abandon the campaign.At Antietam, he had less
than forty thousand men, who were in poor condition for battle while
McClellan had about eighty-seven thousand, most of whom were fresh and
strong, though not more than sixty thousand were in action.The moral effect of the battle of Antietam was incalculably great.It
aroused the confidence of the Northern people.It emboldened President
Lincoln to issue five days after its close the proclamation freeing the
slaves in the seceded states.He had written the proclamation long before,
but it had lain inactive in his desk at Washington.All through the
struggles of the summer of 1862 he had looked forward to the time when he
could announce his decision to the people.With the doubtful success of Federal arms, to make such a bold step would
have been a mockery and would have defeated the very end he sought.The South had now struck its first desperate blow at the gateways to the
North.By daring, almost unparalleled in warfare, it had swung its
courageous army into a strategical position where with the stroke of
fortune it might have hammered down the defenses of the National capital
on the south and then sweep on a march of invasion into the North.The
Northern soldiers had parried the blow.They had saved themselves from
disaster and had held back the tide of the Confederacy as it beat against
the Mason and Dixon line, forcing it back into the State of Virginia where
the two mighty fighting bodies were soon to meet again in a desperate
struggle for the right-of-way at Fredericksburg.[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS

ACCORDING TO HIS WIDOW THE ONLY WAR-TIME PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE CONFEDERACY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Thus appeared Jefferson Davis, who on the eve of Antietam was facing one
of the gravest crises of his career.Eighteen months previously, on
February 9, 1861, he had been unanimously elected president of the
Confederate States of America.He maintained
that the secession of the Southern states should be regarded as a purely
peaceful move.But events had swiftly drawn him and his government into
the most stupendous civil conflict of modern times.Now, in September,
1862, he was awaiting the decision of fate.The Southern forces had
advanced northward triumphantly.Elated by success, they were at this
moment invading the territory of the enemy under the leadership of Lee,
whose victories had everywhere inspired not only confidence but enthusiasm
and devotion.Should he overthrow the Northern armies, the Confederacy
would be recognized abroad and its independence probably established at
home.Should he be defeated, no one could foretell the result.From this time the fortunes of the Confederacy waned.[Illustration: LEE LOCKS THE GATES

COPYRIGHT 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Sharpsburg, Maryland, September 17, 1862.There were long minutes on that
sunny day in the early fall of 1862 when Robert E. Lee, at his
headquarters west of Sharpsburg, must have been in almost entire ignorance
of how the battle went.Outnumbered he knew his troops were; outfought he
knew they never would be.Longstreet, Hood, D. H. Hill, Evans, and D. R.
Jones had turned back more than one charge in the morning; but, as the day
wore on, Lee perceived that the center must be held.He had deceived McClellan as to his numerical strength and he must
continue to do so.At one time
General Longstreet reported from the center to General Chilton, Lee's
Chief of Staff, that Cooke's North Carolina regiment--still keeping its
colors at the front--had not a cartridge left.None but veteran troops
could hold a line like this, supported by only two guns of Miller's
battery of the Washington Artillery.Of this crisis in the battle General
Longstreet wrote afterward: "We were already badly whipped and were
holding our ground by sheer force of desperation."Actually in line that
day on the Confederate side were only 37,000 men, and opposed to them were
numbers that could be footed up to 50,000 more.At what time in the day
General Lee must have perceived that the invasion of Maryland must come to
an end cannot be told.He had lost 20,000 of his tired, footsore army by
straggling on the march, according to the report of Longstreet, who adds:
"Nearly one-fourth of the troops who went into the battle were killed or
wounded."At dark Lee's rearward movement had begun.[Illustration: A REGIMENT THAT FOUGHT AT SOUTH MOUNTAIN--THE THIRTY-FIFTH

Early in the morning of September 17, 1862, Knap's battery (shown below)
got into the thick of the action of Antietam.General Mansfield had posted
it opposite the north end of the West Woods, close to the Confederate
line.The guns opened fire at seven o'clock.Practically unsupported, the
battery was twice charged upon during the morning; but quickly
substituting canister for shot and shell, the men held their ground and
stemmed the Confederate advance.Near this spot General Mansfield was
mortally wounded while deploying his troops.About noon a section of
Knap's battery was detached to the assistance of General Greene, in the
East Woods.[Illustration: KNAP'S BATTERY, JUST AFTER THE BLOODY WORK AT ANTIETAM

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.This photograph was taken back of the rail fence on the Hagerstown pike,
where "Stonewall" Jackson's men attempted to rally in the face of Hooker's
ferocious charge that opened the bloodiest day of the Civil War--September
17, 1862.Hooker, advancing to seize high ground nearly three-quarters of
a mile distant, had not gone far before the glint of the rising sun
disclosed the bayonet-points of a large Confederate force standing in a
cornfield in his immediate front.This was a part of Jackson's Corps which
had arrived during the morning of the 16th from the capture of Harper's
Ferry and had been posted in this position to surprise Hooker in his
advance.The outcome was a terrible surprise to the Confederates.All of
Hooker's batteries hurried into action and opened with canister on the
cornfield.The Confederates stood bravely up against this fire, and as
Hooker's men advanced they made a determined resistance.Back and still
farther back were Jackson's men driven across the open field, every stalk
of corn in which was cut down by the battle as closely as a knife could
have done it.On the ground the slain lay in rows precisely as they had
stood in ranks.From the cornfield into a small patch of woods (the West
Woods) the Confederates were driven, leaving the sad result of the
surprise behind them.As the edge of the woods was approached by Hooker's
men the resistance became stronger and more stubborn.Nearly all the units
of two of Jackson's divisions were now in action, and cavalry and
artillery were aiding them."The two lines," says General Palfrey, "almost
tore each other to pieces."General Starke and Colonel Douglas on the
Confederate side were killed.More than half of Lawton's and Hays'
brigades were either killed or wounded.On the Federal side General
Ricketts lost a third of his division.The energy of both forces was
entirely spent and reinforcements were necessary before the battle could
be continued.Many of Jackson's men wore trousers and caps of Federal
blue, as did most of the troops which had been engaged with Jackson in the
affair at Harper's Ferry.A. P. Hill's men, arriving from Harper's Ferry
that same afternoon, were dressed in new Federal uniforms--a part of their
booty--and at first were mistaken for Federals by the friends who were
anxiously awaiting them.[Illustration: THE THRICE-FOUGHT GROUND

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The field beyond the leveled fence is covered with both Federal and
Confederate dead.Over this open space swept Sedgwick's division of
Sumner's Second Corps, after passing through the East and entering the
West Woods.This is near where the Confederate General Ewell's division,
reenforced by McLaws and Walker, fell upon Sedgwick's left flank and rear.Nearly two thousand Federal soldiers were struck down, the division losing
during the day more than forty per cent.One
regiment lost sixty per cent.--the highest regimental loss sustained.Later the right of the Confederate line crossed the turnpike at the Dunker
church (about half a mile to the left of the picture) and made two
assaults upon Greene, but they were repulsed with great slaughter.General
D. R. Jones, of Jackson's division, had been wounded.The brave Starke who
succeeded him was killed; and Lawton, who followed Starke, had fallen
wounded.[Illustration: RUIN OF MUMMA'S HOUSE, ANTIETAM]

A flaming mansion was the guidon for the extreme left of Greene's division
when (early in the morning) he had moved forward along the ridge leading
to the East Woods.This dwelling belonged to a planter by the name of
Mumma.It stood in the very center of the Federal advance, and also at the
extreme left of D. H. Hill's line.The house had been fired by the
Confederates, who feared that its thick walls might become a vantage-point
for the Federal infantry.It burned throughout the battle, the flames
subsiding only in the afternoon.Before it, just across the road, a
battery of the First Rhode Island Light Artillery had placed its guns.Twice were they charged, but each time they were repulsed.From Mumma's
house it was less than half a mile across the open field to the Dunker
church.The fence-rails in the upper picture were those of the field
enclosing Mumma's land, and the heroic dead pictured lying there were in
full sight from the burning mansion.[Illustration: THE HARVEST OF "BLOODY LANE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here, at "Bloody Lane" in the sunken road, was delivered the most telling
blow of which the Federals could boast in the day's fighting at Antietam,
September 17, 1862.In the lower picture we see the officers whose work
first began to turn the tide of battle into a decisive advantage which the
Army of the Potomac had every reason to expect would be gained by its
superior numbers.On the Federal right Jackson, with a bare four thousand
men, had taken the fight out of Hooker's eighteen thousand in the morning,
giving ground at last to Sumner's fresh troops.On the Federal left,
Burnside (at the lower bridge) failed to advance against Longstreet's
Corps, two-thirds of which had been detached for service elsewhere.It was
at the center that the forces of French and Richardson, skilfully fought
by their leaders, broke through the Confederate lines and, sweeping beyond
the sunken road, seized the very citadel of the center.Meagher's Irish
Brigade had fought its way to a crest from which a plunging fire could be
poured upon the Confederates in the sunken road.Meagher's ammunition was
exhausted, and Caldwell threw his force into the position and continued
the terrible combat.When the Confederates executed their flanking
movement to the left, Colonel D. R. Cross, of the Fifth New Hampshire,
seized a position which exposed Hill's men to an enfilading fire.(In the

[Illustration: SHERRICK'S HOUSE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In three distinct localities the battle waxed fierce from dawn to dusk on
that terrible day at Antietam, September 17, 1862.First at the Federal
right around the Dunker church; then at the sunken road, where the centers
of both armies spent themselves in sanguinary struggle; lastly, late in
the day, the struggle was renewed and ceased on the Sharpsburg road.When
Burnside finally got his troops in motion, Sturgis' division of the Ninth
Corps was first to cross the creek; his men advanced through an open
ravine under a withering fire till they gained the opposite crest and held
it until reenforced by Wilcox.To their right ran the Sharpsburg road, and
an advance was begun in the direction of the Sherrick house.[Illustration: GENERAL A. P. HILL, C. S.The fighting along the Sharpsburg road might have resulted in a
Confederate disaster had it not been for the timely arrival of the troops
of General A. P. Hill.His six brigades of Confederate veterans had been
the last to leave Harper's Ferry, remaining behind Jackson's main body in
order to attend to the details of the surrender.Just as the Federal Ninth
Corps was in the height of its advance, a cloud of dust on Harper's Ferry
road cheered the Confederates to redoubled effort.Out of the dust the
brigades of Hill debouched upon the field.Their fighting blood seemed to
have but mounted more strongly during their march of eighteen miles.Without waiting for orders, Hill threw his men into the fight and the
progress of the Ninth Corps was stopped.Lee had counted on the arrival of
Hill in time to prevent any successful attempt upon the Confederate right
held by Longstreet's Corps, two-thirds of which had been detached in the
thick of the fighting of the morning, when Lee's left and center suffered
so severely.Burnside's delay at the bridge could not have been more
fortunate for Lee if he had fixed its duration himself.Had the
Confederate left been attacked at the time appointed, the outcome of
Antietam could scarcely have been other than a decisive victory for the
Federals.Even at the time when Burnside's tardy advance began, it must
have prevailed against the weakened and wearied Confederates had not the
fresh troops of A. P. Hill averted the disaster.[Illustration: AFTER THE ADVANCE]

In the advance along the Sharpsburg road near the Sherrick house the 79th
New York "Highlanders" deployed as skirmishers.From orchards and
cornfields and from behind fences and haystacks the Confederate
sharpshooters opened upon them, but they swept on, driving in a part of
Jones' division and capturing a battery just before A. P. Hill's troops
arrived.With these reenforcements the Confederates drove back the brave
Highlanders from the suburbs of Sharpsburg, which they had reached.Stubborn Scotch blood would permit only a reluctant retreat.Sharp
fighting occurred around the Sherrick house with results seen in the lower
picture.[Illustration: THE SEVENTEENTH NEW YORK ARTILLERY DRILLING BEFORE THE

Confederates were about to descend upon Washington.This battery of six
guns, the one on the right hand, pointing directly out of the picture,

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]President Lincoln's Visit to the Camps at Antietam, October 8, 1862.Yearning for the speedy termination of the war, Lincoln came to view the
Army of the Potomac, as he had done at Harrison's Landing.Puzzled to
understand how Lee could have circumvented a superior force on the
Peninsula, he was now anxious to learn why a crushing blow had not been
struck.Lincoln (after Gettysburg) expressed the same thought: "Our army
held the war in the hollow of their hand and they would not close it!"On
Lincoln's right stands Allan Pinkerton, the famous detective and organizer
of the Secret Service of the army.At the President's left is General John
A. McClernand, soon to be entrusted by Lincoln with reorganizing military
operations in the West.STONE'S RIVER, OR MURFREESBORO

    As it is, the battle of Stone's River seems less clearly a Federal
    victory than the battle of Shiloh.The latter decided the fall of
    Corinth; the former did not decide the fall of Chattanooga.Offensively it was a drawn battle, as looked at from either side.As a
    defensive battle, however, it was clearly a Union victory.--_John
    Fiske in "The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War."_


The battle of Corinth developed a man--William S. Rosecrans--whose
singular skill in planning the battle, and whose dauntless courage in
riding between the firing-lines at the opportune moment, drew the
country's attention almost as fully as Grant had done at Fort Donelson.And at this particular moment the West needed, or thought it needed, a
man.The autumn months of 1862 had been spent by Generals Bragg and Buell
in an exciting race across Kentucky, each at the head of a great army.Buell had saved Louisville from the legions of Bragg, and he had driven
the Confederate Army of the Mississippi from the State; but he had not
prevented his opponent from carrying away a vast amount of plunder, nor
had he won decisive results at the battle of Perryville, which took place
October 8, 1862, four days after the battle of Corinth.Thereupon the
Federal authorities decided to relieve Buell of the Army of the Ohio and
to give it to General Rosecrans.On October 30, 1862, Rosecrans assumed command at Nashville of this force,
which was now designated as the Army of the Cumberland.Bragg had
concentrated his army at Murfreesboro, in central Tennessee, about thirty
miles southeast of Nashville and a mile east of a little tributary of the
Cumberland River called Stone's River.Here occurred, two months later,
the bloodiest single day's battle in the West, a conflict imminent as
soon as the news came (on December 26th) that the Federals were advancing
from Nashville.General Bragg did not lose a moment in marshaling his army into well-drawn
battle-lines.His army was in two corps with a cavalry division under
General Wheeler, Forrest and Morgan being on detached service.The left
wing, under General Hardee, and the center, under Polk, were sent across
Stone's River, the right wing, a division under John C. Breckinridge,
remaining on the eastern side of the stream to guard the town.The line
was three miles in length, and on December 30th the Federal host that had
come from Nashville stood opposite, in a parallel line.The left wing, opposite Breckinridge, was commanded by
Thomas L. Crittenden, whose brother was a commander in the Confederacy.They were sons of the famous United States senator from Kentucky, John J.
Crittenden.The Federal center, opposite Polk, was commanded by George H.
Thomas, and the right wing, opposing the Confederate left, was led by
Alexander McD.McCook, one of the well-known "Fighting McCook" brothers.The effective Federal force was about forty-three thousand men; the
Confederate army numbered about thirty-eight thousand.That night they
bivouacked within musket range of each other and the camp-fires of each
were clearly seen by the other as they shone through the cedar groves that
interposed.Thus lay the two great armies, ready to spring upon each other
in deadly combat with the coming of the morning.Rosecrans had permitted McCook to thin out his lines over too much space,
while on that very part of the field Bragg had concentrated his forces for
the heaviest attack.The plans of battle made by the two opposing
commanders were strikingly similar.Rosecrans' plan was to throw his left
wing, under Crittenden, across the river upon the Confederate right under
Breckinridge, to crush it in one impetuous dash, and to swing around
through Murfreesboro to the Franklin road and cut off the Confederate
line of retreat.Bragg, on the other hand, intended to make a similar dash
upon the Union right, pivot upon his center, press back McCook upon that
center, crumpling the Federals and seizing the Nashville turnpike to cut
off Rosecrans' retreat toward Nashville.Neither, of course, knew of the
other's plan, and much would depend on who would strike first.At the early light of the last day of the year the Confederate left wing
moved upon the Union right in a magnificent battle-line, three-quarters of
a mile in length and two columns deep.At the same time the Confederate
artillery opened with their cannon.McCook was astonished at so fierce and
sudden a charge.The gallant Patrick Cleburne, one of the ablest
commanders in the Southern armies, led his division, which had been
brought from the Confederate right, in the charge.The Federal lines were
ill prepared for this sudden onslaught, and before McCook could arrange
them several batteries were overpowered and eleven of the heavy guns were
in the hands of the Confederates.Slowly the Union troops fell back, firing as they went; but they had no
power to check the impetuous, overwhelming charge of the onrushing foe.McCook's two right divisions, under Johnson and Jeff.C. Davis, were
driven back, but his third division, which was commanded by a young
officer who had attracted unusual attention at the battle of
Perryville--Philip H. Sheridan--held its ground.At the first Confederate
advance, Sill's brigade of Sheridan's division drove the troops in front
of it back into their entrenchments, and in the charge the brave Sill lost
his life.While the battle raged with tremendous fury on the Union right, Rosecrans
was three miles away, throwing his left across the river.Hearing the
terrific roar of battle at the other end of the line, Rosecrans hastened
to begin his attack on Breckinridge hoping to draw a portion of the
Confederate force away from McCook.But as the hours of the forenoon
passed he was dismayed as he noted that the sound of battle was coming
nearer, and he rightly divined that his right wing was receding before the
dashing soldiers of the South.He ordered McCook to dispute every inch of
the ground; but McCook's command was soon torn to pieces and disorganized,
except the division of Sheridan.The latter stood firm against the overwhelming numbers, a stand that
attracted the attention of the country and brought him military fame.He
checked the onrushing Confederates at the point of the bayonet; he formed
a new line under fire.In his first position Sheridan held his ground for
two hours.The Confederate attack had also fallen heavily on Negley, who
was stationed on Sheridan's left, and on Palmer, both of Thomas' center.Rousseau commanding the reserves, and Van Cleve of Crittenden's forces
were ordered to the support of the Union center and right.Here, for two
hours longer the battle raged with unabated fury, and the slaughter of
brave men on both sides was appalling.Three times the whole Confederate
left and center were thrown against the Union divisions, but failed to
break the lines.At length when their cartridge boxes were empty
Sheridan's men could do nothing but retire for more ammunition, and they
did this in good order to a rolling plain near the Nashville road.But
Rousseau of Thomas' center was there to check the Confederate advance.It was now past noon, and still the battle roar resounded unceasingly
through the woods and hills about Murfreesboro.Though both hosts had
struggled and suffered since early morning, they still held to their guns,
pouring withering volleys into each other's ranks.The Federal right and
center had been forced back at right angles to the position they had held
when day dawned; and the Confederate left was swung around at right angles
to its position of the morning.The Federal left rested on Stone's River,
while Bragg's right was on the same stream and close to the line in blue.Meantime, Rosecrans had massed his artillery on a little hill overlooking
the field of action.He had also re-formed the broken lines of the right
and center and called in twelve thousand fresh troops.Then, after a brief
lull, the battle opened again and the ranks of both sides were torn with
grape and canister and bursting shells.In answer to Bragg's call for reenforcements came Breckinridge with all
but one brigade of his division, a host of about seven thousand fresh
troops.The new Confederate attack began slowly, but increased its speed
at every step.Suddenly, a thundering volley burst from the line in blue,
and the front ranks of the attacking column disappeared.Again, a volley
tore through the ranks in gray, and the assault was abandoned.The battle had raged for nearly eleven hours, when night enveloped the
scene, and the firing abated slowly and died away.It had been a bloody
day--this first day's fight at Stone's River--and except at Antietam it
had not thus far been surpassed in the war.The advantage was clearly with
the Confederates.They had pressed back the Federals for two miles, had
routed their right wing and captured many prisoners and twenty-eight heavy
guns.But Rosecrans determined to hold his ground and try again.The next day was New Year's and but for a stray fusillade, here and there,
both armies remained inactive, except that each quietly prepared to renew
the contest on the morrow.The renewal of the battle on January 2nd was
fully expected on both sides, but there was little fighting till four in
the afternoon.Rosecrans had sent General Van Cleve's division on January
1st across the river to seize an elevation from which he could shell the
town of Murfreesboro.Bragg now sent Breckinridge to dislodge the
division, and he did so with splendid effect.But Breckinridge's men came
into such a position as to be exposed to the raking fire of fifty-two
pieces of Federal artillery on the west side of the river.Returning the
deadly and constant fire as best they could, they stood the storm of shot
and shell for half an hour when they retreated to a place of safety,
leaving seventeen hundred of their number dead or wounded on the field.That night the two armies again lay within musket shot of each other.The
next day brought no further conflict and during that night General Bragg
moved away to winter quarters at Shelbyville, on the Elk River.Murfreesboro, or Stone's River, was one of the great battles of the war.The losses were about thirteen thousand to the Federals and over ten
thousand to the Confederates.Both sides claimed victory--the South
because of Bragg's signal success on the first day; the North because of
Breckinridge's fearful repulse at the final onset and of Bragg's
retreating in the night and refusing to fight again.A portion of the
Confederate army occupied Shelbyville, Tennessee, and the larger part
entrenched at Tullahoma, eighteen miles to the southeast.Six months after the battle of Stone's River, the Federal army suddenly
awoke from its somnolent condition--a winter and spring spent in raids and
unimportant skirmishes--and became very busy preparing for a long and
hasty march.Rosecrans' plan of campaign was brilliant and proved most
effective.He realized that Tullahoma was the barrier to Chattanooga, and
determined to drive the Confederates from it.On June 23, 1863, the advance began.The cavalry, under General Stanley,
had received orders to advance upon Shelbyville on the 24th, and during
that night to build immense and numerous camp-fires before the Confederate
stronghold at Shelbyville, to create the impression that Rosecrans' entire
army was massing at that point.But the wily leader of the Federals had
other plans, and when Stanley, supported by General Granger, had built his
fires, the larger force was closing in upon Tullahoma.The stratagem dawned upon Bragg too late to check Rosecrans' plans.Stanley and Granger made a brilliant capture of Shelbyville, and Bragg
retired to Tullahoma; but finding here that every disposition had been
made to fall upon his rear, he continued his southward retreat toward
Chattanooga.[Illustration: MEN WHO LEARNED WAR WITH SHERMAN

FREDERICKSBURG--DISASTER FOR A NEW UNION LEADER

    The Army of the Potomac had fought gallantly; it had not lost a single
    cannon, all its attacks being made by masses of infantry; it had
    experienced neither disorder nor rout.But the defeat was complete,
    and its effects were felt throughout the entire country as keenly as
    in the ranks of the army.The little confidence that Burnside had been
    able to inspire in his soldiers had vanished, and the respect which
    everybody entertained for the noble character of the unfortunate
    general could not supply its place.--_Comte de Paris, in "History of
    the Civil War in America."_


The silent city of military graves at Fredericksburg is a memorial of one
of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War.The battle of Antietam had been
regarded a victory by the Federals and a source of hope to the North,
after a wearisome period of inaction and defeats.General George B.
McClellan, in command of the Army of the Potomac, failed to follow up this
advantage and strike fast and hard while the Southern army was shattered
and weak.President Lincoln's impatience was brought to a climax;
McClellan was relieved and succeeded by General Ambrose E. Burnside, who
was looked upon with favor by the President, and who had twice declined
this proffered honor.It was on November 5, 1862, nearly two months after
Antietam, when this order was issued.The Army of the Potomac was in
splendid form and had made plans for a vigorous campaign.On the 9th
Burnside assumed command, and on the following day McClellan took leave of
his beloved troops.Burnside at once changed the whole plan of campaign, and decided to move
on Fredericksburg, which lay between the Union and Confederate armies.He
organized his army into three grand divisions, under Generals Sumner,
Hooker, and Franklin, commanding the right, center, and left, and moved
his troops from Warrenton to Falmouth.A delay of some two weeks was due
to the failure of arrival of the pontoons.In a council of war held on the
night of December 10th the officers under Burnside expressed themselves
almost unanimously as opposed to the plan of battle, but Burnside
disregarded their views and determined to carry out his original plans
immediately.After some delay and desultory fighting for two days, the
crossing of the army was effected by the morning of December 13th.By this
time General Robert E. Lee, commanding the Confederates, had his army
concentrated and entrenched on the hills surrounding the town.In their
efforts to place their bridges the Federals were seriously hindered by the
firing of the Confederate sharpshooters--"hornets that were stinging the
Army of the Potomac into a frenzy."The Confederate fire continued until
silenced by a heavy bombardment of the city from the Federal guns, when
the crossing of the army into Fredericksburg was completed without further
interference.The forces of Lee were in battle array about the town.Their line
stretched for five miles along the range of hills which spread in crescent
shape around the lowland where the city lay, surrounding it on all sides
save the east, where the river flowed.The strongest Confederate position
was on the <DW72>s of the lowest hill of the range, Marye's Heights, which
rose in the rear of the town.Along the foot of this hill there was a
stone wall, about four feet in height, bounding the eastern side of the
Telegraph road, which at this point runs north and south, being depressed
a few feet below the surface of the stone wall, thus forming a breastwork
for the Confederate troops.Behind it a strong force was concealed, while
higher up, in several ranks, the main army was massed, stretching along
the line of hills.The right wing, consisting of thirty thousand troops on
an elevation near Hamilton's Crossing of the Fredericksburg and Potomac
Railroad, was commanded by "Stonewall" Jackson.The left, on Marye's
Heights and Marye's Hill, was commanded by the redoubtable Longstreet.The
Southern forces numbered about seventy-eight thousand.Into the little city below and the adjoining valleys, the Federal troops
had been marching for two days.Franklin's Left Grand Division of forty
thousand was strengthened by two divisions from Hooker's Center Grand
Division, and was ordered to make the first attack on the Confederate
right under Jackson.Sumner's Right Grand Division, also reenforced from
Hooker's forces, was formed for assault against the Confederate's
strongest point at Marye's Hill.All this magnificent and portentous battle formation had been effected
under cover of a dense fog, and when it lifted on that fateful Saturday
there was revealed a scene of truly military grandeur.Concealed by the
somber curtain of nature the Southern hosts had fixed their batteries and
entrenched themselves most advantageously upon the hills, and the Union
legions, massed in menacing strength below, now lay within easy
cannon-shot of their foe.The Union army totaled one hundred and thirteen
thousand men.After skirmishing and gathering of strength, it was at
length ready for the final spring and the death-grapple.When the sun's rays broke through the fog during the forenoon of December
13th, Franklin's Grand Division was revealed in full strength in front of
the Confederate right, marching and countermarching in preparation for the
coming conflict.Officers in new, bright uniforms, thousands of bayonets
gleaming in the sunshine, champing steeds, rattling gun-carriages whisking
artillery into proper range of the foe, infantry, cavalry, batteries, with
officers and men, formed a scene of magnificent grandeur which excited the
admiration even of the Confederates.This maneuver has been called the
grandest military scene of the war.Yet with all this brave show, we have seen that Burnside's subordinate
officers were unanimous in their belief in the rashness of the
undertaking.The English military writer,
Colonel Henderson, has explained why this was so:

    And yet that vast array, so formidable of aspect, lacked that moral
    force without which physical power, even in its most terrible form, is
    but an idle show.Not only were the strength of the Confederate
    position, the want of energy of preliminary movements, the insecurity
    of their own situation, but too apparent to the intelligence of the
    regimental officers and men, but they mistrusted their commander.Northern writers have recorded that the Army of the Potomac never went
    down to battle with less alacrity than on this day at Fredericksburg.The first advance began at 8:30 in the morning, while the fog was still
dense, upon Jackson's right.Reynolds ordered Meade with a division,
supported by two other divisions under Doubleday and Gibbon, to attack
Jackson at his weakest point, the extreme right of the Confederate lines,
and endeavor to seize one of the opposing heights.The advance was made in
three lines of battle, which were guarded in front and on each flank by
artillery which swept the field in front as the army advanced.The
Confederates were placed to have an enfilading sweep from both flanks
along the entire front line of march.When Reynolds' divisions had
approached within range, Jackson's small arms on the left poured in a
deadly fire, mowing down the brave men in the Union lines in swaths,
leaving broad gaps where men had stood.This fire was repeated again and again, as the Federals pressed on, only
to be repulsed.Once only was the Confederate line broken, when Meade
carried the crest, capturing flags and prisoners.The ground lost by the
Confederates was soon recovered, and the Federals were forced to retire.Some of the charges made by the Federals during this engagement were
heroic in the extreme, only equaled by the opposition met from the foe.In one advance, knapsacks were unslung and bayonets fixed; a brigade
marched across a plowed field, and passed through broken lines of other
brigades, which were retiring to the rear in confusion from the leaden
storm.The fire became incessant and destructive; many fell, killed or wounded;
the front line slackened its pace, and without orders commenced firing.A
halt seemed imminent, and a halt in the face of the terrific fire to which
the men were exposed meant death; but, urged on by regimental commanders
in person, the charge was renewed, when with a shout they leaped the
ditches, charged across the railroad, and upon the foe, killing many with
the bayonet and capturing several hundred prisoners.But this was only a
temporary gain.In every instance the Federals were shattered and driven
back.Men were lying dead in heaps, the wounded and dying were groaning in
agony.Soldiers were fleeing; officers were galloping to and fro urging
their lines forward, and begging their superior officers for assistance
and reenforcement.A dispatch to Burnside from Franklin, dated 2:45, was as follows: "My left
has been very badly handled; what hope is there of getting reenforcements
across the river?"Another dispatch, dated 3:45, read: "Our troops have
gained no ground in the last half hour."In their retreat the fire was almost as destructive as during the assault.Most of the wounded were brought from the field after this engagement, but
the dead were left where they fell.It was during this engagement that
General George D. Bayard was mortally wounded by a shot which had severed
the sword belt of Captain Gibson, leaving him uninjured.The knapsack of a
soldier who was in a stooping posture was struck by a ball, and a deck of
cards was sent flying twenty feet in the air.Those witnessing the
ludicrous scene called to him, "Oh, deal me a hand!"thus indicating the
spirit of levity among soldiers even amid such surroundings.Another
soldier sitting on the ground suddenly leaped high above the heads of his
comrades as a shell struck the spot, scooping a wheelbarrowful of earth,
but the man was untouched.Entirely independent of the action in which the Left Grand Division under
Franklin was engaged against the right wing of the Confederate line,
Sumner's Right Grand Division was engaged in a terrific assault upon the
works on Marye's Heights, the stronghold of the Confederate forces.Their
position was almost impregnable, consisting of earthworks, wood, and stone
barricades running along the sunken road near the foot of Marye's Hill.The Federals were not aware of the sunken road, nor of the force of
twenty-five hundred under General Cobb concealed behind the stone wall,
this wall not being new work as a part of the entrenchments, but of
earlier construction.When the advance up the road was made they were
harassed by shot and shell and rifle-balls at every step, but the men came
dashing into line undismayed by the terrific fire which poured down upon
them.The Irish Brigade, the second of Hancock's division, under General
Meagher, made a wonderful charge.When they returned from the assault but
two hundred and fifty out of twelve hundred men reported under arms from
the field, and all these were needed to care for their wounded comrades.The One Hundred and Sixteenth Pennsylvania regiment was new on the field
of battle, but did fearless and heroic service.The approach was
completely commanded by the Confederate guns.Repeatedly the advance was
repulsed by well-directed fire from the batteries.Once again Sumner's gallant men charged across a railroad cut, running
down one side and up the other, and still again attempted to escape in the
same manner, but each time they were forced to retire precipitately by a
murderous fire from the Confederate batteries.Not only was the
Confederate fire disastrous upon the approach and the successive repulses
by the foe, but it also inflicted great damage upon the masses of the
Federal army in front of Marye's Hill.The Confederates' effective and
successful work on Marye's Hill in this battle was not alone due to the
natural strength of their position, but also to the skill and generalship
of the leaders, and to the gallantry, courage, and well-directed aim of
their cannoneers and infantry.Six times the heroic Union troops dashed against the invulnerable
position, each time to be repulsed with terrific loss.General Couch, who
had command of the Second Corps, viewing the scene of battle from the
steeple of the court-house with General Howard, says: "The whole plain was
covered with men, prostrate and dropping, the live men running here and
there, and in front closing upon each other, and the wounded coming back.I had never before seen fighting like that, nothing approaching it in
terrible uproar and destruction."General Howard reports that Couch exclaimed: "Oh, great God!see how our
men, our poor fellows, are falling!"At half-past one Couch signaled
Burnside: "I am losing.The point and method of attack made by Sumner was anticipated by the
Confederates, careful preparation having been made to meet it.The fire
from the Confederate batteries harassed the Union lines, and as they
advanced steadily, heroically, without hurrah or battle-cry, the ranks
were cut to pieces by canister and shell and musket-balls.Heavy artillery
fire was poured into the Union ranks from front, right, and left with
frightful results.Quickly filling up the decimated ranks they approached
the stone wall masking the death-trap where General Cobb lay with a strong
force awaiting the approach.Torrents of lead poured into the bodies of
the defenseless men, slaying, crushing, destroying the proud army of a few
hours before.As though in pity, a cloud of smoke momentarily shut out the
wretched scene but brought no balm to the helpless victims of this awful
carnage.The ground was so thickly strewn with dead bodies as seriously to
impede the movements of a renewed attack.These repeated assaults in such
good order caused some apprehension on the part of General Lee, who said
to Longstreet after the third attack, "General, they are massing very
heavily and will break your line, I am afraid."But the great general's
fears proved groundless.General Cobb was borne from the field mortally wounded, and Kershaw took
his place in the desperate struggle.The storm of shot and shell which met
the assaults was terrific.Men fell almost in battalions; the dead and
wounded lay in heaps.Late in the day the dead bodies, which had become
frozen from the extreme cold, were stood up in front of the soldiers as a
protection against the awful fire to shield the living, and at night were
set up as dummy sentinels.The steadiness of the Union troops, and the silent, determined heroism of
the rank and file in these repeated, but hopeless, assaults upon the
Confederate works, were marvelous, and amazed even their officers.The
real greatness in a battle is the fearless courage, the brave and heroic
conduct, of the men under withering fire.It was the enlisted men who were
the glory of the army.It was they, the rank and file, who stood in the
front, closed the gaps, and were mowed down in swaths like grass by cannon
and musket-balls.After the sixth disastrous attempt to carry the works of the Confederate
left it was night; the Federal army was repulsed and had retired; hope was
abandoned, and it was seen that the day was lost to the Union side.Then
the shattered Army of the Potomac sought to gather the stragglers and care
for the wounded.Fredericksburg, the beautiful Virginia town, was a
pitiable scene in contrast to its appearance a few days before.Ancestral
homes were turned into barracks and hospitals.The charming drives and
stately groves, the wonted pleasure grounds of Colonial dames and Southern
cavaliers, were not filled with grand carriages and gay parties, but with
war horses, soldiers, and military accouterments.Aside from desultory
firing by squads and skirmishers at intervals there was no renewal of the
conflict.The bloody carnage was over, the plan of Burnside had ended in failure,
and thousands of patriotic and brave men, blindly obedient to their
country's command, were the toll exacted from the Union army.Burnside,
wild with anguish at what he had done, walking the floor of his tent,
exclaimed, "Oh, those men--those men over there," pointing to the
battlefield, "I am thinking of them all the time."In his report of the
battle to Washington, Burnside gave reasons for the issue, and in a manly
way took the responsibility upon himself, and most highly commended his
officers and men.He said, "For the failure in the attack I am
responsible, as the extreme gallantry, courage, and endurance shown by
them [officers and men] were never excelled."President Lincoln's verdict in regard to this battle is adverse to the
almost unanimous opinion of the historians.In his reply, December 22d, to
General Burnside's report of the battle, he says, "Although you were not
successful, the attempt was not an error, nor the failure other than an
accident."Burnside, at his own request, was relieved of the command of
the Army of the Potomac, however, on January 25, 1863, and was succeeded
by General Hooker.The Union loss in killed, wounded, and missing was
12,653, and the Confederates lost 5,377.After the battle the wounded lay on the field in their agony exposed to
the freezing cold for forty-eight hours before arrangements were effected
to care for them.Many were burned to death by the long, dead grass
becoming ignited by cannon fire.The scene witnessed by the army of those
screaming, agonizing, dying comrades was dreadful and heart-rending.Burnside's plan had been to renew the battle, but the overwhelming opinion
of the other officers prevailed.The order was withdrawn and the defeated
Union army slipped away under the cover of darkness on December 15th, and
encamped in safety across the river.The battle of Fredericksburg had
passed into history.[Illustration: THE SECOND LEADER AGAINST RICHMOND

COPYRIGHT 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Major-General Ambrose Everett Burnside was a West Point graduate, inventor
of a breech-loading rifle, commander of a brigade in the first battle of
Bull Run, captor of Roanoke Island and Newberne (North Carolina), and
commander of the Federal left at Antietam.He was appointed to the command
of the Army of the Potomac and succeeded General George B. McClellan on
November 8, 1862.He was a brave soldier, but was an impatient leader and
inclined to be somewhat reckless.He pressed rapidly his advance against
Lee and massed his entire army along Stafford Heights, on the east bank of
the Rappahannock, opposite Fredericksburg.According to General W. B.
Franklin (who commanded the left grand division of the army), the notion
that a serious battle was necessary to Federal control of the town "was
not entertained by any one."General Sumner (who led the advance of
Burnside's army) held this opinion but he had not received orders to cross
the river.Crossing was delayed nearly a month and this delay resulted in
the Federal disaster on December 13th.This put an abrupt end to active
operations by Burnside against Lee.This picture was taken at Warrenton,
November 24th, on the eve of the departure of the army for its march to
Fredericksburg.[Illustration: THE DETAINED GUNS

town had suffered its bombardment in December of the previous year.Again
the armies were separated by the Rappahannock River.There was a new
commander at the head of the Army of the Potomac--General Hooker.The
plundered and deserted town now held by the Confederates was to be made
the objective of another attack.The heights beyond were once more to be
assaulted; bridges were to be rebuilt.This ground
of much contention was deserted some time before Lee advanced to his
invasion of Pennsylvania.Very slowly the inhabitants of Fredericksburg
had returned to their ruined homes.The town was a vast Federal cemetery,
the dead being buried in gardens and backyards, for during its occupancy
almost every dwelling had been turned into a temporary hospital.After the
close of the war these bodies were gathered and a National Cemetery was
established on Willis' Hill, on Marye's Heights, the point successfully
defended by Lee's veterans.Heavy pontoon-boats, each on its separate wagon, were sometimes as
necessary as food or ammunition.At every important crossing of the many
rivers that had to be passed in the Peninsula Campaign the bridges had
been destroyed.There were few places where these streams were fordable.Pontoons, therefore, made a most important adjunct to the Army of the
Potomac.[Illustration: PONTOON-BOATS IN TRANSIT]

scene.On those memorable days of December 11 and 12, 1862, from these
very trenches shown in the foreground, the ragged gray riflemen saw on
that hillside across the river the blue of the uniforms of the massed
Federal troops.The lines of tents made great white spaces, but the ground
could hardly be seen for the host of men who were waiting, alas!to die by
thousands on this coveted shore.From these hills, too, burst an incessant
flaming and roaring cannon fire.Siege-guns and field artillery poured
shot and shell into the town of Fredericksburg.Every house became a
target, though deserted except for a few hardy and venturesome riflemen.Ruined and battered and
bloody, Fredericksburg three times was a Federal hospital, and its
backyards became little cemeteries.[Illustration: A TARGET AT FREDERICKSBURG FOR THE FEDERAL GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]At Franklin Crossing, on the Rappahannock, occurred an incident that
proves how little things may change the whole trend of the best-laid
plans.The left Union wing under the command of General Franklin, composed
of the First Army Corps under General Reynolds, and the Sixth under
General W. F. Smith, was crossing to engage in the battle of
Fredericksburg.For two days they poured across these yielding planks
between the swaying boats to the farther shore.Now, in the crossing of
bridges, moving bodies of men must break step or even well-built
structures might be threatened.The colonel of one of the regiments in
General Devens' division that led the van ordered his field music to
strike up just as the head of the column swept on to the flimsy planking;
before the regiment was half-way across, unconsciously the men had fallen
into step and the whole fabric was swaying to the cadenced feet.Vibrating
like a great fiddle-string, the bridge would have sunk and parted, but a
keen eye had seen the danger.was the order, and a
staff officer spurred his horse through the men, shouting at top voice.The lone charge was made through the marching column: some jumped into the
pontoons to avoid the hoofs; a few went overboard; but the head of the
column was reached at last, and the music stopped.A greater blunder than
this, however, took place on the plains beyond.Owing to a
misunderstanding of orders, 37,000 troops were never brought into action;
17,000 men on their front bore the brunt of a long day's fighting.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE FAMOUS "IRISH BRIGADE"

advanced in Hancock's Division to the first assault at Marye's Heights, on
December 13, 1862.In this charge the Irish soldiers moved steadily up the
ridge until within a few yards of a sunken road, from which unexpected
fire mowed them down.Of the 1,315 men which Meagher led into battle, 545
fell in that charge.The officer standing is Colonel Patrick Kelly, of the
Eighty-eighth New York, who was one of the valiant heroes of this charge,
and succeeded to the command of the Irish Brigade after General Meagher.The officer seated is Captain Clooney, of the

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Marye's House marked the center of the Confederate position on the
Heights, before which the Federals fell three deep in one of the bravest
and bloodiest assaults of the war.The eastern boundary of the Marye
estate was a retaining wall, along which ran a sunken road; on the other
side of this was a stone wall, shoulder high, forming a perfect infantry
parapet.Here two brigades of Confederates were posted and on the crest
above them were the supporting batteries, while the <DW72> between was
honeycombed with the rifle-pits of the sharpshooters, one of which is seen
in the picture.Six times did the Federals, raked by the deadly fire of
the Washington Artillery, advance to within a hundred yards of the sunken
road, only to be driven back by the rapid volleys of the Confederate
infantry concealed there.Less than three of every five men in Hancock's
division came back from their charge on these death-dealing heights.The
complete repulse of the day and the terrific slaughter were the barren
results of an heroic effort to obey orders.[Illustration: THE FATEFUL CROSSING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.From this, the Lacy House, which Sumner had made his headquarters, he
directed the advance of his right grand division of the Army of the
Potomac on December 11, 1862.Little did he dream that his men of the
Second Corps were to bear the brunt of the fighting and the most crushing
blow of the defeat on the 13th.Soon after three o'clock on the morning of
the 11th the columns moved out with alacrity to the river bank and before
daybreak, hidden at first by the fog, the pontoniers began building the
bridges.Confederate sharpshooters drove off the working party from the
bridge below the Lacy House and also from the middle bridge farther down.As the mist cleared, volunteers ferried themselves over in the boats and
drove off the riflemen.At last, at daybreak of the 12th, the town of
Fredericksburg was occupied, but the whole of another foggy day was
consumed in getting the army concentrated on the western shore.Nineteen
batteries (one hundred and four guns) accompanied Sumner's troops, but all
save seven of these were ordered back or left in the streets of
Fredericksburg.Late on the morning of the 13th the confused and belated
orders began to arrive from Burnside's headquarters across the river; one
was for Sumner to assault the Confederate batteries on Marye's Heights.At
nightfall Sumner's men retired into Fredericksburg, leaving 4,800 dead or
wounded on the field."Oh, those men, those men over there!I cannot get
them out of my mind!"wailed Burnside in an agony of failure.Yet he was
planning almost in the same breath to lead in person his old command, the
Ninth Corps, in another futile charge in the morning.On the night of the
14th, better judgment prevailed and the order came to retire across the
Rappahannock.[Illustration: NEW LEADERS AND NEW PLANS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.These were the men whose work it was,
during the winter after Fredericksburg, to restore the _esprit de corps_
of the Army of the Potomac.The tireless energy and magnetic personality
of Hooker soon won officers from their disaffection and put an end to
desertions--which had been going on at the rate of two hundred per day
before he took command.By spring everything seemed propitious for an
aggressive campaign, the plans for which were brilliantly drawn and at
first vigorously carried out, giving truth to Lincoln's expressed belief
that Hooker was "a trained and skilful soldier."In that remarkable letter
of admonition to Hooker upon assuming command, Lincoln added: "But beware
of rashness, beware of rashness; with energy and with sleepless vigilance
go forward and give us victories."By some strange fate it was not
rashness but quite the contrary which compassed the failure of "Fighting
Joe" Hooker at Chancellorsville.His first forward advance was executed
with his usual bold initiative.Before Lee could fully divine his purpose,
Hooker with thirty-six thousand men was across his left flank in a
favorable position, with the main body of his army at hand ready to give
battle.Then came Hooker's inexplicable order to fall back upon
Chancellorsville.That very night, consulting in the abandoned Federal
position, Lee and Jackson formed the plan which drove Hooker back across
the Rappahannock in ignominious defeat.CHANCELLORSVILLE AND JACKSON'S FLANKING MARCH


After the Fredericksburg campaign the Union forces encamped at Falmouth
for the winter, while Lee remained with the Southern army on the site of
his successful contest at Fredericksburg.Thus the two armies lay facing
each other within hailing distance, across the historic river, waiting for
the coming of spring.Major-General Joseph Hooker, popularly known as
"Fighting Joe" Hooker, who had succeeded Burnside in command of the Army
of the Potomac, soon had the troops on a splendid campaign footing.His
force was between 125,000 and 130,000 men; Lee's, about 60,000.Hooker conceived a plan of campaign which was ingenious and masterful, and
had he carried it out there would have been a different story to tell
about Chancellorsville.The plan was to deploy a portion of the army to
serve as a decoy to Lee, while the remainder of the host at the same time
occupied the vicinity of Chancellorsville, a country mansion, in the
center of the wilderness that stretched along the Rappahannock.Lee was a great general and a master in strategy.He had learned of
Hooker's plan and, paying but little attention to Sedgwick east of
Fredericksburg, had turned to face Hooker.By a rapid night march he met
the Union army before it had reached its destination.He was pushed back,
however, by Sykes, of Meade's corps, who occupied the position assigned to
him.Meade was on the left, and Slocum on the right, with adequate support
in the rear.All was in readiness and most favorable for the "certain
destruction" of the Confederates predicted by "Fighting Joe" when, to the
amazement and consternation of all his officers, Hooker ordered the whole
army to retire to the position it had occupied the day before, leaving the
advantage to his opponents.Lee quickly moved his army into the position thus relinquished, and began
feeling the Federal lines with skirmishers and some cannonading during the
evening of May 1st.By the next morning the two armies were in line of
battle.The danger in which the Confederate army now found itself was extreme.One
large Federal army was on its front, while another was at its rear, below
Fredericksburg.But Lee threw the hopes of success into one great and
decisive blow at Hooker's host.Dividing an army in the face of the foe is
extremely dangerous and contrary to all accepted theories of military
strategy; but there comes a time when such a course proves the salvation
of the legions in peril.Such was the case at Chancellorsville on May 2,
1863.the cannonading began its death-song and was soon followed by
infantry demonstrations, but without serious results.Early in the afternoon, Hooker by a ruse was beguiled into the
belief that Lee's army was in full retreat.What Hooker had seen and
believed to be a retreat was the marching of Jackson's forces, about
twenty-six thousand strong, from the battlefield.What he did not see,
however, was that, after a few miles, Jackson turned abruptly and made for
the right flank of the Federal host, the Eleventh Corps, under Howard.It
was after half-past five when Jackson broke from the woods into which he
had marched in a paralyzing charge upon the unprepared troops of Howard.The approach of this Confederate force was first intimated to the Federals
by the bending of shrubbery, the stampede of rabbits and squirrels, and
the flocks of birds in wild flight, as before a storm.Then appeared a few
skirmishers, then a musket volley, and then the storm broke in all its
fury--the war scream, the rattling musketry, the incessant roar of cannon.The knowledge that "Old Jack" was on
the field was inspiration enough for them.The charge was so precipitous,
so unexpected and terrific that it was impossible for the Federals to hold
their lines and stand against the impact of that awful onslaught which
carried everything before it.The regiments in Jackson's path, resisting
his advance, were cut to pieces and swept along as by a tidal wave, rolled
up like a scroll, multitudes of men, horses, mules, and cattle being piled
in an inextricable mass.Characteristic of Jackson's brilliant and
unexpected movements, it was like an electric flash, knocking the Eleventh
Corps into impotence, as Jackson expected it would.This crowning and
final stroke of Jackson's military genius was not impromptu, but the
result of his own carefully worked-out plan, which had been approved by
Lee.General Hooker was spending the late afternoon hours in his headquarters
at the Chancellor house.To the eastward there was considerable firing,
where his men were carrying out the plan of striking Lee in flank.Jackson
was retreating, of that he was sure, and Sickles, with Pleasanton's
cavalry and other reenforcements, was in pursuit.About half-past six the sounds of battle grew suddenly louder
and seemed to come from another direction.A staff-officer went to the
front of the house and turned his field-glass toward the west.At the startled cry Hooker sprang upon his horse and dashed down the road.He encountered portions of the Eleventh Corps pouring out of the forest--a
badly mixed crowd of men, wagons, and ambulances.They brought the news
that the right wing was overwhelmed.Hurriedly Hooker sought his old
command, Berry's division of the Third Corps, stationed in support of the
Eleventh.An officer who witnessed the scene says the division advanced with a firm
and steady step, cleaving the multitude of disbanded Federals as the bow
of a vessel cleaves the waves of the sea.It struck the advance of the
Confederates obliquely and checked it, with the aid of the Twelfth Corps
artillery.A dramatic, though tragic, feature of the rout was the charge of the
Eighth Pennsylvania cavalry, under Major Keenan, in the face of almost
certain death, to save the artillery of the Third Corps from capture.The
guns rested upon low ground and within reach of the Confederates.The
Federals had an equal opportunity to seize the artillery, but required a
few minutes to prepare themselves for action.The Confederate advance must
be checked for these few moments, and for this purpose Keenan gallantly
led his five hundred cavalrymen into the woods, while his comrades brought
the guns to bear upon the columns in gray.He gained the necessary time,
but lost his life at the head of his regiment, together with Captain
Arrowsmith and Adjutant Haddock, who fell by his side.The light of day had faded from the gruesome scene.The mighty turmoil was
silenced as darkness gathered, but the day's carnage was not ended.No
camp-fires were lighted in the woods or on the plain.The two hostile
forces were concealed in the darkness, watching through the shadows,
waiting for--they knew not what.Finally at midnight the order "Forward"
was repeated in subdued tones along the lines of Sickles' corps.Out over
the open and into the deep, dark thicket the men in blue pursued their
stealthy advance upon the Confederate position.Then the tragedies of the
night were like that of the day, and the moon shed her peaceful rays down
upon those shadowy figures as they struggled forward through the woods, in
the ravines, over the hillocks.The Federals, at heavy loss, gained the
position, and the engagement assumed the importance of a victory.It was on this day that death robbed the South of one of her most beloved
warriors.After darkness had overspread the land, Jackson, accompanied by
members of his staff, undertook a reconnaissance of the Federal lines.He came upon a line of Union infantry lying
on its arms and was forced to turn back along the plank road, on both
sides of which he had stationed his own men with orders to fire upon any
body of men approaching from the direction of the Federal battle-lines.The little cavalcade of Confederate officers galloped along the highway,
directly toward the ambuscade, and apparently forgetful of the strict
orders left with the skirmishers.A sudden flash of flame lighted the
scene for an instant, and within that space of time the Confederacy was
deprived of one of its greatest captains.Jackson was severely wounded,
and by his own men and through his own orders.When the news spread
through Jackson's corps and through the Confederate army the grief of the
Southern soldiers was heartbreaking to witness.The sorrow spread even
into the ranks of the Federal army, which, while opposed to the wounded
general on many hard-fought battle-grounds, had learned to respect and
admire "Stonewall" Jackson.The loss of Jackson to the South was incalculable.Lee had pronounced him
the right arm of the whole army.Next to Lee, Jackson was considered the
ablest general in the Confederate army.His shrewdness of judgment, his
skill in strategy, his lightning-like strokes, marked him as a unique and
brilliant leader.Devoutly religious, gentle and noble in character, the
nation that was not to be disunited lost a great citizen, as the
Confederate army lost a great captain, when a few days later General
Jackson died.That night orders passed from the Federal headquarters to Sedgwick, below
Fredericksburg, eleven miles away.Between him and Hooker stood the
Confederate army, flushed with its victories of the day.Immediately in
his front was Fredericksburg, with a strong guard of Southern warriors.Beyond loomed Marye's Heights, the battle-ground on which Burnside had in
the preceding winter left so many of his brave men in the vain endeavor to
drive the Confederate defenders from the crest.The courageous Sedgwick, notwithstanding the formidable obstacles that lay
on the road to Chancellorsville, responded immediately to Hooker's order.He was already on the south side of the river, but he was farther away
than Hooker supposed.Shortly after midnight he began a march that was
fraught with peril and death.Strong resistance was offered the advancing
blue columns as they came to the threshold of Fredericksburg, but they
swept on and over the defenders, and at dawn were at the base of the
heights.On the crest waved the standards of the Confederate Washington
Artillery.At the foot of the <DW72> was the stone wall before which the
Federals had fought and died but a few months before, in the battle of
Fredericksburg.Reenforcements were arriving in the Confederate trenches
constantly.The crest and <DW72>s bristled with cannon and muskets.The
pathways around the heights were barricaded.The route to the front seemed
blocked; still, the cry for help from Hooker was resounding in the ears of
Sedgwick.Gathering his troops, he attacked directly upon the stone wall and on up
the hillside, in the face of a terrific storm of artillery and musketry.The first assault failed; a flank movement met with no better success; and
the morning was nearly gone when the Confederates finally gave way at the
point of the bayonet before the irresistible onset of men in blue.The way
to Chancellorsville was open; but the cost to the Federals was appalling.Hundreds of the soldiers in blue lay wrapped in death upon the bloody
<DW72>s of Marye's Heights.It was the middle of the afternoon, and not at daybreak, as Hooker had
directed, when Sedgwick appeared in the rear of Lee's legions.A strong
force of Confederates under Early prevented his further advance toward a
juncture with Hooker's army at Chancellorsville.Since five o'clock in
the morning the battle had been raging at the latter place, and Jackson's
men, now commanded by Stuart, though being mowed down in great numbers,
vigorously pressed the attack of the day while crying out to one another
"Remember Jackson," as they thought of their wounded leader.While this engagement was at its height General Hooker, leaning against a
pillar of the Chancellor house, was felled to the ground, and for a moment
it was thought he was killed.The pillar had been shattered by a
cannon-ball.Hooker soon revived under the doctor's care and with great
force of will he mounted his horse and showed himself to his anxious
troops.He then withdrew his army to a stronger position, well guarded
with artillery.The Confederates did not attempt to assail it.The third
day's struggle at Chancellorsville was finished by noon, except in Lee's
rear, where Sedgwick fought all day, without success, to reach the main
body of Hooker's army.The Federals suffered very serious losses during
this day's contest.Even then it was believed that the advantage rested
with the larger Army of the Potomac and that the Federals had an
opportunity to win.Thirty-seven thousand Union troops, the First, and
three-quarters of the Fifth Corps, had been entirely out of the fight on
that day.Five thousand men of the Eleventh Corps, who were eager to
retrieve their misfortune, were also inactive.When night came, and the shades of darkness hid the sights of suffering on
the battlefield, the Federal army was resting in a huge curve, the left
wing on the Rappahannock and the right on the Rapidan.In this way the
fords across the rivers which led to safety were in control of the Army of
the Potomac.Lee moved his corps close to the bivouacs of the army in
blue.But, behind the Confederate battle-line, there was a new factor in
the struggle in the person of Sedgwick, with the remnants of his gallant
corps, which had numbered nearly twenty-two thousand when they started for
the front, but now were depleted by their terrific charge upon Marye's
Heights and the subsequent hard and desperate struggle with Early in the
afternoon.Lee was between two fires--Hooker in front and Sedgwick in the rear, both
of whose forces were too strong to be attacked simultaneously.Again the
daring leader of the Confederate legions did the unexpected, and divided
his army in the presence of the foe, though he was without the aid of his
great lieutenant, "Stonewall" Jackson.During the night Lee made his preparations, and when dawn appeared in the
eastern skies the movement began.Sedgwick, weak and battered by his
contact with Early on the preceding afternoon, resisted bravely, but to no
avail, and the Confederates closed in upon him on three sides, leaving the
way to Banks's Ford on the Rappahannock open to escape.Slowly the
Federals retreated and, as night descended, rested upon the river bank.After dark the return to the northern side was begun by Sedgwick's men,
and the Chancellorsville campaign was practically ended.The long, deep trenches full of Federal and Confederate dead told the
awful story of Chancellorsville.If we gaze into these trenches, which by
human impulse we are led to do, after the roar and din of the carnage is
still, the scene greeting the eye will never be forgotten.Side by side,
the heroes in torn and bloody uniforms, their only shrouds, were gently
laid.The Union loss in killed and wounded was a little over seventeen thousand,
and it cost the South thirteen thousand men to gain this victory on the
banks of the Rappahannock.The loss to both armies in officers was very
heavy.The two armies were weary and more than decimated.It appeared that both
were glad at the prospect of a cessation of hostilities.On the night of
May 5th, in a severe storm, Hooker conveyed his corps safely across the
river and settled the men again in their cantonments of the preceding
winter at Falmouth.The Confederates returned to their old encampment at
Fredericksburg.[Illustration: A MAN OF WHOM MUCH WAS EXPECTED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]A daring and experienced veteran of the Mexican
War, Hooker had risen in the Civil War from brigade commander to be the
commander of a grand division of the Army of the Potomac, and had never
been found wanting.His advancement to the head of the Army of the
Potomac, on January 26, 1863, was a tragic episode in his own career and
in that of the Federal arms.Gloom hung heavy over the North after
Fredericksburg.Upon Hooker fell the difficult task of redeeming the
unfulfilled political pledges for a speedy lifting of that gloom.It was
his fortune only to deepen it.[Illustration: "STONEWALL" JACKSON--TWO WEEKS BEFORE HIS MORTAL WOUND

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The austere, determined features of the victor of Chancellorsville, just
as they appeared two weeks before the tragic shot that cost the
Confederacy its greatest Lieutenant-General--and, in the opinion of sound
historians, its chief hope for independence.Only once had a war
photograph of Jackson been taken up to April, 1863, when, just before the
movement toward Chancellorsville, he was persuaded to enter a
photographer's tent at Hamilton's Crossing, some three miles below
Fredericksburg, and to sit for his last portrait.At a glance one can feel
the self-expression and power in this stern worshiper of the God of
Battles; one can understand the eulogy written by the British military
historian, Henderson: "The fame of 'Stonewall' Jackson is no longer the
exclusive property of Virginia and the South; it has become the birthright
of every man privileged to call himself an American."[Illustration: WHERE "STONEWALL" JACKSON FELL]

In this tangled nook Lee's right-hand man was shot through a terrible
mistake of his own soldiers.After his
brilliant flank march, the evening attack on the rear of Hooker's army had
just been driven home.About half-past eight, Jackson had ridden beyond
his lines to reconnoiter for the final advance.A single rifle-shot rang
out in the darkness.The outposts of the two armies were engaged.Jackson
turned toward his own line, where the Eighteenth North Carolina was
stationed.The regiment, keenly on the alert and startled by the group of
strange horsemen riding through the gloom, fired a volley that brought
several men and horses to the earth.Jackson was struck once in the right
hand and twice in the left arm, a little below the shoulder.His horse
dashed among the trees; but with his bleeding right hand Jackson succeeded
in seizing the reins and turning the frantic animal back into the road.Only with difficulty was the general taken to the rear so that his wounds
might be dressed.To his attendants he said, "Tell them simply that you
have a wounded Confederate officer."To one who asked if he was seriously
hurt, he replied: "Don't bother yourself about me.Win the battle first
and attend to the wounded afterward."He was taken to Guiney's Station.At
first it was hoped that he would recover, but pneumonia set in and his
strength gradually ebbed.On Sunday evening, May 10th, he uttered the
words which inspired the young poet, Sidney Lanier, to write his elegy,
beautiful in its serene resignation.[Illustration: THE STONE WALL AT FREDERICKSBURG

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Behind the deadly stone wall of Marye's Heights after Sedgwick's men had
swept across it in the gallant charge of May 3, 1863.This was one of the
strongest natural positions stormed during the war.In front of this wall
the previous year, nearly 6,000 of Burnside's men had fallen, and it was
not carried.Again in the Chancellorsville campaign Sedgwick's Sixth Corps
was ordered to assault it.It was defended the second time with the same
death-dealing stubbornness but with less than a fourth of the former
numbers--9,000 Confederates against 20,000 Federals.At eleven o'clock in
the morning the line of battle, under Colonel Hiram Burnham, moved out
over the awful field of the year before, supported to right and left by
flanking columns.Up to within twenty-five yards of the wall they pressed,
when again the flame of musketry fire belched forth, laying low in six
minutes 36.5 per cent.The
assailants wavered and rallied, and then with one impulse both columns and
line of battle hurled themselves upon the wall in a fierce hand-to-hand
combat.A soldier of the Seventh Massachusetts happened to peer through a
crack in a board fence and saw that it covered the flank of the double
line of Confederates in the road.Up and over the fence poured the
Federals and drove the Confederates from the heights.[Illustration: THE WORK OF ONE SHELL

Federals swarmed up and over the ridge above, driving the Confederates
from the rifle-pits, capturing the guns of the famous Washington Artillery
which had so long guarded the Heights, and inflicting slaughter upon the
assaulting columns.If Sedgwick had had cavalry he could have crushed the
divided forces of Early and cleared the way for a rapid advance to attack
Lee's rear.In the picture we see Confederate caisson wagons and horses
destroyed by a lucky shot from the Second Massachusetts' siege-gun battery
planted across the river at Falmouth to support Sedgwick's assault.Surveying the scene stands General Herman Haupt, Chief of the Bureau of
Military Railways, the man leaning against the stump.By him is W. W.

driven off by fresh forces which Lee had detached from his main army at
Chancellorsville and sent against Sedgwick on the afternoon of the 4th.[Illustration: THE DEMOLISHED HEADQUARTERS]

From this mansion, Hooker's headquarters during the battle of
Chancellorsville, he rode away after the injury he received there on May
3d, never to return.The general, dazed after Jackson's swoop upon the
right, was besides in deep anxiety as to Sedgwick.The latter's forty
thousand men had not yet come up.Hooker was unwilling to suffer further
loss without the certainty of his cooperation.The movement was the signal for increased artillery fire from
the Confederate batteries, marking the doom of the old Chancellor house.Its end was accompanied by some heartrending scenes.Major Bigelow thus
describes them: "Missiles pierced the walls or struck in the brickwork;
shells exploded in the upper rooms, setting the building on fire; the
chimneys were demolished and their fragments rained down upon the wounded
about the building.All this time the women and children (including some
slaves) of the Chancellor family, nineteen persons in all, were in the

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In modern warfare the American Indian seems somehow to be entirely out of
place.We think of him with the tomahawk and scalping-knife and have
difficulty in conceiving him in the ranks, drilling, doing police duty,
and so on.Yet more than three thousand Indians were enlisted in the
Federal army.The Confederates enlisted many more in Missouri, Arkansas,
and Texas.In the Federal army the red men were used as advance
sharpshooters and rendered meritorious service.This photograph shows some

agony.During the campaign of 1864, from the Wilderness to Appomattox,
Captain Ely S. Parker, a gigantic Indian, became one of Grant's favorite
aids.Before the close of the war he had been promoted to the rank of
colonel, and it was he who drafted in a beautiful handwriting the terms of
Lee's surrender.He stood over six feet in height and was a conspicuous
figure on Grant's staff.The Southwestern Indians engaged in some of the
earliest battles under General Albert Pike, a Northerner by birth, but a
Southern sympathizer.[Illustration: THE BOMBARDMENT OF PORT HUDSON._Painted by E. Packbauer._

VICKSBURG AND PORT HUDSON

    On the banks of this, the greatest river in the world, the most
    decisive and far-reaching battle of the war was fought.Here at
    Vicksburg over one hundred thousand gallant soldiers and a powerful
    fleet of gunboats and ironclads in terrible earnestness for forty days
    and nights fought to decide whether the new Confederate States should
    be cut in twain; whether the great river should flow free to the Gulf,
    or should have its commerce hindered.We all know the result--the
    Union army under General Grant, and the Union navy under Admiral
    Porter were victorious.The Confederate army, under General Pemberton,
    numbering thirty thousand men, was captured and General Grant's army
    set free for operating in other fields.It was a staggering blow from
    which the Confederacy never rallied.--_Lieutenant-General Stephen D.
    Lee, C. S. A., at the dedication of the Massachusetts Volunteers'
    statue at the Vicksburg National Military Park, Vicksburg,
    Mississippi, November 14, 1903._


The Mississippi River, in its lower course, winds like a mighty serpent
from side to side along a vast alluvial bottom, which in places is more
than forty miles in width.On the eastern bank, these great coils here and
there sweep up to the bluffs of the highlands of Tennessee and
Mississippi.On these cliffs are situated Memphis, Port Hudson, Grand
Gulf, and Vicksburg.The most important of these from a military point of
view was Vicksburg, often called the "Gibraltar of the West."Situated two
hundred feet above the current, on a great bend of the river, its cannon
could command the waterway for miles in either direction, while the
obstacles in the way of a land approach were almost equally
insurmountable.The Union arms had captured New Orleans, in the spring of 1862, and
Memphis in June of that year; but the Confederates still held Vicksburg
and Port Hudson and the two hundred and fifty miles of river that lies
between them.The military object of the Federal armies in the West was
to gain control of the entire course of the great Mississippi that it
might "roll unvexed to the sea," to use Lincoln's terse expression, and
that the rich States of the Southwest, from which the Confederacy drew
large supplies and thousands of men for her armies, might be cut off from
the rest of the South.If Vicksburg were captured, Port Hudson must fall.The problem, therefore, was how to get control of Vicksburg.On the promotion of Halleck to the command of all the armies of the North,
with headquarters at Washington, Grant was left in superior command in the
West and the great task before him was the capture of the "Gibraltar of
the West."Vicksburg might have been occupied by the Northern armies at
any time during the first half of the year 1862, but in June of that year
General Bragg sent Van Dorn with a force of fifteen thousand to occupy and
fortify the heights.Van Dorn was a man of prodigious energy.In a short
time he had hundreds of men at work planting batteries, digging rifle-pits
above the water front and in the rear of the town, mounting heavy guns and
building bomb-proof magazines in tiers along the hillsides.All through
the summer, the work progressed under the direction of Engineer S. H.
Lockett, and by the coming of winter the city was a veritable Gibraltar.From the uncompleted batteries on the Vicksburg bluffs, the citizens and
the garrison soldiers viewed the advance division of Farragut's fleet,
under Commander Lee, in the river, on May 18, 1862.Fifteen hundred
infantry were on board, under command of General Thomas Williams, and with
them was a battery of artillery.Williams reconnoitered the works, and
finding them too strong for his small force he returned to occupy Baton
Rouge.The authorities at Washington now sent Farragut peremptory orders
to clear the Mississippi and accordingly about the middle of June, a
flotilla of steamers and seventeen mortar schooners, under Commander D. D.
Porter, departed from New Orleans and steamed up the river.Simultaneously Farragut headed a fleet of three war vessels and seven
gunboats, carrying one hundred and six guns, toward Vicksburg from Baton
Rouge.Many transports accompanied the ships from Baton Rouge, on which
there were three thousand of Williams' troops.The last days of June witnessed the arrival of the combined naval forces
of Farragut and Porter below the Confederate stronghold.Williams
immediately disembarked his men on the Louisiana shore, opposite
Vicksburg, and they were burdened with implements required in digging
trenches and building levees.The mighty Mississippi, at this point and in those days, swept in a
majestic bend and formed a peninsula of the western, or Louisiana shore.Vicksburg was situated on the eastern, or Mississippi shore, below the top
of the bend.Its batteries of cannon commanded the river approach for
miles in either direction.Federal engineers quickly recognized the
strategic position of the citadel on the bluff; and also as quickly saw a
method by which the passage up and down the river could be made
comparatively safe for their vessels, and at the same time place Vicksburg
"high and dry" by cutting a channel for the Mississippi through the neck
of land that now held it in its sinuous course.While Farragut stormed the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg, Williams
began the tremendous task of diverting the mighty current across the
peninsula.Farragut's bombardment by his entire fleet failed to silence
Vicksburg's cannon-guards, although the defenders likewise failed to stop
the progress of the fleet.The Federal naval commander then determined to
dash past the fortifications, trusting to the speed of his vessels and the
stoutness of their armor to survive the tremendous cannonade that would
fall upon his flotilla.Early in the morning of June 28th the thrilling
race against death began, and after two hours of terrific bombardment
aided by the mortar boats stationed on both banks, Farragut's fleet with
the exception of three vessels passed through the raging inferno to the
waters above Vicksburg, with a loss of fifteen killed and thirty wounded.On the 1st of July Flag-Officer Davis with his river gunboats arrived from
Memphis and joined Farragut.Williams and his men, including one thousand <DW64>s, labored like Titans
to complete their canal, but a sudden rise of the river swept away the
barriers with a terrific roar, and the days of herculean labor went for
naught.Again Williams' attempt to subdue the stronghold was abandoned,
and he returned with his men when Farragut did, on July 24th, to Baton
Rouge to meet death there on August 5th when General Breckinridge made a
desperate but unsuccessful attempt to drive the Union forces from the
Louisiana capital.Farragut urged upon General Halleck the importance of occupying the city
on the bluff with a portion of his army; but that general gave no heed;
and while even then it was too late to secure the prize without a contest,
it would have been easy in comparison to that which it required a year
later.In the mean time, the river steamers took an important part in the
preliminary operations against the city.Davis remained at Memphis with
his fleet for about three weeks after the occupation of that city on the
6th of June, meanwhile sending four gunboats and a transport up the White
River, with the Forty-sixth Indiana regiment, under Colonel Fitch.The
object of the expedition, undertaken at Halleck's command, was to destroy
Confederate batteries and to open communication with General Curtis, who
was approaching from the west.It failed in the latter purpose but did
some effective work with the Southern batteries along the way.The one extraordinary incident of the expedition was the disabling of the
_Mound City_, one of the ironclad gunboats, and the great loss of life
that it occasioned.Charles the troops under Fitch were
landed, and the _Mound City_ moving up the river, was fired on by
concealed batteries under the direction of Lieutenant Dunnington.A
32-pound shot struck the vessel, crashed through the side and passed
through the steam-drum.Many of
the men were so quickly enveloped in the scalding vapor that they had no
chance to escape.Others leaped overboard, some being drowned and some
rescued through the efforts of the _Conestoga_ which was lying near.While
straining every nerve to save their lives, the men had to endure a shower
of bullets from Confederate sharpshooters on the river banks.Of the one
hundred and seventy-five officers and men of the _Mound City_ only
twenty-five escaped death or injury in that fearful catastrophe.Meanwhile, Colonel Fitch with his land forces rushed upon the Confederate
batteries and captured them.The unfortunate vessel was at length repaired
and returned to service.For some time it had been known in Federal military and naval circles that
a powerful ironclad similar to the famous _Monitor_ of Eastern waters was
being rushed to completion up the Yazoo.The new vessel was the
_Arkansas_.On July 15th, she steamed through the Union fleet, bravely
exchanging broadsides, and lodged safely under the guns of Vicksburg.That
evening the Federal boats in turn ran past the doughty _Arkansas_, but
failed to destroy her.The month of July had not been favorable to the Federal hopes.Farragut
had returned to New Orleans.General Williams had gone with him as far as
Baton Rouge.Davis now went with his fleet back to Helena.Halleck was
succeeded by Grant.Vicksburg entered upon a period of quiet.The city's experience of blood and fire
had only begun.During the summer and autumn of 1862, the one thought
uppermost in the mind of General Grant was how to gain possession of the
stronghold.He was already becoming known for his bull-dog tenacity.In
the autumn, two important changes took place, but one day apart.On
October 14th, General John C. Pemberton succeeded Van Dorn in command of
the defenses of Vicksburg, and on the next day David D. Porter succeeded
Davis as commander of the Federal fleet on the upper Mississippi.So arduous was the task of taking Vicksburg that the wits of General
Grant, and those of his chief adviser, General W. T. Sherman, were put to
the test in the last degree to accomplish the end.Grant knew that the
capture of this fortified city was of great importance to the Federal
cause, and that it would ever be looked upon as one of the chief acts in
the drama of the Civil War.The first plan attempted was to divide the army, Sherman taking part of it
from Memphis and down the Mississippi on transports, while Grant should
move southward along the line of the Mississippi Central Railroad to
cooperate with Sherman, his movements to be governed by the efforts of the
scattered Confederate forces in Mississippi to block him.But the whole
plan was destined to failure, through the energies of General Van Dorn and
others of the Confederate army near Grant's line of communication.The authorities at Washington preferred the river move upon Vicksburg, as
the navy could keep the line of communication open.The stronghold now
stood within a strong line of defense extending from Haynes' Bluff on the
Yazoo to Grand Gulf on the Mississippi, thirty miles below Vicksburg.To
prepare for Sherman's attack across the swamps of the Yazoo, Admiral
Porter made several expeditions up that tortuous stream to silence
batteries and remove torpedoes.In one of these he lost one of the Eads
ironclads, the _Cairo_, blown up by a torpedo, and in another the brave
Commander Gwin, one of the heroes of Shiloh, was mortally wounded.Sherman, with an army of thirty-two thousand men, left Memphis on December
20th, and landed a few days later some miles north of Vicksburg on the
banks of the Yazoo.On the 29th he made a daring attack in three columns
on the Confederate lines of defense at Chickasaw Bayou and suffered a
decisive repulse.His loss was nearly two thousand men; the Confederate
loss was scarcely two hundred.Two hundred feet above the bayou, beyond where the Federals were
approaching, towered the Chickasaw Bluffs, to which Pemberton hastened
troops from Vicksburg as soon as he learned Sherman's object.At the base
of the bluff, and stretching away to the north and west were swamps and
forests intersected by deep sloughs, overhung with dense tangles of vines
and cane-brakes.Federal valor vied with Confederate pluck in this fight
among the marshes and fever-infested jungle-land.One of Sherman's storming parties, under General G. W. Morgan, came upon a
broad and deep enlargement of the bayou, McNutt Lake, which interposed
between it and the Confederates in the rifle-pits on the <DW72>s and crest
of the bluff.In the darkness of the night of December 28th, the Federal
pontoniers labored to construct a passage-way across the lake.When
morning dawned the weary pontoniers were chagrined to discover their
well-built structure spanning a slough leading in another direction than
toward the base of the bluff.The bridge was quickly taken up, and the
Federals recommenced their labors, this time in daylight and within sight
and range of the Southern regiments on the hill.The men in blue worked
desperately to complete the span before driven away by the foe's cannon;
but the fire increased with every minute, and the Federals finally
withdrew.Another storming party attempted to assail the Confederates from across a
sandbar of the bayou, but was halted at the sight and prospect of
overcoming a fifteen-foot bank on the farther side.The crumbling bank was
surmounted with a levee three feet high; the steep sides of the barrier
had crumbled away, leaving an overhanging shelf, two feet wide.Two
companies of the Sixth Missouri regiment volunteered to cross the two
hundred yards of exposed passage, and to cut a roadway through the rotten
bank to allow their comrades a free path to the bluff beyond.To add to
the peril of the crossing, the sandbar was strewn with tangles of
undergrowth and fallen trees, and the Confederate shells and bullets were
raining upon the ground.Still, the gallant troops began their dash.From
the very start, a line of wounded and dead Missourians marked the passage
of the volunteers.The survivors reached the bank and desperately sought
to dig the roadway.From the shrubbery on the bank suddenly appeared
Confederate sharpshooters who poured their fire into the laboring
soldiers; the flame of the discharging muskets burned the clothing of the
Federals because the hostile forces were so close.Human endurance could
not stand before this carnage, and the brave Missourians fled from the
inferno.Sherman now found the northern pathway to Vicksburg impassable,
and withdrew his men to the broad Mississippi.Earlier in the same month had occurred two other events which, with the
defeat of Chickasaw, go to make up the triple disaster to the Federals.On
the 11th, General Nathan Forrest, one of the most brilliant cavalry
leaders on either side, began one of those destructive raids which
characterize the Civil War.With twenty-five hundred horsemen, Forrest
dashed unopposed through the country north of Grant's army, tore up sixty
miles of railroad and destroyed all telegraph lines.Meantime, on December 20th, the day on which Sherman left Memphis, General
Van Dorn pounced upon Holly Springs, in Mississippi, like an eagle on its
prey, capturing the guard of fifteen hundred men and burning the great
store of supplies, worth $1,500,000, which Grant had left there.Through
the raids of Forrest and Van Dorn, Grant was left without supplies and for
eleven days without communication with the outside world.He marched
northward to Grand Junction, in Tennessee, a distance of eighty miles,
living off the country.It was not until January 8, 1863, that he heard,
through Washington, of the defeat of Sherman in his assault on Chickasaw
Bluffs.Grant and Sherman had no thought of abandoning Vicksburg because of this
failure.But a month of unfortunate military dissension over rank in the
command of Sherman's army resulted in General John A. McClernand, armed
with authority from Washington, coming down from Illinois and superseding
Sherman.On January 11, 1864, he captured Arkansas Post, a stronghold on
the Arkansas River.But Grant, having authority to supersede McClernand in
the general proceedings against Vicksburg, did so, on January 30th, and
arguments on military precedence were forgotten.Grant was determined to lead his Army of the Tennessee below Vicksburg and
approach the city from the south, without breaking with his base of
supplies up the river.Two projects, both of which were destined to fail,
were under way during the winter and spring months of 1863.One of these
was to open a way for the river craft through Lake Providence, west of the
Mississippi, through various bayous and rivers into the Red River, a
detour of four hundred miles.Another plan was to cut a channel through the peninsula of the great bend
of the Mississippi, opposite Vicksburg.For six weeks, thousands of men
worked like marmots digging this ditch; but, meantime, the river was
rising and, on March 8th, it broke over the embankment and the men had to
run for their lives.Many horses were drowned and a great number of
implements submerged.The "Father of Waters" had put a decisive veto on
the project and it had to be given up.Still another plan that failed was
to cut through the Yazoo Pass and approach from the north by way of the
Coldwater, the Tallahatchie, and the Yazoo rivers.He _would_ take
Vicksburg.It was to transfer
his army by land down the west bank of the Mississippi to a point below
the city and approach it from the south and west.This necessitated the
running of the batteries by Porter's fleet--an extremely perilous
enterprise.The army was divided into four corps, commanded respectively
by Sherman, McClernand, McPherson, and Hurlbut.On March 29th, the movement of McClernand from Milliken's Bend
to a point opposite Grand Gulf was begun.He was soon followed by
McPherson and a few weeks later by Sherman.It required a month for the
army, with its heavy artillery, to journey through the swamps and bogs of
Louisiana.While this march was in progress, something far more exciting was taking
place on the river.Porter ran the batteries of Vicksburg with his fleet.After days of preparation the fleet of vessels, protected by cotton bales
and hay about the vital parts of the boats, with heavy logs slung near the
water-line--seven gunboats, the ram _General Price_, three transports, and
various barges were ready for the dangerous journey on the night of April
16th.Silently in the darkness, they left their station near the mouth of
the Yazoo, at a quarter past nine.For an hour and a half all was silence
and expectancy.The bluffs on the east loomed black against the night sky.Suddenly, the flash of musketry fire pierced the darkness.In a few minutes every battery overlooking the river was a center of
spurting flame.A storm of shot and shell was rained upon the passing
vessels.The water of the river
was lashed into foam by the shots and shell from the batteries.The air was filled with flying
missiles.Several houses on the Louisiana shore burst into flame and the
whole river from shore to shore was lighted with vivid distinctness.A
little later, a giant flame leaped from the bosom of the river.It burned to the
water's edge, nearly all its crew escaping to other vessels.Grant
described the scene as "magnificent, but terrible"; Sherman pronounced it
"truly sublime."By three in the morning, the fleet was below the city and ready to
cooperate with the army.One vessel had been destroyed, several others
were crippled; thirteen men had been wounded, but Grant had the assistance
he needed.About a week later, six more transports performed the same feat
and ran the batteries; each had two barges laden with forage and rations
in tow.Grant's next move was to transfer the army across the river and to secure
a base of supplies.There, on the bluff, was Grand Gulf, a tempting spot.But the Confederate guns showed menacingly over the brow of the hill.After a fruitless bombardment by the fleet on April 29th, it was decided
that a more practical place to cross the river must be sought below.Meanwhile, Sherman was ordered by his chief to advance upon the formidable
Haynes' Bluff, on the Yazoo River, some miles above the scene of his
repulse in the preceding December.The message had said, "Make a
demonstration on Haynes' Bluff, and make all the _show_ possible."Sherman's transports, and three of Porter's gunboats, were closely
followed by the Confederate soldiers who had been stationed at the series
of defenses on the range of hills, and when they arrived at Snyder's Mill,
just below Haynes' Bluff, on April 30th, General Hebert and several
Louisiana regiments were awaiting them.On that day and the next the
Confederates fiercely engaged the Union fleet and troops, and on May 2d
Sherman withdrew his forces to the western bank of the Mississippi and
hastened to Grant.The Confederates
had been prevented from sending reenforcements to Grand Gulf, and Grant's
crossing was greatly facilitated.The fleet passed the batteries of Grand Gulf and stopped at Bruinsburg,
six miles below.A landing was soon made, the army taken across on April
30th, and a march to Port Gibson, twelve miles inland, was begun.General
Bowen, Confederate commander at Grand Gulf, came out and offered battle.He was greatly outnumbered, but his troops fought gallantly throughout
most of the day, May 1st, before yielding the field.Port Gibson was then
occupied by the Union army, and Grand Gulf, no longer tenable, was
abandoned by the Confederates.Grant now prepared for a campaign into the interior of Mississippi.His
first intention was to cooperate with General Banks in the capture of Port
Hudson, after which they would move together upon Vicksburg.But hearing
that Banks would not arrive for ten days, Grant decided that he would
proceed to the task before him without delay.His army at that time
numbered about forty-three thousand.That under Pemberton probably forty
thousand, while there were fifteen thousand Confederate troops at Jackson,
Mississippi, soon to be commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, who was
hastening to that capital.The Federal leader now determined on the bold plan of making a dash into
the interior of Mississippi, beating Johnston and turning on Pemberton
before their forces could be joined.This campaign is pronounced the most
brilliant in the Civil War.It was truly Napoleonic in conception and
execution.Grant knew that his base of supplies at Grand Gulf would be cut
off by Pemberton as soon as he moved away from it.He decided, therefore,
against the advice of his generals, to abandon his base altogether.With a few days'
rations in their haversacks the troops were to make a dash that would
possibly take several weeks into the heart of a hostile country.When General Halleck heard of Grant's daring
scheme he wired the latter from Washington, ordering him to move his army
down the river and cooperate with Banks.Fortunately, this order was
received too late to interfere with Grant's plans.As soon as Sherman's divisions joined the main army the march was begun,
on May 7th.An advance of this character must be made with the greatest
celerity and Grant's army showed amazing speed.McPherson, who commanded
the right wing, proceeded toward Jackson by way of Raymond and at the
latter place encountered five thousand Confederates, on May 12th, who
blocked his way and were prepared for fight.McPherson was completely successful and the Confederates
hastened to join their comrades in Jackson.He moved on toward Jackson, and as the last of his
command left Raymond the advance of Sherman's corps reached it.That
night, May 13th, Grant ordered McPherson and Sherman to march upon Jackson
next morning by different roads, while McClernand was held in the rear
near enough to reenforce either in case of need.The rain fell in torrents
that night and, as Grant reported, in places the water was a foot deep in
the road.At eleven o'clock
in the morning of the 14th, a concerted attack was made on the capital of
Mississippi.A few hours' brisk fighting concluded this act of the drama,
and the Stars and Stripes were unfurled on the State capitol.Among the
spoils were seventeen heavy guns.That night, Grant slept in the house
which Johnston had occupied the night before.Meantime, Johnston had ordered Pemberton to detain Grant by attacking him
in the rear.But Pemberton considered it more advisable to move toward
Grand Gulf to separate Grant from his base of supplies, not knowing that
Grant had abandoned his base.And now, with Johnston's army scattered,
Grant left Sherman to burn bridges and military factories, and to tear up
the railroads about Jackson while he turned fiercely on Pemberton.McPherson's corps took the lead.Grant called on McClernand to follow
without delay.Then, hearing that Pemberton was marching toward him, he
called on Sherman to hasten from Jackson.At Champion's Hill (Baker's
Creek) Pemberton stood in the way, with eighteen thousand men.The battle was soon in progress--the heaviest of the campaign.It
continued for seven or eight hours.The Confederates were defeated with a
loss of nearly all their artillery and about half their force, including
four thousand men who were cut off from the main army and failed to rejoin
it.On the banks of the Big Black River, a few miles westward, the
Confederates made another stand, and here the fifth battle of the
investment of Vicksburg took place.The
Confederates suffered heavy losses and the remainder hastened to the
defenses of Vicksburg.They had set fire to the bridge across the Big
Black, and Grant's army was detained for a day--until the Confederates
were safely lodged in the city.The Federal army now invested Vicksburg, occupying the surrounding hills.It was May 18th when the remarkable campaign to reach Vicksburg came to an
end.In eighteen days, the army had marched one hundred and eighty miles
through a hostile country, fought and won five battles, captured a State
capital, had taken twenty-seven heavy cannon and sixty field-pieces, and
had slain or wounded six thousand men and captured as many more.As Grant
and Sherman rode out on the hill north of the city, the latter broke into
enthusiastic admiration of his chief, declaring that up to that moment he
had felt no assurance of success, and pronouncing the campaign one of the
greatest in history.The great problem of investing Vicksburg was solved at last.Around the
doomed city gleamed the thousands of bayonets of the Union army.The
inhabitants and the army that had fled to it as a city of refuge were
penned in.But the Confederacy was not to yield without a stubborn
resistance.On May 19th, an advance was made on the works and the
besieging lines drew nearer and tightened their coils.Three days later,
on May 22nd, Grant ordered a grand assault by his whole army.The troops,
flushed with their victories of the past three weeks, were eager for the
attack.All the corps commanders set their watches by Grant's in order to
begin the assault at all points at the same moment--ten o'clock in the
morning.At the appointed time, the cannon from the encircling lines burst
forth in a deafening roar.Then came the answering thunders from the
mortar-boats on the Louisiana shore and from the gunboats anchored beneath
the bluff.The gunboats' fire was answered from within the bastions
protecting the city.The opening of the heavy guns on the land side was
followed by the sharper crackle of musketry--thousands of shots,
indistinguishable in a continuous roll.The men in the Federal lines leaped from their hiding places and ran to
the parapets in the face of a murderous fire from the defenders of the
city, only to be mowed down by hundreds.Others came, crawling over the
bodies of their fallen comrades--now and then they planted their colors on
the battlements of the besieged city, to be cut down by the galling
Confederate fire.Thus it continued hour after hour, until the coming of
darkness.The Union loss was about three thousand
brave men; the Confederate loss was probably not much over five hundred.Grant had made a fearful sacrifice; he was paying a high price but he had
a reason for so doing--Johnston with a reenforcing army was threatening
him in the rear; by taking Vicksburg at this time he could have turned on
Johnston, and could have saved the Government sending any more Federal
troops; and, to use his own words, it was needed because the men "would
not have worked in the trenches with the same zeal, believing it
unnecessary, as they did after their failure, to carry the enemy's works."On the north side of the city overlooking the river, were the powerful
batteries on Fort Hill, a deadly menace to the Federal troops, and Grant
and Sherman believed that if enfiladed by the gunboats this position could
be carried.At their request Admiral Porter sent the _Cincinnati_ on May
27th to engage the Confederate guns, while four vessels below the town did
the same to the lower defenses.In half an hour five of the
_Cincinnati's_ guns were disabled; and she was in a sinking condition.She
was run toward the shore and sank in three fathoms of water.The army now settled down to a wearisome siege.For six weeks, they
encircled the city with trenches, approaching nearer and nearer to the
defending walls; they exploded mines; they shot at every head that
appeared above the parapets.One by one the defending batteries were
silenced.The sappers slowly worked their way toward the Confederate
ramparts.Miners were busy on both sides burrowing beneath the
fortifications.At three o'clock on the afternoon of June 25th a redoubt
in the Confederate works was blown into the air, breaking into millions of
fragments and disclosing guns, men, and timber.With the mine explosion,
the Federal soldiers before the redoubt began to dash into the opening,
only to meet with a withering fire from an interior parapet which the
Confederates had constructed in anticipation of this event.The carnage
was appalling to behold; and when the soldiers of the Union finally
retired they had learned a costly lesson which withheld them from attack
when another mine was exploded on July 1st.Meantime, let us take a view of the river below and the life of the people
within the doomed city.Far down the river, two hundred and fifty miles
from Vicksburg, was Port Hudson.The place was fortified and held by a
Confederate force under General Gardner.Like Vicksburg, it was besieged
by a Federal army, under Nathaniel P. Banks, of Cedar Mountain fame.On
May 27th, he made a desperate attack on the works and was powerfully aided
by Farragut with his fleet in the river.But aside from dismounting a few
guns and weakening the foe at a still heavier cost to their own ranks, the
Federals were unsuccessful.Again, on June 10th, and still again on the
14th, Banks made fruitless attempts to carry Port Hudson by storm.He
then, like Grant at Vicksburg, settled down to a siege.The defenders of
Port Hudson proved their courage by enduring every hardship.At Vicksburg, during the whole six weeks of the siege, the men in the
trenches worked steadily, advancing the coils about the city.Grant
received reenforcement and before the end of the siege his army numbered
over seventy thousand.Day and night, the roar of artillery continued.From the mortars across the river and from Porter's fleet the shrieking
shells rose in grand parabolic curves, bursting in midair or in the
streets of the city, spreading havoc in all directions.The people of the
city burrowed into the ground for safety.Many whole families lived in
these dismal abodes, their walls of clay being shaken by the roaring
battles that raged above the ground.In one of these dens, sixty-five
people found a home.The food supply ran low, and day by day it became
scarcer.At last, by the end of June, there was nothing to eat except mule
meat and a kind of bread made of beans and corn meal.It was ten o'clock in the morning of July 3d.White flags were seen above
the parapet.A strange quietness rested over the scene
of the long bombardment.On the afternoon of that day, the one, too, on
which was heard the last shot on the battlefield of Gettysburg, Grant and
Pemberton stood beneath an oak tree, in front of McPherson's corps, and
opened negotiations for the capitulation.On the following morning, the
Nation's birthday, about thirty thousand soldiers laid down their arms as
prisoners of war and were released on parole.The losses from May 1st to
the surrender were about ten thousand on each side.Three days later, at Port Hudson, a tremendous cheer arose from the
besieging army.The Confederates within the defenses were at a loss to
know the cause.Then some one shouted the news, "Vicksburg has
surrendered!"Port Hudson could not hope to stand alone; the greater
fortress had fallen.Two days later, July 9th, the gallant garrison, worn
and weary with the long siege, surrendered to General Banks.The whole
course of the mighty Mississippi was now under the Stars and Stripes.[Illustration: BEFORE VICKSBURG]

The close-set mouth, squared shoulders and lowering brow in this
photograph of Grant, taken in December, 1862, tell the story of the
intensity of his purpose while he was advancing upon Vicksburg--only to be
foiled by Van Dorn's raid on his line of communications at Holly Springs.His grim expression and determined jaw betokened no respite for the
Confederates, however.Six months later he marched into the coveted
stronghold.This photograph was taken by James Mullen at Oxford,
Mississippi, in December, 1862, just before Van Dorn's raid balked the
general's plans.[Illustration: AFTER VICKSBURG]

This photograph was taken in the fall of 1863, after the capture of the
Confederacy's Gibraltar had raised Grant to secure and everlasting fame.His attitude is relaxed and his eyebrows no longer mark a straight line
across the grim visage.The right brow is slightly arched with an almost
jovial expression.But the jaw is no less vigorous and determined, and the
steadfast eyes seem to be peering into that future which holds more
victories.He still has Chattanooga and his great campaigns in the East to
fight and the final magnificent struggle in the trenches at Petersburg.[Illustration: WHERE GRANT'S CAMPAIGN WAS HALTED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The second attempt to capture
Vicksburg originated with Grant.Since he had sprung into fame at Fort
Donelson early in 1862, he had done little to strengthen his reputation;
but to all urgings of his removal Lincoln replied: "I can't spare this
man; he fights."He proposed to push southward through Mississippi to
seize Jackson, the capital.If this could be accomplished, Vicksburg
(fifty miles to the west) would become untenable.At Washington his plan
was overruled to the extent of dividing his forces.Sherman, with a
separate expedition, was to move from Memphis down the Mississippi
directly against Vicksburg.It was Grant's hope that by marching on he
could unite with Sherman in an assault upon this key to the Mississippi.Pushing forward from Grand Junction, sixty miles, Grant reached Oxford
December 5, 1862, but his supplies were still drawn from Columbus,
Kentucky, over a single-track road to Holly Springs, and thence by wagon
over roads which were rapidly becoming impassable.Delay ensued in which
Van Dorn destroyed Federal stores at Holly Springs worth $1,500,000.This
put an end to Grant's advance.In the picture we see an Illinois regiment
guarding some of the 1200 Confederate prisoners taken during the advance
and here confined in the Courthouse.[Illustration: WHERE VICKSBURG'S FATE WAS SEALED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here on May 16, 1863, Grant crowned
his daring maneuver against Vicksburg from the south with complete
success.Once across the river below Grand Gulf, after an easy victory at
Port Gibson, he was joined by Sherman.The army struck out across the
strange country south of the Big Black River and soon had driven
Pemberton's southern outposts across that stream.Grant was now on solid
ground; he had successfully turned the flank of the Confederates and he
grasped the opportunity to strike a telling blow.Pressing forward to
Raymond and Jackson, he captured both, and swept westward to meet the
astounded Pemberton, still vacillating between attempting a junction with
Johnston or attacking Grant in the rear.But Grant, moving with wonderful
precision, prevented either movement.On May 16th a battle ensued which
was most decisive around Champion's Hill.Pemberton was routed and put to
flight, and on the next day the Federals seized the crossings of the Big
Black River.Spiking their guns at Haynes' Bluff, the Confederates retired
into Vicksburg, never to come out again except as prisoners.In eighteen
days from the time he crossed the Mississippi, Grant had gained the
advantage for which the Federals had striven for more than a year at
Vicksburg.[Illustration: THE BRIDGE THE CONFEDERATES BURNED AT BIG BLACK RIVER

men fled with precipitate haste over the dreary swamp to the river and
crossed over and burned the railroad and other bridges just in time to
prevent McClernand from following.The necessary delay was aggravating to
Grant's forces.The rest of the day and night was consumed in building
bridges.Sherman had the only pontoon-train with the army and his bridge
was the first ready at Bridgeport, early in the evening.[Illustration: Vicksburg, taken under fire.COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]THE GATE TO THE MISSISSIPPI

courthouse, the chief landmark during the investment.Here at Vicksburg
the Confederates were making their last brave stand for the possession of
the Mississippi River, that great artery of traffic.If it were wrested
from them the main source of their supplies would be cut off.Pemberton, a
brave and capable officer and a Pennsylvanian by birth, worked
unremittingly for the cause he had espoused.Warned by the early attacks
of General Williams and Admiral Farragut, he had left no stone unturned to
render Vicksburg strongly defended.It had proved impregnable to attack on
the north and east, and the powerful batteries planted on the river-front
could not be silenced by the fleet nor by the guns of the Federals on the
opposite shore.But Grant's masterful maneuver of cutting loose from his
base and advancing from the south had at last out-generaled both Pemberton
and Johnston.Nevertheless, Pemberton stoutly held his defenses.His high
river-battery is photographed below, as it frowned upon the Federals
opposite.[Illustration]

gathered his twenty-one thousand troops to make the last stand for the
saving of the Mississippi to the Confederacy.In the upper picture we see
Fort Castle, one of the strongest defenses of the Confederacy.It had full
sweep of the river; here "Whistling Dick" (one of the most powerful guns
in possession of the South) did deadly work.In the lower picture we see
the fortifications to the east of the town, before which Grant's army was
now entrenching.When Vicksburg had first been threatened in 1862, the
Confederate fortifications had been laid out and work begun on them in
haste with but five hundred spades, many of the soldiers delving with
their bayonets.The sites were so well chosen and the work so well done
that they had withstood attacks for a year.They were to hold out still
longer.By May 18th the Federals had completely invested Vicksburg, and
Grant and Sherman rode out to Haynes' Bluff to view the open river to the
north, down which abundant supplies were now coming for the army.Sherman,
who had not believed that the plan could succeed, frankly acknowledged his
mistake.Sherman, assaulting the
fortifications of Vicksburg, the next day, was repulsed.A second attack,
on the 22d, failed and on the 25th Grant settled down to starve Pemberton
out.[Illustration]


[Illustration: THE WORK OF THE BESIEGERS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Battery Sherman, on the Jackson Road, before Vicksburg.Settling down to a
siege did not mean idleness for Grant's army.Fortifications had to be
opposed to the formidable one of the Confederates and a constant
bombardment kept up to silence their guns, one by one.It was to be a
drawn-out duel in which Pemberton, hoping for the long-delayed relief from
Johnston, held out bravely against starvation and even mutiny.For twelve
miles the Federal lines stretched around Vicksburg, investing it to the
river bank, north and south.More than eighty-nine battery positions were
constructed by the Federals.Battery Sherman was exceptionally well
built--not merely revetted with rails or cotton-bales and floored with
rough timber, as lack of proper material often made necessary.Gradually
the lines were drawn closer and closer as the Federals moved up their guns
to silence the works that they had failed to take in May.At the time of
the surrender Grant had more than 220 guns in position, mostly of heavy
caliber.By the 1st of July besieged and besiegers faced each other at a
distance of half-pistol shot.Starving and ravaged by disease, the
Confederates had repelled repeated attacks which depleted their forces,
while Grant, reenforced to three times their number, was showered with
supplies and ammunition that he might bring about the long-delayed victory
which the North had been eagerly awaiting since Chancellorsville.[Illustration: INVESTING BY INCHES

sapping and mining, which finally resulted in the wrecking of the fort so
gallantly defended by the veterans of the Third Louisiana.As the Federal
lines crept up, the men working night and day were forced to live in
burrows.They became proficient in such gopher work as the picture shows.Up to the "White House" (Shirley's) the troops could be marched in
comparative safety, but a short distance beyond they were exposed to the
Confederate sharpshooters, who had only rifles and muskets to depend on;
their artillery had long since been silenced.Near this house was
constructed "Coonskin's" Tower; it was built of railway iron and
cross-ties under the direction of Second Lieutenant Henry C. Foster, of
Company B, Twenty-third Indiana.A backwoodsman and dead-shot, he was
particularly active in paying the Confederate sharpshooters in their own
coin.He habitually wore a cap of raccoon fur, which gave him his nickname
and christened the tower, from which the interior of the Confederate works
could be seen.[Illustration: THE FIRST MONUMENT AT THE MEETING PLACE]

Independence Day, 1863, was a memorable anniversary of the nation's birth;
it brought to the anxious North the momentous news that Meade had won at
Gettysburg and that Vicksburg had fallen in the West.The marble shaft in
the picture was erected to mark the spot where Grant and Pemberton met on
July 3d to confer about the surrender.Under a tree, within a few hundred
feet of the Confederate lines, Grant greeted his adversary as an old
acquaintance.They had fought in the same division for a time in the
Mexican War.Each spoke but two sentences as to the surrender, for Grant
lived up to the nickname he gained at Donelson, and Pemberton's pride was
hurt.The former comrades walked and talked awhile on other things, and
then returned to their lines.Next day the final terms were arranged by
correspondence, and the Confederates marched out with colors flying; they
stacked their arms and, laying their colors upon them, marched back into
the city to be paroled.Those who signed the papers not to fight until
exchanged numbered 29,391.The tree where the commanders met was soon
carried away, root and branch, by relic-hunters.Subsequently the monument
which replaced it was chipped gradually into bits, and in 1866 a
64-pounder cannon took its place as a permanent memorial.[Illustration: VICKSBURG IN POSSESSION OF THE FEDERALS

In the picture the "Silver Lake" is lying off Vicksburg after its fall.While Admiral Porter was busy attacking Vicksburg with the Mississippi
squadron, Lieutenant-Commander Le Roy Fitch, with a few small gunboats,
was actively patrolling the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers.It was soon
seen that the hold upon Tennessee and Kentucky gained by the Federals by
the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson would be lost without adequate
assistance from the navy, and Admiral Porter was authorized to purchase
small light-draft river steamers and add them to Fitch's flotilla as
rapidly as they could be converted into gunboats.One of the first to be
completed was the "Silver Lake."The little stern-wheel steamer first
distinguished herself on February 3, 1863, at Dover, Tennessee, where she
(with Fitch's flotilla) assisted in routing 4,500 Confederates, who were
attacking the Federals at that place.The little vessel continued to
render yeoman's service with the other gunboats, ably assisted by General
A. W. Ellet's marine brigade.[Illustration]

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The Levee at Vicksburg, February, 1864.For seven months the Federals had
been in possession of the city, and the Mississippi--now open through its
entire course--cut off the struggling Confederacy in the East from the
South and Southwest, the storehouses of their resources and their main
dependence in continuing the struggle.But even such a blow as this,
coming on top of Gettysburg, did not force the brave people of the South
to give up the struggle.In the picture the only remaining warlike signs
are the tents on the opposite shore.But on both sides of the river the
Confederates were still desperately striving to reunite their territory.In the East another year and more of the hardest kind of fighting was
ahead; another severing in twain of the South was inevitable before peace
could come, and before the muskets could be used to shoot the crows, and
before their horses could plough the neglected fields.WITHIN THE PARAPET AT PORT HUDSON IN THE SUMMER OF 1863

These fortifications withstood every attack of Banks' powerful army from
May 24 to July 9, 1863.Like Vicksburg, Port Hudson could be reduced only
by a weary siege.These pictures, taken within the fortifications, show in
the distance the ground over which the investing army approached to the
two unsuccessful grand assaults they made upon the Confederate defenders.A continuous line of parapet,
equally strong, had been thrown up for the defense of Port Hudson,
surrounding the town for a distance of three miles and more, each end
terminating on the riverbank.Four powerful forts were located at the
salients, and the line throughout was defended by thirty pieces of field
artillery.Brigadier-General Beall, who commanded the post in 1862,
constructed these works.Major-General Frank Gardner succeeded him in
command at the close of the year.[Illustration: THE WELL-DEFENDED WORKS]

[Illustration: CONFEDERATE FORTIFICATIONS BEFORE PORT HUDSON]

Gardner was behind these defenses with a garrison of about seven thousand
when Banks approached Port Hudson for the second time on May 24th.Gardner
was under orders to evacuate the place and join his force to that of
Johnston at Jackson, Mississippi, but the courier who brought the order
arrived at the very hour when Banks began to bottle up the Confederates.On the morning of May 25th Banks drove in the Confederate skirmishers and
outposts and, with an army of thirty thousand, invested the fortifications
from the eastward.At 10 A.M., after an artillery duel of more than four
hours, the Federals advanced to the assault of the works.Fighting in a
dense forest of magnolias, amid thick undergrowth and among ravines choked
with felled timber, the progress of the troops was too slow for a telling
attack.The battle has been described as "a gigantic bushwhack."The
Federals at the center reached the ditch in front of the Confederate works
but were driven off.It had cost
Banks nearly two thousand men.[Illustration: THE GUN THAT FOOLED THE FEDERALS]

A "Quaker gun" that was mounted by the Confederates in the fortifications
on the bluff at the river-front before Port Hudson.This gun was hewn out
of a pine log and mounted on a carriage, and a black ring was painted
around the end facing the river.Throughout the siege it was mistaken by
the Federals for a piece of real ordnance.To such devices as this the
beleaguered garrison was compelled constantly to resort in order to
impress the superior forces investing Port Hudson with the idea that the
position they sought to capture was formidably defended.Port Hudson was not again attacked from the river after the
passing of Farragut's two ships.[Illustration: WITHIN "THE CITADEL"

second effort to capture the position.The only result was simply to

THE FUTURE ADMIRAL AS CIVIL WAR LIEUTENANT

In the fight with the batteries at Port Hudson, March 14, 1863, Farragut,
in the "Hartford" lashed to the "Albatross," got by, but the fine old
consort of the "Hartford," the "Mississippi," went down--her gunners
fighting to the last.Farragut, in anguish, could see her enveloped in
flames lighting up the river.She had grounded under the very guns of a
battery, and not until actually driven off by the flames did her men
leave her.When the "Mississippi" grounded, the shock threw her
lieutenant-commander into the river, and in confusion he swam toward the
shore; then, turning about, he swam back to his ship.Captain Smith thus
writes in his report: "I consider that I should be neglecting a most
important duty should I omit to mention the coolness of my executive
officer, Mr.Dewey, and the steady, fearless, and gallant manner in which
the officers and men of the 'Mississippi' defended her, and the orderly
and quiet manner in which she was abandoned after being thirty-five
minutes aground under the fire of the enemy's batteries.There was no
confusion in embarking the crew, and the only noise was from the enemy's
cannon."Lieutenant-Commander George Dewey, here mentioned at the age of
26, was to exemplify in Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, the lessons he was
learning from Farragut.[Illustration]

DURING THE FAMOUS ADDRESS IN DEDICATION OF THE CEMETERY

The most important American address is brief: "Fourscore and seven years
ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in
liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.We are met on a
great battlefield of that war.We have come to dedicate a portion of that
field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that
that nation might live.It is altogether fitting and proper that we should
do this.But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
we cannot hallow this ground.The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or
detract.The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here,
but it can never forget what they did here.It is for us, the living,
rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought
here have thus far so nobly advanced.It is rather for us to be here
dedicated to the great task remaining before us;--that from these honored
dead, we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the
last full measure of devotion;--that we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have
a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the earth."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG--THE HIGH-WATER MARK OF THE CIVIL WAR


The military operations of the American Civil War were carried on for the
most part south of the Mason and Dixon line; but the greatest and most
famous of the battles was fought on the soil of the old Keystone State,
which had given birth to the Declaration of Independence and to the
Constitution of the United States.Gettysburg is a quiet hamlet, nestling among the hills of Adams County,
and in 1863 contained about fifteen hundred inhabitants.It had been
founded in 1780 by James Gettys, who probably never dreamed that his name
thus given to the village would, through apparently accidental
circumstances, become famous in history for all time.The hills immediately around Gettysburg are not rugged or precipitous;
they are little more than gentle swells of ground, and many of them were
covered with timber when the hosts of the North and the legions of the
South fought out the destiny of the American republic on those memorable
July days in 1863.Lee's army was flushed with victory after Chancellorsville and was
strengthened by the memory of Fredericksburg.Southern hopes were high
after Hooker's defeat on the Rappahannock, in May, 1863, and public
opinion was unanimous in demanding an invasion of Northern soil.On the
other hand, the Army of the Potomac, under its several leaders, had met
with continual discouragement, and, with all its patriotism and valor, its
two years' warfare showed but few bright pages to cheer the heart of the
war-broken soldier, and to inspire the hopes of the anxious public in the
North.Leaving General Stuart with ten thousand cavalry and a part of Hill's
corps to prevent Hooker from pursuing, Lee crossed the Potomac early in
June, 1863, concentrated his army at Hagerstown, Maryland, and prepared
for a campaign in Pennsylvania, with Harrisburg as the objective.His army
was organized in three corps, under the respective commands of Longstreet,
Ewell, and A. P. Hill.Lee had divided his army so as to approach
Harrisburg by different routes and to assess the towns along the way for
large sums of money.Late in June, he was startled by the intelligence
that Stuart had failed to detain Hooker, and that the Federals had crossed
the Potomac and were in hot pursuit.Lee was quick to see that his plans must be changed.He knew that to
continue his march he must keep his army together to watch his pursuing
antagonist, and that such a course in this hostile country would mean
starvation, while the willing hands of the surrounding populace would
minister to the wants of his foe.Again, if he should scatter his forces
that they might secure the necessary supplies, the parts would be attacked
singly and destroyed.Lee saw, therefore, that he must abandon his
invasion of the North or turn upon his pursuing foe and disable him in
order to continue his march.But that foe was a giant of strength and
courage, more than equal to his own; and the coming together of two such
forces in a mighty death-struggle meant that a great battle must be
fought, a greater battle than this Western world had hitherto known.The Army of the Potomac had again changed leaders, and George Gordon Meade
was now its commander.Hooker, after a dispute with Halleck, resigned his
leadership, and Meade, the strongest of the corps commanders, was
appointed in his place, succeeding him on June 28th.The two great
armies--Union and Confederate--were scattered over portions of Maryland
and southern Pennsylvania.Both were marching northward, along almost
parallel lines.The Confederates were gradually pressing toward the east,
while the Federals were marching along a line eastward of that followed by
the Confederates.The new commander of the Army of the Potomac was keeping
his forces interposed between the legions of Lee and the Federal capital,
and watching for an opportunity to force the Confederates to battle where
the Federals would have the advantage of position.It was plain that they
must soon come together in a gigantic contest; but just where the shock of
battle would take place was yet unknown.Meade had ordered a general
movement toward Harrisburg, and General Buford was sent with four thousand
cavalry to intercept the Confederate advance guard.On the night of June 30th Buford encamped on a low hill, a mile west of
Gettysburg, and here on the following morning the famous battle had its
beginning.On the morning of July 1st the two armies were still scattered, the
extremes being forty miles apart.But General Reynolds, with two corps of
the Union army, was but a few miles away, and was hastening to Gettysburg,
while Longstreet and Hill were approaching from the west.Buford opened
the battle against Heth's division of Hill's corps.Reynolds soon joined
Buford, and three hours before noon the battle was in progress on Seminary
Ridge.Reynolds rode out to his fighting-lines on the ridge, and while
placing his troops, a little after ten o'clock in the morning, he received
a sharpshooter's bullet in the brain.John F. Reynolds, who had been promoted for gallantry at Buena Vista
in the Mexican War, was one of the bravest and ablest generals of the
Union army.No casualty of the war brought more widespread mourning to the
North than the death of Reynolds.But even this calamity could not stay the fury of the battle.By one
o'clock both sides had been greatly reenforced, and the battle-line
extended north of the town from Seminary Ridge to the bank of Rock Creek.Here for hours the roar of the battle was unceasing.About the middle of
the afternoon a breeze lifted the smoke that had enveloped the whole
battle-line in darkness, and revealed the fact that the Federals were
being pressed back toward Gettysburg.General Carl Schurz, who after
Reynolds' death directed the extreme right near Rock Creek, leaving nearly
half of his men dead or wounded on the field, retreated toward Cemetery
Hill, and in passing through the town the Confederates pursued and
captured a large number of the remainder.The left wing, now unable to
hold its position owing to the retreat of the right, was also forced back,
and it, too, took refuge on Cemetery Hill, which had been selected by
General O. O. Howard; and the first day's fight was over.It was several
hours before night, and had the Southerners known of the disorganized
condition of the Union troops, they might have pursued and captured a
large part of the army.Meade, who was still some miles from the field,
hearing of the death of Reynolds, had sent Hancock to take general command
until he himself should arrive.Hancock had ridden at full speed and arrived on the field between three
and four o'clock in the afternoon.His presence soon brought order out of
chaos.His superb bearing, his air of confidence, his promise of heavy
reenforcements during the night, all tended to inspire confidence and to
renew hope in the ranks of the discouraged army.Had this day ended the
affair at Gettysburg, the usual story of the defeat of the Army of the
Potomac would have gone forth to the world.Only the advance portions of
both armies had been engaged; and yet the battle had been a formidable
one.A great commander had fallen, and the rank
and file had suffered the fearful loss of ten thousand men.Meade reached the scene late in the night, and chose to make this field,
on which the advance of both armies had accidentally met, the place of a
general engagement.Lee had come to the same decision, and both called on
their outlying legions to make all possible speed to Gettysburg.Before
morning, nearly all the troops of both armies had reached the field.The
Union army rested with its center on Cemetery Ridge, with its right thrown
around to Culp's Hill and its left extended southward toward the rocky
peak called Round Top.The Confederate army, with its center on Seminary
Ridge, its wings extending from beyond Rock Creek on the north to a point
opposite Round Top on the south, lay in a great semi-circle, half
surrounding the Army of the Potomac.First,
"Stonewall" Jackson was gone, and second, Stuart was absent with his ten
thousand cavalry.Furthermore, Meade was on the defensive, and had the
advantage of occupying the inner ring of the huge half circle.Thus lay
the two mighty hosts, awaiting the morning, and the carnage that the day
was to bring.It seemed that the fate of the Republic was here to be
decided, and the people of the North and the South watched with breathless
eagerness for the decision about to be made at Gettysburg.The dawn of July 2d betokened a beautiful summer day in southern
Pennsylvania.The hours of the night had been spent by the two armies in
marshaling of battalions and maneuvering of corps and divisions, getting
into position for the mighty combat of the coming day.But, when morning
dawned, both armies hesitated, as if unwilling to begin the task of
bloodshed.They remained inactive, except for a stray shot here and there,
until nearly four o'clock in the afternoon.The fighting on this second day was chiefly confined to the two extremes,
the centers remaining comparatively inactive.Longstreet commanded the
Confederate right, and opposite him on the Union left was General Daniel
E. Sickles.The Confederate left wing, under Ewell, was opposite Slocum
and the Union right stationed on Culp's Hill.The plan of General Meade had been to have the corps commanded by General
Sickles connect with that of Hancock and extend southward near the base of
the Round Tops.Sickles found this ground low and disadvantageous as a
fighting-place.In his front he saw the high ground along the ridge on the
side of which the peach orchard was situated, and advanced his men to this
position, placing them along the Emmitsburg road, and back toward the
Trostle farm and the wheat-field, thus forming an angle at the peach
orchard.The left flank of Hancock's line now rested far behind the right
flank of Sickles' forces.The Third Corps was alone in its position in
advance of the Federal line.The Confederate troops later marched along
Sickles' front so that Longstreet's corps overlapped the left wing of the
Union army.The Northerners grimly watched the bristling cannon and the
files of men that faced them across the valley, as they waited for the
battle to commence.The boom of cannon from Longstreet's batteries announced the beginning of
the second day's battle.Lee had ordered Longstreet to attack Sickles in
full force.The fire was quickly answered by the Union troops, and before
long the fight extended from the peach orchard through the wheatfield and
along the whole line to the base of Little Round Top.The musketry
commenced with stray volleys here and there--then more and faster, until
there was one continuous roar, and no ear could distinguish one shot from
another.Longstreet swept forward in a magnificent line of battle, a mile
and a half long.He pressed back the Union infantry, and was seriously
threatening the artillery.At the extreme left, close to the Trostle house, Captain John Bigelow
commanded the Ninth Battery, Massachusetts Light Artillery.He was ordered
to hold his position at all hazards until reenforced.With double charges
of grape and canister, again and again he tore great gaps in the advancing
line, but it re-formed and pressed onward until the men in gray reached
the muzzles of the Federal guns.Again Bigelow fired, but the heroic band
had at last to give way to the increased numbers of the attack, which
finally resulted in a hand-to-hand struggle with a Mississippi regiment.Bigelow was wounded, and twenty-eight of his hundred and four men were
left on the bloody field, while he lost sixty-five out of eighty-eight
horses, and four of six guns.Such was one of many deeds of heroism
enacted at Gettysburg.But the most desperate struggle of the day was the fight for the
possession of Little Round Top.Just before the action began General Meade
sent his chief engineer, General G. K. Warren, to examine conditions on
the Union left.The battle was raging in the peach orchard when he came to
Little Round Top.It was unoccupied at the time, and Warren quickly saw
the great importance of preventing its occupation by the Confederates, for
the hill was the key to the whole battle-ground west and south of Cemetery
Ridge.Before long, the engineer saw Hood's division of Longstreet's corps
moving steadily toward the hill, evidently determined to occupy it.Had
Hood succeeded, the result would have been most disastrous to the Union
army, for the Confederates could then have subjected the entire Union
lines on the western edge of Cemetery Ridge to an enfilading fire.Warren
and a signal officer seized flags and waved them, to deceive the
Confederates as to the occupation of the height.Sykes' corps, marching to
the support of the left, soon came along, and Warren, dashing down the
side of the hill to meet it, caused the brigade under Colonel Vincent and
a part of that under General Weed to be detached, and these occupied the
coveted position.Hazlett's battery was dragged by hand up the rugged
<DW72> and planted on the summit.Meantime Hood's forces had come up the hill, and were striving at the very
summit; and now occurred one of the most desperate hand-to-hand conflicts
of the war--in which men forgot that they were human and tore at each
other like wild beasts.The opposing forces, not having time to reload,
charged each other with bayonets--men assaulted each other with clubbed
muskets--the Blue and the Gray grappled in mortal combat and fell dead,
side by side.The privates in the front ranks fought their way onward
until they fell, the officers sprang forward, seized the muskets from the
hands of the dying and the dead, and continued the combat.The furious
struggle continued for half an hour, when Hood's forces gave way and were
pressed down the hillside.But they rallied and advanced again by way of a
ravine on the left, and finally, after a most valiant charge, were driven
back at the point of the bayonet.Little Round Top was saved to the Union army, but the cost was appalling.The hill was covered with hundreds of the slain.Scores of the Confederate
sharpshooters had taken position among the crevasses in the Devil's Den,
where they could overlook the position on Little Round Top, and their
unerring aim spread death among the Federal officers and gunners.Colonel
O'Rourke and General Vincent were dead.General Weed was dying; and, as
Hazlett was stooping to receive Weed's last message, a sharpshooter's
bullet laid him--dead--across the body of his chief.During this attack, and for some hours thereafter, the battle continued in
the valley below on a grander scale and with demon-like fury.Sickles' whole line was pressed back to the base
of the hill from which it had advanced in the morning.Sickles' leg was
shattered by a shell, necessitating amputation, while scores of his brave
officers, and thousands of his men, lay on the field of battle when the
struggle ceased at nightfall.This valley has been appropriately named the
"Valley of Death."Before the close of this main part of the second day's battle, there was
another clash of arms, fierce but of short duration, at the other extreme
of the line.Lee had ordered Ewell to attack Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill
on the north, held by Slocum, who had been weakened by the sending of a
large portion of the Twelfth Corps to the assistance of the left wing.Ewell had three divisions, two of which were commanded by Generals Early
and Johnson.It was nearly sunset when he sent Early to attack Cemetery
Hill.Early was repulsed after an hour's bloody and desperate hand-to-hand
fight, in which muskets and bayonets, rammers, clubs, and stones were
used.Johnson's attack on Culp's Hill was more successful.After a severe
struggle of two or three hours General Greene, who alone of the Twelfth
Corps remained on the right, succeeded, after reenforcement, in driving
the right of Johnson's division away from its entrenchments, but the left
had no difficulty in taking possession of the abandoned works of Geary and
Ruger, now gone to Round Top and Rock Creek to assist the left wing.Thus closed the second day's battle at Gettysburg.The harvest of death
had been frightful.The Union loss during the two days had exceeded twenty
thousand men; the Confederate loss was nearly equal.The Confederate army
had gained an apparent advantage in penetrating the Union breastworks on
Culp's Hill.But the Union lines, except on Culp's Hill, were unbroken.On
the night of July 2d, Lee and his generals held a council of war and
decided to make a grand final assault on Meade's center the following day.His counsel was that
Lee withdraw to the mountains, compel Meade to follow, and then turn and
attack him.But Lee was encouraged by the arrival of Pickett's division
and of Stuart's cavalry, and Longstreet's objections were overruled.Meade
and his corps commanders had met and made a like decision--that there
should be a fight to the death at Gettysburg.That night a brilliant July moon shed its luster upon the ghastly field on
which thousands of men lay, unable to rise.Their last battle was over, and their spirits had fled to the great
Beyond.But there were great numbers, torn and gashed with shot and shell,
who were still alive and calling for water or for the kindly touch of a
helping hand.Here and there in the
moonlight little rescuing parties were seeking out whom they might succor.They carried many to the improvised hospitals, where the surgeons worked
unceasingly and heroically, and many lives were saved.All through the night the Confederates were massing artillery along the
crest of Seminary Ridge.The sound horses were carefully fed and watered,
while those killed or disabled were replaced by others.The ammunition was
replenished and the guns were placed in favorable positions and made ready
for their work of destruction.On the other side, the Federals were diligently laboring in the moonlight,
and ere the coming of the day they had planted batteries on the brow of
the hill above the town as far as Little Round Top.The coming of the
morning revealed the two parallel lines of cannon, a mile apart, which
signified only too well the story of what the day would bring forth.The people of Gettysburg, which lay almost between the armies, were
awakened on that fateful morning--July 3, 1863--by the roar of artillery
from Culp's Hill, around the bend toward Rock Creek.This knoll in the
woods had, as we have seen, been taken by Johnson's men the night before.When Geary and Ruger returned and found their entrenchments occupied by
the Confederates they determined to recapture them in the morning, and
began firing their guns at daybreak.Seven hours of fierce bombardment and
daring charges were required to regain them.Every rod of space was
disputed at the cost of many a brave man's life.At eleven o'clock this
portion of the Twelfth Corps was again in its old position.But the most desperate onset of the three days' battle was yet to
come--Pickett's charge on Cemetery Ridge--preceded by the heaviest
cannonading ever heard on the American continent.With the exception of the contest at Culp's Hill and a cavalry fight east
of Rock Creek, the forenoon of July 3d passed with only an occasional
exchange of shots at irregular intervals.At noon there was a lull, almost
a deep silence, over the whole field.It was the ominous calm that
precedes the storm.At one o'clock signal guns were fired on Seminary
Ridge, and a few moments later there was a terrific outburst from one
hundred and fifty Confederate guns, and the whole crest of the ridge, for
two miles, was a line of flame.The scores of batteries were soon enveloped in smoke, through which the
flashes of burning powder were incessant.The long line of Federal guns withheld their fire for some minutes, when
they burst forth, answering the thunder of those on the opposite hill.An
eye-witness declares that the whole sky seemed filled with screaming
shells, whose sharp explosions, as they burst in mid-air, with the
hurtling of the fragments, formed a running accompaniment to the deep,
tremendous roar of the guns.Many of the Confederate shots went wild, passing over the Union army and
plowing up the earth on the other side of Cemetery Ridge.But others were
better aimed and burst among the Federal batteries, in one of which
twenty-seven out of thirty-six horses were killed in ten minutes.The
Confederate fire seemed to be concentrated upon one point between Cemetery
Ridge and Little Round Top, near a clump of scrub oaks.Here the batteries
were demolished and men and horses were slain by scores.The spot has been
called "Bloody Angle."The Federal fire proved equally accurate and the destruction on Seminary
Ridge was appalling.For nearly two hours the hills shook with the
tremendous cannonading, when it gradually slackened and ceased.The Union
army now prepared for the more deadly charge of infantry which it felt was
sure to follow.As the cannon smoke drifted away from between
the lines fifteen thousand of Longstreet's corps emerged in grand columns
from the wooded crest of Seminary Ridge under the command of General
Pickett on the right and General Pettigrew on the left.Longstreet had
planned the attack with a view to passing around Round Top, and gaining it
by flank and reverse attack, but Lee, when he came upon the scene a few
moments after the final orders had been given, directed the advance to be
made straight toward the Federal main position on Cemetery Ridge.The charge was one of the most daring in warfare.The distance to the
Federal lines was a mile.For half the distance the troops marched gayly,
with flying banners and glittering bayonets.Then came the burst of
Federal cannon, and the Confederate ranks were torn with exploding shells.Pettigrew's columns began to waver, but the lines re-formed and marched
on.When they came within musket-range, Hancock's infantry opened a
terrific fire, but the valiant band only quickened its pace and returned
the fire with volley after volley.Pettigrew's troops succumbed to the
storm.For now the lines in blue were fast converging.Federal troops from
all parts of the line now rushed to the aid of those in front of Pickett.The batteries which had been sending shell and solid shot changed their
ammunition, and double charges of grape and canister were hurled into the
column as it bravely pressed into the sea of flame.The Confederates came
close to the Federal lines and paused to close their ranks.Each moment
the fury of the storm from the Federal guns increased."Forward," again rang the command along the line of the Confederate front,
and the Southerners dashed on.The first line of the Federals was driven
back.A stone wall behind them gave protection to the next Federal force.Riflemen rose from behind and hurled a
death-dealing volley into the Confederate ranks.A defiant cheer answered
the volley, and the Southerners placed their battle-flags on the ramparts.General Armistead grasped the flag from the hand of a falling bearer, and
leaped upon the wall, waving it in triumph.Almost instantly he fell
among the Federal troops, mortally wounded.General Garnett, leading his
brigade, fell dead close to the Federal line.General Kemper sank,
wounded, into the arms of one of his men.Troops from all directions rushed upon
him.Clubbed muskets and barrel-staves now became weapons of warfare.The
Confederates began surrendering in masses and Pickett ordered a retreat.Yet the energy of the indomitable Confederates was not spent.Several
supporting brigades moved forward, and only succumbed when they
encountered two regiments of Stannard's Vermont brigade, and the fire of
fresh batteries.As the remnant of the gallant division returned to the works on Seminary
Ridge General Lee rode out to meet them.His
features gave no evidence of his disappointment.With hat in hand he
greeted the men sympathetically."It was all my fault," he said."Now help
me to save that which remains."The
losses of the two armies reached fifty thousand, about half on either
side.More than seven thousand men had fallen dead on the field of battle.The tide could rise no higher; from this point the ebb must begin.Not
only here, but in the West the Southern cause took a downward turn; for at
this very hour of Pickett's charge, Grant and Pemberton, a thousand miles
away, stood under an oak tree on the heights above the Mississippi and
arranged for the surrender of Vicksburg.Lee could do nothing but lead his army back to Virginia.The Federals
pursued but feebly.The Union victory was not a very decisive one, but,
supported as it was by the fall of Vicksburg, the moral effect on the
nation and on the world was great.It
required but little prophetic vision to foresee that the Republic would
survive the dreadful shock of arms.[Illustration: THE CRISIS BRINGS FORTH THE MAN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Major-General George Gordon Meade and Staff.Not men, but a man is what
counts in war, said Napoleon; and Lee had proved it true in many a bitter
lesson administered to the Army of the Potomac.At the end of June, 1863,
for the third time in ten months, that army had a new commander.Promptness and caution were equally imperative in that hour.Meade's
fitness for the post was as yet undemonstrated; he had been advanced from
the command of the Fifth Corps three days before the army was to engage in
its greatest battle.Lee must be turned back from Harrisburg and
Philadelphia and kept from striking at Baltimore and Washington, and the
somewhat scattered Army of the Potomac must be concentrated.In the very
first flush of his advancement, Meade exemplified the qualities of sound
generalship that placed his name high on the list of Federal commanders.[Illustration: ROBERT E. LEE IN 1863

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]It was with the gravest misgivings that Lee began his invasion of the
North in 1863.He was too wise a general not to realize that a crushing
defeat was possible.Yet, with Vicksburg already doomed, the effort to win
a decisive victory in the East was imperative in its importance.Magnificent was the courage and fortitude of Lee's maneuvering during that
long march which was to end in failure.Hitherto he had made every one of
his veterans count for two of their antagonists, but at Gettysburg the
odds had fallen heavily against him.Jackson, his resourceful ally, was no
more.Longstreet advised strongly against giving battle, but Lee
unwaveringly made the tragic effort which sacrificed more than a third of
his splendid army.[Illustration: HANCOCK, "THE SUPERB"

1st a foam-flecked charger dashed up Cemetery Hill bearing General
Hancock.He had galloped thirteen miles to take command.Apprised of the
loss of Reynolds, his main dependence, Meade knew that only a man of vigor
and judgment could save the situation.He chose wisely, for Hancock was
one of the best all-round soldiers that the Army of the Potomac had
developed.It was he who re-formed the shattered corps and chose the
position to be held for the decisive struggle.[Illustration: MUTE PLEADERS IN THE CAUSE OF PEACE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, BY PATRIOT PUB.There was little time that could be employed by either side in caring for
those who fell upon the fields of the almost uninterrupted fighting at
Gettysburg.On the morning of the 4th, when Lee began to abandon his
position on Seminary Ridge, opposite the Federal right, both sides sent
forth ambulance and burial details to remove the wounded and bury the dead
in the torrential rain then falling.Under cover of the hazy atmosphere,
Lee was getting his whole army in motion to retreat.Many an unfinished
shallow grave, like the one above, had to be left by the Confederates.In
this lower picture some men of the Twenty-fourth Michigan infantry are
lying dead on the field of battle.This regiment--one of the units of the
Iron Brigade--left seven distinct rows of dead as it fell back from
battle-line to battle-line, on the first day.Three-fourths of its members
were struck down.[Illustration: MEN OF THE IRON BRIGADE]


[Illustration: THE FIRST DAY'S TOLL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The lives laid down by the blue-clad soldiers in the first day's fighting
made possible the ultimate victory at Gettysburg.The stubborn resistance
of Buford's cavalry and of the First and Eleventh Corps checked the
Confederate advance for an entire day.The delay was priceless; it enabled
Meade to concentrate his army upon the heights to the south of Gettysburg,
a position which proved impregnable.To a Pennsylvanian, General John F.
Reynolds, falls the credit of the determined stand that was made that day.Commanding the advance of the army, he promptly went to Buford's support,
bringing up his infantry and artillery to hold back the Confederates.[Illustration: McPHERSON'S WOODS]

At the edge of these woods General Reynolds was killed by a Confederate
sharpshooter in the first vigorous contest of the day.The woods lay
between the two roads upon which the Confederates were advancing from the
west, and General Doubleday (in command of the First Corps) was ordered to
take the position so that the columns of the foe could be enfiladed by the
infantry, while contending with the artillery posted on both roads.The
Iron Brigade under General Meredith was ordered to hold the ground at all
hazards.As they charged, the troops shouted: "If we can't hold it, where
will you find the men who can?"On they swept, capturing General Archer
and many of his Confederate brigade that had entered the woods from the
other side.As Archer passed to the rear, Doubleday, who had been his
classmate at West Point, greeted him with "Good morning![Illustration: FEDERAL DEAD AT GETTYSBURG, JULY 1, 1863

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.All the way from McPherson's Woods back to Cemetery Hill lay the Federal
soldiers, who had contested every foot of that retreat until nightfall.The Confederates were massing so rapidly from the west and north that
there was scant time to bring off the wounded and none for attention to
the dead.There on the field lay the shoes so much needed by the
Confederates, and the grim task of gathering them began.The dead were
stripped of arms, ammunition, caps, and accoutrements as well--in fact, of
everything that would be of the slightest use in enabling Lee's poorly
equipped army to continue the internecine strife.It was one of war's
awful expedients.[Illustration: SEMINARY RIDGE, BEYOND GETTYSBURG]

Along this road the Federals retreated toward Cemetery Hill in the late
afternoon of July 1st.The success of McPherson's Woods was but temporary,
for the Confederates under Hill were coming up in overpowering numbers,
and now Ewell's forces appeared from the north.The first Corps, under
Doubleday, "broken and defeated but not dismayed," fell back, pausing now
and again to fire a volley at the pursuing Confederates.It finally joined
the Eleventh Corps, which had also been driven back to Cemetery Hill.Lee
was on the field in time to watch the retreat of the Federals, and advised
Ewell to follow them up, but Ewell (who had lost 3,000 men) decided upon
discretion.Night fell with the beaten Federals, reinforced by the Twelfth
Corps and part of the Third, facing nearly the whole of Lee's army.[Illustration: IN THE DEVIL'S DEN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Upon this wide, steep hill, about five hundred yards due west of Little
Round Top and one hundred feet lower, was a chasm named by the country
folk "the Devil's Den."When the position fell into the hands of the
Confederates at the end of the second day's fighting, it became the
stronghold of their sharpshooters, and well did it fulfill its name.It
was a most dangerous post to occupy, since the Federal batteries on the
Round Top were constantly shelling it in an effort to dislodge the hardy
riflemen, many of whom met the fate of the one in the picture.Their
deadly work continued, however, and many a gallant officer of the Federals
was picked off during the fighting on the afternoon of the second day.General Vincent was one of the first victims; General Weed fell likewise;
and as Lieutenant Hazlett bent over him to catch his last words, a bullet
through the head prostrated that officer lifeless on the body of his
chief.[Illustration: THE UNGUARDED LINK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Little Round Top, the key to the Federal left at Gettysburg, which they
all but lost on the second day--was the scene of hand-to-hand fighting
rarely equaled since long-range weapons were invented.Twice the
Confederates in fierce conflict fought their way near to this summit, but
were repulsed.Had they gained it, they could have planted artillery which
would have enfiladed the left of Meade's line, and Gettysburg might have
been turned into an overwhelming defeat.Beginning at the right, the
Federal line stretched in the form of a fish-hook, with the barb resting
on Culp's Hill, the center at the bend in the hook on Cemetery Hill, and
the left (consisting of General Sickles' Third Corps) forming the shank to
the southward as far as Round Top.On his own responsibility Sickles had
advanced a portion of his line, leaving Little Round Top unprotected.Upon
this advanced line of Sickles, at the Peach Orchard on the Emmitsburg
road, the Confederates fell in an effort to turn what they supposed to be
Meade's left flank.Only the promptness of General Warren, who discovered
the gap and remedied it in time, saved the key.[Illustration: THE HEIGHT OF THE BATTLE-TIDE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Near this gate to the local cemetery of Gettysburg there stood during the
battle this sign: "All persons found using firearms in these grounds will
be prosecuted with the utmost rigor of the law."Many a soldier must have
smiled grimly at these words, for this gateway became the key of the
Federal line, the very center of the cruelest use of firearms yet seen on
this continent.On the first day Reynolds saw the value of Cemetery Hill
in case of a retreat.Howard posted his reserves here, and Hancock greatly
strengthened the position.One hundred and fifty Confederate guns were
turned against it that last afternoon.In five minutes every man of the
Federals had been forced to cover; for an hour and a half the shells fell
fast, dealing death and laying waste the summer verdure in the little
graveyard.Up to the very guns of the Federals on Cemetery Hill, Pickett
led his devoted troops.At night of the 3d it was one vast
slaughter-field.On this eminence, where thousands were buried, was
dedicated the soldiers' National Cemetery.[Illustration: PICKETT--THE MARSHALL NEY OF GETTYSBURG]

The Now-or-never Charge of Pickett's Men.When the Confederate artillery
opened at one o'clock on the afternoon of July 3d, Meade and his staff
were driven from their headquarters on Cemetery Ridge.Nothing could live
exposed on that hillside, swept by cannon that were being worked as fast
as human hands could work them.It was the beginning of Lee's last effort
to wrest victory from the odds that were against him.Longstreet, on the
morning of the 3d, had earnestly advised against renewing the battle
against the Gettysburg heights.But Lee saw that in this moment the fate
of the South hung in the balance; that if the Army of Northern Virginia
did not win, it would never again become the aggressor.Pickett's
division, as yet not engaged, was the force Lee designated for the
assault; every man was a Virginian, forming a veritable Tenth Legion in
valor.Auxiliary divisions swelled the charging column to 15,000.In the
middle of the afternoon the Federal guns ceased firing.Twice Pickett asked of Longstreet if he should go
forward."Sir, I shall lead my division
forward," said Pickett at last, and the heavy-hearted Longstreet bowed his
head.As the splendid column swept out of the woods and across the plain
the Federal guns reopened with redoubled fury.For a mile Pickett and his
men kept on, facing a deadly greeting of round shot, canister, and the
bullets of Hancock's resolute infantry.It was magnificent--but every one
of Pickett's brigade commanders went down and their men fell by scores and
hundreds around them.A hundred led by Armistead, waving his cap on his
sword-point, actually broke through and captured a battery, Armistead
falling beside a gun.Longstreet had been right
when he said: "There never was a body of fifteen thousand men who could
make that attack successfully."Before the converging Federals the thinned
ranks of Confederates drifted wearily back toward Seminary Ridge.Victory
for the South was not to be.[Illustration: MEADE'S HEADQUARTERS ON CEMETERY RIDGE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: WHERE PICKETT CHARGED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The prelude to Pickett's magnificent charge was a sudden deluge of shells
from 150 long-range Confederate guns trained upon Cemetery Ridge.General
Meade and his staff were instantly driven from their headquarters (already
illustrated) and within five minutes the concentrated artillery fire had
swept every unsheltered position on Cemetery Ridge clear of men.In the
woods, a mile and a half distant, Pickett and his men watched the effect
of the bombardment, expecting the order to "Go Forward" up the <DW72>
(shown in the picture).The Federals had instantly opened with their
eighty available guns, and for three hours the most terrific artillery
duel of the war was kept up.Then the Federal fire slackened, as though
the batteries were silenced.The Confederates' artillery ammunition also
was now low.And at
Longstreet's reluctant nod the commander led his 14,000 Virginians across
the plain in their tragic charge up Cemetery Ridge.[Illustration: GENERAL L. A. ARMISTEAD, C. S.In that historic charge was Armistead, who achieved a momentary victory
and met a hero's death.On across the Emmitsburg road came Pickett's
dauntless brigades, coolly closing up the fearful chasms torn in their
ranks by the canister.Up to the fence held by Hays' brigade dashed the
first gray line, only to be swept into confusion by a cruel enfilading
fire.Then the brigades of Armistead and Garnett moved forward, driving
Hays' brigade back through the batteries on the crest.Despite the
death-dealing bolts on all sides, Pickett determined to capture the guns;
and, at the order, Armistead, leaping the fence and waving his cap on his
sword-point, rushed forward, followed by about a hundred of his men.Up to
the very crest they fought the Federals back, and Armistead, shouting,
"Give them the cold steel, boys!"For a moment the
Confederate flag waved triumphantly over the Federal battery.For a brief
interval the fight raged fiercely at close quarters.Armistead was shot
down beside the gun he had taken, and his men were driven back.Pickett,
as he looked around the top of the ridge he had gained, could see his men
fighting all about with clubbed muskets and even flagstaffs against the
troops that were rushing in upon them from all sides.Flesh and blood
could not hold the heights against such terrible odds, and with a heart
full of anguish Pickett ordered a retreat.The despairing Longstreet,
watching from Seminary Ridge, saw through the smoke the shattered remnants
drift sullenly down the <DW72> and knew that Pickett's glorious but costly
charge was ended.[Illustration: THE MAN WHO HELD THE CENTER

man pictured here (booted and in full uniform, before his headquarters

charge.With four Pennsylvania regiments (the Sixty-Ninth, Seventy-First,
Seventy-Second, and One Hundred and Sixth) of Hancock's Second Corps, Webb
was equal to the emergency.Stirred to great deeds by the example of a
patriotic ancestry, he felt that upon his holding his position depended
the outcome of the day.His front had been the focus of the Confederate
artillery fire.Batteries to right and left of his line were practically
silenced.Young Lieutenant Cushing, mortally wounded, fired the last
serviceable gun and fell dead as Pickett's men came on.Cowan's First New
York Battery on the left of Cushing's used canister on the assailants at
less than ten yards.Webb at the head of the Seventy-Second Pennsylvania
fought back the on-rush, posting a line of slightly wounded in his rear.Webb himself fell wounded but his command checked the assault till Hall's
brilliant charge turned the tide at this point.[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER WITH GENERAL

as the head of a brigade of cavalry distinguished himself at Gettysburg.Later he served with Sheridan in the Shenandoah, won honor at Cedar Creek,
and was brevetted major-general of volunteers on October 19, 1864.Under
Sheridan he participated in the battles of Five Forks, Dinwiddie Court
House, and other important cavalry engagements of Grant's last campaign.[Illustration: SUMTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Searching all history for a parallel, it is impossible to find any
defenses of a beleaguered city that stood so severe a bombardment as did
this bravely defended and never conquered fortress of Sumter, in
Charleston Harbor.It is estimated that about eighty thousand projectiles
were discharged from the fleet and the marsh batteries, and yet
Charleston, with its battered water-front, was not abandoned until all
other Confederate positions along the Atlantic Coast were in Federal hands
and Sherman's triumphant army was sweeping in from the West and South.The
picture shows Sumter from the Confederate Fort Johnson.The powerful
batteries in the foreground played havoc with the Federal fleet whenever
it came down the main ship-channel to engage the forts.Protected by
almost impassable swamps, morasses, and a network of creeks to the
eastward, Fort Johnson held an almost impregnable position; and from its
protection by Cummings' Point, on which was Battery Gregg, the Federal
fleet could not approach nearer than two miles.Could it have been taken
by land assault or reduced by gun-fire, Charleston would have fallen.[Illustration: WHERE SHOT AND SHELL STRUCK SUMTER]

These views show the result of the bombardment from August 17 to 23, 1863.The object was to force the surrender of the fort and thus effect an
entrance into Charleston.The report of Colonel John W. Turner, Federal
chief of artillery runs: "The fire from the breaching batteries upon
Sumter was incessant, and kept up continuously from daylight till dark,
until the evening of the 23d.... The fire upon the gorge had, by the
morning of the 23d, succeeded in destroying every gun upon the parapet of
it.The parapet and ramparts of the gorge were completely demolished for
nearly the entire length of the face, and in places everything was swept
off down to the arches, the _debris_ forming an accessible ramp to the top
of the ruins.Nothing further being gained by a longer fire upon this
face, all the guns were directed this day upon the southeasterly flank,
and continued an incessant fire throughout the day.The demolition of the
fort at the close of the day's firing was complete, so far as its
offensive powers were considered."[Illustration: SOME OF THE 450 SHOT A DAY]

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.So long as the Confederate flag flew over the ramparts of Sumter,
Charleston remained the one stronghold of the South that was firmly held.It was lowered for an evacuation, not a
surrender.The story of Charleston's determined resistance did not end in
triumph for the South, but it did leave behind it a sunset glory, in which
the valor and dash of the Federal attack is paralleled by the heroism and
self-sacrifice of the Confederate defense, in spite of wreck and ruin.[Illustration: SCENE OF THE NIGHT ATTACK ON SUMTER, SEPTEMBER 8, 1863]

The lower picture was taken after the war, when relic-hunters had removed
the shells, and a beacon light had been erected where once stood the
parapet.On September 8, 1863, at the very position in these photographs,
the garrison repelled a bold assault with musketry fire alone, causing the
Federals severe loss.The flag of the Confederacy floated triumphantly
over the position during the whole of the long struggle.Every effort of
the Federals to reduce the crumbling ruins into submission was unavailing.It stood the continual bombardment of ironclads until it was nothing but a
mass of brickdust, but still the gallant garrison held it.It is strange
that despite the awful destruction the loss of lives within the fort was
few.For weeks the bombardment, assisted by the guns of the fleet, tore
great chasms in the parapet.Fort Sumter never fell, but was abandoned
only on the approach of Sherman's army.It had withstood continuous
efforts against it for 587 days.From April, 1863, to September of the
same year, the fortress was garrisoned by the First South Carolina
Artillery, enlisted as regulars.Afterward the garrison was made up of
detachments of infantry from Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.Artillerists also served turns of duty during this period.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: RALLYING THE LINE._Painted by C. D. Graves._

CHICKAMAUGA--THE BLOODIEST CONFLICT IN THE WEST

    In its dimensions and its murderousness the battle of Chickamauga was
    the greatest battle fought by our Western armies, and one of the
    greatest of modern times.In our Civil War it was exceeded only by
    Gettysburg and the Wilderness; in European history we may compare with
    it such battles as Neerwinden, or Malplaquet, or Waterloo.--_John
    Fiske in "The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War."_


The town of Chattanooga, Tennessee, lies in a great bend of the Tennessee
River and within a vast amphitheater of mountains, ranging in a general
southwesterly direction, and traversed at intervals by great depressions
or valleys.These passes form a natural gateway from the mid-Mississippi
valley to the seaboard States.To dislodge the Confederate army under
General Bragg from this natural fortress would remove the last barrier to
the invading Federals, and permit an easy entry upon the plains of
Georgia.The importance of this position was readily apparent to the
Confederate Government, and any approach by the Federal forces toward this
point was almost certain to be met by stubborn resistance.Rosecrans' forward movement from Murfreesboro, in the early summer of
1863, forced Bragg over the Cumberland Mountains and across the Tennessee.The Confederate leader destroyed the railroad bridge at Bridgeport and
entrenched himself in and around Chattanooga.The three Federal corps
under Crittenden, Thomas and McCook crossed the Tennessee without meeting
resistance, and began to endanger Bragg's lines of communication.But on
September 8th, before their moves had been accomplished, Bragg abandoned
his stronghold.Crittenden the next day marched around the north end of
Lookout and entered the town, while Hazen and Wagner crossed over from the
opposite bank of the Tennessee.Rosecrans believed that Bragg was in full retreat toward Rome, Georgia,
and Crittenden, leaving one brigade in Chattanooga, was ordered to pursue.Bragg encouraged his adversary in the belief that he was avoiding an
engagement and sent spies as deserters into the Federal ranks to narrate
the details of his flight.Meanwhile, he was concentrating at Lafayette,
about twenty-five miles south of Chattanooga.Hither General S. B.
Buckner, entirely too weak to cope with Burnside's heavy column
approaching from Kentucky, brought his troops from Knoxville.Breckinridge
and two brigades arrived from Mississippi, while twelve thousand of Lee's
veterans, under Lee's most trusted and illustrious lieutenant, Longstreet,
were hastening from Virginia to add their numbers to Bragg's Army of
Tennessee.The three corps of the Union army, as we have seen, were now separated
over a wide extent of territory by intervening ridges, so intent was
Rosecrans on intercepting the vanished Bragg.But the latter, by no means
vanished, and with his face toward Chattanooga, considered the position of
his antagonist and discovered his own army almost opposite the Federal
center.Crittenden was advancing toward Ringgold, and the remoteness of
Thomas' corps on his right precluded any immediate union of the Federal
forces.Bragg was quick to grasp the opportunity made by Rosecrans' division of
the army in the face of his opponent.He at once perceived the
possibilities of a master-stroke; to crush Thomas' advanced divisions with
an overwhelming force.The attempt failed, owing to a delay in the attack, which permitted the
endangered Baird and Negley to fall back.Bragg then resolved to throw
himself upon Crittenden, who had divided his corps.Polk was ordered to
advance upon that portion of it at Lee and Gordon's Mills, but when Bragg
came to the front September 13th, expecting to witness the annihilation
of the Twenty-first Corps, he found to his bitter disappointment that the
bishop-general had made no move and that Crittenden had reunited his
divisions and was safe on the west bank of the Chickamauga.Thus his
splendid chances of breaking up the Army of the Cumberland were ruined.When Bragg's position became known to Rosecrans, great was his haste to
effect the concentration of his army.Couriers dashed toward Alpine with
orders for McCook to join Thomas with the utmost celerity.The former
started at once, shortly after midnight on the 13th, in response to
Thomas's urgent call.It was a real race of life and death, attended by
the greatest hardships.Ignorant of the roads, McCook submitted his troops
to a most exhausting march, twice up and down the mountain, fifty-seven
miles of the most arduous toil, often dragging artillery up by hand and
letting it down steep declines by means of ropes.But he closed up with
Thomas on the 17th, and the Army of the Cumberland was saved from its
desperate peril.Crittenden's corps now took position at Lee and Gordon's Mills on the left
bank of Chickamauga Creek, and the Federal troops were all within
supporting distance.In the Indian tongue Chickamauga means "The River of
Death," a name strangely prophetic of that gigantic conflict soon to be
waged by these hostile forces throughout this beautiful and heretofore
peaceful valley.The Confederate army, its corps under Generals Polk, D. H. Hill, and
Buckner, was stationed on the east side of the stream, its right wing
below Lee and Gordon's Mills, and the left extending up the creek toward
Lafayette.On the Federal side Thomas was moved to the left, with
Crittenden in the center and McCook on the right.Their strength has been
estimated at fifty-five to sixty-nine thousand men.On the 18th,
Longstreet's troops were arriving from Virginia, and by the morning of the
19th the greater part of the Confederate army had crossed the
Chickamauga.The two mighty armies were now face to face, and none could
doubt that the impending struggle would be attended by frightful loss to
both sides.It was Bragg's intention to send Polk, commanding the right wing, in a
flanking movement against the Federal left under Thomas, and thus
intervene between it and Chattanooga.The first encounter, at 10 o'clock
in the morning of the 19th, resulted in a Confederate repulse, but fresh
divisions were constantly pushed forward under the deadly fire of the
Federal artillery.The Federals were gradually forced back by the
incessant charge of the Confederates; but assailed and assailant fought
with such great courage and determination that any decided advantage was
withheld from either.Meanwhile, the Federal right was hard pressed by
Hood, commanding Longstreet's corps, and a desperate battle ensued along
the entire line.It seemed, however, more like a struggle between separate
divisions than the clash of two great armies.When night descended the
Federals had been forced back from the creek, but the result had been
indecisive.Disaster to the Union army had been averted by the use of powerful
artillery when the infantry seemed unable to withstand the onslaught.Rosecrans had assumed the defensive, and his troops had so far receded as
to enable the Confederates to form their lines on all the territory fought
over on that day.During the night preparations were made in both camps
for a renewal of the battle on the following morning, which was Sunday.A
fresh disposition of the troops was made by both leaders.Near midnight
General Longstreet arrived on the field, and was once placed in command of
the Confederate left, Polk retaining the right.Not all of Longstreet's
troops arrived in time for the battle, but Bragg's force has been
estimated at fifty-one to seventy-one thousand strong.Thomas was given command of the Union left, with McCook at his right,
while Crittenden's forces occupied the center, but to the rear of both
Thomas and McCook.Thomas had spent the night in throwing up breastworks
on the brow of Snodgrass Hill, as it was anticipated that the Confederates
would concentrate their attack upon his position.Hostilities began with a general movement of the Confederate right wing in
an attempt to flank the Union left.General Bragg had ordered Polk to
begin the attack at daybreak, but it was nearly ten o'clock in the morning
before Breckinridge's division, supported by General Cleburne, advanced
upon Thomas' entrenchments.Fighting desperately, the Confederates did not
falter under the heavy fire of the Federals, and it seemed as if the
latter must be driven from their position.Rosecrans, in response to
urgent requests for reenforcements, despatched troops again and again to
the aid of Thomas, and the assault was finally repulsed.Cleburne's
division was driven back with heavy loss, and Breckinridge, unable to
retain any advantage, was forced to defend his right, which was being
seriously menaced.The battle at this point had been desperately waged,
both sides exhibiting marked courage and determination.As on the previous
day, the Confederates had been the aggressors, but the Federal troops had
resisted all attempts to invade their breastworks.However, the fortunes of battle were soon to incline to the side of the
Southern army.Bragg sent Stewart's division forward, and it pressed
Reynolds' and Brannan's men back to their entrenchments.Rosecrans sent
Wood word to close up on Reynolds.Through some misunderstanding in giving
or interpreting this order, General Wood withdrew his division from its
position on the right of Brannan.By this movement a large opening was
left almost in the center of the battle-line.Johnson's, Hindman's, and
Kershaw's divisions rushed into the gap and fell upon the Union right and
center with an impetus that was irresistible.The Confederate general,
Bushrod Johnson, has given us an unforgetable picture of the thrilling
event: "The resolute and impetuous charge, the rush of our heavy columns
sweeping out from the shadow and gloom of the forest into the open fields
flooded with sunlight, the glitter of arms, the onward dash of artillery
and mounted men, the retreat of the foe, the shouts of the hosts of our
army, the dust, the smoke, the noise of fire-arms--of whistling balls, and
grape-shot, and of bursting shell--made up a battle-scene of unsurpassed
grandeur.Here, General Hood gave me the last order I received from him on
the field, 'Go ahead and keep ahead of everything.'"A moment later, and
Hood fell, severely wounded, with a minie ball in his thigh.Wood's right brigade was shattered even before it had cleared the opening.Sheridan's entire division, and part of Davis' and Van Cleve's, were
driven from the field.Longstreet now gave a fine exhibition of his
military genius.The orders of battle were to separate the two wings of
the opposing army.But with the right wing of his opponents in hopeless
ruin, he wheeled to the right and compelled the further withdrawal of
Federal troops in order to escape being surrounded.The brave
soldier-poet, William H. Lytle, fell at the head of his brigade as he
strove to re-form his line.McCook and Crittenden were unable, in spite of
several gallant efforts, to rally their troops and keep back the onrushing
heroes of Stone's River and Bull Run.The broken mass fled in confusion
toward Chattanooga, carrying with it McCook, Crittenden, and Rosecrans.The latter telegraphed to Washington that his army had been beaten.In
this famous charge the Confederates took several thousand prisoners and
forty pieces of artillery.Flushed with victory, the Confederates now concentrated their attack upon
Thomas, who thus far, on Horseshoe Ridge and its spurs, had repelled all
attempts to dislodge him.The Confederates, with victory within their
grasp, and led by the indomitable Longstreet, swarmed up the <DW72>s in
great numbers, but they were hurled back with fearful slaughter.Thomas
was looking anxiously for Sheridan, whom, as he knew, Rosecrans had
ordered with two brigades to his support.But in Longstreet's rout of the
right wing Sheridan, with the rest, had been carried on toward
Chattanooga, and he found himself completely cut off from Thomas, as the
Confederates were moving parallel to him.Yet the indomitable Sheridan, in
spite of his terrible experience of the morning, did not give up the
attempt.Foiled in his efforts to get through McFarland's Gap, he moved
quickly on Rossville and came down the Lafayette road toward Thomas' left
flank.Meanwhile, advised by the incessant roar of musketry, General Gordon
Granger, in command of the reserve corps near Rossville, advanced rapidly
with his fresh troops.Acting with promptness and alacrity under orders,
Granger sent Steedman to Thomas' right.Directly across the line of Thomas' right was a ridge, on which Longstreet
stationed Hindman with a large command, ready for an attack on Thomas'
flank--a further and terrible menace to the nearly exhausted general, but
it was not all.In the ridge was a small gap, and through this Kershaw was
pouring his division, intent on getting to Thomas' rear.Rosecrans thus
describes the help afforded to Thomas: "Steedman, taking a regimental
color, led the column.Swift was the charge and terrible the conflict, but
the enemy was broken."The fighting grew fiercer, and at intervals was almost hand to hand.The
casualties among the officers, who frequently led their troops in person,
were mounting higher and higher as the moments passed.All the afternoon
the assaults continued, but the Union forces stood their ground.Ammunition ran dangerously low, but Steedman had brought a small supply,
and when this was distributed each man had about ten rounds.Finally, as
the sun was setting in the west, the Confederate troops advanced in a
mighty concourse.The combined forces of Kershaw, Law, Preston, and
Hindman once more rushed forward, gained possession of their lost ridge at
several points, but were unable to drive their attack home.In many places
the Union lines stood firm and both sides rested in the positions taken.The onslaught on the Federal left of the
battlefield was one of the heaviest attacks made on a single point during
the war.History records no grander spectacle than Thomas' stand at Chickamauga.He
was ever afterwards known as "The Rock of Chickamauga."Under the cover of
darkness, Thomas, having received word from Rosecrans to withdraw, retired
his army in good order to Rossville, and on the following day rejoined
Rosecrans in Chattanooga.The battle of Chickamauga, considering the
forces engaged, was one of the most destructive of the Civil War.The
Union army lost approximately sixteen thousand men, and while the loss to
the Confederate army is not definitely known, it was probably nearly
eighteen thousand.The personal daring and tenacious courage displayed in
the ranks of both armies have never been excelled on any battlefield.The
Confederate generals, Helm, Deshler, and Preston Smith were killed; Adams,
Hood, Brown, Gregg, Clayton, Hindman, and McNair were wounded.The battle is generally considered a Confederate victory,
and yet, aside from the terrible loss of human life, no distinct advantage
accrued to either side.The Federal army retained possession of
Chattanooga, but the Confederates had for the time checked the Army of the
Cumberland from a further occupation of Southern soil.It is a singular coincidence that the generals-in-chief of both armies
exercised but little supervision over the movements of their respective
troops.The brunt of the battle fell, for the most part, upon the
commanders of the wings.To the subordinate generals on each side were
awarded the highest honors.Longstreet, because of his eventful charge,
which swept the right wing of the Union army from the field, was
proclaimed the victor of Chickamauga; and to General Thomas, who by his
firmness and courage withstood the combined attack of the Confederate
forces when disaster threatened on every side, is due the brightest
laurels from the adherents of the North.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE LEADER AT CHICKAMAUGA

than that of any other Southern leader because of his brilliant record in
the Mexican War.In the Civil War he distinguished himself first at Shiloh
and by meritorious services thereafter.But his delays rendered him
scarcely a match for Rosecrans, to say nothing of Grant and Sherman.Flanked out of two strong positions, he missed the opportunity presented
by Rosecrans' widely separated forces and failed to crush the Army of the
Cumberland in detail, as it advanced to the battle of Chickamauga.The
error cost the Confederates the loss of Tennessee, eventually.[Illustration: THOMAS--THE "ROCK OF CHICKAMAUGA" WHO BECAME THE "SLEDGE OF

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Major-General George Henry Thomas, Virginia-born soldier loyal to the
Union; commended for gallantry in the Seminole War, and for service in
Mexico; won the battle of Mill Spring, January 19, 1862; commanded the
right wing of the Army of the Tennessee against Corinth and at Perryville,
and the center at Stone's River.Only his stability averted overwhelming
defeat for the Federals at Chickamauga.At Lookout Mountain and Missionary
Ridge he was a host in himself.After Sherman had taken Atlanta he sent
Thomas back to Tennessee to grapple with Hood.How he crushed Hood by his
sledge-hammer blows is told in the story of "Nashville."Thomas, sitting
down in Nashville, bearing the brunt of Grant's impatience, and ignoring
completely the proddings from Washington to advance before he was ready,
while he waited grimly for the psychological moment to strike the oncoming
Confederate host under Hood, is one of the really big dramatic figures of
the entire war.It has been well said of Thomas that every promotion he
received was a reward of merit; and that during his long and varied career
as a soldier no crisis ever arose too great for his ability.[Illustration: BEFORE CHICKAMAUGA--IN THE RUSH OF EVENTS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Rarely does the camera afford such a perfectly contemporaneous record of
the march of events so momentous.This photograph shows the hotel at
Stevenson, Alabama, during the Union advance that ended in Chickamauga.Sentinels are parading the street in front of the hotel, several horses
are tied to the hotel posts, and the officers evidently have gone into the
hotel headquarters.General Alexander McDowell McCook, commanding the old
Twentieth Army Corps, took possession of the hotel as temporary
headquarters on the movement of the Army of the Cumberland from Tullahoma.On August 29, 1863, between Stevenson and Caperton's Ferry, on the
Tennessee River, McCook gathered his boats and pontoons, hidden under the
dense foliage of overhanging trees, and when ready for his crossing
suddenly launched them into and across the river.Thence the troops
marched over Sand Mountain and at length into Lookout Valley.During the
movements the army was in extreme peril, for McCook was at one time three
days' march from Thomas, so that Bragg might have annihilated the
divisions in detail.Finally the scattered corps were concentrated along
Chickamauga Creek, where the bloody struggle of September 19th and 20th
was so bravely fought.[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO CHICKAMAUGA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This solitary observer, if he was standing here September 20, 1863,
shortly before this was photographed, certainly gazed at the base of the
hill to the left.For through the pass called Rossville Gap a column in
blue was streaming--Steedman's Division of the Reserve Corps, rushing to
aid Thomas, so sore pressed at Chickamauga.Those <DW72>s by Chickamauga
Creek witnessed the deadliest battle in the West and the highest in
percentage of killed and wounded of the entire war.It was fought as a
result of Rosecrans' attempt to maneuver Bragg out of Chattanooga.The
Federal army crossed the Tennessee River west of the city, passed through
the mountain-ranges, and came upon Bragg's line of communications.Finding
his position untenable, the Southern leader moved southward and fell upon
the united forces of Rosecrans along Chickamauga Creek.The vital point in
the Federal line was the left, held by Thomas.Should that give way, the
army would be cut off from Chattanooga, with no base to fall back on.The
heavy fighting of September 19th showed that Bragg realized the situation.For a time, the Union army was
driven back.But at nightfall Thomas had regained the lost ground.He
re-formed during the night in order to protect the road leading into
Chattanooga.Since the second day was foggy till the middle of the
forenoon, the fighting was not renewed till late.About noon a break was
made in the right of the Federal battle-line, into which the eager
Longstreet promptly hurled his men.Colonel Dodge writes: "Everything
seems lost.The entire right of the army, with Rosecrans and his staff, is
driven from the field in utter rout.But, unknown even to the commanding
general, Thomas, the Rock of Chickamauga, stands there at bay, surrounded,
facing two to one.Heedless of the wreck of one-half the army, he knows
not how to yield."[Illustration: THE TOO-ADVANCED POSITION

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Crawfish Spring, to the South of the Chickamauga Battle-field.Rosecrans,
in concentrating his troops on the 18th of September, was still possessed
of the idea that Bragg was covering his retreat upon his railroad
connections at Dalton.Instead, the Confederate commander had massed his
forces on the other side of Chickamauga and was only awaiting the arrival
of Longstreet to assume the aggressive.On the morning of the 19th,
McCook's right wing at Crawfish Spring was strongly threatened by the
Confederates, while the real attack was made against the left in an effort
to turn it and cut Rosecrans off from a retreat upon Chattanooga.All day
long, brigade after brigade was marched from the right of the Federal line
in order to extend the left under Thomas and withstand this flanking
movement.Even after nightfall, Thomas, trying to re-form his lines and
carry them still farther to the left for the work of the morrow, brought
on a sharp conflict in the darkness.The Confederates had been held back,
but at heavy cost.That night, at the Widow Glenn's house, Rosecrans
consulted his generals.The exhausted Thomas, when roused from sleep for
his opinion, invariably answered, "I would strengthen the left."There
seemed as yet to be no crisis at hand, and the council closed with a song
by the debonair McCook.[Illustration: WHERE THE LINES WERE SWEPT BACK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Lee & Gordon's mill, seen in the picture, marked the extreme right of the
Federal line on the second day at Chickamauga.From it, northward, were
posted the commands of McCook and Crittenden, depleted by the detachments
of troops the day before to strengthen the left.All might have gone well
if the main attack of the Confederates had continued to the left, as
Rosecrans expected.But hidden in the woods, almost within a stone's throw
of the Federal right on that misty morning, was the entire corps of
Longstreet, drawn up in columns of brigades at half distance--"a
masterpiece of tactics," giving space for each column to swing right or
left.Seizing a momentous opportunity which would have lasted but thirty
minutes at the most, Longstreet hurled them through a gap which, owing to
a misunderstanding, had been left open, and the entire Federal right was
swept from the field.[Illustration: THE HOUSE WHENCE HELP CAME

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Here, at his headquarters, holding the Federal line of retreat at
Rossville Gap (the Confederate objective in the battle), General Gordon
Granger heard with increasing anxiety the sounds of the conflict, three
miles away, growing more and more ominous.Finally, in disobedience of
orders, he set in motion his three brigades to the relief of Thomas,
pushing forward two of them under Steedman.These arrived upon the field
early in the afternoon, the most critical period of the battle, as
Longstreet charged afresh on Thomas' right and rear.Seizing a
battle-flag, Steedman (at the order of General Granger) led his command in
a counter-charge which saved the Army of the Cumberland.This old house at
Rossville was built by John Ross, a chief of the Cherokee Indians, and he
lived in it till 1832, giving his name to the hamlet.Half-breed
descendants of the Cherokees who had intermarried with both whites and
<DW64>s were numerous in the vicinity of Chickamauga, and many of them
fought with their white neighbors on the Confederate side.THE BATTLES ON LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN AND MISSIONARY RIDGE

    AFTER CHATTANOOGA: "The Confederate lines... could not be rebuilt.The blue-crested
    flood which had broken these lines was not disappearing.The fountains
    which supplied it were exhaustless.It was still coming with an ever
    increasing current, swelling higher and growing more resistless.This
    triune disaster [Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Missionary Ridge] was
    especially depressing to the people because it came like a blight upon
    their hopes which had been awakened by recent Confederate
    victories."--_General John B. Gordon, C. S. A., in "Reminiscences of
    the Civil War."_


Following the defeat of Rosecrans' army at Chickamauga in September 1863
Bragg at once took strong positions on Missionary Ridge and Lookout
Mountain.From these heights he was able to besiege the entire Army of the
Cumberland in Chattanooga and obstruct the main arteries of supply to the
Federal troops.Rosecrans was forced to abandon the route along the south
bank of the Tennessee River, which led from Bridgeport, in Alabama, and to
depend exclusively upon a long and mountainous wagon road on the north
side of the river for the transportation of supplies.The Confederate
cavalry, crossing the Tennessee above Chattanooga, fell upon the trains
entangled in the mud of the Sequatchie valley, destroying in one day three
hundred wagons, and killing or capturing about eighteen hundred mules.Within a short time the wisdom of Bragg's plan became apparent; famine
threatened the Union army and several thousand horses and mules had
already died from starvation.By his relentless vigil, the Confederate
leader seemed destined to achieve a greater victory over his opponent than
had hitherto attended his efforts in actual conflict.Meanwhile, a complete reorganization of the Federal forces in the West was
effected.Under the title of the Military Division of the Mississippi, the
Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the Tennessee were united
with Grant as general commanding, and Rosecrans was replaced by Thomas at
the head of the Army of the Cumberland.A hurried concentration of the Federal forces was now ordered by General
Halleck.Hooker with fifteen thousand men of the Army of the Potomac came
rapidly by rail to Bridgeport.Sherman, with a portion of his army, about
twenty thousand strong, was summoned from Vicksburg and at once embarked
in steamers for Memphis.General Grant decided to assume personal charge
of the Federal forces; but before he reached his new command, Thomas, ably
assisted by his chief engineer, General W. F. Smith, had begun to act on a
plan which Rosecrans had conceived, and which proved in the end to be a
brilliant conception.This was to seize a low range of hills known as
Raccoon Mountain on the peninsula made by a bend of the river, on its
south side and west of Chattanooga, and establish a wagon road to Kelly's
Ferry, a point farther down the river to which supplies could be brought
by boat from Bridgeport, and at the same time communication effected with
Hooker.A direct line was not only secured to Bridgeport, but Hooker advanced with
a portion of his troops into Lookout Valley and after a short but decisive
skirmish drove the Confederates across Lookout Creek, leaving his forces
in possession of the hills he had gained.The route was now opened between
Bridgeport and Brown's Ferry; abundant supplies were at once available and
the Army of the Cumberland relieved of its perilous position.Unlike the condition which had prevailed at Chickamauga, reenforcements
from all sides were hastening to the aid of Thomas' army; Hooker was
already on the ground; Sherman was advancing rapidly from Memphis, and he
arrived in person on November 15th, while Burnside's forces at Knoxville
offered protection to the left flank of the Federal army.The disposition of the Confederate troops at this time was a formidable
one; the left flank rested on the northern end of Lookout Mountain and the
line extended a distance of twelve miles across Chattanooga Valley to
Missionary Ridge.This position was further strengthened by entrenchments
throughout the lowlands.Despite the danger which threatened his army from
the converging Union forces, General Bragg determined to attack Burnside
and despatched Longstreet with twenty thousand of his best troops to
Knoxville.His army materially weakened, the Confederate general continued
to hold the same extended position, although his combined force was
smaller than had opposed Rosecrans alone at Chickamauga.On the 23d of November, after a long and fatiguing march over roads almost
impassable by reason of continuous rains, Sherman crossed the Tennessee by
the pontoon bridge at Brown's Ferry, recrossed it above Chattanooga, and
was assigned a position to the left of the main army near the mouth of
Chickamauga Creek.Grant had now some eighty thousand men, of whom sixty
thousand were on the scene of the coming battle, and, though fearful lest
Burnside should be dislodged from his position at Knoxville, he would not
be diverted from his purpose of sweeping the Confederates from the front
of Chattanooga.It had been Grant's plan to attack on the 24th, but
information reached him that Bragg was preparing a retreat.He, therefore,
on the 23d, ordered Thomas to advance upon Bragg's center.Preparations for movement were made in full view of the Confederates; from
the appearance of the troops, clad in their best uniforms, the advance
line of the Southern army was content to watch this display, in the belief
that the maneuvering army was parading in review.Suddenly, the peaceful
pageant turned into a furious charge, before which the Confederate
pickets, taken by surprise, retreated from the first line of earthworks,
and Thomas, with little loss to either side, captured Orchard Knob,
between Chattanooga and Missionary Ridge.From this point, which was
almost a mile in advance of the position occupied during the morning,
Grant directed the movements of his army on the following day.The Federal position was of less extent than that occupied by the
Confederates.Sherman was in command of the left wing, while Thomas held
the center, and "Fighting Joe" Hooker, with the Union right in Lookout
Valley, threatened Lookout Mountain.The plan of battle was for Sherman to
engage the Confederate right and sever communications between Bragg and
Longstreet; Hooker was to carry out an assault on the Southern left flank,
and at the same time maintain connection with Bridgeport.With both wings
assailed by a superior force, it was believed that Bragg must reenforce
these positions and permit Thomas, with overwhelming numbers, to
concentrate upon the center.On the 24th, two distinct movements were in progress.Sherman met with but
little opposition in his initial attack upon the Confederate right and
promptly seized and occupied the north end of Missionary Ridge.The
Confederates, late in the afternoon, fought desperately to regain the hill
but were finally repulsed, and Sherman fortified the position he had
gained.In the mean time, Hooker, early in the day, had begun his
operations against Lookout Mountain.Standing like a lone sentinel above
the surrounding valleys, its steep, rocky, and deeply furrowed <DW72>s,
rising into a high, palisaded crest, frowned defiance upon the advancing
troops, while a well-constructed line of defenses completed the imposing
barrier.Hooker had in addition to his own troops a division of Sherman's army
(Osterhaus') which, owing to damage to the pontoon bridge at Brown's
Ferry, had been prevented from joining its own leader.As ordered by
Hooker, General Geary took his division up the valley to Wauhatchie,
crossed the creek and marched down the east bank, sweeping the
Confederate outposts before him.The remainder of the command got across
by bridges lower down.Gaining the <DW72>s of the mountain the Federal
troops rushed on in their advance.From the high palisaded summit,
invisible in the low-hanging clouds, the guns of General Stevenson's
brigades poured an iron deluge upon them.But on they went, climbing over
ledges and boulders, up hill and down, while the soldiers of the South
with musket and cannon tried in vain to check them.Position after
position was abandoned to the onrushing Federals, and by noon Geary's
advanced troops had rounded the north <DW72> of the mountain and passed
from the sight of General Hooker, who was watching the contest from a
vantage point to the west.Grant and Thomas from the headquarters on
Orchard Knob were likewise eager witnesses of the struggle, although the
haze was so dense that they caught a glimpse only now and then as the
clouds would rise.Reenforcements came to the Confederates and they availed nothing.Geary's
troops had been ordered to halt when they reached the foot of the
palisades, but fired by success they pressed impetuously forward.From its
higher position at the base of the cliff Cobham's brigade showered volley
after volley upon the Confederate main line of defense, while that of
Ireland gradually rolled up the flank.The Federal batteries on Moccasin
Point across the river were doing what they could to clear the mountain.The Southerners made a last stand in their walls and pits around the
Craven house, but were finally driven in force over rocks and precipices
into Chattanooga Valley.Such was the "battle in the clouds," a wonderful spectacle denied the
remainder of Hooker's troops holding Lookout Valley.That general says,
"From the moment we had rounded the peak of the mountain it was only from
the roar of battle and the occasional glimpses our comrades in the valley
could catch of our lines and standards that they knew of the strife or
its progress, and when from these evidences our true condition was
revealed to them their painful anxiety yielded to transports of joy which
only soldiers can feel in the earliest moments of dawning victory."By two in the afternoon the clouds had settled completely into the valley
and the ensuing darkness put an end to further operations.Hooker
established and strengthened a new position and waited for reenforcements,
which General Carlin brought from Chattanooga at five o'clock.Until after
midnight an irregular fire was kept up, but the Confederates could not
break the new line.Before dawn General Stevenson abandoned the summit,
leaving behind twenty thousand rations and the camp equipage of his three
brigades.Hooker, anticipating this move, sent several detachments to
scale the palisades.A party of six men from the Eighth Kentucky regiment,
by means of ladders, was the first to reach the summit, and the waving
Stars and Stripes greeted the rising sun of November 25th on Lookout
Mountain, amid the wild and prolonged cheers of "Fighting Joe's" valiant
troops.The fighting of Sherman and Hooker on the 24th secured to Grant's army a
distinct advantage in position.From the north end of Lookout Mountain
across Chattanooga Valley to the north end of Missionary Ridge the Union
forces maintained an unbroken front.The morning of the 25th dawned cold, and an impenetrable mist which lay
deep in the valleys was soon driven away.From Orchard Knob, a point
almost in the center of the united Federal host, General Grant watched the
preparations for the battle.At sunrise, Sherman's command was in motion.In his front, an open space intervened between his position and a ridge
held by the Confederates, while just beyond rose a much higher hill.Toward the first ridge the attacking column, under General Corse, advanced
rapidly and in full view of the foe.For a time it seemed as if the
Confederates must recede before the terrific onslaught, but the advance
was abruptly checked after a very close and stubborn struggle, when
within a short distance of the entrenchment.Unmindful of the numbers which opposed him, General Hardee not only
succeeded in repulsing the attack, but, assuming the offensive, drove back
the forces under General John E. Smith, who had sought to turn his left,
and captured several hundred prisoners.The Federals, quickly re-forming
their lines, renewed the assault and for several hours the fighting was
desperate on both sides.A general advance of the Northern forces had been
withheld, awaiting the arrival of Hooker who, under orders from Grant, was
sweeping down Chickamauga Valley, and was to operate against the
Confederate left and rear, in the expectation that Bragg would further
weaken his line by massing at those points.But Hooker's army had been
delayed several hours by repairs to the bridge crossing Chattanooga Creek.Although Sherman had failed in his attempt to turn the Confederate right
he had forced Bragg to draw heavily upon his center for reenforcements.Grant, satisfied that Hooker was not far off, ordered the signal--six guns
fired in rapid succession from the battery on Orchard Knob--for a general
advance of Thomas' army upon the Confederate center.It was now three o'clock in the afternoon.The four division commanders of
the Army of the Cumberland, Sheridan, Wood, Baird, and Johnson, gave the
word to advance.Between Orchard Knob and the base of Missionary Ridge, a
mile away, is a broad valley covered for the most part with heavy timber.This had to be crossed before the entrenchments at the foot of the hill
could be assaulted.Scarcely were the Cumberland troops in motion when
fifty pieces of artillery on the crest of Missionary Ridge opened a
terrific fire upon them.But the onward rush of the Federals was not
checked in the slightest degree.The line of entrenchments at the base was
carried with little opposition.Most of Breckinridge's men abandoned the
ditches as the Federal skirmishers approached and sought refuge up the
hill, breaking and throwing into confusion other troops as they passed
through.At the foot of Missionary Ridge Thomas' army had reached its goal.But, as General Wood has related, "the
enthusiasm and impetuosity of the troops were such that those who first
reached the entrenchments at the base of the ridge bounded over them and
pressed on up the ascent.... Moreover the entrenchments were no protection
against the artillery on the ridge.To remain would be destruction--to
return would be both expensive in life, and disgraceful.Officers and men,
all seemed impressed with this truth.... Without waiting for an order the
vast mass pressed forward in the race for glory, each man anxious to be
the first on the summit.... Artillery and musketry could not check the
impetuous assault.To have done so would
have been ruinous.Little was left to the commanders of the troops than to
cheer on the foremost--to encourage the weaker of limb and to sustain the
very few who seemed to be faint-hearted."Midway up the <DW72> was a small line of rifle-pits, but these proved of no
use in stemming the Federal tide.In the immediate front, however, Major
Weaver of the Sixtieth North Carolina rallied a sufficient number of the
demoralized Confederates to send a well-directed and effective fire upon
the advancing troops.At this point the first line of oncoming Federals
was vigorously repulsed, and thrown back to the vacated Confederate
trenches.General Bragg, noticing this, rode along the ridge to spread his
good news among the troops, but he had not gone far when word was brought
that the right flank was broken and that the Federal standard had been
seen on the summit.A second and a third flag appeared in quick
succession.Bragg sent General Bate to drive the foe back, but the
disaster was so great that the latter was unable to repair it.Even the
artillery had abandoned the infantry.The Confederate flank had gone, and
within an hour of the start from Orchard Knob the crest of Missionary
Ridge was occupied by Federal troops.He went
down the eastern <DW72>, driving all in front of him toward Chickamauga
Creek.On a more easterly ridge he rested until midnight, when he advanced
to the creek and took many prisoners and stores.While the Army of the Cumberland accomplished these things, Hooker was
advancing his divisions at charging pace from the south.Cruft was on the
crest, Osterhaus in the eastern valley, and Geary in the western--all
within easy supporting distance.Before Cruft's onrush the left wing of
Bragg's army was scattered in all directions from the ridge.Many ran down
the eastern <DW72> into Osterhaus' column and the very few who chose a way
of flight to the west, were captured by Geary.The bulk of them, however,
fell back from trench to trench upon the crest until finally, as the sun
was sinking, they found themselves surrounded by Johnson's division of the
Army of the Cumberland.Such was the fate of Stewart's division; only a
small portion of it got away.On the Confederate right Hardee held his own against Sherman, but with the
left and center routed and in rapid flight Bragg realized the day was
lost.He could do nothing but cover Breckinridge's retreat as best he
might and order Hardee to retire across Chickamauga Creek.Bragg's army had been wholly
defeated, and, after being pursued for some days, it found a resting place
at Dalton among the mountains of Georgia.The Federal victory was the
result of a campaign carefully planned by Generals Halleck and Grant and
ably carried out by the efforts of the subordinate generals.The losses in killed and wounded sustained by Grant were over fifty-eight
hundred and those of Bragg about sixty-six hundred, four thousand being
prisoners.But the advantage of the great position had been forever
wrested from the Southern army.[Illustration: THE BESIEGED

ground overlooking the stream, was posted Battery McAloon to keep the
Confederates back from the river, so that timber and firewood could be
rafted down to the besieged army.In the chill of autumn, with scanty
rations, the soldiers had a hard time keeping warm, as all fuel within the
lines had been consumed.The Army of the Cumberland was almost conquered
by hardship.Grant feared that the soldiers "could not be got out of their
trenches to assume the offensive."But it was these very men who achieved
the most signal victory in the battle of Chattanooga.[Illustration: OPENING "THE CRACKER LINE"

on the upper Tennessee River.Had the gunboats on the Ohio been able to
come up the Tennessee River nearly three hundred miles, to the assistance
of Rosecrans, Bragg could never have bottled him up in Chattanooga.But
between Florence and Decatur, Alabama, Muscle Shoals lay in the stream,
making the river impassable.While Bragg's pickets invested the railroad
and river, supplies could not be brought up from Bridgeport; and besides,
with the exception of one small steamboat (the _Dunbar_), the Federals had
no boats on the river.General W. F. Smith, Chief Engineer of the Army of
the Cumberland, had established a saw-mill with an old engine at
Bridgeport for the purpose of getting out lumber from logs rafted down the
river, with which to construct pontoons.Here Captain Arthur Edwards,
Assistant Quartermaster, had been endeavoring since the siege began to
build a steamboat consisting of a flat-bottom scow, with engine, boiler,
and stern-wheel mounted upon it.On October 24th, after many difficulties
and discouragements had been overcome, the vessel was launched
successfully and christened the _Chattanooga_.On the 29th she made her
trial trip.That very night, Hooker, in the battle of Wauhatchie,
definitely established control of the new twelve-mile "Cracker Line" from
Kelley's Ferry, which Grant had ordered for the relief of the starving
army.The next day the little _Chattanooga_, with steam up, was ready to
start from Bridgeport with a heavy load of the much-needed supplies, and
her arrival was anxiously awaited at Kelley's Ferry, where the
wagon-trains were all ready to rush forward the rations and forage to
Chattanooga.The mechanics were still at work upon the little vessel's
unfinished pilot-house and boiler-deck while she and the two barges she
was to tow were being loaded, and at 4 A.M.on November 30th she set out
to make the 45-mile journey against unfavorable head-winds.[Illustration: THE WELCOME NEWCOMER

day, and then was enveloped in one of the darkest of nights, out of which
a blinding rain stung the faces of her anxious crew.Assistant
Quartermaster William G. Le Duc, in command of the expedition, helped the
pilot to feel his way through the darkness.At last the camp-fires of the
Federals became guiding beacons from the shore and soon the _Chattanooga_
tied up safely at Kelley's Ferry.The "Cracker Line" was at last opened in
the nick of time, for there were but four boxes of hard bread left in the
commissary at Chattanooga, where four cakes of hard bread and one-quarter
of a pound of pork were being issued as a three-days' ration.[Illustration: WHERE AN ARMY GAVE ITS OWN ORDERS

Confederates and captured Orchard Knob (or Indian Hill) a day before it
had been planned to do so.Still another surprise awaited Grant on the
25th, when from this eminence he watched the magnificent spectacle of the
battle of Chattanooga.Thomas' men again pressed forward in what was
ordered as a demonstration against Missionary Ridge.Up and over it they

they drove back the Confederates and established the new line of

another.The heavy musketry fire and the boom of the Confederate battery
on the top of the mountain apprised the waiting Federals before
Chattanooga that the battle had begun.Now and again the fitful lifting of
the mist disclosed to Grant and Thomas, watching from Orchard Knob, the
men of Hooker fighting upon the heights.Then all would be curtained once
more.At two o'clock in the afternoon the mist became so heavy that Hooker
and his men could not see what they were doing, and paused to entrench.By
four o'clock, however, he had pushed on to the summit and reported to
Grant that his position was impregnable.Direct communication was then
established and reenforcements sent.[Illustration: THE PEAK OF VICTORY--THE MORNING AFTER THE BATTLE

THE BATTLE IN THE WILDERNESS

    The volunteers who composed the armies of the Potomac and Northern
    Virginia were real soldiers now, inured to war, and desperate in their
    determination to do its work without faltering or failure.This
    fact--this change in the temper and _morale_ of the men on either
    side--had greatly simplified the tasks set for Grant and Lee to solve.They knew that those men would stand against
    anything, endure slaughter without flinching, hardship without
    complaining, and make desperate endeavor without shrinking.The two
    armies had become what they had not been earlier in the contest,
    _perfect instruments of war_, that could be relied upon as confidently
    as the machinist relies upon his engine scheduled to make so many
    revolutions per minute at a given rate of horse-power, and with the
    precision of science itself.--_George Cary Eggleston, in "The History
    of the Confederate War."_


After the battle of Gettysburg, Lee started for the Potomac, which he
crossed with some difficulty, but with little interruption from the
Federals, above Harper's Ferry, on July 14, 1863.The thwarted invader of
Pennsylvania wished to get to the plains of Virginia as quickly as
possible, but the Shenandoah was found to be impassable.Meade, in the
mean time, had crossed the Potomac east of the Blue Ridge and seized the
principal outlets from the lower part of the Valley.Lee, therefore, was
compelled to continue his retreat up the Shenandoah until Longstreet, sent
in advance with part of his command, had so blocked the Federal pursuit
that most of the Confederate army was able to emerge through Chester Gap
and move to Culpeper Court House.Ewell marched through Thornton's Gap and
by the 4th of August practically the whole Army of Northern Virginia was
south of the Rapidan, prepared to dispute the crossing of that river.But
Meade, continuing his flank pursuit, halted at Culpeper Court House,
deeming it imprudent to attempt the Rapidan in the face of the strongly
entrenched Confederates.In the entire movement there had been no fighting
except a few cavalry skirmishes and no serious loss on either side.On the 9th of September, Lee sent Longstreet and his corps to assist Bragg
in the great conflict that was seen to be inevitable around Chattanooga.In spite of reduced strength, Lee proceeded to assume a threatening
attitude toward Meade, and in October and early November there were
several small but severe engagements as the Confederate leader attempted
to turn Meade's flank and force him back to the old line of Bull Run.On
the 7th of November, Sedgwick made a brilliant capture of the redoubts on
the Rappahannock, and Lee returned once more to his old position on the
south side of the Rapidan.This lay between Barnett's Ford, near Orange
Court House (Lee's headquarters), and Morton's Ford, twenty miles below.Its right was also protected by entrenchments along the course of Mine
Run.Against these, in the last days of November, Meade sent French,
Sedgwick, and Warren.It was found impossible to carry the Confederate
position, and on December 1st the Federal troops were ordered to recross
the Rapidan.In this short campaign the Union lost sixteen hundred men and
the Confederacy half that number.With the exception of an unsuccessful
cavalry raid against Richmond, in February, nothing disturbed the
existence of the two armies until the coming of Grant.In the early months of 1864, the Army of the Potomac lay between the
Rapidan and the Rappahannock, most of it in the vicinity of Culpeper Court
House, although some of the troops were guarding the railroad to
Washington as far as Bristoe Station, close to Manassas Junction.On the
south side of the Rapidan, the Army of Northern Virginia was, as has been
seen, securely entrenched.The Confederates' ranks were thin and their
supplies were scarce; but the valiant spirit which had characterized the
Southern hosts in former battles still burned fiercely within their
breasts, presaging many desperate battles before the heel of the invader
should tread upon their cherished capital, Richmond, and their loved
cause, the Confederacy.Within the camp religious services had been held for weeks in succession,
resulting in the conversion of large numbers of the soldiers.The influence of the awakening among the men in the
army during this revival was manifest after the war was over, when the
soldiers had gone back to civil life, under conditions most trying and
severe.To this spiritual frame of mind may be credited, perhaps, some of
the remarkable feats accomplished in subsequent battles by the Confederate
army.On February 29, 1864, the United States Congress passed law reviving the
grade of lieutenant-general, the title being intended for Grant, who was
made general-in-chief of the armies of the United States.Grant had come
from his victorious battle-grounds in the West, and all eyes turned to him
as the chieftain who should lead the Union army to success.On the 9th of
March he received his commission.He now planned the final great double
movement of the war.Taking control of the whole campaign against Lee, but
leaving the Army of the Potomac under Meade's direct command, he chose the
strongest of his corps commanders, W. T. Sherman, for the head of affairs
in the West.Grant's immediate objects were to defeat Lee's army and to
capture Richmond, the latter to be accomplished by General Butler and the
Army of the James; Sherman's object was to crush Johnston, to seize that
important railroad center, Atlanta, Georgia, and, with Banks' assistance,
to open a way between the Atlantic coast and Mobile, on the Gulf, thus
dividing the Confederacy north and south, as the conquest of the
Mississippi had parted it east and west.It was believed that if either or
both of these campaigns were successful, the downfall of the Confederacy
would be assured.On a recommendation of General Meade's, the Army of the Potomac was
reorganized into three corps instead of the previous five.The Second,
Fifth, and Sixth corps were retained, absorbing the First and Third.Hancock was in command of the Second; Warren, the Fifth; and Sedgwick, the
Sixth.Sheridan was at the head of the cavalry.The Ninth Corps acted as a
separate army under Burnside, and was now protecting the Orange and
Alexandria Railroad.As soon as Meade had crossed the Rapidan, Burnside
was ordered to move promptly, and he reached the battlefield of the
Wilderness on the morning of May 6th.On May 24th his corps was assigned
to the Army of the Potomac.The Union forces, including the Ninth Corps,
numbered about one hundred and eighteen thousand men.The Army of Northern Virginia consisted of three corps of infantry, the
First under Longstreet, the Second under Ewell, and the Third under A. P.
Hill, and a cavalry corps commanded by Stuart.A notable fact in the
organization of the Confederate army was the few changes made in
commanders.The total forces under Lee were about sixty-two thousand.After assuming command, Grant established his headquarters at Culpeper
Court House, whence he visited Washington once a week to consult with
President Lincoln and the Secretary of War.He was given full authority,
however, as to men and movements, and worked out a plan of campaign which
resulted in a series of battles in Virginia unparalleled in history.The
first of these was precipitated in a dense forest, a wilderness, from
which the battle takes its name.Grant decided on a general advance of the Army of the Potomac upon Lee,
and early on the morning of May 4th the movement began by crossing the
Rapidan at several fords below Lee's entrenched position, and moving by
his right flank.The crossing was effected successfully, the line of march
taking part of the Federal troops over a scene of defeat in the previous
spring.One year before, the magnificent Army of the Potomac, just from a
long winter's rest in the encampment at Falmouth on the north bank of the
Rappahannock, had met the legions of the South in deadly combat on the
battlefield of Chancellorsville.And now Grant was leading the same army,
whose ranks had been freshened by new recruits from the North, through the
same field of war.By eight o'clock on the morning of the 4th the various rumors as to the
Federal army's crossing the Rapidan received by Lee were fully confirmed,
and at once he prepared to set his own army in motion for the Wilderness,
and to throw himself across the path of his foe.Two days before he had
gathered his corps and division commanders around him at the signal
station on Clark's Mountain, a considerable eminence south of the Rapidan,
near Robertson's Ford.Here he expressed the opinion that Grant would
cross at the lower fords, as he did, but nevertheless Longstreet was kept
at Gordonsville in case the Federals should move by the Confederate left.The day was oppressively hot, and the troops suffered greatly from thirst
as they plodded along the forest aisles through the jungle-like region.The Wilderness was a maze of trees, underbrush, and ragged foliage.Low-limbed pines, scrub-oaks, hazels, and chinkapins interlaced their
branches on the sides of rough country roads that lead through this
labyrinth of desolation.The weary troops looked upon the heavy tangles of
fallen timber and dense undergrowth with a sense of isolation.Only the
sounds of the birds in the trees, the rustling of the leaves, and the
passing of the army relieved the heavy pall of solitude that bore upon the
senses of the Federal host.The forces of the Northern army advanced into the vast no-man's land by
the roads leading from the fords.In the afternoon, Hancock was resting at
Chancellorsville, while Warren posted his corps near the Wilderness
Tavern, in which General Grant established his headquarters.Sedgwick's
corps had followed in the track of Warren's veterans, but was ordered to
halt near the river crossing, or a little south of it.The cavalry, as
much as was not covering the rear wagon trains, was stationed near
Chancellorsville and the Wilderness Tavern.That night the men from the
North lay in bivouac with little fear of being attacked in this wilderness
of waste, where military maneuvers would be very difficult.Two roads--the old Orange turnpike and the Orange plank road--enter the
Wilderness from the southwest.Along these the Confederates moved from
their entrenched position to oppose the advancing hosts of the North.Ewell took the old turnpike and Hill the plank road.Longstreet was
hastening from Gordonsville.The troops of Longstreet, on the one side,
and of Burnside, on the other, arrived on the field after exhausting
forced marches.The locality in which the Federal army found itself on the 5th of May was
not one that any commander would choose for a battle-ground.Lee was more
familiar with its terrible features than was his opponent, but this gave
him little or no advantage.Grant, having decided to move by the
Confederate right flank, could only hope to pass through the desolate
region and reach more open country before the inevitable clash would come.General Humphreys, who was Meade's chief of staff,
says in his "Virginia Campaign of 1864 and 1865": "So far as I know, no
great battle ever took place before on such ground.But little of the
combatants could be seen, and its progress was known to the senses chiefly
by the rising and falling sounds of a vast musketry fire that continually
swept along the lines of battle, many miles in length, sounds which at
times approached to the sublime."As Ewell, moving along the old turnpike on the morning of May 5th, came
near the Germanna Ford road, Warren's corps was marching down the latter
on its way to Parker's store, the destination assigned it by the orders of
the day.This meeting precipitated the battle of the Wilderness.Meade learned the position of Ewell's advance division and ordered an
attack.The Confederates were driven back a mile or two, but, re-forming
and reenforced, the tide of battle was turned the other way.Sedgwick's
marching orders were sending him to the Wilderness Tavern on the turnpike.He was on his way when the battle began, and he now turned to the right
from the Germanna Ford road and formed several of his divisions on
Warren's right.The presence of Hill on the plank road became known to
Meade and Grant, about eight in the morning.Hancock, at Chancellorsville,
was too far away to check him, so Getty's division of Sedgwick's corps, on
its way to the right, was sent over the Brock road to its junction with
the plank road for the purpose of driving Hill back, if possible, beyond
Parker's store.Warren and Sedgwick began to entrench themselves when they realized that
Ewell had effectively blocked their progress.Getty, at the junction of
the Brock and the Orange plank roads, was likewise throwing up breastworks
as fast as he could.Hancock, coming down the Brock road from
Chancellorsville, reached him at two in the afternoon and found two of A.
P. Hill's divisions in front.After waiting to finish his breastworks,
Getty, a little after four o'clock, started, with Hancock supporting him,
to carry out his orders to drive Hill back.Hancock says: "The fighting
became very fierce at once.The lines of battle were exceedingly close,
the musketry continuous and deadly along the entire line.... The battle
raged with great severity and obstinacy until about 8 P.M.Here, on the Federal left, and in this
desperate engagement, General Alexander Hays, one of Hancock's brigade
commanders, was shot through the head and killed.The afternoon had worn away with heavy skirmishing on the right.About
five o'clock Meade made another attempt on Ewell's forces.Both lines were
well entrenched, but the Confederate artillery enfiladed the Federal
positions.It was after dark when General Seymour of Sedgwick's corps
finally withdrew his brigade, with heavy loss in killed and wounded.When the battle roar had ceased, the rank and file of the Confederate
soldiers learned with sorrow of the death of one of the most dashing
brigade leaders in Ewell's corps, General John M. Jones.This fighting was
the preliminary struggle for position in the formation of the battle-lines
of the two armies, to secure the final hold for the death grapple.The
contestants were without advantage on either side when the sanguinary
day's work was finished.Both armies had constructed breastworks and were entrenched very close to
each other, front to front, gathered and poised for a deadly spring.Early
on the morning of May 6th Hancock was reenforced by Burnside, and Hill by
Longstreet.Grant issued orders, through Meade, for a general attack by Sedgwick,
Warren, and Hancock along the entire line, at five o'clock on the morning
of the 6th.Fifteen minutes before five the Confederates opened fire on
Sedgwick's right, and soon the battle was raging along the whole five-mile
front.It became a hand-to-hand contest.The Federals advanced with great
difficulty.The combatants came upon each other but a few paces apart.Soldiers on one side became hopelessly mixed with those of the other.Artillery played but little part in the battle of the Wilderness.The
cavalry of the two armies had one indecisive engagement on the 5th.The
next day both Custer and Gregg repulsed Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee in two
separate encounters, but Sheridan was unable to follow up the advantage.He had been entrusted with the care of the wagon trains and dared not take
his cavalry too far from them.The battle was chiefly one of musketry.Volley upon volley was poured out unceasingly; screaming bullets mingled
with terrific yells in the dense woods.The noise became deafening, and
the wounded and dying lying on the ground among the trees made a scene of
indescribable horror.Living men rushed in to take the places of those
who had fallen.The missiles cut branches from the trees, and saplings
were mowed down as grass in a meadow is cut by a scythe.Bloody remnants
of uniforms, blue and gray, hung as weird and uncanny decorations from
remaining branches.The story of the Federal right during the morning is easily told.Persistently and often as he tried, Warren could make no impression on the
strongly entrenched Ewell--nor could Sedgwick, who was trying equally hard
with Wright's division of his corps.But with Hancock on the left, in his
entrenchments on the Brock road, it was different.The gallant and heroic
charges here have elicited praise and admiration from friend and foe
alike.At first, Hill was forced back in disorder, and driven in confusion
a mile and a half from his line.The Confederates seemed on the verge of
panic and rout.From the rear of the troops in gray came the beloved
leader of the Southern host, General Lee.He was astride his favorite
battle-horse, and his face was set in lines of determination.Though the
crisis of the battle for the Confederates had arrived, Lee's voice was
calm and soft as he commanded, "Follow me," and then urged his charger
toward the bristling front of the Federal lines.The Confederate ranks
were electrified by the brave example of their commander.A ragged veteran
who had followed Lee through many campaigns, leaped forward and caught the
bridle-rein of the horse."We won't go on until you go back," cried the
devoted warrior.Instantly the Confederate ranks resounded with the cry,
"Lee to the rear!and the great general went back to
safety while his soldiers again took up the gage of battle and plunged
into the smoke and death-laden storm.But Lee, by his personal presence,
and the arrival of Longstreet, had restored order and courage in the
ranks, and their original position was soon regained.The pursuit of the Confederates through the dense forest had caused
confusion and disorganization in Hancock's corps.That cohesion and
strength in a battle-line of soldiers, where the men can "feel the touch,"
shoulder to shoulder, was wanting, and the usual form and regular
alignment was broken.It was two hours before the lines were re-formed.That short time had been well utilized by the Confederates.Gregg's eight
hundred Texans made a desperate charge through the thicket of the pine
against Webb's brigade of Hancock's corps, cutting through the growth, and
wildly shouting amid the crash and roar of the battle.Half of their
number were left on the field, but the blow had effectually checked the
Federal advance.While the battle was raging Grant's general demeanor was imperturbable.He
remained with Meade nearly the whole day at headquarters at the Lacy
house.He sat upon a stump most of the time, or at the foot of a tree,
leaning against its trunk, whittling sticks with his pocket-knife and
smoking big black cigars--twenty during the day.He received reports of
the progress of the battle and gave orders without the least evidence of
excitement or emotion."His orders," said one of his staff, "were given
with a spur," implying instant action.On one occasion, when an officer,
in great excitement, brought him the report of Hancock's misfortune and
expressed apprehension as to Lee's purpose, Grant exclaimed with some
warmth: "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing what Lee is going to do.Go
back to your command and try to think what we are going to do ourselves."Several brigades of Longstreet's troops, though weary from their forced
march, were sent on a flanking movement against Hancock's left, which
demoralized Mott's division and caused it to fall back three-quarters of a
mile.Longstreet now advanced with the rest of his corps.The dashing
leader, while riding with Generals Kershaw and Jenkins at the head of
Jenkins' brigade on the right of the Southern battle array, was screened
by the tangled thickets from the view of his own troops, flushed with the
success of brilliant flank movement.Suddenly the passing column was seen
indistinctly through an opening and a volley burst forth and struck the
officers.When the smoke lifted Longstreet and Jenkins were down--the
former seriously wounded, and the latter killed outright.As at
Chancellorsville a year before and on the same battle-ground, a great
captain of the Confederacy was shot down by his own men, and by accident,
at the crisis of a battle.Jackson lingered several days after
Chancellorsville, while Longstreet recovered and lived to fight for the
Confederacy till the surrender at Appomattox.General Wadsworth, of
Hancock's corps, was mortally wounded during the day, while making a
daring assault on the Confederate works, at the head of his men.During the afternoon, the Confederate attack upon Hancock's and Burnside's
forces, which constituted nearly half the entire army, was so severe that
the Federal lines began to give way.The combatants swayed back and forth;
the Confederates seized the Federal breastworks repeatedly, only to be
repulsed again and again.Once, the Southern colors were placed on the
Union battlements.A fire in the forest, which had been burning for hours,
and in which, it is estimated, about two hundred of the Federal wounded
perished, was communicated to the timber entrenchments, the heat and smoke
driving into the faces of the men on the Union side, and compelling them
in some places to abandon the works.Hancock made a gallant and heroic
effort to re-form his lines and push the attack, and, as he rode along the
lines, his inspiring presence elicited cheer upon cheer from the men, but
the troops had exhausted their ammunition, the wagons were in the rear,
and as night was approaching, further attack was abandoned.The contest
ended on the lines where it began.Later in the evening consternation swept the Federal camp when heavy
firing was heard in the direction of Sedgwick's corps, on the right.The
report was current that the entire Sixth Corps had been attacked and
broken.What had happened was a surprise attack by the Confederates,
commanded by General John B. Gordon, on Sedgwick's right flank, Generals
Seymour and Shaler with six hundred men being captured.When a message was
received from Sedgwick that the Sixth Corps was safe in an entirely new
line, there was great rejoicing in the Union camp.Thus ended the two days' fighting of the battle of the Wilderness, one of
the greatest struggles in history.It was Grant's first experience in the
East, and his trial measure of arms with his great antagonist, General
Lee.The latter returned to his entrenchments and the Federals remained in
their position.While Grant had been
defeated in his plan to pass around Lee, yet he had made a new record for
the Army of the Potomac, and he was not turned from his purpose of putting
himself between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.During the two days' engagement, there were ten hours of
actual fighting, with a loss in killed and wounded of about seventeen
thousand Union and nearly twelve thousand Confederates, nearly three
thousand men sacrificed each hour.It is the belief of some military
writers that Lee deliberately chose the Wilderness as a battle-ground, as
it would effectually conceal great inferiority of force, but if this be so
he seems to have come to share the unanimous opinions of the generals of
both sides that its difficulties were unsurmountable, and within his
entrenchments he awaited further attack.The next night, May 7th, Grant's march by the Confederate right flank was
resumed, but only to be blocked again by the dogged determination of the
tenacious antagonist, a few miles beyond, at Spotsylvania.It is not strange that the minds of these two
men moved along the same lines in military strategy, when we remember they
were both military experts of the highest order, and were now working out
the same problem.The results obtained by each are told in the story of
the battle of Spotsylvania.[Illustration: LEE'S MEN]

The faces of the veterans in this photograph of 1864 reflect more forcibly
than volumes of historical essays, the privations and the courage of the
ragged veterans in gray who faced Grant, with Lee as their leader.They
did not know that their struggle had already become unavailing; that no
amount of perseverance and devotion could make headway against the
resources, determination, and discipline of the Northern armies, now that
they had become concentrated and wielded by a master of men like Grant.But Grant was as yet little more than a name to the armies of the East.His successes had been won on Western fields--Donelson, Vicksburg,
Chattanooga.It was not yet known that the Army of the Potomac under the
new general-in-chief was to prove irresistible.[Illustration: CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS IN VIRGINIA, 1864

captures during May and June, when he sent some ten thousand Confederates
to Coxey's Landing, Virginia, as a result of his first stroke against
Lee--though their arms have been taken from them, though their uniforms
are anything but "uniform," their hats partly the regulation felt of the
Army of Northern Virginia, partly captured Federal caps, and partly
nondescript--yet these ragged veterans stand and sit with the dignity of
accomplishment.To them, "Marse Robert" is still the general
unconquerable, under whom inferior numbers again and again have held their
own, and more; the brilliant leader under whom every man gladly rushes to
any assault, however impossible it seems, knowing that every order will be
made to count.[Illustration: THE COMING OF THE STRANGER GRANT

1864.The day before, in Washington, President Lincoln handed him his
commission, appointing him Lieutenant-General in command of all the
Federal forces.His visit to Washington convinced him of the wisdom of
remaining in the East to direct affairs, and his first interview with
Meade decided him to retain that efficient general in command of the Army
of the Potomac.The two men had known each other but slightly from casual
meetings during the Mexican War."I was a stranger to most of the Army of
the Potomac," said Grant, "but Meade's modesty and willingness to serve in
any capacity impressed me even more than had his victory at Gettysburg."The only prominent officers Grant brought on from the West were Sheridan
and Rawlins.[Illustration: SIGNALING ORDERS FROM GENERAL MEADE'S HEADQUARTERS, JUST
BEFORE THE WILDERNESS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In April, 1864, General Meade's headquarters lay north of the Rapidan.The
Signal Corps was kept busy transmitting the orders preliminary to the
Wilderness campaign, which was to begin May 5th.The headquarters are
below the brow of the hill.A most important part of the Signal Corps'
duty was the interception and translation of messages interchanged between
the Confederate signal-men.A veteran of Sheridan's army tells of his
impressions as follows: "On the evening of the 18th of October, 1864, the
soldiers of Sheridan's army lay in their lines at Cedar Creek.Our
attention was suddenly directed to the ridge of Massanutten, or Three Top
Mountain, the <DW72> of which covered the left wing of the army--the Eighth
Corps.A lively series of signals was being flashed out from the peak, and
it was evident that messages were being sent both eastward and westward of
the ridge.I can recall now the feeling with which we looked up at those
flashes going over our heads, knowing that they must be Confederate
messages.It was only later that we learned that a keen-eyed Union officer
had been able to read the message: 'To Lieutenant-General Early.Be ready
to move as soon as my forces join you, and we will crush Sheridan.The sturdiness of Sheridan's veterans and
the fresh spirit put into the hearts of the men by the return of Sheridan
himself from 'Winchester, twenty miles away,' a ride rendered immortal by
Read's poem, proved too much at last for the pluck and persistency of
Early's worn-out troops."[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO THE FRONT

the Army of the Potomac awoke to the activity of the spring campaign.One
of the first essentials was to get the vast transport trains in readiness
to cross the Rapidan.Wagons were massed by thousands at Culpeper, near
where Meade's troops had spent the winter.The work of the teamsters was
most arduous; wearied by long night marches--nodding, reins in hand, for
lack of sleep--they might at any moment be suddenly attacked in a bold
attempt to capture or destroy their precious freight.When the
arrangements were completed, each wagon bore the corps badge, division
color, and number of the brigade it was to serve.Its contents were also
designated, together with the branch of the service for which it was
intended.While loaded, the wagons must keep pace with the army movements
whenever possible in order to be parked at night near the brigades to
which they belonged.[Illustration: THE "GRAND CAMPAIGN" UNDER WAY--THE DAY BEFORE THE BATTLE

under Sedgwick and Warren's Fifth Corps began crossing on the morning of
May 4, 1864.The Second Corps, under Hancock, crossed at Ely's Ford,
farther to the east.The cavalry, under Sheridan, was in advance.By night
the army, with the exception of Burnside's Ninth Corps, was south of the
Rapidan, advancing into the Wilderness.The Ninth Corps (a reserve of
twenty thousand men) remained temporarily north of the Rappahannock,
guarding railway communications.On the wooden pontoon-bridge the
rear-guard is crossing while the pontonniers are taking up the canvas
bridge beyond.The movement was magnificently managed; Grant believed it
to be a complete surprise, as Lee had offered no opposition.In the baffling fighting of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court
House, Grant was to lose a third of his superior number, arriving a month
later on the James with a dispirited army that had left behind 54,926
comrades in a month.[Illustration: THE TANGLED BATTLEFIELD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The Edge of the Wilderness, May 5, 1864.Stretching away to the westward
between Grant's army and Lee's lay no-man's-land--the Wilderness.Covered
with a second-growth of thicket, thorny underbrush, and twisted vines, it
was an almost impassable labyrinth, with here and there small clearings in
which stood deserted barns and houses, reached only by unused and
overgrown farm roads.The Federal advance into this region was not a
surprise to Lee, as Grant supposed.The Confederate commander had caused
the region to be carefully surveyed, hoping for the precise opportunity
that Grant was about to give him.At the very outset of the campaign he
could strike the Federals in a position where superior numbers counted
little.If he could drive Grant beyond the Rappahannock--as he had forced
Pope, Burnside and Hooker before him--says George Cary Eggleston (in the
"History of the Confederate War"), "loud and almost irresistible would
have been the cry for an armistice, supported (as it would have been) by
Wall Street and all Europe."[Illustration: WHERE EWELL'S CHARGE SURPRISED GRANT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]A photograph of Confederate breastworks raised by Ewell's men a few months
before, while they fought in the Wilderness, May 5, 1864.In the picture
we see some of the customary breastworks which both contending armies
threw up to strengthen their positions.These were in a field near the
turnpike in front of Ewell's main line.The impracticable nature of the
ground tore the lines on both sides into fragments; as they swept back and
forth, squads and companies strove fiercely with one another,
hand-to-hand.Grant had confidently expressed the belief to one of his
staff officers that there was no more advance left in Lee's army.He was
surprised to learn on the 5th that Ewell's Corps was marching rapidly down
the Orange turnpike to strike at Sedgwick and Warren, while A. P. Hill,
with Longstreet close behind, was pushing forward on the Orange plank-road
against Hancock.LEE GIVES BLOW FOR BLOW

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Another view of Ewell's advanced entrenchments--the bark still fresh where
the Confederates had worked with the logs.In the Wilderness, Lee, ever
bold and aggressive, executed one of the most brilliant maneuvers of his
career.His advance was a sudden surprise for Grant, and the manner in
which he gave battle was another.Grant harbored the notion that his
adversary would act on the defensive, and that there would be opportunity
to attack the Army of Northern Virginia only behind strong entrenchments.But in the Wilderness, Lee's veterans, the backbone of the South's
fighting strength, showed again their unquenchable spirit of
aggressiveness.They came forth to meet Grant's men on equal terms in the
thorny thickets.About noon, May 5th, the stillness was broken by the
rattle of musketry and the roar of artillery, which told that Warren had
met with resistance on the turnpike and that the battle had begun.Nearly
a mile were Ewell's men driven back, and then they came magnificently on
again, fighting furiously in the smoke-filled thickets with Warren's now
retreating troops.Sedgwick, coming to the support of Warren, renewed the
conflict.To the southward on the plank road, Getty's division, of the
Sixth Corps, hard pressed by the forces of A. P. Hill, was succored by
Hancock with the Second Corps, and together these commanders achieved what
seemed success.It was brief; Longstreet was close at hand to save the day
for the Confederates.TREES IN THE TRACK OF THE IRON STORM

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The Wilderness to the north of the Orange turnpike.Over ground like this,
where men had seldom trod before, ebbed and flowed the tide of trampling
thousands on May 5 and 6, 1864.Artillery, of which Grant had a
superabundance, was well-nigh useless, wreaking its impotent fury upon the
defenseless trees.Even the efficacy of musketry fire was hampered.Men
tripping and falling in the tangled underbrush arose bleeding from the
briars to struggle with an adversary whose every movement was impeded
also.The cold steel of the bayonet finished the work which rifles had
begun.In the terrible turmoil of death the hopes of both Grant and Lee
were doomed to disappointment.Lee,
disregarding his own safety, endeavored to rally the disordered ranks of
A. P. Hill, and could only be persuaded to retire by the pledge of
Longstreet that his advancing force would win the coveted victory.Falling
upon Hancock's flank, the fresh troops seemed about to crush the Second
Corps, as Jackson's men had crushed the Eleventh the previous year at
Chancellorsville.But now, as Jackson, at the critical moment, had fallen
by the fire of his own men, so Longstreet and his staff, galloping along
the plank road, were mistaken by their own soldiers for Federals and fired
upon.A minie-ball struck Longstreet in the shoulder, and he was carried
from the field, feebly waving his hat that his men might know that he was
not killed.With him departed from the field the life of the attack.[Illustration: A LOSS IN "EFFECTIVE STRENGTH"--WOUNDED AT FREDERICKSBURG

perished in the horror of a forest fire on the night of May 5th.The
Federals lost many gallant officers, among them the veteran Wadsworth.The
Confederates lost Generals Jenkins and Jones, killed, and suffered a
staggering blow in the disabling of Longstreet.The series of battles of
the Wilderness and Spotsylvania campaigns were more costly to the Federals
than Antietam and Gettysburg combined.[Illustration: ONE OF GRANT'S FIELD-TELEGRAPH STATIONS IN 1864

excellent idea of the difficulties under which telegraphing was done at
the front or on the march.With a tent-fly for shelter and a hard-tack box
for a table, the resourceful operator mounted his "relay," tested his
wire, and brought the commanding general into direct communication with
separated brigades or divisions.The U. S. Military Telegraph Corps,
through its Superintendent of Construction, Dennis Doren, kept Meade and
both wings of his army in communication from the crossing of the Rapidan
in May, 1864, till the siege of Petersburg.Over this field-line Grant
received daily reports from four separate armies, numbering a quarter of a
million men, and replied with daily directions for their operations over
an area of seven hundred and fifty thousand square miles.Though every
corps of Meade's army moved daily, Doren kept them in touch with
headquarters.The field-line was built of seven twisted, rubber-coated
wires which were hastily strung on trees or fences.TELEGRAPHING FOR THE ARMIES

The man who established the Federal military telegraph system amid the
first horrors of war was to become one of the world's foremost advocates
of peace.As the right hand man of Thomas A. Scott, Assistant Secretary of
War, he came to Washington in '61, and was immediately put in charge of
the field work of reestablishing communication between the Capital and the
North, cut off by the Maryland mobs.A telegraph operator himself, he
inaugurated the system of cipher despatches for the War Department and
secured the trusted operators with whom the service was begun.A young man
of twenty-four at the time, he was one of the last to leave the
battlefield of Bull Run, and his duties of general superintendence over
the network of railroads and telegraph lines made him a witness of war's
cruelties on other fields until he with his chief left the government
service June 1, 1862.THE MILITARY FIELD TELEGRAPH

"No orders ever had to be given to establish the telegraph."Thus wrote
General Grant in his memoirs."The moment troops were in position to go
into camp, the men would put up their wires."Grant pays a glowing tribute
to "the organization and discipline of this body of brave and intelligent
men."[Illustration: THE ARMY SAVING THE NAVY IN MAY, 1864

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration]

Here the army is saving the navy by a brilliant piece of engineering that
prevented the loss of a fleet worth $2,000,000.The Red River expedition
was one of the most humiliating ever undertaken by the Federals.Porter's
fleet, which had so boldly advanced above the falls at Alexandria, was
ordered back, only to find that the river was so low as to imprison twelve
vessels.Lieut.-Colonel Joseph Bailey, acting engineer of the Nineteenth
Corps, obtained permission to build a dam in order to make possible the
passage of the fleet.Begun on April 30, 1864, the work was finished on
the 8th of May, almost entirely by the soldiers, working incessantly day
and night, often up to their necks in water and under the broiling sun.Bailey succeeded in turning the whole current into one channel and the
squadron passed below to safety.Not often have inland lumbermen been the
means of saving a navy.[Illustration: COLONEL JOSEPH BAILEY IN 1864.THE MAN WHO SAVED THE FLEET.]The army engineers laughed at this wide-browed, unassuming man when he
suggested building a dam so as to release Admiral Porter's fleet
imprisoned by low water above the Falls at Alexandria at the close of the
futile Red River expedition in 1864.Bailey had been a lumberman in
Wisconsin and had there gained the practical experience which taught him
that the plan was feasible.He was Acting Chief Engineer of the Nineteenth
Army Corps at this time, and obtained permission to go ahead and build his
dam.In the undertaking he had the approval and earnest support of Admiral
Porter, who refused to consider for a moment the abandonment of any of his
vessels even though the Red River expedition had been ordered to return
and General Banks was chafing at delay and sending messages to Porter that
his troops must be got in motion at once.Bailey pushed on with his work and in eleven days he succeeded in so
raising the water in the channel that all the Federal vessels were able to
pass down below the Falls."Words are inadequate," said Admiral Porter, in
his report, "to express the admiration I feel for the ability of Lieut.This is without doubt the best engineering feat ever
performed.... The highest honors the Government can bestow on Colonel
Bailey can never repay him for the service he has rendered the country."For this achievement Bailey was promoted to colonel, brevetted brigadier
general, voted the thanks of Congress, and presented with a sword and a
purse of $3,000 by the officers of Porter's fleet.He settled in Missouri
after the war and was a formidable enemy of the "Bushwhackers" till he was
shot by them on March 21, 1867.He was born at Salem, Ohio, April 28,
1827.[Illustration: READY FOR HER BAPTISM.COPYRIGHT BY REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This powerful gunboat, the _Lafayette_, though accompanying Admiral Porter
on the Red River expedition, was not one of those entrapped at Alexandria.Her heavy draft precluded her being taken above the Falls.Here we see her
lying above Vicksburg in the spring of 1863.She and her sister ship, the
_Choctaw_, were side-wheel steamers altered into casemate ironclads with
rams.The _Lafayette_ had the stronger armament, carrying two 11-inch
Dahlgrens forward, four 9-inch guns in the broadside, and two 24-pound
howitzers, with two 100-pound Parrott guns astern.She and the _Choctaw_
were the most important acquisitions to Porter's fleet toward the end of
1862.The _Lafayette_ was built and armed for heavy fighting.She got her
first taste of it on the night of April 16, 1863, when Porter took part of
his fleet past the Vicksburg batteries to support Grant's crossing of the
river in an advance on Vicksburg from below.The Lafayette, with a barge
and a transport lashed to her, held her course with difficulty through the
tornado of shot and shell which poured from the Confederate batteries on
the river front in Vicksburg as soon as the movement was discovered.The
_Lafayette_ stood up to this fiery christening and successfully ran the
gantlet, as did all the other vessels save one transport.She was
commanded during the Red River expedition by Lieutenant-Commander J. P.
Foster.[Illustration: FARRAGUT AT THE PINNACLE OF HIS FAME

Assistant Secretary of the Navy, proposed the capture of New Orleans from
the southward he was regarded as utterly foolhardy.All that was needed,
however, to make Fox's plan successful was the man with spirit enough to
undertake it and judgment sufficient to carry it out.Here on the deck of
the fine new sloop-of-war that had been assigned to him as flagship,
stands the man who had just accomplished a greater feat that made him a
world figure as famous as Nelson.The Confederacy had found its great
general among its own people, but the great admiral of the war, although
of Southern birth, had refused to fight against the flag for which, as a
boy in the War of 1812, he had seen men die.Full of the fighting spirit
of the old navy, he was able to achieve the first great victory that gave
new hope to the Federal cause.Percival Drayton was also a Southerner, a
South Carolinian, whose brothers and uncles were fighting for the South.[Illustration: "FAR BY GRAY MORGAN'S WALLS"--THE MOBILE BAY FORT, BATTERED
BY FARRAGUT'S GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]How formidable was Farragut's undertaking in forcing his way into Mobile
Bay is apparent from these photographs.For wooden vessels to pass Morgan
and Gaines, two of the strongest forts on the coast, was pronounced by
experts most foolhardy.Besides, the channel was planted with torpedoes
that might blow the ships to atoms, and within the bay was the Confederate
ram _Tennessee_, thought to be the most powerful ironclad ever put afloat.In the arrangements for the attack, Farragut's flagship, the _Hartford_,
was placed second, the _Brooklyn_ leading the line of battleships, which
were preceded by four monitors.At a quarter before six, on the morning of
August 5th, the fleet moved.Half an hour later it came within range of
Fort Morgan.The
monitor _Tecumseh_, eager to engage the Confederate ram _Tennessee_ behind
the line of torpedoes, ran straight ahead, struck a torpedo, and in a few
minutes went down with most of the crew.As the monitor sank, the
_Brooklyn_ recoiled.Farragut signaled: "What's the trouble?""Torpedoes,"
was the answer."Go ahead, Captain
Drayton.Finding that the smoke from the guns obstructed the
view from the deck, Farragut ascended to the rigging of the main mast,
where he was in great danger of being struck and of falling to the deck.The captain accordingly ordered a quartermaster to tie him in the shrouds.The _Hartford_, under a full head of steam, rushed over the torpedo ground
far in advance of the fleet.The Confederate
ram, invulnerable to the broadsides of the Union guns, steamed alone for
the ships, while the ramparts of the two forts were crowded with
spectators of the coming conflict.The ironclad monster made straight for
the flagship, attempting to ram it and paying no attention to the fire or
the ramming of the other vessels.Its first effort was unsuccessful, but a
second came near proving fatal.It then became a target for the whole
Union fleet; finally its rudder-chain was shot away and it became
unmanageable; in a few minutes it raised the white flag.No wonder
Americans call Farragut the greatest of naval commanders.[Illustration: WHERE BROADSIDES STRUCK]

she steamed in line to the attack of Fort Morgan at Mobile Bay on the
morning of August 5, 1864.Every man was at his station thinking his own
thoughts in the suspense of that moment.On the quarterdeck stood Captain
Percival Drayton and his staff.Near them was the chief-quartermaster,
John H. Knowles, ready to hoist the signals that would convey Farragut's
orders to the fleet.The admiral himself was in the port main shrouds
twenty-five feet above the deck.All was silence aboard till the
"Hartford" was in easy range of the fort.Then the great broadsides of the
old ship began to take their part in the awful cannonade.During the early
part of the action Captain Drayton, fearing that some damage to the
rigging might pitch Farragut overboard, sent Knowles on his famous
mission."I went up," said the old sailor, "with a piece of lead line and
made it fast to one of the forward shrouds, and then took it around the
admiral to the after shroud, making it fast there.The admiral said,
'Never mind, I'm all right,' but I went ahead and obeyed orders."Later
Farragut, undoing the lashing with his own hands, climbed higher still.[Illustration: QUARTERMASTER KNOWLES]

struck twenty times, the "Brooklyn" thirty, the "Octorora" seventeen, the
"Metacomet" eleven, the "Lackawanna" five, the "Ossipee" four, the
"Monongahela" five, the "Kennebec" two, and the "Galena" seven.Of the
monitors the "Chickasaw" was struck three times, the "Manhattan" nine, and
the "Winnebago" nineteen.The total loss in the Federal fleet was 52
killed and 170 wounded, while on the Confederate gunboats 12 were killed
and 20 wounded.The night after the battle the "Metacomet" was turned into
a hospital ship and the wounded of both sides were taken to Pensacola.The
pilot of the captured "Tennessee" guided the Federal ship through the
torpedoes, and as she was leaving Pensacola on her return trip Midshipman
Carter of the "Tennessee," who also was on the "Metacomet," called out
from the wharf: "Don't attempt to fire No.2 gun (of the "Tennessee"), as
there is a shell jammed in the bore, and the gun will burst and kill some
one."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: THE BRAVEST OF THE BRAVE--THE CONFEDERATE IRONCLAD RAM
"TENNESSEE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Mobile Bay, on the morning of August 5, 1864, was the arena of more
conspicuous heroism than marked any naval battle-ground of the entire war.Among all the daring deeds of that day stands out superlatively the
gallant manner in which Admiral Franklin Buchanan, C. S. N., fought his
vessel, the "Tennessee.""You shall not have it to say when you leave this
vessel that you were not near enough to the enemy, for I will meet them,
and then you can fight them alongside of their own ships; and if I fall,
lay me on one side and go on with the fight."Thus Buchanan addressed his
men, and then, taking his station in the pilot-house, he took his vessel
into action.The Federal fleet carried more power for destruction than the
combined English, French, and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar, and yet
Buchanan made good his boast that he would fight alongside.No sooner had
Farragut crossed the torpedoes than Buchanan matched that deed, running
through the entire line of Federal vessels, braving their broadsides, and
coming to close quarters with most of them.Then the "Tennessee" ran under
the guns of Fort Morgan for a breathing space.In half an hour she was
steaming up the bay to fight the entire squadron single-handed.Such
boldness was scarce believable, for Buchanan had now not alone wooden
ships to contend with, as when in the "Merrimac" he had dismayed the
Federals in Hampton Roads.Three powerful monitors were to oppose him at
point-blank range.For nearly an hour the gunners in the "Tennessee"
fought, breathing powder-smoke amid an atmosphere superheated to 120
degrees.Buchanan was serving a gun himself when he was wounded and
carried to the surgeon's table below.Captain Johnston fought on for
another twenty minutes, and then the "Tennessee," with her rudder and
engines useless and unable to fire a gun, was surrendered, after a
reluctant consent had been wrung from Buchanan, as he lay on the operating
table.[Illustration]

THE BATTLE OF SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE

    But to Spotsylvania history will accord the palm, I am sure, for
    having furnished an unexampled muzzle-to-muzzle fire; the longest roll
    of incessant, unbroken musketry; the most splendid exhibition of
    individual heroism and personal daring by large numbers, who, standing
    in the freshly spilt blood of their fellows, faced for so long a
    period and at so short a range the flaming rifles as they heralded the
    decrees of death.It was
    exhibited by both armies, and in that hand-to-hand struggle for the
    possession of the breastworks it seemed almost universal.It would be
    commonplace truism to say that such examples will not be lost to the
    Republic.--_General John B. Gordon, C. S. A., in "Reminiscences of the
    Civil War."_


Immediately after the cessation of hostilities on the 6th of May in the
Wilderness, Grant determined to move his army to Spotsylvania Court House,
and to start the wagon trains on the afternoon of the 7th.Grant's object
was, by a flank move, to get between Lee and Richmond.Lee foresaw Grant's
purpose and also moved his cavalry, under Stuart, across the opponent's
path.As an illustration of the exact science of war we see the two great
military leaders racing for position at Spotsylvania Court House.It was
revealed later that Lee had already made preparations on this field a year
before, in anticipation of its being a possible battle-ground.Apprised of the movement of the Federal trains, Lee, with his usual
sagacious foresight, surmised their destination.He therefore ordered
General R. H. Anderson, now in command of Longstreet's corps, to march to
Spotsylvania Court House at three o'clock on the morning of the 8th.But
the smoke and flames from the burning forests that surrounded Anderson's
camp in the Wilderness made the position untenable, and the march was
begun at eleven o'clock on the night of the 7th.This early start proved
of inestimable value to the Confederates.Anderson's right, in the
Wilderness, rested opposite Hancock's left, and the Confederates secured a
more direct line of march to Spotsylvania, several miles shorter than that
of the Federals.The same night General Ewell at the extreme Confederate
left was ordered to follow Anderson at daylight, if he found no large
force in his front.This order was followed out, there being no opposing
troops, and the corps took the longest route of any of Lee's troops.General Ewell found the march exhausting and distressing on account of the
intense heat and dust and smoke from the burning forests.The Federal move toward Spotsylvania Court House was begun after dark on
the 7th.Warren's corps, in the lead, took the Brock road behind Hancock's
position and was followed by Sedgwick, who marched by way of
Chancellorsville.Burnside came next, but he was halted to guard the
trains.Hancock, covering the move, did not start the head of his command
until some time after daylight.When Warren reached Todd's Tavern he found
the Union cavalry under Merritt in conflict with Fitzhugh Lee's division
of Stuart's cavalry.Warren sent Robinson's division ahead; it drove
Fitzhugh Lee back, and, advancing rapidly, met the head of Anderson's
troops.The leading brigades came to the assistance of the cavalry; Warren
was finally repulsed and began entrenching.The Confederates gained
Spotsylvania Court House.Throughout the day there was continual skirmishing between the troops, as
the Northerners attempted to break the line of the Confederates.Every advance of the blue was repulsed.Lee again
blocked the way of Grant's move.The Federal loss during the day had been
about thirteen hundred, while the Confederates lost fewer men than their
opponents.The work of both was now the construction of entrenchments, which
consisted of earthworks sloping to either side, with logs as a parapet,
and between these works and the opposing army were constructed what are
known as abatis, felled trees, with the branches cut off, the sharp ends
projecting toward the approaching forces.Lee's entrenchments were of such character as to increase the efficiency
of his force.They were formed in the shape of a huge V with the apex
flattened, forming a salient angle against the center of the Federal line.The Confederate lines were facing north, northwest, and northeast, the
corps commanded by Anderson on the left, Ewell in the center, and Early on
the right, the latter temporarily replacing A. P. Hill, who was ill.The
Federals confronting them were Burnside on the left, Sedgwick and Warren
in the center, and Hancock on the right.The day of the 9th was spent in placing the lines of troops, with no
fighting except skirmishing and some sharp-shooting.While placing some
field-pieces, General Sedgwick was hit by a sharpshooter's bullet and
instantly killed.He was a man of high character, a most competent
commander, of fearless courage, loved and lamented by the army.General
Horatio G. Wright succeeded to the command of the Sixth Corps.Early on the morning of the 10th, the Confederates discovered that Hancock
had crossed the Po River in front of his position of the day before and
was threatening their rear.Grant had suspected that Lee was about to move
north toward Fredericksburg, and Hancock had been ordered to make a
reconnaissance with a view to attacking and turning the Confederate left.But difficulties stood in the way of Hancock's performance, and before he
had accomplished much, Meade directed him to send two of his divisions to
assist Warren in making an attack on the Southern lines.The Second Corps
started to recross the Po.Before all were over Early made a vigorous
assault on the rear division, which did not escape without heavy loss.In
this engagement the corps lost the first gun in its most honorable career,
a misfortune deeply lamented by every man in the corps, since up to this
moment it had long been the only one in the entire army which could make
the proud claim of never having lost a gun or a color.But the great event of the 10th was the direct assault upon the
Confederate front.Meade had arranged for Hancock to take charge of this,
and the appointed hour was five in the afternoon.But Warren reported
earlier that the opportunity was most favorable, and he was ordered to
start at once.Wearing his full uniform, the leader of the Fifth Corps
advanced at a quarter to four with the greater portion of his troops.The
progress of the valiant Northerners was one of the greatest difficulty,
owing to the dense wood of low cedar-trees through which they had to make
their way.Longstreet's corps behind their entrenchments acknowledged the
advance with very heavy artillery and musket fire.But Warren's troops did
not falter or pause until some had reached the abatis and others the very
crest of the parapet.A few, indeed, were actually killed inside the
works.All, however, who survived the terrible ordeal were finally driven
back with heavy loss.General James C. Rice was mortally wounded.To the left of Warren, General Wright had observed what he believed to be
a vulnerable spot in the Confederate entrenchments.Behind this particular
place was stationed Doles' brigade of Georgia regiments, and Colonel Emory
Upton was ordered to charge Doles with a column of twelve regiments in
four lines.The ceasing of the Federal artillery at six o'clock was the
signal for the charge, and twenty minutes later, as Upton tells us, "at
command, the lines rose, moved noiselessly to the edge of the wood, and
then, with a wild cheer and faces averted, rushed for the works.Through a
terrible front and flank fire the column advanced quickly, gaining the
parapet.Here occurred a deadly hand-to-hand conflict.The enemy, sitting
in their pits with pieces upright, loaded, and with bayonets fixed ready
to impale the first who should leap over, absolutely refused to yield the
ground.The first of our men who tried to surmount the works fell, pierced
through the head by musket-balls.Others, seeing the fate of their
comrades, held their pieces at arm's length and fired downward, while
others, poising their pieces vertically, hurled them down upon their
enemy, pinning them to the ground.... The struggle lasted but a few
seconds.Numbers prevailed, and like a resistless wave, the column poured
over the works, quickly putting _hors de combat_ those who resisted and
sending to the rear those who surrendered.Pressing forward and expanding
to the right and left, the second line of entrenchments, its line of
battle, and a battery fell into our hands.The column of assault had
accomplished its task."The Confederate line had been shattered and an opening made for expected
support.General Mott, on the left, did
not bring his division forward as had been planned and as General Wright
had ordered.The Confederates were reenforced, and Upton could do no more
than hold the captured entrenchments until ordered to retire.He brought
twelve hundred prisoners and several stands of colors back to the Union
lines; but over a thousand of his own men were killed or wounded.For
gallantry displayed in this charge, Colonel Upton was made
brigadier-general.The losses to the Union army in this engagement at Spotsylvania were over
four thousand.The loss to the Confederates was probably two thousand.The two giant antagonists took a
breathing spell.It was on the morning of this date that Grant penned the
sentence, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer,"
to his chief of staff, General Halleck.During this time Sheridan, who had brought the cavalry up to a state of
great efficiency, was making an expedition to the vicinity of Richmond.He
had said that if he were permitted to operate independently of the army he
would draw Stuart after him.Grant at once gave the order, and Sheridan
made a detour around Lee's army, engaging and defeating the Confederate
cavalry, which he greatly outnumbered, on the 11th of May, at Yellow
Tavern, where General Stuart, the brilliant commander of the Confederate
cavalry, was mortally wounded.Grant carefully went over the ground and decided upon another attack on
the 12th.About four hundred yards of clear ground lay in front of the
sharp angle, or salient, of Lee's lines.After the battle this point was
known as the "Bloody Angle," and also as "Hell's Hole."Here Hancock was
ordered to make an attack at daybreak on the 12th.Lee had been expecting
a move on the part of Grant.On the evening of the 10th he sent to Ewell
this message: "It will be necessary for you to reestablish your whole line
to-night.... Perhaps Grant will make a night attack, as it was a favorite
amusement of his at Vicksburg."Through rain and mud Hancock's force was gotten into position within a few
hundred yards of the Confederate breastworks.He was now between Burnside
and Wright.At the first approach of dawn the four divisions of the Second
Corps, under Birney, Mott, Barlow, and Gibbon (in reserve) moved
noiselessly to the designated point of attack.Without a shot being fired
they reached the Confederate entrenchments, and struck with fury and
impetuosity a mortal blow at the point where least expected, on the
salient, held by General Edward Johnson of Ewell's corps.The movement of
the Federals was so swift and the surprise so complete, that the
Confederates could make practically no resistance, and were forced to
surrender.The artillery had been withdrawn from the earthworks occupied by Johnson's
troops on the previous night, but developments had led to an order to
have it returned early in the morning.It was approaching as the attack
was made.Before the artillerymen could escape or turn the guns upon the
Federals, every cannon had been captured.General Johnson with almost his
whole division, numbering about three thousand, and General Steuart, were
captured, between twenty and thirty colors, and several thousand stands of
arms were taken.Hancock had already distinguished himself as a leader of
his soldiers, and from his magnificent appearance, noble bearing, and
courage had been called "Hancock the Superb," but this was the most
brilliant of his military achievements.Pressing onward across the first defensive line of the Confederates,
Hancock's men advanced against the second series of trenches, nearly half
a mile beyond.As the Federals pushed through the muddy fields they lost
all formation.The Southerners
were prepared for the attack.A volley poured into the throng of blue, and
General Gordon with his reserve division rushed forward, fighting
desperately to drive the Northerners back.As they did so General Lee rode
up, evidently intending to go forward with Gordon.His horse was seized by
one of the soldiers, and for the second time in the campaign the cry arose
from the ranks, "Lee to the rear!"The beloved commander was led back from
the range of fire, while the men, under the inspiration of his example,
rushed forward in a charge that drove the Federals back until they had
reached the outer line of works.Here they fought stubbornly at deadly
range.Neither side was able to force the other back.But Gordon was not
able to cope with the entire attack.Wright and Warren both sent some of
their divisions to reenforce Hancock, and Lee sent all the assistance
possible to the troops struggling so desperately to restore his line at
the salient.Many vivid and picturesque descriptions of this fighting at the angle have
been written, some by eye-witnesses, others by able historians, but no
printed page, no cold type can convey to the mind the realities of that
terrible conflict.The whole engagement was
practically a hand-to-hand contest.The dead lay beneath the feet of the
living, three and four layers deep.This hitherto quiet spot of earth was
devastated and covered with the slain, weltering in their own blood,
mangled and shattered into scarcely a semblance of human form.Dying men
were crushed by horses and many, buried beneath the mire and mud, still
lived.Some artillery was posted on high ground not far from the apex of
the salient, and an incessant fire was poured into the Confederate works
over the Union lines, while other guns kept up an enfilade of canister
along the west of the salient.The contest from the right of the Sixth to the left of the Second Corps
was kept up throughout the day along the whole line.Repeatedly the
trenches had to be cleared of the dead.An oak tree twenty-two inches in
diameter was cut down by musket-balls.Men leaped upon the breastworks,
firing until shot down.The battle of the "angle" is said to have been the most awful in duration
and intensity in modern times.Battle-line after battle-line, bravely
obeying orders, was annihilated.The entrenchments were shivered and
shattered, trunks of trees carved into split brooms.Sometimes the
contestants came so close together that their muskets met, muzzle to
muzzle, and their flags almost intertwined with each other as they waved
in the breeze.As they fought with the desperation of madmen, the living
would stand on the bodies of the dead to reach over the breastworks with
their weapons of slaughter.Lee hurled his army with unparalleled vigor
against his opponent five times during the day, but each time was
repulsed.Until three o'clock the next morning the slaughter continued,
when the Confederates sank back into their second line of entrenchments,
leaving their opponents where they had stood in the morning.All the
fighting on the 12th was not done at the "Bloody Angle."Burnside on the
left of Hancock engaged Early's troops and was defeated, while on the
other side of the salient Wright succeeded in driving Anderson back.The question has naturally arisen why that "salient" was regarded of such
vital importance as to induce the two chief commanders to force their
armies into such a hand-to-hand contest that must inevitably result in
unparalleled and wholesale slaughter.It was manifest, however, that Grant
had shown generalship in finding the weak point in Lee's line for attack.It was imperative that he hold the gain made by his troops.Lee could ill
afford the loss resistance would entail, but he could not withdraw his
army during the day without disaster.The men on both sides seemed to comprehend the gravity of the situation,
that it was a battle to the death for that little point of entrenchment.Without urging by officers, and sometimes without officers, they fell into
line and fought and bled and died in myriads as though inspired by some
unseen power.Here men rushed to their doom with shouts of courage and
eagerness.The pity of it all was manifested by the shocking scene on that
battlefield the next day.Mary travelled to the bathroom.Piles of dead lay around the "Bloody Angle," a
veritable "Hell's Hole" on both sides of the entrenchments, four layers
deep in places, shattered and torn by bullets and hoofs and clubbed
muskets, while beneath the layers of dead, it is said, there could be seen
quivering limbs of those who still lived.General Grant was deeply moved at the terrible loss of life.When he
expressed his regret for the heavy sacrifice of men to General Meade, the
latter replied, "General, we can't do these little tricks without heavy
losses."The total loss to the Union army in killed, wounded, and missing
at Spotsylvania was nearly eighteen thousand.The Confederate losses have
never been positively known, but from the best available sources of
information the number has been placed at not less than nine thousand men.Lee's loss in high officers was very severe, the killed including General
Daniel and General Perrin, while Generals Walker, Ramseur, R. D. Johnston,
and McGowan were severely wounded.In addition to the loss of these
important commanders, Lee was further crippled in efficient commanders by
the capture of Generals Edward Johnson and Steuart.The Union loss in high
officers was light, excepting General Sedgwick on the 9th.General Webb
was wounded, and Colonel <DW53>, of the Second Corps, was killed.Lee's forces had been handled with such consummate skill as to make them
count one almost for two, and there was the spirit of devotion for Lee
among his soldiers which was indeed practically hero-worship.All in all,
he had an army, though shattered and worn, that was almost unconquerable.Grant found that ordinary methods of war, even such as he had experienced
in the West, were not applicable to the Army of Northern Virginia.The
only hope for the Union army was a long-drawn-out process, and with larger
numbers, better kept, and more often relieved, Grant's army would
ultimately make that of Lee's succumb, from sheer exhaustion and
disintegration.The battle was not terminated on the 12th.During the next five days there
was a continuous movement of the Union corps to the east which was met by
a corresponding readjustment of the Confederate lines.After various
maneuvers, Hancock was ordered to the point where the battle was fought on
the 12th, and on the 18th and 19th, the last effort was made to break the
lines of the Confederates.Ewell, however, drove the Federals back and the
next day he had a severe engagement with the Union left wing, while
endeavoring to find out something of Grant's plans.Twelve days of active effort were thus spent in skirmishing, fighting, and
countermarching.In the last two engagements the Union losses were nearly
two thousand, which are included in those before stated.It was decided to
abandon the attempt to dislodge Lee from his entrenchments, and to move
to the North Anna River.On the 20th of May the march was resumed.The men
had suffered great hardships from hunger, exposure, and incessant action,
and many would fall asleep on the line of march.On the day after the start, Hancock crossed the Mattapony River at one
point and Warren at another.Hancock was ordered to take position on the
right bank and, if practicable, to attack the Confederates wherever found.By the 22d, Wright and Burnside came up and the march proceeded.But the
vigilant Lee had again detected the plans of his adversary.Meade's army had barely started in its purpose to turn the Confederates'
flank when the Southern forces were on the way to block the army of the
North.As on the march from the Wilderness to Spotsylvania, Lee's troops
took the shorter route, along main roads, and reached the North Anna ahead
of the Federals.Warren's corps was the first of Meade's army to arrive at
the north bank of the river, which it did on the afternoon of May 23d.Lee
was already on the south bank, but Warren crossed without opposition.No
sooner had he gotten over, however, than he was attacked by the
Confederates and a severe but undecisive engagement followed.The next
morning (the 24th) Hancock and Wright put their troops across at places
some miles apart, and before these two wings of the army could be joined,
Lee made a brilliant stroke by marching in between them, forming a wedge
whose point rested on the bank, opposite the Union center, under Burnside,
which had not yet crossed the river.The Army of the Potomac was now in three badly separated parts.Burnside
could not get over in sufficient strength to reenforce the wings, and all
attempts by the latter to aid him in so doing met with considerable
disaster.The loss in these engagements approximated two thousand on each
side.On the 25th, Sheridan and his cavalry rejoined the army.They had been
gone since the 9th and their raid was most successful.Besides the
decisive victory over the Confederate cavalry at Yellow Tavern, they had
destroyed several depots of supplies, four trains of cars, and many miles
of railroad track.Nearly four hundred Federal prisoners on their way to
Richmond had been rescued from their captors.The dashing cavalrymen had
even carried the first line of work around Richmond, and had made a detour
down the James to communicate with General Butler.Grant was highly
satisfied with Sheridan's performance.It had been of the greatest
assistance to him, as it had drawn off the whole of the Confederate
cavalry, and made the guarding of the wagon trains an easy matter.But here, on the banks of the North Anna, Grant had been completely
checkmated by Lee.He realized this and decided on a new move, although he
still clung to his idea of turning the Confederate right.The Federal
wings were withdrawn to the north side of the river during the night of
May 26th and the whole set in motion for the Pamunkey River at
Hanovertown.Two divisions of Sheridan's cavalry and Warren's corps were
in advance.Lee lost no time in pursuing his great antagonist, but for the
first time the latter was able to hold his lead.Along the Totopotomoy, on
the afternoon of May 28th, infantry and cavalry of both armies met in a
severe engagement in which the strong position of Lee's troops again
foiled Grant's purpose.The Union would have to try at some other point,
and on the 31st Sheridan's cavalry took possession of Cold Harbor.This
was to be the next battle-ground.[Illustration: IN THE AUTUMN OF 1863--GRANT'S CHANGING EXPRESSIONS]

Although secure in his fame as the conqueror of Vicksburg, Grant still has
the greater part of his destiny to fulfil as he faces the camera.Before
him lie the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and the slow investment
of Petersburg.This series forms a particularly interesting study in
expression.At the left hand, the face looks almost amused.In the next
the expression is graver, the mouth close set.The third picture looks
plainly obstinate, and in the last the stern fighter might have been
declaring, as in the following spring: "I propose to fight it out on this
line if it takes all summer."The eyes, first unveiled fully in this
fourth view, are the unmistakable index to Grant's stern inflexibility,
once his decision was made.[Illustration: IN THE AUTUMN OF 1864--AFTER THE STRAIN OF THE WILDERNESS
CAMPAIGN]

Here is a furrowed brow above eyes worn by pain.In the pictures of the
previous year the forehead is more smooth, the expression grave yet
confident.Here the expression is that of a man who has won, but won at a
bitter cost.It is the memory of the 50,000 men whom he left in the
Wilderness campaign and at Cold Harbor that has lined this brow, and
closed still tighter this inflexible mouth.Again, as in the series above,
the eyes are not revealed until the last picture.Then again flashes the
determination of a hero.The great general's biographers say that Grant
was a man of sympathy and infinite pity.It was the more difficult for
him, spurred on to the duty by grim necessity, to order forward the lines
in blue that withered, again and again, before the Confederate fire, but
each time weakened the attenuated line which confronted them.[Illustration: MEADE AND SEDGWICK--BEFORE THE ADVANCE THAT BROUGHT

of the civilian who had brought his new-fangled photographic apparatus
into camp suggested a joke.A couple of months later, on the 9th of May,
Sedgwick again was jesting--before Spotsylvania Court House.McMahon of
his staff had begged him to avoid passing some artillery exposed to the
Confederate fire, to which Sedgwick had playfully replied, "McMahon, I
would like to know who commands this corps, you or I?"Then he ordered
some infantry before him to shift toward the right.Their movement drew
the fire of the Confederates.The lines were close together; the situation
tense.A sharpshooter's bullet whistled--Sedgwick fell.He was taken to
Meade's headquarters.The Army of the Potomac had lost another corps
commander, and the Union a brilliant and courageous soldier.[Illustration: SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE

WHERE GRANT WANTED TO "FIGHT IT OUT"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]For miles around this quaint old village-pump surged the lines of two vast
contending armies, May 8-12, 1864.In this picture of only a few months
later, the inhabitants have returned to their accustomed quiet, although
the reverberations of battle have hardly died away.But on May 7th
Generals Grant and Meade, with their staffs, had started toward the little
courthouse.As they passed along the Brock Road in the rear of Hancock's
lines, the men broke into loud hurrahs.They saw that the movement was
still to be southward.But chance had caused Lee to choose the same
objective.Misinterpreting Grant's movement as a retreat upon
Fredericksburg, he sent Longstreet's corps, now commanded by Anderson, to
Spotsylvania.Chance again, in the form of a forest fire, drove Anderson
to make, on the night of May 7th, the march from the Wilderness that he
had been ordered to commence on the morning of the 8th.On that day, while
Warren was contending with the forces of Anderson, Lee's whole army was
entrenching on a ridge around Spotsylvania Court House."Accident," says
Grant, "often decides the fate of battle."But this "accident" was one of
Lee's master moves.[Illustration: THE APEX OF THE BATTLEFIELD

old dwelling as it was on May 12th, when the fighting was at flood tide
all round it; and below, the Confederate entrenchments near that
blood-drenched spot.At a point in these Confederate lines in advance of
the McCool house, the entrenchments had been thrown forward like the
salient of a fort, and the wedge-shaped space within them was destined to
become renowned as the "Bloody Angle."The position was defended by the
famous "Stonewall Division" of the Confederates under command of General
Edward Johnson.It was near the scene of Upton's gallant charge on the
10th.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.Here at daybreak on May 12th the divisions of the intrepid Barlow
and Birney, sent forward by Hancock, stole a march upon the unsuspecting
Confederates.Leaping over the breastworks the Federals were upon them and
the first of the terrific hand-to-hand conflicts that marked the day
began.It ended in victory for Hancock's men, into whose hands fell 20
cannon, 30 standards and 4,000 prisoners, "the best division in the
Confederate army."[Illustration: CONFEDERATE ENTRENCHMENTS NEAR "BLOODY ANGLE"]

Flushed with success, the Federals pressed on to Lee's second line of
works, where Wilcox's division of the Confederates held them until
reenforcements sent by Lee from Hill and Anderson drove them back.On the
Federal side the Sixth Corps, with Upton's brigade in the advance, was
hurried forward to hold the advantage gained.But Lee himself was on the
scene, and the men of the gallant Gordon's division, pausing long enough
to seize and turn his horse, with shouts of "General Lee in the rear,"
hurtled forward into the conflict.In five separate charges by the
Confederates the fighting came to close quarters.With bayonets, clubbed
muskets, swords and pistols, men fought within two feet of one another on
either side of the entrenchments at "Bloody Angle" till night at last left
it in possession of the Federals.None of the fighting near Spotsylvania
Court House was inglorious.On the 10th, after a day of strengthening
positions on both sides, young Colonel Emory Upton of the 121st New York,
led a storming party of twelve regiments into the strongest of the
Confederate entrenchments.For his bravery Grant made him a
brigadier-general on the field.[Illustration: UNION ARTILLERY MASSING FOR THE ADVANCE THAT EWELL'S ATTACK

Confederate General Ewell had chosen the 18th to make an attack on the
right flank.It not only delayed the departure but forced a change in the
intended positions of the division as they had been contemplated by the
commander-in-chief.Beverly House is where General Warren pitched his
headquarters after Spotsylvania, and the spectator is looking toward the
battlefield that lies beyond the distant woods.After Ewell's attack,
Warren again found himself on the right flank, and at this very moment the
main body of the Federal army is passing in the rear of him.The costly
check at Spotsylvania, with its wonderful display of fighting on both
sides, had in its apparently fruitless results called for the display of
all Grant's gifts as a military leader.It takes but little imagination to
supply color to this photograph; it is full of it--full of the movement
and detail of war also.It is springtime; blossoms have just left the
trees and the whole country is green and smiling, but the earth is scarred
by thousands of trampling feet and hoof-prints.Ugly ditches cross the
landscape; the debris of an army marks its onsweep from one battlefield to
another.[Illustration: THE ONES WHO NEVER CAME BACK

picture with a shudder of horror, but it is no morbid curiosity that will
cause them to study it closely.If pictures such as this were familiar
everywhere there would soon be an end of war.We can realize money by
seeing it expressed in figures; we can realize distances by miles, but
some things in their true meaning can only be grasped and impressions
formed with the seeing eye.Visualizing only this small item of the awful
cost--the cost beside which money cuts no figure--an idea can be gained of
what war is.Here is a sermon in the cause of universal peace.The
handsome lad lying with outstretched arms and clinched fingers is a mute
plea.Death has not disfigured him--he lies in an attitude of relaxation
and composure.Perhaps in some Southern home this same face is pictured in
the old family album, alert and full of life and hope, and here is the
end.Does there not come to the mind the insistent question, "Why?"The
Federal soldiers standing in the picture are not thinking of all this, it
may be true, but had they meditated in the way that some may, as they gaze
at this record of death, it would be worth their while.One of the men is
apparently holding a sprig of blossoms in his hand.[Illustration: IN ONE LONG BURIAL TRENCH

bitterness exists in moments such as these.What soldier in the party
knows but what it may be his turn next to lie beside other lumps of clay
and join his earth-mother in this same fashion in his turn.But men become
used to work of any kind, and these men digging up the warm spring soil,
when their labor is concluded, are neither oppressed nor nerve-shattered
by what they have seen and done.They have lost the power of experiencing
sensation.Senses become numbed in a measure; the value of life itself
from close and constant association with death is minimized almost to the
vanishing point.In half an hour these very men may be singing and
laughing as if war and death were only things to be expected, not reasoned
over in the least.[Illustration: ONE OF THE FEARLESS CONFEDERATES]

artillery and an enfilading fire from rifle-pits across the river.Late in
the evening of the 23d, Hancock's corps, arriving before the redoubt, had
assaulted it with two brigades and easily carried it.During the night the
Confederates from the other side made two attacks upon the bridge and
finally succeeded in setting it afire.The flames were extinguished by the
Federals, and on the 24th Hancock's troops crossed over without
opposition.The easy crossing of the Federals here was but another example
of Lee's favorite rule to let his antagonist attack him on the further
side of a stream.Taylor's Bridge could easily have been held by Lee for a
much longer time, but its ready abandonment was part of the tactics by
which Grant was being led into a military dilemma.In the picture the
Federal soldiers confidently hold the captured redoubt, convinced that the
possession of it meant that they had driven Lee to his last corner.[Illustration: "WALK YOUR HORSES"

they had to run the gantlet of musketry and artillery fire from the
opposite bank.Several regiments of New York heavy artillery poured across
the structure at the double-quick with the hostile shells bursting about
their heads.When Captain Sleeper's Eighteenth Massachusetts battery began
crossing, the Confederate cannoneers redoubled their efforts to blow up
the ammunition by well-aimed shots.Sleeper passed over only one piece at
a time in order to diminish the target and enforce the observance of the
local law by walking his horses!The Second Corps got no further than the
ridge beyond, where Lee's strong V formation held it from further
advance.[Illustration: A SANITARY-COMMISSION NURSE AND HER PATIENTS AT

accidents; lastly, and chiefly, gunshot wounds.The war came prior to the
demonstration of the fact that the causes of disease and suppurative
conditions are living organisms of microscopic size.Septicemia,
erysipelas, lockjaw, and gangrene were variously attributed to dampness
and a multitude of other conditions.[Illustration: A CHANGE OF BASE--THE CAVALRY SCREEN

Spottsylvania, Grant ordered the change of base from the Rappahannock to
McClellan's former starting-point, White House on the Pamunkey.The
control of the waterways, combined with Sheridan's efficient use of the
cavalry, made this an easy matter.Torbert's division encountered Gordon's
brigade of Confederate cavalry at Hanovertown and drove it in the
direction of Hanover Court House.Gregg's division moved up to this line;
Russell's division of infantry encamped near the river-crossing in
support, and behind the mask thus formed the Army of the Potomac crossed
the Pamunkey on May 28th unimpeded.Gregg was then ordered to reconnoiter
towards Mechanicsville, and after a severe fight at Hawes' shop he
succeeded (with the assistance of Custer's brigade) in driving Hampton's
and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry divisions and Butler's brigade from the field.Although the battle took place immediately in front of the Federal
infantry, General Meade declined to put the latter into action, and the
battle was won by the cavalry alone.COLD HARBOR

    Cold Harbor is, I think, the only battle I ever fought that I would
    not fight over again under the circumstances.I have always regretted
    that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made.--_General U. S.
    Grant in his "Memoirs."_


According to Grant's well-made plans of march, the various corps of the
Army of the Potomac set out from the banks of the North Anna on the night
of May 26, 1864, at the times and by the routes assigned to them.Early on
the morning of May 27th Lee set his force in motion by the Telegraph road
and such others as were available, across the Little and South Anna rivers
toward Ashland and Atlee's Station on the Virginia Central Railroad.Thus the armies were stretched like two live wires along the swampy
bottom-lands of eastern Virginia, and as they came in contact, here and
there along the line, there were the inevitable sputterings of flame and
considerable destruction wrought.The advance Federal infantry crossed the
Pamunkey, after the cavalry, at Hanoverstown, early on May 28th.The
Second Corps was close behind the Sixth; the Fifth was over by noon, while
the Ninth, now an integral portion of the Army of the Potomac, passed the
river by midnight.On the 31st General Sheridan reached Cold Harbor, which Meade had ordered
him to hold at all hazards.This place, probably named after the old home
of some English settler, was not a town but the meeting-place of several
roads of great strategic importance to the Federal army.They led not only
toward Richmond by the way of the upper Chickahominy bridges, but in the
direction of White House Landing, on the Pamunkey River.Both Lee and Meade had received reenforcements--the former by
Breckinridge, and the scattered forces in western Virginia, and by Pickett
and Hoke from North Carolina.From Bermuda Hundred where General Butler
was "bottled up"--to use a phrase which Grant employed and afterward
regretted--General W. F. Smith was ordered to bring the Eighteenth Corps
of the Army of the James to the assistance of Meade, since Butler could
defend his position perfectly well with a small force, and could make no
headway against Beauregard with a large one.Grant had now nearly one
hundred and fourteen thousand troops and Lee about eighty thousand.Sheridan's appearance at Cold Harbor was resented in vain by Fitzhugh Lee,
and the next morning, June 1st, the Sixth Corps arrived, followed by
General Smith and ten thousand men of the Eighteenth, who had hastened
from the landing-place at White House.These took position on the right of
the Sixth, and the Federal line was promptly faced by Longstreet's corps,
a part of A. P. Hill's, and the divisions of Hoke and Breckinridge.At six
o'clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith advanced to the attack, which
Hoke and Kershaw received with courage and determination.The Confederate
line was broken in several places, but before night checked the struggle
the Southerners had in some degree regained their position.The short
contest was a severe one for the Federal side.Wright lost about twelve
hundred men and Smith one thousand.The following day the final dispositions were made for the mighty struggle
that would decide Grant's last chance to interpose between Lee and
Richmond.Hancock and the Second Corps arrived at Cold Harbor and took
position on the left of General Wright.Burnside, with the Ninth Corps,
was placed near Bethesda Church on the road to Mechanicsville, while
Warren, with the Fifth, came to his left and connected with Smith's right.Sheridan was sent to hold the lower Chickahominy bridges and to cover the
road to White House, which was now the base of supplies.On the Southern
side Ewell's corps, now commanded by General Early, faced Burnside's and
Warren's.Longstreet's corps, still under Anderson, was opposite Wright
and Smith, while A. P. Hill, on the extreme right, confronted Hancock.There was sharp fighting during the entire day, but Early did not succeed
in getting upon the Federal right flank, as he attempted to do.Both armies lay very close to each other and were well entrenched.Lee was
naturally strong on his right, and his left was difficult of access, since
it must be approached through wooded swamps.Well-placed batteries made
artillery fire from front and both flanks possible, but Grant decided to
attack the whole Confederate front, and word was sent to the corps
commanders to assault at half-past four the following morning.The hot sultry weather of the preceding days had brought much suffering.The movement of troops and wagons raised clouds of dust which settled down
upon the sweltering men and beasts.But five o'clock on the afternoon of
June 2d brought the grateful rain, and this continued during the night,
giving great relief to the exhausted troops.At the hour designated the Federal lines moved promptly from their shallow
rifle-pits toward the Confederate works.The main assault was made by the
Second, Sixth, and Eighteenth corps.With determined and firm step they
started to cross the space between the opposing entrenchments.The silence
of the dawning summer morning was broken by the screams of musket-ball and
canister and shell.That move of the Federal battle-line opened the fiery
furnace across the intervening space, which was, in the next instant, a
Vesuvius, pouring tons and tons of steel and lead into the moving human
mass.From front, from right and left, artillery crashed and swept the
field, musketry and grape hewed and mangled and mowed down the line of
blue as it moved on its approach.Meade issued orders for the suspension of all further offensive
operations.A word remains to be said as to fortunes of Burnside's and Warren's
forces, which were on the Federal right.Generals Potter and Willcox of
the Ninth Corps made a quick capture of Early's advanced rifle-pits and
were waiting for the order to advance on his main entrenchments, when the
order of suspension arrived.Early fell upon him later in the day but was
repulsed.Warren, on the left of Burnside, drove Rodes' division back and
repulsed Gordon's brigade, which had attacked him.The commander of the
Fifth Corps reported that his line was too extended for further operations
and Birney's division was sent from the Second Corps to his left.But by
the time this got into position the battle of Cold Harbor was practically
over.The losses to the Federal army in this battle and the engagements which
preceded it were over seventeen thousand, while the Confederate loss did
not exceed one-fifth of that number.Grant had failed in his plan to
destroy Lee north of the James River, and saw that he must now cross it.Thirty days had passed in the campaign since the Wilderness and the grand
total in losses to Grant's army in killed, wounded, and missing was
54,929.The losses in Lee's army were never accurately given, but they
were very much less in proportion to the numerical strength of the two
armies.If Grant had inflicted punishment upon his foe equal to that
suffered by the Federal forces, Lee's army would have been practically
annihilated.The Federal general-in-chief had decided to secure Petersburg and confront
Lee once more.General Gillmore was sent by Butler, with cavalry and
infantry, on June 10th to make the capture, but was unsuccessful.Thereupon General Smith and the Eighteenth Corps were despatched to White
House Landing to go forward by water and reach Petersburg before Lee had
time to reenforce it.[Illustration: READY FOR THE ADVANCE THAT LEE DROVE BACK

wings of the Army of the Potomac.But when the center under Burnside was
driven back and severely handled at Ox Ford, Grant immediately detached a
brigade each from Hancock and Warren to attack the apex of Lee's wedge on
the south bank of the river, but the position was too strong to justify
the attempt.Then it dawned upon the Federal general-in-chief that Lee had
cleaved the Army of the Potomac into two separated bodies.To reenforce
either wing would require two crossings of the river, while Lee could
quickly march troops from one side to the other within his impregnable
wedge.As Grant put it in his report, "To make a direct attack from either
wing would cause a slaughter of our men that even success would not
justify."[Illustration: IMPROVISED BREASTWORKS

Confederate lines at Cold Harbor is an example of the crude protection
resorted to by the soldiers on both sides in advance or retreat.A
momentary lull in the battle was invariably employed in strengthening each
position.Trees were felled under fire, and fence rails gathered quickly
were piled up to make possible another stand.The space between the lines
at Cold Harbor was so narrow at many points as to resemble a road,
encumbered with the dead and wounded.This extraordinary proximity induced
a nervous alertness which made the troops peculiarly sensitive to night
alarms; even small parties searching quietly for wounded comrades might
begin a panic.A few scattering shots were often enough to start a heavy
and continuous musketry fire and a roar of artillery along the entire
line.It was a favorite ruse of the Federal soldiers to aim their muskets
carefully to clear the top of the Confederate breastworks and then set up
a great shout.The Confederates, deceived into the belief that an attack
was coming, would spring up and expose themselves to the well-directed
volley which thinned their ranks.COLD HARBOR

of Grant's campaign against Richmond within a month.It was also his
costliest onset on Lee's veteran army.Grant had risked much in his change
of base to the James in order to bring him nearer to Richmond and to the
friendly hand which Butler with the Army of the James was in a position to
reach out to him.Lee had again confronted him, entrenching himself but
six miles from the outworks of Richmond, while the Chickahominy cut off
any further flanking movement.There was nothing to do but fight it out,
and Grant ordered an attack all along the line.On June 3d he hurled the
Army of the Potomac against the inferior numbers of Lee, and in a brave
assault upon the Confederate entrenchments, lost ten thousand men in
twenty minutes.[Illustration: FEDERAL CAMP AT COLD HARBOR AFTER THE BATTLE

Hancock's division and of the brigades of Gibbon and Barlow, who on the
left of the Federal line charged up the ascent in their front upon the
concentrated artillery of the Confederates; they took the position and
held it for a moment under a galling fire, which finally drove them back,
but not until they had captured a flag and three hundred prisoners.The
battle was substantially over by half-past seven in the morning, but
sullen fighting continued throughout the day.About noontime General
Grant, who had visited all the corps commanders to see for himself the
positions gained and what could be done, concluded that the Confederates
were too strongly entrenched to be dislodged and ordered that further
offensive action should cease.All the next day the dead and wounded lay
on the field uncared for while both armies warily watched each other.The
lower picture was taken during this weary wait.Not till the 7th was a
satisfactory truce arranged, and then all but two of the wounded Federals
had died.No wonder that Grant wrote, "I have always regretted that the
last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made."[Illustration: THE BUSIEST PLACE IN DIXIE

the last campaign of starvation against numbers and plenty.[Illustration: THE FORCES AT LAST JOIN HANDS

hazardous one.More than fifty miles intervened between him and Butler by
the roads he would have to travel, and he had to cross both the
Chickahominy and the James, which were unbridged.The paramount difficulty
was to get the Army of the Potomac out of its position before Lee, who
confronted it at Cold Harbor.Lee had the shorter line and better roads to
move over and meet Grant at the Chickahominy, or he might, if he chose,
descend rapidly on Butler and crush him before Grant could unite with him."But," says Grant, "the move had to be made, and I relied upon Lee's not
seeing my danger as I saw it."Near the old Charles City Court House the
crossing of the James was successfully accomplished, and on the 14th Grant
took steamer and ran up the river to Bermuda Hundred to see General Butler
and direct the movement against Petersburg, that began the final
investment of that city.[Illustration: THE MONITOR IN A STORM._Painted by Robert Hopkin._

TO ATLANTA

    Johnston was an officer who, by the common consent of the military men
    of both sides, was reckoned second only to Lee, if second, in the
    qualities which fit an officer for the responsibility of great
    commands.... He practised a lynx-eyed watchfulness of his adversary,
    tempting him constantly to assault his entrenchments, holding his
    fortified positions to the last moment, but choosing that last moment
    so well as to save nearly every gun and wagon in the final withdrawal,
    and always presenting a front covered by such defenses that one man in
    the line was, by all sound military rules, equal to three or four in
    the attack.In this way he constantly neutralized the superiority of
    force his opponent wielded, and made his campaign from Dalton to the
    Chattahoochee a model of defensive warfare.It is Sherman's glory
    that, with a totally different temperament, he accepted his
    adversary's game, and played it with a skill that was finally
    successful, as we shall see.--_Major-General Jacob D. Cox, U. S. V.,
    in "Atlanta."_


The two leading Federal generals of the war, Grant and Sherman, met at
Nashville, Tennessee, on March 17, 1864, and arranged for a great
concerted double movement against the two main Southern armies, the Army
of Northern Virginia and the Army of Tennessee.Grant, who had been made
commander of all the Federal armies, was to take personal charge of the
Army of the Potomac and move against Lee, while to Sherman, whom, at
Grant's request, President Lincoln had placed at the head of the Military
Division of the Mississippi, he turned over the Western army, which was to
proceed against Johnston.It was decided, moreover, that the two movements were to be simultaneous
and that they were to begin early in May.Sherman concentrated his forces
around Chattanooga on the Tennessee River, where the Army of the
Cumberland had spent the winter, and where a decisive battle had been
fought some months before, in the autumn of 1863.His army was composed of
three parts, or, more properly, of three armies operating in concert.These were the Army of the Tennessee, led by General James B. McPherson;
the Army of Ohio, under General John M. Schofield, and the Army of the
Cumberland, commanded by General George H. Thomas.The last named was much
larger than the other two combined.The triple army aggregated the grand
total of ninety-nine thousand men, six thousand of whom were cavalrymen,
while four thousand four hundred and sixty belonged to the artillery.There were two hundred and fifty-four heavy guns.Soon to be pitted against Sherman's army was that of General Joseph E.
Johnston, which had spent the winter at Dalton, in the State of Georgia,
some thirty miles southeast of Chattanooga.It was by chance that Dalton
became the winter quarters of the Confederate army.In the preceding
autumn, when General Bragg had been defeated on Missionary Ridge and
driven from the vicinity of Chattanooga, he retreated to Dalton and
stopped for a night's rest.Discovering the next morning that he was not
pursued, he there remained.Some time later he was superseded by General
Johnston.By telegraph, General Sherman was apprised of the time when Grant was to
move upon Lee on the banks of the Rapidan, in Virginia, and he prepared to
move his own army at the same time.But he was two days behind Grant, who
began his Virginia campaign on May 4th.Sherman broke camp on the 6th and
led his legions across hill and valley, forest and stream, toward the
Confederate stronghold.Nature was all abloom with the opening of a
Southern spring and the soldiers, who had long chafed under their enforced
idleness, now rejoiced at the exhilarating journey before them, though
their mission was to be one of strife and bloodshed.Johnston's army numbered about fifty-three thousand, and was divided into
two corps, under the respective commands of Generals John B. Hood and
William J. Hardee.But General Polk was on his way to join them, and in a
few days Johnston had in the neighborhood of seventy thousand men.His
position at Dalton was too strong to be carried by a front attack, and
Sherman was too wise to attempt it.Leaving Thomas and Schofield to make a
feint at Johnston's front, Sherman sent McPherson on a flanking movement
by the right to occupy Snake Creek Gap, a mountain pass near Resaca, which
is about eighteen miles below Dalton.Sherman, with the main part of the army, soon occupied Tunnel Hill, which
faces Rocky Face Ridge, an eastern range of the Cumberland Mountains,
north of Dalton, on which a large part of Johnston's army was posted.The
Federal leader had little or no hope of dislodging his great antagonist
from this impregnable position, fortified by rocks and cliffs which no
army could scale while under fire.But he ordered that demonstrations be
made at several places, especially at a pass known as Rocky Face Gap.This
was done with great spirit and bravery, the men clambering over rocks and
across ravines in the face of showers of bullets and even of masses of
stone hurled down from the heights above them.On the whole they won but
little advantage.During the 8th and 9th of May, these operations were continued, the
Federals making but little impression on the Confederate stronghold.Meanwhile, on the Dalton road there was a sharp cavalry fight, the Federal
commander, General E. M. McCook, having encountered General Wheeler.McCook's advance brigade under Colonel La Grange was defeated and La
Grange was made prisoner.Sherman's chief object in these demonstrations, it will be seen, was so to
engage Johnston as to prevent his intercepting McPherson in the latter's
movement upon Resaca.In this Sherman was successful, and by the 11th he
was giving his whole energy to moving the remainder of his forces by the
right flank, as McPherson had done, to Resaca, leaving a detachment of
General O. O. Howard's Fourth Corps to occupy Dalton when evacuated.When
Johnston discovered this, he was quick to see that he must abandon his
entrenchments and intercept Sherman.Moving by the only two good roads,
Johnston beat Sherman in the race to Resaca.The town had been fortified,
owing to Johnston's foresight, and McPherson had failed to dislodge the
garrison and capture it.The Confederate army was now settled behind its
entrenchments, occupying a semicircle of low wooded hills, both flanks of
the army resting on the banks of the Oostenaula River.On the morning of May 14th, the Confederate works were invested by the
greater part of Sherman's army and it was evident that a battle was
imminent.The attack was begun about noon, chiefly by the Fourteenth Army
Corps under Palmer, of Thomas' army, and Judah's division of Schofield's.General Hindman's division of Hood's corps bore the brunt of this attack
and there was heavy loss on both sides.Later in the day, a portion of
Hood's corps was massed in a heavy column and hurled against the Federal
left, driving it back.But at this point the Twentieth Army Corps under
Hooker, of Thomas' army, dashed against the advancing Confederates and
pushed them back to their former lines.The forenoon of the next day was spent in heavy skirmishing, which grew to
the dignity of a battle.During the day's operations a hard fight for a
Confederate lunette on the top of a low hill occurred.At length, General
Butterfield, in the face of a galling fire, succeeded in capturing the
position.But so deadly was the fire from Hardee's corps that Butterfield
was unable to hold it or to remove the four guns the lunette contained.With the coming of night, General Johnston determined to withdraw his army
from Resaca.The battle had cost each army nearly three thousand men.While it was in progress, McPherson, sent by Sherman, had deftly marched
around Johnston's left with the view of cutting off his retreat south by
seizing the bridges across the Oostenaula, and at the same time the
Federal cavalry was threatening the railroad to Atlanta which ran beyond
the river.It was the knowledge of these facts that determined the
Confederate commander to abandon Resaca.Withdrawing during the night, he
led his army southward to the banks of the Etowah River.Sherman followed
but a few miles behind him.At the same time Sherman sent a division of
the Army of the Cumberland, under General Jeff.C. Davis, to Rome, at the
junction of the Etowah and the Oostenaula, where there were important
machine-shops and factories.Davis captured the town and several heavy
guns, destroyed the factories, and left a garrison to hold it.Sherman was eager for a battle in the open with Johnston and on the 17th,
near the town of Adairsville, it seemed as if the latter would gratify
him.Johnston chose a good position, posted his cavalry, deployed his
infantry, and awaited combat.The skirmishing
for some hours almost amounted to a battle.But suddenly Johnston decided
to defer a conclusive contest to another time.Again at Cassville, a few days later, Johnston drew up the Confederate
legions in battle array, evidently having decided on a general engagement
at this point.He issued a spirited address to the army: "By your courage
and skill you have repulsed every assault of the enemy.... You will now
turn and march to meet his advancing columns.... I lead you to battle."But, when his right flank had been turned by a Federal attack, and when
two of his corps commanders, Hood and Polk, advised against a general
battle, Johnston again decided on postponement.He retreated in the night
across the Etowah, destroyed the bridges, and took a strong position among
the rugged hills about Allatoona Pass, extending south to Kenesaw
Mountain.Johnston's decision to fight and then not to fight was a cause for
grumbling both on the part of his army and of the inhabitants of the
region through which he was passing.His men were eager to defend their
country, and they could not understand this Fabian policy.They would have
preferred defeat to these repeated retreats with no opportunity to show
what they could do.Johnston, however, was wiser than his critics.The Union army was larger
by far and better equipped than his own, and Sherman was a
master-strategist.His hopes rested on two or three contingencies that he
might catch a portion of Sherman's army separated from the rest; that
Sherman would be so weakened by the necessity of guarding the long line of
railroad to his base of supplies at Chattanooga, Nashville, and even
far-away Louisville, as to make it possible to defeat him in open battle,
or, finally, that Sherman might fall into the trap of making a direct
attack while Johnston was in an impregnable position, and in such a
situation he now was.Not yet, however, was Sherman inclined to fall into such a trap, and when
Johnston took his strong position at and beyond Allatoona Pass, the
Northern commander decided, after resting his army for a few days, to move
toward Atlanta by way of Dallas, southwest of the pass.Rations for a
twenty days' absence from direct railroad communication were issued to the
Federal army.In fact, Sherman's railroad connection with the North was
the one delicate problem of the whole movement.The Confederates had
destroyed the iron way as they moved southward; but the Federal engineers,
following the army, repaired the line and rebuilt the bridges almost as
fast as the army could march.Sherman's movement toward Dallas drew Johnston from the <DW72>s of the
Allatoona Hills.From Kingston, the Federal leader wrote on May 23d, "I am
already within fifty miles of Atlanta."But he was not to enter that city
for many weeks, not before he had measured swords again and again with his
great antagonist.On the 25th of May, the two great armies were facing
each other near New Hope Church, about four miles north of Dallas.Here,
for three or four days, there was almost incessant fighting, though there
was not what might be called a pitched battle.Late in the afternoon of the first day, Hooker made a vicious attack on
Stewart's division of Hood's corps.For two hours the battle raged without
a moment's cessation, Hooker being pressed back with heavy loss.During
those two hours he had held his ground against sixteen field-pieces and
five thousand infantry at close range.The name "Hell Hole" was applied to
this spot by the Union soldiers.On the next day there was considerable skirmishing in different places
along the line that divided the two armies.But the chief labor of the day
was throwing up entrenchments, preparatory to a general engagement.The
country, however, was ill fitted for such a contest.The continuous
succession of hills, covered with primeval forests, presented little
opportunity for two great armies, stretched out almost from Dallas to
Marietta, a distance of about ten miles, to come together simultaneously
at all points.A severe contest occurred on the 27th, near the center of the
battle-lines, between General O. O. Howard on the Federal side and General
Patrick Cleburne on the part of the South.Dense and almost impenetrable
was the undergrowth through which Howard led his troops to make the
attack.The fight was at close range and was fierce and bloody, the
Confederates gaining the greater advantage.The next day Johnston made a terrific attack on the Union right, under
McPherson, near Dallas.But McPherson was well entrenched and the
Confederates were repulsed with a serious loss.In the three or four days'
fighting the Federal loss was probably twenty-four hundred men and the
Confederate somewhat greater.In the early days of June, Sherman took possession of the town of
Allatoona and made it a second base of supplies, after repairing the
railroad bridge across the Etowah River.Johnston swung his left around to
Lost Mountain and his right extended beyond the railroad--a line ten miles
in length and much too long for its numbers.Johnston's army, however, had
been reenforced, and it now numbered about seventy-five thousand men.Sherman, on June 1st, had nearly one hundred and thirteen thousand men and
on the 8th he received the addition of a cavalry brigade and two divisions
of the Seventeenth Corps, under General Frank P. Blair, which had marched
from Alabama.So multifarious were the movements of the two great armies among the hills
and forests of that part of Georgia that it is impossible for us to follow
them all.On the 14th of June, Generals Johnston, Hardee, and Polk rode up
the <DW72> of Pine Mountain to reconnoiter.As they were standing, making
observations, a Federal battery in the distance opened on them and General
Polk was struck in the chest with a Parrot shell.General Polk was greatly beloved, and his death caused a shock to the
whole Confederate army.He was a graduate of West Point; but after being
graduated he took orders in the church and for twenty years before the war
was Episcopal Bishop of Louisiana.At the outbreak of the war he entered
the field and served with distinction to the moment of his death.During the next two weeks there was almost incessant fighting, heavy
skirmishing, sparring for position.It was a wonderful game of military
strategy, played among the hills and mountains and forests by two masters
in the art of war.On June 23d, Sherman wrote, "The whole country is one
vast fort, and Johnston must have full fifty miles of connected
trenches.... Our lines are now in close contact, and the fighting
incessant.... As fast as we gain one position, the enemy has another all
ready."Sherman, conscious of superior strength, was now anxious for a real
battle, a fight to the finish with his antagonist.But Johnston was too
wily to be thus caught.He made no false move on the great chessboard of
war.At length, the impatient Sherman decided to make a general front
attack, even though Johnston, at that moment, was impregnably entrenched
on the <DW72>s of Kenesaw Mountain.This was precisely what the Confederate
commander was hoping for.The desperate battle of Kenesaw Mountain occurred on the 27th of June.In
the early morning hours, the boom of Federal cannon announced the opening
of a bloody day's struggle.It was soon answered by the Confederate
batteries in the entrenchments along the mountain side, and the deafening
roar of the giant conflict reverberated from the surrounding hills.About
nine o'clock the Union infantry advance began.On the left was McPherson,
who sent the Fifteenth Army Corps, led by General John A. Logan, directly
against the mountain.The artillery from the Confederate trenches in front
of Logan cut down his men by hundreds.The Federals charged courageously
and captured the lower works, but failed to take the higher ridges.The chief assault of the day was by the Army of the Cumberland, under
Thomas.Most conspicuous in the attack were the divisions of Newton and
Davis, advancing against General Loring, successor of the lamented Polk.Far up on a ridge at one point, General Cleburne held a line of
breastworks, supported by the flanking fire of artillery.Against this a
vain and costly assault was made.When the word was given to charge, the Federals sprang forward and, in the
face of a deadly hail of musket-balls and shells, they dashed up the
<DW72>, firing as they went.Stunned and bleeding, they were checked again
and again by the withering fire from the mountain <DW72>; but they
re-formed and pressed on with dauntless valor.Some of them reached the
parapets and were instantly shot down, their bodies rolling into the
Confederate trenches among the men who had slain them, or back down the
hill whence they had come.General Harker, leading a charge against
Cleburne, was mortally wounded.His men were swept back by a galling fire,
though many fell with their brave leader.This assault on Kenesaw Mountain cost Sherman three thousand men and won
him nothing.The battle
continued but two and a half hours.It was one of the most recklessly
daring assaults during the whole war period, but did not greatly affect
the final result of the campaign.Under a flag of truce, on the day after the battle, the men of the North
and of the South met on the gory field to bury their dead and to minister
to the wounded.They met as friends for the moment, and not as foes.It
was said that there were instances of father and son, one in blue and the
other in gray, and brothers on opposite sides, meeting one another on the
bloody <DW72>s of Kenesaw.Tennessee and Kentucky had sent thousands of men
to each side in the fratricidal struggle and not infrequently families had
been divided.Three weeks of almost incessant rain fell upon the struggling armies
during this time, rendering their operations disagreeable and
unsatisfactory.The camp equipage, the men's uniforms and accouterments
were thoroughly saturated with rain and mud.Still the warriors of the
North and of the South lived and fought on the <DW72>s of the mountain
range, intent on destroying each other.Sherman was convinced by his drastic repulse at Kenesaw Mountain that
success lay not in attacking his great antagonist in a strong position,
and he resumed his old tactics.He would flank Johnston from Kenesaw as he
had flanked him out of Dalton and Allatoona Pass.He thereupon turned upon
Johnston's line of communication with Atlanta, whence the latter received
his supplies.The movement was successful, and in a few days Kenesaw
Mountain was deserted.Johnston moved to the banks of the Chattahoochee, Sherman following in
the hope of catching him while crossing the river.But the wary
Confederate had again, as at Resaca, prepared entrenchments in advance,
and these were on the north bank of the river.He hastened to them, then
turned on the approaching Federals and defiantly awaited attack.But
Sherman remembered Kenesaw and there was no battle.The feints, the sparring, the flanking movements among the hills and
forests continued day after day.The immediate aim in the early days of
July was to cross the Chattahoochee.On the 8th, Sherman sent Schofield
and McPherson across, ten miles or more above the Confederate position.Sherman's position was by no means reassuring.It is true he had, in the
space of two months, pressed his antagonist back inch by inch for more
than a hundred miles and was now almost within sight of the goal of the
campaign--the city of Atlanta.But the single line of railroad that
connected him with the North and brought supplies from Louisville, five
hundred miles away, for a hundred thousand men and twenty-three thousand
animals, might at any moment be destroyed by Confederate raiders.The necessity of guarding the Western and Atlantic Railroad was an
ever-present concern with Sherman.Forrest and his cavalry force were in
northern Mississippi waiting for him to get far enough on the way to
Atlanta for them to pounce upon the iron way and tear it to ruins.To
prevent this General Samuel D. Sturgis, with eight thousand troops, was
sent from Memphis against Forrest.He met him on the 10th of June near
Guntown, Mississippi, but was sadly beaten and driven back to Memphis, one
hundred miles away.The affair, nevertheless, delayed Forrest in his
operations against the railroad, and meanwhile General Smith's troops
returned to Memphis from the Red River expedition, somewhat late according
to the schedule but eager to join Sherman in the advance on Atlanta.Smith, however, was directed to take the offensive against Forrest, and
with fourteen thousand troops, and in a three days' fight, demoralized him
badly at Tupelo, Mississippi, July 14th-17th.Smith returned to Memphis
and made another start for Sherman, when he was suddenly turned back and
sent to Missouri, where the Confederate General Price was extremely
active, to help Rosecrans.To avoid final defeat and to win the ground he had gained had taxed
Sherman's powers to the last degree and was made possible only through his
superior numbers.Even this degree of success could not be expected to
continue if the railroad to the North should be destroyed.But Sherman
must do more than he had done; he must capture Atlanta, this Richmond of
the far South, with its cannon foundries and its great machine-shops, its
military factories, and extensive army supplies.He must divide the
Confederacy north and south as Grant's capture of Vicksburg had split it
east and west.Sherman must have Atlanta, for political reasons as well as for military
purposes.The country was in the midst of a presidential campaign.The
opposition to Lincoln's reelection was strong, and for many weeks it was
believed on all sides that his defeat was inevitable.At least, the
success of the Union arms in the field was deemed essential to Lincoln's
success at the polls.Grant had made little progress in Virginia and his
terrible repulse at Cold Harbor, in June, had cast a gloom over every
Northern State.Farragut was operating in Mobile Bay; but his success was
still in the future.The eyes of the supporters of the great war-president turned longingly,
expectantly, toward General Sherman and his hundred thousand men before
Atlanta."Do something--something spectacular--save the party and save the
country thereby from permanent disruption!"This was the cry of the
millions, and Sherman understood it.But withal, the capture of the
Georgia city may have been doubtful but for the fact that at the critical
moment the Confederate President made a decision that resulted,
unconsciously, in a decided service to the Union cause.He dismissed
General Johnston and put another in his place, one who was less strategic
and more impulsive.Jefferson Davis did not agree with General Johnston's military judgment,
and he seized on the fact that Johnston had so steadily retreated before
the Northern army as an excuse for his removal.On the 18th of July, Davis
turned the Confederate Army of Tennessee over to General John B. Hood.A
graduate of West Point of the class of 1853, a classmate of McPherson,
Schofield, and Sheridan, Hood had faithfully served the cause of the South
since the opening of the war.He was known as a fighter, and it was
believed that he would change the policy of Johnston to one of open battle
with Sherman's army.Johnston had lost, since the opening of the campaign at Dalton, about
fifteen thousand men, and the army that he now delivered to Hood consisted
of about sixty thousand in all.While Hood was no match for Sherman as a strategist, he was not a
weakling.His policy of aggression, however, was not suited to the
circumstances--to the nature of the country--in view of the fact that
Sherman's army was far stronger than his own.Two days after Hood took command of the Confederate army he offered
battle.Sherman's forces had crossed Peach Tree Creek, a small stream
flowing into the Chattahoochee, but a few miles from Atlanta, and were
approaching the city.They had thrown up slight breastworks, as was their
custom, but were not expecting an attack.Suddenly, however, about four
o'clock in the afternoon of July 20th, an imposing column of Confederates
burst from the woods near the position of the Union right center, under
Thomas.The battle was short,
fierce, and bloody.The Confederates made a gallant assault, but were
pressed back to their entrenchments, leaving the ground covered with dead
and wounded.The Federal loss in the battle of Peach Tree Creek was
placed at over seventeen hundred, the Confederate loss being much greater.This battle had been planned by Johnston before his removal, but he had
been waiting for the strategic moment to fight it.Two days later, July 22d, occurred the greatest engagement of the entire
campaign--the battle of Atlanta.The Federal army was closing in on the
entrenchments of Atlanta, and was now within two or three miles of the
city.On the night of the 21st, General Blair, of McPherson's army, had
gained possession of a high hill on the left, which commanded a view of
the heart of the city.Hood thereupon planned to recapture this hill, and
make a general attack on the morning of the 22d.He sent General Hardee on
a long night march around the extreme flank of McPherson's army, the
attack to be made at daybreak.Meantime, General Cheatham, who had
succeeded to the command of Hood's former corps, and General A. P.
Stewart, who now had Polk's corps, were to engage Thomas and Schofield in
front and thus prevent them from sending aid to McPherson.Hardee was delayed in his fifteen-mile night march, and it was noon before
he attacked.At about that hour Generals Sherman and McPherson sat talking
near the Howard house, which was the Federal headquarters, when the sudden
boom of artillery from beyond the hill that Blair had captured announced
the opening of the coming battle.McPherson quickly leaped upon his horse
and galloped away toward the sound of the guns.Meeting Logan and Blair
near the railroad, he conferred with them for a moment, when they
separated, and each hastened to his place in the battle-line.McPherson
sent aides and orderlies in various directions with despatches, until but
two were still with him.He then rode into a forest and was suddenly
confronted by a portion of the Confederate army under General Cheatham."Surrender," was the call that rang out.But he wheeled his horse as if to
flee, when he was instantly shot dead, and the horse galloped back
riderless.The death of the brilliant, dashing young leader, James B. McPherson, was
a great blow to the Union army.But thirty-six years of age, one of the
most promising men in the country, and already the commander of a military
department, McPherson was the only man in all the Western armies whom
Grant, on going to the East, placed in the same military class with
Sherman.Logan succeeded the fallen commander, and the battle raged on.The
Confederates were gaining headway.Cheatham
was pressing on, pouring volley after volley into the ranks of the Army of
the Tennessee, which seemed about to be cut in twain.General Sherman was present and saw
the danger.Calling for Schofield to send several batteries, he placed
them and poured a concentrated artillery fire through the gap and mowed
down the advancing men in swaths.At the same time, Logan pressed forward
and Schofield's infantry was called up.The Confederates were hurled back
with great loss.The shadows of night fell--and the battle of Atlanta was
over.Hood's losses exceeded eight thousand of his brave men, whom he
could ill spare.The Confederate army recuperated within the defenses of Atlanta--behind an
almost impregnable barricade.Sherman had no hope of carrying the city by
assault, while to surround and invest it was impossible with his numbers.He determined, therefore, to strike Hood's lines of supplies.On July
28th, Hood again sent Hardee out from his entrenchments to attack the Army
of the Tennessee, now under the command of General Howard.A fierce battle
at Ezra Church on the west side of the city ensued, and again the
Confederates were defeated with heavy loss.A month passed and Sherman had made little progress toward capturing
Atlanta.Two cavalry raids which he organized resulted in defeat, but the
two railroads from the south into Atlanta were considerably damaged.But,
late in August, the Northern commander made a daring move that proved
successful.Leaving his base of supplies, as Grant had done before
Vicksburg, and marching toward Jonesboro, Sherman destroyed the Macon and
Western Railroad, the only remaining line of supplies to the Confederate
army.Hood attempted to block the march on Jonesboro, and Hardee was sent with
his and S. D. Lee's Corps to attack the Federals, while he himself sought
an opportunity to move upon Sherman's right flank.Hardee's attack failed,
and this necessitated the evacuation of Atlanta.After blowing up his
magazines and destroying the supplies which his men could not carry with
them, Hood abandoned the city, and the next day, September 2d, General
Slocum, having succeeded Hooker, led the Twentieth Corps of the Federal
army within its earthen walls.Hood had made his escape, saving his army
from capture.His chief desire would have been to march directly north on
Marietta and destroy the depots of Federal supplies, but a matter of more
importance prevented.Thirty-four thousand Union prisoners were confined
at Andersonville, and a small body of cavalry could have released them.So
Hood placed himself between Andersonville and Sherman.In the early days of September the Federal hosts occupied the city toward
which they had toiled all the summer long.At East Point, Atlanta, and
Decatur, the three armies settled for a brief rest, while the cavalry,
stretched for many miles along the Chattahoochee, protected their flanks
and rear.Since May their ranks had been depleted by some twenty-eight
thousand killed and wounded, while nearly four thousand had fallen
prisoners, into the Confederates' hands.It was a great price, but whatever else the capture of Atlanta did, it
ensured the reelection of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency of the United
States.The total Confederate losses were in the neighborhood of
thirty-five thousand, of which thirteen thousand were prisoners.[Illustration: SHERMAN IN 1865

fighting was over.To Joseph E. Johnston he offered most liberal terms of
surrender for the Southern armies.Their acceptance would have gone far to
prevent the worst of the reconstruction enormities.Unfortunately his
first convention with Johnston was disapproved.The death of Lincoln had
removed the guiding hand that would have meant so much to the nation.To
those who have read his published correspondence and his memoirs Sherman
appears in a very human light.He was fluent and frequently reckless in
speech and writing, but his kindly humanity is seen in both.[Illustration: BUZZARD'S ROOST, GEORGIA, MAY 7, 1864]

In the upper picture rises the precipitous height of Rocky Face as Sherman
saw it on May 7, 1864.His troops under Thomas had moved forward along the
line of the railroad, opening the great Atlanta campaign on schedule time.Looking down into the gorge called Buzzard's Roost, through which the
railroad passes, Sherman could see swarms of Confederate troops, the road
filled with obstructions, and hostile batteries crowning the cliffs on
either side.He knew that his antagonist, Joe Johnston, here confronted
him in force.But it was to be a campaign of brilliant flanking movements,
and Sherman sat quietly down to wait till the trusty McPherson should
execute the first one.In the lower picture, drawn up on dress parade, stands one of the finest
fighting organizations in the Atlanta campaign.This regiment won its
spurs in the first Union victory in the West at Mill Springs, Kentucky,
January 19, 1862.There, according to the muster-out roll, "William Blake,
musician, threw away his drum and took a gun."The spirit of this drummer
boy of Company F was the spirit of all the troops from Minnesota.A
Georgian noticed an unusually fine body of men marching by, and when told
that they were a Minnesota regiment, said, "I didn't know they had any
troops up there."But the world was to learn the superlative fighting
qualities of the men from the Northwest.Sherman was glad to have all he
could get of them in this great army of one hundred thousand veterans.[Illustration: THE SECOND MINNESOTA INFANTRY--ENGAGED AT ROCKY FACE RIDGE,

General Richard W. Johnson, ready to advance with his cavalry division in
the vanguard of the direct movement upon the Confederates strongly posted

yet fully equipped and joined the army after the campaign had opened.General Richard W. Johnson's division of Thomas' command, with General
Palmer's division, was given the honor of heading the line of march when
the Federals got in motion on May 5th.The same troops (Palmer's division)
had made the same march in February, sent by Grant to engage Johnston at
Dalton during Sherman's Meridian campaign.Johnson was a West Pointer; he
had gained his cavalry training in the Mexican War, and had fought the
Indians on the Texas border.He distinguished himself at Corinth, and
rapidly rose to the command of a division in Buell's army.Fresh from a
Confederate prison, he joined the Army of the Cumberland in the summer of
1862 to win new laurels at Stone's River, Chickamauga, and Missionary
Ridge.His sabers were conspicuously active in the Atlanta campaign; and
at the battle of New Hope Church on May 28th Johnson himself was wounded,
but recovered in time to join Schofield after the fall of Atlanta and to
assist him in driving Hood and Forrest out of Tennessee.For his bravery
at the battle of Nashville he was brevetted brigadier-general, U. S. A.,
December 16, 1864, and after the war he was retired with the brevet of
major-general.[Illustration: RESACA--FIELD OF THE FIRST HEAVY FIGHTING

had caused to be thrown up by the <DW64> laborers all along his line of
possible retreat.McPherson, sent by Sherman to strike the railroad in
Johnston's rear, got his head of column through Snake Creek Gap on May
9th, and drove off a Confederate cavalry brigade which retreated toward
Dalton, bringing to Johnston the first news that a heavy force of Federals
was already in his rear.McPherson, within a mile and a half of Resaca,
could have walked into the town with his twenty-three thousand men, but
concluded that the Confederate entrenchments were too strongly held to
assault.When Sherman arrived he found that Johnston, having the shorter
route, was there ahead of him with his entire army strongly posted.On May
15th, "without attempting to assault the fortified works," says Sherman,
"we pressed at all points, and the sound of cannon and musketry rose all
day to the dignity of a battle."Its havoc is seen in the shattered trees
and torn ground in the lower picture.[Illustration: THE WORK OF THE FIRING AT RESACA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The strong works in the pictures, commanding the railroad bridge over the
Etowah River, were the fourth fortified position to be abandoned by
Johnston within a month.Pursued by Thomas from Resaca, he had made a
brief stand at Kingston and then fallen back steadily and in superb order
into Cassville.There he issued an address to his army announcing his
purpose to retreat no more but to accept battle.His troops were all drawn
up in preparation for a struggle, but that night at supper with Generals
Hood and Polk he was convinced by them that the ground occupied by their
troops was untenable, being enfiladed by the Federal artillery.Johnston,
therefore, gave up his purpose of battle, and on the night of May 20th put
the Etowah River between himself and Sherman and retreated to Allatoona
Pass, shown in the lower picture.[Illustration: ALLATOONA PASS IN THE DISTANCE]

In taking this the camera was planted inside the breastworks seen on the
eminence in the upper picture.Sherman's army now rested after its rapid
advance and waited a few days for the railroad to be repaired in their
rear so that supplies could be brought up.Meanwhile Johnston was being
severely criticized at the South for his continual falling back without
risking a battle.His friends stoutly maintained that it was all
strategic, while some of the Southern newspapers quoted the Federal
General Scott's remark, "Beware of Lee advancing, and watch Johnston at a
stand; for the devil himself would be defeated in the attempt to whip him
retreating."But General Jeff C. Davis, sent by Sherman, took Rome on May
17th and destroyed valuable mills and foundries.Thus began the
accomplishment of one of the main objects of Sherman's march.[Illustration: PINE MOUNTAIN, WHERE POLK, THE FIGHTING BISHOP OF THE
CONFEDERACY, WAS KILLED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The blasted pine rears its gaunt height above the mountain <DW72>, covered
with trees slashed down to hold the Federals at bay; and here, on June 14,
1864, the Confederacy lost a commander, a bishop, and a hero.Lieut.-General Leonidas Polk, commanding one of Johnston's army corps,
with Johnston himself and Hardee, another corps commander, was studying
Sherman's position at a tense moment of the latter's advance around Pine
Mountain.The three Confederates stood upon the rolling height, where the
center of Johnston's army awaited the Federal attack.They could see the
columns in blue pushing east of them; the smoke and rattle of musketry as
the pickets were driven in; and the bustle with which the Federal advance
guard felled trees and constructed trenches at their very feet.On the
lonely height the three figures stood conspicuous.A Federal order was
given the artillery to open upon any men in gray who looked like officers
reconnoitering the new position.So, while Hardee was pointing to his
comrade and his chief the danger of one of his divisions which the Federal
advance was cutting off, the bishop-general was struck in the chest by a
cannon shot.Thus the Confederacy lost a leader of unusual influence.Although a bishop of the Episcopal Church, Polk was educated at West
Point.When he threw in his lot with the Confederacy, thousands of his
fellow-Louisianians followed him.A few days before the battle of Pine
Mountain, as he and General Hood were riding together, the bishop was told
by his companion that he had never been received into the communion of a
church and was begged that the rite might be performed.At Hood's headquarters, by the light of a tallow
candle, with a tin basin on the mess table for a baptismal font, and with
Hood's staff present as witnesses, all was ready.Hood, "with a face like
that of an old crusader," stood before the bishop.Crippled by wounds at
Gaines' Mill, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga, he could not kneel, but bent
forward on his crutches.The bishop, in full uniform of the Confederate
army, administered the rite.A few days later, by a strange coincidence,
he was approached by General Johnston on the same errand, and the man whom
Hood was soon to succeed was baptized in the same simple manner.Polk, as
Bishop, had administered his last baptism, and as soldier had fought his
last battle; for Pine Mountain was near.[Illustration: LIEUT.-GEN.LEONIDAS POLK, C. S.[Illustration: IN THE HARDEST FIGHT OF THE CAMPAIGN--THE

speaks of the peculiarly depressing effect that the weather had upon his
troops in the wooded country.Nevertheless he must either assault
Johnston's strong position on the mountain or begin again his flanking
tactics.He decided upon the former, and on June 27th, after three days'
preparation, the assault was made.At nine in the morning along the
Federal lines the furious fire of musketry and artillery was begun, but at
all points the Confederates met it with determined courage and in great
force.McPherson's attacking column, under General Blair, fought its way
up the face of little Kenesaw but could not reach the summit.Then the
courageous troops of Thomas charged up the face of the mountain and
planted their colors on the very parapet of the Confederate works.Here
General Harker, commanding the brigade in which fought the 125th Ohio,
fell mortally wounded, as did Brigadier-General Daniel McCook, and also
General Wagner.[Illustration: FEDERAL ENTRENCHMENTS AT THE FOOT OF KENESAW MOUNTAIN

already fought as one of the eight batteries at Fort Henry and Fort
Donelson, heard the roar of the battle of Shiloh, and participated in the
sieges of Corinth and Vicksburg.The artillery in the West was not a whit
less necessary to the armies than that in the East.Pope's brilliant feat
of arms in the capture of Island No.10 added to the growing respect in
which the artillery was held by the other arms of the service.The
effective fire of the massed batteries at Murfreesboro turned the tide of
battle.At Chickamauga the Union artillery inflicted fearful losses upon
the Confederates.At Atlanta again they counted their dead by the
hundreds, and at Franklin and Nashville the guns maintained the best
traditions of the Western armies.They played no small part in winning
battles.[Illustration: THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS NEAR MARIETTA DURING THE FIGHTING OF

lines of _chevaux-de-frise_.Atlanta was engaged in the final grapple with
the force that was to overcome her.Sherman has fought his way past
Kenesaw and across the Chattahoochee, through a country which he describes
as "one vast fort," saying that "Johnston must have at least fifty miles
of connected trenches with abatis and finished batteries."Anticipating
that Sherman might drive him back upon Atlanta, Johnston had constructed,
during the winter, heavily fortified positions all the way from Dalton.During his two months in retreat the fortifications at Atlanta had been
strengthened to the utmost.What he might have done behind them was never
to be known.[Illustration: THE CHATTAHOOCHEE BRIDGE]

"One of the strongest pieces of field fortification I ever saw"--this was
Sherman's characterization of the entrenchments that guarded the railroad
bridge over the Chattahoochee on July 5th.A glimpse of the bridge and the
freshly-turned earth in 1864 is given by the upper picture.At this river
Johnston made his final effort to hold back Sherman from a direct attack
upon Atlanta.If Sherman could get successfully across that river, the
Confederates would be compelled to fall back behind the defenses of the
city, which was the objective of the campaign.Sherman perceived at once
the futility of trying to carry by assault this strongly garrisoned
position.Instead, he made a feint at crossing the river lower down, and
simultaneously went to work in earnest eight miles north of the bridge.The lower picture shows the canvas pontoon boats as perfected by Union
engineers in 1864.A number of these were stealthily set up and launched
by Sherman's Twenty-third Corps near the mouth of Soap Creek, behind a
ridge.Byrd's brigade took the defenders of the southern bank completely
by surprise.It was short work for the Federals to throw pontoon bridges
across and to occupy the coveted spot in force.[Illustration: INFANTRY AND ARTILLERY CROSSING ON BOATS MADE OF PONTOONS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Johnston's parrying of Sherman's mighty strokes was "a model of defensive
warfare," declares one of Sherman's own division commanders, Jacob D. Cox.There was not a man in the Federal army from Sherman down that did not
rejoice to hear that Johnston had been superseded by Hood on July 18th.Johnston, whose mother was a niece of Patrick Henry, was fifty-seven years
old, cold in manner, measured and accurate in speech.His dark firm face,
surmounted by a splendidly intellectual forehead, betokened the
experienced and cautious soldier.His dismissal was one of the political
mistakes which too often hampered capable leaders on both sides.His
Fabian policy in Georgia was precisely the same as that which was winning
fame against heavy odds for Lee in Virginia.[Illustration: GENERAL JOSEPH EGGLESTON JOHNSTON, C. S. A.

The countenance of Hood, on the other hand, indicates an eager, restless
energy, an impetuosity that lacked the poise of Sherman, whose every
gesture showed the alertness of mind and soundness of judgment that in him
were so exactly balanced.Both Schofield and McPherson were classmates of
Hood at West Point, and characterized him to Sherman as "bold even to
rashness and courageous in the extreme."He struck the first offensive
blow at Sherman advancing on Atlanta, and wisely adhered to the plan of
the battle as it had been worked out by Johnston just before his removal.But the policy of attacking was certain to be finally disastrous to the
Confederates.[Illustration: PEACH-TREE CREEK, WHERE HOOD HIT HARD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Counting these closely clustered Federal graves gives one an idea of the
overwhelming onset with Hood become the aggressor on July 20th.Beyond the
graves are some of the trenches from which the Federals were at first
irresistibly driven.In the background flows Peach-Tree Creek, the little
stream that gives its name to the battlefield.Hood, impatient to
signalize his new responsibility by a stroke that would at once dispel the
gloom at Richmond, had posted his troops behind strongly fortified works
on a ridge commanding the valley of Peach-Tree Creek about five miles to
the north of Atlanta.As the
Federals were disposing their lines and entrenching before this position,
Hood's eager eyes detected a gap in their formation and at four o'clock in
the afternoon hurled a heavy force against it.Thus he proved his
reputation for courage, but the outcome showed the mistake.For a brief
interval Sherman's forces were in great peril.But the Federals under
Newton and Geary rallied and held their ground, till Ward's division in a
brave counter-charge drove the Confederates back.He abandoned his entrenchments that night, leaving on the field
five hundred dead, one thousand wounded, and many prisoners.Sherman
estimated the total Confederate loss at no less than five thousand.That
of the Federals was fifteen hundred.[Illustration: THE ARMY'S FINGER-TIPS--PICKETS BEFORE ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.A Federal picket post on the lines before Atlanta.This picture was taken
shortly before the battle of July 22d.The soldiers are idling about
unconcerned at exposing themselves; this is on the "reserve post."Somewhat in advance of this lay the outer line of pickets, and it would be
time enough to seek cover if they were driven in.Thus armies feel for
each other, stretching out first their sensitive fingers--the pickets.If
these recoil, the skirmishers are sent forward while the strong arm, the
line of battle, gathers itself to meet the foe.As this was an inner line,
it was more strongly fortified than was customary with the pickets.But
the men of both sides had become very expert in improvising field-works at
this stage of the war.Hard campaigning had taught the veterans the
importance to themselves of providing such protection, and no orders had
to be given for their construction.As soon as a regiment gained a
position desirable to hold, the soldiers would throw up a strong parapet
of dirt and logs in a single night.In order to spare the men as much as
possible, Sherman ordered his division commanders to organize pioneer
detachments out of the <DW64>s that escaped to the Federals.[Illustration: THE FINAL BLOW TO THE CONFEDERACY'S SOUTHERN STRONGHOLD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.It was Sherman's experienced railroad wreckers that finally drove Hood out
of Atlanta.In the picture the rails heating red-hot amid the flaming
bonfires of the ties, and the piles of twisted debris show vividly what
Sherman meant when he said their "work was done with a will."Sherman saw
that in order to take Atlanta without terrific loss he must cut off all
its rail communications.This he did by "taking the field with our main
force and using it against the communications of Atlanta instead of
against its intrenchments."On the night of August 25th he moved with
practically his entire army and wagon-trains loaded with fifteen days'
rations.By the morning of the 27th the whole front of the city was
deserted.The Confederates concluded that Sherman was in retreat.Next day
they found out their mistake, for the Federal army lay across the West
Point Railroad while the soldiers began wrecking it.Next day they were in
motion toward the railroad to Macon, and General Hood began to understand
that a colossal raid was in progress.After the occupation, when this
picture was taken, Sherman's men completed the work of destruction.[Illustration: THE RUIN OF HOOD'S RETREAT--DEMOLISHED CARS AND

could not sleep.That day he had defeated the force sent against him at
Jonesboro and cut them off from returning to Atlanta.This was Hood's last
effort to save his communications.About midnight sounds of exploding
shells and what seemed like volleys of musketry arose in the direction of
Atlanta.Supplies and ammunition
that Hood could carry with him were being removed; large quantities of
provisions were being distributed among the citizens, and as the troops
marched out they were allowed to take what they could from the public
stores.The noise that Sherman heard that
night was the blowing up of the rolling-mill and of about a hundred cars
and six engines loaded with Hood's abandoned ammunition.The picture shows

[Illustration]

BLAIR, OF MISSOURI

Although remaining politically neutral throughout the war, Missouri
contributed four hundred and forty-seven separate military organizations
to the Federal armies, and over one hundred to the Confederacy.The Union
sentiment in the State is said to have been due to Frank P. Blair, who,
early in 1861, began organizing home guards.Blair subsequently joined
Grant's command and served with that leader until Sherman took the helm in
the West.With Sherman Major-General Blair fought in Georgia and through
the Carolinas.[Illustration]

BAKER, OF CALIFORNIA

California contributed twelve military organizations to the Federal
forces, but none of them took part in the campaigns east of the
Mississippi.Its Senator, Edward D. Baker, was in his place in Washington
when the war broke out, and, being a close friend of Lincoln, promptly
organized a regiment of Pennsylvanians which was best known by its synonym
"First California."Colonel Baker was killed at the head of it at the
battle of Ball's Bluff, Virginia, October 21, 1861.Baker had been
appointed brigadier-general but declined.[Illustration]

KELLEY, OF WEST VIRGINIA

West Virginia counties had already supplied soldiers for the Confederates
when the new State was organized in 1861.As early as May, 1861, Colonel
B. F. Kelley was in the field with the First West Virginia Infantry
marshalled under the Stars and Stripes.He served to the end of the war
and was brevetted major-general.West Virginia furnished thirty-seven
organizations of all arms to the Federal armies, chiefly for local defense
and for service in contiguous territory.General Kelley was prominent in
the Shenandoah campaigns.[Illustration]

SMYTH, OF DELAWARE

Little Delaware furnished to the Federal armies fifteen separate military
organizations.First in the field was Colonel Thomas A. Smyth, with the
First Delaware Infantry.Early promoted to the command of a brigade, he
led it at Gettysburg, where it received the full force of Pickett's charge
on Cemetery Ridge, July 3, 1863.He was brevetted major-general and fell
at Farmville, on Appomattox River, Va., April 7, 1865, two days before the
surrender at Appomattox.General Smyth was a noted leader in the Second
Corps.[Illustration]

MITCHELL, OF KANSAS

The virgin State of Kansas sent fifty regiments, battalions, and batteries
into the Federal camps.Its Second Infantry was organized and led to the
field by Colonel R. B. Mitchell, a veteran of the Mexican War.At the
first battle in the West, Wilson's Creek, Mo.(August 10, 1861), he was
wounded.At the battle of Perryville, Brigadier-General Mitchell commanded
a division in McCook's Corps and fought desperately to hold the Federal
left flank against a sudden and desperate assault by General Bragg's
Confederates.[Illustration]

CROSS, OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

New Hampshire supplied twenty-nine military organizations to the Federal
armies.To the Granite State belongs the grim distinction of furnishing
the regiment which had the heaviest mortality roll of any infantry
organization in the army.This was the Fifth New Hampshire, commanded by
Colonel E. E. Cross.The Fifth served in the Army of the Potomac.At
Gettysburg, Colonel Cross commanded a brigade, which included the Fifth
New Hampshire, and was killed at the head of it near Devil's Den, on July
2, 1863.LEADERS IN SECURING VOLUNTEERS FOR NORTH AND SOUTH

PEARCE, OF ARKANSAS

Arkansas entered into the war with enthusiasm, and had a large contingent
of Confederate troops ready for the field in the summer of 1861.At
Wilson's Creek, Missouri, August 10, 1861, there were four regiments and
two batteries of Arkansans under command of Brigadier-General N. B.
Pearce.Arkansas furnished seventy separate military organizations to the
Confederate armies and seventeen to the Federals.The State was gallantly
represented in the Army of Northern Virginia, notably at Antietam and
Gettysburg.[Illustration]

STEUART, OF MARYLAND

Maryland quickly responded to the Southern call to arms, and among its
first contribution of soldiers was George H. Steuart, who led a battalion
across the Potomac early in 1861.These Marylanders fought at First Bull
Run, or Manassas, and Lee's army at Petersburg included Maryland troops
under Brigadier-General Steuart.During the war this little border State,
politically neutral, sent six separate organizations to the Confederates
in Virginia, and mustered thirty-five for the Federal camps and for local
defense.[Illustration]

CRITTENDEN, THE CONFEDERATE

Kentucky is notable as a State which sent brothers to both the Federal and
Confederate armies.Major-General George B. Crittenden, C. S. A., was the
brother of Major-General Thomas L. Crittenden, U. S. A. Although remaining
politically neutral throughout the war, the Blue Grass State sent
forty-nine regiments, battalions, and batteries across the border to
uphold the Stars and Bars, and mustered eighty of all arms to battle
around the Stars and Stripes and protect the State from Confederate
incursions.[Illustration]

RANSOM, OF NORTH CAROLINA

The last of the Southern States to cast its fortunes in with the
Confederacy, North Carolina vied with the pioneers in the spirit with
which it entered the war.With the First North Carolina, Lieut.-Col.Matt
W. Ransom was on the firing-line early in 1861.Under his leadership as
brigadier-general, North Carolinians carried the Stars and Bars on all the
great battlefields of the Army of Northern Virginia.The State furnished
ninety organizations for the Confederate armies, and sent eight to the
Federal camps.[Illustration]

FINEGAN, OF FLORIDA

Florida was one of the first to follow South Carolina's example in
dissolving the Federal compact.It furnished twenty-one military
organizations to the Confederate forces, and throughout the war maintained
a vigorous home defense.Its foremost soldier to take the field when the
State was menaced by a strong Federal expedition in February, 1864, was
Brigadier-General Joseph Finegan.Hastily gathering scattered detachments,
he defeated and checked the expedition at the battle of Olustee, or Ocean
Pond, on February 20.[Illustration]

CLEBURNE, OF TENNESSEE

Cleburne was of foreign birth, but before the war was one year old he
became the leader of Tennesseeans, fighting heroically on Tennessee soil.At Shiloh, Cleburne's brigade, and at Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and
Franklin, Major-General P. R. Cleburne's division found the post of honor.At Franklin this gallant Irishman "The 'Stonewall' Jackson of the West,"
led Tennesseeans for the last time and fell close to the breastworks.Tennessee sent the Confederate armies 129 organizations, and the Federal
fifty-six.[Illustration: THE LAST OF THE FRIGATE._Painted by E. Packbauer._

THE LAST CONFLICTS IN THE SHENANDOAH

    Sheridan's operations were characterized not so much, as has been
    supposed, by any originality of method, as by a just appreciation of
    the proper manner of combining the two arms of infantry and cavalry.He constantly used his powerful body of horse, which under his
    disciplined hand attained a high degree of perfection, as an
    impenetrable mask behind which he screened the execution of maneuvers
    of infantry columns hurled with a mighty momentum on one of the
    enemy's flanks.--_William Swinton, in "Campaigns of the Army of the
    Potomac."_


On July 12, 1864, in the streets of Washington, there could be distinctly
heard the boom of cannon and the sharp firing of musketry.The old specter "threaten Washington," that for
three years had been a standing menace to the Federal authorities and a
"very present help" to the Confederates, now seemed to have come in the
flesh.The hopes of the South and the fears of the North were apparently
about to be realized.The occasion of this demonstration before the very gates of the city was
the result of General Lee's project to relieve the pressure on his own
army, by an invasion of the border States and a threatening attitude
toward the Union capital.The plan had worked well before, and Lee
believed it again would be effective.Grant was pushing him hard in front
of Petersburg.Accordingly, Lee despatched the daring soldier, General
Jubal A. Early, to carry the war again to the northward.He was to go by
the beautiful and fertile Shenandoah valley, that highway of the
Confederates along which the legions of the South had marched and
countermarched.On the 9th of July, the advance lines of the Confederate
force came to the banks of the Monocacy, where they found General Lew
Wallace posted, with eight thousand men, half of Early's numbers, on the
eastern side of that stream, to contest the approach of the Southern
troops.The battle was brief but bloody; the Confederates, crossing the stream and
climbing its slippery banks, hurled their lines of gray against the
compact ranks of blue.The attack was impetuous; the repulse was stubborn.A wail of musketry rent the air and the Northern soldiers fell back to
their second position.Between the opposing forces was a narrow ravine
through which flowed a small brook.Across this stream the tide of battle
rose and fell.Its limpid current was soon crimsoned by the blood of the
dead and wounded.Wallace's columns, as did those of Early, bled, but they
stood.The result of the battle for a time hung in the balance.The retreat began, some of the troops in
order but the greater portion in confusion, and the victorious
Confederates found again an open way to Washington.Now within half a dozen miles of the city, with the dome of the Capitol in
full view, the Southern general pushed his lines so close to Fort Stevens
that he was ready to train his forty pieces of artillery upon its walls.General Augur, in command of the capital's defenses, hastily collected
what strength in men and guns he could.Heavy artillery, militia, sailors
from the navy yard, convalescents, Government employees of all kinds were
rushed to the forts around the city.General Wright, with two divisions of
the Sixth Corps, arrived from the camp at Petersburg, and Emory's division
of the Nineteenth Corps came just in time from New Orleans.This was on
July 11th, the very day on which Early appeared in front of Fort Stevens.The Confederate had determined to make an assault, but the knowledge of
the arrival of Wright and Emory caused him to change his mind.He realized
that, if unsuccessful, his whole force would be lost, and he concluded to
return.Nevertheless, he spent the 12th of July in threatening the city.In the middle of the afternoon General Wright sent out General Wheaton
with Bidwell's brigade of Getty's division, and Early's pickets and
skirmishers were driven back a mile.Pond in "The
Shenandoah Valley" thus describes the scene: "On the parapet of Fort
Stevens stood the tall form of Abraham Lincoln by the side of General
Wright, who in vain warned the eager President that his position was swept
by the bullets of sharpshooters, until an officer was shot down within
three feet of him, when he reluctantly stepped below.Sheltered from the
line of fire, Cabinet officers and a group of citizens and ladies,
breathless with excitement, watched the fortunes of the flight."Under cover of night the Confederates began to retrace their steps and
made their way to the Shenandoah, with General Wright in pursuit.As the
Confederate army was crossing that stream, at Snicker's Ferry, on the
18th, the pursuing Federals came upon them.Early turned, repulsed them,
and continued on his way to Winchester, where General Averell, from
Hunter's forces, now at Harper's Ferry, attacked them with his cavalry and
took several hundred prisoners.The Federal authorities were looking for a "man of the hour"--one whom
they might pit against the able and strategic Early.Such a one was found
in General Philip Henry Sheridan, whom some have called the "Marshal Ney
of America."He was selected by General Grant, and his instructions were
to drive the Confederates out of the Valley once for all.The middle of September found the Confederate forces centered about
Winchester, and the Union army was ten miles distant, with the Opequon
between them.At two o'clock on the morning of September 19th, the Union
camp was in motion, preparing for marching orders.At three o'clock the
forward movement was begun, and by daylight the Federal advance had driven
in the Confederate pickets.Emptying into the Opequon from the west are
two converging streams, forming a triangle with the Winchester and
Martinsburg pike as a base.The town of Winchester is situated on this road, and was therefore at the
bottom of the triangle.Before the town, the Confederate army stretched
its lines between the two streams.The Union army would have to advance
from the apex of the triangle, through a narrow ravine, shut in by thickly
wooded hills and gradually emerging into an undulating valley.At the end
of the gorge was a Confederate outwork, guarding the approach to
Winchester.Both generals had the same plan of battle in mind.Sheridan
would strike the Confederate center and right.Early was willing he should
do this, for he planned to strike the Union right, double it back, get
between Sheridan's army and the gorge, and thus cut off its retreat.It took time for the Union troops to pass through the ravine, and it was
late in the forenoon before the line of battle was formed.The attack and
defense were alike obstinate.Upon the Sixth Corps and Grover's division
of the Nineteenth Corps fell the brunt of the battle, since they were to
hold the center while the Army of West Virginia, under General Crook,
would sweep around them and turn the position of the opposing forces.The
Confederate General Ramseur, with his troops, drove back the Federal
center, held his ground for two hours, while the opposing lines were swept
by musketry and artillery from the front, and enfiladed by artillery.By this time, Russell's division of the Sixth Corps emerged from the
ravine.Forming in two lines, it marched quickly to the front.About the
same time the Confederates were also being reenforced.General Rodes
plunged into the fight, making a gallant attack and losing his life.General Gordon, with his columns of gray, swept across the summit of the
hills and through the murky clouds of smoke saw the steady advance of the
lines of blue.One of Russell's brigades struck the Confederate flank, and
the Federal line was reestablished.As the division moved forward to do
this General Russell fell, pierced through the heart by a piece of shell.The Fifth Maine battery, galloping into the field, unlimbered and with an
enfilading storm of canister aided in turning the tide.Piece by piece the
shattered Union line was picked up and reunited.Early sent the last of
his reserves into the conflict to turn the Union right.Now ensued the
fiercest fighting of the day.Regiment after regiment advanced to the wood
only to be hurled back again.Here it was that the One hundred and
fourteenth New York left its dreadful toll of men.Its position after the
battle could be told by the long, straight line of one hundred and
eighty-five of its dead and wounded.It was three o'clock in the afternoon; the hour of Early's repulse had
struck.To the right of the Union lines could be heard a mighty yell.The
Confederates seemed to redouble their fire.The shivering lightning bolts
shot through the air and the volleys of musketry increased in intensity.Then, across the shell-plowed field, came the reserves under General
Crook.Breasting the Confederate torrent of lead, which cut down nine
hundred of the reserves while crossing the open space, they rushed toward
the embattled lines of the South.At the same moment, coming out of the woods in the rear of the Federals,
were seen the men of the Nineteenth Corps under General Emory, who had for
three hours been lying in the grass awaiting their opportunity.The
Confederate bullets had been falling thick in their midst with fatal
certainty.Rushing into the contest like
madmen, they stopped at nothing.From two sides of the wood the men of
Emory and Crook charged simultaneously.The Union line overlapped the
Confederate at every point and doubled around the unprotected flanks.The
day for the Southerners was irretrievably lost.They fell back toward
Winchester in confusion.As they did so, a great uproar was heard on the
pike road.It was the Federal cavalry under General Torbert sweeping up
the road, driving the Confederate troopers before them.The surprised mass
was pressed into its own lines.The infantry was charged and many
prisoners and battle-flags captured.The sun was now sinking upon the horizon, and on the ascending <DW72>s in
the direction of the town could be seen the long, dark lines of men
following at the heels of the routed army.Along the crest of the
embattled summit galloped a force of cavalrymen, which, falling upon the
disorganized regiments of Early, aided, in the language of Sheridan, "to
send them whirling through Winchester."The Union pursuit continued until
the twilight had come and the shadows of night screened the scattered
forces of Early from the pursuing cavalrymen.The battle of Winchester, or
the Opequon, had been a bloody one--a loss of five thousand on the Federal
side, and about four thousand on the Confederate.By daylight of the following morning the victorious army was again in
pursuit.On the afternoon of that day, it caught up with the Confederates,
who now turned at bay at Fisher's Hill to resist the further approach of
their pursuers.The position selected by General Early was a strong one,
and his antagonist at once recognized it as such.The valley of the
Shenandoah at this point is about four miles wide, lying between Fisher's
Hill and Little North Mountain.General Early's line extended across the
entire valley, and he had greatly increased his already naturally strong
position.From the summit of Three Top
Mountain, his signal corps informed him of every movement of the Union
army in the valley below.General Sheridan's actions indicated a purpose
to assault the center of the Confederate line.For two days he continued
massing his regiments in that direction, at times even skirmishing for
position.General Wright pushed his men to within seven hundred yards of
the Southern battle-line.While this was going on in full view of the
Confederate general and his army, another movement was being executed
which even the vigilant signal officers on Three Top Mountain had not
observed.On the night of September 20th, the troops of General Crook were moved
into the timber on the north bank of Cedar Creek.All during the next day,
they lay concealed.That night they crossed the stream and the next
morning were again hidden by the woods and ravines.At five o'clock on the
morning of the 22d, Crook's men were nearly opposite the Confederate
center.Marching his men in perfect silence, by one o'clock he had arrived
at the left and front of the unsuspecting Early.By four o'clock he had
reached the east face of Little North Mountain, to the left and rear of
the Confederates.While the movement was being made, the main body of the
Federal army was engaging the attention of the Confederates in front.Just
before sundown, Crook's men plunged down the mountain side, from out of
the timbered cover.The Confederates were quick to see that they had been
trapped.They had been caught in a pocket and there was nothing for them
to do except to retreat or surrender.They preferred the former, which
was, according to General Gordon, "first stubborn and slow, then rapid,
then--a rout."After the battle of Fisher's Hill the pursuit still continued.The
Confederate regiments re-formed, and at times would stop and contest the
approach of the advancing cavalrymen.By the time the Union infantry would
reach the place, the retreating army would have vanished.Torbert had been
sent down Luray Valley in pursuit of the Confederate cavalry, with the
hope of scattering it and seizing New Market in time to cut off the
Confederate retreat from Fisher's Hill.But at Milford, in a narrow gorge,
General Wickham held Torbert and prevented the fulfilment of his plan; and
General Early's whole force was able to escape.Day after day this
continued until Early had taken refuge in the Blue Ridge in front of
Brown's Gap.Sheridan in the mean time
had gone into camp at Harrisonburg, and for some time the two armies lay
watching each other.The Federals were having difficulty in holding their
lines of supply.With the Valley practically given up by Early, Sheridan was anxious to
stop here.He wrote to Grant, "I think the best policy will be to let the
burning of the crops in the Valley be the end of the campaign, and let
some of this army go somewhere else."Grant's consent to this plan reached him on October 5th, and the following
day he started on his return march down the Shenandoah.His cavalry
extended across the entire valley.With the unsparing severity of war, his
men began to make a barren waste of the region.The October sky was
overcast with clouds of smoke and sheets of flame from the burning barns
and mills.As the army of Sheridan proceeded down the Valley, the undaunted cavaliers
of Early came in pursuit.His horsemen kept close to the rear of the Union
columns.On the morning of October 9th, the cavalry leader, Rosser, who
had succeeded Wickham, found himself confronted by General Custer's
division, at Tom's Brook.At the same time the Federal general, Wesley
Merritt, fell upon the cavalry of Lomax and Johnson on an adjacent road.The two Union forces were soon united and a mounted battle ensued.The
ground being level, the maneuvering of the squadrons was easy.The clink
of the sabers rang out in the morning air.The Confederate center held together, but its flanks gave way.The Federals charged along the whole front, with a momentum that forced
the Southern cavalrymen to flee from the field.They left in the hands of
the Federal troopers over three hundred prisoners, all their artillery,
except one piece, and nearly every wagon the Confederate cavalry had with
them.The Northern army continued its retrograde movement, and on the 10th
crossed to the north side of Cedar Creek.Early's army in the mean time
had taken a position at the wooded base of Fisher's Hill, four miles
away.The Sixth Corps started for Washington, but the news of Early at
Fisher's Hill led to its recall.The Union forces occupied ground that was
considered practically unassailable, especially on the left, where the
deep gorge of the Shenandoah, along whose front rose the bold Massanutten
Mountain, gave it natural protection.The movements of the Confederate army were screened by the wooded ravines
in front of Fisher's Hill, while, from the summit of the neighboring Three
Top Mountain, its officers could view, as in a panorama, the entire Union
camp.Seemingly secure, the corps of Crook on the left of the Union line
was not well protected.The keen-eyed Gordon saw the weak point in the
Union position.Ingenious plans to break it down were quickly made.Meanwhile, Sheridan was summoned to Washington to consult with Secretary
Stanton.He did not believe that Early proposed an immediate attack, and
started on the 15th, escorted by the cavalry, and leaving General Wright
in command.At Front Royal the next day word came from Wright enclosing a
message taken for the Confederate signal-flag on Three Top Mountain.It
was from Longstreet, advising Early that he would join him and crush
Sheridan.The latter sent the cavalry back to Wright, and continued on to
Washington, whence he returned at once by special train, reaching
Winchester on the evening of the 18th.Just after dark on October 18th, a part of Early's army under the command
of General John B. Gordon, with noiseless steps, moved out from their
camp, through the misty, autumn night.The men had been stripped of their
canteens, in fear that the striking of them against some object might
reveal their movements.Their path
followed along the base of the mountain--a dim and narrow trail, upon
which but one man might pass at a time.For seven miles this sinuous line
made its way through the dark gorge, crossing the Shenandoah, and at
times passing within four hundred yards of the Union pickets.It arrived at the appointed place, opposite Crook's camp on the Federal
right, an hour before the attack was to be made.In the shivering air of
the early morning, the men crouched on the river bank, waiting for the
coming of the order to move forward.At last, at five o'clock, it came.They plunged into the frosty water of the river, emerged on the other
side, marched in "double quick," and were soon sounding a reveille to the
sleeping troops of Sheridan.The minie balls whizzed and sang through the
tents.In the gray mists of the dawn the legions of the South looked like
phantom warriors, as they poured through the unmanned gaps.The
Northerners sprang to arms.Their eyes saw the flames from the Southern muskets; the men felt the
breath of the hot muzzles in their faces, while the Confederate bayonets
were at their breasts.There was a brief struggle, then panic and
disorganization.Only a quarter of an hour of this yelling and struggling,
and two-thirds of the Union army broke like a mill-dam and poured across
the fields, leaving their accouterments of war and the stiffening bodies
of their comrades.Rosser, with the cavalry, attacked Custer and assisted
Gordon.Meanwhile, during these same early morning hours, General Early had
himself advanced to Cedar Creek by a more direct route.At half-past three
o'clock his men had come in sight of the Union camp-fires.They waited
under cover for the approach of day.At the first blush of dawn and before
the charge of Gordon, Early hurled his men across the stream, swept over
the breastworks, captured the batteries and turned them upon the
unsuspecting Northerners.The Federal generals tried to stem the impending
disaster.From the east of the battlefield the solid lines of Gordon were
now driving the fugitives of Crook's corps by the mere force of momentum.Aides were darting hither and thither, trying to reassemble the crumbling
lines.The Nineteenth Corps, under Emory, tried to hold its ground; for a
time it fought alone, but after a desperate effort to hold its own, it,
too, melted away under the scorching fire.The fields to the rear of the
army were covered with wagons, ambulances, stragglers, and fleeing
soldiers.As it slowly fell to the rear it
would, at times, turn to fight.At last it found a place where it again
stood at bay.The men hastily gathered rails and constructed rude
field-works.At the same time the Confederates paused in their advance.There was scarcely any firing except for
the occasional roar of a long-range artillery gun.The Southerners seemed
willing to rest on their well-earned laurels of the morning.In the
language of the successful commander, it was "glory enough for one day."But the brilliant morning victory was about to be changed to a singular
afternoon defeat.During the morning's fight, when the Union troops were
being rapidly overwhelmed with panic, Rienzi, the beautiful jet-black
war-charger, was bearing his master, the commander of the Federal army, to
the field of disaster.Along the broad valley highway that leads from
Winchester, General Sheridan had galloped to where his embattled lines had
been reduced to a flying mob.While riding leisurely away from Winchester
about nine o'clock he had heard unmistakable thunder-peals of artillery.Realizing that a battle was on in the front, he hastened forward, soon to
be met, as he crossed Mill Creek, by the trains and men of his routed
army, coming to the rear with appalling rapidity.News from the field told him of the crushing defeat of his hitherto
invincible regiments.The road was blocked by the retreating crowds as
they pressed toward the rear.The commander was forced to take to the
fields, and as his steed, flecked with foam, bore him onward, the
disheartened refugees greeted him with cheers.Taking off his hat as he
rode, he cried, "We will go back and recover our camps."The words seemed
to inspire the demoralized soldiers.Stragglers fell into line behind him;
men turned to follow their magnetic leader back to the fight.Vaulting his horse over the low barricade of rails, he dashed to the crest
of the field.There was a flutter along the battle-line.The men from
behind their protecting wall broke into thunderous cheers.From the rear
of the soldiers there suddenly arose, as from the earth, a line of the
regimental flags, which waved recognition to their leader.Early made another assault
after one o'clock, but was easily repulsed.It was nearly four o'clock when the order for the Federal advance was
given.General Sheridan, hat in hand, rode in front of his infantry line
that his men might see him.The Confederate forces now occupied a series
of wooded crests.From out of the shadow of one of these timbered coverts,
a column of gray was emerging.The Union lines stood waiting for the
impending crash.It came in a devouring succession of volleys that
reverberated into a deep and sullen roar.The Union infantry rose as one
man and passed in among the trees.Then, suddenly,
there came a screaming, humming rush of shell, a roar of musketry mingling
with the yells of a successful charge.Again the firing ceased, except for
occasional outbursts.The Confederates had taken a new position and
reopened with a galling fire.General Sheridan dashed along the front of
his lines in personal charge of the attack.Again his men moved toward the
lines of Early's fast thinning ranks.The Union
cavalry swept in behind the fleeing troops of Early and sent, again, his
veteran army "whirling up the Valley."The battle of Cedar Creek was ended; the tumult died away.The Federal
loss had been about fifty-seven hundred; the Confederate over three
thousand.Fourteen hundred Union prisoners were sent to Richmond.Never
again would the gaunt specter of war hover over Washington.[Illustration: GENERAL JUBAL A. EARLY, THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER WHO

death of Jackson, one of Lee's most efficient subordinates.He was alert,
aggressive, resourceful.His very eccentricities, perhaps, made him all
the more successful as a commander of troops in the field."Old Jube's"

it was still an unfinished structure, betraying its incompleteness to

since the withdrawal of most of the troops whose duty it had been to guard
the city.Early's approach in July, 1864, found the Nation's capital
entirely unprotected.Naturally there was a flutter throughout the
peaceable groups of non-combatants that made up the population of
Washington at that time, as well as in official circles.There were less
than seventy thousand people living in the city in 1864, a large
proportion of whom were in some way connected with the Government.[Illustration: PROTECTING LOCOMOTIVES FROM THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER

such an attack as Early might be expected to make.Not only were these
guns hard to move to points of danger, but in the summer of '64 there were
no trained artillerists to man them.Big as they were, they gave Early no
occasion for alarm.[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO WASHINGTON FROM THE SOUTH--THE FAMOUS "CHAIN

reason why Early did not make his approach to the capital from the

the roads to Long Bridge (shown below), and there was no way of marching
troops into the city from the south, excepting over such exposed passages.Most of the troops left for the defense of the city were on the Virginia
side.Therefore Early wisely picked out the northern outposts as the more
vulnerable.Long Bridge was closely guarded at all times, like Chain
Bridge and the other approaches, and at night the planks of its floor were
removed.[Illustration: LONG BRIDGE AND THE CAPITOL ACROSS THE BROAD POTOMAC

Constant drill at the guns went on in the defenses of Washington
throughout the war.At its close in April, 1865, there were 68 enclosed
forts and batteries, whose aggregate perimeter was thirteen miles, 807
guns and 98 mortars mounted, and emplacements for 1,120 guns, ninety-three
unarmed batteries for field-guns, 35,711 yards of rifle-trenches, and
three block-houses encircling the Northern capital.The entire extent of
front of the lines was thirty-seven miles; and thirty-two miles of
military roads, besides those previously existing in the District of
Columbia, formed the means of interior communication.In all these forts
constant preparation was made for a possible onslaught of the
Confederates, and many of the troops were trained which later went to take
part in the siege of Petersburg where the heavy artillery fought bravely
as infantry.[Illustration]

After the disastrous clash of the two armies at Cold Harbor, Grant
remained a few days in his entrenchments trying in vain to find a weak
place in Lee's lines.The combatants were now due east of Richmond, and
the Federal general realized that it would be impossible at this time to
attain the object for which he had struggled ever since he crossed the
Rapidan on the 4th of May--to turn Lee's right flank and interpose his
forces between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.His opponent, one of the very greatest military leaders the
Anglo-Saxon race has produced, with an army of but little more than half
the number of the Federal host, had successfully blocked the attempts to
carry out this plan in three great battles and by a remarkable maneuver on
the southern bank of the North Anna, which had forced Grant to recross the
river and which will always remain a subject of curious interest to
students of the art of war.In one month the Union army had lost fifty-five thousand men, while the
Confederate losses had been comparatively small.The cost to the North had
been too great; Lee could not be cut off from his capital, and the most
feasible project was now to join in the move which heretofore had been the
special object of General Butler and the Army of the James, and attack
Richmond itself.South of the city, at a distance of twenty-one miles, was
the town of Petersburg.Its defenses were not strong, although General
Gillmore of Butler's army had failed in an attempt to seize them on the
10th of June.Three railroads converged here and these were main arteries
of Lee's supply.He sent
General W. F. Smith, who had come to his aid at Cold Harbor with the
flower of the Army of the James, back to Bermuda Hundred by water, as he
had come, with instructions to hasten to Petersburg before Lee could get
there.Smith arrived on the 15th and was joined by Hancock with the first
troops of the Army of the Potomac to appear, but the attack was not
pressed and Beauregard who, with only two thousand men, was in desperate
straits until Lee should reach him, managed to hold the inner line of
trenches.The last of Grant's forces were across the James by midnight of June 16th,
while Lee took a more westerly and shorter route to Petersburg.The
fighting there was continued as the two armies came up, but each Union
attack was successfully repulsed.At the close of day on the 18th both
opponents were in full strength and the greatest struggle of modern times
was begun.Impregnable bastioned works began to show themselves around
Petersburg.More than thirty miles of frowning redoubts connected
extensive breastworks and were strengthened by mortar batteries and
field-works which lined the fields near the Appomattox River.It was a
vast net of fortifications, but there was no formal siege of Lee's
position, which was a new entrenched line selected by Beauregard some
distance behind the rifle-pits where he had held out at such great odds
against Hancock and Smith.Grant, as soon as the army was safely protected, started to extend his
lines on the west and south, in order to envelop the Confederate right
flank.He also bent his energies to destroying the railroads upon which
Lee depended for supplies.On
June 22d two corps of the Union army set out for the Weldon Railroad, but
they became separated and were put to flight by A. P. Hill.The Federal
cavalry also joined in the work, but the vigilant Confederate horsemen
under W. H. F. Lee prevented any serious damage to the iron way, and by
July 2d the last of the raiders were back in the Federal lines, much the
worse for the rough treatment they had received.Now ensued some weeks of quiet during which both armies were
strengthening their fortifications.On June 25th Sheridan returned from
his cavalry raid on the Virginia Central Railroad running north from
Richmond.He had encountered Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee at Trevilian Station
on June 11th, and turned back after doing great damage to the railway.Ammunition was running short and he did not dare risk another engagement.Sheridan was destined not to remain long with the army in front of
Petersburg.Lee had detached a corps from his forces and, under Early, it
had been doing great damage in Maryland and Pennsylvania.So Grant's
cavalry leader was put at the head of an army and sent to the Shenandoah
valley to drive Early's troops from the base of their operations.Meanwhile the Federals were covertly engaged in an undertaking which was
fated to result in conspicuous failure.Some skilled miners from the upper
Schuylkill coal regions in the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania attached to the
Ninth Corps were boring a tunnel from the rear of the Union works
underneath the Confederate fortifications.Eight thousand pounds of
gunpowder were placed in lateral galleries at the end of the tunnel.At
twenty minutes to five on the morning of July 30th, the mine was exploded.A solid mass of earth and all manner of material shot two hundred feet
into the air.Three hundred human beings were buried in the debris as it
fell back into the gaping crater.The smoke had barely cleared away when
General Ledlie led his waiting troops into the vast opening.The horror of
the sight sickened the assailants, and in crowding into the pit they
became completely demoralized.In the confusion officers lost power to
reorganize, much less to control, their troops.The stunned and paralyzed Confederates were not long in recovering their
wits.Batteries opened upon the approach to the crater, and presently a
stream of fire was poured into the pit itself.General Mahone hastened up
with his Georgia and Virginia troops, and there were several desperate
charges before the Federals withdrew at Burnside's order.Grant had had
great expectations that the mine would result in his capturing Petersburg
and he was much disappointed.In order to get a part of Lee's army away
from the scene of what he hoped would be the final struggle, Hancock's
troops and a large force of cavalry had been sent north of the James, as
if a move on Richmond had been planned.In the mine fiasco on that fatal
July 30th, thirty-nine hundred men (nearly all from Burnside's corps) were
lost to the Union side.In the torrid days of mid-August Grant renewed his attacks upon the Weldon
Railroad, and General Warren was sent to capture it.He reached Globe
Tavern, about four miles from Petersburg, when he encountered General
Heth, who drove him back.Warren did not return to the Federal lines but
entrenched along the iron way.The next day he was fiercely attacked by
the Confederate force now strongly reenforced by Mahone.Mahone forced his way through the skirmish line and then
turned and fought his opponents from their rear.Another of his divisions
struck the Union right wing.In this extremity two thousand of Warren's
troops were captured and all would have been lost but for the timely
arrival of Burnside's men.Two days later the Southerners renewed the battle and now thirty cannon
poured volley after volley upon the Fifth and Ninth corps.The dashing
Mahone again came forward with his usual impetuousness, but the blue line
finally drove Lee's men back.And so the Weldon Railroad fell into the
hands of General Grant.Hancock, with the Second Corps, returned from the
north bank of the James and set to work to assist in destroying the
railway, whose loss was a hard blow to General Lee.It was not to be
expected that the latter would permit this work to continue unmolested and
on the 25th of August, A. P. Hill suddenly confronted Hancock, who
entrenched himself in haste at Ream's Station.This did not save the
Second Corps, which for the first time in its glorious career was put to
rout.Their very guns were captured and turned upon them.In the following weeks there were no actions of importance except that in
the last days of September Generals Ord and Birney, with the Army of the
James, captured Fort Harrison, on the north bank of that river, from
Generals Ewell and Anderson.The Federals were anxious to have it, since
it was an excellent vantage point from which to threaten Richmond.Meanwhile Grant was constantly extending his line to the west and by the
end of October it was very close to the South Side Railroad.On the 27th
there was a hard fight at Hatcher's Run, but the Confederates saved the
railway and the Federals returned to their entrenchments in front of
Petersburg.The active struggle now ceased, but Lee found himself each day in more
desperate straits.Sheridan had played sad havoc with such sources of
supply as existed in the rich country to the northwest.The Weldon
Railroad was gone and the South Side line was in imminent danger.Many went home for the winter on a promise
to return when the spring planting was done.Lee was loath to let them go,
but he could ill afford to maintain them, and the very life of their
families depended upon it.Those who remained at Petersburg suffered
cruelly from hunger and cold.They looked forward to the spring, although
it meant renewal of the mighty struggle.The Confederate line had been
stretched to oppose Grant's westward progress until it had become the
thinnest of screens.A man lost to Lee was almost impossible to replace,
while the bounties offered in the North kept Grant's ranks full.[Illustration: MAHONE, "THE HERO OF THE CRATER"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]General William Mahone, C. S. A. It was through the promptness and valor
of General Mahone that the Southerners, on July 30, 1864, were enabled to
turn back upon the Federals the disaster threatened by the hidden mine.On
the morning of the explosion there were but eighteen thousand Confederates
left to hold the ten miles of lines about Petersburg.Everything seemed to
favor Grant's plans for the crushing of this force.Immediately after the
mine was sprung, a terrific cannonade was opened from one hundred and
fifty guns and mortars to drive back the Confederates from the breach,
while fifty thousand Federals stood ready to charge upon the
panic-stricken foe.But the foe was not panic-stricken long.Colonel
McMaster, of the Seventeenth South Carolina, gathered the remnants of
General Elliott's brigade and held back the Federals massing at the Crater
until General Mahone arrived at the head of three brigades.At once he
prepared to attack the Federals, who at that moment were advancing to the
left of the Crater.In his inspiring
presence it swept with such vigor that the Federals were driven back and
dared not risk another assault.At the Crater, Lee had what Grant
lacked--a man able to direct the entire engagement.[Illustration: WHAT EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS OF POWDER DID

great mass of earth hurled skyward like a water-spout.As it spread out
into an immense cloud, scattering guns, carriages, timbers, and what were
once human beings, the front ranks broke in panic; it looked as if the
mass were descending upon their own heads.The men were quickly rallied;
across the narrow plain they charged, through the awful breach, and up the
heights beyond to gain Cemetery Ridge.But there were brave fighters on
the other side still left, and delay among the Federals enabled the
Confederates to rally and re-form in time to drive the Federals back down
the steep sides of the Crater.There, as they struggled amidst the
horrible debris, one disaster after another fell upon them.Huddled
together, the mass of men was cut to pieces by the canister poured upon
them from well-planted Confederate batteries.At last, as a forlorn hope,
the <DW52> troops were sent forward; and they, too, were hurled back into
the Crater and piled upon their white comrades.[Illustration: FORT MAHONE--"FORT DAMNATION"

Confederates as Fort Hell.Gracie's salient, further north on the

desperate effort of the Confederates to break through the Federal cordon.The views of Gracie's salient show the French form of chevaux-de-frise, a

SHERMAN'S FINAL CAMPAIGNS

    I only regarded the march from Atlanta to Savannah as a "shift of
    base," as the transfer of a strong army, which had no opponent, and
    had finished its then work, from the interior to a point on the sea
    coast, from which it could achieve other important results.I
    considered this march as a means to an end, and not as an essential
    act of war.Still, then as now, the march to the sea was generally
    regarded as something extraordinary, something anomalous, something
    out of the usual order of events; whereas, in fact, I simply moved
    from Atlanta to Savannah, as one step in the direction of Richmond, a
    movement that had to be met and defeated, or the war was necessarily
    at an end.--_General W. T. Sherman, in his "Memoirs."_


The march to the sea, in which General William T. Sherman won undying fame
in the Civil War, is one of the greatest pageants in the world's
warfare--as fearful in its destruction as it is historic in its import.But this was not Sherman's chief achievement; it was an easy task compared
with the great campaign between Chattanooga and Atlanta through which he
had just passed."As a military accomplishment it was little more than a
grand picnic," declared one of his division commanders, in speaking of the
march through Georgia and the Carolinas.Almost immediately after the capture of Atlanta, Sherman, deciding to
remain there for some time and to make it a Federal military center,
ordered all the inhabitants to be removed.General Hood pronounced the act
one of ingenious cruelty, transcending any that had ever before come to
his notice in the dark history of the war.Sherman insisted that his act
was one of kindness, and that Johnston and Hood themselves had done the
same--removed families from their homes--in other places.Many of the people of Atlanta chose to go southward,
others to the north, the latter being transported free, by Sherman's
order, as far as Chattanooga.Shortly after the middle of September, Hood moved his army from Lovejoy's
Station, just south of Atlanta, to the vicinity of Macon.Here Jefferson
Davis visited the encampment, and on the 22d he made a speech to the
homesick Army of Tennessee, which, reported in the Southern newspapers,
disclosed to Sherman the new plans of the Confederate leaders.These
involved nothing less than a fresh invasion of Tennessee, which, in the
opinion of President Davis, would put Sherman in a predicament worse than
that in which Napoleon found himself at Moscow.But, forewarned, the
Federal leader prepared to thwart his antagonists.The line of the Western
and Atlantic Railroad was more closely guarded.Divisions were sent to
Rome and to Chattanooga.Thomas was ordered to Nashville, and Schofield to
Knoxville.Recruits were hastened from the North to these points, in order
that Sherman himself might not be weakened by the return of too many
troops to these places.Hood, in the hope of leading Sherman away from Atlanta, crossed the
Chattahoochee on the 1st of October, destroyed the railroad above Marietta
and sent General French against Allatoona.It was the brave defense of
this place by General John M. Corse that brought forth Sherman's famous
message, "Hold out; relief is coming," sent by his signal officers from
the heights of Kenesaw Mountain, and which thrilled the North and inspired
its poets to eulogize Corse's bravery in verse.Corse had been ordered
from Rome to Allatoona by signals from mountain to mountain, over the
heads of the Confederate troops, who occupied the valley between.Reaching
the mountain pass soon after midnight, on October 5th, Corse added his
thousand men to the nine hundred already there, and soon after daylight
the battle began.General French, in command of the Confederates, first
summoned Corse to surrender, and, receiving a defiant answer, opened with
his guns.Nearly all the day the fire was terrific from besieged and
besiegers, and the losses on both sides were very heavy.During the battle Sherman was on Kenesaw Mountain, eighteen miles away,
from which he could see the cloud of smoke and hear the faint
reverberation of the cannons' boom.When he learned by signal that Corse
was there and in command, he said, "If Corse is there, he will hold out; I
know the man."And he did hold out, and saved the stores at Allatoona, at
a loss of seven hundred of his men, he himself being among the wounded,
while French lost about eight hundred.General Hood continued to move northward to Resaca and Dalton, passing
over the same ground on which the two great armies had fought during the
spring and summer.He destroyed the railroads, burned the ties, and
twisted the rails, leaving greater havoc, if possible, in a country that
was already a wilderness of desolation.For some weeks Sherman followed
Hood in the hope that a general engagement would result.He went on to the banks of the Tennessee opposite
Florence, Alabama.His army was lightly equipped, and Sherman, with his
heavily burdened troops, was unable to catch him.Sherman halted at
Gaylesville and ordered Schofield, with the Twenty-third Corps, and
Stanley, with the Fourth Corps, to Thomas at Nashville.Sherman thereupon determined to return to Atlanta, leaving General Thomas
to meet Hood's appearance in Tennessee.It was about this time that
Sherman fully decided to march to the sea.Some time before this he had
telegraphed to Grant: "Hood... can constantly break my roads.I would
infinitely prefer to make a wreck of the road... send back all my wounded
and worthless, and, with my effective army, move through Georgia, smashing
things to the sea."Grant thought it best for Sherman to destroy Hood's
army first, but Sherman insisted that his plan would put him on the
offensive rather than the defensive.He also believed that Hood would be
forced to follow him.Grant was finally won to the view that if Hood moved
on Tennessee, Thomas would be able to check him.He had, on the 11th of
October, given permission for the march.Now, on the 2d of November, he
telegraphed Sherman at Rome: "I do not really see that you can withdraw
from where you are to follow Hood without giving up all we have gained in
territory.I say, then, go on as you propose."It was Sherman, and not
Grant or Lincoln, that conceived the great march, and while the march
itself was not seriously opposed or difficult to carry out, the conception
and purpose were masterly.Sherman moved his army by slow and easy stages back to Atlanta.He sent
the vast army stores that had collected at Atlanta, which he could not
take with him, as well as his sick and wounded, to Chattanooga, destroyed
the railroad to that place, also the machine-shops at Rome and other
places, and on November 12th, after receiving a final despatch from Thomas
and answering simply, "Despatch received--all right," the last telegraph
line was severed, and Sherman had deliberately cut himself off from all
communication with the Northern States.There is no incident like it in
the annals of war.A strange event it was, as Sherman observes in his
memoirs."Two hostile armies marching in opposite directions, each in the
full belief that it was achieving a final and conclusive result in a great
war."For the next two days all was astir in Atlanta.The great depot,
round-house, and machine-shops were destroyed.Walls were battered down;
chimneys pulled over; machinery smashed to pieces, and boilers punched
full of holes.Heaps of rubbish covered the spots where these fine
buildings had stood, and on the night of November 15th the vast debris was
set on fire.The torch was also applied to many places in the business
part of the city, in defiance of the strict orders of Captain Poe, who
had the work of destruction in charge.The court-house and a large part of
the dwellings escaped the flames.Preparations for the great march were made with extreme care.Defective
wagons and horses were discarded; the number of heavy guns to be carried
along was sixty-five, the remainder having been sent to Chattanooga.The
marching army numbered about sixty thousand, five thousand of whom
belonged to the cavalry and eighteen hundred to the artillery.The army
was divided into two immense wings, the Right, the Army of the Tennessee,
commanded by General O. O. Howard, and consisting of the Fifteenth and
Seventeenth corps, and the Left, the Army of Georgia, by General Henry W.
Slocum, composed the Fourteenth and Twentieth corps.There were twenty-five hundred wagons, each drawn by
six mules; six hundred ambulances, with two horses each, while the heavy
guns, caissons, and forges were each drawn by eight horses.A twenty days'
supply of bread, forty of coffee, sugar, and salt was carried with the
army, and a large herd of cattle was driven on foot.In Sherman's general instructions it was provided that the army should
march by four roads as nearly parallel as possible, except the cavalry,
which remained under the direct control of the general commanding.The
army was directed "to forage liberally on the country," but, except along
the roadside, this was to be done by organized foraging parties appointed
by the brigade commanders.Orders were issued forbidding soldiers to enter
private dwellings or to commit any trespass.The corps commanders were
given the option of destroying mills, cotton-gins, and the like, and where
the army was molested in its march by the burning of bridges, obstructing
the roads, and so forth, the devastation should be made "more or less
relentless, according to the measure of such hostility."The cavalry and
artillery and the foraging parties were permitted to take horses, mules,
and wagons from the inhabitants without limit, except that they were to
discriminate in favor of the poor.It was a remarkable military
undertaking, in which it was intended to remove restrictions only to a
sufficient extent to meet the requirements of the march.The cavalry was
commanded by General Judson Kilpatrick, who, after receiving a severe
wound at Resaca, in May, had gone to his home on the banks of the Hudson,
in New York, to recuperate, and, against the advice of his physician, had
joined the army again at Atlanta.On November 15th, most of the great army was started on its march, Sherman
himself riding out from the city next morning.As he rode near the spot
where General McPherson had fallen, he paused and looked back at the
receding city with its smoking ruins, its blackened walls, and its lonely,
tenantless houses.The vision of the desperate battles, of the hope and
fear of the past few months, rose before him, as he tells us, "like the
memory of a dream."The day was as perfect as Nature ever gives.They sang and shouted and waved their banners in the
autumn breeze.Most of them supposed they were going directly toward
Richmond, nearly a thousand miles away.As Sherman rode past them they
would call out, "Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at
Richmond."Only the commanders of the wings and Kilpatrick were entrusted
with the secret of Sherman's intentions.But even Sherman was not fully
decided as to his objective--Savannah, Georgia, or Port Royal, South
Carolina--until well on the march.There was one certainty, however--he was fully decided to keep the
Confederates in suspense as to his intentions.To do this the more
effectually he divided his army at the start, Howard leading his wing to
Gordon by way of McDonough as if to threaten Macon, while Slocum proceeded
to Covington and Madison, with Milledgeville as his goal.Both were
secretly instructed to halt, seven days after starting, at Gordon and
Milledgeville, the latter the capital of Georgia, about a hundred miles to
the southeast.General Hood and General Beauregard, who had come from the East to assist
him, were in Tennessee, and it was some days after Sherman had left
Atlanta that they heard of his movements.They realized that to follow him
would now be futile.He was nearly three hundred miles away, and not only
were the railroads destroyed, but a large part of the intervening country
was utterly laid waste and incapable of supporting an army.The
Confederates thereupon turned their attention to Thomas, who was also in
Tennessee, and was the barrier between Hood and the Northern States.General Sherman accompanied first one corps of his army and then another.The first few days he spent with Davis' corps of Slocum's wing.When they
reached Covington, the <DW64>s met the troops in great numbers, shouting
and thanking the Lord that "deliverance" had come at last.As Sherman rode
along the streets they would gather around his horse and exhibit every
evidence of adoration.The foraging parties consisted of companies of fifty men.Their route for
the day in which they obtained supplies was usually parallel to that of
the army, five or six miles from it.They would start out before daylight
in the morning, many of them on foot; but when they rejoined the column in
the evening they were no longer afoot.They were astride mules, horses, in
family carriages, farm wagons, and mule carts, which they packed with
hams, bacon, vegetables, chickens, ducks, and every imaginable product of
a Southern farm that could be useful to an army.In the general orders, Sherman had forbidden the soldiers to enter private
houses; but the order was not strictly adhered to, as many Southern people
have since testified.Sherman declares in his memoirs that these acts of
pillage and violence were exceptional and incidental.On one occasion
Sherman saw a man with a ham on his musket, a jug of molasses under his
arm, and a big piece of honey in his hand.As the man saw that he was
observed by the commander, he quoted audibly to a comrade, from the
general order, "forage liberally on the country."But the general reproved
him and explained that foraging must be carried on only by regularly
designated parties.It is a part of military history that Sherman's sole purpose was to weaken
the Confederacy by recognized means of honorable warfare; but it cannot be
denied that there were a great many instances, unknown to him,
undoubtedly, of cowardly hold-ups of the helpless inhabitants, or
ransacking of private boxes and drawers in search of jewelry and other
family treasure.This is one of the misfortunes of war--one of war's
injustices.Such practices always exist even under the most rigid
discipline in great armies, and the jubilation of this march was such that
human nature asserted itself in the license of warfare more than on most
other occasions.General Washington met with similar situations in the
American Revolution.The practice is never confined to either army in
warfare.Opposed to Sherman were Wheeler's cavalry, and a large portion of the
Georgia State troops which were turned over by General G. W. Smith to
General Howell Cobb.Kilpatrick and his horsemen, proceeding toward Macon,
were confronted by Wheeler and Cobb, but the Federal troopers drove them
back into the town.However, they issued forth again, and on November 21st
there was a sharp engagement with Kilpatrick at Griswoldville.The
following day the Confederates were definitely checked and retreated.The night of November 22d, Sherman spent in the home of General Cobb, who
had been a member of the United States Congress and of Buchanan's Cabinet.Thousands of soldiers encamped that night on Cobb's plantation, using his
fences for camp-fire fuel.By Sherman's order, everything on the
plantation movable or destructible was carried away next day, or
destroyed.By the next night both corps of the Left Wing were at Milledgeville, and
on the 24th started for Sandersville.Howard's wing was at Gordon, and it
left there on the day that Slocum moved from Milledgeville for Irwin's
Crossroads.A hundred miles below Milledgeville was a place called Millen,
and here were many Federal prisoners which Sherman greatly desired to
release.With this in view he sent Kilpatrick toward Augusta to give the
impression that the army was marching thither, lest the Confederates
should remove the prisoners from Millen.Kilpatrick had reached Waynesboro
when he learned that the prisoners had been taken away.Here he again
encountered the Confederate cavalry under General Wheeler.A sharp fight
ensued and Kilpatrick drove Wheeler through the town toward Augusta.As
there was no further need of making a feint on Augusta, Kilpatrick turned
back toward the Left Wing.Wheeler quickly followed and at Thomas' Station
nearly surrounded him, but Kilpatrick cut his way out.Wheeler still
pressed on and Kilpatrick chose a good position at Buck Head Creek,
dismounted, and threw up breastworks.Wheeler attacked desperately, but
was repulsed, and Kilpatrick, after being reenforced by a brigade from
Davis' corps, joined the Left Wing at Louisville.On the whole, the great march was but little disturbed by the
Confederates.The Georgia militia, probably ten thousand in all, did what
they could to defend their homes and their firesides; but their endeavors
were futile against the vast hosts that were sweeping through the country.In the skirmishes that took place between Atlanta and the sea the militia
was soon brushed aside.Even their destroying of bridges and supplies in
front of the invading army checked its progress but for a moment, as it
was prepared for every such emergency.Wheeler, with his cavalry, caused
more trouble, and engaged Kilpatrick's attention a large part of the time.But even he did not seriously <DW44> the irresistible progress of the
legions of the North.The great army kept on its way by various routes, covering about fifteen
miles a day, and leaving a swath of destruction, from forty to sixty miles
wide, in its wake.Among the details attendant upon the march to the sea
was that of scientifically destroying the railroads that traversed the
region.Battalions of engineers had received special instruction in the
art, together with the necessary implements to facilitate rapid work.But
the infantry soon entered this service, too, and it was a common sight to
see a thousand soldiers in blue standing beside a stretch of railway, and,
when commanded, bend as one man and grasp the rail, and at a second
command to raise in unison, which brought a thousand railroad ties up on
end.Then the men fell upon them, ripping rail and tie apart, the rails to
be heated to a white heat and bent in fantastic shapes about some
convenient tree or other upright column, the ties being used as the fuel
with which to make the fires.All public buildings that might have a
military use were burned, together with a great number of private
dwellings and barns, some by accident, others wantonly.This fertile and
prosperous region, after the army had passed, was a scene of ruin and
desolation.As the army progressed, throngs of escaped slaves followed in its trail,
"from the baby in arms to the old <DW64> hobbling painfully along," says
General Howard, "<DW64>s of all sizes, in all sorts of patched costumes,
with carts and broken-down horses and mules to match."Many of the old
<DW64>s found it impossible to keep pace with the army for many days, and
having abandoned their homes and masters who could have cared for them,
they were left to die of hunger and exposure in that naked land.After the Ogeechee River was crossed, the character of the country was
greatly changed from that of central Georgia.No longer were there fertile
farms, laden with their Southern harvests of corn and vegetables, but
rather rice plantations and great pine forests, the solemn stillness of
which was broken by the tread of thousands of troops, the rumbling of
wagon-trains, and by the shouts and music of the marching men and of the
motley crowd of <DW64>s that followed.Day by day Sherman issued orders for the progress of the wings, but on
December 2d they contained the decisive words, "Savannah."What a tempting
prize was this fine Southern city, and how the Northern commander would
add to his laurels could he effect its capture!The memories clinging
about the historic old town, with its beautiful parks and its
magnolia-lined streets, are part of the inheritance of not only the South,
but of all America.Here Oglethorpe had bartered with the wild men of the
forest, and here, in the days of the Revolution, Count Pulaski and
Sergeant Jasper had given up their lives in the cause of liberty.Sherman had partially invested the city before the middle of December; but
it was well fortified and he refrained from assault.General Hardee, sent
by Hood from Tennessee, had command of the defenses, with about eighteen
thousand men.And there was Fort McAllister on the Ogeechee, protecting
the city on the south.But this obstruction to the Federals was soon
removed.General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth Corps was sent to
capture the fort.At five o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th Hazen's men
rushed through a shower of grape, over abatis and hidden torpedoes, scaled
the parapet and captured the garrison.That night Sherman boarded the
_Dandelion_, a Union vessel, in the river, and sent a message to the
outside world, the first since he had left Atlanta.Henceforth there was communication between the army and the Federal
squadron, under the command of Admiral Dahlgren.Among the vessels that
came up the river there was one that was received with great enthusiasm by
the soldiers.It brought mail, tons of it, for Sherman's army, the
accumulation of two months.One can imagine the eagerness with which
these war-stained veterans opened the longed-for letters and sought the
answer to the ever-recurring question, "How are things at home?"Sherman had set his heart on capturing Savannah; but, on December 15th, he
received a letter from Grant which greatly disturbed him.Grant ordered
him to leave his artillery and cavalry, with infantry enough to support
them, and with the remainder of his army to come by sea to Virginia and
join the forces before Richmond.Sherman prepared to obey, but hoped that
he would be able to capture the city before the transports would be ready
to carry him northward.He first called on Hardee to surrender the city, with a threat of
bombardment.Sherman hesitated to open with his guns
because of the bloodshed it would occasion, and on December 21st he was
greatly relieved to discover that Hardee had decided not to defend the
city, that he had escaped with his army the night before, by the one road
that was still open to him, which led across the Savannah River into the
Carolinas.The stream had been spanned by an improvised pontoon bridge,
consisting of river-boats, with planks from city wharves for flooring and
with old car-wheels for anchors.Sherman immediately took possession of
the city, and on December 22d he sent to President Lincoln this message:
"I beg to present to you, as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah, with
one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about
twenty-five thousand bales of cotton."As a matter of fact, over two
hundred and fifty guns were captured, and thirty-one thousand bales of
cotton.Events in the West now changed Grant's views as to Sherman's joining him
immediately in Virginia.On the 16th of December, General Thomas
accomplished the defeat and utter rout of Hood's army at Nashville.In
addition, it was found that, owing to lack of transports, it would take at
least two months to transfer Sherman's whole army by sea.Therefore, it
was decided that Sherman should march through the Carolinas, destroying
the railroads in both States as he went.A little more than a month
Sherman remained in Savannah.Then he began another great march, compared
with which, as Sherman himself declared, the march to the sea was as
child's play.The size of his army on leaving Savannah was practically the
same as when he left Atlanta--sixty thousand.It was divided into two
wings, under the same commanders, Howard and Slocum, and was to be
governed by the same rules.The
march from Savannah averaged ten miles a day, which, in view of the
conditions, was a very high average.The weather in the early part of the
journey was exceedingly wet and the roads were well-nigh impassable.Where
they were not actually under water the mud rendered them impassable until
corduroyed.Moreover, the troops had to wade streams, to drag themselves
through swamps and quagmires, and to remove great trees that had been
felled across their pathway.The city of Savannah was left under the control of General J. G. Foster,
and the Left Wing of Sherman's army under Slocum moved up the Savannah
River, accompanied by Kilpatrick, and crossed it at Sister's Ferry.The
river was overflowing its banks and the crossing, by means of a pontoon
bridge, was effected with the greatest difficulty.The Right Wing, under
Howard, embarked for Beaufort, South Carolina, and moved thence to
Pocotaligo, near the Broad River, whither Sherman had preceded it, and the
great march northward was fairly begun by February 1, 1865.Sherman had given out the word that he expected to go to Charleston or
Augusta, his purpose being to deceive the Confederates, since he had made
up his mind to march straight to Columbia, the capital of South Carolina.The two wings of the army were soon united and they continued their great
march from one end of the State of South Carolina to the other.The men
felt less restraint in devastating the country and despoiling the people
than they had felt in Georgia.The reason for this, given by Sherman and
others, was that there was a feeling of bitterness against South Carolina
as against no other State.It was this State that had led the procession
of seceding States and that had fired on Fort Sumter and brought on the
great war.No doubt this feeling, which pervaded the army, will account in
part for the reckless dealing with the inhabitants by the Federal
soldiery.The superior officers, however, made a sincere effort to
restrain lawlessness.On February 17th, Sherman entered Columbia, the mayor having come out and
surrendered the city.The Fifteenth Corps marched through the city and out
on the Camden road, the remainder of the army not having come within two
miles of the city.The conflagration
spread and ere the coming of the morning the best part of the city had
been laid in ashes.Before Sherman left Columbia he destroyed the machine-shops and everything
else which might aid the Confederacy.He left with the mayor one hundred
stand of arms with which to keep order, and five hundred head of cattle
for the destitute.As Columbia was approached by the Federals, the occupation of Charleston
by the Confederates became more and more untenable.In vain had the
governor of South Carolina pleaded with President Davis to reenforce
General Hardee, who occupied the city.Hardee thereupon evacuated the
historic old city--much of which was burned, whether by design or accident
is not known--and its defenses, including Fort Sumter, the bombardment of
which, nearly four years before, had precipitated the mighty conflict,
were occupied by Colonel Bennett, who came over from Morris Island.On March 11th, Sherman reached Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he
destroyed a fine arsenal.Hitherto, Sherman's march, except for the
annoyance of Wheeler's cavalry, had been but slightly impeded by the
Confederates.General Joseph B.
Johnston, his old foe of Resaca and Kenesaw Mountain, had been recalled
and was now in command of the troops in the Carolinas.No longer would the
streams and the swamps furnish the only resistance to the progress of the
Union army.The first engagement came at Averysboro on March 16th.General Hardee,
having taken a strong position, made a determined stand; but a division of
Slocum's wing, aided by Kilpatrick, soon put him to flight, with the loss
of several guns and over two hundred prisoners.The battle of Bentonville, which took place three days after that of
Averysboro, was more serious.Johnston had placed his whole army, probably
thirty-five thousand men, in the form of a V, the sides embracing the
village of Bentonville.Slocum engaged the Confederates while Howard was
hurried to the scene.On two days, the 19th and 20th of March, Sherman's
army fought its last battle in the Civil War.But Johnston, after making
several attacks, resulting in considerable losses on both sides, withdrew
his army during the night, and the Union army moved to Goldsboro.The
losses at Bentonville were: Federal, 1,527; Confederate, 2,606.At Goldsboro the Union army was reenforced by its junction with Schofield,
who had come out of the West with over twenty-two thousand men from the
army of Thomas in Tennessee.Sherman's third great march was practically over.As to the relative
importance of the second and third, Sherman declares in his memoirs, he
would place that from Atlanta to the sea at one, and that from Savannah
through the Carolinas at ten.Leaving his army in charge of Schofield, Sherman went to City Point, in
Virginia, where he had a conference with General Grant and President
Lincoln, and plans for the final campaign were definitely arranged.He
returned to Goldsboro late in March, and, pursuing Johnston, received,
finally, on April 26th the surrender of his army.[Illustration: BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]These two photographs of General Sherman were taken in 1864--the year that
made him an international figure, before his march to the sea which
electrified the civilized world, and exposed once for all the crippled
condition of the Confederacy.After that autumn expedition, the problem of
the Union generals was merely to contend with detached armies, no longer
with the combined States of the Confederacy.The latter had no means of
extending further support to the dwindling troops in the field.Sherman
was the chief Union exponent of the tactical gift that makes marches count
as much as fighting.In the early part of 1864 he made his famous raid
across Mississippi from Jackson to Meridian and back again, destroying the
railroads, Confederate stores, and other property, and desolating the
country along the line of march.In May he set out from Chattanooga for
the invasion of Georgia.For his success in this campaign he was
appointed, on August 12th, a major-general in the regular army.On
November 12th, he started with the pick of his men on his march to the
sea.After the capture of Savannah, December 21st, Sherman's fame was
secure; yet he was one of the most heartily execrated leaders of the war.There is a hint of a smile in the right-hand picture.The left-hand
portrait reveals all the sternness and determination of a leader
surrounded by dangers, about to penetrate an enemy's country against the
advice of accepted military authorities.[Illustration: THE ATLANTA BANK BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]As this photograph was taken, the wagons stood in the street of Atlanta
ready to accompany the Federals in their impending march to the sea.The
most interesting thing is the bank building on the corner, completely
destroyed, although around it stand the stores of merchants entirely
untouched.Evidently there had been here faithful execution of Sherman's
orders to his engineers--to destroy all buildings and property of a public
nature, such as factories, foundries, railroad stations, and the like; but
to protect as far as possible strictly private dwellings and enterprises.Those of a later generation who witnessed the growth of Atlanta within
less than half a century after this photograph was taken, and saw tall
office-buildings and streets humming with industry around the location in
this photograph, will find in it an added fascination.[Illustration: "TUNING UP"--A DAILY DRILL IN THE CAPTURED FORT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here Sherman's men are seen at daily drill in Atlanta.This photograph has
an interest beyond most war pictures, for it gives a clear idea of the
soldierly bearing of the men that were to march to the sea.There was an
easy carelessness in their appearance copied from their great commander,
but they were never allowed to become slouchy.Sherman was the antithesis
of a martinet, but he had, in the Atlanta campaign, molded his army into
the "mobile machine" that he desired it to be, and he was anxious to keep
the men up to this high pitch of efficiency for the performance of still
greater deeds.No better disciplined army existed in the world at the time
Sherman's "<DW15>s" set out for the sea.[Illustration: CUTTING LOOSE FROM THE BASE, NOVEMBER 12th

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB."On the 12th of November the railroad and telegraph communications with
the rear were broken and the army stood detached from all friends,
dependent on its own resources and supplies," writes Sherman.Meanwhile
all detachments were marching rapidly to Atlanta with orders to break up
the railroad en route and "generally to so damage the country as to make
it untenable to the enemy."Sherman, in
a home letter written from Grand Gulf, Mississippi, May 6, 1863, stated
clearly his views regarding the destruction of property.Speaking of the
wanton havoc wrought on a fine plantation in the path of the army, he
added: "It is done, of course, by the accursed stragglers who won't fight
but hang behind and disgrace our cause and country.Bowie had fled,
leaving everything on the approach of our troops.Of course, devastation
marked the whole path of the army, and I know all the principal officers
detest the infamous practice as much as I do.Of course, I expect and do
take corn, bacon, ham, mules, and everything to support an army, and don't
object much to the using of fences for firewood, but this universal
burning and wanton destruction of private property is not justified in
war."[Illustration: THE BUSTLE OF DEPARTURE FROM ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Sherman's men worked like beavers during their last few days in Atlanta.There was no time to be lost; the army was gotten under way with that
precision which marked all Sherman's movements.In the upper picture,
finishing touches are being put to the railroad, and in the lower is seen
the short work that was made of such public buildings as might be of the
slightest use in case the Confederates should recapture the town.As far
back as Chattanooga, while plans for the Atlanta campaign were being
formed, Sherman had been revolving a subsequent march to the sea in case
he was successful.He had not then made up his mind whether it should be
in the direction of Mobile or Savannah, but his Meridian campaign, in
Mississippi, had convinced him that the march was entirely feasible, and
gradually he worked out in his mind its masterly details.At seven in the
morning on November 16th, Sherman rode out along the Decatur road, passed
his marching troops, and near the spot where his beloved McPherson had
fallen, paused for a last look at the city."Behind us," he says, "lay
Atlanta, smouldering and in ruins, the black smoke rising high in air and
hanging like a pall over the ruined city."All about could be seen the
glistening gun-barrels and white-topped wagons, "and the men marching
steadily and rapidly with a cheery look and swinging pace."Some
regimental band struck up "John Brown," and the thousands of voices of the
vast army joined with a mighty chorus in song.A feeling of exhilaration
pervaded the troops.This marching into the unknown held for them the
allurement of adventure, as none but Sherman knew their destination.But
as he worked his way past them on the road, many a group called out,
"Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at Richmond."The
devil-may-care spirit of the troops brought to Sherman's mind grave
thoughts of his own responsibility.He knew that success would be regarded
as a matter of course, but should he fail the march would be set down as
"the wild adventure of a crazy fool."He had no intention of marching
directly to Richmond, but from the first his objective was the seacoast,
at Savannah or Port Royal, or even Pensacola, Florida.[Illustration: RUINS IN ATLANTA]


[Illustration: THE GUNS THAT SHERMAN TOOK ALONG

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In Hood's hasty evacuation of Atlanta many of his guns were left behind.These 12-pounder Napoleon bronze field-pieces have been gathered by the
Federals from the abandoned fortifications, which had been equipped
entirely with field artillery, such as these.It was an extremely useful
capture for Sherman's army, whose supply of artillery had been somewhat
limited during the siege, and still further reduced by the necessity to
fortify Atlanta.On the march to the sea Sherman took with him only
sixty-five field-pieces.The <DW64> refugees in the lower picture recall an
embarrassment of the march to the sea."<DW64>s of all sizes" flocked in
the army's path and stayed there, a picturesque procession, holding
tightly to the skirts of the army which they believed had come for the
sole purpose of setting them free.The cavalcade of <DW64>s soon became so
numerous that Sherman became anxious for his army's sustenance, and
finding an old gray-haired black at Covington, Sherman explained to him
carefully that if the <DW64>s continued to swarm after the army it would
fail in its purpose and they would not get their freedom.Sherman believed
that the old man spread this news to the slaves along the line of march,
and in part saved the army from being overwhelmed by the contrabands.[Illustration: <DW64>s FLOCKING IN THE ARMY'S PATH

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE DEFENDER OF SAVANNAH]

The task of General Hardee in defending Savannah was one of peculiar
difficulty.He had only eighteen thousand men, and he was uncertain where
Sherman would strike.Some supposed that Sherman would move at once upon
Charleston, but Hardee argued that the Union army would have to establish
a new base of supplies on the seacoast before attempting to cross the
numerous deep rivers and swamps of South Carolina.Hardee's task therefore
was to hold Savannah just as long as possible, and then to withdraw
northward to unite with the troops which General Bragg was assembling, and
with the detachments scattered at this time over the Carolinas.In
protecting his position around Savannah, Fort McAllister was of prime
importance, since it commanded the Great Ogeechee River in such a way as
to prevent the approach of the Federal fleet, Sherman's dependence for
supplies.It was accordingly manned by a force of two hundred under
command of Major G. W. Anderson, provided with fifty days' rations for use
in case the work became isolated.About
noon of December 13th, Major Anderson's men saw troops in blue moving
about in the woods.The artillery on the land side
of the fort was turned upon them as they advanced from one position to
another, and sharpshooters picked off some of their officers.At half-past
four o'clock, however, the long-expected charge was made from three
different directions, so that the defenders, too few in number to hold the
whole line, were soon overpowered.Hardee now had to consider more
narrowly the best time for withdrawing from the lines at Savannah.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER--THE LAST BARRIER TO THE SEA

any other city near the Atlantic seaboard.Stretching to the north, east,
and southward lay swamps and morasses through which ran the river-approach
of twelve miles to the town.Innumerable small creeks separated the
marshes into islands over which it was out of the question for an army to
march without first building roads and bridging miles of waterways.The
Federal fleet had for months been on the blockade off the mouth of the
river, and Savannah had been closed to blockade runners since the fall of
Fort Pulaski in April, 1862.But obstructions and powerful batteries held
the river, and Fort McAllister, ten miles to the south, on the Ogeechee,
still held the city safe in its guardianship.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER, THAT HELD THE FLEET AT BAY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Across these ditches at Fort McAllister, through entangling abatis, over
palisading, the Federals had to fight every inch of their way against the
Confederate garrison up to the very doors of their bomb-proofs, before the
defenders yielded on December 13th.Sherman had at once perceived that the
position could be carried only by a land assault.The fort was strongly
protected by ditches, palisades, and plentiful abatis; marshes and streams
covered its flanks, but Sherman's troops knew that shoes and clothing and
abundant rations were waiting for them just beyond it, and had any of them
been asked if they could take the fort their reply would have been in the
words of the poem: "Ain't we simply got to take it?"Sherman selected for
the honor of the assault General Hazen's second division of the Fifteenth
Corps, the same which he himself had commanded at Shiloh and Vicksburg.Gaily the troops crossed the bridge on the morning of the 13th.Sherman
was watching anxiously through his glass late in the afternoon when a
Federal steamer came up the river and signaled the query: "Is Fort
McAllister taken?"To which Sherman sent reply: "Not yet, but it will be
in a minute."At that instant Sherman saw Hazen's troops emerge from the
woods before the fort, "the lines dressed as on parade, with colors
flying."Immediately dense clouds of smoke belching from the fort
enveloped the Federals.There was a pause; the smoke cleared away, and,
says Sherman, "the parapets were blue with our men."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: A BIG GUN AT FORT McALLISTER

group of the men who had charged over these ramparts has arranged itself
before the camera as if in the very act of firing the great gun that
points seaward across the marshes, toward Ossabaw Sound.There is one very
peculiar thing proved by this photograph--the gun itself is almost in a
fixed position as regards range and sweep of fire.Instead of the
elevating screw to raise or depress the muzzle, there has been substituted
a block of wood wedged with a heavy spike, and the narrow pit in which the
gun carriage is sunk admits of it being turned but a foot or so to right
or left.It evidently controlled one critical point in the river, but
could not have been used in lending any aid to the repelling of General
Hazen's attack.The officer pointing with outstretched arm is indicating
the very spot at which a shell fired from his gun would fall.The men in
the trench are artillerymen of General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth
Corps; their appearance in their fine uniforms, polished breastplates and
buttons, proves that Sherman's men could not have presented the ragged
appearance that they are often pictured as doing in the war-time sketches.That Army and Navy have come together is proved also by the figure of a
marine from the fleet, who is standing at "Attention" just above the
breach of the gun.Next, leaning on his saber, is a cavalryman, in short
jacket and chin-strap.[Illustration: THE SPOILS OF VICTORY]

THE TROOPS THAT MARCHED TO THE SEA BECOME DAY-LABORERS

Here are the men that marched to the sea doing their turn as day-laborers,
gleefully trundling their wheelbarrows, gathering up everything of value
in Fort McAllister to swell the size of Sherman's "Christmas present."Brigadier-General W. B. Hazen, after his men had successfully stormed the
stubbornly defended fort, reported the capture of twenty-four pieces of
ordnance, with their equipment, forty tons of ammunition, a month's supply
of food for the garrison, and the small arms of the command.In the upper
picture the army engineers are busily at work removing a great 48-pounder
8-inch Columbiad that had so long repelled the Federal fleet.There is
always work enough and to spare for the engineers both before and after
the capture of a fortified position.In the wheelbarrows is a harvest of
shells and torpedoes.These deadly instruments of destruction had been
relied upon by the Confederates to protect the land approach to Fort
McAllister, which was much less strongly defensible on that side than at
the waterfront.While Sherman's army was approaching Savannah one of his
officers had his leg blown off by a torpedo buried in the road and stepped
on by his horse.After that Sherman set a line of Confederate prisoners
across the road to march ahead of the army, and no more torpedoes were
found.After the capture of Fort McAllister the troops set to work
gingerly scraping about wherever the ground seemed to have been disturbed,
trying to find and remove the dangerous hidden menaces to life.At last
the ground was rendered safe and the troops settled down to the occupation
of Fort McAllister where the bravely fighting little Confederate garrison
had held the key to Savannah.The city was the first to fall of the
Confederacy's Atlantic seaports, now almost locked from the outside world
by the blockade.By the capture of Fort McAllister, which crowned the
march to the sea, Sherman had numbered the days of the war.The fall of
the remaining ports was to follow in quick succession, and by Washington's
Birthday, 1865, the entire coast-line was to be in possession of the
Federals.[Illustration: SHERMAN'S TROOPS DISMANTLING FORT McALLISTER]

Sherman which finally led to that event.The two generals met there on

problem of patrolling the three thousand miles of coast, along which the
blockade must be made effective.In order to penetrate the intricate
inlets and rivers, light-draft fighting-vessels were required, and the
most immediate means of securing these was to purchase every sort of
merchant craft that could possibly be adapted to the purposes of war,
either as a fighting-vessel or as a transport.The ferryboat in the
picture has been provided with guns and her pilot-houses armored.A
casemate of iron plates has been provided for the gunners.The Navy
Department purchased and equipped in all one hundred and thirty-six
vessels in 1861, and by the end of the year had increased the number of
seamen in the service from 7,600 to over 22,000.Many of these new
recruits saw their first active service aboard the converted ferryboats,
tugboats, and other frail and unfamiliar vessels making up the nondescript
fleet that undertook to cut off the commerce of the South.The experience
thus gained under very unusual circumstances placed them of necessity
among the bravest sailors of the navy.[Illustration: THE LAST PORT CLOSED

carrying six hundred guns.The upper picture shows the nature of the

of this character they began to acquire a numerous fleet of swift steamers
from which it was difficult for any vessel to get away.The "Vance"
brought many a cargo to the hungry Southern ports, slipping safely by the
blockading fleet and back again till her shrewd Captain Willie felt that
he could give the slip to anything afloat.On her last trip she had safely
gotten by the Federal vessels lying off the harbor of Wilmington, North
Carolina, and was dancing gleefully on her way with a bountiful cargo of
cotton and turpentine when, on September 10, 1864, in latitude 34 deg.W., a vessel was sighted which rapidly bore down upon
her.It proved to be the "Santiago de Cuba," Captain O. S. Glisson.The
rapidity with which the approaching vessel overhauled him was enough to
convince Captain Willie that she was in his own class.The "Santiago de
Cuba" carried eleven guns, and the "Vance" humbly hove to, to receive the
prize-crew which took her to Boston, where she was condemned.In the
picture we see her lying high out of the water, her valuable cargo having
been removed and sold to enrich by prize-money the officers and men of her
fleet captor.[Illustration: A GREYHOUND CAUGHT--WRECK OF THE BLOCKADE-RUNNER "COLT"]

The wreck of this blockade-runner, the "Colt," lies off Sullivan's Island,

over, was strewn with just such sights as this.The bones of former
"greyhounds" became landmarks by which the still uncaptured
blockade-runners could get their bearings and lay a course to safety.If
one of these vessels were cut off from making port and surrounded by
Federal pursuers, the next best thing was to run her ashore in shallow
water, where the gunboats could not follow and where her valuable cargo
could be secured by the Confederates.A single cargo at war-time prices
was enough to pay more than the cost of the vessel.Regular auctions were
held in Charleston or Wilmington, where prices for goods not needed by the
Confederate Government were run up to fabulous figures.The business of
blockade-running was well organized abroad, especially in England.One
successful trip was enough to start the enterprise with a handsome profit.A blockade-runner like the "Kate," which made forty trips or more, would
enrich her owners almost beyond the dreams of avarice.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE RAM "STONEWALL"]

Here are two striking views in the Port Royal dry-dock of the Confederate
ram "Stonewall."When this powerful fighting-ship sailed from Copenhagen,
Jan.T. J. Page, C. S. N., the Federal
navy became confronted by its most formidable antagonist during the war.In March, 1863, the Confederacy had negotiated a loan of L3,000,000, and
being thus at last in possession of the necessary funds, Captain Bulloch
and Mr.Slidell arranged with M. Arman, who was a member of the
_Corps-Legislatif_ and proprietor of a large shipyard at Bordeaux, for the
construction of ironclad ships of war.Slidell had already received
assurances from persons in the confidence of Napoleon III that the
building of the ships in the French yards would not be interfered with,
and that getting them to sea would be connived at by the Government.Owing
to the indubitable proof laid before the Emperor by the Federal diplomats
at Paris, he was compelled to revoke the guarantee that had been given to
Slidell and Bulloch.A plan was arranged, however, by which M. Arman
should sell the vessels to various European powers; and he disposed of the
ironclad ram "Sphinx" to the Danish Government, then at war with Prussia.Delivery of the ship at Copenhagen was not made, however, till after the
war had ceased, and no trouble was experienced by the Confederates in
arranging for the purchase of the vessel.On January 24, 1865, she
rendezvoused off Quiberon, on the French coast; the remainder of her
officers, crew, and supplies were put aboard of her; the Confederate flag
was hoisted over her, and she was christened the "Stonewall."Already the
vessel was discovered to have sprung a leak, and Captain Page ran into
Ferrol, Spain.Here dock-yard facilities were at first granted, but were
withdrawn at the protest of the American Minister.While Captain Page was
repairing his vessel as best he could, the "Niagara" and the "Sacramento"
appeared, and after some weeks the "Stonewall" offered battle in vain.[Illustration]

THE LAST INVASION OF TENNESSEE--FRANKLIN--NASHVILLE


In the latter days of September, 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee
lay in the vicinity of Macon, Georgia.It was a dispirited body of men,
homesick and discouraged.For four long months, first under one leader and
then under another, it had opposed, step by step, Sherman's advance toward
Atlanta, and now that important strategic point was in the hands of the
Federal forces.About the middle of July the President of the Confederacy
had seen fit to remove Joseph E. Johnston from the command and replace him
with John B. Hood.The latter's habit of mind and methods of action led
the Richmond authorities to believe that he would proceed very differently
from Johnston, and in this he did not disappoint them.The results showed
that Johnston's Fabian policy was by far the better one under the
circumstances.Sherman had the stronger army, but he was compelled
constantly to detach portions of it in order to guard his lengthening line
of supplies.The one thing he desired most was that his opponent should
assume an aggressive attitude.Hood's idea was precipitation rather than
patience, and in consequence on the 2d of September General Slocum entered
the coveted city.On the 22d of that month President Davis visited the Southern Army, and
made a memorable address to the troops.He promised them--and they were
delighted at the news--that they would soon be back in Tennessee, for a
fresh invasion of that State had been planned.This would, declared the
speaker, place Sherman in a worse predicament than that in which Napoleon
found himself at Moscow.But the Federal general had at least the
advantage of learning what was going to happen to him, for the President's
words were reported verbatim in the Southern papers, and he prepared to
meet his antagonists.Thomas, with the Army of the Cumberland, was sent to
Nashville while Schofield, with his smaller force known as the Army of the
Ohio, returned to Knoxville where he had spent the previous winter, to
await Hood's advance.By the 1st of October the latter was across the
Chattahoochee in the hope of drawing Sherman from Atlanta.There was a
brave fight at Allatoona where General Corse "held the fort," but Sherman,
although he followed the Confederate army, was unable to bring on a
general engagement.His great plan of a march through Georgia to the sea was now fully formed
in his mind.He had not yet obtained Grant's sanction to the scheme, but
he ordered Schofield to cooperate with Thomas and sent the Fourth Corps as
further assistance.He himself ceased the pursuit of Hood at Gaylesville
and turned back to Atlanta, confident that the fate of Tennessee was safe
in the hands of his ablest lieutenant, George H. Thomas.Hood appeared on
the 26th of October at Decatur on the south bank of the Tennessee River.Lack of supplies had delayed his advance, but even so his performances had
greatly alarmed the North.Twice had he interposed between Sherman and the
Federal base and had destroyed many miles of railway, but what in other
circumstances would have placed the Union leader in a dangerous
predicament was now of little moment, since the latter was rapidly making
preparations to cut himself off from all communication with the source of
his supplies.It was necessary that Hood should have the assistance of
Forrest, whose dauntless cavalry had been playing great havoc with the
Federal stores in western Tennessee, so he moved to Florence before
crossing the river, and here Forrest joined him on November 14th.In the
meantime, Schofield, with about twenty-eight thousand men, had reached
Pulaski on the way to encounter the Southern advance.Now began a series of brilliant strategic moves, kept up for a fortnight
before the two small armies--they were of almost equal strength met in
one awful clash.Hood's efforts were bent toward cutting Schofield off
from Thomas at Nashville.There was a mad race for the Duck River, and the
Federals got over at Columbia in the very nick of time.The Southern
leader, by a skilful piece of strategy and a forced march, pushed on to
Spring Hill ahead of his opponent.He was in an excellent position to
annihilate General Stanley who was in advance, and then crush the
remainder of the Federals who were moving with the slow wagon-trains.But
owing to a number of strange mishaps, which brought forth much
recrimination but no satisfactory explanation, the Union army slipped by
with little damage and entrenched itself at Franklin on the Harpeth River.Of all the dark days of Confederate history--and they were many--the 29th
of November, 1864, has been mourned as that of "lost opportunities."Schofield did not expect, or desire, a battle at Franklin, but he was
treated to one the following afternoon when the Confederates came up, and
it was of the most severe nature.The first attack was made as the light
began to wane, and the Federal troops stood their ground although the
orders had been to withdraw, because through some blunder two brigades in
blue had been stationed, unsupported, directly in front of Hood's
approach.The stubborn resistance of Schofield's army only increased the
ardor of the opponents.It is said that thirteen separate assaults were
made upon the Union entrenchments, and the fearful carnage was finally
carried into the streets and among the dooryards of the little town.At
nine o'clock the fury of the iron storm was quelled.Five Confederate
generals, including the gallant Cleburne, lay dead upon the field.In two
of the Southern brigades all the general officers were either killed or
wounded.Hood's loss was about sixty-three hundred, nearly three times
that of Schofield.By midnight the latter was on his way, uninterrupted,
to Nashville.Meanwhile Thomas was performing a herculean task within the
fortifications of that capital city.He had received a large number of
raw recruits and a motley collection of troops from garrisons in the West.These had to be drilled into an efficient army, and not one move to fight
would Thomas make until this had been done.Grant, in Virginia, grew
impatient and the Northern papers clamored for an attack on Hood, who had
now arrived with thirty-eight thousand men before the city.Finally Grant
took action, and General Logan was hurrying to assume the Federal command.But by the time he reached Louisville there was no need for his services.Thomas had for some days been ready with his force of forty-five thousand,
but to increase the difficulties of his position, a severe storm of
freezing rain made action impossible until the morning of December 15th.The Union lines of defense were in a semi-circle and Hood was on the
southeast, lightly entrenched.The first assault on his right wing
followed by one on his left, forced the Confederates back to a second
position two miles to the south, and that was the first day's work.Hood
had detached a part of his forces and he did all he could to gain time
until he might recover his full strength.But he had respite only until
Thomas was ready on the morrow, which was about noon.The Union army
deployed in front of the Southerners and overlapped their left wing.An
attack on the front was bravely met and repulsed by the Confederates, and
the Federal leader, extending his right, compelled his opponent to stretch
his own lines more and more.Finally they broke just to the left of the
center, and a general forward movement on the Union side ended in the
utter rout of the splendid and courageous Army of Tennessee.It melted away in disorder; the pursuit was vigorous, and only a small
portion reassembled at Columbia and fell back with a poor show of order
behind the Tennessee.Many military historians have seen in the battle of Nashville the most
crushing defeat of the war.Certainly no other brought such complete ruin
upon a large and well-organized body of troops.[Illustration: RUSHING A FEDERAL BATTERY OUT OF JOHNSONVILLE

garrison at this same Johnsonville that, a month earlier, had been
frightened into panic and flight when the bold Confederate raider,
Forrest, appeared on the west bank of the river and began a noisy
cannonade.The day after the photograph was taken (November 23d) the
encampment in the picture was broken.[Illustration: FORT NEGLEY, LOOKING TOWARD THE CONFEDERATE CENTER AND

THE SIEGE AND FALL OF PETERSBURG

    It is not improbable that Grant might have made more headway by
    leaving a sufficient part of his army in the trenches in front of
    Petersburg and by moving with a heavy force far to the west upon Lee's
    communications; or, if it were determined to capture the place _a main
    forte_, by making a massed attack upon some point in the center after
    suitable mining operations had weakened Lee's defenses and prepared
    for such an operation.But the end was to come with opening spring.To
    the far-sighted, this was no longer doubtful.The South must succumb
    to the greater material resources of the North, despite its courage
    and its sacrifices.--_Colonel T. A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye
    View of Our Civil War."_


During the winter of 1864-65, General Lee, fighting Grant without, was
fighting famine within.The shivering, half-clad soldiers of the South
crouched over feeble fires in their entrenchments.The men were exposed to
the rain, snow, and sleet; sickness and disease soon added their horrors
to the desolation.The
life of the Confederacy was ebbing fast.Behind Union breastworks, early in 1865, General Grant was making
preparations for the opening of a determined campaign with the coming of
spring.Mile after mile had been added to his entrenchments, and they now
extended to Hatcher's Run on the left.The Confederate lines had been
stretched until they were so thin that there was constant danger of
breaking.A. P. Hill was posted on the right; Gordon and Anderson held the
center, and Longstreet was on the left.Union troops were mobilizing in
front of Petersburg.By February 1st, Sherman was fairly off from Savannah
on his northward march to join Grant.He was weak in cavalry and Grant
determined to bring Sheridan from the Shenandoah, whence the bulk of
Early's forces had been withdrawn, and send him to assist Sherman.Sheridan left Winchester February 27th, wreaking much destruction as he
advanced, but circumstances compelled him to seek a new base at White
House.On March 27th he formed a junction with the armies of the Potomac
and the James.Such were the happenings that prompted Lee to prepare for
the evacuation of Petersburg.And he might be able, in his rapid marches,
to outdistance Grant, join his forces with those of Johnston, fall on
Sherman, destroy one wing of the Union army and arouse the hopes of his
soldiers, and prolong the life of his Government.General Grant knew the condition of Lee's army and, with the unerring
instinct of a military leader, surmised what the plan of the Southern
general must be.He decided to move on the left, destroy both the Danville
and South Side railroads, and put his army in better condition to pursue.General Lee, in order to get Grant to look another way for a while,
decided to attack Grant's line on the right, and gain some of the works.This would compel Grant to draw some of his force from his left and secure
a way of escape to the west.This bold plan was left for execution to the
gallant Georgian, General John B. Gordon, who had successfully led the
reverse attack at Cedar Creek, in the Shenandoah, in October, 1864.Near
the crater stood Fort Stedman.Between it and the Confederate front, a
distance of about one hundred and fifty yards, was a strip of firm earth,
in full view of both picket lines.Across this space some deserters had
passed to the Union entrenchments.General Gordon took advantage of this
fact and accordingly selected his men, who, at the sound of the signal
gun, should disarm the Federal pickets, while fifty more men were to cross
the open space quickly with axes and cut away the abatis, and three
hundred others were to rush through the opening, and capture the fort and
guns.At four o'clock on the morning of March 25, 1865, Gordon had everything in
readiness.His chosen band wore white strips of cloth across the breast,
that they might distinguish each other in the hand-to-hand fight that
would doubtless ensue.Behind these men half of Lee's army was massed to
support the attack.In the silence of the early morning, a gunshot rang
out from the Confederate works.Not a Federal picket-shot was heard.The
axemen rushed across the open and soon the thuds of their axes told of the
cutting away of the abatis.The three hundred surged through the entrance,
overpowered the gunners, captured batteries to the right and to the left,
and were in control of the situation.Gordon's corps of about five
thousand was on hand to sustain the attack but the remaining reserves,
through failure of the guides, did not come, and the general found himself
cut off with a rapidly increasing army surrounding him.Fort Haskell, on the left, began to throw its shells.Under its cover,
heavy columns of Federals sent by General Parke, now commanding the Ninth
Corps, pressed forward.The Confederates resisted the charge, and from the
captured Fort Stedman and the adjoining batteries poured volley after
volley on Willcox's advancing lines of blue.The Northerners fell back,
only to re-form and renew the attack.This time they secured a footing,
and for twenty minutes the fighting was terrific.Then across the brow of the hill swept the command of Hartranft.The furious musketry, and
artillery directed by General Tidball, shrivelled up the ranks of Gordon
until they fled from the fort and its neighboring batteries in the midst
of withering fire, and those who did not were captured.This was the last
aggressive effort of the expiring Confederacy in front of Petersburg, and
it cost three thousand men.The affair at Fort Stedman did not turn Grant from his plans against the
Confederate right.With the railroads here destroyed, Richmond would be
completely cut off.On the morning of the 29th, as previously arranged,
the movement began.Sheridan swept to the south with his cavalry, as if he
were to fall upon the railroads.General Warren, with fifteen thousand
men, was working his way through the tangled woods and low swamps in the
direction of Lee's right.At the same time, Lee stripped his entrenchments
at Petersburg as much as he dared and hurried General Anderson, with
infantry, and Fitzhugh Lee, with cavalry, forward to hold the roads over
which he hoped to escape.On Friday morning, March 31st, the opposing
forces, the Confederates much reenforced, found themselves at Dinwiddie
Court House.The woods and swamps prevented the formation of a regular
line of battle.Lee made his accustomed flank movement, with heavy loss to
the Federals as they tried to move in the swampy forests.The Northerners
finally were ready to advance when it was found that Lee had fallen back.During the day and night, reenforcements were coming in from all sides.The Confederates had taken their position at Five Forks.Early the next afternoon, the 1st of April, Sheridan, reenforced by
Warren, was arranging his troops for battle.The day was nearly spent when
all was in readiness.The sun was not more than two hours high when the
Northern army moved toward that of the South, defended by a breastwork
behind a dense undergrowth of pines.Through this mass of timber the
Federals crept with bayonets fixed.They charged upon the Confederates,
but, at the same time, a galling fire poured into them from the left,
spreading dismay and destruction in their midst.The intrepid Sheridan
urged his black battle-charger, the famous Rienzi, now known as
Winchester, up and down the lines, cheering his men on in the fight.He
seemed to be everywhere at once.The Confederate left was streaming down
the White Oak Road.But General Crawford had reached a cross-road, by
taking a circuitous route, and the Southern army was thus shut off from
retreat.The Federal cavalry had dismounted and was doing its full share
of work.The Confederates soon found themselves trapped, and the part of
their army in action that day was nearly annihilated.With night came the news of the crushing blow to Lee.General Grant was
seated by his camp-fire surrounded by his staff, when a courier dashed
into his presence with the message of victory.Soon from every great gun
along the Union line belched forth the sheets of flame.The earth shook
with the awful cannonade.Mortar shells made huge parabolas through the
air.The Union batteries crept closer and closer to the Confederate lines
and the balls crashed into the streets of the doomed city.At dawn of the 2nd of April the grand assault began.The Federal troops
sprang forward with a rush.Despite the storms of grape and canister, the
Sixth Corps plunged through the battery smoke, and across the walls,
pushing the brave defenders to the inner works.The whole corps penetrated
the lines and swept everything before it toward Hatcher's Run.Some of the
troops even reached the South Side Railroad, where the brave General A. P.
Hill fell mortally wounded.Everywhere, the blue masses poured into the works.General Ord, on the
right of the Sixth Corps, helped to shut the Confederate right into the
city.General Parke, with the Ninth Corps, carried the main line.The thin
gray line could no longer stem the tide that was engulfing it.The
Confederate troops south of Hatcher's Run fled to the west, and fought
General Miles until General Sheridan and a division from Meade appeared on
the scene.By noon the Federals held the line of the outer works from Fort
Gregg to the Appomattox.The last stronghold carried was Fort Gregg, at
which the men of Gibbon's corps had one of the most desperate struggles of
the war.The Confederates now fell back to the inner fortifications and
the siege of Petersburg came to an end.[Illustration: A BATTERED RELIC OF COLONIAL DAYS IN PETERSBURG

days of buckles and small clothes; it wears an aggrieved and surprised
look, as if wondering why it should have received such buffetings as its
pierced walls, its shattered windows and doorway show.Yet it was more
fortunate than some of its near-by neighbors, which were never again after
the visitation of the falling shells fit habitations for mankind.Many of
these handsome residences were utterly destroyed, their fixtures shattered
beyond repair; their wainscoting, built when the Commonwealth of Virginia
was ruled over by the representative of King George, was torn from the
walls and, bursting into flames, made a funeral pyre of past comforts and
magnificence.The havoc wrought upon the dwellings of the town was heavy;
certain localities suffered more than others, and those residents who
seemed to dwell in the safest zones had been ever ready to open their
houses to the sick and wounded of Lee's army.As Grant's troops marched
in, many pale faces gazed out at them from the windows, and at the
doorsteps stood men whose wounds exempted them from ever bearing arms
again.[Illustration: THE SHATTERED DOORWAY

"Fort Hell."Directly opposite was the Confederate Fort Mahone, which the
Federals, returning the compliment, had dubbed "Fort Damnation."Between
the two lines, separated by only fifty yards, sallies and counter-sallies
were continual occurrences after dark.In stealthy sorties one side or the
other frequently captured the opposing pickets before alarm could be

European models, the same as employed in the Napoleonic wars, and were
used by both besiegers and besieged along the lines south of the
Appomattox.Those shown in this picture were in front of the entrenchments
near Elliott's salient and show how effectually it was protected from any

infantry.Not far from here lies the excavation of the Crater.[Illustration: GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON, C. S.To this gallant young Georgia officer, just turned thirty-three at the
time, Lee entrusted the last desperate effort to break through the
tightening Federal lines, March 25, 1865.Lee was confronted by the
dilemma of either being starved out of Petersburg and Richmond, or of
getting out himself and uniting his army to that of Johnston in North
Carolina to crush Sherman before Grant could reach him.Gordon was to
begin this latter, almost impossible, task by an attack on Fort Stedman,
which the Confederates believed to be the weakest point in the Federal
fortifications.The position had been captured from them in the beginning,
and they knew that the nature of the ground and its nearness to their own
lines had made it difficult to strengthen it very much.It was planned to
surprise the fort before daylight.Below are seen the rabbit-like burrows
of Gracie's Salient, past which Gordon led his famished men.When the
order came to go forward, they did not flinch, but hurled themselves
bravely against fortifications far stronger than their own.Three columns
of a hundred picked men each moved down the <DW72> shown on the left and
advanced in the darkness against Stedman.They were to be followed by a
division.Through the gap which the storming parties were expected to open
in the Federal lines, Gordon's columns would rush in both directions and a
cavalry force was to sweep on and destroy the pontoon bridges across the
Appomattox and to raid City Point, breaking up the Federal base.It was no
light task, for although Fort Stedman itself was weak, it was flanked by
Battery No.An
attacking party on the right would be exposed to an enfilading fire in
crossing the plain; while on the left the approach was difficult be cause
of ravines, one of which the Confederate engineers had turned into a pond
by damming a creek.All night long General Gordon's wife, with the brave
women of Petersburg, sat up tearing strips of white cloth, to be tied on
the arms of the men in the storming parties so that they could tell friend
from foe in the darkness and confusion of the assault.Before the
sleep-dazed Federals could offer effective resistance, Gordon's men had
possession of the fort and the batteries.Only after one of the severest
engagements of the siege were the Confederates driven back.[Illustration: GRACIE'S SALIENT--AFTER GORDON'S FORLORN HOPE HAD CHARGED]


APRIL SECOND--"THIS IS A SAD BUSINESS"

As his general watched, this boy fought to stem the Federal rush--but
fell, his breast pierced by a bayonet, in the trenches of Fort Mahone.It
is heart-rending to look at a picture such as this; it is sad to think of
it and to write about it.Here is a boy of only fourteen years, his face
innocent of a razor, his feet unshod and stockingless in the bitter April
weather.It is to be hoped that the man who slew him has forgotten it, for
this face would haunt him surely.Many who fought in the blue ranks were
young, but in the South there were whole companies made up of such boys as
this.At the battle of Newmarket the scholars of the Virgina Military
Institute, the eldest seventeen and the youngest twelve, marched from the
classrooms under arms, joined the forces of General Breckinridge, and
aided by their historic charge to gain a brilliant victory over the
Federal General Sigel.The never-give-in spirit was implanted in the youth
of the Confederacy, as well as in the hearts of the grizzled veterans.Lee
had inspired them, but in addition to this inspiration, as General Gordon
writes, "every man of them was supported by their extraordinary
consecration, resulting from the conviction that he was fighting in the
defense of home and the rights of his State.Hence their unfaltering faith
in the justice of the cause, their fortitude in the extremest privations,
their readiness to stand shoeless and shivering in the trenches at night
and to face any danger at their leader's call."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.APPOMATTOX

    I now come to what I have always regarded--shall ever regard--as the
    most creditable episode in all American history--an episode without a
    blemish, imposing, dignified, simple, heroic.Two men met that day, representative of American civilization, the
    whole world looking on.The two were Grant and Lee--types each.Both
    rose, and rose unconsciously, to the full height of the occasion--and
    than that occasion there has been none greater.About it, and them,
    there was no theatrical display, no self-consciousness, no effort at
    effect.A great crisis was to be met; and they met that crisis as
    great countrymen should.Consider the possibilities; think for a
    moment of what that day might have been; you will then see cause to
    thank God for much.--_General Charles Francis Adams, U. S. V., in Phi
    Beta Kappa Address delivered at the University of Chicago, June 17,
    1902._


We are now to witness the closing scene of one of the greatest tragedies
ever enacted on the world's stage.Many and varied had been the scenes
during the war; the actors and their parts had been real.The wounds of
the South were bleeding; the North was awaiting the decisive blow.Fortunes, great and small, had melted away
by the hundreds of millions.In Richmond, the citadel of the waning
Confederacy, the people were starving.The Southern army, half clad and
without food, was but a shadow of its once proud self.Bravely and long
the men in gray had followed their adored leader.Now the limit of
endurance had been reached.It was the second day of April, 1865.Lee realized that after Petersburg
his beloved Richmond must fall.The order was given for the movement to
begin at eight o'clock that night.The darkness of the early morning of
the 3d was suddenly transformed into a lurid light overcasting the
heavens for miles around the famous city whose name had became a
household word over the civilized world.The
capital of the Confederacy, the pride of the South, toward which the Army
of the Potomac had fought its way, leaving a trail of blood for four weary
years, had at last succumbed to the overwhelming power of Grant's
indomitable armies.President Davis had received a despatch while attending services at St.Paul's church, Sunday morning, the 2d, advising him that the city must be
evacuated that night, and, leaving the church at once, he hastened the
preparations for flight with his personal papers and the archives of the
Confederate Government.During that Sabbath day and night Richmond was in
a state of riot.There had been an unwarranted feeling of security in the
city, and the unwelcome news, spreading like an electric flash, was
paralyzing and disastrous in its effect.Prisoners were released from
their toils, a lawless mob overran the thoroughfares, and civic government
was nullified.One explosion after another, on the morning of the 3d, rent
the air with deafening roar, as the magazines took fire.The scene was one
of terror and grandeur.The flames spread to the city from the ships, bridges, and arsenal, which
had been set on fire, and hundreds of buildings, including the best
residential section of the capital of the Confederacy, were destroyed.When the Union army entered the city in the morning, thousands of the
inhabitants, men, women, and children, were gathered at street corners and
in the parks, in wildest confusion.The commissary depot had been broken
open by the starving mob, and rifled of its contents, until the place was
reached by the spreading flames.The Federal soldiers stacked arms, and
heroically battled with the fire, drafting into the work all able-bodied
men found in the city.The invaders extinguished the flames, and soon
restored the city to a state of order and safety.The invalid wife of
General Lee, who was exposed to danger, was furnished with an ambulance
and corporal's guard until the danger was past.President Lincoln, who had visited Grant at Petersburg, entered Richmond
on the 4th of April.He visited President Davis' house, and Libby Prison,
then deserted, and held a conference with prominent citizens and army
officers of the Confederacy.The President seemed deeply concerned and
weighted down with the realization of the great responsibilities that
would fall upon him after the war.Only ten days later the nation was
shaken from ocean to ocean by the tragic news of his assassination.General Lee had started on his last march by eight o'clock on the night of
the 2d.By midnight the evacuation of both Petersburg and Richmond was
completed.For nine months the invincible forces of Lee had kept a foe of
more than twice their numerical strength from invading their stronghold,
and only after a long and harassing siege were they forced to retreat.They saw the burning city as their line of march was illuminated by the
conflagration, and emotions too deep for words overcame them.The woods
and fields, in their fresh, bright colors of spring, were in sharp
contrast to the travel-worn, weather-beaten, ragged veterans passing over
the verdant plain.Lee hastened the march of his troops to Amelia Court
House, where he had ordered supplies, but by mistake the train of supplies
had been sent on to Richmond.This was a crushing blow to the hungry men,
who had been stimulated on their tiresome march by the anticipation of
much-needed food.The fatality of war was now hovering over them like a
huge black specter.General Grant did not proceed to Richmond, but leaving General Weitzel to
invest the city, he hastened in pursuit of Lee to intercept the retreating
army.This pursuit was started early on the 3d.On the evening of that
date there was some firing between the pursuing army and Lee's rear guard.It was Lee's design to concentrate his force at Amelia Court House, but
this was not to be accomplished by the night of the 4th.Not until the 5th
was the whole army up, and then it was discovered that no adequate
supplies were within less than fifty miles.Subsistence could be obtained
only by foraging parties.No word of complaint from the suffering men
reached their commander, and on the evening of that disappointing day they
patiently and silently began the sad march anew.Their course was through
unfavorable territory and necessarily slow.The Federals were gaining upon
their retreating columns.Sheridan's cavalry had reached their flank, and
on the 6th there was heavy skirmishing.In the afternoon the Federals had
arrived in force sufficient to bring on an engagement with Ewell's corps
in the rear, at Sailor's Creek, a tributary of the Appomattox River.Ewell
was surrounded by the Federals and the entire corps captured.General
Anderson, commanding the divisions of Pickett and Johnson, was attacked
and fought bravely, losing many men.In all about six thousand Confederate
soldiers were left in the hands of the pursuing army.On the night of the 6th, the remainder of the Confederate army continued
the retreat and arrived at Farmville, where the men received two days'
rations, the first food except raw or parched corn that had been given
them for two days.Again the tedious journey was resumed, in the hope of
breaking through the rapidly-enmeshing net and forming a junction with
Johnston at Danville, or of gaining the protected region of the mountains
near Lynchburg.But the progress of the weak and weary marchers was slow
and the Federal cavalry had swept around to Lee's front, and a halt was
necessary to check the pursuing Federals.On the evening of the 8th, Lee
reached Appomattox Court House.Here ended the last march of the Army of
Northern Virginia.General Lee and his officers held a council of war on the night of the 8th
and it was decided to make an effort to cut their way through the Union
lines on the morning of the next day.On the 7th, while at Farmville, on
the south side of the Appomattox River, Grant sent to Lee a courteous
request for the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, based on the
hopelessness of further resistance on the part of that army.In reply, Lee
expressed sympathy with Grant's desire to avoid useless effusion of blood
and asked the terms of surrender.The next morning General Grant replied to Lee, urging that a meeting be
designated by Lee, and specifying the terms of surrender, to which Lee
replied promptly, rejecting those terms, which were, that the Confederates
lay down their arms, and the men and officers be disqualified for taking
up arms against the Government of the United States until properly
exchanged.When Grant read Lee's letter he shook his head in
disappointment and said, "It looks as if Lee still means to fight; I will
reply in the morning."On the 9th Grant addressed another communication to Lee, repeating the
terms of surrender, and closed by saying, "The terms upon which peace can
be had are well understood.By the South laying down their arms they will
hasten that most desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and
hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed.Sincerely hoping that
all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, I
subscribe myself, etc."There remained for Lee the bare possibility, by desperate fighting, of
breaking through the Federal lines in his rear.To Gordon's corps was
assigned the task of advancing on Sheridan's strongly supported front.Since Pickett's charge at Gettysburg there had been no more hopeless
movement in the annals of the war.It was not merely that Gordon was
overwhelmingly outnumbered by the opposing forces, but his
hunger-enfeebled soldiers, even if successful in the first onslaught,
could count on no effective support, for Longstreet's corps was in even
worse condition than his own.Nevertheless, on the morning of Sunday, the
9th, the attempt was made.Gordon was fighting his corps, as he said, "to
a frazzle," when Lee came at last to a realizing sense of the futility of
it all and ordered a truce.A meeting with Grant was soon arranged on the
basis of the letters already exchanged.The conference of the two
world-famous commanders took place at Appomattox, a small settlement with
only one street, but to be made historic by this meeting.Lee was awaiting
Grant's arrival at the house of Wilmer McLean.It was here, surrounded by
staff-officers, that the terms were written by Grant for the final
surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.The terms, and their
acceptance, were embodied in the following letters, written and signed in
the famous "brick house" on that memorable Sunday:

    APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the
    8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of
    Northern Virginia on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the
    officers and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an
    officer to be designated by me, the other to be retained by such
    officer or officers as you may designate.The officers to give their
    individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the
    United States until properly exchanged; and each company or regimental
    commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands.The
    arms, artillery, and public property to be parked and stacked, and
    turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them.This will
    not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor their private horses or
    baggage.This done, each officer and man will be allowed to return to
    his home, not to be disturbed by the United States authority so long
    as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may
    reside.U. S. GRANT, _Lieutenant-General_.HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: I have received your letter of this date containing the terms
    of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.As they are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter
    of the 8th instant, they are accepted.I will proceed to designate the
    proper officers to carry the stipulation into effect.R. E. LEE, _General_.Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant.When Federal officers were seen galloping toward the Union lines from
Appomattox Court House it was quickly surmised that Lee had surrendered.Cheer after cheer was sent up by the long lines throughout their entire
length; caps and tattered colors were waved in the air.Officers and men
alike joined in the enthusiastic outburst.It was glad tidings, indeed, to
these men, who had fought and hoped and suffered through the long bloody
years.When Grant returned to his headquarters and heard salutes being fired he
ordered it stopped at once, saying, "The war is over; the rebels are our
countrymen again; and the best sign of rejoicing after the victory will be
to abstain from all demonstration in the field."Details of the surrender were arranged on the next day by staff-officers
of the respective armies.The parole officers were instructed by General
Grant to permit the Confederate soldiers to retain their own horses--a
concession that was most welcome to many of the men, who had with them
animals brought from the home farm early in the war.There were only twenty-eight thousand men to be paroled, and of these
fewer than one-third were actually bearing arms on the day of the
surrender.The Confederate losses of the last ten days of fighting
probably exceeded ten thousand.The Confederate supplies had been captured by Sheridan, and Lee's army was
almost at the point of starvation.An order from Grant caused the rations
of the Federal soldiers to be shared with the "Johnnies," and the
victorious "Yanks" were only too glad to tender such hospitality as was
within their power.These acts of kindness were slight in themselves, but
they helped immeasurably to restore good feeling and to associate for all
time with Appomattox the memory of reunion rather than of strife.The
things that were done there can never be the cause of shame to any
American.The noble and dignified bearing of the commanders was an example
to their armies and to the world that quickly had its effect in the
genuine reconciliation that followed.The scene between Lee and his devoted army was profoundly touching.General Long in his "Memoirs of Lee" says: "It is impossible to describe
the anguish of the troops when it was known that the surrender of the army
was inevitable.Of all their trials, this was the greatest and hardest to
endure."As Lee rode along the lines of the tried and faithful men who had
been with him at the Wilderness, at Spotsylvania, and at Cold Harbor, it
was not strange that those ragged, weather-beaten heroes were moved by
deep emotion and that tears streamed down their bronzed and scarred faces.Their general in broken accents admonished them to go to their homes and
be as brave citizens as they had been soldiers.Thus ended the greatest civil war in history, for soon after the fall of
the Confederate capital and the surrender of Lee's army, there followed in
quick succession the surrender of all the remaining Southern forces.While these stirring events were taking place in Virginia, Sherman, who
had swept up through the Carolinas with the same dramatic brilliancy that
marked his march to the sea, accomplishing most effective work against
Johnston, was at Goldsboro.When Johnston learned of the fall of Richmond
and Lee's surrender he knew the end had come and he soon arranged for the
surrender of his army on the terms agreed upon at Appomattox.In the first
week of May General "Dick" Taylor surrendered his command near Mobile, and
on the 10th of the same month, President Jefferson Davis, who had been for
nearly six weeks a fugitive, was overtaken and made a prisoner near
Irwinsville, Georgia.The Southern Confederacy was a thing of the past.[Illustration: MEN ABOUT TO WITNESS APPOMATTOX

No photographer was present at Appomattox, that supreme moment in our
national history, when Americans met for the last time as foes on the
field.Nothing but fanciful sketches exist of the scene inside the McLean
home.But here is a photograph that shows most of the Union officers
present at the conference.Nine of the twelve men standing above stood
also at the signing of Lee's surrender, a few days later.The scene is
City Point, in March, 1865.Grant is surrounded by a group of the officers
who had served him so faithfully.At the surrender, it was Colonel T. S.
Bowers (third from left) upon whom Grant called to make a copy of the
terms of surrender in ink.Colonel E. S. Parker, the full-blooded Indian
on Grant's staff, an excellent penman, wrote out the final copy.Nineteen
years later, General Horace Porter recorded with pride that he loaned
General Lee a pencil to make a correction in the terms.Colonels William
Duff and J. D. Webster, and General M. R. Patrick, are the three men who
were not present at the interview.All of the remaining officers were
formally presented to Lee.General Seth Williams had been Lee's adjutant
when the latter was superintendent at West Point some years before the
war.In the lower photograph General Grant stands between General Rawlins
and Colonel Bowers.The veins standing out on the back of his hand are
plainly visible.No one but he could have told how calmly the blood
coursed through them during the four tremendous years.[Illustration: GRANT BETWEEN RAWLINS AND BOWERS]

straggling Union soldiers.Its windows have long since been shattered by
shells from distant Federal mortars; one has even burst through the wall.But it was not till the night of April 2d, when the retreat of the
Confederate forces started, that the citizens began to leave their homes.At 9 o'clock in the morning General Grant, surrounded by his staff, rode
quietly into the city.At length they arrived
at a comfortable home standing back in a yard.There he dismounted and sat
for a while on the piazza.Soon a group of curious citizens gathered on
the sidewalk to gaze at the commander of the Yankee armies.But the Union
troops did not remain long in the deserted homes.Sheridan was already in
pursuit south of the Appomattox, and Grant, after a short conference with
Lincoln, rode to the west in the rear of the hastily marching troops.Bolingbroke Street and Petersburg soon returned to the ordinary
occupations of peace in an effort to repair the ravages of the historic

drove them on in the direction of Appomattox Court House, capturing many
prisoners, twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train, and a large

The sad significance of these photographs is all too apparent.Not only
the bank buildings were in ruins, but the financial system of the entire
South.All available capital had been consumed by the demands of the war,
and a system of paper currency had destroyed credit completely.Worse
still was the demoralization of all industry.Through large areas of the
South all mills and factories were reduced to ashes, and everywhere the
industrial system was turned topsy-turvy.Truly the problem that
confronted the South was stupendous.[Illustration: WRECK OF THE GALLEGO FLOUR MILLS

same devotion which manned these guns so bravely and prolonged the contest
as long as it was possible for human powers to endure, was now directed to
the new problems which the cessation of hostilities had provided.The
restored Union came with the years to possess for the South a significance
to be measured only by the thankfulness that the outcome had been what it
was and by the pride in the common traditions and common blood of the
whole American people.These captured guns are a memory therefore, not of
regret, but of recognition, gratitude, that the highest earthly tribunal

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On April 9, 1865, the very day of the surrender of Lee at Appomattox,
Lincoln, for the last time, went to the photographer's gallery.As he sits
in simple fashion sharpening his pencil, the man of sorrows cannot forget
the sense of weariness and pain that for four years has been unbroken.No
elation of triumph lights the features.One task is ended--the Nation is
saved.But another, scarcely less exacting, confronts him.The States
which lay "out of their proper practical relation to the Union," in his
own phrase, must be brought back into a proper practical relation.Only five days later the sad eyes reflected
upon this page closed forever upon scenes of earthly turmoil.Bereft of
Lincoln's heart and head, leaders attacked problems of reconstruction in
ways that proved unwise.As the mists of passion and prejudice cleared
away, both North and South came to feel that this patient, wise, and
sympathetic ruler was one of the few really great men in history, and that
he would live forever in the hearts of men made better by his presence
during those four years of storm.[Illustration: THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIERS--THE GRAND REVIEW

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.One of the proudest days of the nation--May 24, 1865--here lives again.The true greatness of the American people was not displayed till the close
of the war.The citizen from the walks of humble life had during the
contest become a veteran soldier, equal in courage and fighting capacity
to the best drilled infantry of Marlborough, Frederick the Great, or
Napoleon.But it remained to be seen whether he would return peacefully to
the occupations of peace."Would
nearly a million men," they asked, "one of the mightiest military
organizations ever trained in war, quietly lay aside this resistless power
and disappear into the unnoted walks of civil life?"The disbanded veterans
lent the effectiveness of military order and discipline to the industrial
and commercial development of the land they had come to love with an
increased devotion.The pictures are of Sherman's troops marching down
Pennsylvania Avenue.The horsemen in the lead are General Francis P. Blair
and his staff, and the infantry in flashing new uniforms are part of the
Seventeenth Corps in the Army of Tennessee.Little over a year before,
they had started with Sherman on his series of battles and flanking
marches in the struggle for Atlanta.They had taken a conspicuous and
important part in the battle of July 22d east of Atlanta, receiving and
finally repulsing attacks in both front and rear.They had marched with
Sherman to the sea and participated in the capture of Savannah.They had
joined in the campaign through the Carolinas, part of the time leading the
advance and tearing up many miles of railway track, and operating on the
extreme right after the battle of Bentonville.After the negotiations for
Johnston's surrender were completed in April, they set out on the march
for the last time with flying colors and martial music, to enter the
memorable review at Washington in May, here preserved.[Illustration: THE SAME SCENE, A FEW SECONDS LATER

me clan out here in th' middle av th' room.""Oi'll swear to it, Frankie--Oi'll swear on a stack av Boibles.""You dreamed it, Barney; that's what's the matter.""Nivver a drame, me b'y, fer Oi wasn't aslape at all, at all.""But you may have been asleep, for you say you were beginning to get
sleepy."Oi dunno about thot, Frankie.Oi'm incloined to belave th' Ould B'y's
around, so Oi am.""Nivver a bit will Oi troy to slape on thot couch again th' noight, me
b'y.Oi'll shtay roight here on th' flure.""Sleep where you like, but keep still.Frank was somewhat nettled by these frequent interruptions of his rest,
and he was more than tempted to give Barney cause to believe the hut was
really haunted, for he was an expert ventriloquist, and he could have
indulged in a great deal of sport with the Irish boy.But other things were soon to take up their attention.While they were
talking a strange humming arose on every side and seemed to fill the
entire hut.At first, it was like a swarm of bees, but it grew louder
and louder till it threatened to swell into a roar.Professor Scotch was nearly frightened out of his wits.he shrieked, making a wild dash for the
door, which he flung wide open.But the professor did not rush out of the cabin.Instead, he flung up
his hands, staggered backward, and nearly fell to the floor.he faintly gasped, clutching at empty air for
support.Frank sprang forward, catching and steadying the professor.Sure enough, on the dark surface of the water, directly in front of the
hut, lay the mysterious canoe.And now this singular craft was illuminated from stem to stern by a
soft, white light that showed its outlines plainly."Sint Patherick presarve us!""I am getting tired of being chased around by a canoe!"said Frank, in
disgust, as he hastily sought one of the rifles."Av yer do, our goose is cooked!"Frank threw a fresh cartridge into the rifle, and turned toward the open
door, his mind fully made up.And then, to the profound amazement of all three, seated in the canoe
there seemed to be an old man, with white hair and long, white beard.The soft, white light seemed to come from every part of his person, as
it came from the canoe.Frank Merriwell paused, with the rifle partly lifted."It's th' spook himsilf!"gasped Barney, covering his face with his
hands, and clinging to the professor."For mercy's sake, don't shoot,
Frank!Frank was startled and astonished, but he was determined not to lose his
nerve, no matter what happened.The man in the canoe seemed to be looking directly toward the cabin.He
slowly lifted one hand, and pointed away across the Everglades, at the
same time motioning with the other hand, as if for them to go in that
direction."I'll just send a bullet over his head, to see what he thinks of it,"
said Frank, softly, lifting the rifle.Canoe and man disappeared in the twinkling of an eye!The trio in the hut gasped and rubbed their eyes."An' now Oi suppose ye'll say it wur no ghost?"It was extremely dark beneath the shadow of the cypress trees, and not a
sign of the mysterious canoe could they see."It is evident he did not care to have me send a bullet whizzing past
his ears," laughed Frank, who did not seem in the least disturbed.demanded Professor Scotch, in a shaking
tone of voice.Frank's hand fell on the professor's arm, and the three listened
intently, hearing something that gave them no little surprise.From far away through the night came the sound of hoarse voices singing
a wild, doleful song."Pwhat the Ould Nick does thot mane?""Let's see if we can understand the words
they are singing."We sailed away from Gloucester Bay,
      And the wind was in the west, yo ho!And her cargo was some New England rum;
      Our grog it was made of the best, yo ho!""A sailor's song," decided Frank, "and those are sailors who are
singing.We are not alone in the Everglades.""They're all drunk," declared the professor."You can tell that by the
sound of their voices."They're a blamed soight betther than none, fer it's loikely they know
th' way out av this blissed swamp," said Barney."They may bub-bub-be pup-pup-pup-pirates!""What sticks me," said Frank, "is how a party of sailors ever made their
way in here, for we are miles upon miles from the coast."Are ye fer takin' a look at th' loikes av thim, Frankie?""I am not going near those ruffianly and bloodthirsty pirates.""Then you may stay here with the spooks, while Barney and I go."This was altogether too much for the professor, and, when he found they
really intended to go, he gave in.Frank loaded the rifles and the shotgun, and took along his bow and
arrows, even though Barney made sport of him for bothering with the
last.They slipped the canoe into the water, and, directed by Frank, the
professor succeeded in getting in without upsetting the frail affair."Oi hope we won't run inther the ghost," uttered the Irish boy."The sound of that singing comes from the direction in which the old man
seemed to point," said Frank.The singing continued, sometimes sinking to a low, droning sound,
sometimes rising to a wild wail that sounded weirdly over the marshland."Ready," said Frank, and the canoe slipped silently over the dark
surface of the water course.The singing ceased after a time, but they were still guided by the sound
of wrangling voices."This is tut-tut-terrible!"Suddenly the sound of a pistol shot came over the rushes, followed by a
feminine shriek of pain or terror!As soon as he
could recover, Frank asked:

"Did you hear that?""It sounded very much like the voice of a woman or girl," said Professor
Scotch, who was so amazed that he forgot for the moment that he was
scared."That's what it was," declared Frank; "and it means that our aid is
needed in that quarter at once.""There's no telling
what kind of a gang we may run into."grated Barney Mulloy, quivering with eagerness."There's a female in nade av hilp."directed Frank, giving utterance to his old maxim.The professor was too agitated to handle a paddle, so the task of
propelling the canoe fell to the boys, who sent it skimming over the
water, Frank watching out for snags.In a moment the water course swept round to the left, and they soon saw
the light of a fire gleaming through the rushes.The sounds of a conflict continued, telling them that the quarrel was
still on, and aiding them in forming their course.In a moment they came in full view of the camp-fire, by the light of
which they saw several struggling, swaying figures.Frank's keen eyes seemed to take in everything at one sweeping glance.Six men and a girl were revealed by the light of the fire.Five of the
men were engaged in a fierce battle, while the sixth was bound, in a
standing position, to the trunk of a tree.The girl, with her hands bound behind her back, was standing near the
man who was tied to the tree, and the firelight fell fairly on the faces
of man and girl.A low exclamation of the utmost astonishment broke from Frank's lips."It can't be--it is an impossibility!""Pwhat is it, me b'y?"That is Captain Justin Bellwood,
whose vessel was lost in the storm off Fardale coast!"An' th' girrul is----"

"Elsie Bellwood, his daughter!""Th' wan you saved from th' foire, Frankie?""Captain Bellwood
has a new vessel, and he would not be here."But how----"

"There has been some kind of trouble, and they are captives--that is
plain enough.Those men are sailors--Captain Bellwood's sailors!It's
likely there has been a mutiny."We must land while those ruffians are fighting.If
we can get ashore, we'll set the captain free, and I fancy we'll be able
to hold our own with those ruffians, desperate wretches though they
are.""Perhaps they will kill each other,
and then our part will be easy."Frank was not for waiting, but, at that moment, something happened that
caused him to change his plan immediately.The fighting ruffians were using knives in a deadly way, and one man,
bleeding from many wounds, fell exhausted to the ground.Another, who
seemed to be this one's comrade, tore himself from the other three,
leaped to the girl, caught her in his arms, and held her in front of
him, so that her body shielded his.Then, pointing a revolver over her
shoulder, he snarled:

"Come on, and I'll bore the three of ye!You can't shoot me, Gage,
unless you kill ther gal!"The youngest one of the party, a mere boy, but a fellow with the air of
a desperado, stepped to the front, saying swiftly:

"If you don't drop that girl, Jaggers, you'll leave your carcass in this
swamp!Frank clapped a hand over his mouth to keep from uttering a great shout
of amazement.The next moment he panted:

"This is fate!by the eternal skies, that is Leslie Gage,
my worst enemy at Fardale Academy, and the fellow who ran away to keep
from being expelled.It was reported that he had gone to sea.""Ye're roight, Frankie," agreed the no less excited Irish lad."It's
thot skunk, an' no mistake!""It is Leslie Gage," agreed the professor."He was ever a bad boy, but I
did not think he would come to this.""An' Oi always thought he would come to some bad ind.It wur thot
spalpane thot troied to run Frank through with a sharpened foil wan
toime whin they wur fencing.He had black murder in his hearrut thin,
an' it's not loikely th' whilp has grown inny betther since."The man with the girl laughed defiantly, retorting:

"You talk big, Gage, but it won't work with me.I hold the best hand
just at present, and you'll have to come to terms."You don't dare shoot," returned the young desperado, as he took still
another step toward the sailor.In a moment the man placed the muzzle of the revolver against the temple
of the helpless girl, fiercely declaring:

"If you come another inch, I'll blow her brains out!"I will fix him, or
my name is not Merriwell!"He drew an arrow from the quiver, and fitted the notch to the
bow-string.His nerves were steady, and he was determined.He waited
till the man had removed the muzzle of the weapon from the girl's
temple, and then he lifted the bow.They longed to check
Frank, but dared not speak for fear of causing him to waver and send the
arrow at the girl.The bow was bent, the line was taut, the arrow was drawn to the head,
and then----

Twang!The arrow sped through the air, but it was too dark for them to
follow its flight with their eyes.With their hearts in their mouths,
they awaited the result.Of a sudden, the ruffian uttered a cry of pain, released his hold on the
girl, and fell heavily to the ground.The firelight showed the arrow sticking in his shoulder.grunted a voice close beside the canoe."Very good shot for a
white boy.The trio turned in amazement and alarm, and, within three feet of them,
they saw a shadowy canoe that contained a shadowy figure.There was but
one person in the strange canoe, and he immediately added:

"There is no need to fear Socato, the Seminole, for he will not harm
you.He is the friend of all good white men."It was an Indian, a Seminole, belonging to the remnant of the once great
nation that peopled the Florida peninsula.Frank realized this in a
moment, and, knowing the Seminoles were harmless when well treated, felt
no further alarm.The Indian had paddled with the utmost silence to their side, while they
were watching what was taking place on shore.The arrow had produced consternation in the camp.The fellow who was
wounded tried to draw it from his shoulder, groaning:

"This is not a fair deal!Give me a fair show, and I'll fight you all!"The two canoes were beyond the circle of firelight, so they could not be
seen from the shore.Gage's two companions were overcome with terror."We've been attacked
by a band of savages!"Gage spoke a few words in a low tone, and then sprang over the prostrate
form of the man who had been stricken down by the arrow, grasped the
girl, and retreated into the darkness.His companions also scudded
swiftly beyond the firelight, leaving Captain Bellwood still bound to
the tree, while one man lay dead on the ground, and another had an arrow
in his shoulder.Close to Frank's ear the voice of Socato the Seminole sounded:

"Light bother them.They git in the dark and see us from the shore.gasped Professor Scotch, "I don't care to stay here,
and have them shoot at me!""Of course we will pay," hastily answered Frank."Can you aid us in
saving her?If you can, you shall be----"

"Socato save her.White man and two boys go back to cabin of Great White
Phantom.Stay there, and Socato come with the girl."Oi don't loike thot," declared Barney."Oi'd loike to take a
hand in th' rescue mesilf.""Socato can do better alone," asserted the Seminole.But Frank was not inclined to desert Elsie Bellwood in her hour of
trouble, and he said:

"Socato, you must take me with you.Professor, you and Barney go back to
the hut, and stay there till we come."The Indian hesitated, and then said:

"If white boy can shoot so well with the bow and arrow, he may not be in
the way.I will take him, if he can step from one canoe to the other
without upsetting either.""That's easy," said Frank, as he deliberately and safely accomplished
the feat."Well done, white boy," complimented the strange Indian."Pass me one of those rifles," requested Frank."White boy better leave rifle; take bow and arrows," advised Socato."Rifle make noise; bow and arrow make no noise."Return to the hut, Barney, and stay there
till we show up.""But th' spook----"

"Hang the spook!We'll know where to find you, if you go there.""The Great White Phantom will not harm those who offer him no harm,"
declared the Indian."I am not so afraid of spooks as I am of---- Jumping Jupiter!"There was a flash of fire from the darkness on shore, the report of a
gun, and a bullet whirred through the air, cutting the professor's
speech short, and causing him to duck down into the canoe."Those fellows have located us," said Frank, swiftly.Socato's paddle dropped without a sound into the water, and the canoe
slid away into the night.The professor and Barney lost no time in moving, and it was well they
did so, for, a few seconds later, another shot came from the shore, and
the bullet skipped along the water just where the canoes had been.Frank trusted everything to Socato, even though he had never seen or
heard of the Seminole before.Something about the voice of the Indian
convinced the boy that he was honest, for all that his darkness was such
that Frank could not see his face and did not know how he looked.The Indian sent the canoe through the water with a speed and silence
that was a revelation to Frank Merriwell.The paddle made no sound, and
it seemed that the prow of the canoe scarcely raised a ripple, for all
that they were gliding along so swiftly.whispered Frank, observing that they were leaving
the camp-fire astern."If I didn't, I shouldn't be here.Socato take him round to place where we can come up
behind bad white men.The light of the camp-fire died out, and then, a few moments later,
another camp-fire seemed to glow across a strip of low land.What party is camped there--friends of yours, Socato?"We left that fire behind us, Socato.""And we have come round by the water till it is before us again."This was true, but the darkness had been so intense that Frank did not
see how their course was changing."I see how you mean to come up behind them," said the boy."You are
going to land and cross to their camp."Soon the rushes closed in on either side, and the Indian sent the canoe
twisting in and out amid their tall stalks like a creeping panther.He
seemed to know every inch of the way, and followed it as well as if it
were broad noonday.Frank's admiration for the fellow grew with each moment, and he felt
that he could, indeed, trust Socato."If we save that girl and the old man, you shall be well paid for the
job," declared the boy, feeling that it was well to dangle a reward
before the Indian's mental vision."It is good," was the whispered retort.In a few moments they crept through the rushes till the canoe lay close
to a bank, and the Indian directed Frank to get out.The camp-fire could not be seen from that position, but the boy well
knew it was not far away.Taking his bow, with the quiver of arrows slung to his back, the lad
left the canoe, being followed immediately by the Seminole, who lifted
the prow of the frail craft out upon the bank, and then led the way.Passing round a thick mass of reeds, they soon reached a position where
they could see the camp-fire and the moving forms of the sailors.Just
as they reached this position, Leslie Gage was seen to dash up to the
fire and kick the burning brands in various directions."He has done that so that the firelight might not reveal them to us,"
thought Frank."They still believe us near, although they know not where
we are."Crouching and creeping, Socato led the way, and Frank followed closely,
wondering what scheme the Indian could have in his head, yet trusting
everything to his sagacity.In a short time they were near enough to hear the conversation of the
bewildered and alarmed sailors.The men were certain a band of savages
were close at hand, for they did not dream that the arrow which had
dropped Jaggers was fired by the hand of a white person."The sooner we get away from here, the better it will be for us,"
declared Leslie Gage."We'll have to get away in the boats," said a grizzled
villainous-looking, one-eyed old sailor, who was known as Ben Bowsprit."Fo' de Lawd's sake!"gasped the third sailor, who was a <DW64>, called
Black Tom; "how's we gwine to run right out dar whar de critter am dat
fired de arrer inter Jack Jaggers?""The 'critter' doesn't seem to be there any longer," assured Gage."Those two shots must have frightened him away.""That's right," agreed Bowsprit."This has been an unlucky stop fer us,
mates.Tomlinson is dead, an' Jaggers----"

"I ain't dead, but I'm bleedin', bleedin', bleedin'!"moaned the fellow
who had been hit by Frank's arrow."There's a big tear in my shoulder,
an' I'm afeared I've made my last cruise.""It serves you right," came harshly from the boy leader of the ruffianly
crew."Tomlinson attempted to set himself up as head of this crew--as
captain over me.All the time, you knew I was the leader
in every move we have made.""And a pretty pass you have led us to!""Where's the money you said the captain had stored away?Where's the
reward we'd receive for the captain alive and well?We turned mutineers
at your instigation, and what have we made of it?We've set the law
agin' us, an' here we are.The _Bonny Elsie_ has gone up in smoke----"

"Through the carelessness of a lot of drunken fools!"But for that, we wouldn't be here now,
hiding from officers of the law.""Well, here we are," growled Ben Bowsprit, "an' shiver my timbers if we
seem able to get out of this howlin' swamp!The more we try, the more we
seem ter git lost.""Fo' goodness, be yo' gwine to stan' roun' an' chin, an' chin, an'
chin?""The fire's out, and we can't be seen," spoke Gage, swiftly, in a low
tone.You two are to take the old man in one; I'll
take the girl in the other.""It's the gal you've cared fer all the time," cried Jaggers, madly."It
was for her you led us into this scrape."You can't make me shut up, Gage.""Well, you'll have a chance to talk to yourself and Tomlinson before
long."I saw you strike the
blow, and I'll swear to that, my hearty!""It's not likely you'll be given a chance to swear to it, Jaggers.I may
have killed him, but it was in self-defense.He was doing his best to
get his knife into me.""Yes, we was tryin' to finish you," admitted Jaggers."With you out of
the way, Tomlinson would have been cap'n, and I first mate.You've kept
your eyes on the gal all the time.I don't believe you thought the cap'n
had money at all.It was to get the gal you led us into this business.She'd snubbed you--said she despised you, and you made up your mind to
carry her off against her will.""If that was my game, you must confess I succeeded very well.But I
can't waste more time talking to you.Put Cap'n Bellwood in the larger, and look out for
him."Boy though he was, Gage had resolved
to become a leader of men, and he had succeeded.The girl, quite overcome, was prostrate at the feet of her father, who
was bound to the cypress tree.There was a look of pain and despair on the face of the old captain.His
heart bled as he looked down at his wretched daughter, and he groaned:

"Merciful Heaven!It were better that she
should die than remain in the power of that young villain!""What are you muttering about, old man?"coarsely demanded Gage, as he
bent to lift the girl."You seem to be muttering to yourself the greater
part of the time.""Do you
think you can escape the retribution that pursues all such dastardly
creatures as you?"I have found out that the goody-good people do
not always come out on top in this world.Besides that, it's too late
for me to turn back now.I started wrong at school, and I have been
going wrong ever since.It's natural for me; I can't help it.""If you harm her, may the wrath of Heaven fall on your head!"I will be very tender and considerate with her.He attempted to lift her to her feet, but she drew from him, shuddering
and screaming wildly:

"Don't touch me!""Now, don't be a little fool!""You make me sick with
your tantrums!But she screamed the louder, seeming to stand in the utmost terror of
him.With a savage exclamation, Gage tore off his coat and wrapped it about
the girl's head so that her cries were smothered."Perhaps that will keep you still a bit!"he snapped, catching her up in
his arms, and bearing her to the smaller boat, in which he carefully
placed her.As her hands were bound behind her, she could not
remove the coat from about her head, and she sat as he placed her, with
it enveloping her nearly to the waist.Somebody
take Tomlinson's weapons.He may need them when we
are gone.""Don't leave me here to die alone!"piteously pleaded the wounded
sailor."I'm pretty well gone now, but I don't want to be left here
alone!"Gage left the small boat for a moment, and approached the spot where the
pleading wretch lay."Jaggers," he said, "it's the fate you deserve.You agreed to stand by
me, but you went back on your oath, and tried to kill me.""And now you're going to leave me here to bleed to death or starve?"The tables are turned on you, my fine fellow.""Well, I'm sure you won't leave me."Jaggers flung up his hand, from which a spout of flame seemed to leap,
and the report of a pistol sounded over the marsh.Leslie Gage fell in a heap to the ground.Well, he is dead already, for I shot
him through the brain!""That's where you are mistaken, Jaggers," said the cool voice of the
boyish leader of the mutineers."I saw your move, saw the revolver, and
dropped in time to avoid the bullet."A snarl of baffled fury came from the lips of the wounded sailor."See if you can dodge this
bullet!"He would have fired again, but Gage leaped forward in the darkness,
kicked swiftly and accurately, and sent the revolver spinning from the
man's hand."I did mean to have
you taken away, and I was talking to torment you.Now you will stay
here--and die like a dog!"He turned from Jaggers, and hurried back to the boat, in which that
muffled figure silently sat.Captain Bellwood had been released from the tree, and marched to the
other boat, in which he now sat, bound and helpless.They pushed off, settled into their seats, and began rowing.Gage was not long in following, but he wondered at the silence of the
girl who sat in the stern.It could not be that she had fainted, for she
remained in an upright position."Any way to get out of this," was the answer."We will find another
place to camp, but I want to get away from this spot."Not a sound came from beneath the muffled coat."It must be close," thought Gage."I wonder if she can breathe all
right.At last, finding he could keep up with his companions without trouble,
and knowing he would have very little difficulty in overtaking them,
Gage drew in his oars and slipped back toward the muffled figure in the
stern."You must not think too hard of me, Miss Bellwood," he said, pleadingly.I love you far too much for that,
Elsie."He could have sworn that the sound which came from the muffling folds of
the coat was like a smothered laugh, but he knew she was not laughing at
him."I have been wicked and desperate," he went on; "but I was driven to the
life I have led.When I shipped on
your father's vessel it was because I had seen you and knew you were to
be along on the cruise.I loved you at first sight, and I vowed that I
would reform and do better if you loved me in return, Elsie."He was speaking swiftly in a low tone, and his voice betrayed his
earnestness.He passed an arm around the muffled figure, feeling it
quiver within his grasp, and then he continued:

"You did not take kindly to me, but I persisted.Then you repulsed
me--told me you despised me, and that made me desperate.I swore I would
have you, Elsie.Then came the mutiny and the burning of the vessel.Now
we are here, and you are with me.Elsie, you know not how I love you!I
have become an outcast, an outlaw--all for your sake!It must be that he was beginning to break down that icy barrier.She
realized her position, and she would be reasonable."Do not scream, Elsie--do not draw away, darling.Say that you will love
me a little--just a little!"He pulled the coat away, and something came out of the folds and touched
cold and chilling against his forehead.commanded a voice that was full of chuckling laughter."If
you chirp, I'll have to blow the roof of your head off, Gage!"Leslie Gage caught his breath and nearly collapsed into the bottom of
the boat.Indeed, he would have fallen had not a strong hand fastened on
his collar and held him."I don't want to shoot you, Gage," whispered the cool voice."I don't
feel like that, even though you did attempt to take my life once or
twice in the past.You have made me very good natured within the past
few moments.How gently you murmured, 'Do not draw
away, darling; say that you love me a little--just a little!'Really, Gage, you gave me such amusement that I am more than
satisfied with this little adventure.""Still, I can't
place you.""Indeed, you are forgetful, Gage.But it is rather dark, and I don't
suppose you expected to see me here."And you are--Frank Merriwell!"Gage would have shouted the name in his amazement, but Frank's fingers
suddenly closed on the fellow's throat and held back the sound in a
great measure."Now you have guessed it," chuckled Frank.I can forgive you
for the past since you have provided me with so much amusement to-night.How you urged me to learn to love you!But that's too much, Gage; I can
never learn to do that."Leslie ground his teeth, but he was still overcome with unutterable
amazement and wonder.That Frank Merriwell, whom he hated, should appear
there at night in the wilds of the Florida Everglades was like a
miracle.Had some magic of that wild and
dreary region changed her into Frank Merriwell?Little wonder that Gage was dazed and helpless."How in the name of the Evil One did you come here?"he finally asked,
recovering slightly from his stupor.It was the same old merry, boyish laugh
that Gage had heard so often at Fardale, and it filled him with intense
anger, as it had in the days of old."I know you did not expect to see me," murmured Frank, still laughing."I assure you that the Evil One had nothing to do with my appearance
here."I left her in the boat a few moments."I will let you speculate over that question for a while, my fine
fellow.In the meantime, I fancy it will be a good idea to tie you up so
you will not make any trouble.Remember I have a revolver handy, and I
promise that I'll use it if you kick up a row."At this moment, one of the sailors in the other boat called:

"Hello, there, Mr.Gage was tempted to shout for help, but the muzzle of the cold weapon
that touched his forehead froze his tongue to silence.Ben Bowsprit was growing impatient and wondering why Leslie did not
answer.It had occurred to the old tar that it was possible the boy had
deserted them.The voice of Black Tom was heard to say:

"He oughter be right near by us, Ben.'Smighty strange dat feller don'
seem to answer nohow.""We'll pull back, my hearty, and
take a look for our gay cap'n."They were coming back, and Gage was still unbound, although a captive in
Frank Merriwell's clutch.There would not be enough time to bind Gage and
get away.Something must be done to prevent the two sailors from turning
about and rowing back."Gage," whispered Frank, swiftly, "you must answer them.Say, it's all
right, boys; I'm coming right along."Gage hesitated, the longing to shout for help again grasping him.hissed Frank, and the muzzle of the revolver seemed
to bore into Gage's forehead, as if the bullet longed to seek his brain.With a mental curse on the black luck, Gage uttered the words as his
captor had ordered, although they seemed to come chokingly from his
throat."Well, what are ye doing back there so long?""Tell them you're making love," chuckled Frank, who seemed to be hugely
enjoying the affair, to the unspeakable rage of his captive."Ask them
if they don't intend to give you a show at all."Gage did as directed, causing Bowsprit to laugh hoarsely.cackled the old sailor, in the darkness."But
this is a poor time to spend in love-makin', cap'n.Wait till we git
settled down ag'in.Tom an' me'll agree not ter watch ye.""Say, all right; go on," instructed Frank, and Gage did so.In a few seconds, the sound of oars were heard, indicating that the
sailors were obeying instructions.At that moment, while Frank was listening to this sound, Gage believed
his opportunity had arrived, and, being utterly desperate, the young
rascal knocked aside Frank's hand, gave a wild shout, leaped to his
feet, and plunged headlong into the water.It was done swiftly--too swiftly for Frank to shoot, if he had intended
such a thing.But Frank Merriwell had no desire to shoot his former
schoolmate, even though Leslie Gage had become a hardened and desperate
criminal, and so, having broken away, the youthful leader of the
mutineers stood in no danger of being harmed.Frank and Socato had been close at hand when Gage placed Elsie Bellwood
in the boat, and barely was the girl left alone before she was removed
by the Seminole, in whose arms she lay limp and unconscious, having
swooned at last.Then it was that a desire to capture Gage and a wild longing to give the
fellow a paralyzing surprise seized upon Frank."Socato," he whispered, "I am going to trust you to take that girl to
the hut where my friends are to be found.Remember that you shall be
well paid; I give you my word of honor as to that."Have a little racket on my own hook," was the reply."If I lose my
bearings and can't find the hut, I will fire five shots into the air
from my revolver.Have one of my friends answer in a similar manner."Frank took the coat; stepped into the boat, watched till Gage was
approaching, and then muffled his head, sitting in the place where Elsie
had been left.In the meantime, the Seminole was bearing the girl swiftly and silently
away.Thus it came about that Gage made love to Frank Merriwell, instead of
the fair captive he believed was muffled by the coat.When Gage plunged into the water, the small boat rocked and came near
upsetting, but did not go over.But the fellow's cry and the splash had brought the sailors to a halt,
and they soon called back:

"What's the matter?"I rather fancy it will be a good plan to make myself scarce in this
particular locality," muttered Frank.Gage swam under water for some distance, and then, coming to the
surface, he shouted to the men in the leading boat:

"Bowsprit, Black Tom, help!There is an enemy here,
but he is alone!"You will have a fine time
catching me.You have given me great amusement, Gage.I assure you that
I have been highly entertained by your company, and hereafter I shall
consider you an adept in the gentle art of making love."fiercely shouted Gage from the water."You are having your turn
now, but mine will soon come!""I have heard you talk like that before, Gage.It does not seem that you
have yet learned 'the way of the transgressor is hard.'""You'll learn better than to meddle with me!I have longed to meet you
again, Frank Merriwell, and I tell you now that one of us will not leave
this swamp alive!""This is not the first time you have made a promise that you were not
able to keep.Before I leave you, I have this to say: If Captain
Bellwood is harmed in the least, if he is not set at liberty with very
little delay, I'll never rest till you have received the punishment
which your crimes merit."Frank could hear the sailors rowing back, and he felt for the oars,
having no doubt that he would be able to escape them with ease, aided by
the darkness.When Gage stopped rowing to make love to the supposed Elsie he had left
the oars in the rowlocks, drawing them in and laying them across the
boat.In the violent rocking of the boat when the fellow leaped
overboard one of the oars had been lost.Frank was left with a single oar, and his enemies were bearing down upon
him with great swiftness."I wonder if there's a chance to scull this boat?"he coolly speculated,
as he hastened to the stern and made a swift examination.To his satisfaction and relief, he found there was, and the remaining
oar was quickly put to use.Even then Frank felt confident that he would be able to avoid his
enemies in the darkness that lay deep and dense upon the great swamp.He
could hear them rowing, and he managed to skull the light boat along
without making much noise.He did not mind that Gage had escaped; in fact, he was relieved to get
rid of the fellow, although it had been his intention to hold him as
hostage for Captain Bellwood.It was the desire for adventure that had led Frank into the affair, and,
now that it was over so far as surprising Gage was concerned, he was
satisfied to get away quietly.He could hear the sailors calling Gage, who answered from the water, and
he knew they would stop to pick the fellow up, which would give our hero
a still better show of getting away.All this took place, and Frank was so well hidden by the darkness that
there was not one chance in a thousand of being troubled by the
ruffianly crew when another astonishing thing happened.From a point amid the tall rushes a powerful white light gleamed out and
fell full and fair upon the small boat and its single occupant,
revealing Frank as plainly as if by the glare of midday sunlight."What is the meaning of this,
I would like to know?"He was so astonished that he nearly dropped the oar.The sailors were astonished, but the light showed them distinctly, and
Gage snarled."Give me your pistol, Bowsprit!He snatched the weapon from the old tar's hand, took hasty aim, and
fired.Frank Merriwell was seen to fling up his arms and fall heavily into the
bottom of the boat!grated the triumphant young rascal, flourishing the revolver.The mysterious light vanished in the twinkling of an eye, but it had
shone long enough for Gage to do his dastardly work.The sailors were alarmed by the light, and wished to row away; but Gage
raved at them, ordering them to pull down toward the spot where the
other boat lay.After a time, the men recovered enough to do as directed, and the
smaller boat was soon found, rocking lightly on the surface.Running alongside, Gage reached over into the small boat, and his hand
found the boy who was stretched in the bottom.cried the young rascal, gleefully."I'll bet anything I
put the bullet straight through his heart!"And then, as if his own words had brought a sense of it all to him, he
suddenly shuddered with horror, faintly muttering:

"That was murder!"The horror grew upon him rapidly, and he began to wonder that he had
felt delight when he saw Frank Merriwell fall.The shooting had been the
impulse of the moment, and, now that it was done and he realized what it
meant, he would have given much to recall that bullet."I swore that one of us should not leave this
swamp alive, and my oath will not be broken.I hated Frank Merriwell the
first time I saw him, and I have hated him ever since.Now he is out of
my way, and he will never cross my path again."There was a slight stir in the small boat, followed by something like a
gasping moan."He don't seem to be dead yet, cap'n," said Ben Bowsprit."I guess your
aim wasn't as good as you thought.""Oh, I don't think he'll recover very fast," said the youthful rascal,
harshly.He rose and stepped over into the smaller boat."I want to take a look at the chap."You'll find I'm not dead yet!"returned a weak voice, and Frank
Merriwell sat up and grappled with Gage.A snarl of fury came from the lips of the boy desperado."You'll have to fight before you finish me!"But Merriwell seemed weak, and Gage did not find it difficult to handle
the lad at whom he had shot.He forced Frank down into the bottom of the
boat, and then called to his companions:

"Give me some of that line.A piece of rope was handed to him, and Black Tom stepped into the boat
to aid him.Between them, they succeeded in making Frank fast, for the
boy's struggles were weak, at best."At Fardale Frank
Merriwell triumphed.He disgraced me, and I was forced to fly from the
school.""You disgraced yourself," declared the defiant captive."You cheated at
cards--you fleeced your schoolmates."Oh, yes, I was rather flip with the papers,
and I should not have been detected but for you, Merriwell.When I was
exposed, I knew I would be shunned by all the fellows in school, and so
I ran away.But I did not forget who brought the disgrace about, and I
knew we should meet some time, Merriwell.How you came here
I do not know, and why my bullet did not kill you is more than I can
understand.""It would have killed me but for a locket and picture in my pocket,"
returned Frank."It struck the locket, and that saved me; but the shock
robbed me of strength--it must have robbed me of consciousness for a
moment.""It would have been just as well for you if the locket had not stopped
the bullet," declared Gage, fiercely."By that I presume you mean that you intend to murder me anyway?""I have sworn that one of us shall never leave this swamp alive.""Go ahead, Gage," came coolly from the lips of the captive."Luck seems
to have turned your way.Make the most of it while you have an
opportunity.""We can't spend time in gabbing here," came nervously from Bowsprit."Yes," put in Black Tom; "fo' de Lawd's sake, le's get away before dat
light shine some mo'!""That's right," said the old tar."Some things happen in this swamp that
no human being can account for."Gage was ready enough to get away, and they were soon pulling onward
again, with Frank Merriwell, bound and helpless, in the bottom of the
smaller boat.For nearly an hour they rowed, and then they succeeded in finding some
dry, solid land where they could camp beneath the tall, black trees.They were so overcome with alarm that they did not venture to build a
fire, for all that Gage was shivering in his wet clothes.Leslie was still puzzling over Frank Merriwell's astonishing appearance,
and he tried to question Frank concerning it, but he could obtain but
little satisfaction from the boy he hated.Away to the west stretched the Everglades, while to the north and the
east lay the dismal cypress swamps.The party seemed quite alone in the heart of the desolate region.Leslie started out to explore the strip of elevated land upon which they
had passed the night, and he found it stretched back into the woods,
where lay great stagnant pools of water and where grew all kinds of
strange plants and vines.Gage had been from the camp about thirty minutes when he came running
back, his face pale, and a fierce look in his eyes.cried Bowsprit, with an attempt at cheerfulness.What is it you have heard about, my hearty?""The serpent vine," answered Gage, wildly.I did not believe there was such a thing, but it tangled
my feet, it tried to twine about my legs, and I saw the little red
flowers opening and shutting like the lips of devils.""Fo' de Lawd's sake!de boss hab gone stark, starin' mad!"cried Black
Tom, staring at Leslie with bulging eyes."But I have thought of a way to
dispose of Frank Merriwell.Frank had listened to all this, and he noted that Gage actually seemed
like a maniac.Captain Bellwood, securely bound, was near Frank, to whom he now spoke:

"God pity you, my lad!He was bad enough before, but he seems to have
gone mad."Well, if that's to be the end of me, I'll have to take my medicine,"
came grimly from the lips of the undaunted boy captive.She is with friends of mine, and they will
fight for her as long as they are able to draw a breath."Now I care not if these wretches murder me!""I scarcely think they will murder you, captain.They have nothing in
particular against you; but Gage hates me most bitterly."snarled Leslie, who had overheard Frank's last words."I do hate you, and my hatred seems to have increased tenfold since last
night.I have been thinking--thinking how you have baffled me at every
turn whenever we have come together.I have decided that you are my evil
genius, and that I shall never have any luck as long as you live.One of us will not leave this swamp alive, and you
will be that one!""Go ahead with the funeral," said Frank, stoutly."If you have made up
your mind to murder me, I can't help myself; but one thing is
sure--you'll not hear me beg.""Wait till you know what your fate is to be.Boys, set his feet free,
and then follow me, with him between you."The cords which held Frank's feet were released, and he was lifted to a
standing position.Then he was marched along after Gage, who led the
way.Into the woods he was marched, and finally Gage came to a halt,
motioning for the others to stop.he cried, pointing; "there is the serpent vine!"On the ground before them, lay a mass of greenish vines, blossoming over
with a dark red flower.Harmless enough they looked, but, as Gage drew a
little nearer, they suddenly seemed to come to life, and they began
reaching toward his feet, twisting, squirming, undulating like a mass of
serpents.shouted Leslie--"there is the vine that feeds on flesh and
blood!See--see how it reached for my feet!It longs to grasp me, to
draw me into its folds, to twine about my body, my neck, to strangle
me!"The sailors shuddered and drew back, while Frank Merriwell's face was
very pale."It did fasten upon me," Gage continued."If I had not been ready and
quick with my knife, it would have drawn me into its deadly embrace.I
managed to cut myself free and escape."Then he turned to Frank, and the dancing light in his eyes was not a
light of sanity."Merriwell," he said, "the serpent vine will end your life, and you'll
never bother me any more!"He leaped forward and clutched the helpless captive, screaming:

"Thus I keep my promise!"And he flung Frank headlong into the clutch of the writhing vine!With his hands bound behind his back, unable to help himself, Frank
reeled forward into the embrace of the deadly vine, each branch of which
was twisting, curling, squirming like the arms of an octopus.He nearly plunged forward upon his face, but managed to recover and keep
on his feet.He felt the vine whip about his legs and fasten there tenaciously, felt
it twist and twine and crawl like a mass of serpents, and he knew he was
in the grasp of the frightful plant which till that hour he had ever
believed a creation of some romancer's feverish fancy.A great horror seemed to come upon him and benumb
his body and his senses.He could feel the horrid vines climbing and coiling about him, and he
was helpless to struggle and tear them away.He knew they were mounting
to his neck, where they would curl about his throat and choke the breath
of life from his body.It was a fearful fate--a terrible death.And there seemed no possible
way of escaping.Higher and higher climbed the vine, swaying and squirming, the blood-red
flowers opening and closing like lips of a vampire that thirsted for his
blood.A look of horror was frozen on Frank's face.His eyes bulged from his
head, and his lips were drawn back from his teeth.He did not cry out,
he did not seem to breathe, but he appeared to be turned to stone in the
grasp of the deadly plant.It was a dreadful sight, and the two sailors, rough and wicked men
though they were, were overcome by the spectacle.Shuddering and
gasping, they turned away.For the first time, Gage seemed to fully realize what he had done.He
covered his eyes with his hand and staggered backward, uttering a low,
groaning sound.Merriwell's staring eyes seemed fastened straight upon him with that
fearful stare, and the thought flashed through the mind of the wretched
boy that he should never forget those eyes."They will haunt me as long as I live!"Already he was seized by the pangs of remorse.Once more he looked at Frank, and once more those staring eyes turned
his blood to ice water.Then, uttering shriek after shriek, Gage turned and fled through the
swamp, plunging through marshy places and jungles, falling, scrambling
up, leaping, staggering, gasping for breath, feeling those staring eyes
at his back, feeling that they would pursue him to his doom.Scarcely less agitated and overcome, Bowsprit and the <DW64> followed,
and Frank Merriwell was abandoned to his fate.Frank longed for the use of his hands to tear away those fiendish vines.It was a horrible thing to stand and let them creep up, up, up, till
they encircled his throat and strangled him to death.Through his mind flashed a picture of himself as he would stand there
with the vines drawing tighter and tighter about his throat and his face
growing blacker and blacker, his tongue hanging out, his eyes starting
from their sockets.He came near shrieking for help, but the thought that the cry must reach
the ears of Leslie Gage kept it back, enabled him to choke it down.He had declared that Gage should not hear him beg for mercy or aid.Not
even the serpent vine and all its horrors could make him forget that
vow.The little red flowers were getting nearer and nearer to his face, and
they were fluttering with eagerness.He felt a sucking, drawing,
stinging sensation on one of his wrists, and he believed one of those
fiendish vampire mouths had fastened there.He swayed his body, he tried to move his feet, but he seemed rooted to
the ground.He did not have the strength to drag himself from that fatal
spot and from the grasp of the vine.His senses were in a maze, and the whole
world was reeling and romping around him.The trees became a band of
giant demons, winking, blinking, grinning at him, flourishing their arms
in the air, and dancing gleefully on every side to the sound of wild
music that came from far away in the sky.Then a smaller demon darted out from amid the trees, rushed at him,
clutched him, slashed, slashed, slashed on every side of him, dragged at
his collar, and panted in his ear:

"White boy fight--try to git away!Was it a dream--was it an hallucination?He
tore at the clinging vines, he fought with all his remaining strength,
he struggled to get away from those clinging things.All the while that other figure was slashing and cutting with something
bright, while the vine writhed and hissed like serpents in agony.How it was accomplished Frank could never tell, but he felt himself
dragged free of the serpent vine, dragged beyond its deadly touch, and
he knew it was no dream that he was free!A black mist hung before his eyes, but he looked through it and faintly
murmured:

"Socato, you have saved me!""Yes, white boy," replied the voice of the Seminole, "I found you just
in time.A few moments more and you be a dead one.""That is true, Socato--that is true!I can never
pay you for what you have done!"In truth the Indian had appeared barely in time to rescue Frank from the
vine, and it had been a desperate and exhausting battle.In another
minute the vine would have accomplished its work."I hear white boy cry out, and I see him run from this way," explained
the Seminole.Sailor men follow, and then I
come to see what scare them so.You knew how to fight the vine--how to cut
it with your knife, and so you saved me.""We must git 'way from here soon as can," declared the Indian."Bad
white men may not come back, and they may come back.They may want to
see what has happen to white boy."Frank knew this was true, but for some time he was not able to get upon
his feet and walk.At length the Indian assisted him, and, leaning on
Socato's shoulder, he made his way along.Avoiding the place where the sailors were camped, the Seminole proceeded
directly to the spot where his canoe was hidden.Frank got in, and
Socato took the paddle, sending the light craft skimming over the water.Straight to the strange hut where Frank and his companions had stopped
the previous night they made their way.The sun was shining into the heart of the great Dismal Swamp, and Elsie
Bellwood was at the door to greet Frank Merriwell.Elsie held out both hands, and there was a welcome light in her eyes.It
seemed to Frank that she was far prettier than when he had last seen her
in Fardale."Frank, I am so glad to see you!"He caught her hands and held them, looking into her eyes.The color came
into her cheeks, and then she noted his rumpled appearance, saw that he
was very pale, and cried:

"What is it, Frank?Socato grunted in a knowing way, but said nothing."It is nothing, Miss Bellwood," assured the boy."I have been through a
little adventure, that's all.He felt her fingers trembling in his clasp, and an electric thrill ran
over him.He remembered that at their last parting she had said it were
far better they should never meet again; but fate had thrown them
together, and now--what?He longed to draw her to him, to kiss her, to tell her how happy he was
at finding her, but he restrained the impulse.Then the voice of Barney Mulloy called from within the hut:

"Phwat ye goin' to do me b'y--shtand out there th' rist av th' doay?Whoy don't yez come in, Oi dunno?""Come in, Frank--come in," cried Professor Scotch."We have been worried
to death over you.Thought you were lost in the Everglades, or had
fallen into the hands of the enemy.""Your second thought was correct," smiled Frank, as he entered the hut,
with Elsie at his side.shouted the Irish boy, in astonishment."Ye don't mane
to say thim spalpanes caught yez?""That's what they did, and they came near cooking me, too."Frank then related the adventures that had befallen him since he started
out on his own hook to give Leslie Gage a surprise.He told how Gage had
made love to him in the boat, and Barney shrieked with laughter.Then he
related what followed, and how his life had been saved by the locket he
carried, and the professor groaned with dismay.Following this, he
related his capture by Gage and how the young desperado flung him, with
his hands bound, into the clutch of the serpent vine.The narrative first amused and then thrilled his listeners.Finally they
were horrified and appalled by the peril through which he had passed."It's Satan's own scum thot Gage is!""Iver let
me get a crack at th' loike av him and see phwat will happen to th'
whilp!"Then Frank explained how he had been saved by Socato, and the Seminole
found himself the hero of the hour."Soc, ould b'y," cried Barney, "thot wur th' bist job ye iver did, an'
Oi'm proud av yez!Ye'll niver lose anything by thot thrick, ayther."roared the little professor, wiping his eyes.Then the Seminole had his hand shaken in a manner and with a heartiness
that astonished him greatly."That was nothing," he declared, "Socato hates the snake vine--fight it
any time.When all had been told and the party had recovered from the excitement
into which they had been thrown, Barney announced that breakfast was
waiting.Elsie, for all of her happiness at meeting Frank, was so troubled about
her father that she could eat very little.Socato ate hastily, and then announced that he would go out and see what
he could do about rescuing Captain Bellwood.Barney wished to go with the Seminole, but Socato declared that he could
do much better alone, and hurriedly departed.Then Frank did his best to cheer Elsie, telling her that everything was
sure to come out all right, as the Indian could be trusted to outwit the
desperadoes and rescue the captain.Seeing Frank and Elsie much together, Barney drew the professor aside,
and whispered:

"It's a bit av a walk we'd better take in th' open air, Oi think.""But I don't need a walk," protested the little man."Yis ye do, profissor," declared the Irish boy, soberly."A man av your
studious habits nivver takes ixercoise enough.""But I do not care to expose myself outdoors.""Phwat's th' matther wid out dures, Oi dunno?""There's danger that Gage and his gang will appear."We can get back here aheed av thim, fer we won't go
fur enough to be cut off.""Then the exercise will not be beneficial, and I will remain here.""Profissor, yer head is a bit thick.Can't ye take a hint, ur is it a
kick ye nade, Oi dunno?""Young man, be careful what kind of language you use to me!""Oi'm spakin' United States, profissor; no Irishmon wauld iver spake
English av he could hilp it.""But such talk of thick heads and kicks--to me, sir, to me!""Well, Oi don't want to give yez a kick, but ye nade it.Ye can't see
thot it's alone a bit Frank an' th' litthle girrul would loike to be."did ye iver think ye'd loike to be alone wid a pretty swate
girrul, profissor?Come on, now, before Oi pick ye up an' lug ye out."So Barney finally induced the professor to leave the hut, but the little
man remained close at hand, ready to bolt in through the wide open door
the instant there was the least sign of danger.Left to themselves, Frank and Elsie chatted, talking over many things of
mutual interest.They sat very near together, and more and more Frank
felt the magnetism of the girl's winning ways and tender eyes.He drew
nearer and nearer, and, finally, although neither knew how it happened,
their hands met, their fingers interlocked, and then he was saying
swiftly, earnestly:

"Elsie, you cannot know how often I have thought of you since you left
me at Fardale.There was something wrong about that parting, Elsie, for
you refused to let me know where you were going, refused to write to me,
expressed a wish that we might never meet again."Her head was bowed, and her cheeks were very
pale."All the while," she softly said, "away down in my heart was a hope I
could not kill--a hope that we might meet again some day, Frank.""When we have to part again,
Elsie, you will not leave me as you did before?She was looking straight into his eyes now, her face was near his, and
the temptation was too great for his impulsive nature to resist.In a
moment his arm was about her neck, and he had kissed her.She quickly released herself from his hold and sprang to her feet, the
warm blood flushing her cheeks."We cannot always be right," she admitted; "but we should be right when
we can.Frank, Inza Burrage befriended me.She thinks more of you than
any one else in the wide world.He lifted his hand to a round hole in his coat where a bullet from
Leslie Gage's revolver had cut through, and beneath it he felt the
ruined and shattered locket that held Inza's picture.The forenoon passed, and the afternoon was well advanced, but still
Socato the Seminole did not return.But late in the afternoon a boat and a number of canoes appeared.In the
boat was Leslie Gage and the two sailors, Black Tom and Bowsprit."Phwat th'
dickens does this mane, Oi dunno?""It means trouble," said Frank, quickly."Have the rifles ready, and be
prepared for hot work.""Those must be Seminoles," said Frank."It is scarcely likely that they
are very dangerous."The boat containing the three white persons ran boldly up to the shore,
and Leslie Gage landed.Advancing a short distance toward the hut, the
door of which was securely closed, he cried:

"Hello in there!""Talk with him, Barney," Frank swiftly directed."The fellow does not
know I am alive, and I do not wish him to know it just now."So Barney returned:

"Hello, yersilf, an' see how ye loike it.""You people are in a bad trap," declared Gage, with a threatening air."Look," and he motioned toward the water, where the canoes containing
the Indians were lying, "these are my backers.There are twenty of them,
and I have but to say the word to have them attack this hut and tear it
to the ground.""Well, Oi dunno about thot," coolly retorted the Irish lad."We moight
have something to say in thot case.It's arrumed we are, an' we know how
to use our goons, me foine birrud.""If you were to fire a shot at one of these Indians it would mean the
death of you all."Well, we are arrumed with Winchester repeaters, an' it
moight make the death av thim all av we began shootin'.""They do not look very dangerous," said Frank."I'll wager something
Gage has hired the fellows to come here and make a show in order to
scare us into submitting.The chances are the Indians will not fight at
all.""You're not fools," said Gage, "and you will not do anything that means
the same as signing your death warrant.If you will come to reason,
we'll have no trouble.We want that girl, Miss Bellwood, and we will
have her.If you do not----"

He stopped suddenly, for there was a great shouting from the Indians.they cried, in tones that betokened the
greatest terror.Then they took to flight, paddling as if their very lives depended on
it.At the same time, the mysterious white canoe, still apparently without
an occupant, was seen coming swiftly toward them, gliding lightly over
the water in a most unaccountable manner.Exclamations of astonishment broke from the two sailors, and Leslie Gage
stared at the singular craft in profound astonishment.When the attention of the crowd was on the remarkable sight, Frank
unfastened the door and before Gage was aware of it, our hero was right
upon him.Frank shouted, pointing a revolver at the
fellow.Gage saw the boy he believed he had destroyed, uttered a wild shriek,
threw up his hands, and fell in a senseless heap to the ground.Frank swiftly lifted the fellow, and then ran into the cabin with him,
placing him on the couch.In fact, they seemed almost as badly
scared as the Indians, and they got away in their boat, rowing as if for
their very lives, soon passing from sight.exclaimed Barney Mulloy; "this is phwat Oi call a
ragion av wonders.It's ivery doay and almost ivery hour something
happens to astonish ye."Gage was made secure, so he could not get away when he recovered from
the swoon into which he seemed to have fallen.A short time after, Socato was seen returning, but he was alone in his
canoe."He has not found my father--my poor father!""Let's hear what he has to say."The bad white men leave their captive alone," said Socato, "and I
should have set him free, but the great white phantom came, and then the
white captive disappeared."Whom do you mean by the great white phantom?""The one who owns the canoe that goes alone--the one who built this
house and lives here sometimes.My people say he is
a phantom, for he can appear and disappear as he likes, and he commands
the powers of light and darkness.Socato knew that the bad white man had
hired a hunting party of my people to come here and appear before the
house to frighten you, but he knew you would not be frightened, and the
bad men could not get my people to aid them in a fight.Socato also knew
that the great white phantom sent his canoe to scare my people away, but
he does not know what the great white phantom has done with the man who
was a prisoner.""Well, it is possible the great white phantom will explain a few things
we do not understand," said Frank, "for here he comes in his canoe.""And father--my father is with him in the canoe!"screamed Elsie
Bellwood, in delight.The white canoe was approaching, still gliding noiselessly
over the water, without any apparent power of propulsion, and in it were
seated two men.One had a long white beard and a profusion of white
hair.He was dressed entirely in white, and sat in the stern of the
canoe.The other was Captain Justin Bellwood, quite unharmed, and
looking very much at his ease.The little party flocked to the shore to greet the captain, who waved
his hand and called reassuringly to Elsie.As soon as the canoe touched
and came to a rest, he stepped out and clasped his daughter in his arms,
saying, fervently:

"Heaven be thanked!we have come through many dangers, and we are free
at last!Neither of us has been harmed, and we will soon be out of this
fearful swamp."The man with the white hair and beard stepped ashore and stood regarding
the girl intently, paying no heed to the others.Captain Bellwood turned
to him, saying:

"William, this is my daughter, of whom I told you.Elsie, this is your
Uncle William, who disappeared many years ago, and has never been heard
from since till he set me free to-day, after I was abandoned by those
wretches who dragged us here.""And so I believed, but he still lives.Professor Scotch, I think we had
the pleasure of meeting in Fardale.Permit me to introduce you to
William Bellwood, one of the most celebrated electricians living
to-day."As he said this, Captain Bellwood made a swift motion which his brother
did not see.He touched his forehead, and the signal signified that
William Bellwood was not right in his mind.This the professor saw was
true when he shook hands with the man, for there was the light of
madness in the eyes of the hermit."My brother," continued Captain Bellwood, "has explained that he came
here to these wilds to continue his study of electricity alone and
undisturbed.He took means to keep other people from bothering him.This
canoe, which contains a lower compartment and a hidden propeller, driven
by electricity, was his invention.He has arrangements whereby he can
use a powerful search-light at night, and----"

"That search-light came near being the death of me," said Frank."He
turned it on me last night just in time to show me to my enemy.""He has many other contrivances," Captain Bellwood went on."He has
explained that, by means of electricity, he can make his canoe or
himself glow with a white light in the darkest night.""And he also states that he has wires connecting various batteries in
yonder hut, so that he can frighten away superstitious hunters who
otherwise might take possession of the hut and give him trouble.""Thot ixplains th' foire-allarum an' th' power
thot throwed me inther th' middle av th' flure!Oi nivver hearrud th'
bate av it!"At this moment, a series of wild shrieks came from the hut, startling
them all.Gage was still on the couch,
and he shrieked still louder when he saw Frank; an expression of the
greatest terror coming to his face.Then he began to rave incoherently, sometimes frothing at the mouth.Two days later a party of eight persons emerged from the wilds of the
great Dismal Swamp and reached a small settlement.They were Frank
Merriwell, Barney Mulloy, Professor Scotch, Leslie Gage, Captain
Bellwood and his brother William, Socato the Seminole, and last, but far
from least, Elsie Bellwood."He shall be given shelter and medical treatment," declared Frank; "and
I will see that all the bills are paid.""Thot's the only thing Oi have against ye, me b'y.Ye wur always letting
up on yer inemies at Fardale, an' ye shtill kape on doin' av it.""If I continue to do so, I shall have nothing to trouble my conscience."Frank did take care of Gage and see that he was given the best medical
aid that money could procure, and, as a result, the fellow was saved
from a madhouse, for he finally recovered.He seemed to appreciate the
mercy shown him by his enemy, for he wrote a letter to Frank that was
filled with entreaties for forgiveness and promised to try to lead a
different life in the future."That," said Frank, "is my reward for being merciful to an enemy."If Jack Jaggers did not perish in the Everglades, he disappeared.Ben
Bowsprit and Black Tom also vanished, and it is possible that they left
their bones in the great Dismal Swamp.William Bellwood, so long a hermit in the wilds of Florida, seemed glad
to leave that region.Leaving their friends in Florida, Frank, Barney and the professor next
moved northward toward Tennessee, Frank wishing to see some of the
battlegrounds of the Civil War.The boys planned a brief tour afoot and were soon on their way among the
Great Smoky Mountains.Professor Scotch had no heart for a "tour afoot" through the mountains,
and so he had stopped at Knoxville, where the boys were to join him
again in two or three weeks, by the end of which period he was quite
sure they would have enough of tramping.Frank and Barney were making the journey from Gibson's Gap to Cranston's
Cove, which was said to be a distance of twelve miles, but they were
willing to admit that those mountain miles were most disgustingly long.They had paused to rest, midway in the afternoon, where the road curved
around a spur of the mountain.Below them opened a vista of valleys and
"coves," hemmed in by wild, turbulent-appearing masses of mountains,
some of which were barren and bleak, seamed with black chasms, above
which threateningly hung grimly beetling crags, and some of which were
robed in dense wildernesses of pine, veiling their faces, keeping them
thus forever a changeless mystery.From their eyrie position it seemed that they could toss a pebble into
Lost Creek, which wound through the valley below, meandered for miles
amid the ranges, tunneling an unknown channel beneath the rock-ribbed
mountains, and came out again--where?Both boys had been silent and awe-stricken, gazing wonderingly on the
impressive scene and thinking of their adventures in New Orleans and in
Florida, when a faint cry seemed to float upward from the depths of the
valley.They listened, and some moments passed in silence, save for the peeping
cry of a bird in a thicket near at hand.Oi belave it wur imagination, Frankie," said the Irish lad, at
last."I do not think so," declared Frank, with a shake of his head."It was a
human voice, and if we were to shout it might be---- There it is again!"There could be no doubt this time, for they both heard the cry
distinctly."It comes from below," said Frank, quickly."Roight, me lad," nodded Barney."Some wan is in difficulty down there,
and' it's mesilf thot don't moind givin' thim a lift."Getting a firm hold on a scrub bush, Frank leaned out over the verge and
looked down into the valley."Look, Barney--look down there amid those
rocks just below the little waterfall.""She has seen us, and is signaling for us to come down.""Instanter, as they say out West."The boys were soon hurrying down the mountain road, a bend of which
quickly carried them beyond view of the person near the waterfall.It was nearly an hour later when Frank and Barney approached the little
waterfall, having left the road and followed the course of the stream.anxiously asked Barney, who was behind."Can't tell yet," was the reply."Will be able to see in a minute, and
then---- She is there, sure as fate!"In another moment they came out in full view of a girl of eighteen or
nineteen, who was standing facing the waterfall, her back toward a great
rock, a home-made fishing pole at her feet.The girl was dressed in homespun, the skirt being short and reaching
but a little below the knees, and a calico sunbonnet was thrust half off
her head.Frank paused, with a low exclamation of admiration, for the girl made a
most strikingly beautiful picture, and Frank had an eye for beauty.Nearly all the mountain girls the boys had seen were stolid and
flat-appearing, some were tall and lank, but this girl possessed a
figure that seemed perfect in every detail.Her hair was bright auburn, brilliant and rich in tint, the shade that
is highly esteemed in civilization, but is considered a defect by the
mountain folk.Frank thought it the most beautiful hair he had ever
seen.Her eyes were brown and luminous, and the color of health showed through
the tan upon her cheeks.Her parted lips showed white, even teeth, and
the mouth was most delicately shaped.gasped Barney, at Frank's shoulder."Phwat have we struck, Oi
dunno?"Then the girl cried, her voice full of impatience:

"You-uns has shorely been long enough in gittin' har!"Frank staggered a bit, for he had scarcely expected to hear the uncouth
mountain dialect from such lips as those but he quickly recovered,
lifted his hat with the greatest gallantry, and said:

"I assure you, miss, that we came as swiftly as we could."Ef you-uns had been maounting boys, you'd been har in
less'n half ther time.""I presume that is true; but, you see, we did not know the shortest way,
and we were not sure you wanted us.""Wal, what did you 'low I whooped at ye fur ef I didn't want ye?I
nighly split my throat a-hollerin' at ye before ye h'ard me at all."Frank was growing more and more dismayed, for he had never before met a
strange girl who was quite like this, and he knew not what to say."Now that we have arrived," he bowed, "we shall be happy to be of any
possible service to you.""Dunno ez I want ye now," she returned, with a toss of her head.gurgled Barney, at Frank's ear."It's a doaisy she is,
me b'y!"Frank resolved to take another tack, and so he advanced, saying boldly
and resolutely:

"Now that you have called us down here, I don't see how you are going to
get rid of us.You want something of us, and we'll not leave you till we
find out what it is."The girl did not appear in the least alarmed.Instead of that, she
laughed, and that laugh was like the ripple of falling water."Wal, now you're talkin'!"she cried, with something like a flash of
admiration."Mebbe you-uns has got some backbone arter all."I have not looked at mine for so long that I am not sure what condition
it is in, but I know I have one.""Then move this rock har that hez caught my foot an' holds it.That's
what I wanted o' you-uns."She lifted her skirt a bit, and, for the first time, they saw that her
ankle had been caught between two large rocks, where she was held fast."Kinder slomped in thar when I war fishin'," she explained, "an' ther
big rock dropped over thar an' cotched me fast when I tried ter pull
out.That war nigh two hour ago, 'cordin' ter ther sun.""And you have been standing like that ever since?"cried Frank, in
dismay."Lively, Barney--get hold here!we must have her
out of that in a hurry!""Thot's phwat we will, ur we'll turrun th' ould mountain over!"shouted
the Irish lad, as he flew to the aid of his friend.The girl looked surprised and pleased, and then she said:

"You-uns ain't goin' ter move that rock so easy, fer it's hefty.""But your ankle--it must have crushed your ankle."Ye see it couldn't pinch harder ef it tried, fer them rocks
ain't built so they kin git nigher together; but it's jest made a
reg'ler trap so I can't pull my foot out."It was no easy thing for the boys to get hold of the rock in a way to
exert their strength, but they finally succeeded, and then Frank gave
the word, and they strained to move it.It started reluctantly, as if
loath to give up its fair captive, but they moved it more and more, and
she was able to draw her foot out.Then, when she was free, they let go,
and the rock fell back with a grating crash against the other."You-uns have done purty fair fer boys," said the girl, with a saucy
twinkle in her brown eyes."S'pose I'll have ter thank ye, fer I mought
a stood har consider'bul longer ef 'tadn't bin fer ye.an' whar be ye goin'?"Frank introduced himself, and then presented Barney, after which he
explained how they happened to be in the Great Smoky Mountains.She watched him closely as he spoke, noting every expression, as if a
sudden suspicion had come upon her, and she was trying to settle a doubt
in her mind.When Frank had finished, the girl said:

"Never heard o' two boys from ther big cities 'way off yander comin' har
ter tromp through ther maountings jest fer ther fun o' seein' ther
scenery an' ther folks.I s'pose we're kinder curi's 'pearin' critters
ter city folks, an' you-uns may be har ter cotch one o' us an' put us in
a cage fer exhibition."She uttered the words in a way that brought a flush to Frank's cheeks,
and he hastened to protest, halting in confusion when he tried to speak
her name, which he did not know as yet.A ripple of sunshine seemed to break over her face, and she laughed
outright, swiftly saying:

"Don't you-uns mind me.I'm p'izen rough, but I don't mean half I say.I
kin see you is honest an' squar, though somebody else mought think by
yer way that ye warn't.My name's Kate Kenyon, an' I live down toward
ther cove.I don't feel like fishin' arter this, an' ef you-uns is goin'
that way, I'll go 'long with ye."She picked up her pole, hooked up the line, and prepared to accompany
them.They were pleased to have her as a companion.Indeed, Frank was more
than pleased, for he saw in this girl a singular character.Illiterate
though she seemed, she was pretty, vivacious, and so bright that it was
plain education and refinement would make her most fascinating and
brilliant.The boys did not get to Cranston's Cove that night, for Kate Kenyon
invited them to stop and take supper at her home, and they did so.Kate's home was much like the rough cabins of other mountain folks,
except that flowering vines had been trained to run up the sides and
over the door, while two large bushes were loaded with roses in front of
the house.Kate's mother was in the doorway as they approached.She was a tall,
angular woman, with a stolid, expressionless face."Har, mammy, is some fellers I brung ter see ye," said this girl.Merriwell, an' that un is Mr.The boys lifted their hats, and bowed to the woman as if she were a
society queen."What be you-uns doin' 'round these parts?"Frank explained, seeing a look of suspicion and distrust deepening in
her face as he spoke."An' what do you-uns want o'
me?""Your daughter invited us to call and take supper," said Frank, coolly."I ain't uster cookin' flip-flaps fer city chaps, an' I don't b'lieve
you kin eat the kind o' fodder we-uns is uster."The boys hastened to assure her that they would be delighted to eat the
plainest of food, and their eagerness brought a merry laugh from the
lips of the girl."You-uns is consid'ble amusin'," she said.I
asked 'em to come, mammy.It's no more'n fair pay fer what they done fer
me."Then she explained how she had been caught and held by the rocks, and
how the boys had seen her from the mountain road and come to her
rescue.The mother's face did not soften a bit as she listened, but, when Kate
had finished, she said:

"They're yore comp'ny.So the boys were asked into the cabin, and Kate herself prepared supper.It was a plain meal, but Frank noticed that everything looked neat and
clean about the house, and both lads relished the coarse food.Indeed,
Barney afterward declared that the corn bread was better than the finest
cake he had ever tasted.Frank was particularly happy at the table, and the merry stories he told
kept Kate laughing, and, once or twice, brought a grim smile to the face
of the woman.After supper they went out in front of the cabin, where they could look
up at the wild mass of mountains, the peaks of which were illumined by
the rays of the setting sun.Kenyon filled and lighted a cob pipe.She sat and puffed away,
staring straight ahead in a blank manner.Just how it happened Frank himself could not have told, but Barney fell
to talking to the woman in his whimsical way, while Frank and Kate
wandered away a short distance, and sat on some stones which had been
arranged as a bench in a little nook near Lost Creek.From this position
they could hear Barney's rich brogue and jolly laugh as he recounted
some amusing yarn, and, when the wind was right, a smell of the black
pipe would be wafted to them."Do you know," said Frank, "this spot is so wild and picturesque that it
fascinates me.I should like to stop here two or three days and rest.""Better not," said the girl, shortly."Wal, it mought not be healthy.""I wonder ef you air so ignerent, or be you jest makin' it?""Honestly and truly, I do not understand you.""Wal, I kinder 'low you-uns is all right, but thar's others might not
think so.S'pose you know what moonshine is?""Yes; it is illicitly distilled whiskey."Wal, ther revenues say thar's moonshine made round these
parts.They come round ev'ry little while to spy an' cotch ther folks
that makes it.""By revenues you mean the officers of the government?""Wal, they may be officers, but they're a difrrunt kind than Jock
Hawkins.""He's ther sheriff down to ther cove.Jock Hawkins knows better'n to
come snoopin' 'round, an' he's down on revenues ther same as ther rest
o' us is.""Then you do not like the revenue officers?"cried the girl, starting up, her eyes seeming to blaze in
the dusky twilight."I hate 'em wuss'n pizen!An' I've got good cause
fer hatin' 'em."The boy saw he had touched a tender spot, and he would have turned the
conversation in another channel, but she was started, and she went on
swiftly:

"What right has ther gover'ment to take away anybody's honest means o'
earnin' a livin'?What right has ther gover'ment to send spies up har
ter peek an' pry an' report on a man as is makin' a little moonshine ter
sell that he may be able ter git bread an' drink fer his fam'ly?What
right has ther gover'ment ter make outlaws an' crim'nals o' men as
wouldn't steal a cent that didn't b'long ter them if they was starvin'?"Frank knew well enough the feeling of most mountain folks toward the
revenue officers, and he knew it was a useless task to attempt to show
them where they were in the wrong."Yes, I has good right to hate ther revenues, an' I do!Didn't they
pester my pore old daddy fer makin' moonshine!Didn't they hunt him
through ther maountings fer weeks, an' keep him hidin' like a dog!An'
didn't they git him cornered at last in Bent Coin's old cabin, an' when
he refused ter come out an' surrender, an' kep' 'em off with his gun,
didn't they shoot him so he died three days arter in my arms!Wal, I've got good reason ter hate 'em!"Kate was wildly excited, although she held her voice down, as if she did
not wish her mother to hear what she was saying.Frank was sitting so
near that he felt her arm quivering against his."I has more than that to hate 'em fer!Whar is my brother Rufe, ther best boy that ever drored a breath?Ther
revenues come fer him, an' they got him.Thar war a trial, an' they
proved ez he'd been consarned in makin' moonshine.He war convicted, an'
he's servin' his time.Wal, thar's nuthin' I hate wuss on this
earth!""You have had hard luck," said Frank, by way of saying something."It's
lucky for us that we're not revenues.""Yer right thar," she nodded."I didn't know but ye war at first, but I
changed my mind later.""Wal, ye're young, an' you-uns both has honest faces."I don't suppose they have been able to check the making of
moonshine--that is, not to any extent?""He makes more whiskey in a week than all ther others in this region
afore him made in a month.""He must be smarter than the others before him.""Wal, he's not afeared o' ther revenues, an' he's a mystery to ther men
ez works fer him right along.""None o' them has seen his face, an' they don't know Who he is.They
ain't been able to find out.""Wal, Con Bean war shot through ther shoulder fer follerin' Muriel, an'
Bink Mower got it in ther leg fer ther same trick.""I rather admire this Muriel," laughed Frank."He may be in unlawful
business, but he seems to be a dandy.""He keeps five stills runnin' all ther time, an' he has a way o' gittin'
ther stuff out o' ther maountings an' disposin' of it.But I'm talkin'
too much, as Wade would say.""He's Wade Miller, a partic'lar friend o' our'n sence Rufe war tooken by
ther revenues.Wade has been good to mammy an' me."If I lived near, I might try to bother Wade
somewhat."It was now duskish, but he was so near that
he could see her eyes through the twilight."I dunno what you-uns means," she said, slowly, her voice falling."Wade
would be powerful bad to bother.He's ugly sometimes, an' he's jellus o'
me.""Wal, he's tryin' ter, but I don't jes' snuggle ter him ther way I might
ef I liked him right.Thar's something about him, ez I don't edzac'ly
like.""That makes it rather one-sided, and makes me think all the more that I
should try to bother him if I lived near.Do you know, Miss Kenyon, that
you are an exceptionally pretty girl?""Hair that would make you the envy of a society belle.It is the
handsomest hair I ever saw.""Now you're makin' fun o' me, an' I don't like that."She drew away as if offended, and he leaned toward her, eager to
convince her of his sincerity."Indeed, I am doing nothing of the sort," he protested."The moment I
saw you to-day I was struck by the beauty of your hair.But that is not
the only beautiful feature about you, Miss Kenyon.Your mouth is a
perfect Cupid's bow, and your teeth are like pearls, while you have a
figure that is graceful and exquisite.""Never nobody talked to me like that afore," she murmured."Round har
they jes' say, 'Kate, you'd be a rippin' good looker ef it warn't fer
that red hair o' yourn.'An' they've said it so much that I've come to
hate my hair wuss'n pizen."Her hand found his, and they were sitting very near together."I took to you up by ther fall ter-day," she went on, in a low tone."Now, don't you git skeered, fer I'm not goin' to be foolish, an' I know
I'm not book-learned an' refined, same ez your city gals.We kin be
friends, can't we?"Frank had begun to regret his openly expressed admiration, but now he
said:

"To be sure we can be friends, Miss Kenyon.""I am sure I shall esteem your friendship very highly.""Wall, partic'ler friends don't call each other miss an' mister.I'll
agree ter call you Frank, ef you'll call me Kate.""I am going away to-morrow," he thought.A fierce exclamation close at hand, the cracking of a twig, a heavy
step, and then a panther-like figure leaped out of the dusk, and flung
itself upon Frank.[Illustration: "Kate grasped the assailant by the collar, and with
astonishing strength, pulled him off the prostrate lad."(See page
218)]




CHAPTER XL.The attack was so sudden and fierce that the boy was hurled to the
ground before he could make a move to protect himself.A hand fastened on his throat, pinning him fast.The man's knee crushed
into his stomach, depriving him of breath.The man's other hand snatched
out something, and lifted it aloft.A knife was poised above Frank's heart, and in another moment the blade
would have been buried to the hilt in the lad's bosom.Without uttering a sound, Kate Kenyon grasped the wrist of the
murderous-minded man, gave it a wrench with all her strength, which was
not slight, and forced him to drop the knife."You don't murder anybody, Wade Miller!""I'll choke ther life outen him!"snarled the fellow, as he tried to
fasten both hands on Frank's throat.By this time the boy had recovered from the surprise and shock, and he
was ready to fight for his life.Kate grasped the assailant by the collar, and, with astonishing
strength, pulled him off the prostrate lad.In the twinkling of an eye, Frank came to his feet, and he was ready for
a new assault.Snarling and growling like a mad dog, the man scrambled up and lunged
toward the boy, trying to grasp him.Frank was a skillful boxer, and now his skill came into play, for he
dodged under the man's right arm, whirled like a cat, and struck the
fellow behind the ear.sounded the blow, sending the assailant staggering, and Frank
followed it up by leaping after him and striking him again, the second
blow having the force of the lad's strength and the weight of his body.It seemed that the man was literally knocked "spinning," and he did not
stop till he landed in the creek."Wal," exclaimed the girl, "I 'low you kin take keer o' yerself now!""I rather think so," came coolly from the boy."He caught me foul, and I
did not have a show at first."It was a case of jealousy, and he had aroused the worst
passions of the man who admired Kate Kenyon.Miller came scrambling and
snorting from the water, and Barney Mulloy rushed toward the spot,
crying:

"Pwhat's th' row, Frankie, me b'y?Do ye nade inny av me hilp?"So far, I am all right, thanks to Miss Kenyon."breathed the mountain maid, in sincere admiration."I didn't s'pose city chaps knowed how ter fight.""Some do," laughed Frank, keeping his eyes on Miller.panted the man, springing toward Frank, and then
halting suddenly, and throwing up his hand.Frank knew this well enough, and he was expecting just such a move, so
it happened that the words had scarcely left the girl's lips when the
revolver was sent flying from Wade Miller's hand.The boy had leaped forward, and, with one skillful kick, disarmed his
foe by knocking the weapon out of his hand.Miller seemed dazed for a moment, and then he started for Frank, once
more grinding his teeth."Oh, let me take a hand in this!"cried Barney Mulloy, who was eager for
a fight."Me blud is gittin' shtagnant.""Well, you have tried that trick twice, but I do not see that you have
succeeded to any great extent.""I'll hammer yer life out o' yer carcass with my bare hands!""Possibly that will not be such a very easy trick to do."The boy's coolness seemed to add to the fury of his assailant, and the
man made another rush, which was easily avoided by Frank, who struck
Miller a stinging blow."You'd better stop, Wade," advised the girl."He-uns is too much fer
you-uns, an' that's plain enough.""Oh, I'll show ye--I'll show ye!"There was no longer any reason in the man's head, and Frank saw that he
must subdue the fellow some way.Miller was determined to grapple with
the boy, and Frank felt that he would find the mountaineer had the
strength of an ox, for which reason he must keep clear of those grasping
hands.For some moments Frank had all he could do to avoid Miller, who seemed
to have grown stolid to the lad's blows.At last, Frank darted in,
caught the man behind, lifted him over one hip, and dashed him headlong
to the ground."Wal, that's the beatenest I ever saw!"cried Kate Kenyon, whose
admiration for Frank now knew no bounds."You-uns is jes' a terror!""Whoy, thot's fun fer Frankie," he declared.Miller groaned, and sat up, lifting his hands to his head, and looking
about him in a dazed way."Ye run ag'in' a fighter this time, Wade," said the girl."He done ye,
an' you-uns is ther bully o' these parts!""It was an accident," mumbled the man."I couldn't see ther critter
well, an' so he kinder got----"

"That won't go, Wade," half laughed the girl."He done you fa'r an'
squar', an' it's no us' ter squawk.""An' ye're laffin' 'bout it, be ye, Kate?"Better let him erlone, Wade.You-uns has made fool enough o' yerself.Ye tried ter kill me, an'----"

"What I saw made me do it!""He war makin' love ter ye,
Kate--an' you-uns liked it!""Wal, Wade Miller, what is that ter you-uns?""He has a right ter make love ter me ef he wants ter.""Oh, yes, he has a right, but his throat'll be slit before long, mark
what I say!""Ef anything o' that kind happens, Wade Miller, I'll know who done it,
an' I swa'r I'll never rest till I prove it agin' ye.""I don't keer, Kate," muttered the man, getting on his feet and standing
there sulkily before them."Ef I can't hev ye, I sw'ar no other critter
shall!"I've stood all I kin from you, an' from now on
I don't stan' no more.Arter this you-uns an' me-uns ain't even
friends."He fell back a step, as if he had been struck a blow, and then he
hoarsely returned:

"All right, Kate.I ain't ter be thrown
aside so easy.As fer them city chaps, ther maountings ain't big enough
ter hold them an' me.Wade Miller has some power, an' I wouldn't give a
snap for their lives.The Black Caps don't take ter strangers much, an'
they know them critters is hyar.I'm goin' now, but that don't need ter
mean that I'll stay away fer long."He turned, and, having picked up his revolver, strode away into the
darkness, quickly disappearing.Kate's trembling hand fell on Frank's arm, and she panted into his ear:

"You-uns must git out o' ther maountings quick as you kin, fer Wade
Miller means what he says, an' he'll kill ye ef you stay hyar!"Frank Merriwell's blood was aroused, and he did not feel like letting
Wade Miller drive him like a hunted dog from the mountains."By this time I should think you would have confidence in my ability to
take care of myself against this man Miller," he said, somewhat testily."Yo're ther best fighter I ever saw, but that won't'mount ter anything
agin' ther power Miller will set on yer.He's pop-ler, is Wade Miller,
an' he'll have ther hull maountings ter back him.""I shall not run for Miller and all his friends.Right is right, and I
have as good right here as he."cried Kate, admiringly; "hang me ef I don't like you-uns'
pluck.You may find that you'll need a friend afore yo're done with
Wade.Ef ye do--wal, mebbe Kate Kenyon won't be fur off.""It is a good thing to know I shall have one
friend in the mountains."Kenyon was seen stolidly standing in
the dusk."Mebbe you-uns will find my Kate ther best friend ye could
have.Come, gal, it's time ter g'win."So they entered the cabin, and Barney found an opportunity to whisper to
Frank:

"She's a corker, me b'y!an' Oi think she's shtuck on yez.Kenyon declared she was tired,
and intended to go to bed.She apologized for the bed she had to give
the boys, but they assured her that they were accustomed to sleeping
anywhere, and that the bed would be a positive luxury."Such slick-tongued chaps I never did see before," declared the old
woman."They don't seem stuck up an' lofty, like most city fellers.Really, they make me feel right to home in my own house!"She said this in a whimsical way that surprised Frank, who fancied Mrs.Kate bade them good-night, and they retired, which they were glad to do,
as they were tired from the tramp of the day.Frank was awakened by a sharp shake, and his first thought was of
danger, but his hand did not reach the revolver he had placed beneath
the pillow, for he felt something cold against his temple, and heard a
voice hiss:

"Be easy, you-uns!Ef ye make a jowl, yo're ter be shot!"Barney was awakened at the same time, and the boys found they were in
the clutches of strong men.The little room seemed filled with men, and
the lads instantly realized they were in a bad scrape.Through the small window sifted the white moonlight, showing that every
man wore a black, pointed cap and hood, which reached to his shoulders.In this hood arrangement great holes were cut for the eyes, and some had
slits cut for their mouths.was the thought that flashed through Frank's mind.The revolvers pressed against the heads of the boys kept them from
defending themselves or making an outcry.They were forced to get up and
dress, after which they were passed through the open window, like
bundles, their hands having been tied behind them.Other black-hooded men were outside, and horses were near at hand.But when he thought how tired they had been, he did not wonder that both
had slept soundly while the men slipped into the house by the window,
which had been readily and noiselessly removed.It did not take the men long to get out as they had entered.Then Frank
and Barney were placed on horses, being tied there securely, and the
party was soon ready to move.They rode away, and the horses' feet gave out no sound, which explained
why they had not aroused anybody within the cabin.The hoofs of the animals were muffled.Frank wondered what Kate Kenyon would think when morning came and she
found her guests gone."She will believe we rose in the night, and ran away.I hate to have her
believe me a coward."Then he fell to wondering what the men would do with himself and Barney.They will not dare to do anything more than
run us out of this part of the country."Although he told himself this, he was far from feeling sure that the men
would do nothing else.He had heard of the desperate deeds perpetrated
by the widely known "White Caps," and it was not likely that the Black
Caps were any less desperate and reckless.As they were leaving the vicinity of the cabin, one of the horses
neighed loudly, causing the leader of the party to utter an exclamation
of anger."Ef that 'rousts ther gal, she's li'bul ter be arter us in a hurry," one
of the men observed.The party hurried forward, soon passing from view of the cabin, and
entering the shadow that lay blackly in the depths of the valley.They rode about a mile, and then they came to a halt at a command from
the leader, and Frank noticed with alarm that they had stopped beneath a
large tree, with wide-spreading branches."This looks bad for us, old man," he whispered to Barney."Thot's pwhat it does, Frankie," admitted the Irish lad."Oi fale
throuble coming this way."The horsemen formed a circle about the captives, moving at a signal from
the leader, who did not seem inclined to waste words."Brothers o' ther Black Caps," said the leader, "what is ther fate
we-uns gives ter revenues?"Every man in the circle uttered the word, and they spoke all together."Now, why are we assembled ter-night?""Ter dispose o' spies," chorused the Black Caps.Each one of the black-hooded band extended a hand and pointed straight
at the captive boys."They shall be hanged," solemnly said the men.cried the leader, as if well satisfied.In a moment one of the men brought forth a rope.This was long enough to
serve for both boys, and it was quickly cut in two pieces, while
skillful hands proceeded to form nooses."Frankie," said Barney Mulloy, sadly, "we're done for.""It looks that way," Frank was forced to admit."Oi wouldn't moind so much," said the Irish lad, ruefully, "av we could
kick th' booket foighting fer our loives; but it is a bit harrud ter go
under widout a chance to lift a hand.""That's right," cried Frank, as he strained fiercely at the cords which
held his hands behind his back."It is the death of a criminal, and I
object to it."The leader of the Black Caps rode close to the boys, leaned forward in
his saddle, and hissed in Frank's ear:

"It's my turn now!""We-uns is goin' ter put two revenues
out o' ther way, that's all!""It's murder," cried Frank, in a ringing tone."You know we are not
revenue spies!We can prove that we are what we
claim to be--two boys who are tramping through the mountains for
pleasure.Will you kill us without giving us a chance to prove our
innocence?""It's ther same ol' whine," he said."Ther revenues alwus cry baby when
they're caught.You-uns can't fool us, an' we ain't got time ter waste
with ye.About the boys' necks the fatal ropes were quickly adjusted."If you murder us, you will find you have not
killed two friendless boys.We have friends--powerful friends--who will
follow this matter up--who will investigate it.You will be hunted down
and punished for the crime."Do you-uns think ye're stronger an' more
po'erful than ther United States Gover'ment?Ther United States
loses her spies, an' she can't tell who disposed o' 'em.We won't be
worried by all yore friends."He made another movement, and the rope ends were flung over a limb that
was strong enough to bear both lads.Hope was dying within Frank Merriwell's breast.At last he had reached
the end of his adventurous life, which had been short and turbulent.He
must die here amid these wild mountains, which flung themselves up
against the moonlit sky, and the only friend to be with him at the end
was the faithful friend who must die at his side.Frank's blood ran cold and sluggish in his veins.The spring night had
seemed warm and sweet, filled with the droning of insects; but now there
was a bitter chill in the air, and the white moonlight seemed to take on
a crimson tinge, as of blood.The boy's nature rebelled against the thought of meeting death in such a
manner.It was spring-time amid the mountains; with him it was the
spring-time of life.He had enjoyed the beautiful world, and felt strong
and brave to face anything that might come; but this he had not reckoned
on, and it was something to cause the stoutest heart to shake.Over the eastern mountains, craggy, wild, barren or pine-clad, the
gibbous moon swung higher and higher.The heavens were full of stars,
and every star seemed to be an eye that was watching to witness the
consummation of the tragedy down there in that little valley, through
which Lost Creek flowed on to its unknown destination.The silence was broken by a sound that made every black-hooded man start
and listen.Sweet and mellow and musical, from afar through the peaceful night, came
the clear notes of a bugle.Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!A fierce exclamation broke from the lips of the leader of the Black
Caps, and he grated:

"Muriel, by ther livin' gods!Quick, boys--finish this
job, an' git!""If that is Muriel, wait
for him--let him pronounce our fate.He is the chief of you all, and he
shall say if we are revenue spies."You-uns know too much, fer ye've called my name!Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!From much nearer, came the sound of the bugle, awakening hundreds of
mellow echoes, which were flung from crag to crag till it seemed that
the mountains were alive with buglers.The clatter of a horse's iron-shod feet could be heard, telling that the
rider was coming like the wind down the valley."Cut free ther feet o' ther pris'ners!"panted the leader of the Black
Caps.Muriel will be here in a few shakes, an' we-uns must
be done.Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!Through the misty moonlight a coal-black horse, bearing a rider who once
more awakens the clamoring echoes with his bugle, comes tearing at a mad
gallop.repeats Wade Miller, fiercely, as the black-hooded men
seem to hesitate.One of the men utters the command, and his companions hesitate."Muriel is death on revernues," says the one who had spoken, "an' thar
ain't any reason why we-uns shouldn't wait fer him."More than half the men agree with the one who has interrupted the
execution, filling Wade Miller with unutterable rage.snarled the chief ruffian of the party."I am leadin' you-uns
now, an' ye've gotter do ez I say.I order ye ter string them critters
up!"Nearer and nearer came the clattering hoof-beats."Av we can have wan minute more!""Half a minute will do," returned Frank."We refuse ter obey ye now," boldly spoke the man who had commanded his
companions to stop."Muriel has signaled ter us, an' he means fer us ter
wait till he-uns arrives."He snatched out a revolver, pointed it straight at Frank's breast, and
fired!Just as the desperate ruffian was pulling the trigger, the man nearest
him struck up his hand, and the bullet passed through Frank's hat,
knocking it to the ground.Miller was furious as a maniac, but, at this moment, the black horse
and the dashing rider burst in upon the scene, plunged straight through
the circle, halting at the side of the imperiled lads, the horse being
flung upon its haunches."Wal, what be you-uns doin'?""What work
is this, that I don't know erbout?"Wade Miller cowered before the chief of the
moonshiners, trying to hide the revolver.Muriel's eyes, gleaming through the twin holes of the mask he wore,
found Miller, and the clear voice cried:

"You-uns has been lettin' this critter lead ye inter somethin'!An' it's
fair warnin' I gave him ter keep clear o' meddlin' with my business."The boys gazed at the moonshiner chief in amazement, for Muriel looked
no more than a boy as he sat there on his black horse, and his voice
seemed the voice of a boy instead of that of a man.Yet it was plain
that he governed these desperate ruffians of the mountains with a hand
of iron, and they feared him."We-uns war 'bout ter hang two revernues," explained Miller."How long sence ther gover'ment has
been sendin' boys hyar ter spy on us?""They know what happens ter ther men they send," muttered Miller."Wal, 'tain't like they'd be sendin' boys arter men failed.""That's ther way they hope ter fool us.""An' how do you know them-uns is revernues?""We jest s'picions it.""An' you-uns war hangin' 'em on s'picion, 'thout lettin' me know?""We never knows whar ter find ye, Muriel.""That is nary excuse, fer ef you-uns had held them-uns a day I'd knowed
it.It looks like you-uns war in a monstr'us hurry.""It war he-uns," declared one of the black hoods, pointing to Miller."We don't gener'ly waste much time in dinkerin' 'roun' with anybody
we-uns thinks is revernues," said Miller."Wal, we ain't got ther record o' killin' innercent boys, an' we don't
begin now.Two men hastened to obey the order, while Miller sat and grated his
teeth.As this was being done, Muriel asked:

"What war you-uns doin' with that revolver when I come?I heard ye
shoot, an' I saw ther flash.Miller stammered and stuttered till Muriel repeated the question, his
voice cold and hard, despite its boyish caliber."Wal," said Wade, reluctantly, "I'll have ter tell yer.I shot at
he-uns," and he pointed at Frank."I thought so," was all Muriel said.When the ropes were removed from the necks of the boys, Muriel directed
that their feet be tied again, and their eyes blindfolded.These orders were attended to with great swiftness, and then the
moonshiner chief said:

"Follow!"Out they rode from beneath the tree, and away through the misty
moonlight.Frank and Barney could not see, but they felt well satisfied with their
lot, for they had been saved from death for the time being, and,
somehow, they felt that Muriel did not mean to harm them."Frank," whispered Barney, "are yez there?""Here," replied Frank, close at hand."It's dead lucky we are to be livin', me b'y."I feel like singing a song of praise and
thanksgiving.But we're not out of the woods yet.""Thot Muriel is a dandy, Frankie!Oi'm shtuck on his stoyle."I wonder how he happened to appear at such an
opportune moment?""Nivver a bit do Oi know, but it's moighty lucky fer us thot he did."Frank fell to speculating over the providential appearance of the
moonshiner chief.It was plain that Muriel must have known that
something was happening, and he had signaled with the bugle to the Black
Caps.In all probability, other executions had taken place beneath that
very tree, for the young chief came there direct, without hesitation.For nearly an hour they seemed to ride through the night, and then they
halted.The boys were removed from the horses and compelled to march
into some kind of a building.After some moments, their hands were freed, and, tearing away the
blindfolds, they found themselves in a low, square room, with no
windows, and a single door.With his back to the door, stood Muriel.The light of a swinging oil lamp illumined the room.Muriel leaned gracefully against the door, his arms folded, and his eyes
gleaming where the lamplight shone on them through the twin holes in the
sable mask.The other moonshiners had disappeared, and the boys were alone in that
room with the chief of the mountain desperadoes.There was something strikingly cool and self-reliant in Muriel's
manner--something that caused Frank to think that the fellow, young as
he was, feared nothing on the face of the earth.At the same time there was no air of bravado or insolence about that
graceful pose and the quiet manner in which he was regarding them.Instead of that, the moonshiner was a living interrogation point,
everything about him seeming to speak the question that fell from his
lips."You must know
that we will lie if we are, and so you will hear our denial anyway."Look hyar--she tol' me fair an' squar' that you-uns warn't revernues,
but I dunno how she could tell."Frank fancied that he knew, but he put the question, and Muriel
answered:

"Ther gal that saved yore lives by comin' ter me an' tellin' me ther
boys had taken you outer her mammy's house."She did save our lives, for if you had been one minute
later you would not have arrived in time.Muriel moved uneasily, and he did not seem pleased by Frank's words,
although his face could not be seen.It was some moments before he
spoke, but his voice was strangely cold and hard when he did so."It's well ernough fer you-uns ter remember her, but ye'd best take car'
how ye speak o' her.She's got friends in ther maountings--true
friends."Frank was startled, and he felt the hot blood rush to his face.Then, in
a moment, he cried:

"Friends!Well, she has no truer friends than the boys she saved
to-night!I hope you will not misconstrue our words, Mr.A sound like a smothered laugh came from behind that baffling mask, and
Muriel said:

"Yo're hot-blooded.I war simply warnin' you-uns in advance, that's all.We esteem Miss Kenyon too highly to say
anything that can give a friend of hers just cause to strike against
us.""Wal, city chaps are light o' tongue, an' they're apt ter think that
ev'ry maounting girl is a fool ef she don't have book learnin'.Some
city chaps make their boast how easy they kin'mash' such gals.Anything
like that would count agin' you-uns."Frank was holding himself in check with an effort."It is plain you do not know us, and you have greatly misjudged us.We
are not in the mountains to make'mashes,' and we are not the kind to
boast of our conquests.""Thot's right, me jool!"growled Barney, whose temper was started a bit."An' it's mesilf thot loikes to be suspected av such a thing.It shtirs
me foighting blud."The Irish lad clinched his fist, and felt of his muscle, moving his
forearm up and down, and scowling blackly at the cool chief of
moonshiners, as if longing to thump the fellow.This seemed to amuse Muriel, but still he persisted in further arousing
the lads by saying, insinuatingly:

"I war led ter b'lieve that Kate war ruther interested in you-uns by her
manner.Thar don't no maounting gal take so much trouble over strangers
fer nothin'!"Frank bit his lip, and Barney looked blacker than ever.It seemed that
Muriel was trying to draw them into a trap of some sort, and they were
growing suspicious.Had this young leader of mountain ruffians rescued
them that he might find just cause or good excuse to put them out of the
way?The boys were silent, and Muriel forced a laugh."Wal, ye won't talk about that, an' so we'll go onter somethin' else.I
judge you-uns know yo're in a po'erful bad scrape?"exclaimed Barney, feeling of his neck, and
making a wry face, as if troubled by an unpleasant recollection."It is a scrape that you-uns may not be able ter git out of easy,"
Muriel said."I war able ter save yer from bein' hung 'thout any show at
all, but ye're not much better off now.""If you were powerful enough to save us in the first place, you should
be able to get us out of the scrape entirely.""You-uns don't know all about it.Moonshiners have laws an' regulations,
an' even ther leader must stan' by them."Frank was still troubled by the unpleasant suspicion that Muriel was
their enemy, after all that had happened.He felt that they must guard
their tongues, for there was no telling what expression the fellow might
distort and turn against them.Seeing neither of the lads was going to speak, Muriel went on:

"Yes, moonshiners have laws and regulations.Ther boys came nigh
breakin' one o' ther laws by hangin' you-uns ter-night 'thout givin' ye
a show.""Then we are to have a fair deal?""Ez fair ez anybody gits," assured Muriel, tossing back a lock of his
coal-black hair, which he wore long enough to fall to the collar of his
coat."Ain't that all ye kin ask?"That depends on what kind of a deal it is.""Wall, ye'll be given yore choice."If it is proven that we are revenue spies,
we'll have to take our medicine.But if it is not proven, we demand
immediate release.""Take my advice; don't demand anything o' ther Black Caps.Ther more ye
demand, ther less ye git.""We have a right to demand a fair deal.""Right don't count in this case; it is might that holds ther fort.You-uns stirred up a tiger ag'in' ye when you made Wade Miller mad.It's
a slim show that ye escape ef we-uns lets yer go instanter.He'd foller
yer, an' he'd finish yer somewhar."We have taken care of ourselves so
far, and we think we can continue to do so.All we ask is that we be set
at liberty and given our weapons.""An' ye'd be found with yer throats cut within ten miles o' hyar.""Wal, 'cordin' to our rules, ye can't be released onless ther vote ur
ther card sez so.""Wal, it's like this: Ef it's put ter vote, one black bean condemns
you-uns ter death, an' ev'ry man votes black ur white, as he chooses.I
don't judge you-uns care ter take yer chances that way?""Oi sh'u'd soay not!Ixchuse us from thot, me hearty!""There would be one
vote against us--one black bean thrown, at least.""Pwhat av th' carruds?""Two men will be chosen, one ter hold a pack o' cards, and one to draw a
card from them.Ef ther card is red, it lets you-uns off, fer it means
life; ef it is black, it cooks yer, fer it means death."The boys were silent, dumfounded, appalled.Muriel stood watching them, and Frank fancied that his eyes were
gleaming with satisfaction.The boy began to believe he had mistaken the
character of this astonishing youth; Muriel might be even worse than his
older companions, for he might be one who delighted in torturing his
victims.Frank threw back his head, defiance and scorn written on his handsome
face."It is a clean case of murder, at best!"he cried, his voice ringing out
clearly."We deserve a fair trial--we demand it!""Wal," drawled the boy moonshiner, "I warned you-uns that ther more yer
demanded, ther less yer got."We're in fur it, Frankie, me b'y!""If we had our revolvers, we'd give them a stiff fight for it!""They would not murder us till a few of them had eaten
lead!""You-uns has stuff, an' when I tell yer that ye'll have ter sta' ter
vote ur take chances with ther cards, I don't judge you'll hesitate."Then, make it the cards," said Frank, hoarsely."That will give us an
even show, if the draw is a fair one.""I'll see ter that," assured Muriel.Without another word, he turned and swiftly slipped out of the room.They heard him bar the door, and then they stood looking into each
other's faces, speechless for a few moments."It's a toss-up, Barney," Frank finally observed."Thot's pwhat it is, an' th' woay our luck is runnin' Oi think it's a
case av heads they win an' tails we lose.""But there is no way out of it."Pwhat do yez think av thot Muriel?""Worse than thot, me b'y--he's a cat's cradle toied in a hundred an'
sivintane knots.""It is impossible to tell whether he is friendly or whether he is the
worst foe we have in these mountains.""Oi wonder how Kate Kenyon knew where to foind him so quick?"She must have found him in a very short time
after we were taken from the cabin.""An' she diskivered thot we hed been taken away moighty soon afther we
wur gone, me b'y.It may have aroused Kate and her
mother, and caused them to investigate.""Loikely thot wur th' case, fer it's not mesilf thot would think she'd
kape shtill an' let ther spalpanes drag us away av she knew it.""No; I believe her utterly fearless, and it is plain that Wade Miller is
not the only one in love with her.""Mebbe ye're roight, Frankie."The fellow tried to lead me into a trap--tried
to get me to boast of a mash on her.I could see his eyes gleam with
jealousy.In her eagerness to save us--to have him aid her in the
work--she must have led him to suspect that one of us had been making
love to her."Barney whistled a bit, and then he shyly said:

"Oi wunder av wan of us didn't do a bit av thot?""We talked in a friendly manner--in fact, she
promised to be a friend to me.I may have expressed admiration for her
hair, or something of the sort, but I vow I did not make love to her.""Well, me b'y, ye have a thrick av gettin' all th' girruls shtuck on yez
av ye look at thim, so ye didn't nade ter make love.""It's nivver a fault at all, at all, me lad.Oi wish Oi wur built th'
soame woay, but it's litthle oice I cut wid th' girruls.This south av
Oireland brogue thot Oi foind mesilf unable to shake counts against me a
bit, Oi belave.""I should think Miller and Muriel would clash.""It's plain enough that Miller is afraid av Muriel.""And Muriel intends to keep him thus.I fancy it was a good thing for us
that Kate Kenyon suspected Wade Miller of having a hand in our capture,
and told Muriel that we had been carried off by him, for I fancy that is
exactly what happened.Muriel was angry with Miller, and he seized the
opportunity to call the fellow down.But for that, he might not have
made such a hustle to save us.""Thin we should be thankful thot Muriel an' Miller do not love ache
ither."The boys continued to discuss the situation for some time, and then they
fell to examining the room in which they were imprisoned.It did not
seem to have a window anywhere, and the single door appeared to be the
only means of entering or leaving the place."There's little show of escaping from this room," said Frank."This wur built to kape iverything safe
thot came in here."A few minutes later there was a sound at the door, and Muriel came in,
with two of the Black Caps at his heels."Ther boys have agreed ter give ye ther chance o' ther cards," said the
boy moonshiner."An' yo're goin' ter have a fair an' squar' deal.""We will have to submit," said Frank, quietly."You will have ter let ther boys bind yer hands afore ye leave this
room," said Muriel.The men each held the end of a stout rope, and the boys were forced to
submit to the inconvenience of having their hands bound behind them.Barney protested, but Frank kept silent, knowing it was useless to say
anything.When their hands were tied, Muriel said:

"Follow."He led the way, while Frank came next, with Barney shuffling sulkily
along at his heels.They passed through a dark room and entered another room, which was
lighted by three oil lamps.The room was well filled with the
black-hooded moonshiners, who were standing in a grim and silent
circle, with their backs against the walls.Into the center of this circle, the boys were marched.The door closed,
and Muriel addressed the Black Caps."It is not often that we-uns gives our captives ther choice uv ther
cards or ther vote, but we have agreed ter do so in this case, with only
one objectin', an' he war induced ter change his mind.Now we mean ter
have this fair an' squar', an' I call on ev'ry man present ter watch out
an' see that it is.Ther men has been serlected, one ter hold ther cards
an' one ter draw.Two of the Black Caps stepped out, and Frank started a bit, for he
believed one of them was Wade Miller.A pack of cards was produced, and Muriel shuffled them with a skill that
told of experience, after which he handed them to one of the men.Frank watched every move, determined to detect the fraud if possible,
should there be any fraud.An awed hush seemed to settle over the room.The men who wore the black hoods leaned forward a little, every one of
them watching to see what card should be drawn from the pack.Barney Mulloy caught his breath with a gasping sound, and then was
silent, standing stiff and straight.Muriel was as alert as a panther, and his eyes gleamed through the holes
in his mask like twin stars.The man who received the pack from Muriel stepped forward, and Miller
reached out his hand to draw.Then Frank suddenly cried:

"Wait!That we may be satisfied we are having a fair show in this
matter, why not permit one of us to shuffle those cards?"Quick as a flash of light, Muriel's hand fell on the wrist of the man
who held the cards, and his clear voice rang out:

"Stop!Frank's hands were unbound, and he was given the cards.He shuffled
them, but he did not handle them with more skill than had Muriel.He
"shook them up" thoroughly, and then passed them back to the man who
was to hold them.Muriel's order was swiftly obeyed, and Frank was again helpless.Wade Miller reached out, and quickly made the
draw, holding the fateful card up for all to see.From beneath the black hoods sounded the terrible word, as the man
beheld the black card which was exposed to view.Frank's heart dropped like a stone into the depths of his bosom, but no
sound came from his lips.Barney Mulloy showed an equal amount of nerve.Indeed, the Irish lad
laughed recklessly as he cried:

"It's nivver a show we had at all, at all, Frankie.Th' snakes had it
fixed fer us all th' toime."The words came from Muriel, and the boy chief of the moonshiners made a
spring and a grab, snatching the card from Miller's hand.Let's give ther critters a fair
show.""Do you mean ter say they didn't have a fair show?""Not knowin' it," answered Muriel."But ther draw warn't fair, jes' ther
same."One is ther ace o' spades, an' ther other is ther
nine o' hearts."Exclamations of astonishment came from all sides, and a ray of hope shot
into Frank Merriwell's heart.Ther black card war ther one exposed, an' that settles what'll be
done with ther spies.""Them boys is goin' ter
have a squar' show."It was with the greatest difficulty that Miller held himself in check.His hands were clinched, and Frank fancied that he longed to spring upon
Muriel.The boy chief was very cool as he took the pack of cards from the hand
of the man who had held them."Release one of the prisoners," was his command."The cards shall be
shuffled again."Once more Frank's hands were freed, and again the cards were given him
to shuffle.He mixed them deftly, without saying a word, and gave them
back to Muriel.Then his hands were tied, and he awaited the second
drawing."Be careful an' not get two cards this time," warned Muriel as he faced
Miller."This draw settles ther business fer them-uns."The cards were given to the man who was to hold them, and Miller stepped
forward to draw.Again the suspense became great, again the men leaned forward to see the
card that should be pulled from the pack; again the hearts of the
captives stood still.He seemed to feel that the tide had turned against
him.For a moment he was tempted to refuse to draw, and then, with a
muttered exclamation, he pulled a card from the pack and held it up to
view.Then, with a bitter cry of baffled rage, he flung it madly to the
floor.Each man in the room seemed to draw a deep breath.It was plain that
some were disappointed, and some were well satisfied."They-uns won't be put out o'
ther way ter-night.""An' I claim that it don't," returned the youthful moonshiner, without
lifting his voice in the least."You-uns all agreed ter ther second
draw, an' that lets them off.""But
them critters ain't out o' ther maountings yit!""By that yer mean--jes' what?""They're not liable ter git out alive.""Ef they-uns is killed, I'll know whar ter look fer ther one as war at
ther bottom o' ther job--an' I'll look!"Muriel did not bluster, and he did not speak above an ordinary tone, but
it was plain that he meant every word."Wal," muttered Miller, "what do ye mean ter do with them critters--turn
'em out, an' let 'em bring ther officers down on us?"I'm goin' ter keep 'em till they kin be escorted out o' ther
maountings.Thar ain't time ter-night, fer it's gittin' toward mornin'.Ter-morrer night it can be done."He seemed to know it was useless to make further
talk, but Frank and Barney knew that they were not yet out of danger.The boys seemed as cool as any one in the room, for all of the deadly
peril they had passed through, and Muriel nodded in a satisfied way when
he had looked them over."Come," he said, in a low tone, "you-uns will have ter go back ter ther
room whar ye war a bit ago."They were willing to go back, and it was with no small amount of relief
that they allowed themselves to be escorted to the apartment.Muriel dismissed the two guards, and then he set the hands of the boys
free."Suspecting you of double-dealing."It seemed that you had saved us from being
hanged, but that you intended to finish us here.""Ef that war my scheme, why did I take ther trouble ter save ye at all?""It looked as if you did so to please Miss Kenyon.You had saved us, and
then, if the men disposed of us in the regular manner, you would not be
to blame."Muriel shook back his long, black hair, and his manner showed that he
was angry.He did not feel at all pleased to know his sincerity had been
doubted."Wal," he said, slowly, "ef it hadn't been fer me you-uns would be gone
<DW53>s now.""You-uns know I saved ye, but ye don't know how I done it."There was something of bitterness and reproach in the voice of the
youthful moonshiner.He continued:

"I done that fer you I never done before fer no man.I wouldn't a done
it fer myself!""Do you-uns want ter know what I done?""When I snatched ther first card drawn from ther hand o' ther man what
drawed it.It war ther ace o' spades, an' it condemned yer ter die."Thar war one card drawed, an' that war all!""That war whar I cheated," he said, simply."I had ther red card in my
hand ready ter do ther trick ef a black card war drawed.In that way I
knowed I could give yer two shows ter escape death."The boys were astounded by this revelation, but they did not doubt that
Muriel spoke the truth.His manner showed that he was not telling a
falsehood.And this strange boy--this remarkable leader of moonshiners--had done
such a thing to save them!More than ever, they marveled at the fellow.Once more Muriel's arms were folded over his breast, and he was leaning
gracefully against the door, his eyes watching their faces.For several moments both boys were stricken dumb with wonder and
surprise.Frank was not a little confused, thinking as he did how he had
misunderstood this mysterious youth.It seemed most unaccountable that he should do such a thing for two
lads who were utter strangers to him.A sound like a bitter laugh came from behind the sable mask, and Muriel
flung out one hand, with an impatient gesture."I know what you-uns is thinkin' of," declared the young moonshiner."Ye
wonder why I done so.Wal, I don't jes' know myself, but I promised Kate
ter do my best fer ye."cried Frank, "kept it nobly!Muriel, you
may be a moonshiner, you may be the leader of the Black Caps, but I am
proud to know you!I believe you are white all the way through!"exclaimed the youth, with a show of satisfaction, "that makes me
feel better.But it war Kate as done it, an' she's ther one ter thank;
but it ain't likely you-uns'll ever see her ag'in.""Then, tell her," said Frank, swiftly, "tell her for us that we are very
thankful--tell her we shall not forget her.He seemed about to speak, and then checked
himself."I'll tell her," nodded Muriel, his voice sounding a bit strange."Is
that all you-uns want me ter tell her?""Tell her I would give much to see her again," came swiftly from Frank's
lips."She's promised to be my friend, and right well has she kept that
promise.""Then I'll have ter leave you-uns now.Breakfast will be brought ter ye, and when another night comes, a guard
will go with yer out o' ther maountings.He held out a hand, and Muriel seemed to hesitate.After a few moments,
the masked lad shook his head, and, without another word, left the room.cried Barney, scratching his head, "thot felly is worse than
Oi thought!Oi don't know so much about him now as Oi did bafore Oi met
him at all, at all!"They made themselves as
comfortable as possible, and talked over the thrilling events of the
night."If Kate Kenyon had not told me that her brother was serving time as a
convict, I should think this Muriel must be her brother," said Frank."Av he's not her brither, it's badly shtuck on her he must be, Oi
dunno," observed Barney."An' av he be shtuck on her, pwhoy don't he git
onter th' collar av thot Miller?"Finally, when they had tired
of talking, the boys lay down and tried to sleep.Frank was beginning to doze when his ears seemed to detect a slight
rustling in that very room, and his eyes flew open in a twinkling.He
started up, a cry of wonder surging to his lips, and being smothered
there.Kate Kenyon stood within ten feet of him!As Frank started up, the girl swiftly placed a finger on her lips,
warning him to be silent.Frank sprang to his feet, and Barney Mulloy sat up, rubbing his eyes and
beginning to speak."Pwhat's th' matter now, me b'y?Are yez---- Howly shmoke!"Barney clasped both hands over his mouth, having caught the warning
gestures from Frank and the girl.Still the exclamation had escaped his
lips, although it was not uttered loudly.Swiftly Kate Kenyon flitted across the room, listening with her ear to
the door to hear any sound beyond.After some moments, she seemed
satisfied that the moonshiners had not been aroused by anything that had
happened within that room, and she came back, standing close to Frank,
and whispering:

"Ef you-uns will trust me, I judge I kin git yer out o' this scrape."exclaimed Frank, softly, as he caught her hand."We have
you to thank for our lives!Kate--your pardon!--Miss Kenyon, how can we
ever repay you?""Don't stop ter talk 'bout that now," she said, with chilling
roughness."Ef you-uns want ter live, an' yer want ter git erway frum
Wade Miller, git reddy ter foller me.""But how are we to leave this room?She silently pointed to a dark opening in the corner, and they saw that
a small trapdoor was standing open."We kin git out that way," she said.The boys wondered why they had not discovered the door when they
examined the place, but there was no time for investigation.Kate Kenyon flitted lightly toward the opening.Pausing beside it, she
pointed downward, saying:

"Go ahead; I'll foller and close ther door."The boys did not hesitate, for they placed perfect confidence in the
girl now.Barney dropped down in advance, and his feet found some rude
stone steps.In a moment he had disappeared, and then Frank followed.As lightly as a fairy, Kate Kenyon dropped through the opening, closing
the door behind her.The boys found themselves in absolute darkness, in some sort of a
narrow, underground place, and there they paused, awaiting their guide.Her hand touched Frank as she slipped past, and he
caught the perfume of wild flowers.To him she was like a beautiful wild
flower growing in a wilderness of weeds.The boys heard the word, and they moved slowly forward through the
darkness, now and then feeling dank walls on either hand.For a considerable distance they went on in this way, and then the
passage seemed to widen out, and they felt that they had entered a cave."Keep close ter me," directed the girl.Now you-uns can't git astray."At last a strange smell came to their nostrils, seemingly on the wings
of a light breath of air."Ther mill whar ther moonshine is made."Never for a moment did she
hesitate; she seemed to have the eyes of an owl.All at once they heard the sound of gently running water."Lost Creek runs through har," answered the girl.So the mysterious stream flowed through this cavern, and the cave was
near one of the illicit distilleries.Frank cared to know no more, for he did not believe it was healthy to
know too much about the makers of moonshine.It was not long before they approached the mouth of the cave.They saw
the opening before them, and then, of a sudden, a dark figure arose
there--the figure of a man with a gun in his hands!FRANK'S SUSPICION.Kate uttered the words, and the boys began to recover from their alarm,
as she did not hesitate in the least.I put him thar ter watch
out while I war in hyar."Of a sudden, Kate struck a match, holding it so the
light shone on her face, and the figure at the mouth of the cave was
seen to wave its hand and vanish."Ther coast is clear," assured the girl."But it's gittin' right nigh
mornin', an' we-uns must hustle away from hyar afore it is light.The boys were well satisfied to get away as quickly as possible.They passed out of the dark cavern into the cool, sweet air of a spring
morning, for the gray of dawn was beginning to dispel the darkness, and
the birds were twittering from the thickets.The phantom of a moon was in the sky, hanging low down and half-inverted
as if spilling a spectral glamour over the ghostly mists which lay deep
in Lost Creek Valley.The sweet breath of flowers and of the woods was in the morning air, and
from some cabin afar on the side of a distant mountain a wakeful
watchdog barked till the crags reverberated with his clamoring."Thar's somethin' stirrin' at 'Bize Wiley's, ur his dorg wouldn't be
kickin' up all that racket," observed Kate Kenyon."He lives by ther
road that comes over from Bildow's Crossroads.Folks comin' inter ther
maountings from down below travel that way."The boys looked around for the mute who had been guarding the mouth of
the cave, but they saw nothing of him.He had slipped away into the
bushes which grew thick all around the opening."Come on," said the girl, after seeming strangely interested in the
barking of the dog."We'll git ter ther old mill as soon as we kin.Foller me, an' be ready ter scrouch ther instant anything is seen."Now that they could see her, she led them forward at a swift pace, which
astonished them both.She did not run, but she seemed to skim over the
ground, and she took advantage of every bit of cover till they entered
some deep, lowland pines.Through this strip of woods she swiftly led them, and they came near to
Lost Creek, where it flowed down in the dismal valley.There they found the ruins of an old mill, the moss-covered water-wheel
forever silent, the roof sagging and falling in, the windows broken out
by mischievous boys, the whole presenting a most melancholy and deserted
appearance.The road that had led to the mill from the main highway was overgrown
with weeds.Later it would be filled with thistles and burdocks.Wild
sassafras grew along the roadside."That's whar you-uns must hide ter-day," said Kate, motioning toward the
mill."We are not criminals, nor are we
revenue spies.I do not fancy the idea of hiding like a hunted dog.""It's better ter be a live dorg than a dead lion.Ef you-uns'll take my
advice, you'll come inter ther mill thar, an' ye'll keep thar all day,
an' keep mighty quiet.I know ye're nervy, but thar ain't no good in
bein' foolish.It'll be known that you-uns have escaped, an' then Wade
Miller will scour ther country.Ef he come on yer----"

"Give us our arms, and we'll be ready to meet Mr."But yer wouldn't meet him alone; thar'd be others with him, an' you-uns
wouldn't have no sorter show."Kate finally succeeded in convincing the boys that she spoke the truth,
and they agreed to remain quietly in the old mill.She led them into the mill, which was dank and dismal.The imperfect
light failed to show all the pitfalls that lurked for their feet, but
she warned them, and they escaped injury.The miller had lived in the mill, and the girl took them to the part of
the old building that had served as a home."Har," she said, opening a closet door, "I've brung food fer you-uns, so
yer won't starve, an' I knowed ye'd be hongry.""You are more than thoughtful, Miss Kenyon.""Yer seem ter have fergot what we agreed ter call each other, Frank."She spoke the words in a tone of reproach.Barney turned away, winking uselessly at nothing at all, and kept his
back toward them for some moments.But Frank Merriwell had no thought of making love to this strange girl
of the mountains.She had promised to be his friend; she had proved
herself his friend, and as no more than a friend did he propose to
accept her.That he had awakened something stronger than a friendly feeling in Kate
Kenyon's breast seemed evident, and the girl was so artless that she
could not conceal her true feelings toward him.They stood there, talking in a low tone, while the morning light stole
in at one broken window and grew stronger and stronger within that room.As he did so a new thought
came to him--a thought that was at first a mere suspicion, which he
scarcely noted at all.This suspicion grew, and he found himself asking:

"Kate, are you sure your brother is still wearing a convict's suit?""You do not know that he is dead--you have not heard of his death?"Her eyes flashed, and a look of pride swept across her face."Folks allus 'lowed Rufe Kenyon wa'n't afeard o' ary two-legged critter
livin', an' they war right."She clutched his arm, beginning to pant, as she asked:

"What makes you say that?I knowed he'd try it some day, but--but, have
you heard anything?The suspicion leaped to a conviction in the twinkling of an eye.If Rufe
Kenyon was not at liberty, then he must be right in what he thought."I do not know that your brother has tried to escape.I did think that he might be Muriel, the
moonshiner.""You-uns war plumb mistooken thar," she said, positively."Rufe is not
Muriel.""Then," cried Frank, "you are Muriel yourself!""Have you-uns gone plumb dafty?"asked the girl, in a dazed way."But you are--I am sure of it," said Frank, swiftly.Of course I'm not Muriel; but he's ther best
friend I've got in these maountings."Frank was far from satisfied, but he was too courteous to insist after
this denial.Kate laughed the idea to scorn, saying over and over that
the boy must be "dafty," but still his mind was unchanged.To be sure, there were some things not easily explained, one being how
Muriel concealed her luxurious red hair, for Muriel's hair appeared to
be coal-black.Another thing was that Wade Miller must know Muriel and Kate were one
and the same, and yet he preserved her secret and allowed her to snatch
his victims from his maws.Barney Mulloy had been more than astounded by Frank's words; the Irish
youth was struck dumb.When he could collect himself, he softly
muttered:

"Well, av all th' oideas thot takes th' cake!"Having seen them safely within the mill and shown them the food brought
there, Kate said:

"Har is two revolvers fer you-uns.Don't use 'em unless yer have ter,
but shoot ter kill ef you're forced."Oi'm ready fer th' spalpanes!"cried Barney, as he grasped one
of the weapons."Next time Wade Miller and his
gang will not catch us napping.""Roight, me b'y; we'll be sound awake, Frankie."Kate bade them good-by, assuring them that she would return with the
coming of another night, and making them promise to await her, and then
she flitted away, slipped out of the mill, soon vanishing amid the
pines."It's dead lucky we are ter be living, Frankie," observed Barney."I quite agree with you," laughed Merriwell."This night has been a
black and tempestuous one, but we have lived through it, and I do not
believe we'll find ourselves in such peril again while we are in the
Tennessee mountains."They were hungry, and they ate heartily of the plain food that had been
provided for them.When breakfast was over, Barney said:

"Frankie, it's off yer trolley ye git sometoimes.""What do you mean by that, Barney?Oi wur thinkin' av pwhat yez said about Kate Kenyon being
Mooriel, th' moonshoiner.""I was not off my trolley so very much then.""G'wan, me b'y!"You think so, but I have made a study of Muriel and of Kate Kenyon.I
am still inclined to believe the moonshiner is the girl in disguise.""An' Oi say ye're crazy.No girrul could iver do pwhat thot felly does,
an' no band av min loike th' moonshoiners would iver allow a girrul
loike Kate Kenyon ter boss thim.""They do not know Muriel is a girl.That is, I am sure the most of them
do not know it--do not dream it.""Thot shows their common sinse, fer Oi don't belave it mesilf.""I may be wrong, but I shall not give it up yet.""Whoy, think pwhat a divvil thot Muriel is!An' th' color av his hair is
black, whoile the girrul's is red.""I have thought of those things, and I have wondered how she concealed
that mass of red hair; still I am satisfied she does it.""Well, it's no use to talk to you at all, at all."However, they did discuss it for some time.Finally they fell to exploring the old mill, and they wandered from one
part to another till they finally came to the place where they had
entered over a sagging plank.They were standing there, just within the
deeper shadow of the mill, when a man came panting and reeling from the
woods, his hat off, his shirt torn open at the throat, great drops of
perspiration standing on his face, a wild, hunted look in his eyes, and
dashed to the end of the plank that led over the water into the old
mill.Frank clutched Barney, and the boys fell back a step, watching the man,
who was looking back over his shoulder and listening, the perfect
picture of a hunted thing."They're close arter me--ther dogs!"came in a hoarse pant from the
man's lips."But I turned on 'em--I doubled--an' I hope I fooled 'em.It's my last chance, fer I'm dead played, and I'm so nigh starved that
it's all I kin do ter drag one foot arter t'other."He listened again, and then, as if overcome by a sudden fear of being
seen there, he suddenly rushed across the plank and plunged into the
mill.In the twinkling of an eye man and boy were clasped in a close embrace,
struggling desperately.He tried to hurl Frank to the floor, and he would have succeeded had he
been in his normal condition, for he was a man of great natural
strength; but he was exhausted by flight and hunger, and, in his
weakened condition, the man found his supple antagonist too much for
him.A gasp came from the stranger's lips as he felt the boy give him a
wrestler's trip and fling him heavily to the floor.When he opened his eyes, Frank and
Barney were bending over him."Wal, I done my best," he said, huskily; "but you-uns trapped me at
last.I dunno how yer knew I war comin' har, but ye war on hand ter meet
me.""You have made a mistake," said Frank, in a reassuring tone."We are not
your enemies at all.""We are not your enemies; you are not trapped."The man seemed unable to believe what he heard."Fugitives, like yourself," assured Frank, with a smile.He looked them over, and shook his head.I'm wore ter ther bone--I'm a
wreck!Oh, it's a cursed life I've led sence they dragged me away from
har!Night an' day hev I watched for a chance ter break away, and' I war
quick ter grasp it when it came.They shot at me, an' one o' their
bullets cut my shoulder har.It war a close call, but I got away.Then
they follered, an' they put houn's arter me.Twenty times hev they been
right on me, an' twenty times hev I got erway.But it kep' wearin' me
weaker an' thinner.My last hope war ter find friends ter hide me an'
fight fer me, an' I came har--back home!I tried ter git inter 'Bije
Wileys' this mornin', but his dorg didn't know me, I war so changed, an'
ther hunters war close arter me, so I hed ter run fer it."exclaimed Barney; "we hearrud th' dog barruckin'.""So we did," agreed Frank, remembering how the creature had been
clamoring on the mountainside at daybreak."I kem har," continued the man, weakly."I turned on ther devils, but
when I run in har an' you-uns tackled me, I judged I had struck a trap.""It was no trap, Rufe Kenyon," said Frank, quietly.The hunted man started up and slunk away."An' still ye say you-uns are not my enemies.""No; but we have heard of you.""She saved us from certain death last night, and she brought us here to
hide till she can help us get out of this part of the country.""I judge you-uns is givin' it ter me straight," he said, slowly; "but I
don't jes' understan'."What had moonshiners agin' you-uns?"Well, we are not spies; but we were unfortunate enough to incur the
enmity of Wade Miller, and he has sworn to end our lives."cried Rufe, showing his teeth in an ugly manner."An' I
s'pose he's hangin' 'roun' Kate, same as he uster?""He is giving her more or less trouble.""Wal, he won't give her much trouble arter I git at him.I'm goin' ter tell you-uns somethin'.Miller allus pretended
ter be my friend, but it war that critter as put ther revernues onter me
an' got me arrested!He done it because I tol' him Kate war too good fer
him.I know it, an' one thing why I wanted ter git free war ter come har
an' fix ther critter so he won't ever bother Kate no more.I hev swore
ter fix him, an' I'll do it ef I live ter meet him face ter face!"He had grown wildly excited, and he sat up, with his back against a
post, his eyes gleaming redly, and a white foam flecking his lips.At
that moment he reminded the boys of a mad dog.When Kenyon was calmer, Frank told the story of the adventures which had
befallen the boys since entering Lost Creek Valley.The fugitive
listened quietly, watching them closely with his sunken eyes, and,
having heard all, said:

"I judge you-uns tells ther truth.Ef I kin keep hid till Kate gits
har--till I see her--I'll fix things so you won't be bothered much.Wade
Miller's day in Lost Creek Valley is over."The boys took him up to the living room of the old mill, where they
furnished him with the coarse food that remained from their breakfast.He ate like a famished thing, washing the dry bread down with great
swallows of water.When he had finished and his hunger was satisfied, he
was quite like another man.he cried; "now I am reddy fer anything!"And you'll tell me ef thar's danger?"So the hunted wretch was induced to lie down and sleep.He slept soundly
for some hours, and, when he opened his eyes, his sister had her arms
about his neck.He sat up and clasped her in his arms, a look of joy on his face.It is quite unnecessary to describe the joys of that meeting.The boys
had left brother and sister alone together, and the two remained thus
for nearly an hour, at the end of which time Rufe knew all that had
happened since he was taken from Lost Creek Valley, and Kate had also
been made aware of the perfidy of Wade Miller."I judge it is true that bread throwed on ther waters allus comes back,"
said Kate, when the four were together."Now looker how I helped
you-uns, an' then see how it turned out ter be a right good thing fer
Rufe.He found ye har, an' you-uns hev fed him an' watched while he
slept.""An' I hev tol' Kate all about Wade Miller," said the fugitive."That settles him," declared the girl, with a snap."Kate says ther officers think I hev gone on over inter ther next cove,
an' they're arter me, all 'ceptin' two what have been left behind.They'll be back, though, by night.""But you are all right now, for your friends will be on hand by that
time.""Yes; Kate will take word ter Muriel, an' he'll hev ther boys ready ter
fight fer me.Ther officers will find it kinder hot in these parts.""I'd better be goin' now," said the girl."Ther boys oughter know all
about it soon as possible.""That's right," agreed Rufe."This ain't ther best place fer me ter
hide.""No," declared Kate, suddenly; "an' yer mustn't hide har longer, fer
ther officers may come afore night.It
won't do fer ther boys ter go thar, but you kin all right.Ther boys is
best off har, fer ther officers wouldn't hurt 'em."This seemed all right, and it was decided on.Just as they were on the point of descending, Barney gave a cry, caught
Frank by the arm, and drew him toward a window."Phwat do yez think av it
now?"A horseman was coming down the old road that led to the mill.He
bestrode a coal-black horse, and a mask covered his face, while his
long, black hair flowed down on the collar of the coat he wore.He sat
the horse jauntily, riding with a reckless air that seemed to tell of a
daring spirit.Sandra went to the garden."An' it's your trate, me lad.""I will treat," said Frank, crestfallen."I am not nearly so smart as I
thought I was."cried Kate, dashing to the window.She did not hesitate to appear in the window and signal to the dashing
young moonshiner, who returned her salute, and motioned for her to come
out."He wants ter see me in er hurry," said the girl."I sent word ter him
by Dummy that ther boys war har, an' that's how he happened ter turn up.Come, Rufe, go out with me.Muriel will be glad to see yer.""And I shall be glad ter see him," declared the escaped convict.Kate bade the boys remain there, telling them she would call them if
they were wanted, and then, with Rufe following, she hurried down the
stairs, and hastened to meet the boy moonshiner, who had halted on the
bank at some distance from the old mill.Watching from the window, Frank and Barney saw her hasten up to Muriel,
saw her speak swiftly, although they could not hear her words, saw
Muriel nod and seem to reply quite as swiftly, and then saw the young
leader of the Black Caps shake her hand in a manner that denoted
pleasure and affection."Ye're a daisy, Frankie, me b'y," snickered Barney Mulloy; "but fer
wance ye wur badly mishtaken.""I was all of that," confessed Frank, as if slightly ashamed."I thought
myself far shrewder than I am."As they watched, they saw Rufe Kenyon suddenly leap up behind Muriel,
and then the doubly burdened horse swung around and went away at a hot
pace, while Kate came flitting back into the mill."The officers are returnin'," she explained."Muriel will take Rufe whar
thar ain't no chance o' their findin' him.You-uns will have ter stay
har.I have brung ye more fodder, an' I judge you'll git along all
right."So she left them hurriedly, being greatly excited over the return of her
brother and his danger.The day passed, and the officers failed to appear in the vicinity of the
mill, although the boys were expecting to see them.When night came Frank and Barney grew impatient, for they were far from
pleased with their lot, but they could do nothing but wait.Two hours after nightfall a form suddenly appeared in the old mill,
rising before the boys like a phantom, although they could not
understand how the fellow came there.In a flash Frank snatched out a revolver and pointed it at the intruder,
crying, sternly:

"Stand still and give an account of yourself!Who are you, and what do
you want?"The figure moved into the range of the window, so that the boys could
see him making strange gestures, pointing to his ears, and pressing his
fingers to his lips."If you don't keep still, I shall shoot.Still the intruder continued to make those strange gestures, pointing to
his ears, and touching his lips.That he saw Frank's revolver glittering
and feared the boy would shoot was evident, but he still remained
silent."Whoy don't th' spalpane spake?""Is it no tongue he has,
Oi dunno?""Perhaps he cannot speak, in which case he is the one Kate calls Dummy.It happened that the sign language of mutes was one of Frank's
accomplishments, he having taken it up during his leisure moments.He
passed the revolver to Barney, saying:

"Keep the fellow covered, while I see if I can talk with him."Frank moved up to the window, held his hands close to the intruder's
face, and spelled:

"You from Kate?"He put up his hands and spelled back:

"Kate send me.Frank interpreted for Barney's benefit, and the Irish lad cried:

"Thin let's be movin'!It's mesilf that's ready ter git out av thase
parruts in a hurry, Oi think."For a moment Frank hesitated about trusting the mute, and then he
decided that it was the best thing to do, and he signaled that they were
ready.Dummy led the way from the mill, crossing by the plank, and plunging
into the pine woods."He sames to be takin' us back th' woay we came, Frankie," said the
Irish lad, in a low tone."He said the horses were waiting for
us.The mute flitted along with surprising silence and speed, and they found
it no easy task to follow and keep close enough to see him.Now and then
he looked back to make sure they were close behind.At last they came to the termination of the pines, and there, in the
deep shadows, they found three horses waiting.Frank felt disappointed, for he wished to see the girl before leaving
the mountains forever.He did not like to go away without touching her
hand again, and expressing his sense of gratitude for the last time.It was his hope that she might join them before they left the mountains.The horses were saddled and bridled, and the boys were about to mount
when a strange, low cry broke from Dummy's lips.There was a sudden stir, and an uprising of dark forms on all sides.Frank tried to snatch out his revolver, but it was too late.He was
seized, disarmed, and crushed to the earth."Did you-uns think ye war goin'
ter escape?Wal, yer didn't know Wade Miller very well.I knowed Kate'd
try ter git yer off, an' all I hed ter do war watch her.I didn't waste
my time runnin' round elsewhar."They were once more in Miller's clutches!He blamed himself for falling
into the trap, and still he could not see how he was to blame.Surely he
had been cautious, but fate was against him.He had escaped Miller
twice; but this was the third time, and he feared that it would prove
disastrous.The hands of the captured boys were tied behind their backs, and then
they were forced to march swiftly along in the midst of the Black Caps
that surrounded them.They were not taken to the cave, but straight to one of the hidden
stills, a little hut that was built against what seemed to be a wall of
solid rock, a great bluff rising against the face of the mountain.Thick
trees concealed the little hut down in the hollow.Some crude candles were lighted, and they saw around them the outfit for
making moonshine whiskey.cried Miller, triumphantly; "you-uns will never go out o' this
place.Ther revernues spotted this still ter-day, but it won't be har
ter-morrer."He made a signal, and the boys were thrown to the floor, where they were
held helpless, while their feet were bound.When this job was finished Miller added:

"No, ther revernues won't find this still ter-morrer, fer it will go up
in smoke.Moonshine is good stuff ter burn, an' we'll see how you-uns
like it."At a word a keg of whiskey was brought to the spot by two men."Let 'em try ther stuff," directed Miller.he's goin' ter fill us up bafore he finishes us!"But that was not the intention of the revengeful man.A plug was knocked from a hole in the end of the keg, and then the
whiskey was poured over the clothing of the boys, wetting them to the
skin.The men did not stop pouring till the clothing of the boys was
thoroughly saturated.said Miller, with a fiendish chuckle, "I reckon you-uns is ready
fer touchin' off, an' ye'll burn like pine knots.Ther way ye'll holler
will make ye heard clean ter ther top o' Black Maounting, an' ther fire
will be seen; but when anybody gits har, you-uns an' this still will be
ashes."He knelt beside Frank, lighted a match, and applied it to the boy's
whiskey-soaked clothing!The flame almost touched Frank's clothing when the boy rolled
over swiftly, thus getting out of the way for the moment.At the same instant the blast of a bugle was heard at the very front of
the hut, and the door fell with a crash, while men poured in by the
opening.rang out a clear voice; "but Muriel!"The boy chief of the Black Caps was there."An' Muriel is not erlone!""Rufe Kenyon is
har!"Out in front of Muriel leaped the escaped criminal, confronting the man
who had betrayed him.Miller staggered, his face turning pale as if struck a heavy blow, and a
bitter exclamation of fury came through his clinched teeth.roared Kate Kenyon's brother, as a long-bladed knife
glittered in his hand, and he thrust back the sleeve of his shirt till
his arm was bared above the elbow."I swore ter finish yer, Miller; but
I'll give ye a squar' show!Draw yer knife, an' may ther best man win!"With the snarl that might have come from the throat of a savage beast,
Miller snatched out a revolver instead of drawing a knife.he screamed; "but I'll shoot ye plumb through ther
heart!"He fired, and Rufe Kenyon ducked at the same time.There was a scream of pain, and Muriel flung up both hands, dropping
into the arms of the man behind.Rufe Kenyon had dodged the bullet, but the boy chief of the Black Caps
had suffered in his stead.Miller seemed dazed by the result of his shot.The revolver fell from
his hand, and he staggered forward, groaning:

"Kate!--I've killed her!"Rufe Kenyon forgot his foe, dropping on one knee beside the prostrate
figure of Muriel, and swiftly removing the mask.panted her brother, "be ye dead?Her eyes opened, and she faintly said:

"Not dead yit, Rufe."Then the brother shouted:

"Ketch Wade Miller!It seemed that every man in the hut leaped to obey.Miller struggled like a tiger, but he was overpowered and dragged out of
the hut, while Rufe still knelt and examined his sister's wound, which
was in her shoulder.Frank and Barney were freed, and they hastened to render such assistance
as they could in dressing the wound and stanching the flow of blood."You-uns don't think that'll be fatal, do yer?"asked Rufe, with
breathless anxiety."There is no reason why it should," assured Frank."She must be taken
home as soon as possible, and a doctor called.I think she will come
through all right, for all of Miller's bullet."The men were trooping back into the hut.roared Rufe, leaping to his feet."He is out har under a tree," answered one of the men, quietly."Who's watchin' him ter see that he don't git erway?"Why, ther p'izen dog will run fer it!""I don't think he'll run fur."Wal, ter make sure he wouldn't run, we hitched a rope around his neck
an' tied it up ter ther limb o' ther tree.Unless ther rope stretches,
he won't be able ter git his feet down onter ther ground by erbout
eighteen inches."muttered Rufe, with a sad shake of his head."I wanted ter
squar 'counts with ther skunk."Kate Kenyon was taken home, and the bullet was extracted from her
shoulder.The wound, although painful, did not prove at all serious, and
she began to recover in a short time.Frank and Barney lingered until it seemed certain that she would
recover, and then they prepared to take their departure.After all, Frank's suspicion had proved true, and it had been revealed
that Muriel was Kate in disguise.Frank chaffed Barney a great deal about it, and the Irish lad took the
chaffing in a good-natured manner.Rufe Kenyon was hidden by his friends, so that his pursuers were forced
to give over the search for him and depart.One still was raided, but not one of the moonshiners was captured, as
they had received ample warning of their danger.On the evening before Frank and Barney were to depart in the morning,
the boys carried Kate out to the door in an easy-chair, and they sat
down near her.Kenyon sat on the steps and smoked her black pipe, looking as
stolid and indifferent as ever."Kate," said Frank, "when did you have your hair cut short?Where is
that profusion of beautiful hair you wore when we first saw you?""Why, my har war cut more'n a year ago.I had it
made inter a'switch,' and I wore it so nobody'd know I had it cut.""You did that in order that you might wear the black wig when you
personated Muriel?""You could do that easily over your short hair.""Well, you played the part well, and you made a dashing boy.But how
about the Muriel who appeared while you were in the mill with us?""You-uns war so sharp that I judged I'd make yer think ye didn't know
so much ez you thought, an' I fixed it up ter have another person show
up in my place."He is no bigger than I, an' he is a good mimic."It's mesilf thot wur chated, an'
thot's not aisy.""You are a shrewd little girl," declared Frank; "and you are dead lucky
to escape with your life after getting Miller's bullet.But Miller won't
trouble you more."Kenyon rose and went into the hut, while Barney lazily strolled
down to the creek, leaving Frank and Kate alone.Half an hour later, as he was coming back, the Irish lad heard Kate
saying:

"I know I'm igerent, an' I'm not fitten fer any educated man.Still, you
an' I is friends, Frank, an' friends we'll allus be.""Friends we will always be," said Frank, softly.It was not long before our friends left the locality, this time bound
for Oklahoma, Utah and California.What Frank's adventures were in those
places will be told in another volume, entitled, "Frank Merriwell's
Bravery.""We are well out of that," said Frank, as they journeyed away."To tell the whole thruth,
me b'y, ye're nivver wrong, nivver!"That emperor, who sways
The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice
Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
A giant, than the giants are in his arms.Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits
With such a part.If he were beautiful
As he is hideous now, and yet did dare
To scowl upon his Maker, well from him
May all our mis'ry flow.How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy
Upon his head three faces: one in front
Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this
Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;
The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left
To look on, such as come from whence old Nile
Stoops to the lowlands.Under each shot forth
Two mighty wings, enormous as became
A bird so vast.Sails never such I saw
Outstretch'd on the wide sea.No plumes had they,
But were in texture like a bat, and these
He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still
Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth
Was frozen.At six eyes he wept: the tears
Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd
Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three
Were in this guise tormented.But far more
Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd
By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back
Was stript of all its skin."That upper spirit,
Who hath worse punishment," so spake my guide,
"Is Judas, he that hath his head within
And plies the feet without.Of th' other two,
Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw
Who hangs, is Brutus: lo!how he doth writhe
And speaks not!Th' other Cassius, that appears
So large of limb.But night now re-ascends,
And it is time for parting.I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;
And noting time and place, he, when the wings
Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,
And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd
Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh
Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,
My leader there with pain and struggling hard
Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,
And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,
That into hell methought we turn'd again."Expect that by such stairs as these," thus spake
The teacher, panting like a man forespent,
"We must depart from evil so extreme."Then at a rocky opening issued forth,
And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd
With wary step my side.I rais'd mine eyes,
Believing that I Lucifer should see
Where he was lately left, but saw him now
With legs held upward.Let the grosser sort,
Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,
Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then."Arise," my master cried, "upon thy feet.The way is long, and much uncouth the road;
And now within one hour and half of noon
The sun returns."It was no palace-hall
Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,
But natural dungeon where ill footing was
And scant supply of light."Ere from th' abyss
I sep'rate," thus when risen I began,
"My guide!vouchsafe few words to set me free
From error's thralldom.How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?And how from eve to morn in space so brief
Hath the sun made his transit?"He in few
Thus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still
On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd
Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I
Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass
That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd
All heavy substance.Thou art now arriv'd
Under the hemisphere opposed to that,
Which the great continent doth overspread,
And underneath whose canopy expir'd
The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd.Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,
Whose other aspect is Judecca.Morn
Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,
Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,
As at the first.On this part he fell down
From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,
And to our hemisphere retir'd.Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears,
That sprang aloof."There is a place beneath,
From Belzebub as distant, as extends
The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,
But by the sound of brooklet, that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock,
Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,
The wave hath eaten.By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter, to return
To the fair world: and heedless of repose
We climbed, he first, I following his steps,
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.MAURICE

Father, it seems to me I hear voices.Listen--it sounds as
though they are crying there.Father, the
Prussians are crying._A distant, dull roaring of a crowd is heard.The searchlights are
swaying from side to side._

EMIL GRELIEU

It is they.DOCTOR

If we don't start in a quarter of an hour--

EMIL GRELIEU

In half an hour, Doctor.MAURICE

Father, how beautiful and how terrible it is!JEANNE

What is it?MAURICE

I want to kiss it.JEANNE

What a foolish little boy you are, Maurice.MAURICE

Monsieur Langloi said that in three days from now I may remove
my bandage.Just think of it, in three days I shall be able to
take up my gun again!...The
chauffeur and the doctor draw their revolvers.A figure appears
from the field, approaching from one of the ditches.A peasant,
wounded in the leg, comes up slowly, leaning upon a cane._

MAURICE

Who is there?PEASANT

Our own, our own.MAURICE

Yes, we're going to the city.Our car has broken down, we're
repairing it.PEASANT

What am I doing here?They also look at him
attentively, by the light of the lantern._

CHAUFFEUR

Give me the light!PEASANT

Are you carrying a wounded man?I
cannot walk, it is very hard.I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you
speak French I crawled out.DOCTOR

How were you wounded?PEASANT

I was walking in the field and they shot me.They must have
thought I was a rabbit._Laughs hoarsely._

They must have thought I was a rabbit.What is the news,
gentlemen?MAURICE

Don't you know?PEASANT

What can I know?I lay there and looked at the sky--that's all I
know.Just look at it, I have been watching
it all the time.What is that I see in the sky, eh?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down near us.MAURICE

Listen, sit down here.They are
crying there--the Prussians!They must have learned of
it by this time.Listen, it is so far, and yet we can hear!_The peasant laughs hoarsely._

MAURICE

Sit down, right here, the automobile is large.CHAUFFEUR

_Muttering._

Sit down, sit down!DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

What is it?MAURICE

What an unfortunate mishap!JEANNE

_Agitated._

They shot you like a rabbit?Do you hear, Emil--they thought a
rabbit was running!_She laughs loudly, the peasant also laughs._

PEASANT

I look like a rabbit!JEANNE

Do you hear, Emil?_Laughs._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

It makes me laugh--it seems so comical to me that they mistake
us for rabbits.And now, what are we now--water rats?Emil, just
picture to yourself, water rats in an automobile!JEANNE

No, no, I am not laughing any more, Maurice!_Laughs._

And what else are we?PEASANT

_Laughs._

And now we must hide in the ground--

JEANNE

_In the same tone._

And they will remain on the ground?EMIL GRELIEU

My dear!MAURICE

_To the doctor._

Listen, you must do something.Mamma, we are starting directly, my dear!JEANNE

No, never mind, I am not laughing any more.Maurice, I simply felt like talking.I
was forever silent, but just now I felt like chattering.Emil,
I am not disturbing you with my talk, am I?Why is the water so
quiet, Emil?It was the King who said, "The water is silent,"
was it not?But I should like to see it roar, crash like
thunder.... No, I cannot, I cannot bear this silence!Ah, why is
it so quiet--I cannot bear it!MAURICE

_To the chauffeur._

My dear fellow, please hurry up!CHAUFFEUR

Yes, yes!JEANNE

_Suddenly cries, threatening._

But I cannot bear it!_Covers her mouth with her hands; sobs._

I cannot!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne.JEANNE

_Sobbing, but calming herself somewhat._

I cannot bear it!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne!I am suffering, but I know this, Jeanne!CHAUFFEUR

In a moment, in a moment.EMIL GRELIEU

_Faintly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

Yes, yes, I know.... Forgive me, forgive me, I will soon--

_A loud, somewhat hoarse voice of a girl comes from the dark._

GIRL

Tell me how I can find my way to Lonua!_Exclamations of surprise._

MAURICE

Who is that?JEANNE

Emil, it is that girl!_Laughs._

She is also like a rabbit!DOCTOR

_Grumbles._

What is it, what is it--Who?Her dress is torn, her eyes look
wild.The peasant is laughing._

PEASANT

She is here again?CHAUFFEUR

Let me have the light!GIRL

_Loudly._

How can I find my way to Lonua?EMIL GRELIEU

Maurice, you must stop her!Doctor, you--

CHAUFFEUR

Put down the lantern!GIRL

_Shouts._

Hands off!No, no, you will not dare--

MAURICE

You can't catch her--

_The girl runs away._

EMIL GRELIEU

Doctor, you must catch her!She will perish here, quick--

_She runs away.The doctor follows her in the dark._

PEASANT

She asked me, too, how to go to Lonua._The girl's voice resounds in the dark and then there is
silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

You must catch her!MAURICE

But how, father?Jeanne
breaks into muffled laughter._

MAURICE

_Mutters._

Now he is gone!CHAUFFEUR

_Triumphantly._

Take your seats!MAURICE

But the doctor isn't here.CHAUFFEUR

Let us call him._Maurice and the chauffeur call: "Doctor!"_

CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

I must deliver Monsieur Grelieu, and I will deliver him.MAURICE

_Shouts._

Langloi!_A faint echo in the distance._

Come!_The response is nearer._

PEASANT

He did not catch her.She asked me, too,
about the road to Lonua._Laughs._

There are many like her now.EMIL GRELIEU

_Imploringly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

But I cannot, Emil.I used
to understand, I used to understand, but now--Where is Pierre?_Firmly._

Where is Pierre?MAURICE

Oh, will he be here soon?Mother dear, we'll start in a moment!JEANNE

Yes, yes, we'll start in a moment!Why such a dream, why such a dream?_A mice from the darkness, quite near._

JEANNE

_Frightened._

Who is shouting?What a strange dream, what a terrible,
terrible, terrible dream._Lowering her voice._

I cannot--why are you torturing me?EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne!EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne.But I swear to you by God, Jeanne!--Belgium
will live.Weep, sob, you are a mother.I too am crying with
you--But I swear by God: Belgium will live!God has given me the
light to see, and I can see.A new Spring will come here, the trees will be covered with
blossoms--I swear to you, Jeanne, they will be covered with
blossoms!And mothers will caress their children, and the sun
will shine upon their heads, upon their golden-haired little
heads!I see my nation: Here it is advancing with palm
leaves to meet God who has come to earth again.Weep, Jeanne,
you are a mother!Weep, unfortunate mother--God weeps with you.But there will be happy mothers here again--I see a new world,
Jeanne, I see a new life!Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife!To all the sensual world proclaim,
               One crowded hour of glorious life
               Is worth an age without a name.When the desperate affray had ceased, Claverhouse commanded his soldiers
to remove the dead bodies, to refresh themselves and their horses, and
prepare for passing the night at the farm-house, and for marching early
in the ensuing morning.He then turned his attention to Morton, and there
was politeness, and even kindness, in the manner in which he addressed
him."You would have saved yourself risk from both sides, Mr Morton, if you
had honoured my counsel yesterday morning with some attention; but I
respect your motives.You are a prisoner-of-war at the disposal of the
king and council, but you shall be treated with no incivility; and I will
be satisfied with your parole that you will not attempt an escape."When Morton had passed his word to that effect, Claverhouse bowed
civilly, and, turning away from him, called for his sergeant-major."How many prisoners, Halliday, and how many killed?""Three killed in the house, sir, two cut down in the court, and one in
the garden--six in all; four prisoners.""Three of them armed to the teeth," answered Halliday; "one without
arms--he seems to be a preacher.""Ay--the trumpeter to the long-ear'd rout, I suppose," replied
Claverhouse, glancing slightly round upon his victims, "I will talk with
him tomorrow.Take the other three down to the yard, draw out two files,
and fire upon them; and, d'ye hear, make a memorandum in the orderly book
of three rebels taken in arms and shot, with the date and name of the
place--Drumshinnel, I think, they call it.--Look after the preacher till
to-morrow; as he was not armed, he must undergo a short examination.Or
better, perhaps, take him before the Privy Council; I think they should
relieve me of a share of this disgusting drudgery.--Let Mr Morton be
civilly used, and see that the men look well after their horses; and let
my groom wash Wild-blood's shoulder with some vinegar, the saddle has
touched him a little."All these various orders,--for life and death, the securing of his
prisoners, and the washing his charger's shoulder,--were given in the
same unmoved and equable voice, of which no accent or tone intimated that
the speaker considered one direction as of more importance than another.The Cameronians, so lately about to be the willing agents of a bloody
execution, were now themselves to undergo it.They seemed prepared alike
for either extremity, nor did any of them show the least sign of fear,
when ordered to leave the room for the purpose of meeting instant death.Their severe enthusiasm sustained them in that dreadful moment, and they
departed with a firm look and in silence, excepting that one of them, as
he left the apartment, looked Claverhouse full in the face, and
pronounced, with a stern and steady voice,--"Mischief shall haunt the
violent man!"to which Grahame only answered by a smile of contempt.They had no sooner left the room than Claverhouse applied himself to some
food, which one or two of his party had hastily provided, and invited
Morton to follow his example, observing, it had been a busy day for them
both.Morton declined eating; for the sudden change of circumstances--the
transition from the verge of the grave to a prospect of life, had
occasioned a dizzy revulsion in his whole system.But the same confused
sensation was accompanied by a burning thirst, and he expressed his wish
to drink."I will pledge you, with all my heart," said Claverhouse; "for here is a
black jack full of ale, and good it must be, if there be good in the
country, for the whigs never miss to find it out.--My service to you, Mr
Morton," he said, filling one horn of ale for himself, and handing
another to his prisoner.Morton raised it to his head, and was just about to drink, when the
discharge of carabines beneath the window, followed by a deep and hollow
groan, repeated twice or thrice, and more faint at each interval,
announced the fate of the three men who had just left them.Morton
shuddered, and set down the untasted cup."You are but young in these matters, Mr Morton," said Claverhouse, after
he had very composedly finished his draught; "and I do not think the
worse of you as a young soldier for appearing to feel them acutely.But
habit, duty, and necessity, reconcile men to every thing.""I trust," said Morton, "they will never reconcile me to such scenes as
these.""You would hardly believe," said Claverhouse in reply, "that, in the
beginning of my military career, I had as much aversion to seeing blood
spilt as ever man felt; it seemed to me to be wrung from my own heart;
and yet, if you trust one of those whig fellows, he will tell you I drink
a warm cup of it every morning before I breakfast.[Note: The author is
uncertain whether this was ever said of Claverhouse.But it was currently
reported of Sir Robert Grierson of Lagg, another of the persecutors, that
a cup of wine placed in his hand turned to clotted blood.]But in truth,
Mr Morton, why should we care so much for death, light upon us or around
us whenever it may?Men die daily--not a bell tolls the hour but it is
the death-note of some one or other; and why hesitate to shorten the span
of others, or take over-anxious care to prolong our own?It is all a
lottery--when the hour of midnight came, you were to die--it has struck,
you are alive and safe, and the lot has fallen on those fellows who were
to murder you.It is not the expiring pang that is worth thinking of in
an event that must happen one day, and may befall us on any given
moment--it is the memory which the soldier leaves behind him, like the
long train of light that follows the sunken sun--that is all which is
worth caring for, which distinguishes the death of the brave or the
ignoble.When I think of death, Mr Morton, as a thing worth thinking of,
it is in the hope of pressing one day some well-fought and hard-won
field of battle, and dying with the shout of victory in my ear--that
would be worth dying for, and more, it would be worth having lived for!"At the moment when Grahame delivered these sentiments, his eye glancing
with the martial enthusiasm which formed such a prominent feature in his
character, a gory figure, which seemed to rise out of the floor of the
apartment, stood upright before him, and presented the wild person and
hideous features of the maniac so often mentioned.His face, where it was
not covered with blood-streaks, was ghastly pale, for the hand of death
was on him.He bent upon Claverhouse eyes, in which the grey light of
insanity still twinkled, though just about to flit for ever, and
exclaimed, with his usual wildness of ejaculation, "Wilt thou trust in
thy bow and in thy spear, in thy steed and in thy banner?And shall not
God visit thee for innocent blood?--Wilt thou glory in thy wisdom, and in
thy courage, and in thy might?And shall not the Lord judge thee?--Behold
the princes, for whom thou hast sold thy soul to the destroyer, shall be
removed from their place, and banished to other lands, and their names
shall be a desolation, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a curse.And thou, who hast partaken of the wine-cup of fury, and hast been
drunken and mad because thereof, the wish of thy heart shall be granted
to thy loss, and the hope of thine own pride shall destroy thee.I summon
thee, John Grahame, to appear before the tribunal of God, to answer for
this innocent blood, and the seas besides which thou hast shed."He drew his right hand across his bleeding face, and held it up to heaven
as he uttered these words, which he spoke very loud, and then added more
faintly, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge
the blood of thy saints!"As he uttered the last word, he fell backwards without an attempt to save
himself, and was a dead man ere his head touched the floor.Morton was much shocked at this extraordinary scene, and the prophecy of
the dying man, which tallied so strangely with the wish which Claverhouse
had just expressed; and he often thought of it afterwards when that wish
seemed to be accomplished.Two of the dragoons who were in the apartment,
hardened as they were, and accustomed to such scenes, showed great
consternation at the sudden apparition, the event, and the words which
preceded it.At the first instant of
Mucklewrath's appearance, he had put his hand to his pistol, but on
seeing the situation of the wounded wretch, he immediately withdrew it,
and listened with great composure to his dying exclamation.When he dropped, Claverhouse asked, in an unconcerned tone of voice--"How
came the fellow here?--Speak, you staring fool!"he added, addressing the
nearest dragoon, "unless you would have me think you such a poltroon as
to fear a dying man."The dragoon crossed himself, and replied with a faltering voice,--"That
the dead fellow had escaped their notice when they removed the other
bodies, as he chanced to have fallen where a cloak or two had been flung
aside, and covered him.""Take him away now, then, you gaping idiot, and see that he does not bite
you, to put an old proverb to shame.--This is a new incident, Mr.Morton,
that dead men should rise and push us from our stools.I must see that my
blackguards grind their swords sharper; they used not to do their work so
slovenly.--But we have had a busy day; they are tired, and their blades
blunted with their bloody work; and I suppose you, Mr Morton, as well as
I, are well disposed for a few hours' repose."So saying, he yawned, and taking a candle which a soldier had placed
ready, saluted Morton courteously, and walked to the apartment which had
been prepared for him.Morton was also accommodated, for the evening, with a separate room.Being left alone, his first occupation was the returning thanks to Heaven
for redeeming him from danger, even through the instrumentality of those
who seemed his most dangerous enemies; he also prayed sincerely for the
Divine assistance in guiding his course through times which held out so
many dangers and so many errors.And having thus poured out his spirit in
prayer before the Great Being who gave it, he betook himself to the
repose which he so much required.The charge is prepared, the lawyers are met,
               The judges all ranged--a terrible show!So deep was the slumber which succeeded the agitation and embarrassment
of the preceding day, that Morton hardly knew where he was when it was
broken by the tramp of horses, the hoarse voice of men, and the wild
sound of the trumpets blowing the _reveille_.The sergeant-major
immediately afterwards came to summon him, which he did in a very
respectful manner, saying the General (for Claverhouse now held that
rank) hoped for the pleasure of his company upon the road.In some
situations an intimation is a command, and Morton considered that the
present occasion was one of these.He waited upon Claverhouse as speedily
as he could, found his own horse saddled for his use, and Cuddie in
attendance.Both were deprived of their fire-arms, though they seemed,
otherwise, rather to make part of the troop than of the prisoners; and
Morton was permitted to retain his sword, the wearing which was, in those
days, the distinguishing mark of a gentleman.Claverhouse seemed also to
take pleasure in riding beside him, in conversing with him, and in
confounding his ideas when he attempted to appreciate his real character.The gentleness and urbanity of that officer's general manners, the high
and chivalrous sentiments of military devotion which he occasionally
expressed, his deep and accurate insight into the human bosom, demanded
at once the approbation and the wonder of those who conversed with him;
while, on the other hand, his cold indifference to military violence and
cruelty seemed altogether inconsistent with the social, and even
admirable qualities which he displayed.Morton could not help, in his
heart, contrasting him with Balfour of Burley; and so deeply did the idea
impress him, that he dropped a hint of it as they rode together at some
distance from the troop."You are right," said Claverhouse, with a smile; "you are very right--we
are both fanatics; but there is some distinction between the fanaticism
of honour and that of dark and sullen superstition.""Yet you both shed blood without mercy or remorse," said Morton, who
could not suppress his feelings."Surely," said Claverhouse, with the same composure; "but of what
kind?--There is a difference, I trust, between the blood of learned and
reverend prelates and scholars, of gallant soldiers and noble gentlemen,
and the red puddle that stagnates in the veins of psalm-singing
mechanics, crackbrained demagogues, and sullen boors;--some distinction,
in short, between spilling a flask of generous wine, and dashing down a
can full of base muddy ale?""Your distinction is too nice for my comprehension," replied Morton."God
gives every spark of life--that of the peasant as well as of the prince;
and those who destroy his work recklessly or causelessly, must answer in
either case.What right, for example, have I to General Grahame's
protection now, more than when I first met him?""And narrowly escaped the consequences, you would say?"answered
Claverhouse--"why, I will answer you frankly.Then I thought I had to do
with the son of an old roundheaded rebel, and the nephew of a sordid
presbyterian laird; now I know your points better, and there is that
about you which I respect in an enemy as much as I like in a friend.I
have learned a good deal concerning you since our first meeting, and I
trust that you have found that my construction of the information has not
been unfavourable to you.""But yet," said Morton--

"But yet," interrupted Grahame, taking up the word, "you would say you
were the same when I first met you that you are now?True; but then, how
could I know that?though, by the by, even my reluctance to suspend your
execution may show you how high your abilities stood in my estimation.""Do you expect, General," said Morton, "that I ought to be particularly
grateful for such a mark of your esteem?""I tell you I thought
you a different sort of person."I have half a mind," said Claverhouse, "to contrive you should have six
months' imprisonment in order to procure you that pleasure.His chapters
inspire me with more enthusiasm than even poetry itself.And the noble
canon, with what true chivalrous feeling he confines his beautiful
expressions of sorrow to the death of the gallant and high-bred knight,
of whom it was a pity to see the fall, such was his loyalty to his king,
pure faith to his religion, hardihood towards his enemy, and fidelity to
his lady-love!--Ah, benedicite!how he will mourn over the fall of such a
pearl of knighthood, be it on the side he happens to favour, or on the
other.But, truly, for sweeping from the face of the earth some few
hundreds of villain churls, who are born but to plough it, the high-born
and inquisitive historian has marvellous little sympathy,--as little, or
less, perhaps, than John Grahame of Claverhouse.""There is one ploughman in your possession, General, for whom," said
Morton, "in despite of the contempt in which you hold a profession which
some philosophers have considered as useful as that of a soldier, I would
humbly request your favour.""You mean," said Claverhouse, looking at a memorandum book, "one
Hatherick--Hedderick--or--or--Headrigg.Ay, Cuthbert, or Cuddie
Headrigg--here I have him.O, never fear him, if he will be but
tractable.The ladies of Tillietudlem made interest with me on his
account some time ago.He is to marry their waiting-maid, I think.He
will be allowed to slip off easy, unless his obstinacy spoils his good
fortune.""He has no ambition to be a martyr, I believe," said Morton."'Tis the better for him," said Claverhouse."But, besides, although the
fellow had more to answer for, I should stand his friend, for the sake of
the blundering gallantry which threw him into the midst of our ranks last
night, when seeking assistance for you.I never desert any man who trusts
me with such implicit confidence.But, to deal sincerely with you, he has
been long in our eye.--Here, Halliday; bring me up the black book."The sergeant, having committed to his commander this ominous record of
the disaffected, which was arranged in alphabetical order, Claverhouse,
turning over the leaves as he rode on, began to read names as they
occurred."Gumblegumption, a minister, aged 50, indulged, close, sly, and so
forth--Pooh!pooh!--He--He--I have him here--Heathercat; outlawed--a
preacher--a zealous Cameronian--keeps a conventicle among the Campsie
hills--Tush!--O, here is Headrigg--Cuthbert; his mother a bitter
puritan--himself a simple fellow--like to be forward in action, but of
no genius for plots--more for the hand than the head, and might be drawn
to the right side, but for his attachment to"--(Here Claverhouse looked
at Morton, and then shut the book and changed his tone.)"Faithful and
true are words never thrown away upon me, Mr Morton.You may depend on
the young man's safety.""Does it not revolt a mind like yours," said Morton, "to follow a system
which is to be supported by such minute enquiries after obscure
individuals?""You do not suppose we take the trouble?""The curates, for their own sakes, willingly collect all these materials
for their own regulation in each parish; they know best the black sheep
of the flock."Will you favour me by imparting it?""Willingly," said Claverhouse; "it can signify little, for you cannot
avenge yourself on the curate, as you will probably leave Scotland for
some time."Morton felt an involuntary
shudder at hearing words which implied a banishment from his native land;
but ere he answered, Claverhouse proceeded to read, "Henry Morton, son of
Silas Morton, Colonel of horse for the Scottish Parliament, nephew and
apparent heir of Morton of Milnwood--imperfectly educated, but with
spirit beyond his years--excellent at all exercises--indifferent to forms
of religion, but seems to incline to the presbyterian--has high-flown and
dangerous notions about liberty of thought and speech, and hovers between
a latitudinarian and an enthusiast.Much admired and followed by the
youth of his own age--modest, quiet, and unassuming in manner, but in his
heart peculiarly bold and intractable.He is--Here follow three red
crosses, Mr Morton, which signify triply dangerous.You see how important
a person you are.--But what does this fellow want?"A horseman rode up as he spoke, and gave a letter.Claverhouse glanced it
over, laughed scornfully, bade him tell his master to send his prisoners
to Edinburgh, for there was no answer; and, as the man turned back, said
contemptuously to Morton--"Here is an ally of yours deserted from you, or
rather, I should say, an ally of your good friend Burley--Hear how he
sets forth--'Dear Sir,' (I wonder when we were such intimates,)'may it
please your Excellency to accept my humble congratulations on the
victory'--hum--hum--'blessed his Majesty's army.I pray you to understand
I have my people under arms to take and intercept all fugitives, and have
already several prisoners,' and so forth.Subscribed Basil Olifant--You
know the fellow by name, I suppose?""A relative of Lady Margaret Bellenden," replied Morton, "is he not?""Ay," replied Grahame, "and heir-male of her father's family, though a
distant one, and moreover a suitor to the fair Edith, though discarded as
an unworthy one; but, above all, a devoted admirer of the estate of
Tillietudlem, and all thereunto belonging.""He takes an ill mode of recommending himself," said Morton, suppressing
his feelings, "to the family at Tillietudlem, by corresponding with our
unhappy party.""O, this precious Basil will turn cat in pan with any man!""He was displeased with the government, because they would
not overturn in his favour a settlement of the late Earl of Torwood, by
which his lordship gave his own estate to his own daughter; he was
displeased with Lady Margaret, because she avowed no desire for his
alliance, and with the pretty Edith, because she did not like his tall
ungainly person.So he held a close correspondence with Burley, and
raised his followers with the purpose of helping him, providing always he
needed no help, that is, if you had beat us yesterday.And now the rascal
pretends he was all the while proposing the King's service, and, for
aught I know, the council will receive his pretext for current coin, for
he knows how to make friends among them--and a dozen scores of poor
vagabond fanatics will be shot, or hanged, while this cunning scoundrel
lies hid under the double cloak of loyalty, well-lined with the fox-fur
of hypocrisy."With conversation on this and other matters they beguiled the way,
Claverhouse all the while speaking with great frankness to Morton, and
treating him rather as a friend and companion than as a prisoner; so
that, however uncertain of his fate, the hours he passed in the company
of this remarkable man were so much lightened by the varied play of his
imagination, and the depth of his knowledge of human nature, that since
the period of his becoming a prisoner of war, which relieved him at once
from the cares of his doubtful and dangerous station among the
insurgents, and from the consequences of their suspicious resentment, his
hours flowed on less anxiously than at any time since his having
commenced actor in public life.He was now, with respect to his fortune,
like a rider who has flung his reins on the horse's neck, and, while he
abandoned himself to circumstances, was at least relieved from the task
of attempting to direct them.In this mood he journeyed on, the number of
his companions being continually augmented by detached parties of horse
who came in from every quarter of the country, bringing with them, for
the most part, the unfortunate persons who had fallen into their power."Our council," said Claverhouse, "being resolved, I suppose, to testify
by their present exultation the extent of their former terror, have
decreed a kind of triumphal entry to us victors and our captives; but as
I do not quite approve the taste of it, I am willing to avoid my own part
in the show, and, at the same time, to save you from yours."So saying, he gave up the command of the forces to Allan, (now a
Lieutenant-colonel,) and, turning his horse into a by-lane, rode into the
city privately, accompanied by Morton and two or three servants.When
Claverhouse arrived at the quarters which he usually occupied in the
Canongate, he assigned to his prisoner a small apartment, with an
intimation, that his parole confined him to it for the present.After about a quarter of an hour spent in solitary musing on the strange
vicissitudes of his late life, the attention of Morton was summoned to
the window by a great noise in the street beneath.Trumpets, drums, and
kettle-drums, contended in noise with the shouts of a numerous rabble,
and apprised him that the royal cavalry were passing in the triumphal
attitude which Claverhouse had mentioned.The magistrates of the city,
attended by their guard of halberds, had met the victors with their
welcome at the gate of the city, and now preceded them as a part of the
procession.The next object was two heads borne upon pikes; and before
each bloody head were carried the hands of the dismembered sufferers,
which were, by the brutal mockery of those who bore them, often
approached towards each other as if in the attitude of exhortation or
prayer.These bloody trophies belonged to two preachers who had fallen at
Bothwell Bridge.After them came a cart led by the executioner's
assistant, in which were placed Macbriar, and other two prisoners, who
seemed of the same profession.They were bareheaded, and strongly bound,
yet looked around them with an air rather of triumph than dismay, and
appeared in no respect moved either by the fate of their companions, of
which the bloody evidences were carried before them, or by dread of their
own approaching execution, which these preliminaries so plainly
indicated.Behind these prisoners, thus held up to public infamy and derision, came
a body of horse, brandishing their broadswords, and filling the wide
street with acclamations, which were answered by the tumultuous outcries
and shouts of the rabble, who, in every considerable town, are too happy
in being permitted to huzza for any thing whatever which calls them
together.In the rear of these troopers came the main body of the
prisoners, at the head of whom were some of their leaders, who were
treated with every circumstance of inventive mockery and insult.Several
were placed on horseback with their faces to the animal's tail; others
were chained to long bars of iron, which they were obliged to support in
their hands, like the galleyslaves in Spain when travelling to the port
where they are to be put on shipboard.The heads of others who had fallen
were borne in triumph before the survivors, some on pikes and halberds,
some in sacks, bearing the names of the slaughtered persons labelled on
the outside.Such were the objects who headed the ghastly procession, who
seemed as effectually doomed to death as if they wore the sanbenitos of
the condemned heretics in an auto-da-fe.[Note: David Hackston of
Rathillet, who was wounded and made prisoner in the skirmish of
Air's-Moss, in which the celebrated Cameron fell, was, on entering
Edinburgh, "by order of the Council, received by the Magistrates at the
Watergate, and set on a horse's bare back with his face to the tail, and
the other three laid on a goad of iron, and carried up the street, Mr
Cameron's head being on a halberd before them."]Behind them came on the nameless crowd to the number of several hundreds,
some retaining under their misfortunes a sense of confidence in the cause
for which they suffered captivity, and were about to give a still more
bloody testimony; others seemed pale, dispirited, dejected, questioning
in their own minds their prudence in espousing a cause which Providence
seemed to have disowned, and looking about for some avenue through which
they might escape from the consequences of their rashness.Others there
were who seemed incapable of forming an opinion on the subject, or of
entertaining either hope, confidence, or fear, but who, foaming with
thirst and fatigue, stumbled along like over-driven oxen, lost to every
thing but their present sense of wretchedness, and without having any
distinct idea whether they were led to the shambles or to the pasture.These unfortunate men were guarded on each hand by troopers, and behind
them came the main body of the cavalry, whose military music resounded
back from the high houses on each side of the street, and mingled with
their own songs of jubilee and triumph, and the wild shouts of the
rabble.Morton felt himself heart-sick while he gazed on the dismal spectacle,
and recognised in the bloody heads, and still more miserable and agonized
features of the living sufferers, faces which had been familiar to him
during the brief insurrection.He sunk down in a chair in a bewildered
and stupified state, from which he was awakened by the voice of Cuddie.said the poor fellow, his teeth chattering like a
pair of nut-crackers, his hair erect like boar's bristles, and his face
as pale as that of a corpse--"Lord forgie us, sir!we maun instantly gang
before the Council!--O Lord, what made them send for a puir bodie like
me, sae mony braw lords and gentles!--and there's my mither come on the
lang tramp frae Glasgow to see to gar me testify, as she ca's it, that is
to say, confess and be hanged; but deil tak me if they mak sic a guse o'
Cuddie, if I can do better.But here's Claverhouse himsell--the Lord
preserve and forgie us, I say anes mair!""You must immediately attend the Council Mr Morton," said Claverhouse,
who entered while Cuddie spoke, "and your servant must go with you.You
need be under no apprehension for the consequences to yourself
personally.But I warn you that you will see something that will give you
much pain, and from which I would willingly have saved you, if I had
possessed the power.It will be readily supposed that Morton did not venture to dispute this
invitation, however unpleasant."I must apprise you," said the latter, as he led the way down stairs,
"that you will get off cheap; and so will your servant, provided he can
keep his tongue quiet."Cuddie caught these last words to his exceeding joy."Deil a fear o' me," said he, "an my mither disna pit her finger in the
pie."At that moment his shoulder was seized by old Mause, who had contrived to
thrust herself forward into the lobby of the apartment."O, hinny, hinny!"said she to Cuddie, hanging upon his neck, "glad and
proud, and sorry and humbled am I, a'in ane and the same instant, to see
my bairn ganging to testify for the truth gloriously with his mouth in
council, as he did with his weapon in the field!""Whisht, whisht, mither!""Odd, ye daft wife,
is this a time to speak o' thae things?I tell ye I'll testify naething
either ae gate or another.I hae spoken to Mr Poundtext, and I'll tak the
declaration, or whate'er they ca'it, and we're a' to win free off if we
do that--he's gotten life for himsell and a' his folk, and that's a
minister for my siller; I like nane o' your sermons that end in a psalm
at the Grassmarket."[Note: Then the place of public execution.]"O, Cuddie, man, laith wad I be they suld hurt ye," said old Mause,
divided grievously between the safety of her son's soul and that of his
body; "but mind, my bonny bairn, ye hae battled for the faith, and dinna
let the dread o' losing creature-comforts withdraw ye frae the gude
fight.""Hout tout, mither," replied Cuddie, "I hae fought e'en ower muckle
already, and, to speak plain, I'm wearied o'the trade.I hae swaggered
wi' a' thae arms, and muskets, and pistols, buffcoats, and bandoliers,
lang eneugh, and I like the pleughpaidle a hantle better.I ken naething
suld gar a man fight, (that's to say, when he's no angry,) by and
out-taken the dread o'being hanged or killed if he turns back.""But, my dear Cuddie," continued the persevering Mause, "your bridal
garment--Oh, hinny, dinna sully the marriage garment!""Awa, awa, mither," replied.Cuddie; "dinna ye see the folks waiting for
me?--Never fear me--I ken how to turn this far better than ye do--for
ye're bleezing awa about marriage, and the job is how we are to win by
hanging."So saying, he extricated himself out of his mother's embraces, and
requested the soldiers who took him in charge to conduct him to the place
of examination without delay.He had been already preceded by Claverhouse
and Morton.The Privy Council of Scotland, in whom the practice since the union of
the crowns vested great judicial powers, as well as the general
superintendence of the executive department, was met in the ancient dark
Gothic room, adjoining to the House of Parliament in Edinburgh, when
General Grahame entered and took his place amongst the members at the
council table."You have brought us a leash of game to-day, General," said a nobleman of
high place amongst them."Here is a craven to confess--a cock of the game
to stand at bay--and what shall I call the third, General?""Without further metaphor, I will entreat your Grace to call him a person
in whom I am specially interested," replied Claverhouse.said the nobleman, lolling out a tongue
which was at all times too big for his mouth, and accommodating his
coarse features to a sneer, to which they seemed to be familiar."Yes, please your Grace, a whig; as your Grace was in 1641," replied
Claverhouse, with his usual appearance of imperturbable civility."He has you there, I think, my Lord Duke," said one of the Privy
Councillors."Ay, ay," returned the Duke, laughing, "there's no speaking to him since
Drumclog--but come, bring in the prisoners--and do you, Mr Clerk, read
the record."The clerk read forth a bond, in which General Grahame of Claverhouse and
Lord Evandale entered themselves securities, that Henry Morton, younger
of Milnwood, should go abroad and remain in foreign parts, until his
Majesty's pleasure was further known, in respect of the said Henry
Morton's accession to the late rebellion, and that under penalty of life
and limb to the said Henry Morton, and of ten thousand marks to each of
his securities."Do you accept of the King's mercy upon these terms, Mr Morton?"said the
Duke of Lauderdale, who presided in the Council."I have no other choice, my lord," replied Morton.Morton did so without reply, conscious that, in the circumstances of his
case, it was impossible for him to have escaped more easily.Macbriar,
who was at the same instant brought to the foot of the council-table,
bound upon a chair, for his weakness prevented him from standing, beheld
Morton in the act of what he accounted apostasy."He hath summed his defection by owning the carnal power of the tyrant!"he exclaimed, with a deep groan--"A fallen star!--a fallen star!""Hold your peace, sir," said the Duke, "and keep your ain breath to cool
your ain porridge--ye'll find them scalding hot, I promise you.--Call in
the other fellow, who has some common sense.One sheep will leap the
ditch when another goes first."Cuddie was introduced unbound, but under the guard of two halberdiers,
and placed beside Macbriar at the foot of the table.The poor fellow cast
a piteous look around him, in which were mingled awe for the great men in
whose presence he stood, and compassion for his fellow-sufferers, with no
small fear of the personal consequences which impended over himself.He
made his clownish obeisances with a double portion of reverence, and then
awaited the opening of the awful scene."Were you at the battle of Bothwell Brigg?"was the first question which
was thundered in his ears.Cuddie meditated a denial, but had sense enough, upon reflection, to
discover that the truth would be too strong for him; so he replied, with
true Caledonian indirectness of response, "I'll no say but it may be
possible that I might hae been there.""Answer directly, you knave--yes, or no?--You know you were there.""It's no for me to contradict your Lordship's Grace's honour," said
Cuddie."Once more, sir, were you there?--yes, or no?""Dear stir," again replied Cuddie, "how can ane mind preceesely where
they hae been a' the days o' their life?""Speak out, you scoundrel," said General Dalzell, "or I'll dash your
teeth out with my dudgeonhaft!--Do you think we can stand here all day to
be turning and dodging with you, like greyhounds after a hare?"[Note:
The General is said to have struck one of the captive whigs, when under
examination, with the hilt of his sabre, so that the blood gushed out.The provocation for this unmanly violence was, that the prisoner had
called the fierce veteran "a Muscovy beast, who used to roast men."Dalzell had been long in the Russian service, which in those days was no
school of humanity.]"Aweel, then," said Cuddie, "since naething else will please ye, write
down that I cannot deny but I was there.""Well, sir," said the Duke, "and do you think that the rising upon that
occasion was rebellion or not?""I'm no just free to gie my opinion, stir," said the cautious captive,
"on what might cost my neck; but I doubt it will be very little better.""Just than rebellion, as your honour ca's it," replied Cuddie."Well, sir, that's speaking to the purpose," replied his Grace."And are
you content to accept of the King's pardon for your guilt as a rebel, and
to keep the church, and pray for the King?""Blithely, stir," answered the unscrupulous Cuddie; "and drink his health
into the bargain, when the ale's gude.""Egad," said the Duke, "this is a hearty cock.--What brought you into
such a scrape, mine honest friend?""Just ill example, stir," replied the prisoner, "and a daft auld jaud of
a mither, wi' reverence to your Grace's honour.""Why, God-a-mercy, my friend," replied the Duke, "take care of bad advice
another time; I think you are not likely to commit treason on your own
score.--Make out his free pardon, and bring forward the rogue in the
chair."Macbriar was then moved forward to the post of examination."Were you at the battle of Bothwell Bridge?"was, in like manner,
demanded of him."I was," answered the prisoner, in a bold and resolute tone."I was not--I went in my calling as a preacher of God's word, to
encourage them that drew the sword in His cause.""In other words, to aid and abet the rebels?""Thou hast spoken it," replied the prisoner."Well, then," continued the interrogator, "let us know if you saw John
Balfour of Burley among the party?--I presume you know him?""I bless God that I do know him," replied Macbriar; "he is a zealous and
a sincere Christian.""And when and where did you last see this pious personage?""I am here to answer for myself," said Macbriar, in the same dauntless
manner, "and not to endanger others.""We shall know," said Dalzell, "how to make you find your tongue.""If you can make him fancy himself in a conventicle," answered
Lauderdale, "he will find it without you.--Come, laddie, speak while the
play is good--you're too young to bear the burden will be laid on you
else.""I defy you," retorted Macbriar."This has not been the first of my
imprisonments or of my sufferings; and, young as I may be, I have lived
long enough to know how to die when I am called upon.""Ay, but there are some things which must go before an easy death, if you
continue obstinate," said Lauderdale, and rung a small silver bell which
was placed before him on the table.A dark crimson curtain, which covered a sort of niche, or Gothic recess
in the wall, rose at the signal, and displayed the public executioner, a
tall, grim, and hideous man, having an oaken table before him, on which
lay thumb-screws, and an iron case, called the Scottish boot, used in
those tyrannical days to torture accused persons.Morton, who was
unprepared for this ghastly apparition, started when the curtain arose,
but Macbriar's nerves were more firm.He gazed upon the horrible
apparatus with much composure; and if a touch of nature called the blood
from his cheek for a second, resolution sent it back to his brow with
greater energy.said Lauderdale, in a low, stern voice,
almost sinking into a whisper."He is, I suppose," replied Macbriar, "the infamous executioner of your
bloodthirsty commands upon the persons of God's people.He and you are
equally beneath my regard; and, I bless God, I no more fear what he can
inflict than what you can command.Flesh and blood may shrink under the
sufferings you can doom me to, and poor frail nature may shed tears, or
send forth cries; but I trust my soul is anchored firmly on the rock of
ages.""Do your duty," said the Duke to the executioner.The fellow advanced, and asked, with a harsh and discordant voice, upon
which of the prisoner's limbs he should first employ his engine."Let him choose for himself," said the Duke; "I should like to oblige him
in any thing that is reasonable.""Since you leave it to me," said the prisoner, stretching forth his right
leg, "take the best--I willingly bestow it in the cause for which I
suffer."[Note: This was the reply actually made by James Mitchell when
subjected to the torture of the boot, for an attempt to assassinate
Archbishop Sharpe.]The executioner, with the help of his assistants, enclosed the leg and
knee within the tight iron boot, or case, and then placing a wedge of the
same metal between the knee and the edge of the machine, took a mallet in
his hand, and stood waiting for farther orders.A well-dressed man, by
profession a surgeon, placed himself by the other side of the prisoner's
chair, bared the prisoner's arm, and applied his thumb to the pulse in
order to regulate the torture according to the strength of the patient.When these preparations were made, the President of the Council repeated
with the same stern voice the question, "When and where did you last see
John Balfour of Burley?"The prisoner, instead of replying to him, turned his eyes to heaven as if
imploring Divine strength, and muttered a few words, of which the last
were distinctly audible, "Thou hast said thy people shall be willing in
the day of thy power!"The Duke of Lauderdale glanced his eye around the council as if to
collect their suffrages, and, judging from their mute signs, gave on his
own part a nod to the executioner, whose mallet instantly descended on
the wedge, and, forcing it between the knee and the iron boot, occasioned
the most exquisite pain, as was evident from the flush which instantly
took place on the brow and on the cheeks of the sufferer.The fellow then
again raised his weapon, and stood prepared to give a second blow."Will you yet say," repeated the Duke of Lauderdale, "where and when you
last parted from Balfour of Burley?""You have my answer," said the sufferer resolutely, and the second blow
fell.The third and fourth succeeded; but at the fifth, when a larger
wedge had been introduced, the prisoner set up a scream of agony.Morton, whose blood boiled within him at witnessing such cruelty, could
bear no longer, and, although unarmed and himself in great danger, was
springing forward, when Claverhouse, who observed his emotion, withheld
him by force, laying one hand on his arm and the other on his mouth,
while he whispered, "For God's sake, think where you are!"This movement, fortunately for him, was observed by no other of the
councillors, whose attention was engaged with the dreadful scene before
them."He is gone," said the surgeon--"he has fainted, my Lords, and human
nature can endure no more.""Release him," said the Duke; and added, turning to Dalzell, "He will
make an old proverb good, for he'll scarce ride to-day, though he has had
his boots on."Ay, dispatch his sentence, and have done with him; we have plenty of
drudgery behind."Strong waters and essences were busily employed to recall the senses of
the unfortunate captive; and, when his first faint gasps intimated a
return of sensation, the Duke pronounced sentence of death upon him, as a
traitor taken in the act of open rebellion, and adjudged him to be
carried from the bar to the common place of execution, and there hanged
by the neck; his head and hands to be stricken off after death, and
disposed of according to the pleasure of the Council, [Note: The pleasure
of the Council respecting the relics of their victims was often as savage
as the rest of their conduct.The heads of the preachers were frequently
exposed on pikes between their two hands, the palms displayed as in the
attitude of prayer.When the celebrated Richard Cameron's head was
exposed in this manner, a spectator bore testimony to it as that of one
who lived praying and preaching, and died praying and fighting.]and all
and sundry his movable goods and gear escheat and inbrought to his
Majesty's use."Doomster," he continued, "repeat the sentence to the prisoner."The office of Doomster was in those days, and till a much later period,
held by the executioner in commendam, with his ordinary functions.[Note:
See a note on the subject of this office in the Heart of Mid-Lothian.]The duty consisted in reciting to the unhappy criminal the sentence of
the law as pronounced by the judge, which acquired an additional and
horrid emphasis from the recollection, that the hateful personage by whom
it was uttered was to be the agent of the cruelties he denounced.Macbriar had scarce understood the purport of the words as first
pronounced by the Lord President of the Council; but he was sufficiently
recovered to listen and to reply to the sentence when uttered by the
harsh and odious voice of the ruffian who was to execute it, and at the
last awful words, "And this I pronounce for doom," he answered boldly--
"My Lords, I thank you for the only favour I looked for, or would accept
at your hands, namely, that you have sent the crushed and maimed carcass,
which has this day sustained your cruelty, to this hasty end.It were
indeed little to me whether I perish on the gallows or in the
prison-house; but if death, following close on what I have this day
suffered, had found me in my cell of darkness and bondage, many might
have lost the sight how a Christian man can suffer in the good cause.For
the rest, I forgive you, my Lords, for what you have appointed and I have
sustained--And why should I not?--Ye send me to a happy exchange--to the
company of angels and the spirits of the just, for that of frail dust
and ashes--Ye send me from darkness into day--from mortality to
immortality--and, in a word, from earth to heaven!--If the thanks,
therefore, and pardon of a dying man can do you good, take them at my
hand, and may your last moments be as happy as mine!"As he spoke thus, with a countenance radiant with joy and triumph, he was
withdrawn by those who had brought him into the apartment, and executed
within half an hour, dying with the same enthusiastic firmness which his
whole life had evinced.The Council broke up, and Morton found himself again in the carriage with
General Grahame."Marvellous firmness and gallantry!"said Morton, as he reflected upon
Macbriar's conduct; "what a pity it is that with such self-devotion and
heroism should have been mingled the fiercer features of his sect!""You mean," said Claverhouse, "his resolution to condemn you to death?--
To that he would have reconciled himself by a single text; for example,
'And Phinehas arose and executed judgment,' or something to the same
purpose.--But wot ye where you are now bound, Mr Morton?""We are on the road to Leith, I observe," answered Morton."Can I not be
permitted to see my friends ere I leave my native land?""Your uncle," replied Grahame, "has been spoken to, and declines visiting
you.The good gentleman is terrified, and not without some reason, that
the crime of your treason may extend itself over his lands and
tenements--he sends you, however, his blessing, and a small sum of money.Major Bellenden is at
Tillietudlem putting matters in order.The scoundrels have made great
havoc there with Lady Margaret's muniments of antiquity, and have
desecrated and destroyed what the good lady called the Throne of his most
Sacred Majesty.Is there any one else whom you would wish to see?"Morton sighed deeply as he answered, "No--it would avail nothing.--But my
preparations,--small as they are, some must be necessary.""They are all ready for you," said the General."Lord Evandale has
anticipated all you wish.Here is a packet from him with letters of
recommendation for the court of the Stadtholder Prince of Orange, to
which I have added one or two.I made my first campaigns under him, and
first saw fire at the battle of Seneff.Claverhouse
greatly distinguished himself in this action, and was made Captain.]There are also bills of exchange for your immediate wants, and more will
be sent when you require it."Morton heard all this and received the parcel with an astounded and
confused look, so sudden was the execution of the sentence of banishment."He shall be taken care of, and replaced, if it be practicable, in the
service of Lady Margaret Bellenden; I think he will hardly neglect the
parade of the feudal retainers, or go a-whigging a second time.--But here
we are upon the quay, and the boat waits you."A boat waited for Captain Morton, with
the trunks and baggage belonging to his rank.Claverhouse shook him by
the hand, and wished him good fortune, and a happy return to Scotland in
quieter times."I shall never forget," he said, "the gallantry of your behaviour to my
friend Evandale, in circumstances when many men would have sought to rid
him out of their way."As Morton descended the pier
to get into the boat, a hand placed in his a letter folded up in very
small space.The person who gave it seemed much muffled
up; he pressed his finger upon his lip, and then disappeared among the
crowd.The incident awakened Morton's curiosity; and when he found
himself on board of a vessel bound for Rotterdam, and saw all his
companions of the voyage busy making their own arrangements, he took an
opportunity to open the billet thus mysteriously thrust upon him.It ran
thus:--"Thy courage on the fatal day when Israel fled before his
enemies, hath, in some measure, atoned for thy unhappy owning of the
Erastian interest.These are not days for Ephraim to strive with Israel.--I know thy heart is with the daughter of the stranger.But turn from
that folly; for in exile, and in flight, and even in death itself, shall
my hand be heavy against that bloody and malignant house, and Providence
hath given me the means of meting unto them with their own measure of
ruin and confiscation.The resistance of their stronghold was the main
cause of our being scattered at Bothwell Bridge, and I have bound it upon
my soul to visit it upon them.Wherefore, think of her no more, but join
with our brethren in banishment, whose hearts are still towards this
miserable land to save and to relieve her.There is an honest remnant in
Holland whose eyes are looking out for deliverance.Join thyself unto
them like the true son of the stout and worthy Silas Morton, and thou
wilt have good acceptance among them for his sake and for thine own
working.Shouldst thou be found worthy again to labour in the vineyard,
thou wilt at all times hear of my in-comings and out-goings, by enquiring
after Quintin Mackell of Irongray, at the house of that singular
Christian woman, Bessie Maclure, near to the place called the Howff,
where Niel Blane entertaineth guests.So much from him who hopes to hear
again from thee in brotherhood, resisting unto blood, and striving
against sin.Keep thy sword
girded, and thy lamp burning, as one that wakes in the night; for He who
shall judge the Mount of Esau, and shall make false professors as straw,
and malignants as stubble, will come in the fourth watch with garments
dyed in blood, and the house of Jacob shall be for spoil, and the house
of Joseph for fire.I am he that hath written it, whose hand hath been on
the mighty in the waste field."This extraordinary letter was subscribed J. B. of B.; but the signature
of these initials was not necessary for pointing out to Morton that it
could come from no other than Burley.It gave him new occasion to admire
the indomitable spirit of this man, who, with art equal to his courage
and obstinacy, was even now endeavouring to re-establish the web of
conspiracy which had been so lately torn to pieces.But he felt no sort
of desire, in the present moment, to sustain a correspondence which must
be perilous, or to renew an association, which, in so many ways, had been
nearly fatal to him.The threats which Burley held out against the family
of Bellenden, he considered as a mere expression of his spleen on account
of their defence of Tillietudlem; and nothing seemed less likely than
that, at the very moment of their party being victorious, their fugitive
and distressed adversary could exercise the least influence over their
fortunes.Morton, however, hesitated for an instant, whether he should not send
the Major or Lord Evandale intimation of Burley's threats.Upon
consideration, he thought he could not do so without betraying his
confidential correspondence; for to warn them of his menaces would have
served little purpose, unless he had given them a clew to prevent them,
by apprehending his person; while, by doing so, he deemed he should
commit an ungenerous breach of trust to remedy an evil which seemed
almost imaginary.Upon mature consideration, therefore, he tore the
letter, having first made a memorandum of the name and place where the
writer was to be heard of, and threw the fragments into the sea.While Morton was thus employed the vessel was unmoored, and the white
sails swelled out before a favourable north-west wind.The ship leaned
her side to the gale, and went roaring through the waves, leaving a long
and rippling furrow to track her course.The city and port from which he
had sailed became undistinguishable in the distance; the hills by which
they were surrounded melted finally into the blue sky, and Morton was
separated for several years from the land of his nativity.It is fortunate for tale-tellers that they are not tied down like
theatrical writers to the unities of time and place, but may conduct
their personages to Athens and Thebes at their pleasure, and bring them
back at their convenience.Time, to use Rosalind's simile, has hitherto
paced with the hero of our tale; for betwixt Morton's first appearance as
a competitor for the popinjay and his final departure for Holland hardly
two months elapsed.Years, however, glided away ere we find it possible
to resume the thread of our narrative, and Time must be held to have
galloped over the interval.Craving, therefore, the privilege of my cast,
I entreat the reader's attention to the continuation of the narrative, as
it starts from a new era, being the year immediately subsequent to the
British Revolution.Scotland had just begun to repose from the convulsion occasioned by a
change of dynasty, and, through the prudent tolerance of King William,
had narrowly escaped the horrors of a protracted civil war.Agriculture
began to revive, and men, whose minds had been disturbed by the violent
political concussions, and the general change of government in Church and
State, had begun to recover their ordinary temper, and to give the usual
attention to their own private affairs, in lieu of discussing those of
the public.The Highlanders alone resisted the newly established order of
things, and were in arms in a considerable body under the Viscount of
Dundee, whom our readers have hitherto known by the name of Grahame of
Claverhouse.But the usual state of the Highlands was so unruly that
their being more or less disturbed was not supposed greatly to affect the
general tranquillity of the country, so long as their disorders were
confined within their own frontiers.In the Lowlands, the Jacobites, now
the undermost party, had ceased to expect any immediate advantage by open
resistance, and were, in their turn, driven to hold private meetings, and
form associations for mutual defence, which the government termed
treason, while they cried out persecution.The triumphant Whigs, while they re-established Presbytery as the
national religion, and assigned to the General Assemblies of the Kirk
their natural influence, were very far from going the lengths which the
Cameronians and more extravagant portion of the nonconformists under
Charles and James loudly demanded.They would listen to no proposal for
re-establishing the Solemn League and Covenant; and those who had
expected to find in King William a zealous Covenanted Monarch, were
grievously disappointed when he intimated, with the phlegm peculiar to
his country, his intention to tolerate all forms of religion which were
consistent with the safety of the State.The principles of indulgence
thus espoused and gloried in by the Government gave great offence to the
more violent party, who condemned them as diametrically contrary to
Scripture,--for which narrow-spirited doctrine they cited various texts,
all, as it may well be supposed, detached from their context, and most of
them derived from the charges given to the Jews in the Old Testament
dispensation to extirpate idolaters out of the Promised Land.They also
murmured highly against the influence assumed by secular persons in
exercising the rights of patronage, which they termed a rape upon the
chastity of the Church.They censured and condemned as Erastian many of
the measures by which Government after the Revolution showed an
inclination to interfere with the management of the Church, and they
positively refused to take the oath of allegiance to King William and
Queen Mary until they should, on their part, have sworn to the Solemn
League--and Covenant, the Magna Charta, as they termed it, of the
Presbyterian Church.This party, therefore, remained grumbling and dissatisfied, and made
repeated declarations against defections and causes of wrath, which, had
they been prosecuted as in the two former reigns, would have led to the
same consequence of open rebellion.But as the murmurers were allowed to
hold their meetings uninterrupted, and to testify as much as they pleased
against Socinianism, Erastianism, and all the compliances and defections
of the time, their zeal, unfanned by persecution, died gradually away,
their numbers became diminished, and they sunk into the scattered remnant
of serious, scrupulous, and harmless enthusiasts, of whom Old Mortality,
whose legends have afforded the groundwork of my tale, may be taken as no
bad representative.But in the years which immediately succeeded the
Revolution, the Cameronians continued a sect strong in numbers and
vehement in their political opinions, whom Government wished to
discourage, while they prudently temporised with them.These men formed
one violent party in the State; and the Episcopalian and Jacobite
interest, notwithstanding their ancient and national animosity, yet
repeatedly endeavoured to intrigue among them, and avail themselves of
their discontents, to obtain their assistance in recalling the Stewart
family.The Revolutionary Government in the mean while, was supported by
the great bulk of the Lowland interest, who were chiefly disposed to a
moderate Presbytery, and formed in a great measure the party who in the
former oppressive reigns were stigmatized by the Cameronians for having
exercised that form of worship under the declaration of Indulgence issued
by Charles II.Such was the state of parties in Scotland immediately
subsequent to the Revolution.It was on a delightful summer evening that a stranger, well mounted, and
having the appearance of a military man of rank, rode down a winding
descent which terminated in view of the romantic ruins of Bothwell Castle
and the river Clyde, which winds so beautifully between rocks and woods
to sweep around the towers formerly built by Aymer de Valence.Bothwell
Bridge was at a little distance, and also in sight.The opposite field,
once the scene of slaughter and conflict, now lay as placid and quiet as
the surface of a summer lake.The trees and bushes, which grew around in
romantic variety of shade, were hardly seen to stir under the influence
of the evening breeze.The very murmur of the river seemed to soften
itself into unison with the stillness of the scene around.The path through which the traveller descended was occasionally shaded by
detached trees of great size, and elsewhere by the hedges and boughs of
flourishing orchards, now laden with summer fruits.The nearest object of consequence was a farmhouse, or, it might be, the
abode of a small proprietor, situated on the side of a sunny bank which
was covered by apple and pear trees.At the foot of the path which led up
to this modest mansion was a small cottage, pretty much in the situation
of a porter's lodge, though obviously not designed for such a purpose.The hut seemed comfortable, and more neatly arranged than is usual in
Scotland.It had its little garden, where some fruit-trees and bushes
were mingled with kitchen herbs; a cow and six sheep fed in a paddock
hard by; the cock strutted and crowed, and summoned his family around him
before the door; a heap of brushwood and turf, neatly made up, indicated
that the winter fuel was provided; and the thin blue smoke which ascended
from the straw-bound chimney, and winded slowly out from among the green
trees, showed that the evening meal was in the act of being made ready.To complete the little scene of rural peace and comfort, a girl of about
five years old was fetching water in a pitcher from a beautiful fountain
of the purest transparency, which bubbled up at the root of a decayed old
oak-tree about twenty yards from the end of the cottage.The stranger reined up his horse and called to the little nymph, desiring
to know the way to Fairy Knowe.The child set down her water-pitcher,
hardly understanding what was said to her, put her fair flaxen hair apart
on her brows, and opened her round blue eyes with the wondering "What's
your wull?"which is usually a peasant's first answer, if it can be
called one, to all questions whatever."I wish to know the way to Fairy Knowe.""Mammie, mammie," exclaimed the little rustic, running towards the door
of the hut, "come out and speak to the gentleman."Her mother appeared,--a handsome young country-woman, to whose features,
originally sly and espiegle in expression, matrimony had given that
decent matronly air which peculiarly marks the peasant's wife of
Scotland.She had an infant in one arm, and with the other she smoothed
down her apron, to which hung a chubby child of two years old.The elder
girl, whom the traveller had first seen, fell back behind her mother as
soon as she appeared, and kept that station, occasionally peeping out to
look at the stranger.said the woman, with an air of respectful
breeding not quite common in her rank of life, but without anything
resembling forwardness.The stranger looked at her with great earnestness for a moment, and then
replied, "I am seeking a place called Fairy Knowe, and a man called
Cuthbert Headrigg."It's my gudeman, sir," said the young woman, with a smile of welcome."Will you alight, sir, and come into our puir dwelling?--Cuddie,
Cuddie,"--a white-headed rogue of four years appeared at the door of the
hut--"rin awa, my bonny man, and tell your father a gentleman wants him.Or, stay,--Jenny, ye'll hae mair sense: rin ye awa and tell him; he's
down at the Four-acres Park.--Winna ye light down and bide a blink, sir?Or would ye take a mouthfu' o' bread and cheese, or a drink o' ale, till
our gudeman comes.It's gude ale, though I shouldna say sae that brews
it; but ploughmanlads work hard, and maun hae something to keep their
hearts abune by ordinar, sae I aye pit a gude gowpin o' maut to the
browst."As the stranger declined her courteous offers, Cuddie, the reader's old
acquaintance, made his appearance in person.His countenance still
presented the same mixture of apparent dulness with occasional sparkles,
which indicated the craft so often found in the clouted shoe.He looked
on the rider as on one whom he never had before seen, and, like his
daughter and wife, opened the conversation with the regular query,
"What's your wull wi' me, sir?""I have a curiosity to ask some questions about this country," said the
traveller, "and I was directed to you as an intelligent man who can
answer them.""Nae doubt, sir," said Cuddie, after a moment's hesitation."But I would
first like to ken what sort of questions they are.I hae had sae mony
questions speered at me in my day, and in sic queer ways, that if ye kend
a', ye wadna wonder at my jalousing a' thing about them.My mother gar 'd
me learn the Single Carritch, whilk was a great vex; then I behoved to
learn about my godfathers and godmothers to please the auld leddy; and
whiles I jumbled them thegether and pleased nane o' them; and when I cam
to man's yestate, cam another kind o' questioning in fashion that I liked
waur than Effectual Calling; and the 'did promise and vow' of the tape
were yokit to the end o' the tother.Sae ye see, sir, I aye like to hear
questions asked befor I answer them.""You have nothing to apprehend from mine, my good friend; they only
relate to the state of the country."replied Cuddie; "ou, the country's weel eneugh, an it werena
that dour deevil, Claver'se (they ca' him Dundee now), that's stirring
about yet in the Highlands, they say, wi' a' the Donalds and Duncans and
Dugalds, that ever wore bottomless breeks, driving about wi' him, to set
things asteer again, now we hae gotten them a' reasonably weel settled.But Mackay will pit him down, there's little doubt o' that; he'll gie him
his fairing, I'll be caution for it.""What makes you so positive of that, my friend?""I heard it wi' my ain lugs," answered Cuddie, "foretauld to him by a man
that had been three hours stane dead, and came back to this earth again
just to tell him his mind.It was at a place they ca' Drumshinnel.""I can hardly believe you, my friend.""Ye might ask my mither, then, if she were in life," said Cuddie; "it was
her explained it a' to me, for I thought the man had only been wounded.At ony rate, he spake of the casting out of the Stewarts by their very
names, and the vengeance that was brewing for Claver'se and his dragoons.They ca'd the man Habakkuk Mucklewrath; his brain was a wee ajee, but he
was a braw preacher for a' that.""You seem," said the stranger, "to live in a rich and peaceful country.""It's no to compleen o', sir, an we get the crap weel in," quoth Cuddie;
"but if ye had seen the blude rinnin' as fast on the tap o' that brigg
yonder as ever the water ran below it, ye wadna hae thought it sae bonnie
a spectacle."I was waiting upon Monmouth that
morning, my good friend, and did see some part of the action," said the
stranger."Then ye saw a bonny stour," said Cuddie, "that sail serve me for
fighting a' the days o' my life.I judged ye wad be a trooper, by your
red scarlet lace-coat and your looped hat.""And which side were you upon, my friend?"continued the inquisitive
stranger.retorted Cuddie, with a knowing look, or what he designed for
such,--"there's nae use in telling that, unless I kend wha was asking
me.""I commend your prudence, but it is unnecessary; I know you acted on that
occasion as servant to Henry Morton."said Cuddie, in surprise, "how came ye by that secret?No that I
need care a bodee about it, for the sun's on our side o' the hedge now.I
wish my master were living to get a blink o't.""He was lost in the vessel gaun to that weary Holland,--clean lost; and
a' body perished, and my poor master amang them.Neither man nor mouse
was ever heard o' mair.""You had some regard for him, then?"His face was made of a fiddle, as they say, for a'
body that looked on him liked him.Oh, an ye
had but seen him down at the brigg there, fleeing about like a fleeing
dragon to gar folk fight that had unto little will till 't!There was he
and that sour Whigamore they ca'd Burley: if twa men could hae won a
field, we wadna hae gotten our skins paid that day.""You mention Burley: do you know if he yet lives?"Folk say he was abroad, and our sufferers wad
hold no communion wi' him, because o' his having murdered the archbishop.Sae he cam hame ten times dourer than ever, and broke aff wi' mony o' the
Presbyterians; and at this last coming of the Prince of Orange he could
get nae countenance nor command for fear of his deevilish temper, and he
hasna been heard of since; only some folk say that pride and anger hae
driven him clean wud.""And--and," said the traveller, after considerable hesitation,--"do you
know anything of Lord Evan dale?""<DW37> I ken onything o' Lord Evandale?Is not my young leddy up
by yonder at the house, that's as gude as married to him?""No, only what they ca' betrothed,--me and my wife were witnesses.It's
no mony months bypast; it was a lang courtship,--few folk kend the reason
by Jenny and mysell.I downa bide to see ye
sitting up there, and the clouds are casting up thick in the west ower
Glasgow-ward, and maist skeily folk think that bodes rain."In fact, a deep black cloud had already surmounted the setting sun; a few
large drops of rain fell, and the murmurs of distant thunder were heard."The deil's in this man," said Cuddie to himself; "I wish he would either
light aff or ride on, that he may quarter himsell in Hamilton or the
shower begin."But the rider sate motionless on his horse for two or three moments after
his last question, like one exhausted by some uncommon effort.At length,
recovering himself as if with a sudden and painful effort, he asked
Cuddie "if Lady Margaret Bellenden still lived.""She does," replied Cuddie, "but in a very sma' way.They hae been a sad
changed family since thae rough times began; they hae suffered eneugh
first and last,--and to lose the auld Tower and a' the bonny barony and
the holms that I hae pleughed sae often, and the Mains, and my kale-yard,
that I suld hae gotten back again, and a' for naething, as 'a body may
say, but just the want o' some bits of sheep-skin that were lost in the
confusion of the taking of Tillietudlem.""I have heard something of this," said the stranger, deepening his voice
and averting his head."I have some interest in the family, and would
willingly help them if I could.Can you give me a bed in your house
to-night, my friend?""It's but a corner of a place, sir," said Cuddie, "but we'se try, rather
than ye suld ride on in the rain and thunner; for, to be free wi' ye,
sir, I think ye seem no that ower weel.""I am liable to a dizziness," said the stranger, "but it will soon wear
off.""I ken we can gie ye a decent supper, sir," said Cuddie; "and we'll see
about a bed as weel as we can.We wad be laith a stranger suld lack what
we have, though we are jimply provided for in beds rather; for Jenny has
sae mony bairns (God bless them and her) that troth I maun speak to Lord
Evandale to gie us a bit eik, or outshot o' some sort, to the onstead.""I shall be easily accommodated," said the stranger, as he entered the
house."And ye may rely on your naig being weel sorted," said Cuddie; "I ken
weel what belangs to suppering a horse, and this is a very gude ane."Cuddie took the horse to the little cow-house, and called to his wife to
attend in the mean while to the stranger's accommodation.The officer
entered, and threw himself on a settle at some distance from the fire,
and carefully turning his back to the little lattice window.Headrigg, if the reader pleases, requested him to lay aside the
cloak, belt, and flapped hat which he wore upon his journey, but he
excused himself under pretence of feeling cold, and, to divert the time
till Cuddie's return, he entered into some chat with the children,
carefully avoiding, during the interval, the inquisitive glances of his
landlady.Our broken friendships we deplore,
                    And loves of youth that are no more.Cuddie soon returned, assuring the stranger, with a cheerful voice, "that
the horse was properly suppered up, and that the gudewife should make a
bed up for him at the house, mair purpose-like and comfortable than the
like o' them could gie him."said the stranger, with an interrupted and
broken voice."No, stir, they're awa wi' a' the servants,--they keep only twa nowadays,
and my gudewife there has the keys and the charge, though she's no a
fee'd servant.She has been born and bred in the family, and has a' trust
and management.If they were there, we behovedna to take sic freedom
without their order; but when they are awa, they will be weel pleased we
serve a stranger gentleman.Miss Bellenden wad help a' the haill warld,
an her power were as gude as her will; and her grandmother, Leddy
Margaret, has an unto respect for the gentry, and she's no ill to the
poor bodies neither.--And now, wife, what for are ye no getting forrit
wi' the sowens?""Never mind, lad," rejoined Jenny, "ye sall hae them in gude time; I ken
weel that ye like your brose het."Cuddie fidgeted and laughed with a peculiar expression of intelligence at
this repartee, which was followed by a dialogue of little consequence
betwixt his wife and him, in which the stranger took no share.At length
he suddenly interrupted them by the question: "Can you tell me when Lord
Evandale's marriage takes place?""Very soon, we expect," answered Jenny, before it was possible for her
husband to reply; "it wad hae been ower afore now, but for the death o'
auld Major Bellenden."said the stranger; "I heard at Edinburgh he was
no more."He couldna be said to haud up his head after his brother's wife and his
niece were turned out o' their ain house; and he had himsell sair
borrowing siller to stand the law,--but it was in the latter end o' King
James's days; and Basil Olifant, who claimed the estate, turned a <DW7>
to please the managers, and then naething was to be refused him.Sae the
law gaed again the leddies at last, after they had fought a weary sort o'
years about it; and, as I said before, the major ne'er held up his head
again.And then cam the pitting awa o' the Stewart line; and, though he
had but little reason to like them, he couldna brook that, and it clean
broke the heart o' him; and creditors cam to Charnwood and cleaned out a'
that was there,--he was never rich, the gude auld man, for he dow'd na
see onybody want.""He was indeed," said the stranger, with a faltering voice, "an admirable
man,--that is, I have heard that he was so.So the ladies were left
without fortune, as well as without a protector?""They will neither want the tane nor the tother while Lord Evandale
lives," said Jenny; "he has been a true friend in their griefs.E'en to
the house they live in is his lordship's; and never man, as my auld
gudemother used to say, since the days of the Patriarch Jacob, served sae
lang and sae sair for a wife as gude Lord Evandale has dune.""And why," said the stranger, with a voice that quivered with emotion,
"why was he not sooner rewarded by the object of his attachment?""There was the lawsuit to be ended," said Jenny readily, "forby many
other family arrangements.""Na, but," said Cuddie, "there was another reason forby; for the young
leddy--"

"Whisht, hand your tongue, and sup your sowens," said his wife; "I see
the gentleman's far frae weel, and downa eat our coarse supper.I wad
kill him a chicken in an instant.""There is no occasion," said the stranger; "I shall want only a glass of
water, and to be left alone.""You'll gie yoursell the trouble then to follow me," said Jenny, lighting
a small lantern, "and I'll show you the way."Cuddie also proffered his assistance; but his wife reminded him, "That
the bairns would be left to fight thegither, and coup ane anither into
the fire," so that he remained to take charge of the menage.His wife led the way up a little winding path, which, after threading
some thickets of sweetbrier and honeysuckle, conducted to the back-door
of a small garden.Jenny undid the latch, and they passed through an
old-fashioned flower-garden, with its clipped yew hedges and formal
parterres, to a glass-sashed door, which she opened with a master-key,
and lighting a candle, which she placed upon a small work-table, asked
pardon for leaving him there for a few minutes, until she prepared his
apartment.She did not exceed five minutes in these preparations; but
when she returned, was startled to find that the stranger had sunk
forward with his head upon the table, in what she at first apprehended to
be a swoon.As she advanced to him, however, she could discover by his
short-drawn sobs that it was a paroxysm of mental agony.She prudently
drew back until he raised his head, and then showing herself, without
seeming to have observed his agitation, informed him that his bed was
prepared.The stranger gazed at her a moment, as if to collect the sense
of her words.She repeated them; and only bending his head, as an
indication that he understood her, he entered the apartment, the door of
which she pointed out to him.It was a small bedchamber, used, as she
informed him, by Lord Evandale when a guest at Fairy Knowe, connecting,
on one side, with a little china-cabinet which opened to the garden, and
on the other, with a saloon, from which it was only separated by a thin
wainscot partition.Having wished the stranger better health and good
rest, Jenny descended as speedily as she could to her own mansion.she exclaimed to her helpmate as she entered, "I doubt
we're ruined folk!"returned the imperturbed
Cuddie, who was one of those persons who do not easily take alarm at
anything."Wha d' ye think yon gentleman is?Oh that ever ye suld hae asked him to
light here!""Why, wha the muckle deil d'ye say he is?There's nae law against
harbouring and intercommunicating now," said Cuddie; "sae, Whig or Tory,
what need we care wha he be?""Ay, but it's ane will ding Lord Evandale's marriage ajee yet, if it's
no the better looked to," said Jenny; "it's Miss Edith's first joe, your
ain auld maister, Cuddie."exclaimed Cuddie, starting up, "Crow ye that I am
blind?"Ay, but, Cuddie lad," replied Jenny, "though ye are no blind, ye are no
sae notice-taking as I am.""Weel, what for needs ye cast that up to me just now; or what did ye see
about the man that was like our Maister Harry?""I jaloused his keeping his face frae us,
and speaking wi' a madelike voice, sae I e'en tried him wi' some tales
o lang syne; and when I spake o' the brose, ye ken, he didna just
laugh,--he's ower grave for that nowadays, but he gae a gledge wi' his
ee that I kend he took up what I said.And a' his distress is about Miss
Edith's marriage; and I ne'er saw a man mair taen down wi' true love in
my days,--I might say man or woman, only I mind how ill Miss Edith was
when she first gat word that him and you (ye muckle graceless loon) were
coming against Tillietudlem wi' the rebels.--But what's the matter wi'
the man now?""What's the matter wi' me indeed!"said Cuddie, who was again hastily
putting on some of the garments he had stripped himself of; "am I no gaun
up this instant to see my maister?""Atweel, Cuddie, ye are gaun nae sic gate," said Jenny, coolly and
resolutely."D 'ye think I am to be John
Tamson's man, and maistered by women a' the days o' my life?""And whase man wad ye be?And wha wad ye hae to maister ye but me,
Cuddie, lad?""I'll gar ye comprehend in the making of a
hay-band.Naebody kens that this young gentleman is living but oursells;
and frae that he keeps himsell up sae close, I am judging that he's
purposing, if he fand Miss Edith either married, or just gaun to be
married, he wad just slide awa easy, and gie them nae mair trouble.But
if Miss Edith kend that he was living, and if she were standing before
the very minister wi' Lord Evandale when it was tauld to her, I'se
warrant she wad say No when she suld say Yes.""Weel," replied Cuddie, "and what's my business wi' that?If Miss Edith
likes her auld joe better than her new ane, what for suld she no be free
to change her mind like other folk?Ye ken, Jenny, Halliday aye threeps
he had a promise frae yoursell.""Halliday's a liar, and ye're naething but a gomeril to hearken till him,
Cuddie.And then for this leddy's choice, lack-a-day!ye may be sure a'
the gowd Mr.Morton has is on the outside o' his coat; and how can he
keep Leddy Margaret and the young leddy?""Nae doubt the auld laird left his
housekeeper the liferent, as he heard nought o' his nephew; but it's but
speaking the auld wife fair, and they may a' live brawly thegither, Leddy
Margaret and a'.""Rout tout, lad," replied Jenny; "ye ken them little to think leddies o'
their rank wad set up house wi' auld Ailie Wilson, when they're maist
ower proud to take favours frae Lord Evandale himsell.Na, na, they maun
follow the camp, if she tak Morton.""That wad sort ill wi' the auld leddy, to be sure," said Cuddie; "she wad
hardly win ower a lang day in the baggage-wain.""Then sic a flyting as there wad be between them, a' about Whig and
Tory," continued Jenny."To be sure," said Cuddie, "the auld leddy's unto kittle in thae
points.""And then, Cuddie," continued his helpmate, who had reserved her
strongest argument to the last, "if this marriage wi' Lord Evandale is
broken off, what comes o' our ain bit free house, and the kale-yard, and
the cow's grass?I trow that baith us and thae bonny bairns will be
turned on the wide warld!"Here Jenny began to whimper; Cuddie writhed himself this way and that
way, the very picture of indecision.At length he broke out, "Weel,
woman, canna ye tell us what we suld do, without a' this din about it?""Just do naething at a'," said Jenny."Never seem to ken onything about
this gentleman, and for your life say a word that he suld hae been here,
or up at the house!An I had kend, I wad hae gien him my ain bed, and
sleepit in the byre or he had gane up by; but it canna be helpit now.The
neist thing's to get him cannily awa the morn, and I judge he'll be in
nae hurry to come back again."said Cuddie; "and maun I no speak to him, then?""For your life, no," said Jenny."Ye're no obliged to ken him; and I
wadna hae tauld ye, only I feared ye wad ken him in the morning.""Aweel," said Cuddie, sighing heavily, "I'se awa to pleugh the outfield
then; for if I am no to speak to him, I wad rather be out o' the gate.""Very right, my dear hinny," replied Jenny."Naebody has better sense than
you when ye crack a bit wi' me ower your affairs; but ye suld ne'er do
onything aff hand out o' your ain head.""Ane wad think it's true," quoth Cuddie; "for I hae aye had some carline
or quean or another to gar me gang their gate instead o' my ain.There
was first my mither," he continued, as he undressed and tumbled himself
into bed; "then there was Leddy Margaret didna let me ca' my soul my ain;
then my mither and her quarrelled, and pu'ed me twa ways at anes, as if
ilk ane had an end o' me, like Punch and the Deevil rugging about the
Baker at the fair; and now I hae gotten a wife," he murmured in
continuation, as he stowed the blankets around his person, "and she's
like to tak the guiding o' me a' thegither.""And amna I the best guide ye ever had in a' your life?"said Jenny, as
she closed the conversation by assuming her place beside her husband and
extinguishing the candle.Leaving this couple to their repose, we have next to inform the reader
that, early on the next morning, two ladies on horseback, attended by
their servants, arrived at the house of Fairy Knowe, whom, to Jenny's
utter confusion, she instantly recognised as Miss Bellenden and Lady
Emily Hamilton, a sister of Lord Evandale."Had I no better gang to the house to put things to rights?"said Jenny,
confounded with this unexpected apparition."We want nothing but the pass-key," said Miss Bellenden; "Gudyill will
open the windows of the little parlour.""The little parlour's locked, and the lock's, spoiled," answered Jenny,
who recollected the local spmpathy between that apartment and the
bedchamber of her guest."In the red parlour, then," said Miss Bellenden, and rode up to the front
of the house, but by an approach different from that through which Morton
had been conducted."All will be out," thought Jenny, "unless I can get him smuggled out of
the house the back way."So saying, she sped up the bank in great tribulation and uncertainty."I had better hae said at ante there was a stranger there," was her next
natural reflection."But then they wad hae been for asking him to
breakfast.what will I do?--And there's Gudyill walking in
the garden too!"she exclaimed internally on approaching the wicket; "and
I daurna gang in the back way till he's aff the coast.In this state of perplexity she approached the cidevant butler, with the
purpose of decoying him out of the garden.But John Gudyill's temper was
not improved by his decline in rank and increase in years.Like many
peevish people, too, he seemed to have an intuitive perception as to what
was most likely to teaze those whom he conversed with; and, on the
present occasion, all Jenny's efforts to remove him from the garden
served only to root him in it as fast as if he had been one of the
shrubs.Unluckily, also, he had commenced florist during his residence at Fairy
Knowe; and, leaving all other things to the charge of Lady Emily's
servant, his first care was dedicated to the flowers, which he had taken
under his special protection, and which he propped, dug, and watered,
prosing all the while upon their respective merits to poor Jenny, who
stood by him trembling and almost crying with anxiety, fear, and
impatience.Fate seemed determined to win a match against Jenny this unfortunate
morning.As soon as the ladies entered the house, they observed that the
door of the little parlour--the very apartment out of which she was
desirous of excluding them on account of its contiguity to the room in
which Morton slept--was not only unlocked, but absolutely ajar.Miss
Bellenden was too much engaged with her own immediate subjects of
reflection to take much notice of the circumstance, but, desiring the
servant to open the window-shutters, walked into the room along with her
friend."He is not yet come," she said.Why
express so anxious a wish that we should meet him here?And why not come
to Castle Dinnan, as he proposed?I own, my dear Emily, that, even
engaged as we are to each other, and with the sanction of your presence,
I do not feel that I have done quite right in indulging him.""Evandale was never capricious," answered his sister; "I am sure he will
satisfy us with his reasons, and if he does not, I will help you to scold
him.""What I chiefly fear," said Edith, "is his having engaged in some of the
plots of this fluctuating and unhappy time.I know his heart is with that
dreadful Claverhouse and his army, and I believe he would have joined
them ere now but for my uncle's death, which gave him so much additional
trouble on our account.How singular that one so rational and so deeply
sensible of the errors of the exiled family should be ready to risk all
for their restoration!"answered Lady Emily,--"it is a point of honour with
Evandale.Our family have always been loyal; he served long in the
Guards; the Viscount of Dundee was his commander and his friend for
years; he is looked on with an evil eye by many of his own relations, who
set down his inactivity to the score of want of spirit.You must be
aware, my dear Edith, how often family connections and early
predilections influence our actions more than abstract arguments.But I
trust Evandale will continue quiet,--though, to tell you truth, I believe
you are the only one who can keep him so.""You can furnish him with the Scriptural apology for not going forth with
the host,--'he has married a wife, and therefore cannot come.'""I have promised," said Edith, in a faint voice; "but I trust I shall not
be urged on the score of time.""Nay," said Lady Emily, "I will leave Evandale (and here he comes) to
plead his own cause.""Stay, stay, for God's sake!"said Edith, endeavouring to detain her."Not I, not I," said the young lady, making her escape; "the third person
makes a silly figure on such occasions.When you want me for breakfast, I
will be found in the willow-walk by the river."As she tripped out of the room, Lord Evandale entered."Good-morrow,
Brother, and good-by till breakfast-time," said the lively young lady;
"I trust you will give Miss Bellenden some good reasons for disturbing
her rest so early in the morning."And so saying, she left them together, without waiting a reply."And now, my lord," said Edith, "may I desire to know the meaning of your
singular request to meet you here at so early an hour?"She was about to add that she hardly felt herself excusable in having
complied with it; but upon looking at the person whom she addressed, she
was struck dumb by the singular and agitated expression of his
countenance, and interrupted herself to exclaim, "For God's sake, what is
the matter?""His Majesty's faithful subjects have gained a great and most decisive
victory near Blair of Athole; but, alas!my gallant friend Lord Dundee--"

"Has fallen?"said Edith, anticipating the rest of his tidings."True, most true: he has fallen in the arms of victory, and not a man
remains of talents and influence sufficient to fill up his loss in King
James's service.This, Edith, is no time for temporizing with our duty.I
have given directions to raise my followers, and I must take leave of you
this evening.""Do not think of it, my lord," answered Edith; "your life is--essential
to your friends,--do not throw it away in an adventure so rash.What can
your single arm, and the few tenants or servants who might follow you, do
against the force of almost all Scotland, the Highland clans only
excepted?""Listen to me, Edith," said Lord Evandale."I am not so rash as you may
suppose me, nor are my present motives of such light importance as to
affect only those personally dependent on myself.The Life Guards, with
whom I served so long, although new-modelled and new-officered by the
Prince of Orange, retain a predilection for the cause of their rightful
master; and "--and here he whispered as if he feared even the walls of
the apartment had ears--"when my foot is known to be in the stirrup, two
regiments of cavalry have sworn to renounce the usurper's service, and
fight under my orders.They delayed only till Dundee should descend into
the Lowlands; but since he is no more, which of his successors dare take
that decisive step, unless encouraged by the troops declaring themselves!Meantime, the zeal of the soldiers will die away.I must bring them to a
decision while their hearts are glowing with the victory their old leader
has obtained, and burning to avenge his untimely death.""And will you, on the faith of such men as you know these soldiers to
be," said Edith, "take a part of such dreadful moment?""I will," said Lord Evandale,--"I must; my honour and loyalty are both
pledged for it.""And all for the sake," continued Miss Bellenden, "of a prince whose
measures, while he was on the throne, no one could condemn more than Lord
Evandale?""Most true," replied Lord Evandale; "and as I resented, even during the
plenitude of his power, his innovations on Church and State, like a
freeborn subject, I am determined I will assert his real rights, when he
is in adversity, like a loyal one.Let courtiers and sycophants flatter
power and desert misfortune; I will neither do the one nor the other.""And if you are determined to act what my feeble judgment must still term
rashly, why give yourself the pain of this untimely meeting?""Were it not enough to answer," said Lord Evandale, "that, ere rushing on
battle, I wished to bid adieu to my betrothed bride?Surely it is judging
coldly of my feelings, and showing too plainly the indifference of your
own, to question my motive for a request so natural.""But why in this place, my lord," said Edith; "and why with such peculiar
circumstances of mystery?""Because," he replied, putting a letter into her hand, "I have yet
another request, which I dare hardly proffer, even when prefaced by these
credentials."In haste and terror, Edith glanced over the letter, which was from her
grandmother."My dearest childe," such was its tenor in style and spelling, "I
     never more deeply regretted the reumatizm, which disqualified me
     from riding on horseback, than at this present writing, when I would
     most have wished to be where this paper will soon be, that is at
     Fairy Knowe, with my poor dear Willie's only child.But it is the
     will of God I should not be with her, which I conclude to be the
     case, as much for the pain I now suffer, as because it hath now not
     given way either to cammomile poultices or to decoxion of wild
     mustard, wherewith I have often relieved others.Therefore, I must
     tell you, by writing instead of word of mouth, that, as my young
     Lord Evandale is called to the present campaign, both by his honour
     and his duty, he hath earnestly solicited me that the bonds of holy
     matrimony be knitted before his departure to the wars between you
     and him, in implement of the indenture formerly entered into for
     that effeck, whereuntill, as I see no raisonable objexion, so I
     trust that you, who have been always a good and obedient childe,
     will not devize any which has less than raison.It is trew that the
     contrax of our house have heretofore been celebrated in a manner
     more befitting our Rank, and not in private, and with few witnesses,
     as a thing done in a corner.But it has been Heaven's own free will,
     as well as those of the kingdom where we live, to take away from us
     our estate, and from the King his throne.Yet I trust He will yet
     restore the rightful heir to the throne, and turn his heart to the
     true Protestant Episcopal faith, which I have the better right to
     expect to see even with my old eyes, as I have beheld the royal
     family when they were struggling as sorely with masterful usurpers
     and rebels as they are now; that is to say, when his most sacred
     Majesty, Charles the Second of happy memory, honoured our poor house
     of Tillietudlem by taking his _disjune_ therein," etc., etc., etc.We will not abuse the reader's patience by quoting more of Lady
Margaret's prolix epistle.Suffice it to say that it closed by laying her
commands on her grandchild to consent to the solemnization of her
marriage without loss of time."I never thought till this instant," said Edith, dropping the letter from
her hand, "that Lord Evandale would have acted ungenerously.""And how can you apply such a
term to my desire to call you mine, ere I part from you, perhaps for
ever?""Lord Evandale ought to have remembered," said Edith, "that when his
perseverance, and, I must add, a due sense of his merit and of the
obligations we owed him, wrung from me a slow consent that I would one
day comply with his wishes, I made it my condition that I should not be
pressed to a hasty accomplishment of my promise; and now he avails
himself of his interest with my only remaining relative to hurry me with
precipitate and even indelicate importunity.There is more selfishness
than generosity, my lord, in such eager and urgent solicitation."Lord Evandale, evidently much hurt, took two or three turns through the
apartment ere he replied to this accusation; at length he spoke: "I
should have escaped this painful charge, durst I at once have mentioned
to Miss Bellendon my principal reason for urging this request.It is one
which she will probably despise on her own account, but which ought to
weigh with her for the sake of Lady Margaret.My death in battle must
give my whole estate to my heirs of entail; my forfeiture as a traitor,
by the usurping Government, may vest it in the Prince of Orange or some
Dutch favourite.In either case, my venerable friend and betrothed bride
must remain unprotected and in poverty.Vested with the rights and
provisions of Lady Evandale, Edith will find, in the power of supporting
her aged parent, some consolation for having condescended to share the
titles and fortunes of one who does not pretend to be worthy of her."Edith was struck dumb by an argument which she had not expected, and was
compelled to acknowledge that Lord Evandale's suit was urged with
delicacy as well as with consideration."And yet," she said, "such is the waywardness with which my heart reverts
to former times that I cannot," she burst into tears, "suppress a degree
of ominous reluctance at fulfilling my engagement upon such a brief
summons.""We have already fully considered this painful subject," said Lord
Evandale; "and I hoped, my dear Edith, your own inquiries, as well as
mine, had fully convinced you that these regrets were fruitless."said Edith, with a deep sigh, which, as if by an
unexpected echo, was repeated from the adjoining apartment.Miss
Bellenden started at the sound, and scarcely composed herself upon Lord
Evandale's assurances that she had heard but the echo of her own
respiration."It sounded strangely distinct," she said, "and almost ominous; but my
feelings are so harassed that the slightest trifle agitates them."Lord Evandale eagerly attempted to soothe her alarm, and reconcile her to
a measure which, however hasty, appeared to him the only means by which
he could secure her independence.He urged his claim in virtue of the
contract, her grandmother's wish and command, the propriety of insuring
her comfort and independence, and touched lightly on his own long
attachment, which he had evinced by so many and such various services.These Edith felt the more, the less they were insisted upon; and at
length, as she had nothing to oppose to his ardour, excepting a causeless
reluctance which she herself was ashamed to oppose against so much
generosity, she was compelled to rest upon the impossibility of having
the ceremony performed upon such hasty notice, at such a time and place.But for all this Lord Evandale was prepared, and he explained, with
joyful alacrity, that the former chaplain of his regiment was in
attendance at the Lodge with a faithful domestic, once a non-commissioned
officer in the same corps; that his sister was also possessed of the
secret; and that Headrigg and his wife might be added to the list of
witnesses, if agreeable to Miss Bellenden.As to the place, he had chosen
it on very purpose.The marriage was to remain a secret, since Lord
Evandale was to depart in disguise very soon after it was solemnized,--a
circumstance which, had their union been public, must have drawn upon him
the attention of the Government, as being altogether unaccountable,
unless from his being engaged in some dangerous design.Having hastily
urged these motives and explained his arrangements, he ran, without
waiting for an answer, to summon his sister to attend his bride, while he
went in search of the other persons whose presence was necessary.When Lady Emily arrived, she found her friend in an agony of tears, of
which she was at some loss to comprehend the reason, being one of those
damsels who think there is nothing either wonderful or terrible in
matrimony, and joining with most who knew him in thinking that it could
not be rendered peculiarly alarming by Lord Evandale being the
bridegroom.Influenced by these feelings, she exhausted in succession all
the usual arguments for courage, and all the expressions of sympathy and
condolence ordinarily employed on such occasions.But when Lady Emily
beheld her future sister-in-law deaf to all those ordinary topics of
consolation; when she beheld tears follow fast and without intermission
down cheeks as pale as marble; when she felt that the hand which she
pressed in order to enforce her arguments turned cold within her grasp,
and lay, like that of a corpse, insensible and unresponsive to her
caresses, her feelings of sympathy gave way to those of hurt pride and
pettish displeasure."I must own," she said, "that I am something at a loss to understand all
this, Miss Bellenden.Months have passed since you agreed to marry my
brother, and you have postponed the fulfilment of your engagement from
one period to another, as if you had to avoid some dishonourable or
highly disagreeable connection.I think I can answer for Lord Evandale
that he will seek no woman's hand against her inclination; and, though
his sister, I may boldly say that he does not need to urge any lady
further than her inclinations carry her.You will forgive me, Miss
Bellenden; but your present distress augurs ill for my brother's future
happiness, and I must needs say that he does not merit all these
expressions of dislike and dolour, and that they seem an odd return for
an attachment which he has manifested so long, and in so many ways.""You are right, Lady Emily," said Edith, drying her eyes and endeavouring
to resume her natural manner, though still betrayed by her faltering
voice and the paleness of her cheeks,--"you are quite right; Lord
Evandale merits such usage from no one, least of all from her whom he has
honoured with his regard.But if I have given way, for the last time, to
a sudden and irresistible burst of feeling, it is my consolation, Lady
Emily, that your brother knows the cause, that I have hid nothing from
him, and that he at least is not apprehensive of finding in Edith
Bellenden a wife undeserving of his affection.But still you are right,
and I merit your censure for indulging for a moment fruitless regret and
painful remembrances.It shall be so no longer; my lot is cast with
Evandale, and with him I am resolved to bear it.Nothing shall in future
occur to excite his complaints or the resentment of his relations; no
idle recollections of other days shall intervene to prevent the zealous
and affectionate discharge of my duty; no vain illusions recall the
memory of other days--"

As she spoke these words, she slowly raised her eyes, which had before
been hidden by her hand, to the latticed window of her apartment, which
was partly open, uttered a dismal shriek, and fainted.Lady Emily turned
her eyes in the same direction, but saw only the shadow of a man, which
seemed to disappear from the window, and, terrified more by the state of
Edith than by the apparition she had herself witnessed, she uttered
shriek upon shriek for assistance.Her brother soon arrived, with the
chaplain and Jenny Dennison; but strong and vigorous remedies were
necessary ere they could recall Miss Bellenden to sense and motion.Even
then her language was wild and incoherent.[Illustration: Uttered A Dismal Shriek, And Fainted--224]


"Press me no farther," she said to Lord Evandale,--"it cannot be; Heaven
and earth, the living and the dead, have leagued themselves against this
ill-omened union.Take all I can give,--my sisterly regard, my devoted
friendship.I will love you as a sister and serve you as a bondswoman,
but never speak to me more of marriage."The astonishment of Lord Evandale may easily be conceived."Emily," he said to his sister, "this is your doing.I was accursed when
I thought of bringing you here; some of your confounded folly has driven
her mad!""On my word, Brother," answered Lady Emily, "you're sufficient to drive
all the women in Scotland mad.Because your mistress seems much disposed
to jilt you, you quarrel with your sister, who has been arguing in your
cause, and had brought her to a quiet hearing, when, all of a sudden, a
man looked in at a window, whom her crazed sensibility mistook either for
you or some one else, and has treated us gratis with an excellent tragic
scene."said Lord Evandale, in impatient displeasure."Miss Bellenden is incapable of trifling with me; and yet what else could
have--"

"Hush!said Jenny, whose interest lay particularly in shifting
further inquiry; "for Heaven's sake, my lord, speak low, for my lady
begins to recover."Edith was no sooner somewhat restored to herself than she begged, in a
feeble voice, to be left alone with Lord Evandale.All retreated,--Jenny
with her usual air of officious simplicity, Lady Emily and the chaplain
with that of awakened curiosity.No sooner had they left the apartment
than Edith beckoned Lord Evandale to sit beside her on the couch; her
next motion was to take his hand, in spite of his surprised resistance,
to her lips; her last was to sink from her seat and to clasp his knees.I must deal most
untruly by you, and break a solemn engagement.You have my friendship, my
highest regard, my most sincere gratitude; you have more,--you have my
word and my faith; but--oh, forgive me, for the fault is not mine--you
have not my love, and I cannot marry you without a sin!""You dream, my dearest Edith!"said Evandale, perplexed in the utmost
degree, "you let your imagination beguile you; this is but some delusion
of an over-sensitive mind.The person whom you preferred to me has been
long in a better world, where your unavailing regret cannot follow him,
or, if it could, would only diminish his happiness.""You are mistaken, Lord Evandale," said Edith, solemnly; "I am not a
sleep-walker or a madwoman.No, I could not have believed from any one
what I have seen.But, having seen him, I must believe mine own eyes."asked Lord Evandale, in great anxiety."Henry Morton," replied Edith, uttering these two words as if they were
her last, and very nearly fainting when she had done so."Miss Bellenden," said Lord Evandale, "you treat me like a fool or a
child.If you repent your engagement to me," he continued, indignantly,
"I am not a man to enforce it against your inclination; but deal with me
as a man, and forbear this trifling."He was about to go on, when he perceived, from her quivering eye and
pallid cheek, that nothing less than imposture was intended, and that by
whatever means her imagination had been so impressed, it was really
disturbed by unaffected awe and terror.He changed his tone, and exerted
all his eloquence in endeavouring to soothe and extract from her the
secret cause of such terror.she repeated,--"I saw Henry Morton stand at that window, and
look into the apartment at the moment I was on the point of abjuring him
for ever.His face was darker, thinner, and paler than it was wont to be;
his dress was a horseman's cloak, and hat looped down over his face; his
expression was like that he wore on that dreadful morning when he was
examined by Claverhouse at Tillietudlem.Ask your sister, ask Lady Emily,
if she did not see him as well as I. I know what has called him up,--he
came to upbraid me, that, while my heart was with him in the deep and
dead sea, I was about to give my hand to another.My lord, it is ended
between you and me; be the consequences what they will, she cannot marry
whose union disturbs the repose of the dead."said Evandale, as he paced the room, half mad himself with
surprise and vexation, "her fine understanding must be totally
overthrown, and that by the effort which she has made to comply with my
ill-timed, though well-meant, request.Without rest and attention her
health is ruined for ever."At this moment the door opened, and Halliday, who had been Lord
Evandale's principal personal attendant since they both left the Guards
on the Revolution, stumbled into the room with a countenance as pale and
ghastly as terror could paint it."What is the matter next, Halliday?""Any
discovery of the--"

He had just recollection sufficient to stop short in the midst of the
dangerous sentence."No, sir," said Halliday, "it is not that, nor anything like that; but I
have seen a ghost!"said Lord Evandale, forced altogether out
of his patience."Has all mankind sworn to go mad in order to drive me
so?"The ghost of Henry Morton, the Whig captain at Bothwell Bridge," replied
Halliday."He passed by me like a fire-flaught when I was in the garden!""This is midsummer madness," said Lord Evandale, "or there is some
strange villainy afloat.Jenny, attend your lady to her chamber, while I
endeavour to find a clue to all this."But Lord Evandale's inquiries were in vain.Jenny, who might have given
(had she chosen) a very satisfactory explanation, had an interest to
leave the matter in darkness; and interest was a matter which now weighed
principally with Jenny, since the possession of an active and
affectionate husband in her own proper right had altogether allayed her
spirit of coquetry.She had made the best use of the first moments of
confusion hastily to remove all traces of any one having slept in the
apartment adjoining to the parlour, and even to erase the mark of
footsteps beneath the window, through which she conjectured Morton's face
had been seen, while attempting, ere he left the garden, to gain one look
at her whom he had so long loved, and was now on the point of losing for
ever.That he had passed Halliday in the garden was equally clear; and
she learned from her elder boy, whom she had employed to have the
stranger's horse saddled and ready for his departure, that he had rushed
into the stable, thrown the child a broad gold piece, and, mounting his
horse, had ridden with fearful rapidity down towards the Clyde.The
secret was, therefore, in their own family, and Jenny was resolved it
should remain so."For, to be sure," she said, "although her lady and Halliday kend Mr.Morton by broad daylight, that was nae reason I suld own to kenning him
in the gloaming and by candlelight, and him keeping his face frae Cuddie
and me a' the time."So she stood resolutely upon the negative when examined by Lord Evandale.As for Halliday, he could only say that as he entered the garden-door,
the supposed apparition met him, walking swiftly, and with a visage on
which anger and grief appeared to be contending."He knew him well," he said, "having been repeatedly guard upon him, and
obliged to write down his marks of stature and visage in case of escape.But what should make him
haunt the country where he was neither hanged nor shot, he, the said
Halliday, did not pretend to conceive.Lady Emily confessed she had seen the face of a man at the window, but
her evidence went no farther.John Gudyill deponed _nil novit in causa_.He had left his gardening to get his morning dram just at the time when
the apparition had taken place.Lady Emily's servant was waiting orders
in the kitchen, and there was not another being within a quarter of a
mile of the house.Lord Evandale returned perplexed and dissatisfied in the highest degree
at beholding a plan which he thought necessary not less for the
protection of Edith in contingent circumstances, than for the assurance
of his own happiness, and which he had brought so very near perfection,
thus broken off without any apparent or rational cause.His knowledge of
Edith's character set her beyond the suspicion of covering any capricious
change of determination by a pretended vision.But he would have set the
apparition down to the influence of an overstrained imagination, agitated
by the circumstances in which she had so suddenly been placed, had it not
been for the coinciding testimony of Halliday, who had no reason for
thinking of Morton more than any other person, and knew nothing of Miss
Bellenden's vision when he promulgated his own.On the other hand, it
seemed in the highest degree improbable that Morton, so long and so
vainly sought after, and who was, with such good reason, supposed to be
lost when the "Vryheid" of Rotterdam went down with crew and passengers,
should be alive and lurking in this country, where there was no longer
any reason why he should not openly show himself, since the present
Government favoured his party in politics.When Lord Evandale reluctantly
brought himself to communicate these doubts to the chaplain, in order to
obtain his opinion, he could only obtain a long lecture on demonology, in
which, after quoting Delrio and Burthoog and De L'Ancre on the subject of
apparitions, together with sundry civilians and common lawyers on the
nature of testimony, the learned gentleman expressed his definite and
determined opinion to be, either that there had been an actual apparition
of the deceased Henry Morton's spirit, the possibility of which he was,
as a divine and a philosopher, neither fully prepared to admit or to
deny; or else that the said Henry Morton, being still in _rerum natura_,
had appeared in his proper person that morning; or, finally, that some
strong _deceptio visus_, or striking similitude of person, had deceived
the eyes of Miss Bellenden and of Thomas Halliday.Which of these was the
most probable hypothesis, the doctor declined to pronounce, but expressed
himself ready to die in the opinion that one or other of them had
occasioned that morning's disturbance.Lord Evandale soon had additional cause for distressful anxiety.Miss
Bellenden was declared to be dangerously ill."I will not leave this place," he exclaimed, "till she is pronounced to
be in safety.I neither can nor ought to do so; for whatever may have
been the immediate occasion of her illness, I gave the first cause for it
by my unhappy solicitation."He established himself, therefore, as a guest in the family, which the
presence of his sister, as well as of Lady Margaret Bellenden (who, in
despite of her rheumatism, caused herself to be transported thither when
she heard of her granddaughter's illness), rendered a step equally
natural and delicate.And thus he anxiously awaited until, without injury
to her health, Edith could sustain a final explanation ere his departure
on his expedition."She shall never," said the generous young man, "look on her engagement
with me as the means of fettering her to a union, the idea of which seems
almost to unhinge her understanding."Where once my careless childhood strayed,
               A stranger yet to pain.Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College.It is not by corporal wants and infirmities only that men of the most
distinguished talents are levelled, during their lifetime, with the
common mass of mankind.There are periods of mental agitation when the
firmest of mortals must be ranked with the weakest of his brethren, and
when, in paying the general tax of humanity, his distresses are even
aggravated by feeling that he transgresses, in the indulgence of his
grief, the rules of religion and philosophy by which he endeavours in
general to regulate his passions and his actions.It was during such a
paroxysm that the unfortunate Morton left Fairy Knowe.To know that his
long-loved and still-beloved Edith, whose image had filled his mind for
so many years, was on the point of marriage to his early rival, who had
laid claim to her heart by so many services as hardly left her a title to
refuse his addresses, bitter as the intelligence was, yet came not as an
unexpected blow.During his residence abroad he had once written to Edith.It was to bid
her farewell for ever, and to conjure her to forget him.He had requested
her not to answer his letter; yet he half hoped, for many a day, that she
might transgress his injunction.The letter never reached her to whom it
was addressed, and Morton, ignorant of its miscarriage, could only
conclude himself laid aside and forgotten, according to his own
self-denying request.All that he had heard of their mutual relations
since his return to Scotland prepared him to expect that he could only
look upon Miss Bellenden as the betrothed bride of Lord Evandale; and
even if freed from the burden of obligation to the latter, it would still
have been inconsistent with Morton's generosity of disposition to disturb
their arrangements, by attempting the assertion of a claim proscribed by
absence, never sanctioned by the consent of friends, and barred by a
thousand circumstances of difficulty.Why then did he seek the cottage
which their broken fortunes had now rendered the retreat of Lady Margaret
Bellenden and her granddaughter?He yielded, we are under the necessity
of acknowledging, to the impulse of an inconsistent wish which many might
have felt in his situation.Accident apprised him, while travelling towards his native district, that
the ladies, near whose mansion he must necessarily pass, were absent; and
learning that Cuddie and his wife acted as their principal domestics, he
could not resist pausing at their cottage to learn, if possible, the real
progress which Lord Evandale had made in the affections of Miss Bellen
den--alas!This rash experiment ended as we have
related, and he parted from the house of Fairy Knowe, conscious that he
was still beloved by Edith, yet compelled, by faith and honour, to
relinquish her for ever.With what feelings he must have listened to the
dialogue between Lord Evandale and Edith, the greater part of which he
involuntarily overheard, the reader must conceive, for we dare not
attempt to describe them.An hundred times he was tempted to burst upon
their interview, or to exclaim aloud, "Edith, I yet live!"and as often
the recollection of her plighted troth, and of the debt of gratitude
which he owed Lord Evandale (to whose influence with Claverhouse he
justly ascribed his escape from torture and from death), withheld him
from a rashness which might indeed have involved all in further distress,
but gave little prospect of forwarding his own happiness.He repressed
forcibly these selfish emotions, though with an agony which thrilled his
every nerve.was his internal oath, "never will I add a thorn to thy
pillow.That which Heaven has ordained, let it be; and let me not add, by
my selfish sorrows, one atom's weight to the burden thou hast to bear.I
was dead to thee when thy resolution was adopted; and never, never shalt
thou know that Henry Morton still lives!"As he formed this resolution, diffident of his own power to keep it, and
seeking that firmness in flight which was every moment shaken by his
continuing within hearing of Edith's voice, he hastily rushed from his
apartment by the little closet and the sashed door which led to the
garden.But firmly as he thought his resolution was fixed, he could not leave the
spot where the last tones of a voice so beloved still vibrated on his
ear, without endeavouring to avail himself of the opportunity which the
parlour window afforded to steal one last glance at the lovely speaker.It was in this attempt, made while Edith seemed to have her eyes
unalterably bent upon the ground, that Morton's presence was detected by
her raising them suddenly.So soon as her wild scream made this known to
the unfortunate object of a passion so constant, and which seemed so
ill-fated, he hurried from the place as if pursued by the furies.He
passed Halliday in the garden without recognising or even being sensible
that he had seen him, threw himself on his horse, and, by a sort of
instinct rather than recollection, took the first by-road in preference
to the public route to Hamilton.In all probability this prevented Lord Evandale from learning that he was
actually in existence; for the news that the Highlanders had obtained a
decisive victory at Killiecrankie had occasioned an accurate look-out to
be kept, by order of the Government, on all the passes, for fear of some
commotion among the Lowland Jacobites.They did not omit to post
sentinels on Bothwell Bridge; and as these men had not seen any traveller
pass westward in that direction, and as, besides, their comrades
stationed in the village of Bothwell were equally positive that none had
gone eastward, the apparition, in the existence of which Edith and
Halliday were equally positive, became yet more mysterious in the
judgment of Lord Evandale, who was finally inclined to settle in the
belief that the heated and disturbed imagination of Edith had summoned up
the phantom she stated herself to have seen, and that Halliday had, in
some unaccountable manner, been infected by the same superstition.Meanwhile, the by-path which Morton pursued, with all the speed which his
vigorous horse could exert, brought him in a very few seconds to the
brink of the Clyde, at a spot marked with the feet of horses, who were
conducted to it as a watering-place.The steed, urged as he was to the
gallop, did not pause a single instant, but, throwing himself into the
river, was soon beyond his depth.The plunge which the animal made as his
feet quitted the ground, with the feeling that the cold water rose above
his swordbelt, were the first incidents which recalled Morton, whose
movements had been hitherto mechanical, to the necessity of taking
measures for preserving himself and the noble animal which he bestrode.A
perfect master of all manly exercises, the management of a horse in water
was as familiar to him as when upon a meadow.He directed the animal's
course somewhat down the stream towards a low plain, or holm, which
seemed to promise an easy egress from the river.In the first and second
attempt to get on shore, the horse was frustrated by the nature of the
ground, and nearly fell backwards on his rider.The instinct of
self-preservation seldom fails, even in the most desperate circumstances,
to recall the human mind to some degree of equipoise, unless when
altogether distracted by terror, and Morton was obliged to the danger in
which he was placed for complete recovery of his self-possession.A third
attempt, at a spot more carefully and judiciously selected, succeeded
better than the former, and placed the horse and his rider in safety upon
the farther and left-hand bank of the Clyde."But whither," said Morton, in the bitterness of his heart, "am I now to
direct my course?or rather, what does it signify to which point of the
compass a wretch so forlorn betakes himself?I would to God, could the
wish be without a sin, that these dark waters had flowed over me, and
drowned my recollection of that which was, and that which is!"The sense of impatience, which the disturbed state of his feelings had
occasioned, scarcely had vented itself in these violent expressions, ere
he was struck with shame at having given way to such a paroxysm.He
remembered how signally the life which he now held so lightly in the
bitterness of his disappointment had been preserved through the almost
incessant perils which had beset him since he entered upon his public
career.he said, "and worse than a fool, to set light by that
existence which Heaven has so often preserved in the most marvellous
manner.Something there yet remains for me in this world, were it only to
bear my sorrows like a man, and to aid those who need my assistance.What
have I seen, what have I heard, but the very conclusion of that which I
knew was to happen?They"--he durst not utter their names even in
soliloquy--"they are embarrassed and in difficulties.She is stripped of
her inheritance, and he seems rushing on some dangerous career, with
which, but for the low voice in which he spoke, I might have become
acquainted.Are there no means to aid or to warn them?"As he pondered upon this topic, forcibly withdrawing his mind from his
own disappointment, and compelling his attention to the affairs of Edith
and her betrothed husband, the letter of Burley, long forgotten, suddenly
rushed on his memory, like a ray of light darting through a mist."Their ruin must have been his work," was his internal conclusion."If it
can be repaired, it must be through his means, or by information obtained
from him.Stern, crafty, and enthusiastic as he
is, my plain and downright rectitude of purpose has more than once
prevailed with him.I will seek him out, at least; and who knows what
influence the information I may acquire from him may have on the fortunes
of those whom I shall never see more, and who will probably never learn
that I am now suppressing my own grief, to add, if possible, to their
happiness."Animated by these hopes, though the foundation was but slight, he sought
the nearest way to the high-road; and as all the tracks through the
valley were known to him since he hunted through them in youth, he had no
other difficulty than that of surmounting one or two enclosures, ere he
found himself on the road to the small burgh where the feast of the
popinjay had been celebrated.He journeyed in a state of mind sad indeed
and dejected, yet relieved from its earlier and more intolerable state of
anguish; for virtuous resolution and manly disinterestedness seldom fail
to restore tranquillity even where they cannot create happiness.He
turned his thoughts with strong effort upon the means of discovering
Burley, and the chance there was of extracting from him any knowledge
which he might possess favourable to her in whose cause he interested
himself; and at length formed the resolution of guiding himself by the
circumstances in which he might discover the object of his quest,
trusting that, from Cuddie's account of a schism betwixt Burley and his
brethren of the Presbyterian persuasion, he might find him less
rancorously disposed against Miss Bellenden, and inclined to exert the
power which he asserted himself to possess over her fortunes, more
favourably than heretofore.Noontide had passed away when our traveller found himself in the
neighbourhood of his deceased uncle's habitation of Milnwood.It rose
among glades and groves that were chequered with a thousand early
recollections of joy and sorrow, and made upon Morton that mournful
impression, soft and affecting, yet, withal, soothing, which the
sensitive mind usually receives from a return to the haunts of childhood
and early youth, after having experienced the vicissitudes and tempests
of public life.A strong desire came upon him to visit the house itself."Old Alison," he thought, "will not know me, more than the honest couple
whom I saw yesterday.I may indulge my curiosity, and proceed on my
journey, without her having any knowledge of my existence.I think they
said my uncle had bequeathed to her my family mansion,--well, be it so.I
have enough to sorrow for, to enable me to dispense with lamenting such a
disappointment as that; and yet methinks he has chosen an odd successor
in my grumbling old dame, to a line of respectable, if not distinguished,
ancestry.Let it be as it may, I will visit the old mansion at least once
more."The house of Milnwood, even in its best days, had nothing cheerful about
it; but its gloom appeared to be doubled under the auspices of the old
housekeeper.Everything, indeed, was in repair; there were no slates
deficient upon the steep grey roof, and no panes broken in the narrow
windows.But the grass in the court-yard looked as if the foot of man had
not been there for years; the doors were carefully locked, and that which
admitted to the hall seemed to have been shut for a length of time, since
the spiders had fairly drawn their webs over the door-way and the
staples.Living sight or sound there was none, until, after much
knocking, Morton heard the little window, through which it was
usual to reconnoitre visitors, open with much caution.The face of
Alison, puckered with some score of wrinkles in addition to those with
which it was furrowed when Morton left Scotland, now presented itself,
enveloped in a _toy_, from under the protection of which some of her grey
tresses had escaped in a manner more picturesque than beautiful, while
her shrill, tremulous voice demanded the cause of the knocking."I wish to speak an instant with one Alison Wilson, who resides here,"
said Henry."She's no at hame the day," answered Mrs.Wilson, _in propria persona_,
the state of whose headdress, perhaps, inspired her with this direct mode
of denying herself; "and ye are but a mislear'd person to speer for her
in sic a manner.Ye might hae had an M under your belt for Mistress
Wilson of Milnwood.""I beg pardon," said Morton, internally smiling at finding in old Ailie
the same jealousy of disrespect which she used to exhibit upon former
occasions,--"I beg pardon; I am but a stranger in this country, and have
been so long abroad that I have almost forgotten my own language."said Ailie; "then maybe ye may hae
heard of a young gentleman of this country that they ca' Henry Morton?""I have heard," said Morton, "of such a name in Germany.""Then bide a wee bit where ye are, friend; or stay,--gang round by the
back o' the house, and ye'll find a laigh door; it's on the latch, for
it's never barred till sunset.Ye 'll open 't,--and tak care ye dinna fa'
ower the tub, for the entry's dark,--and then ye'll turn to the right,
and then ye'll hand straught forward, and then ye'll turn to the right
again, and ye 'll tak heed o' the cellarstairs, and then ye 'll be at the
door o' the little kitchen,--it's a' the kitchen that's at Milnwood
now,--and I'll come down t'ye, and whate'er ye wad say to Mistress
Wilson ye may very safely tell it to me."A stranger might have had some difficulty, notwithstanding the minuteness
of the directions supplied by Ailie, to pilot himself in safety through
the dark labyrinth of passages that led from the back-door to the little
kitchen; but Henry was too well acquainted with the navigation of these
straits to experience danger, either from the Scylla which lurked on one
side in shape of a bucking tub, or the Charybdis which yawned on the
other in the profundity of a winding cellar-stair.His only impediment
arose from the snarling and vehement barking of a small cocking spaniel,
once his own property, but which, unlike to the faithful Argus, saw his
master return from his wanderings without any symptom of recognition.said Morton to himself, on being disowned by
his former favourite."I am so changed that no breathing creature that I
have known and loved will now acknowledge me!"At this moment he had reached the kitchen; and soon after, the tread of
Alison's high heels, and the pat of the crutch-handled cane which served
at once to prop and to guide her footsteps, were heard upon the
stairs,--an annunciation which continued for some time ere she fairly
reached the kitchen.Morton had, therefore, time to survey the slender preparations for
housekeeping which were now sufficient in the house of his ancestors.The
fire, though coals are plenty in that neighbourhood, was husbanded with
the closest attention to economy of fuel, and the small pipkin, in which
was preparing the dinner of the old woman and her maid-of-all-work, a
girl of twelve years old, intimated, by its thin and watery vapour, that
Ailie had not mended her cheer with her improved fortune.When she entered, the head, which nodded with self-importance; the
features, in which an irritable peevishness, acquired by habit and
indulgence, strove with a temper naturally affectionate and good-natured;
the coif; the apron; the blue-checked gown,--were all those of old Ailie;
but laced pinners, hastily put on to meet the stranger, with some other
trifling articles of decoration, marked the difference between Mrs.Wilson, life-rentrix of Milnwood, and the housekeeper of the late
proprietor."What were ye pleased to want wi' Mrs.Wilson,"
was her first address; for the five minutes time which she had gained for
the business of the toilet entitled her, she conceived, to assume the
full merit of her illustrious name, and shine forth on her guest in
unchastened splendour.Morton's sensations, confounded between the past
and present, fairly confused him so much that he would have had
difficulty in answering her, even if he had known well what to say.But
as he had not determined what character he was to adopt while concealing
that which was properly his own, he had an additional reason for
remaining silent.Wilson, in perplexity, and with some apprehension,
repeated her question."What were ye pleased to want wi' me, sir?"Pardon me, madam," answered Henry, "it was of one Silas Morton I spoke.""It was his father, then, ye kent o', the brother o' the late Milnwood?Ye canna mind him abroad, I wad think,--he was come hame afore ye were
born.I thought ye had brought me news of poor Maister Harry.""It was from my father I learned to know Colonel Morton," said Henry; "of
the son I know little or nothing,--rumour says he died abroad on his
passage to Holland.""That's ower like to be true," said the old woman with a sigh, "and mony
a tear it's cost my auld een.His uncle, poor gentleman, just sough'd awa
wi' it in his mouth.He had been gieing me preceeze directions anent the
bread and the wine and the brandy at his burial, and how often it was to
be handed round the company (for, dead or alive, he was a prudent,
frugal, painstaking man), and then he said, said he, 'Ailie,' (he aye
ca'd me Ailie; we were auld acquaintance), 'Ailie, take ye care and haud
the gear weel thegither; for the name of Morton of Milnwood's gane out
like the last sough of an auld sang.'And sae he fell out o' ae dwam into
another, and ne'er spak a word mair, unless it were something we cou'dna
mak out, about a dipped candle being gude eneugh to see to dee wi'.He
cou'd ne'er bide to see a moulded ane, and there was ane, by ill luck, on
the table."Wilson was thus detailing the last moments of the old miser,
Morton was pressingly engaged in diverting the assiduous curiosity of the
dog, which, recovered from his first surprise, and combining former
recollections, had, after much snuffing and examination, begun a course
of capering and jumping upon the stranger which threatened every instant
to betray him.At length, in the urgency of his impatience, Morton could
not forbear exclaiming, in a tone of hasty impatience, "Down, Elphin!"Ye ken our dog's name," said the old lady, struck with great and sudden
surprise,--"ye ken our dog's name, and it's no a common ane.And the
creature kens you too," she continued, in a more agitated and shriller
tone,--"God guide us!So saying, the poor old woman threw herself around Morton's neck, cling
to him, kissed him as if he had been actually her child, and wept for
joy.There was no parrying the discovery, if he could have had the heart
to attempt any further disguise.He returned the embrace with the most
grateful warmth, and answered,--

"I do indeed live, dear Ailie, to thank you for all your kindness, past
and present, and to rejoice that there is at least one friend to welcome
me to my native country."exclaimed Ailie, "ye'll hae mony friends,--ye 'll hae mony
friends; for ye will hae gear, hinny,--ye will hae gear.Heaven mak ye a
gude guide o't!she continued, pushing him back from her
with her trembling hand and shrivelled arm, and gazing in his face as if
to read, at more convenient distance, the ravages which sorrow rather
than time had made on his face,--"Eh, sirs!ye're sair altered, hinny;
your face is turned pale, and your een are sunken, and your bonny
red-and-white cheeks are turned a' dark and sun-burnt.mony's the comely face they destroy.--And when cam ye here, hinny?And what for did ye na
write to us?And how cam ye to pass yoursell for dead?And what for did
ye come creepin' to your ain house as if ye had been an unto body, to gie
poor auld Ailie sic a start?"It was some time ere Morton could overcome his own emotion so as to give
the kind old woman the information which we shall communicate to our
readers in the next chapter.Aumerle that was,
               But that is gone for being Richard's friend;
               And, madam, you must call him Rutland now.The scene of explanation was hastily removed from the little kitchen to
Mrs.Wilson's own matted room,--the very same which she had occupied as
housekeeper, and which she continued to retain."It was," she said,
"better secured against sifting winds than the hall, which she had found
dangerous to her rheumatisms, and it was more fitting for her use than
the late Milnwood's apartment, honest man, which gave her sad thoughts;"
and as for the great oak parlour, it was never opened but to be aired,
washed, and dusted, according to the invariable practice of the family,
unless upon their most solemn festivals.In the matted room, therefore,
they were settled, surrounded by pickle-pots and conserves of all kinds,
which the ci-devant housekeeper continued to compound, out of mere habit,
although neither she herself, nor any one else, ever partook of the
comfits which she so regularly prepared.Morton, adapting his narrative to the comprehension of his auditor,
informed her briefly of the wreck of the vessel and the loss of all
hands, excepting two or three common seamen who had early secured the
skiff, and were just putting off from the vessel when he leaped from the
deck into their boat, and unexpectedly, as well as contrary to their
inclination, made himself partner of their voyage and of their safety.Landed at Flushing, he was fortunate enough to meet with an old officer
who had been in service with his father.By his advice, he shunned going
immediately to the Hague, but forwarded his letters to the court of the
Stadtholder."Our prince," said the veteran, "must as yet keep terms with his
father-in-law and with your King Charles; and to approach him in the
character of a Scottish malecontent would render it imprudent for him to
distinguish you by his favour.Wait, therefore, his orders, without
forcing yourself on his notice; observe the strictest prudence and
retirement; assume for the present a different name; shun the company of
the British exiles; and, depend upon it, you will not repent your
prudence."The old friend of Silas Morton argued justly.After a considerable time
had elapsed, the Prince of Orange, in a progress through the United
States, came to the town where Morton, impatient at his situation and the
incognito which he was obliged to observe, still continued, nevertheless,
to be a resident.He had an hour of private interview assigned, in which
the prince expressed himself highly pleased with his intelligence, his
prudence, and the liberal view which he seemed to take of the factions of
his native country, their motives and their purposes."I would gladly," said William, "attach you to my own person; but that
cannot be without giving offence in England.But I will do as much for
you, as well out of respect for the sentiments you have expressed, as for
the recommendations you have brought me.Here is a commission in a Swiss
regiment at present in garrison in a distant province, where you will
meet few or none of your countrymen.Continue to be Captain Melville, and
let the name of Morton sleep till better days.""Thus began my fortune," continued Morton; "and my services have, on
various occasions, been distinguished by his Royal Highness, until the
moment that brought him to Britain as our political deliverer.His
commands must excuse my silence to my few friends in Scotland; and I
wonder not at the report of my death, considering the wreck of the
vessel, and that I found no occasion to use the letters of exchange with
which I was furnished by the liberality of some of them,--a circumstance
which must have confirmed the belief that I had perished.""But, dear hinny," asked Mrs.Wilson, "did ye find nae Scotch body at the
Prince of Oranger's court that kend ye?I wad hae thought Morton o'
Milnwood was kend a' through the country.""I was purposely engaged in distant service," said Morton, "until a
period when few, without as deep and kind a motive of interest as yours,
Ailie, would have known the stripling Morton in Major-General Melville.""Malville was your mother's name," said Mrs.Wilson; "but Morton sounds
far bonnier in my auld lugs.And when ye tak up the lairdship, ye maun
tak the auld name and designation again.""I am like to be in no haste to do either the one or the other, Ailie,
for I have some reasons for the present to conceal my being alive from
every one but you; and as for the lairdship of Milnwood, it is in as good
hands.""As gude hands, hinny!"re-echoed Ailie; "I'm hopefu' ye are no meaning
mine?The rents and the lands are but a sair fash to me.And I'm ower
failed to tak a helpmate, though Wylie Mactrickit the writer was very
pressing, and spak very civilly; but I'm ower auld a cat to draw that
strae before me.He canna whilliwhaw me as he's dune mony a ane.And then
I thought aye ye wad come back, and I wad get my pickle meal and my soup
milk, and keep a' things right about ye as I used to do in your puir
uncle's time, and it wad be just pleasure eneugh for me to see ye thrive
and guide the gear canny.Ye'll hae learned that in Holland, I'se
warrant, for they're thrifty folk there, as I hear tell.--But ye'll be
for keeping rather a mair house than puir auld Milnwood that's gave; and,
indeed, I would approve o' your eating butchermeat maybe as aften as
three times a-week,--it keeps the wind out o' the stamack.""We will talk of all this another time," said Morton, surprised at the
generosity upon a large scale which mingled in Ailie's thoughts and
actions with habitual and sordid parsimony, and at the odd contrast
between her love of saving and indifference to self-acquisition."You
must know," he continued, "that I am in this country only for a few days
on some special business of importance to the Government, and therefore,
Ailie, not a word of having seen me.At some other time I will acquaint
you fully with my motives and intentions.""E'en be it sae, my jo," replied Ailie, "I can keep a secret like my
neighbours; and weel auld Milnwood kend it, honest man, for he tauld me
where he keepit his gear, and that's what maist folk like to hae as
private as possibly may be.--But come awa wi' me, hinny, till I show ye
the oak-parlour how grandly it's keepit, just as if ye had been expected
haine every day,--I loot naebody sort it but my ain hands.It was a kind
o' divertisement to me, though whiles the tear wan into my ee, and I said
to mysell, What needs I fash wi' grates and carpets and cushions and the
muckle brass candlesticks ony mair?for they'll ne'er come hame that
aught it rightfully."With these words she hauled him away to this sanctum sanctorum, the
scrubbing and cleaning whereof was her daily employment, as its high
state of good order constituted the very pride of her heart.Morton, as
he followed her into the room, underwent a rebuke for not "dighting his
shune," which showed that Ailie had not relinquished her habits of
authority.On entering the oak-parlour he could not but recollect the
feelings of solemn awe with which, when a boy, he had been affected at
his occasional and rare admission to an apartment which he then supposed
had not its equal save in the halls of princes.It may be readily
supposed that the worked-worsted chairs, with their short ebony legs and
long upright backs, had lost much of their influence over his mind; that
the large brass andirons seemed diminished in splendour; that the green
worsted tapestry appeared no masterpiece of the Arras loom; and that the
room looked, on the whole, dark, gloomy, and disconsolate.Yet there were
two objects, "The counterfeit presentment of two brothers," which,
dissimilar as those described by Hamlet, affected his mind with a variety
of sensations.One full-length portrait represented his father in
complete armour, with a countenance indicating his masculine and
determined character; and the other set forth his uncle, in velvet and
brocade, looking as if he were ashamed of his own finery, though entirely
indebted for it to the liberality of the painter."It was an idle fancy," Ailie said, "to dress the honest auld man in thae
expensive fal-lalls that he ne'er wore in his life, instead o' his douce
Raploch grey, and his band wi' the narrow edging."In private, Morton could not help being much of her opinion; for anything
approaching to the dress of a gentleman sate as ill on the ungainly
person of his relative as an open or generous expression would have done
on his mean and money-making features.He now extricated himself from
Ailie to visit some of his haunts in the neighbouring wood, while her own
hands made an addition to the dinner she was preparing,--an incident no
otherwise remarkable than as it cost the life of a fowl, which, for any
event of less importance than the arrival of Henry Morton, might have
cackled on to a good old age ere Ailie could have been guilty of the
extravagance of killing and dressing it.The meal was seasoned by talk of
old times and by the plans which Ailie laid out for futurity, in which
she assigned her young master all the prudential habits of her old one,
and planned out the dexterity with which she was to exercise her duty as
governante.Morton let the old woman enjoy her day-dreams and
castle-building during moments of such pleasure, and deferred till some
fitter occasion the communication of his purpose again to return and
spend his life upon the Continent.His next care was to lay aside his military dress, which he considered
likely to render more difficult his researches after Burley.He exchanged
it--for a grey doublet and cloak, formerly his usual attire at Milnwood,
and which Mrs.Wilson produced from a chest of walnut-tree, wherein she
had laid them aside, without forgetting carefully to brush and air them
from time to time.Morton retained his sword and fire-arms, without which
few persons travelled in those unsettled times.When he appeared in his
new attire, Mrs.Wilson was first thankful "that they fitted him sae
decently, since, though he was nae fatter, yet he looked mair manly than
when he was taen frae Milnwood."Next she enlarged on the advantage of saving old clothes to be what she
called "beet-masters to the new," and was far advanced in the history of
a velvet cloak belonging to the late Milnwood, which had first been
converted to a velvet doublet, and then into a pair of breeches, and
appeared each time as good as new, when Morton interrupted her account of
its transmigration to bid her good-by.He gave, indeed, a sufficient shock to her feelings, by expressing the
necessity he was under of proceeding on his journey that evening.And whar wad ye
sleep but in your ain house, after ye hae been sae mony years frae hame?""I feel all the unkindness of it, Ailie, but it must be so; and that was
the reason that I attempted to conceal myself from you, as I suspected
you would not let me part from you so easily.""But whar are ye gaun, then?""Saw e'er mortal een
the like o' you, just to come ae moment, and flee awa like an arrow out
of a bow the neist?""I must go down," replied Morton, "to Niel Blane the Piper's Howff; he
can give me a bed, I suppose?"I'se warrant can he," replied Ailie, "and gar ye pay weel for 't
into the bargain.Laddie, I daresay ye hae lost your wits in thae foreign
parts, to gang and gie siller for a supper and a bed, and might hae baith
for naething, and thanks t' ye for accepting them.""I assure you, Ailie," said Morton, desirous to silence her
remonstrances, "that this is a business of great importance, in which I
may be a great gainer, and cannot possibly be a loser.""I dinna see how that can be, if ye begin by gieing maybe the feck o'
twal shillings Scots for your supper; but young folks are aye
venturesome, and think to get siller that way.My puir auld master took
a surer gate, and never parted wi' it when he had anes gotten 't."Persevering in his desperate resolution, Morton took leave of Ailie, and
mounted his horse to proceed to the little town, after exacting a solemn
promise that she would conceal his return until she again saw or heard
from him."I am not very extravagant," was his natural reflection, as he trotted
slowly towards the town; "but were Ailie and I to set up house together,
as she proposes, I think my profusion would break the good old creature's
heart before a week were out."Where's the jolly host
               You told me of?'T has been my custom ever
               To parley with mine host.Morton reached the borough town without meeting with any remarkable
adventure, and alighted at the little inn.It had occurred to him more
than once, while upon his journey, that his resumption of the dress which
he had worn while a youth, although favourable to his views in other
respects, might render it more difficult for him to remain incognito.But
a few years of campaigns and wandering had so changed his appearance that
he had great confidence that in the grown man, whose brows exhibited the
traces of resolution and considerate thought, none would recognise the
raw and bashful stripling who won the game of the popinjay.The only
chance was that here and there some Whig, whom he had led to battle,
might remember the Captain of the Milnwood Marksmen; but the risk, if
there was any, could not be guarded against.The Howff seemed full and frequented as if possessed of all its old
celebrity.The person and demeanour of Niel Blane, more fat and less
civil than of yore, intimated that he had increased as well in purse as
in corpulence; for in Scotland a landlord's complaisance for his guests
decreases in exact proportion to his rise in the world.His daughter had
acquired the air of a dexterous barmaid, undisturbed by the circumstances
of love and war, so apt to perplex her in the exercise of her vocation.Both showed Morton the degree of attention which could have been expected
by a stranger travelling without attendants, at a time when they were
particularly the badges of distinction.He took upon himself exactly the
character his appearance presented, went to the stable and saw his horse
accommodated, then returned to the house, and seating himself in the
public room (for to request one to himself would, in those days, have
been thought an overweening degree of conceit), he found himself in the
very apartment in which he had some years before celebrated his victory
at the game of the popinjay,--a jocular preferment which led to so many
serious consequences.He felt himself, as may well be supposed, a much changed man since that
festivity; and yet, to look around him, the groups assembled in the Howff
seemed not dissimilar to those which the same scene had formerly
presented.Two or three burghers husbanded their "dribbles o' brandy;"
two or three dragoons lounged over their muddy ale, and cursed the
inactive times that allowed them no better cheer.Their cornet did not,
indeed, play at backgammon with the curate in his cassock, but he drank
a little modicum of _aqua mirabilis_ with the grey-cloaked Presbyterian
minister.The scene was another, and yet the same, differing only in
persons, but corresponding in general character.Let the tide of the world wax or wane as it will, Morton thought as he
looked around him, enough will be found to fill the places which chance
renders vacant; and in the usual occupations and amusements of life,
human beings will succeed each other as leaves upon the same tree, with
the same individual difference and the same general resemblance.After pausing a few minutes, Morton, whose experience had taught him the
readiest mode of securing attention, ordered a pint of claret; and as the
smiling landlord appeared with the pewter measure foaming fresh from the
tap (for bottling wine was not then in fashion), he asked him to sit down
and take a share of the good cheer.This invitation was peculiarly
acceptable to Niel Blane, who, if he did not positively expect it from
every guest not provided with better company, yet received it from many,
and was not a whit abashed or surprised at the summons.He sat down,
along with his guest, in a secluded nook near the chimney; and while he
received encouragement to drink by far the greater share of the liquor
before them, he entered at length, as a part of his expected functions,
upon the news of the country,--the births, deaths, and marriages; the
change of property; the downfall of old families, and the rise of new.But politics, now the fertile source of eloquence, mine host did not care
to mingle in his theme; and it was only in answer to a question of Morton
that he replied, with an air of indifference, "Um!we aye hae sodgers
amang us, mair or less.There's a wheen German horse down at Glasgow
yonder; they ca' their commander Wittybody, or some sic name, though he's
as grave and grewsome an auld Dutchman as e'er I saw."said Morton,--"an old man, with grey hair and
short black moustaches; speaks seldom?""And smokes for ever," replied Niel Blane."I see your honour kens the
man.He may be a very gude man too, for aught I see,--that is,
considering he is a sodger and a Dutchman; but if he were ten generals,
and as mony Wittybodies, he has nae skill in the pipes; he gar'd me stop
in the middle of Torphichen's Rant,--the best piece o' music that ever
bag gae wind to.""But these fellows," said Morton, glancing his eye towards the soldiers
"that were in the apartment, are not of his corps?""Na, na, these are Scotch dragoons," said mine host,--"our ain auld
caterpillars; these were Claver'se's lads a while syne, and wad be again,
maybe, if he had the lang ten in his hand.""Is there not a report of his death?""Troth is there," said the landlord; "your honour is right,--there is sic
a fleeing rumour; but, in my puir opinion, it's lang or the deil die.I
wad hae the folks here look to themsells.If he makes an outbreak, he'll
be doun frae the Hielands or I could drink this glass,--and whare are
they then?A' thae hell-rakers o' dragoons wad be at his whistle in a
moment.Nae doubt they're Willie's men e'en now, as they were James's a
while syne; and reason good,--they fight for their pay; what else hae
they to fight for?They hae neither lands nor houses, I trow.There's ae
gude thing o' the change, or the Revolution, as they ca' it,--folks may
speak out afore thae birkies now, and nae fear o' being hauled awa to the
guard-house, or having the thumikins screwed on your finger-ends, just as
I wad drive the screw through a cork."There was a little pause, when Morton, feeling confident in the progress
he had made in mine host's familiarity, asked, though with the hesitation
proper to one who puts a question on the answer to which rests something
of importance, "Whether Blane knew a woman in that neighbourhood called
Elizabeth Maclure?""Whether I ken Bessie Maclure?"answered the landlord, with a landlord's
laugh,--"How can I but ken my ain wife's (haly be her rest!)--my ain
wife's first gudeman's sister, Bessie Maclure?An honest wife she is, but
sair she's been trysted wi' misfortunes,--the loss o' twa decent lads o'
sons, in the time o' the persecution, as they ca' it nowadays; and
doucely and decently she has borne her burden, blaming nane and
condemning nane.If there's an honest woman in the world, it's Bessie
Maclure.And to lose her twa sons, as I was saying, and to hae dragoons
clinked down on her for a month bypast,--for, be Whig or Tory uppermost,
they aye quarter thae loons on victuallers,--to lose, as I was saying--"

"This woman keeps an inn, then?""A public, in a puir way," replied Blane, looking round at his own
superior accommodations,--"a sour browst o' sma' ale that she sells to
folk that are over drouthy wi' travel to be nice; but naething to ca' a
stirring trade or a thriving changehouse.""Your honour will rest here a' the night?Ye'll hardly get accommodation
at Bessie's," said Niel, whose regard for his deceased wife's relative by
no means extended to sending company from his own house to hers."There is a friend," answered Morton, "whom I am to meet with there, and
I only called here to take a stirrup-cup and inquire the way.""Your honour had better," answerd the landlord, with the perseverance of
his calling, "send some ane to warn your friend to come on here.""I tell you, landlord," answered Morton, impatiently, "that will not
serve my purpose; I must go straight to this woman Maclure's house, and
I desire you to find me a guide.""Aweel, sir, ye'll choose for yoursell, to be sure," said Niel Blane,
somewhat disconcerted; "but deil a guide ye'll need if ye gae doun the
water for twa mile or sae, as gin ye were bound for Milnwoodhouse, and
then tak the first broken disjasked-looking road that makes for the
hills,--ye'll ken 't by a broken ash-tree that stands at the side o' a
burn just where the roads meet; and then travel out the path,--ye canna
miss Widow Maclure's public, for deil another house or hauld is on the
road for ten lang Scots miles, and that's worth twenty English.I am
sorry your honour would think o' gaun out o' my house the night.But my
wife's gude-sister is a decent woman, and it's no lost that a friend
gets."Morton accordingly paid his reckoning and departed.The sunset of the
summer day placed him at the ash-tree, where the path led up towards the
moors."Here," he said to himself, "my misfortunes commenced; for just here,
when Burley and I were about to separate on the first night we ever met,
he was alarmed by the intelligence that the passes were secured by
soldiers lying in wait for him.Beneath that very ash sate the old woman
who apprised him of his danger.How strange that my whole fortunes should
have become inseparably interwoven with that man's, without anything more
on my part than the discharge of an ordinary duty of humanity!Would to
Heaven it were possible I could find my humble quiet and tranquillity of
mind upon the spot where I lost them!"Thus arranging his reflections betwixt speech and thought, he turned his
horse's head up the path.Evening lowered around him as he advanced up the narrow dell which had
once been a wood, but was now a ravine divested of trees, unless where a
few, from their inaccessible situation on the edge of precipitous banks,
or clinging among rocks and huge stones, defied the invasion of men and
of cattle, like the scattered tribes of a conquered country, driven to
take refuge in the barren strength of its mountains.These too, wasted
and decayed, seemed rather to exist than to flourish, and only served to
indicate what the landscape had once been.But the stream brawled down
among them in all its freshness and vivacity, giving the life and
animation which a mountain rivulet alone can confer on the barest and
most savage scenes, and which the inhabitants of such a country miss when
gazing even upon the tranquil winding of a majestic stream through plains
of fertility, and beside palaces of splendour.The track of the road
followed the course of the brook, which was now visible, and now only to
be distinguished by its brawling heard among the stones or in the clefts
of the rock that occasionally interrupted its course."Murmurer that thou art," said Morton, in the enthusiasm of his reverie,
"why chafe with the rocks that stop thy course for a moment?There is a
sea to receive thee in its bosom; and there is an eternity for man when
his fretful and hasty course through the vale of time shall be ceased and
over.What thy petty fuming is to the deep and vast billows of a
shoreless ocean, are our cares, hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows to the
objects which must occupy us through the awful and boundless succession
of ages!"Thus moralizing, our traveller passed on till the dell opened, and the
banks, receding from the brook, left a little green vale, exhibiting a
croft, or small field, on which some corn was growing, and a cottage,
whose walls were not above five feet high, and whose thatched roof, green
with moisture, age, houseleek, and grass, had in some places suffered
damage from the encroachment of two cows, whose appetite this appearance
of verdure had diverted from their more legitimate pasture.An ill-spelt
and worse-written inscription intimated to the traveller that he might
here find refreshment for man and horse,--no unacceptable intimation,
rude as the hut appeared to be, considering the wild path he had trod in
approaching it, and the high and waste mountains which rose in desolate
dignity behind this humble asylum.It must indeed have been, thought Morton, in some such spot as this that
Burley was likely to find a congenial confident.As he approached, he observed the good dame of the house herself, seated
by the door; she had hitherto been concealed from him by a huge
alder-bush."Good evening, Mother," said the traveller."Your name is Mistress
Maclure?""Elizabeth Maclure, sir, a poor widow," was the reply."Can you lodge a stranger for a night?""I can, sir, if he will be pleased with the widow's cake and the widow's
cruse.""I have been a soldier, good dame," answered Morton, "and nothing can
come amiss to me in the way of entertainment."said the old woman, with a sigh,--"God send ye a better
trade!""It is believed to be an honourable profession, my good dame; I hope you
do not think the worse of me for having belonged to it?""I judge no one, sir," replied the woman, "and your voice sounds like
that of a civil gentleman; but I hae witnessed sae muckle ill wi'
sodgering in this puir land that I am e'en content that I can see nae
mair o't wi' these sightless organs."As she spoke thus, Morton observed that she was blind."Shall I not be troublesome to you, my good dame?"said he,
compassionately; "your infirmity seems ill calculated for your
profession.""Na, sir," answered the old woman, "I can gang about the house readily
eneugh; and I hae a bit lassie to help me, and the dragoon lads will look
after your horse when they come hame frae their patrol, for a sma'
matter; they are civiller now than lang syne.""Peggy, my bonny bird," continued the hostess, addressing a little girl
of twelve years old, who had by this time appeared, "tak the gentleman's
horse to the stable, and slack his girths, and tak aff the bridle, and
shake down a lock o' hay before him, till the dragoons come back.--Come
this way, sir," she continued; "ye'll find my house clean, though it's a
puir ane."Morton followed her into the cottage accordingly.Then out and spake the auld mother,
               And fast her tears did fa
               "Ye wadna be warn'd, my son Johnie,
               Frae the hunting to bide awa!"When he entered the cottage, Morton perceived that the old hostess had
spoken truth.The inside of the hut belied its outward appearance, and
was neat, and even comfortable, especially the inner apartment, in which
the hostess informed her guest that he was to sup and sleep.Refreshments
were placed before him such as the little inn afforded; and though he had
small occasion for them, he accepted the offer, as the means of
maintaining some discourse with the landlady.Notwithstanding her
blindness, she was assiduous in her attendance, and seemed, by a sort of
instinct, to find her way to what she wanted."Have you no one but this pretty little girl to assist you in waiting on
your guests?""None, sir," replied his old hostess; "I dwell alone, like the widow of
Zarephath.Few guests come to this puir place, and I haena custom eneugh
to hire servants.I had anes twa fine sons that lookit after a' thing.--But God gives and takes away,--His name be praised!"she continued,
turning her clouded eyes towards Heaven.--"I was anes better off, that
is, waridly speaking, even since I lost them; but that was before this
last change."said Morton; "and yet you are a Presbyterian, my good mother?""I am, sir; praised be the light that showed me the right way," replied
the landlady."Then I should have thought," continued the guest, "the Revolution would
have brought you nothing but good.""If," said the old woman, "it has brought the land gude, and freedom of
worship to tender consciences, it's little matter what it has brought to
a puir blind worm like me.""Still," replied Morton, "I cannot see how it could possibly injure you.""It's a lang story, sir," answered his hostess, with a sigh."But ae
night, sax weeks or thereby afore Bothwell Brigg, a young gentleman
stopped at this puir cottage, stiff and bloody with wounds, pale and dune
out wi' riding, and his horse sae weary he couldna drag ae foot after the
other, and his foes were close ahint him, and he was ane o' our enemies.You that's a sodger will think me but a silly auld
wife; but I fed him, and relieved him, and keepit him hidden till the
pursuit was ower.""And who," said Morton, "dares disapprove of your having done so?""I kenna," answered the blind woman; "I gat ill-will about it amang some
o' our ain folk.They said I should hae been to him what Jael was to
Sisera.But weel I wot I had nae divine command to shed blood, and to
save it was baith like a woman and a Christian.And then they said I
wanted natural affection, to relieve ane that belanged to the band that
murdered my twa sons.""Ay, sir; though maybe ye'll gie their deaths another name.The tane fell
wi' sword in hand, fighting for a broken national Covenant; the
tother,--oh, they took him and shot him dead on the green before his
mother's face!My auld een dazzled when the shots were looten off, and,
to my thought, they waxed weaker and weaker ever since that weary day;
and sorrow, and heart-break, and tears that would not be dried, might
help on the disorder.betraying Lord Evandale's young blood
to his enemies' sword wad ne'er hae brought my Ninian and Johnie alive
again.""Was it Lord Evandale whose
life you saved?""In troth, even his," she replied."And kind he was to me after, and gae
me a cow and calf, malt, meal, and siller, and nane durst steer me when
he was in power.But we live on an outside bit of Tillietudlem land, and
the estate was sair plea'd between Leddy Margaret Bellenden and the
present laird, Basil Olifant, and Lord Evandale backed the auld leddy for
love o' her daughter Miss Edith, as the country said, ane o' the best and
bonniest lassies in Scotland.But they behuved to gie way, and Basil gat
the Castle and land, and on the back o' that came the Revolution, and wha
to turn coat faster than the laird?for he said he had been a true Whig
a' the time, and turned <DW7> only for fashion's sake.And then he got
favour, and Lord Evandale's head was under water; for he was ower proud
and manfu' to bend to every blast o' wind, though mony a ane may ken as
weel as me that be his ain principles as they might, he was nae ill
friend to our folk when he could protect us, and far kinder than Basil
Olifant, that aye keepit the cobble head doun the stream.But he was set
by and ill looked on, and his word ne'er asked; and then Basil, wha's a
revengefu' man, set himsell to vex him in a' shapes, and especially by
oppressing and despoiling the auld blind widow, Bessie Maclure, that
saved Lord Evandale's life, and that he was sae kind to.But he's mistaen
if that's his end; for it will be lang or Lord Evandale hears a word frae
me about the selling my kye for rent or e'er it was due, or the putting
the dragoons on me when the country's quiet, or onything else that will
vex him,--I can bear my ain burden patiently, and warld's loss is the
least part o't."Astonished and interested at this picture of patient, grateful, and
high-minded resignation, Morton could not help bestowing an execration
upon the poor-spirited rascal who had taken such a dastardly course of
vengeance."Dinna curse him, sir," said the old woman; "I have heard a good man say
that a curse was like a stone flung up to the heavens, and maist like to
return on the head that sent it.But if ye ken Lord Evandale, bid him
look to himsell, for I hear strange words pass atween the sodgers that
are lying here, and his name is often mentioned; and the tane o' them has
been twice up at Tillietudlem.He's a kind of favourite wi' the laird,
though he was in former times ane o' the maist cruel oppressors ever rade
through a country (out-taken Sergeant Bothwell),--they ca' him Inglis.""I have the deepest interest in Lord Evandale's safety," said Morton,
"and you may depend on my finding some mode to apprise him of these
suspicious circumstances.And, in return, my good friend, will you
indulge me with another question?Do you know anything of Quintin Mackell
of Irongray?"echoed the blind woman, in a tone of great surprise and
alarm."Quintin Mackell of Irongray," repeated Morton."Is there anything so
alarming in the sound of that name?""Na, na," answered the woman, with hesitation; "but to hear him asked
after by a stranger and a sodger,--Gude protect us, what mischief is
to come next!""None by my means, I assure you," said Morton; "the subject of my inquiry
has nothing to fear from me if, as I suppose, this Quintin Mackell is the
same with John Bal-----.""Do not mention his name," said the widow, pressing his lips with her
fingers."I see you have his secret and his pass-word, and I'll be free
wi' you.But, for God's sake, speak lound and low.In the name of Heaven,
I trust ye seek him not to his hurt!"I said truly; but one he has nothing to fear from.I commanded a party
at Bothwell Bridge.""And verily there is something in your voice I
can trust.Ye speak prompt and readily, and like an honest man.""I trust I am so," said Morton."But nae displeasure to you, sir, in thae waefu' times," continued Mrs.Maclure, "the hand of brother is against brother, and he fears as mickle
almaist frae this Government as e'er he did frae the auld persecutors."said Morton, in a tone of inquiry; "I was not aware of that.But
I am only just now returned from abroad.""I'll tell ye," said the blind woman, first assuming an attitude of
listening that showed how effectually her powers of collecting
intelligence had been transferred from the eye to the ear; for, instead
of casting a glance of circumspection around, she stooped her face, and
turned her head slowly around, in such a manner as to insure that there
was not the slightest sound stirring in the neighbourhood, and then
continued,--"I'll tell ye.Ye ken how he has laboured to raise up again
the Covenant, burned, broken, and buried in the hard hearts and selfish
devices of this stubborn people.Now, when he went to Holland, far from
the countenance and thanks of the great, and the comfortable fellowship
of the godly, both whilk he was in right to expect, the Prince of Orange
wad show him no favour, and the ministers no godly communion.This was
hard to bide for ane that had suffered and done mickle,--ower mickle, it
may be; but why suld I be a judge?He came back to me and to the auld
place o' refuge that had often received him in his distresses, mair
especially before the great day of victory at Drumclog, for I sail ne'er
forget how he was bending hither of a' nights in the year on that e'ening
after the play when young Milnwood wan the popinjay; but I warned him off
for that time."exclaimed Morton, "it was you that sat in your red cloak by the
high-road, and told him there was a lion in the path?"said the old woman, breaking off her
narrative in astonishment."But be wha ye may," she continued, resuming
it with tranquillity, "ye can ken naething waur o' me than that I hae
been willing to save the life o' friend and foe.""I know no ill of you, Mrs.Maclure, and I mean no ill by you; I only
wished to show you that I know so much of this person's affairs that I
might be safely intrusted with the rest.Proceed, if you please, in your
narrative.""There is a strange command in your voice," said the blind woman, "though
its tones are sweet.The Stewarts hae been
dethroned, and William and Mary reign in their stead; but nae mair word
of the Covenant than if it were a dead letter.They hae taen the indulged
clergy, and an Erastian General Assembly of the ante pure and triumphant
Kirk of Scotland, even into their very arms and bosoms.Our faithfu'
champions o' the testimony agree e'en waur wi' this than wi' the open
tyranny and apostasy of the persecuting times, for souls are hardened and
deadened, and the mouths of fasting multitudes are crammed wi' fizenless
bran instead of the sweet word in season; and mony an hungry, starving
creature, when he sits down on a Sunday forenoon to get something that
might warm him to the great work, has a dry clatter o' morality driven
about his lugs, and--"

"In short," said Morton, desirous to stop a discussion which the good old
woman, as enthusiastically attached to her religious profession as to the
duties of humanity, might probably have indulged longer,--"In short, you
are not disposed to acquiesce in this new government, and Burley is of
the same opinion?""Many of our brethren, sir, are of belief we fought for the Covenant, and
fasted and prayed and suffered for that grand national league, and now we
are like neither to see nor hear tell of that which we suffered and
fought and fasted and prayed for.And anes it was thought something might
be made by bringing back the auld family on a new bargain and a new
bottom, as, after a', when King James went awa, I understand the great
quarrel of the English against him was in behalf of seven unhallowed
prelates; and sae, though ae part of our people were free to join wi' the
present model, and levied an armed regiment under the Yerl of Angus, yet
our honest friend, and others that stude up for purity of doctrine and
freedom of conscience, were determined to hear the breath o' the
Jacobites before they took part again them, fearing to fa' to the ground
like a wall built with unslaked mortar, or from sitting between twa
stools.""They chose an odd quarter," said Morton, "from which to expect freedom
of conscience and purity of doctrine."said the landlady, "the natural day-spring rises in the
east, but the spiritual dayspring may rise in the north, for what we
blinded mortals ken.""And Burley went to the north to seek it?""Truly ay, sir; and he saw Claver'se himsell, that they ca' Dundee now."exclaimed Morton, in amazement; "I would have sworn that meeting
would have been the last of one of their lives.""Na, na, sir; in troubled times, as I understand," said Mrs.Maclure,
"there's sudden changes,--Montgomery and Ferguson and mony ane mair that
were King James's greatest faes are on his side now.Claver'se spake our
friend fair, and sent him to consult with Lord Evandale.But then there
was a break-off, for Lord Evandale wadna look at, hear, or speak wi' him;
and now he's anes wud and aye waur, and roars for revenge again Lord
Evandale, and will hear nought of onything but burn and slay.And oh,
thae starts o' passion!they unsettle his mind, and gie the Enemy sair
advantages."Are ye acquainted familiarly wi' John Balfour o' Burley, and
dinna ken that he has had sair and frequent combats to sustain against
the Evil One?Did ye ever see him alone but the Bible was in his hand,
and the drawn sword on his knee?Did ye never sleep in the same room wi'
him, and hear him strive in his dreams with the delusions of Satan?Oh,
ye ken little o' him if ye have seen him only in fair daylight; for nae
man can put the face upon his doleful visits and strifes that he can do.I hae seen him, after sic a strife of agony, tremble that an infant might
hae held him, while the hair on his brow was drapping as fast as ever my
puir thatched roof did in a heavy rain."As she spoke, Morton began to
recollect the appearance of Burley during his sleep in the hay-loft at
Milnwood, the report of Cuddie that his senses had become impaired, and
some whispers current among the Cameronians, who boasted frequently of
Burley's soul-exercises and his strifes with the foul fiend,--which
several circumstances led him to conclude that this man himself was a
victim to those delusions, though his mind, naturally acute and forcible,
not only disguised his superstition from those in whose opinion it might
have discredited his judgment, but by exerting such a force as is said to
be proper to those afflicted with epilepsy, could postpone the fits which
it occasioned until he was either freed from superintendence, or
surrounded by such as held him more highly on account of these
visitations.It was natural to suppose, and could easily be inferred from
the narrative of Mrs.Maclure, that disappointed ambition, wrecked hopes,
and the downfall of the party which he had served with such desperate
fidelity, were likely to aggravate enthusiasm into temporary insanity.It
was, indeed, no uncommon circumstance in those singular times that men
like Sir Harry Vane, Harrison, Overton, and others, themselves slaves to
the wildest and most enthusiastic dreams, could, when mingling with the
world, conduct themselves not only with good sense in difficulties, and
courage in dangers, but with the most acute sagacity and determined
valour.Maclure's information confirmed
Morton in these impressions."In the grey of the morning," she said, "my little Peggy sail show ye the
gate to him before the sodgers are up.But ye maun let his hour of
danger, as he ca's it, be ower, afore ye venture on him in his place of
refuge.Peggy will tell ye when to venture in.She kens his ways weel,
for whiles she carries him some little helps that he canna do
without to sustain life.""And in what retreat, then," said Morton, "has this unfortunate person
found refuge?""An awsome place," answered the blind woman, "as ever living creature
took refuge in; they ca it the Black Linn of Linklater.It's a doleful
place, but he loves it abune a' others, because he has sae often been in
safe hiding there; and it's my belief he prefers it to a tapestried
chamber and a down bed.I hae seen it mysell mony a day
syne.I was a daft hempie lassie then, and little thought what was to
come o't.--Wad ye choose ony thing, sir, ere ye betake yoursell to your
rest, for ye maun stir wi' the first dawn o' the grey light?""Nothing more, my good mother," said Morton; and they parted for the
evening.Morton recommended himself to Heaven, threw himself on the bed, heard,
between sleeping and waking, the trampling of the dragoon horses at the
riders' return from their patrol, and then slept soundly after such
painful agitation.The darksome cave they enter, where they found
               The accursed man low sitting on the ground,
               Musing full sadly in his sullen mind.As the morning began to appear on the mountains, a gentle knock was heard
at the door of the humble apartment in which Morton slept, and a girlish
treble voice asked him, from without, "If he wad please gang to the Linn
or the folk raise?"He arose upon the invitation, and, dressing himself hastily, went forth
and joined his little guide.The mountain maid tript lightly before him,
through the grey haze, over hill and moor.It was a wild and varied walk,
unmarked by any regular or distinguishable track, and keeping, upon the
whole, the direction of the ascent of the brook, though without tracing
its windings.The landscape, as they advanced, became waster and more
wild, until nothing but heath and rock encumbered the side of the valley."Nearly a mile off," answered
the girl."And do you often go this wild journey, my little maid?""When grannie sends me wi' milk and meal to the Linn," answered the
child."And are you not afraid to travel so wild a road alone?""Hout na, sir," replied the guide; "nae living creature wad touch sic a
bit thing as I am, and grannie says we need never fear onything else when
we are doing a gude turn."said Morton to himself, and
followed her steps in silence.They soon came to a decayed thicket, where brambles and thorns supplied
the room of the oak and birches of which it had once consisted.Here the
guide turned short off the open heath, and, by a sheep-track, conducted
Morton to the brook.A hoarse and sullen roar had in part prepared him
for the scene which presented itself, yet it was not to be viewed without
surprise and even terror.When he emerged from the devious path which
conducted him through the thicket, he found himself placed on a ledge of
flat rock projecting over one side of a chasm not less than a hundred
feet deep, where the dark mountain-stream made a decided and rapid shoot
over the precipice, and was swallowed up by a deep, black, yawning gulf.The eye in vain strove to see the bottom of the fall; it could catch but
one sheet of foaming uproar and sheer descent, until the view was
obstructed by the proecting crags which enclosed the bottom of the
waterfall, and hid from sight the dark pool which received its tortured
waters; far beneath, at the distance of perhaps a quarter of a mile, the
eye caught the winding of the stream as it emerged into a more open
course.But, for that distance, they were lost to sight as much as if a
cavern had been arched over them; and indeed the steep and projecting
ledges of rock through which they wound their way in darkness were very
nearly closing and over-roofing their course.While Morton gazed at this scene of tumult, which seemed, by the
surrounding thickets and the clefts into which the waters descended, to
seek to hide itself from every eye, his little attendant as she stood
beside him on the platform of rock which commanded the best view of the
fall, pulled him by the sleeve, and said, in a tone which he could not
hear without stooping his ear near the speaker, "Hear till him!Morton listened more attentively; and out of the very abyss into which
the brook fell, and amidst the turnultuary sounds of the cataract,
thought he could distinguish shouts, screams, and even articulate words,
as if the tortured demon of the stream had been mingling his complaints
with the roar of his broken waters."This is the way," said the little girl; "follow me, gin ye please, sir,
but tak tent to your feet;" and, with the daring agility which custom had
rendered easy, she vanished from the platform on which she stood, and, by
notches and slight projections in the rock, scrambled down its face into
the chasm which it overhung.Steady, bold, and active, Morton hesitated
not to follow her; but the necessary attention to secure his hold and
footing in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security,
prevented him from looking around him, till, having descended nigh twenty
feet, and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall,
his guide made a pause, and he again found himself by her side in a
situation that appeared equally romantic and precarious.They were nearly
opposite to the waterfall, and in point of level situated at about
one-quarter's depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered,
and three-fourths of the height above the dark, deep, and restless pool
which received its fall.Both these tremendous points--the first shoot,
namely, of the yet unbroken stream, and the deep and sombre abyss into
which it was emptied--were full before him, as well as the whole
continuous stream of billowy froth, which, dashing from the one, was
eddying and boiling in the other.They were so near this grand phenomenon
that they were covered with its spray, and well-nigh deafened by the
incessant roar.But crossing in the very front of the fall, and at scarce
three yards distance from the cataract, an old oak-tree, flung across the
chasm in a manner that seemed accidental, formed a bridge of fearfully
narrow dimensions and uncertain footing.The upper end of the tree rested
on the platform on which they stood; the lower or uprooted extremity
extended behind a projection on the opposite side, and was secured,
Morton's eye could not discover where.From behind the same projection
glimmered a strong red light, which, glancing in the waves of the falling
water, and tinging them partially with crimson, had a strange
preternatural and sinister effect when contrasted with the beams of the
rising sun, which glanced on the first broken waves of the fall, though
even its meridian splendour could not gain the third of its full depth.When he had looked around him for a moment, the girl again pulled his
sleeve, and, pointing to the oak and the projecting point beyond it (for
hearing speech was now out of the question), indicated that there lay his
farther passage.Morton gazed at her with surprise; for although he well knew that the
persecuted Presbyterians had in the preceding reigns sought refuge among
dells and thickets, caves and cataracts, in spots the most extraordinary
and secluded; although he had heard of the champions of the Covenant, who
had long abidden beside Dobs-lien on the wild heights of Polmoodie, and
others who had been concealed in the yet more terrific cavern called
Creehope-linn, in the parish of Closeburn,--yet his imagination had never
exactly figured out the horrors of such a residence, and he was surprised
how the strange and romantic scene which he now saw had remained
concealed from him, while a curious investigator of such natural
phenomena.But he readily conceived that, lying in a remote and wild
district, and being destined as a place of concealment to the persecuted
preachers and professors of nonconformity, the secret of its existence
was carefully preserved by the few shepherds to whom it might be known.As, breaking from these meditations, he began to consider how he should
traverse the doubtful and terrific bridge, which, skirted by the cascade,
and rendered wet and slippery by its constant drizzle, traversed the
chasm above sixty feet from the bottom of the fall, his guide, as if to
give him courage, tript over and back without the least hesitation.Envying for a moment the little bare feet which caught a safer hold of
the rugged side of the oak than he could pretend to with his heavy boots,
Morton nevertheless resolved to attempt the passage, and, fixing his eye
firm on a stationary object on the other side, without allowing his head
to become giddy, or his attention to be distracted by the flash, the
foam, and the roar of the waters around him, he strode steadily and
safely along the uncertain bridge, and reached the mouth of a small
cavern on the farther side of the torrent.Here he paused; for a light,
proceeding from a fire of red-hot charcoal, permitted him to see the
interior of the cave, and enabled him to contemplate the appearance of
its inhabitant, by whom he himself could not be so readily distinguished,
being concealed by the shadow of the rock.What he observed would by no
means have encouraged a less determined man to proceed with the task
which he had undertaken.Burley, only altered from what he had been formerly by the addition of a
grisly beard, stood in the midst of the cave, with his clasped Bible in
one hand, and his drawn sword in the other.His figure, dimly ruddied by
the light of the red charcoal, seemed that of a fiend in the lurid
atmosphere of Pandemonium, and his gestures and words, as far as they
could be heard, seemed equally violent and irregular.All alone, and in a
place of almost unapproachable seclusion, his demeanour was that of
a man who strives for life and death with a mortal enemy.he exclaimed, accompanying each word with a thrust,
urged with his whole force against the impassible and empty air, "Did I
not tell thee so?--I have resisted, and thou fleest from me!--Coward as
thou art, come in all thy terrors; come with mine own evil deeds, which
render thee most terrible of all,--there is enough betwixt the boards of
this book to rescue me!--What mutterest thou of grey hairs?It was well
done to slay him,--the more ripe the corn, the readier for the sickle.--
Art gone?Art gone?--I have ever known thee but a coward--ha!With these wild exclamations he sunk the point of his sword, and remained
standing still in the same posture, like a maniac whose fit is over."The dangerous time is by now," said the little girl who had followed;
"it seldom lasts beyond the time that the sun's ower the hill; ye may
gang in and speak wi' him now.I'll wait for you at the other side of the
linn; he canna bide to see twa folk at anes."Slowly and cautiously, and keeping constantly upon his guard, Morton
presented himself to the view of his old associate in command.comest thou again when thine hour is over?"was his first
exclamation; and flourishing his sword aloft, his countenance assumed an
expression in which ghastly terror seemed mingled with the rage of a
demoniac.Balfour," said Morton, in a steady and composed tone,
"to renew an acquaintance which has been broken off since the fight of
Bothwell Bridge."As soon as Burley became aware that Morton was before him in person,--an
idea which he caught with marvellous celerity,--he at once exerted that
mastership over his heated and enthusiastic imagination, the power of
enforcing which was a most striking part of his extraordinary character.He sunk his sword-point at once, and as he stole it composedly into the
scabbard, he muttered something of the damp and cold which sent an old
soldier to his fencing exercise, to prevent his blood from chilling.This
done, he proceeded in the cold, determined manner which was peculiar to
his ordinary discourse:--

"Thou hast tarried long, Henry Morton, and hast not come to the vintage
before the twelfth hour has struck.Art thou yet willing to take the
right hand of fellowship, and be one with those who look not to thrones
or dynasties, but to the rule of Scripture, for their directions?"[Illustration: Morton and Black Linn--272]


"I am surprised," said Morton, evading the direct answer to his question,
"that you should have known me after so many years.""The features of those who ought to act with me are engraved on my
heart," answered Burley; "and few but Silas Morton's son durst have
followed me into this my castle of retreat.Seest thou that drawbridge of
Nature's own construction?"he added, pointing to the prostrate
oak-tree,--"one spurn of my foot, and it is overwhelmed in the abyss
below, bidding foeman on the farther side stand at defiance, and leaving
enemies on this at the mercy of one who never yet met his equal in single
fight.""Of such defences," said Morton, "I should have thought you would now
have had little need.""What little need, when incarnate
fiends are combined against me on earth, and Sathan himself--But it
matters not," added he, checking himself."Enough that I like my place
of refuge, my cave of Adullam, and would not change its rude ribs of
limestone rock for the fair chambers of the castle of the earls of
Torwood, with their broad bounds and barony.Thou, unless the foolish
fever-fit be over, mayst think differently.""It was of those very possessions I came to speak," said Morton; "and I
doubt not to find Mr.Balfour the same rational and reflecting person
which I knew him to be in times when zeal disunited brethren.""In a word, then," said Morton, "you have exercised, by means at which I
can guess, a secret, but most prejudicial, influence over the fortunes of
Lady Margaret Bellenden and her granddaughter, and in favour of that
base, oppressive apostate, Basil Olifant, whom the law, deceived by thy
operations, has placed in possession of their lawful property.""I do say so," replied Morton; "and face to face you will not deny what
you have vouched by your handwriting.""And suppose I deny it not," said Balfour; "and suppose that
thy--eloquence were found equal to persuade me to retrace the steps I
have taken on matured resolve,--what will be thy meed?Dost thou still
hope to possess the fair-haired girl, with her wide and rich
inheritance?""I have no such hope," answered Morton, calmly."And for whom, then, hast thou ventured to do this great thing,--to seek
to rend the prey from the valiant, to bring forth food from the den of
the lion, and to extract sweetness from the maw of the devourer?For
whose sake hast thou undertaken to read this riddle, more hard than
Samson's?""For Lord Evandale's and that of his bride," replied Morton, firmly.Balfour, and believe there are some who are
willing to sacrifice their happiness to that of others.""Then, as my soul liveth," replied Balfour, "thou art, to wear beard and
back a horse and draw a sword, the tamest and most gall-less puppet that
ever sustained injury unavenged.thou wouldst help that accursed
Evandale to the arms of the woman that thou lovest; thou wouldst endow
them with wealth and with heritages, and thou think'st that there lives
another man, offended even more deeply than thou, yet equally
cold-livered and mean-spirited, crawling upon the face of the earth,
and hast dared to suppose that one other to be John Balfour?""For my own feelings," said Morton, composedly, "I am answerable to none
but Heaven; to you, Mr.Balfour, I should suppose it of little
consequence whether Basil Olifant or Lord Evandale possess these
estates.""Thou art deceived," said Burley; "both are indeed in outer darkness,
and strangers to the light, as he whose eyes have never been opened to
the day.But this Basil Olifant is a Nabal, a Demas, a base churl whose
wealth and power are at the disposal of him who can threaten to deprive
him of them.He became a professor because he was deprived of these lands
of Tillietudlem; he turned a <DW7> to obtain possession of them; he
called himself an Erastian, that he might not again lose them; and he
will become what I list while I have in my power the document that may
deprive him of them.These lands are a bit between his jaws and a hook in
his nostrils, and the rein and the line are in my hands to guide them as
I think meet; and his they shall therefore be, unless I had assurance of
bestowing them on a sure and sincere friend.But Lord Evandale is a
malignant, of heart like flint, and brow like adamant; the goods of the
world fall on him like leaves on the frost-bound earth, and unmoved he
will see them whirled off by the first wind.The heathen virtues of such
as he are more dangerous to us than the sordid cupidity of those who,
governed by their interest, must follow where it leads, and who,
therefore, themselves the slaves of avarice, may be compelled to work
in the vineyard, were it but to earn the wages of sin.""This might have been all well some years since," replied Morton, "and I
could understand your argument, although I could never acquiesce in its
justice.But at this crisis it seems useless to you to persevere in
keeping up an influence which can no longer be directed to an useful
purpose.The land has peace, liberty, and freedom of conscience,--and
what would you more?"exclaimed Burley, again unsheathing his sword, with a vivacity
which nearly made Morton start."Look at the notches upon that weapon
they are three in number, are they not?""It seems so," answered Morton; "but what of that?""The fragment of steel that parted from this first gap rested on the
skull of the perjured traitor who first introduced Episcopacy into
Scotland; this second notch was made in the rib-bone of an impious
villain, the boldest and best soldier that upheld the prelatic cause at
Drumclog; this third was broken on the steel head-piece of the captain
who defended the Chapel of Holyrood when the people rose at the
Revolution.I cleft him to the teeth, through steel and bone.It has done
great deeds, this little weapon, and each of these blows was a
deliverance to the Church.This sword," he said, again sheathing it,
"has yet more to do,--to weed out this base and pestilential heresy of
Erastianism; to vindicate the true liberty of the Kirk in her purity;
to restore the Covenant in its glory,--then let it moulder and rust
beside the bones of its master.""You have neither men nor means, Mr.Balfour, to disturb the Government
as now settled," argued Morton; "the people are in general satisfied,
excepting only the gentlemen of the Jacobite interest; and surely you
would not join with those who would only use you for their own purposes?""It is they," answered Burley, "that should serve ours.I went to the
camp of the malignant Claver'se, as the future King of Israel sought the
land of the Philistines; I arranged with him a rising; and but for the
villain Evandale, the Erastians ere now had been driven from the West.--
I could slay him," he added, with a vindictive scowl, "were he grasping
the horns of the altar!"He then proceeded in a calmer tone: "If thou,
son of mine ancient comrade, were suitor for thyself to this Edith
Bellenden, and wert willing to put thy hand to the great work with zeal
equal to thy courage, think not I would prefer the friendship of Basil
Olifant to thine; thou shouldst then have the means that this document
[he produced a parchment] affords to place her in possession of the lands
of her fathers.This have I longed to say to thee ever since I saw thee
fight the good fight so strongly at the fatal Bridge.The maiden loved
thee, and thou her."Morton replied firmly, "I will not dissemble with you, Mr.Balfour, even
to gain a good end.I came in hopes to persuade you to do a deed of
justice to others, not to gain any selfish end of my own.I have failed;
I grieve for your sake more than for the loss which others will sustain
by your injustice.""Would you be really, as you are desirous to be
thought, a man of honour and conscience, you would, regardless of all
other considerations, restore that parchment to Lord Evandale, to be used
for the advantage of the lawful heir."said Balfour; and, casting the deed into the
heap of red charcoal beside him, pressed it down with the heel of his
boot.While it smoked, shrivelled, and crackled in the flames, Morton sprung
forward to snatch it, and Burley catching hold of him, a struggle ensued.Both were strong men; but although Morton was much the more active and
younger of the two, yet Balfour was the most powerful, and effectually
prevented him from rescuing the deed until it was fairly reduced to a
cinder.They then quitted hold of each other, and the enthusiast,
rendered fiercer by the contest, glared on Morton with an eye expressive
of frantic revenge."Thou hast my secret," he exclaimed; "thou must be mine, or die!""I contemn your threats," said Morton; "I pity you, and leave you."But as he turned to retire, Burley stept before him, pushed the oak-trunk
from its resting place, and as it fell thundering and crashing into the
abyss beneath, drew his sword, and cried out, with a voice that rivalled
the roar of the cataract and the thunder of the falling oak, "Now thou
art at bay!and standing in the mouth of the
cavern, he flourished his naked sword."I will not fight with the man that preserved my father's life," said
Morton."I have not yet learned to say the words, 'I yield;' and my life
I will rescue as I best can."So speaking, and ere Balfour was aware of his purpose, he sprung past
him, and exerting that youthful agility of which he possessed an uncommon
share, leaped clear across the fearful chasm which divided the mouth of
the cave from the projecting rock on the opposite side, and stood there
safe and free from his incensed enemy.He immediately ascended the
ravine, and, as he turned, saw Burley stand for an instant aghast with
astonishment, and then, with the frenzy of disappointed rage, rush into
the interior of his cavern.It was not difficult for him to perceive that this unhappy man's mind had
been so long agitated by desperate schemes and sudden disappointments
that it had lost its equipoise, and that there was now in his conduct a
shade of lunacy, not the less striking, from the vigour and craft with
which he pursued his wild designs.Morton soon joined his guide, who had
been terrified by the fall of the oak.This he represented as accidental;
and she assured him, in return, that the inhabitant of the cave would
experience no inconvenience from it, being always provided with materials
to construct another bridge.The adventures of the morning were not yet ended.As they approached the
hut, the little girl made an exclamation of surprise at seeing her
grandmother groping her way towards them, at a greater distance from her
home than she could have been supposed capable of travelling.said the old woman, when she heard them approach, "gin
e'er ye loved Lord Evandale, help now, or never!God be praised that left
my hearing when he took my poor eyesight!Peggy, hinny, gang saddle the gentleman's horse, and
lead him cannily ahint the thorny shaw, and bide him there."She conducted him to a small window, through which, himself unobserved,
he could see two dragoons seated at their morning draught of ale, and
conversing earnestly together."The more I think of it," said the one, "the less I like it, Inglis;
Evandale was a good officer and the soldier's friend; and though we were
punished for the mutiny at Tillietudlem, yet, by ---, Frank, you must own
we deserved it.""D--n seize me if I forgive him for it, though!"replied the other; "and
I think I can sit in his skirts now.""Why, man, you should forget and forgive.Better take the start with him
along with the rest, and join the ranting Highlanders.We have all eat
King James's bread.""Thou art an ass; the start, as you call it, will never happen,--the
day's put off.Halliday's seen a ghost, or Miss Bellenden's fallen sick
of the pip, or some blasted nonsense or another; the thing will never
keep two days longer, and the first bird that sings out will get the
reward.""That's true too," answered his comrade; "and will this fellow--this
Basil Olifant--pay handsomely?""Like a prince, man," said Inglis."Evandale is the man on earth whom he
hates worst, and he fears him, besides, about some law business; and were
he once rubbed out of the way, all, he thinks, will be his own.""But shall we have warrants and force enough?""Few people here will stir against my lord, and we may find him with some
of our own fellows at his back.""Thou 'rt a cowardly fool, Dick," returned Inglis; "he is living quietly
down at Fairy Knowe to avoid suspicion.Olifant is a magistrate, and will
have some of his own people that he can trust along with him.There are
us two, and the laird says he can get a desperate fighting Whig fellow,
called Quintin Mackell, that has an old grudge at Evandale.""Well, well, you are my officer, you know," said the private, with true
military conscience, "and if anything is wrong--"

"I'll take the blame," said Inglis."Come, another pot of ale, and let us
to Tillietudlem.--Here, blind Bess!--Why, where the devil has the old hag
crept to?""Delay them as long as you can," whispered Morton, as he thrust his purse
into the hostess's hand; "all depends on gaining time."Then, walking swiftly to the place where the girl held his horse ready,
"To Fairy Knowe?Wittenbold, the commandant there, will readily give me the
support of a troop, and procure me the countenance of the civil power.I
must drop a caution as I pass.--Come, Moorkopf," he said, addressing his
horse as he mounted him, "this day must try your breath and speed."Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw,
          Though less and less of Emily he saw;
          So, speechless for a little space he lay,
          Then grasp'd the hand he held, and sigh'd his soul away.The indisposition of Edith confined her to bed during the eventful day on
which she had received such an unexpected shock from the sudden
apparition of Morton.Next morning, however, she was reported to be so
much better that Lord Evandale resumed his purpose of leaving Fairy
Knowe.At a late hour in the forenoon Lady Emily entered the apartment of
Edith with a peculiar gravity of manner.Having received and paid the
compliments of the day, she observed it would be a sad one for her,
though it would relieve Miss Bellenden of an encumbrance: "My brother
leaves us today, Miss Bellenden."exclaimed Edith, in surprise; "for his own house, I trust?""I have reason to think he meditates a more distant journey," answered
Lady Emily; "he has little to detain him in this country."exclaimed Edith, "why was I born to become the wreck of
all that is manly and noble!What can be done to stop him from running
headlong on ruin?I will come down instantly.--Say that I implore he will
not depart until I speak with him.""It will be in vain, Miss Bellenden; but I will execute your commission;"
and she left the room as formally as she had entered it, and informed her
brother Miss Bellenden was so much recovered as to propose coming
downstairs ere he went away."I suppose," she added pettishly, "the prospect of being speedily
released from our company has wrought a cure on her shattered nerves.""Sister," said Lord Evandale, "you are unjust, if not envious.""Unjust I maybe, Evandale, but I should not have dreamt," glancing her
eye at a mirror, "of being thought envious without better cause.But let
us go to the old lady; she is making a feast in the other room which
might have dined all your troop when you had one."Lord Evandale accompanied her in silence to the parlour, for he knew it
was in vain to contend with her prepossessions and offended pride.They
found the table covered with refreshments, arranged under the careful
inspection of Lady Margaret."Ye could hardly weel be said to breakfast this morning, my Lord
Evandale, and ye maun e'en partake of a small collation before ye ride,
such as this poor house, whose inmates are so much indebted to you, can
provide in their present circumstances.For my ain part, I like to see
young folk take some refection before they ride out upon their sports or
their affairs, and I said as much to his most sacred Majesty when he
breakfasted at Tillietudlem in the year of grace sixteen hundred and
fifty-one; and his most sacred Majesty was pleased to reply, drinking to
my health at the same time in a flagon of Rhenish wine, 'Lady Margaret,
ye speak like a Highland oracle.'These were his Majesty's very words;
so that your lordship may judge whether I have not good authority to
press young folk to partake of their vivers."It may be well supposed that much of the good lady's speech failed Lord
Evandale's ears, which were then employed in listening for the light step
of Edith.His absence of mind on this occasion, however natural, cost him
very dear.While Lady Margaret was playing the kind hostess,--a part she
delighted and excelled in,--she was interrupted by John Gudyill, who, in
the natural phrase for announcing an inferior to the mistress of a
family, said, "There was ane wanting to speak to her leddyship."Ye speak as if I kept a shop, and was to
come at everybody's whistle.""Yes, he has a name," answered John, "but your leddyship likes ill to
hear't.""It's Calf-Gibbie, my leddy," said John, in a tone rather above the pitch
of decorous respect, on which he occasionally trespassed, confiding in
his merit as an ancient servant of the family and a faithful follower of
their humble fortunes,--"It's Calf-Gibbie, an your leddyship will hae't,
that keeps Edie Henshaw's kye down yonder at the Brigg-end,--that's him
that was Guse-Gibbie at Tillietudlem, and gaed to the wappinshaw, and
that--"

"Hold your peace, John," said the old lady, rising in dignity; "you are
very insolent to think I wad speak wi' a person like that.Let him tell
his business to you or Mrs."He'll no hear o' that, my leddy; he says them that sent him bade him gie
the thing to your leddyship's ain hand direct, or to Lord Evandale's, he
wots na whilk.But, to say the truth, he's far frae fresh, and he's but
an idiot an he were.""Then turn him out," said Lady Margaret, "and tell him to come back
to-morrow when he is sober.I suppose he comes to crave some benevolence,
as an ancient follower o' the house.""Like eneugh, my leddy, for he's a' in rags, poor creature."Gudyill made another attempt to get at Gibbie's commission, which was
indeed of the last importance, being a few lines from Morton to Lord
Evandale, acquainting him with the danger in which he stood from the
practices of Olifant, and exhorting him either to instant flight, or else
to come to Glasgow and surrender himself, where he could assure him of
protection.This billet, hastily written, he intrusted to Gibbie, whom he
saw feeding his herd beside the bridge, and backed with a couple of
dollars his desire that it might instantly be delivered into the hand to
which it was addressed.But it was decreed that Goose-Gibbie's intermediation, whether as an
emissary or as a man-at-arms, should be unfortunate to the family of
Tillietudlem.He unluckily tarried so long at the ale-house to prove if
his employer's coin was good that, when he appeared at Fairy Knowe, the
little sense which nature had given him was effectually drowned in ale
and brandy; and instead of asking for Lord Evandale, he demanded to speak
with Lady Margaret, whose name was more familiar to his ear.Being
refused admittance to her presence, he staggered away with the letter
undelivered, perversely faithful to Morton's instructions in the only
point in which it would have been well had he departed from them.A few minutes after he was gone, Edith entered the apartment.Lord
Evandale and she met with mutual embarrassment, which Lady Margaret, who
only knew in general that their union had been postponed by her
granddaughter's indisposition, set down to the bashfulness of a bride and
bridegroom, and, to place them at ease, began to talk to Lady Emily on
indifferent topics.At this moment Edith, with a countenance as pale as
death, muttered, rather than whispered, to Lord Evandale a request to
speak with him.He offered his arm, and supported her into the small
ante-room, which, as we have noticed before, opened from the parlour.He
placed her in a chair, and, taking one himself, awaited the opening of
the conversation."I am distressed, my lord," were the first words she was able to
articulate, and those with difficulty; "I scarce know what I would say,
nor how to speak it.""If I have any share in occasioning your uneasiness," said Lord Evandale,
mildly, "you will soon, Edith, be released from it.""You are determined then, my lord," she replied, "to run this desperate
course with desperate men, in spite of your own better reason, in spite
of your friends' entreaties, in spite of the almost inevitable ruin which
yawns before you?""Forgive me, Miss Bellenden; even your solicitude on my account must not
detain me when my honour calls.My horses stand ready saddled, my
servants are prepared, the signal for rising will be given so soon as I
reach Kilsyth.If it is my fate that calls me, I will not shun meeting
it.It will be something," he said, taking her hand, "to die deserving
your compassion, since I cannot gain your love."said Edith, in a tone which went to his heart;
"time may explain the strange circumstance which has shocked me so much;
my agitated nerves may recover their tranquillity.Oh, do not rush on
death and ruin!remain to be our prop and stay, and hope everything from
time!""It is too late, Edith," answered Lord Evandale; "and I were most
ungenerous could I practise on the warmth and kindliness of your feelings
towards me.I know you cannot love me; nervous distress, so strong as to
conjure up the appearance of the dead or absent, indicates a predilection
too powerful to give way to friendship and gratitude alone.But were it
otherwise, the die is now cast."As he spoke thus, Cuddie burst into the room, terror and haste in his
countenance."Oh, my lord, hide yoursell!they hae beset the outlets o'
the house," was his first exclamation."A party of horse, headed by Basil Olifant," answered Cuddie.echoed Edith, in an agony of terror."What right has the
villain to assail me or stop my passage?I will make my way, were he
backed by a regiment; tell Halliday and Hunter to get out the horses.--
And now, farewell, Edith!"He clasped her in his arms, and kissed her
tenderly; then, bursting from his sister, who, with Lady Margaret,
endeavoured to detain him, rushed out and mounted his horse.All was in confusion; the women shrieked and hurried in consternation to
the front windows of the house, from which they could see a small party
of horsemen, of whom two only seemed soldiers.They were on the open
ground before Cuddie's cottage, at the bottom of the descent from the
house, and showed caution in approaching it, as if uncertain of the
strength within.said Edith; "oh, would he but take the
by-road!"But Lord Evandale, determined to face a danger which his high spirit
undervalued, commanded his servants to follow him, and rode composedly
down the avenue.Old Gudyill ran to arm himself, and Cuddie snatched down
a gun which was kept for the protection of the house, and, although on
foot, followed Lord Evandale.It was in vain his wife, who had hurried up
on the alarm, hung by his skirts, threatening him with death by the sword
or halter for meddling with other folk's matters."Hand your peace, ye b----," said Cuddie; "and that's braid Scotch, or I
wotna what is.Is it ither folk's matters to see Lord Evandale murdered
before my face?"But considering on the
way that he composed the whole infantry, as John Gudyill had not
appeared, he took his vantage ground behind the hedge, hammered his
flint, cocked his piece, and, taking a long aim at Laird Basil, as he was
called, stood prompt for action.As soon as Lord Evandale appeared, Olifant's party spread themselves a
little, as if preparing to enclose him.Their leader stood fast,
supported by three men, two of whom were dragoons, the third in dress and
appearance a countryman, all well armed.But the strong figure, stern
features, and resolved manner of the third attendant made him seem the
most formidable of the party; and whoever had before seen him could have
no difficulty in recognising Balfour of Burley."Follow me," said Lord Evandale to his servants, "and if we are forcibly
opposed, do as I do."He advanced at a hand gallop towards Olifant, and
was in the act of demanding why he had thus beset the road, when Olifant
called out, "Shoot the traitor!"and the whole four fired their carabines
upon the unfortunate nobleman.He reeled in the saddle, advanced his
hand to the holster, and drew a pistol, but, unable to discharge it, fell
from his horse mortally wounded.His servants had presented their
carabines.Hunter fired at random; but Halliday, who was an intrepid
fellow, took aim at Inglis, and shot him dead on the spot.At the same
instant a shot from behind the hedge still more effectually avenged Lord
Evandale, for the ball took place in the very midst of Basil Olifant's
forehead, and stretched him lifeless on the ground.His followers,
astonished at the execution done in so short a time, seemed rather
disposed to stand inactive, when Burley, whose blood was up with the
contest, exclaimed, "Down with the Midianites!"At this instant the clatter of horses' hoofs was heard,
and a party of horse, rapidly advancing on the road from Glasgow,
appeared on the fatal field.They were foreign dragoons, led by the Dutch
commandant Wittenbold, accompanied by Morton and a civil magistrate.A hasty call to surrender, in the name of God and King William, was
obeyed by all except Burley, who turned his horse and attempted to
escape.Several soldiers pursued him by command of their officer, but,
being well mounted, only the two headmost seemed likely to gain on him.He turned deliberately twice, and discharging first one of his pistols,
and then the other, rid himself of the one pursuer by mortally wounding
him, and of the other by shooting his horse, and then continued his
flight to Bothwell Bridge, where, for his misfortune, he found the gates
shut and guarded.Turning from thence, he made for a place where the
river seemed passable, and plunged into the stream, the bullets from the
pistols and carabines of his pursuers whizzing around him.Two balls took
effect when he was past the middle of the stream, and he felt himself
dangerously wounded.He reined his horse round in the midst of the river,
and returned towards the bank he had left, waving his hand, as if with
the purpose of intimating that he surrendered.The troopers ceased firing
at him accordingly, and awaited his return, two of them riding a little
way into the river to seize and disarm him.But it presently appeared
that his purpose was revenge, not safety.As he approached the two
soldiers, he collected his remaining strength, and discharged a blow on
the head of one, which tumbled him from his horse.The other dragoon, a
strong, muscular man, had in the mean while laid hands on him.Burley, in
requital, grasped his throat, as a dying tiger seizes his prey, and both,
losing the saddle in the struggle, came headlong into the river, and were
swept down the stream.Their course might be traced by the blood which
bubbled up to the surface.They were twice seen to rise, the Dutchman
striving to swim, and Burley clinging to him in a manner that showed his
desire that both should perish.Their corpses were taken out about a
quarter of a mile down the river.As Balfour's grasp could not have been
unclenched without cutting off his hands, both were thrown into a hasty
grave, still marked by a rude stone and a ruder epitaph.[Gentle reader, I did request of mine honest friend Peter Proudfoot,
     travelling merchant, known to many of this land for his faithful and
     just dealings, as well in muslins and cambrics as in small wares, to
     procure me on his next peregrinations to that vicinage, a copy of
     the Epitaphion alluded to.And, according to his report, which I see
     no ground to discredit, it runneth thus:--

               Here lyes ane saint to prelates surly,
               Being John Balfour, sometime of Burley,
               Who stirred up to vengeance take,
               For Solemn League and Cov'nant's sake,
               Upon the Magus-Moor in Fife,
               Did tak James Sharpe the apostate's life;
               By Dutchman's hands was hacked and shot,
               Then drowned in Clyde near this saam spot.]While the soul of this stern enthusiast flitted to its account, that of
the brave and generous Lord Evandale was also released.Morton had flung
himself from his horse upon perceiving his situation, to render his dying
friend all the aid in his power.He knew him, for he pressed his hand,
and, being unable to speak, intimated by signs his wish to be conveyed to
the house.This was done with all the care possible, and he was soon
surrounded by his lamenting friends.But the clamorous grief of Lady
Emily was far exceeded in intensity by the silent agony of Edith.Unconscious even of the presence of Morton, she hung over the dying man;
nor was she aware that Fate, who was removing one faithful lover, had
restored another as if from the grave, until Lord Evandale, taking their
hands in his, pressed them both affectionately, united them together,
raised his face as if to pray for a blessing on them, and sunk back and
expired in the next moment.I had determined to waive the task of a concluding chapter, leaving to
the reader's imagination the arrangements which must necessarily take
place after Lord Evandale's death.But as I was aware that precedents are
wanting for a practice which might be found convenient both to readers
and compilers, I confess myself to have been in a considerable dilemma,
when fortunately I was honoured with an invitation to drink tea with Miss
Martha Buskbody, a young lady who has carried on the profession of
mantua-making at Ganderscleugh and in the neighbourhood, with great
success, for about forty years.Knowing her taste for narratives of this
description, I requested her to look over the loose sheets the morning
before I waited on her, and enlighten me by the experience which she must
have acquired in reading through the whole stock of three circulating
libraries, in Ganderscleugh and the two next market-towns.When, with a
palpitating heart, I appeared before her in the evening, I found her much
disposed to be complimentary."I have not been more affected," said she, wiping the glasses of her
spectacles, "by any novel, excepting the 'Tale of Jemmy and Jenny
Jessamy', which is indeed pathos itself; but your plan of omitting a
formal conclusion will never do.You may be as harrowing to our nerves as
you will in the course of your story, but, unless you had the genius
of the author of 'Julia de Roubignd,' never let the end be altogether
overclouded.Let us see a glimpse of sunshine in the last chapter; it is
quite essential.""Nothing would be more easy for me, madam, than to comply with your
injunctions; for, in truth, the parties in whom you have had the goodness
to be interested, did live long and happily, and begot sons and
daughters.""It is unnecessary, sir," she said, with a slight nod of reprimand, "to
be particular concerning their matrimonial comforts.But what is your
objection to let us have, in a general way, a glimpse of their future
felicity?""Really, madam," said I, "you must be aware that every volume of a
narrative turns less and less interesting as the author draws to a
conclusion,--just like your tea, which, though excellent hyson, is
necessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup.Now, as I think the
one is by no means improved by the luscious lump of half-dissolved sugar
usually found at the bottom of it, so I am of opinion that a history,
growing already vapid, is but dully crutched up by a detail of
circumstances which every reader must have anticipated, even though the
author exhaust on them every flowery epithet in the language."Pattieson," continued the lady; "you have, as I
may say, basted up your first story very hastily and clumsily at the
conclusion; and, in my trade, I would have cuffed the youngest apprentice
who had put such a horrid and bungled spot of work out of her hand.And
if you do not redeem this gross error by telling us all about the
marriage of Morton and Edith, and what became of the other personages of
the story, from Lady Margaret down to Goose-Gibbie, I apprise you that
you will not be held to have accomplished your task handsomely.""Well, madam," I replied, "my materials are so ample that I think I can
satisfy your curiosity, unless it descend to very minute circumstances
indeed.""First, then," said she, "for that is most essential,--Did Lady Margaret
get back her fortune and her castle?""She did, madam, and in the easiest way imaginable, as heir, namely, to
her worthy cousin, Basil Olifant, who died without a will; and thus, by
his death, not only restored, but even augmented, the fortune of her,
whom, during his life, he had pursued with the most inveterate malice.John Gudyill, reinstated in his dignity, was more important than ever;
and Cuddie, with rapturous delight, entered upon the cultivation of the
mains of Tillietudlem, and the occupation of his original cottage.But,
with the shrewd caution of his character, he was never heard to boast of
having fired the lucky shot which repossessed his lady and himself in
their original habitations.'After a',' he said to Jenny, who was his
only confidant, 'auld Basil Olifant was my leddy's cousin and a grand
gentleman; and though he was acting again the law, as I understand, for
he ne'er showed ony warrant, or required Lord Evandale to surrender, and
though I mind killing him nae mair than I wad do a muircock, yet it's
just as weel to keep a calm sough about it.'He not only did so, but
ingeniously enough countenanced a report that old Gudyill had done the
deed,--which was worth many a gill of brandy to him from the old butler,
who, far different in disposition from Cuddie, was much more inclined to
exaggerate than suppress his exploits of manhood.The blind widow was
provided for in the most comfortable manner, as well as the little guide
to the Linn; and--"

"But what is all this to the marriage,--the marriage of the principal
personages?"interrupted Miss Buskbody, impatiently tapping her
snuff-box."The marriage of Morton and Miss Bellenden was delayed for several
months, as both went into deep mourning on account of Lord Evandale's
death."I hope not without Lady Margaret's consent, sir?""I love books which teach a proper deference in young persons to their
parents.In a novel the young people may fall in love without their
countenance, because it is essential to the necessary intricacy of the
story; but they must always have the benefit of their consent at last.Even old Delville received Cecilia, though the daughter of a man of low
birth.""And even so, madam," replied I, "Lady Margaret was prevailed on to
countenance Morton, although the old Covenanter, his father, stuck sorely
with her for some time.Edith was her only hope, and she wished to see
her happy; Morton, or Melville Morton, as he was more generally called,
stood so high in the reputation of the world, and was in every other
respect such an eligible match, that she put her prejudice aside, and
consoled herself with the recollection that marriage went by destiny, as
was observed to her, she said, by his most sacred Majesty, Charles the
Second of happy memory, when she showed him the portrait of her
grand-father Fergus, third Earl of Torwood, the handsomest man of his
time, and that of Countess Jane, his second lady, who had a hump-back
and only one eye.This was his Majesty's observation, she said, on one
remarkable morning when he deigned to take his _disjune_--"

"Nay," said Miss Buskbody, again interrupting me, "if she brought such
authority to countenance her acquiescing in a misalliance, there was no
more to be said.--And what became of old Mrs.What's her name, the
housekeeper?""She was perhaps the happiest of the
party; for once a year, and not oftener, Mr.Melville Morton
dined in the great wainscotted chamber in solemn state, the hangings
being all displayed, the carpet laid down, and the huge brass candlestick
set on the table, stuck round with leaves of laurel.The preparing the
room for this yearly festival employed her mind for six months before it
came about, and the putting matters to rights occupied old Alison the
other six, so that a single day of rejoicing found her business for all
the year round.""Lived to a good old age, drank ale and brandy with guests of all
persuasions, played Whig or Jacobite tunes as best pleased his customers,
and died worth as much money as married Jenny to a cock laird.I hope,
ma'am, you have no other inquiries to make, for really--"

"Goose-Gibbie, sir?"said my persevering friend,--"Goose-Gibbie, whose
ministry was fraught with such consequences to the personages of the
narrative?""Consider, my dear Miss Buskbody, (I beg pardon for the
familiarity),--but pray consider, even the memory of the renowned
Scheherazade, that Empress of Tale-tellers, could not preserve every
circumstance.I am not quite positive as to the fate of Goose-Gibbie,
but am inclined to think him the same with one Gilbert Dudden, alias
Calf-Gibbie, who was whipped through Hamilton for stealing poultry."Miss Buskbody now placed her left foot on the fender, crossed her right
leg over her knee, lay back on the chair, and looked towards the ceiling.When I observed her assume this contemplative mood, I concluded she was
studying some farther cross-examination, and therefore took my hat and
wished her a hasty good-night, ere the Demon of Criticism had supplied
her with any more queries.In like manner, gentle Reader, returning you
my thanks for the patience which has conducted you thus far, I take the
liberty to withdraw myself from you for the present.It was mine earnest wish, most courteous Reader, that the "Tales of my
Landlord" should have reached thine hands in one entire succession of
tomes, or volumes.But as I sent some few more manuscript quires,
containing the continuation of these most pleasing narratives, I was
apprised, somewhat unceremoniously, by my publisher that he did not
approve of novels (as he injuriously called these real histories)
extending beyond four volumes, and if I did not agree to the first four
being published separately, he threatened to decline the article.as if the vernacular article of our mother English were
capable of declension.)Whereupon, somewhat moved by his remonstrances,
and more by heavy charges for print and paper, which he stated to have
been already incurred, I have resolved that these four volumes shall be
the heralds or avant-couriers of the Tales which are yet in my
possession, nothing doubting that they will be eagerly devoured, and the
remainder anxiously demanded, by the unanimous voice of a discerning
public.I rest, esteemed Reader, thine as thou shalt construe me,

                        THE FLYING MACHINE BOYS
                             IN THE WILDS.CHAPTER I.

                           UNDER THE EQUATOR.The Flying Machine Boys were camping under the equator.The _Louise_ and
the _Bertha_, the splendid aeroplanes in which the lads had visited
California and Mexico, lay on a great plateau some fifteen thousand feet
above the level of the Pacific ocean, and two thin tents of light
oiled-silk stood not far away.Ben Whitcomb and Jimmie Stuart sat at the entrance of one of the tents
shivering with cold, while Glenn Richards and Carl Nichols, in the
interest of increased warmth, chased each other around a miserable
little apology for a fire which alternately blazed and smoldered near
the aeroplanes.“I begin to understand now how those who freeze to death must suffer!”
declared Ben, his teeth chattering like the “bones” of an end-man in a
minstrel show.“You give me a pain!” grinned Jimmie.“Here we are almost exactly under
the equator, and yet you talk of being cold!”

The boy’s lips were blue and he swung his arms about his body in the
hope of getting a livelier circulation of blood as he spoke.“Under the equator!” scoffed Ben.“Better say ‘under the Arctic circle!’
What are we camping here for, anyway?” he added impatiently, springing
to his feet.“Why not drop down into a region where the equator isn’t
covered with ice a foot thick?”

“You wanted to pass a night up here!” laughed Carl, stopping in front of
the two boys, his eyes dancing with mischief, his cheeks flushed from
exercise.“You told us how you wanted to breathe the cool, sweet air of
the hills!Now breathe it!”

“The cool, sweet air of the hills,” Ben retorted, “reminds me of the
atmosphere of the big refrigerator at home.”

Glenn Richards now joined the little group and stood laughing at the
disgusted expression on the face of his chum.“Didn’t I tell you,” he exclaimed, “that Ecuador is the land of
contradictions?When you come here, you bring a peck or two of quinine
tablets, a bundle or two of mosquito netting, and a couple of bales of
fans.You bring your summer clothing, and don’t expect to wear much of
that.Then you go on a trip up-country and freeze to death where the ice
is about nine thousand feet thick!”

“I know where all the heat goes!” Jimmie declared.“It pours out of
those big peaks you see off there.How do you suppose the earth is going
to keep any warmth in it when it is all running out at volcanoes?”

The boys were, perhaps, twenty miles north of Quito, almost exactly
under the equator.From the plateau on which they were encamped several
ancient volcanoes were in plain view.I guess the volcanoes we see are about burned out!” Carl declared.“At any rate, I don’t hear of their filling in any valleys with lava.”

“I guess about all they do now is to smoke,” Ben suggested.“And that’s a bad habit, too!” Glenn Richards grinned.“Now, I’ll tell you what we’d better do, boys,” Glenn said, after
glancing disapprovingly at the small fire.“We’d better hop on the
machines and drop down about ten thousand feet.I’ve got enough of this
high mountain business.”

“All right!” Jimmie returned.“You know what you said about wanting
experiences which were out of the way.If you think you’ve got one here,
we’ll slide down to the green grass.”

It was late in November and the hot, dry season of the South American
continent was on.Far below the boys could see the dark green of
luxuriant vegetation, while all around them lay the bare brown peaks of
lofty plateaus and lifting mountain cones.As it was somewhere near the middle of the afternoon, the boys lost no
time in packing their camp equipage and provisions on the aeroplanes.In
order to find a suitable place for a camp lower down they might be
obliged to traverse considerable country.In describing this part of the continent a traveler once crumpled a
sheet of paper in his hand and tossed it on the table, saying to a
friend as he did so that that was an outline map of the northern part of
South America.There were many gorges and plateaus, but only a few spots
where aeroplanes might land with safety.After quite a long flight, during which the machines soared around
cliffs and slid into valleys and gorges, the boys found a green valley
watered by the Esmeraldas river.Here they dropped down, and the
shelter-tents were soon ready for occupancy.“I suppose,” Carl grumbled as provisions were taken from the flying
machines and brought to the vicinity of the fire, “that we’ll have to
fight thousands of kinds of crawling and creeping things before
morning!”

“Well,” Jimmie laughed, “you wouldn’t stay up there where the flying and
creeping things don’t live!”

“My private opinion,” declared Glenn, “is that we ought to spend most of
our time in the air!I wish we could sleep on the machines!”

“Where are we going, anyhow?” demanded Jimmie.“We’re going to follow the backbone of the South American continent
clear to Cape Horn!” replied Ben.“That is, if our flying machines and
our tempers hold out!”

“I have an idea,” Glenn said, “that we’ll spend most of the time in
Peru, which is probably the oldest country in the world so far as
civilization is concerned.”

“That’s another dream!” exclaimed Carl.“Look here,” Glenn exclaimed, “there are still temples and palaces in
Peru which date back beyond the remotest reach of tradition.The
earliest Incas believed that many of the fortresses, castles and temples
which they found there were formed by the gods when the world was made.”

“That’s going back a long ways!” laughed Jimmie.“There’s a lake in Peru called Titicaca on an island in the middle of
which lies an ancient palace and many other structures,” Glenn went on.“Gathered about it are the remains of a civilization that was old when
the people of Europe consisted of a group of semi-heathen tribes
wandering from place to place.There are palaces surpassing anything to
be seen on the Rhine, and castles which had fallen into decay before
civilization began at the mouth of the Nile.”

“Go to it!” laughed Carl.“Make it good and old while you’re about it!”

“On the island of Titicaca,” continued Glenn, “are marvels in
architecture which make the wonders of Egypt look like thirty cents!There are massive fortifications perched on the sides of almost
perpendicular cliffs, and even to-day there are large stones carefully
balanced on the verge of precipices, ready to be pushed off at a
moment’s notice and sent crashing down on the legions of an attacking
foe.”

“Those old fellows must have been fighters!” commented Ben.“They were fighters, all right!” Glenn went on.“They ruled all that
part of the world until the Spaniards came.They were very
superstitious, the sun being an object of worship.The Temple of the
Sun, on the island of Titicaca, was one of the most magnificent
structures ever erected.Outside and inside the walls were lined with
gold and precious stones.The temple was the pride of the Incas, but it
was stripped of its rich covering by the Spaniards.The walls were torn
down and rifled, and the sacred sun was seized and gambled for by the
covetous invaders.Nothing that could be converted into money was
overlooked.And since that time the Incas have become one of the lowest
races on the face of the earth.”

“I suppose we shall be able to inspect a lot of these old temples?”
asked Carl.“Undoubtedly!” Glenn answered.“Some of them are deserted; some are
occupied by native Indians, and some are said to be frequented by the
spirits of those who erected them.”

“Gee!That sounds good to me!” exclaimed Jimmie.“A haunted temple might help some!” Carl exclaimed.“There really is a temple down on Lake Titicaca!” declared Glenn, “which
even Europeans declare to be inhabited by the Evil One.”

“That’s where I’m headed for!” declared Jimmie.“Any old time you show
me a mystery you’ll see me on the job!”

“There’s a mystery there, all right!” Glenn insisted.“The temple stands
on a winding arm of the lake, and is entirely surrounded by broken
country.So difficult is it of access that for years no one attempted to
visit it.Then, a few years ago, a party of Englishmen made their way to
the ruins and found themselves in an atmosphere of mystery almost
resembling magic.”

“What did they see?” asked Ben.“I don’t remember exactly what they all saw,” Glenn answered.Some saw figures in white—the long flowing robes
of priests—some saw strange lights suspended in the air; some heard the
most mournful and terrifying sounds.”

“And these Englishmen were supposed to be people of average
intelligence?” asked Ben.“There were scientists in the party!” was the reply.“There is no such word as ghost in the dictionary of the scientist!”
laughed Carl.“Following the stories told by the visitors,” Glenn went on, “a number
of people visited the vicinity of the temple, and all came away with
tales more vivid and more imaginative than those of the scientists.For
two years now the place has been left entirely alone.”

“We might go there and camp!” suggested Carl.“I move we take a look at it!” Jimmie cut in.“We can fly down on the
roof and get away before the goblins get us.”

“I’m game for anything you boys decide on,” Glenn declared, “but my
private opinion is that it will be only a waste of time for us to pay
much attention to the haunted temple!”

“The ghosts wouldn’t like us if we should leave their country without
making a formal call!” laughed Carl.“Who’s going to get supper?” asked Jimmie in a moment.“I feel like I
could eat one of the wild beasts which are said to flourish in this
region!”

“There isn’t much supper to get!” replied Ben, with, a laugh.“All we
have is a couple of pounds of ham, a few eggs, and a lot of tinned
provisions.Why don’t one of you boys go
and catch a fish?”

“Aw, I don’t believe there’s any fish in that river!” grinned Jimmie.“If there are fish there, they’ll be tough eating for they must be
acrobats!”

“Why acrobats?” asked Glenn.“Because they must stand on their heads and turn handsprings in order to
get something to eat in that swift water!”

“I believe we can get a fish for supper, just the same!” insisted Carl,
“and I’m going to get out a line and an imitation minnow and go try!”

“May the luck of the hungry fisherman go with you!” laughed Ben.“He’ll have better company than that!” Jimmie grinned.“I’m going along
myself!”

While Glenn and Ben arranged the camp for the night Jimmie and Carl
started away down the <DW72> leading to the river.Directly in front of
the tents the bank was clear of undergrowth, and covered with grass
almost waist high.Lower down, however, to the west, was a great thicket
which seemed to extend for miles.The opposite shore of the stream was
heavily wooded for some distance up.Above, the timber line showed the
bare, brown <DW72>s of mountains.When the two boys reached the bank of the stream the prospects were not
attractive, the water being broken into rapids and falls by jagged rocks
which occupied the bed of the river at this point.To the west, however,
where the stream entered the forest, the surface of the water appeared
to be unbroken, so the lads made their way in that direction.In a few
minutes their lines were out and almost instantly sharp twitches at the
hooks informed the boys that they were not fishing in barren waters.But before the first fish was landed an exciting interruption occurred.WHAT THE FISHERMEN CAUGHT.Seated with his back to the thicket, Jimmie heard a rustle and turned
about expecting to see one of his chums.Instead, he saw the ugly, vicious face of an Ecuadorian savage.While he
looked, the fellow was joined by another, equally repulsive and equally
naked.During that first moment of amazement Jimmie dropped his fish
pole and it went bobbing down the river.“Carl!” he said, in a low whisper.The boy shouted back from lower down the stream.“Got a fish?”

“Come up and see!” cried Jimmie.Carl came panting through the undergrowth, and Jimmie pointed with a
hand which was not quite steady at the two figures in the underbrush
just back of him.“Look what I’ve found!” he whispered.“Did you call me up to give me my share?” asked Carl.“If you did, I
don’t want it!You’re welcome to everything you find in that line!”

“Gee!” Jimmie exclaimed.“I wish we were back by the machines!”

“I wish so, too!” Carl put in.“I wonder why they stand there looking at
us in that way.”

“Maybe they’re out after supper, too!” remarked Jimmie.“Do they eat folks?” asked Carl.“The savages who come over from the Amazon valley eat folks,” Jimmie
answered, “and those fellows look as if they came from that
neighborhood.”

“Let’s start on up toward camp and see if they will interfere!”
suggested Carl.“Have you got a gun with you?” asked Jimmie.“Of course not!” was the reply.“I didn’t come out to shoot fish!”

“And I left mine at the camp, too!” Jimmie complained.“I’ll never do it
again!”

“Well, let’s make a start and see what comes of it!” suggested Carl.As the boys moved away the savages, men of medium height but apparently
very strong and supple, lifted naked arms in gestures which commanded
them to remain where they were.“I wonder if they’ve got guns?” questioned Jimmie.“They’ve got little short spears!” answered Carl.“I saw one in that
fellow’s hand.”

“And I suppose they’re poisoned, too!” Jimmie asserted.The two savages now advanced from the thicket and stood threateningly
before the two boys.Except for breech-clouts, which seemed to be woven
of some sort of fiber, the men were naked.In color they were almost as
dark as the <DW64> of Africa.Their features seemed to be a cross between
the tribes of Asia and Africa.They were armed with short spears which
they flourished with many hostile gestures.“Good-evening!” Jimmie said.The savages conversed together in a dialect which seemed to the boys to
resemble a confidential conversation between two hogs, and then pointed
down the river.“Here’s where we get abducted!” Carl exclaimed.“You needn’t get funny about it!” Jimmie expostulated.“This is no
joke!”

“Anyhow,” Carl went on, “the ginks don’t know anything about good
manners.They never answered your salutation!”

The savages were still uttering what appeared to be wordless commands,
and, as they continued to point down the river, very reluctantly the
boys started in that direction.“I wonder if the brutes have captured the camp, too?” queried Jimmie.“Oh, I suppose so!” Carl answered.“These fellows travel in droves, like
wild hogs, and I guess we lit right in the middle of a large tribe.”

In spite of the impatience expressed by the gestures of their captors,
the boys proceeded very slowly.As they walked they listened for some
indication of trouble at the camp.They knew that Glenn and Ben were
well armed, and that they would not submit to capture without first
putting up a spirited defence.“We haven’t heard any shooting yet,” Jimmie said in a moment.“I don’t believe there’s any use of our being lugged off in this style!”
Carl advised.“We ought to be able to break away from these brutes and
get back to camp.Sandra travelled to the bedroom.The boys there are all right up to this time, for we
haven’t heard any fighting, and the four of us ought to be able to
induce these two savages to beat it!”

“If we can only get back to the flying machines,” Jimmie suggested, “we
can get away, all right.I believe these fellows would drop dead if they
saw the _Louise_ or the _Bertha_ slanting up into the air!”

“Well, then, let’s make a break!” Carl advised.“All right!” Jimmie replied.“When we get to the next jungle where the
bushes are so thick they can’t throw a spear very far, you duck one way
and I’ll duck the other, and we’ll both make for the camp.”

The boys knew very well that they were in a perilous situation.The
savages were more familiar with travel through underbrush than
themselves.Besides, they would undoubtedly be able to make better time
than boys reared on city streets.In addition to all this, the spears
they carried might carry death on every tip.However, to remain seemed fully as dangerous as to attempt to escape.So
when they came to a particularly dense bit of jungle the boys darted
away.As they did so Jimmie felt a spear whiz within an inch of his
head, and Carl felt the push of one as it entered his sleeve.Dodging
swiftly this way and that, uttering cries designed to bring their chums
to their assistance, the boys forced their way through the undergrowth
some distance in advance of their pursuers.Every moment they expected to feel the sting of a spear, or to be seized
from behind by a brown, muscular hand.After all it was their voices and
not their ability as runners which brought about their rescue.Hearing the cries of their chums, Ben and Glenn sprang for their guns
and, walking swiftly toward the river, began firing, both for the
purpose of directing the boys toward the camp and with the added purpose
of frightening away any hostile element, either human or animal, walking
on four legs or on two.Panting, and scarcely believing in their own
good fortune, Jimmie and Carl presently came to where their chums stood
not far from the machines.Both boys dropped down in the long grass the
instant they felt themselves under the protection of the automatics in
the hands of their friends.To say that Glenn and Ben were surprised at the sudden appearance of
their chums only feebly expresses the situation.The savages had not
followed the boys into the open plaza where the grass grew, and so there
was no physical explanation of the incident.“What’s doing?” demanded Glenn.“You must be running for exercise!” Ben put in.“For the love of Mike!” exclaimed Jimmie, panting and holding his hands
to his sides.“Get back to the machines and throw the truck on board!These woods are full of head-hunters!”

“What did you see?” asked Ben.“Savages!” answered Jimmie.“They got us, too!” Carl put in.“They did?” demanded Glenn.“Then how did you get away?”

“Ran away!” answered Jimmie scornfully.“You don’t suppose we flew, do
you?I guess we’ve been going some!”

“Where are the savages now?” demanded Glenn.“I don’t know!” Jimmie answered.“I don’t want to know where they are.I
want to know where they ain’t!”

“Come on!” Carl urged.“Let’s get back to the machines!”

Glenn and Ben did not seem to take the incident as seriously as did
their chums.In fact, they were rather inclined to make facetious
remarks about little boys being frightened at black men in the woods.Ben was even in favor of advancing into the thicket on a tour of
investigation, but Jimmie argued him out of the idea.“They’re savages, all right!” the latter insisted.“They’re naked, and
they’re armed with spears.Look to me like head-hunters from the Amazon
valley!If you go into the thicket you’re likely to get a couple of
spears into your frame!”

“Then I won’t go!” Ben grinned.“Come on,” urged Carl, “it’s getting dark, so we’d better be getting
back to camp!Perhaps the <DW65>s have beaten us to it already!”

“I guess the two you saw are about the only ones in the vicinity,”
answered Glenn.“You’d feel pretty cheap, wouldn’t you, if you’d get back to camp and
find that the savages had taken possession?” demanded Jimmie.Thus urged, Glenn and Ben finally abandoned the idea of advancing into
the forest.Instead, they turned their faces toward the camp, and all
four boys advanced with ever-increasing speed as they neared the spot
where the aeroplanes and the tents had been left.About the first thing they saw as they came within sight of the broad
planes of the flying machines was a naked savage inspecting the motors.He stood like a statue before the machine for an instant and then glided
away.They saw him turn about as he came to a cluster of underbrush,
beckon silently to some one, apparently on the other side of the camp,
and then disappear.“And that means,” Glenn whispered, “that the woods are full of ’em!”

“Oh, no,” jeered Jimmie, “the two we saw are the only ones there are in
the woods!I guess you’ll think there is something in the story we told
about being captured and abducted!”

The short tropical twilight had now entirely passed away.It seemed to
the boys as if a curtain had been drawn between themselves and the tents
and flying machines which had been so plainly in view a moment before.There was only the glimmer of the small camp-fire to direct them to
their camp.“Who’s got a searchlight?” asked Glenn.“I have!” replied Ben.“I never leave the camp without one!”

“Then use it!” advised Glenn, “and we will make for the machines.”

“Don’t you do it!” advised Jimmie.“They’ll throw spears at us!”

“Well, we’ve got to have a light in order to get the machines away!”
declared Carl.“Perhaps the <DW65>s will run when they see the
illumination.The light of a searchlight at a distance, you know,
doesn’t look like anything human or divine!”

It was finally decided to advance as cautiously and silently as possible
to the camp and spring at once to the machines.“We’ll never be clear of these savages until we get up in the air!”
declared Ben.“But that will leave our tents and our provisions, and about everything
we have except the machines, behind!” wailed Carl.“It won’t leave all the provisions behind!” declared Jimmie.“I’ll
snatch beans and bread if I get killed doing it!”

During their progress to the camp the boys neither saw nor heard
anything whatever of the savages.They found the fire burning brightly
and the provisions which had been set out for supper just as they had
been left.In fact, the statue-like
savage they had observed examining the flying machine now seemed to have
come out of a dream and retreated to his world of shadows again.“Perhaps it won’t be necessary to leave here to-night,” Glenn suggested.“I don’t think it’s safe to remain,” Ben contended.“You boys may stay if you want to!” Jimmie exclaimed.“But Carl and I
have had enough of this neck of the woods.We’ll take the _Louise_ and
fly over to Quito, and you can find us there when you get ready to move
on.You boys certainly take the cake for not knowing what’s good for
you!” he added with a grin.“Oh, well, perhaps we’d all better go!” Glenn advised.“I don’t see
anything nourishing in this part of the country, anyway.If you boys had
only brought home a couple of fish it might have been different.I’m of
the opinion that a square meal at Quito wouldn’t come amiss just now.”

“It’s so blooming dark I don’t know whether we can find the town or
not,” suggested Carl.“Oh, we can find it all right!” insisted Ben.“If the savages let us!” exclaimed Jimmie excitedly.“I don’t see any savages!” replied Glenn.“Can’t you hear them?” demanded Jimmie.“I think I can smell something!” Carl exclaimed.“Don’t get gay, now!” Jimmie answered.If
you’ll listen, you’ll hear the snakes creeping through the grass.”

The boys listened intently for an instant and then, without looking into
the tents, sprang toward the machines.It seemed for a moment as if a
thousand voices were shouting at them.They seemed to be in the center
of a circle of men who were all practicing a different style of
war-whoop.To this day the boys assert that it was the whirling of the electric
searchlights which kept the savages from advancing upon them.At any
rate, for a time, the unseen visitors contented themselves with verbal
demonstrations.“We’ll have to jump out on the machines!” advised Glenn.“We can’t fight
a whole army!”

“Why, there’s only two!” Jimmie taunted.“You said yourself that we saw
all the black men there were in this neighborhood!”

“Aw, keep still,” Ben cried.“We haven’t got time to listen to you boys
joke each other!You and I for the _Louise_!”

It was now very dark, for banks of clouds lay low in the valley, but the
boys knew that the machines were situated so as to run smoothly until
the propellers and the planes brought them into the air.With a chorus of savage yells still ringing in their ears, the boys
leaped into their seats, still swinging their searchlights frantically
as their only means of protection, and pressed the starters.The
machines ran ahead smoothly for an instant then lifted.The boys were certain
that if they could have looked down upon the savages who had been so
threatening a moment before they would have seen them on their knees
with their faces pressed to the ground.“They’ll talk about this night for a thousand years!” Jimmie screamed in
Ben’s ear as the _Louise_ swept into and through a stratum of cloud.“They’ll send it down to future generations in legends of magic.”

“Little do we care what they think of us after we get out of their
clutches!” Ben called back.“It seems like a miracle, our getting away
at all!”

“Do you really think they are head-hunters?” shouted Jimmie.“You saw more of them than I did,” Ben answered.After passing through the clouds the starlight showed the way, and in a
very short time the lights of Quito were seen glittering twenty miles or
so to the south.“What are we going to do when we get to the town?” shouted Jimmie.“Hire some one to watch the machines and get a square meal!” Ben
replied.“And buy new tents and provisions and everything of that kind!”
he went on.“I suppose those savages will have a fine time devouring our
perfectly good food.”

“And they’ll probably use the oiled-silk tents for clothing!” laughed
Jimmie.“I wonder if we can buy more at Quito.”

“Of course we can!” replied Ben.“Quito has a hundred thousand
inhabitants, and there are plenty of European places of business there!”

The _Bertha_ with Glenn and Carl on board was some distance in advance,
and directly the boys on the _Louise_ saw the leading machine swing
about in a circle and then gradually drop to the ground.Ben, who was
driving the _Louise_, adopted the same tactics, and very soon the two
flying machines lay together in an open field, perhaps a mile distant
from Quito, the capital of Ecuador, the city known throughout the world
as the “City of Eternal Spring.”

It was dark at the ground level, there being only the light of the
stars, faintly seen through drifting masses of clouds, many hundred feet
higher here than those which had nestled over the valley.“What next?” asked Carl as the four boys leaped from their seats and
gathered in a little group.“Supper next!” shouted Jimmie.“But we can’t all leave the machines!” declared Glenn.“Don’t you ever worry about the machines being left alone!” asserted
Ben.“Our lights will bring about a thousand people out here within the
next ten minutes.Dark as it is, our machines were undoubtedly seen
before we landed, and there’ll soon be an army here asking questions.We’ll have little trouble in finding English-speaking people in the
mob.”

“I guess that’s right!” Jimmie agreed.“Here comes the gang right now!”

A jumble of English, Spanish and French was now heard, and directly a
dozen or more figures were seen advancing across the field to where the
flying machines had landed.“There’s some one talking United States, all right!” Jimmie declared.Directly the visitors came up to where the boys were standing and began
gazing about, some impudently, some curiously and some threateningly.“Keep your hands off the machines!” Glenn warned, as a dusky native
began handling the levers.The fellow turned about and regarded the boy with an impudent stare.He
said something in Spanish which Glenn did not understand, and then
walked away to a group of natives who were whispering suspiciously
together.“Where are you from?” asked a voice in English as Glenn examined the
levers to see that nothing had been removed or displaced.“Gee!” exclaimed Jimmie.“That United States talk sounds good to me!”

The man who had spoken now turned to Jimmie and repeated his question.“Where do you boys come from?”

“New York,” Jimmie replied.“And you came across the Isthmus of Panama?” was the next question.“Sure we did!” answered the boy.“Well,” the stranger said, “my name is Bixby, Jim Bixby, and I’ve been
looking for you for two days.”

“Is that so?” asked Jimmie incredulously.“You see,” Bixby went on, “I am a dealer in automobile supplies,
probably the only one doing a large business in this part of the
country.Some days ago I received a telegram from Louis Havens, the
millionaire aviator, saying that four pupils of his were coming this
way, and advising me to take good care of you.”

“Where did Mr.Havens wire from?” asked Jimmie.“First from New York,” was the reply, “and then from New Orleans.It
seems that he started away from New York on the day following your
departure, and that he has been having trouble with the _Ann_ all the
way down.His last telegram instructed me to ask you to wait here until
his arrival.He ought to be here sometime to-morrow.”

“That’ll be fine!” exclaimed Jimmie.“And now,” Bixby went on, “you’ll have to employ two or three fellows to
watch your machines for the night.The natives would carry them away
piecemeal if you left them here unguarded.”

“Perhaps you can pick out two or three trusty men,” suggested Glenn.“I have had three men in mind ever since I received my first message
from Mr.Havens!” replied Bixby.“When your machine was sighted in the
air not long ago, I ’phoned to their houses and they will undoubtedly be
here before long.”

“How’ll they know where to come?” asked Jimmie.“Don’t you think that half the people in Quito don’t know where these
wonders of the air lighted!” Bixby laughed.“The news went over the city
like lightning when your planes showed.Your lights, of course, revealed
your exact whereabouts to those on this side of the town, and telephones
and messenger boys have done the rest.”

While the boys talked with this very welcome and friendly visitor, the
clamor of an automobile was heard, and directly two great acetylene eyes
left the highway and turned, bumping and swaying, into the field.“There will be damages to pay for mussing up this grass!” Carl
suggested, as a fresh crowd of sight-seers followed the machine into the
enclosure.“Of course,” replied Bixby, “and they’ll try to make you pay ten times
what the damage really amounts to.I can
handle these fellows better than you can!”

“We shall be glad to have you do so!” Glenn replied.In a moment the automobile ran up to the planes and stopped.Of the four
men it contained, three alighted and approached Bixby.“These are the guards,” the latter said turning to the boys.The men, who seemed both willing and efficient, drew a long rope and
several steel stakes from the automobile and began enclosing the
machines with the same.As the rope was strung out, the constantly
increasing crowd was pushed back beyond the circle.“Won’t they make trouble for the guards during the night?” asked Ben.“I think not,” was the reply.“I have already arranged for a number of
native policemen to assist these men.”

“Gee!” exclaimed Carl, “I guess Mr.Havens picked out the right man!”

“How did he know we were going to stop at Quito?” asked Ben.“He didn’t know!” replied Bixby.“But he surmised that you’d be obliged
to land here in order to fill your fuel tanks.”

“Well, we didn’t come here for that purpose,” laughed Glenn.“We came
here because the savages chased us out of a cute little valley about
twenty miles away!”

“It’s a wonder you got away at all if they saw you!” said Bixby.“I guess they didn’t seem to understand about our motors getting into
the air!” laughed Jimmie.“The minute the wheel left the ground their
war-cries ceased.”

“It’s a wonder you were permitted to get to the machines at all if they
caught you away from them!” said Bixby.“Aw, we always have the luck of the Irish,” Jimmie replied.“The
shooting and the display of electric searchlights kept them away until
we got into the seats and our way of ascending into the sky did the
rest.”

“You are very lucky boys!” insisted Bixby.“It’s nice to hear you say so!” Ben answered, “because we’re going to
follow this line of mountains down to Cape Horn, and visit every ruined
temple on the route that has a ghost on its visiting list.”

“If you’ll listen to the stories you hear in the cities,” laughed Bixby,
“you’ll visit a good many ruined temples.”

“Glenn was telling us about a temple down on Lake Titicaca,” Ben
replied.“He says that figures in flowing white robes appear in the
night-time, and are seen by the light that emanates from their own
figures!He says, too, that there are illuminations of red, and green,
and yellow, which come from no determinable source, and that there are
noises which come out of the clear air unaccounted for!”

“There is such a temple, isn’t there, Mr.“There is a temple about which such stories are told,” laughed Bixby.“Are you boys thinking of going there?”

“Sure thing, we’re going there!” asserted Jimmie.During this conversation the three men who had been employed by Bixby to
guard the flying machine during the night had been standing by in
listening attitudes.When the haunted temple and the proposed visit of
the boys to it was mentioned, one of them whose name had been given as
Doran, touched Jimmie lightly on the shoulder.“Are you really going to that haunted temple?” he asked.Jimmie nodded, and in a short time the four boys and Bixby left for the
city in the automobile.As they entered the machine Jimmie thought that
he caught a hostile expression on Doran’s face, but the impression was
so faint that he said nothing of the matter to his chums.In an hour’s time Bixby and the four boys were seated at dinner in the
dining-room of a hotel which might have been on Broadway, so perfect
were its appointments.“Now let me give you a little advice,” Bixby said, after the incidents
of the journey had been discussed.“Never talk about prospective visits
to ruined temples in South America.There is a general belief that every
person who visits a ruin is in quest of gold, and many a man who set out
to gratify his own curiosity has never been heard of again!”




                              CHAPTER IV.PLANNING A MIDNIGHT RIDE.“If the people of the country believe there is gold in the temples said
to be haunted,” Glenn asked, “why don’t they hunt for it themselves,
without waiting for others to come down and give them a tip?”

“Generally speaking,” replied Bixby, “every ruin in Peru has been
searched time and again by natives.Millions of treasure has been found,
but there is still the notion, which seems to have been born into every
native of South America, that untold stores of gold, silver and precious
stones are still concealed in the ruined temples.”

“What I can’t understand is this,” Glenn declared.“Why should these
natives, having every facility for investigation, follow the lead of
strangers who come here mostly for pleasure?”

“I can’t understand that part of it myself,” Bixby replied, “except on
the theory that the natives ascribe supernatural powers to foreigners.Even the most intelligent natives who do not believe in the magic of
Europeans, watch them closely when they visit ruins, doubtless on the
theory that in some way the visitors have become posted as to the
location of treasure.”

“Well,” Ben observed, “they can’t make much trouble for us, because we
can light down on a temple, run through it before the natives can get
within speaking distance, and fly away again.”

“All the same,” Bixby insisted, “I wouldn’t talk very much about
visiting ruins of any kind.And here’s another thing,” he went on,
“there are stories afloat in Peru that fugitives from justice sometimes
hide in these ruins.And so, you see,” he added with a laugh, “you are
likely to place yourself in bad company in the minds of the natives by
being too inquisitive about the methods of the ancient Incas.”

“All right,” Glenn finally promised, “we’ll be careful about mentioning
ruins in the future.”

After dinner the boys went to Bixby’s place of business and ordered
gasoline enough to fill the tanks.They also ordered an extra supply of
gasoline, which was to be stored in an auxiliary container of rubber
made for that purpose.“Now about tents and provisions?” asked Bixby.“Confound those savages!” exclaimed Jimmie.“We carried those oiled-silk
shelter-tents safely through two long journeys in the mountains of
California and Mexico, and now we have to turn them over to a lot of
savages in Ecuador!I believe we could have frightened the brutes away
by doing a little shooting!Anyway, I wish we’d tried it!”

“Not for mine!” exclaimed Carl.“I don’t want to go through the country
killing people, even if they are South American savages.”

“I may be able to get you a supply of oiled-silk in Quito,” Bixby
suggested, “but I am not certain.It is very expensive, you understand,
of course, and rather scarce.”

“The expense is all right,” replied Glenn, “but we felt a sort of
sentimental attachment for those old shelter-tents.We can get all the
provisions we need here, of course?” he added.“Certainly,” was the reply.“Look here!” Jimmie cut in.“What time will there be a moon to-night?”

“Probably about one o’clock,” was the reply.“By that time, however, you
ought all to be sound asleep in your beds.”

“What’s the idea, Jimmie?” asked Carl.The boys all saw by the quickening expressions in the two boys’ faces
that they had arrived at an understanding as to the importance of
moonlight on that particular night.“Why, I thought—” began Jimmie.“I just thought it might not do any harm
to run back to that peaceful little glade to see if the tents really
have been removed or destroyed!”

“Impossible!” advised Bixby.“The tents may remain just where you left
them, but, even if they are there, you may have no chance of securing
them.It is a risky proposition!”

“What do you mean?” asked Ben.“I mean that the superstition of the savages may restrain them from
laying hands on the tents and provisions you left,” replied Bixby, “but,
at the same time,” he continued, “they may watch the old camp for days
in the hope of your return.”

“What’s the idea?” asked Glenn.“Do they want to eat us?” asked Jimmie.“Some of the wild tribes living near the head waters of the Amazon,”
Bixby explained, “are crazy over the capture of white men.They are said
to march them back to their own country in state, and to inaugurate long
festivals in honor of the victory.And during the entire festival,”
Bixby went on, “the white prisoners are subjected to tortures of the
most brutal description!”

“Say,” giggled Jimmie, giving Carl a dig in the ribs with his elbow,
“let’s take the train for Guayaquil to-morrow morning!I don’t think
it’s right for us to take chances on the savages having all the fun!”

“As between taking the first train for Guayaquil and taking a trip
through the air to the old camp to-night,” Bixby laughed, “I certainly
advise in favor of the former.”

“Aw, that’s all talk,” Ben explained, as Bixby, after promising to look
about in the morning for oiled-silk and provisions, locked his place of
business and started toward the hotel with the boys.“What do you say to it, Carl?” Jimmie asked, as the two fell in behind
the others.“I’m game!” replied Carl.“Then I’ll tell you what we’ll do!” Jimmie explained.“You and I will
get a room together and remain up until moonrise.If the sky is clear of
clouds at that time, and promises to remain so until morning, we’ll load
ourselves down with all the guns we can get hold of and fly out to the
old camp.It’ll be a fine ride, anyway!”

“Pretty chilly, though, in high altitudes at this time of night,”
suggested Carl.“I’m most frozen now!”

“So’m I,” Jimmie replied, “and I’ll tell you what we’ll do!When we
start away we’ll swipe blankets off the bed.I guess they’ll keep us
warm.”

“Well, we’ll have to keep Glenn and Ben from knowing anything about the
old trip,” Carl suggested.“Of course they couldn’t prevent us going,
but they’d put up a kick that would make it unpleasant.”

“Indeed they would!” answered Jimmie.“But, at the same time, they’d go
themselves if they’d got hold of the idea first.I suggested it, you
know, and that’s one reason why they would reject it.”

Arrived at the hotel, Jimmie and Carl had no difficulty in getting a
double room, although their chums looked rather suspiciously at them as
they all entered the elevator.“Now,” said Ben, “don’t you boys get into any mischief to-night.Quito
isn’t a town for foreigners to explore during the dark hours!”

“I’m too sleepy to think of any midnight adventures!” cried Jimmie with
a wink and a yawn.“Me, too!” declared Carl.“I’ll be asleep in about two minutes!”

It was about ten o’clock when the boys found themselves alone in a large
room which faced one of the leading thoroughfares of the capital city.Quito is well lighted by electricity, and nearly all the conveniences of
a city of the same size in the United States are there to be had.The street below the room occupied by the two boys was brilliantly
lighted until midnight, and the lads sat at a window looking out on the
strange and to them unusual scene.When the lights which flashed from
business signs and private offices were extinguished, the thoroughfare
grew darker, and then the boys began seriously to plan their proposed
excursion.“What we want to do,” Jimmie suggested, “is to get out of the hotel
without being discovered and make our way to a back street where a cab
can be ordered.It is a mile to the field where the machines were left,
and we don’t want to lose any time.”

Before leaving the room the boys saw that their automatic revolvers and
searchlights were in good order.They also made neat packages of the
woolen blankets which they found on the bed and carried them away.“Now,” said Jimmie as they reached a side street and passed swiftly
along in the shadow of a row of tall buildings, “we’ve got to get into a
cab without attracting any attention, for we’ve stolen the hotel’s
blankets, and we can’t talk Spanish, and if a cop should seize us we’d
have a good many explanations to make.”

“I don’t think it’s good sense to take the blankets,” Carl objected.“Aw, you’ll think so when we get a couple of thousand feet up in the air
on the _Louise_!” laughed Jimmie.After walking perhaps ten minutes, the boys came upon a creaking old cab
drawn by a couple of the sorriest-looking horses they had ever seen.The
driver, who sat half asleep on the seat, jumped down to the pavement and
eyed the boys suspiciously as they requested to be taken out to where
the machines had been left.The lads were expecting a long tussle between the English and the
Spanish languages, but the cabman surprised them by answering their
request in excellent English.“So?” exclaimed Jimmie.“You talk United States, too, do you?Where did
you come from?”

“You want to go out to the machines, do you?” asked the cabman, without
appearing to notice the question.“That’s where we want to go!” replied Carl.“What for?” asked the cabman.“None of your business!” replied Jimmie.“I’ve been out there once to-night!” said the cabman, “and the party I
drew beat me out of my fare.”

“That’s got nothing to do with us!” replied Carl.“It’ll cost you ten dollars!” growled the cabman.“Say, look here!” Jimmie exclaimed.“You’re a bigger robber than the New
York cabmen!It’s only a mile to the field, and we’ll walk just to show
you that we don’t have to use your rickety old cab.”

With a snarl and a frown the cabman climbed back up on his seat and gave
every appearance of dropping into sound slumber.“Now what do you think of that for a thief?” asked Carl, as the boys
hastened away toward the field.“I’d walk ten miles before I’d give that
fellow a quarter!”

“We’ve got plenty of time,” Jimmie answered.“The moon won’t be up for
an hour yet.Perhaps we’d better walk up anyway, for then we can enter
the field quietly and see what’s going on.”

On the way out the lads met several parties returning from the field,
and when they reached the opening in the fence they saw that many
curious persons were still present.There were at least half a dozen
vehicles of different kinds gathered close about the roped-off circle.“Say,” Carl exclaimed as the boys passed into the field, “look at that
old rattletrap on the right.Isn’t that the same vehicle the cabman
pretended to go asleep on as we came away?”

“Sure it is!” answered Jimmie.“I don’t remember the appearance of the
cab so well, but I know just how the horses looked.”

“He must have found a ten-dollar fare out here!” Carl suggested.“Yes, and he must have come out by a roundabout way in order to prevent
our seeing him.Now what do you think he did that for?Why should he
care whether we see him or not?”

As the boy asked the question the rig which they had been discussing was
driven slowly away, not in the direction of the road, but toward the
back end of the field.“Something mighty funny going on here!” Jimmie declared.“I guess it’s a
good thing we came out.”

When the boys came up to where the machines were lying, Doran was the
first one to approach.“Little nervous about your machines, eh?” he asked.“Rather,” replied Jimmie.“We came out with the idea of taking a short
trip to see if they still are in working order.”

“Well,” Doran said with a scowl, “of course you know that you can’t take
the machines out without an order from Mr.Bixby!”




                               CHAPTER V.

                          A WAIF AND A STRAY.“Bixby doesn’t own these machines!” exclaimed Carl angrily.“Who does own them?” demanded Doran.“We four boys own them!” was the reply.“Well, you’ve got to show me!” insisted Doran, insolently.“I’ll tell you what we’ll do!” Jimmie announced.“We’ll go right back to
Bixby and put you off the job!”

“Go as far as you like,” answered Doran.“I was put here to guard these
machines and I intend to do it.You can’t bluff me!”

While the boys stood talking with the impertinent guard they saw two
figures moving stealthily about the aeroplanes.Jimmie hastened over to
the _Louise_ and saw a man fumbling in the tool-box.“What are you doing here?” demanded the boy.The intruder turned a startled face for an instant and then darted away,
taking the direction the cab had taken.Carl and Doran now came running up and Jimmie turned to the latter.“Nice old guard you are!” he almost shouted.“Here you stand talking
with us while men are sneaking around the machines!”

“Was there some one here?” asked Doran in assumed amazement.“There surely was!” replied Jimmie.“Where are the other guards?”

“Why,” replied Doran hesitatingly, “they got tired of standing around
doing nothing and went home.It’s pretty dull out here.”

“Well,” Jimmie answered, “I’m going to see if this machine has been
tampered with!Get up on one of the seats, Carl,” he said with a wink,
“and we’ll soon find out if any of the fastenings have been loosened.”

The boy was permitted to follow instructions without any opposition or
comment from Doran, and in a moment Jimmie was in the other seat with
the wheels in motion.Seeing too late the trick which had been played upon him, Doran uttered
an exclamation of anger and sprang for one of the planes.His fingers
just scraped the edge of the wing as the machine, gathering momentum
every instant, lifted from the ground, and he fell flat.He arose instantly to shake a threatening fist at the disappearing
aeroplane.Jimmie turned back with a grin on his freckled face.“Catch on behind,” he said, “and I’ll give you a ride!”

“Did you see some one fumbling around the machine?” asked Carl, as
Jimmie slowed the motors down a trifle in order to give a chance for
conversation.“Sure, I did!” was the reply.“He ducked away when he saw me coming, and
ran away into the field in the direction taken by the cab.”

“Gee!” exclaimed Carl.“Do you think the cabman brought that man out to
work some mischief with the flying machines?”

“I don’t think much about it,” Jimmie answered, “because I don’t know
much about it!He might have done something to the machine which will
cause us to take a drop in the air directly, but I don’t think so.Anyhow, it’s running smoothly now.”

“Still we’re taking chances!” insisted Carl.The moon now stood well up in the eastern sky, a round, red ball of fire
which looked to the lads large enough to shadow half the sky a little
later on.Below, the surface of the earth was clearly revealed in its
light.“We’ll have to hurry!” Carl suggested, “if we get back to the hotel
before daylight, so I’ll quit talking and you turn on more power.”

“I may not be able to find this blooming old valley where we left the
tents,” Jimmie grumbled.“If you remember, son, we left that locality in
something of a hurry!”

“I certainly remember something which looked to me like a jungle scene
in a comic opera!” grinned Carl.“And the noise sounded not unlike some
of the choruses I have heard in little old New York!”

Jimmie drove straight north for an hour, and then began circling to left
and right in search of the little valley from which they had fled so
precipitously.At last the gleam of running water caught his eyes and he
began volplaning down.“Are you sure that’s the place?” asked Carl, almost screaming the words
into Jimmie’s ears.“I don’t see any tents down there, do you?”

“I see something that looks like a tent,” Jimmie answered.“We are so
high up now that we couldn’t distinguish one of them anyhow.”

As the aeroplane drove nearer to the earth, a blaze flared up from
below.In its red light they saw the two shelter-tents standing in
exactly the same position in which they had been left.“There!” cried Jimmie.“I had an idea we’d find them!”

“But look at the fire!” cautioned Carl.“There’s some one there keeping
up that blaze!”

“That’s a funny proposition, too!” exclaimed Jimmie.“It doesn’t seem as
if the savages would remain on the ground after our departure.”

“And it doesn’t seem as if they would go away without taking everything
they could carry with them, either!” laughed Carl.“We can’t guess it out up here,” Jimmie argued.“We may as well light
and find out what it means.Have your guns ready, and shoot the first
savage who comes within range.”

When the rubber-tired wheels of the machine struck the ground which they
had occupied only a short time before, the boys found a great surprise
awaiting them.As if awakened from slumber by the clatter of the motors,
a figure dressed in nondescript European costume arose from the fire,
yawning and rubbing his eyes, and advanced to meet them.It was the figure of a young man of perhaps eighteen, though the ragged
and soiled clothing he wore, the unwashed face, the long hair, made it
difficult for one to give any accurate estimate as to the years of his
life.He certainly looked like a tramp, but he came forward with an air
of assurance which could not have been improved upon by a millionaire
hotel-keeper, or a haughty three-dollar-a-week clerk in a ten-cent
store.“Je-rusalem!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Now what do you think of this?”

“I saw him first!” declared Carl.“All right, you may have him!”

The intruder came forward and stood for a moment without speaking,
regarding the boys curiously in the meantime.“Well,” Jimmie said in a moment, “what about it?”

“I thought you’d be back,” said the other.“Where are the savages?” asked Carl.“Didn’t you bump into a war party
here?”

The stranger smiled and pointed to the tents.“I am a truthful man,” he said.“I wouldn’t tell a lie for a dollar.I
might tell six for five dollars, but I wouldn’t tell one lie for any
small sum.My name is Sam Weller, and I’m a tramp.”

“That’s no lie!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Unless appearances are deceiving!”

“Perhaps,” Carl suggested, “we’d better be getting out of here.The
natives may return.”

“As soon as you have given me time to relate a chapter of my life,” Sam
Weller continued, “you’ll understand why the savages won’t be back here
to-night.”

“Go on!” Jimmie grunted.“Tell us the story of your life, beginning with
the poor but dishonest parents and the statement that you were never
understood when you were a baby!”

“This chapter of my life,” Sam went on, without seeming to notice the
interruption, “begins shortly after sunset of the evening just passed.”

“Go ahead!” Carl exclaimed.“Get a move on!”

“While walking leisurely from the Isthmus of Panama to Cape Horn,” Sam
began, “I saw your two flying machines drop down into this valley.At
that time,” he continued, “I was in need of sustenance.I am happy to
state, however,” he added with a significant look in the direction of
half a dozen empty tin cans, “that at the present moment I feel no such
need.For the present I am well supplied.”

“Holy Mackerel!” exclaimed Carl.“But you’ve got your nerve.”

“My nerve is my fortune!” replied Sam whimsically.“But, to continue my
narrative,” he went on.“It seemed to me a dispensation of providence in
my favor when you boys landed in the valley.In my mind’s eye, I saw
plenty to eat and unexceptionable companionship.You were so thoroughly
interested in landing that I thought it advisable to wait for a more
receptive mood in which to present my petition for—for—well, not to put
too fine a point upon it, as Micawber would say—for grub.”

“Say!” laughed Carl.“It’s a sure thing you’ve panhandled in every state
in the union.”

Sam smiled grimly but continued without comment.“So I hid myself back there in the tall grass and waited for you to get
supper.Don’t you see,” he went on, “that when a boy’s hungry he doesn’t
radiate that sympathy for the unfortunate which naturally comes with a
full stomach.Therefore, I waited for you boys to eat your supper before
I asked for mine.”

“You’re all right, anyhow!” shouted Jimmie.“But it seems that your meal was long-delayed,” Sam went on, with a
little shrug of disgust.“I lay there in the long grass and waited,
hoping against hope.Then in a short time
I heard cries of terror and supplication.Then your two friends rushed
out to your assistance.Then, being entirely under the influence of
hunger and not responsible for my acts, I crawled into one of the tents
and began helping myself to the provisions.”

“And you were there when the savages flocked down upon us?” asked Carl.“You saw what took place after that?”

“I was there and I saw,” was the reply.“When you boys came running back
to the machines I stood ready to defend you with my life and two
automatic revolvers which I had found while searching through the
provisions.When you sprang into the machines and slipped away, leaving
the savages still hungry, I felt that my last hour had come.However, I
clung to the guns and a can of a superior brand of beans put up at
Battle Creek, Michigan.”

“How did you come out with the Indians?” asked Carl.“Did you tell them
the story of your life?”

“Hardly!” was the laughing reply.“I appeared at the door of the tent in
a chastened mood, it is true, ready for peace or war, but when I saw the
savages lying upon their hands and elbows, faces bowed to the tall
grass, I reached the conclusion that I had them—well Buffaloed!”

“The machines did it?” asked Jimmie.“The machines did it!” replied Sam.“The Indians bowed their heads for a
long time, and then gazed in awe at the disappearing aeroplanes.As I
said a moment ago, they were Buffaloed.When they saw me standing at the
door of the tent, they looked about for another machine.So did I for a
matter of fact, for I thought I needed one just about then!”

“Can you run a machine?” asked Carl.“Sure I can run a machine!” was the reply.“I can run anything from a
railroad train to a race with a township constable.Well, when the
machines disappeared, the savages vanished.Not a thing about the camp
was touched.I appointed myself custodian, and decided to remain here
until you came back after your tents.”

“Then where are you going?” asked Carl.“With your permission, I will place three days’ provisions under my belt
and be on my way.”

“Not three days’ supplies all at once?” questioned Jimmie.“All at once!” replied Sam.The two boys consulted together for a moment, and then Jimmie said:

“If you’ll help us pack the tents and provisions on the machine, we’ll
take you back to Quito with us.That is, if the _Louise_ will carry so
much weight.I think she will, but ain’t sure.”

“It surely will be a treat to ride in the air again!” declared the
tramp.“It has been a long time since Louis Havens kicked me out of his
hangar on Long Island for getting intoxicated and filling one of the
tanks with beer instead of gasoline.”

The boys smiled at each other significantly, for they well remembered
Mr.Havens’ story of the tramp’s rather humorous experience at the Long
Island establishment.However, they said nothing to Sam of this.“And, in the meantime,” the tramp said, pointing upward, “we may as well
wait here until we ascertain what that other machine is doing in the air
at this time of night!”




                              CHAPTER VI.Shortly after midnight Ben was awakened by a noise which seemed to come
from the door of his room.Half asleep as he was, it came to his
consciousness like the sparkling of a motor.There was the same sharp
tick, tick, tick, with regular pauses between.As he sat up in bed and listened, however, the sounds resolved
themselves into the rattle of one metal against another.In a minute he
knew that some one unfamiliar with the lock of his door was moving the
stem of a key against the metal plate which surrounded the key-hole.Then he heard the bolt shoot back and the door opened.There was an
electric switch on the wall within reach of his hand, and in a second
the room was flooded with light.The person who stood in the center of
the floor, halfway between the doorway and the bed, was an entire
stranger to the boy.He was dressed in clothing which would not have
been rejected by the head waiter of one of the lobster palaces on
Broadway, and his manner was pleasing and friendly.He smiled and dropped into a chair, holding out both hands when he saw
Ben’s eyes traveling from himself to an automatic revolver which lay on
a stand at the head of the bed.“Of course,” he said, then, as Ben sat down on the edge of the bed, “you
want to know what I’m doing here.”

“Naturally!” replied the boy.The man, who appeared to be somewhere near the age of twenty-five, drew
a yellow envelope from his pocket and tossed it over to Ben.“I am manager at the Quito telegraph office!” he said.“And I received
this despatch for you just before twelve o’clock.In addition to this I
received a personal message from Mr.Read your message and then
I will show you mine!”

Ben opened the envelope and read:

“Be sure and wait for me at the point where this message is delivered.Complications which can only be explained in person!”

The manager then passed his own despatch over to the boy.It read as
follows:

“Mr.Charles Mellen, Manager: Spare no expense in the delivery of the
message to Ben Whitcomb.If necessary, wire all stations on your circuit
for information regarding aeroplanes.If Whitcomb is at Quito, kindly
deliver this message in person, and warn him to be on the watch for
trouble.I hope to reach your town within twenty-four hours.”

“Now for an explanation regarding my surreptitious entrance into your
sleeping room,” Mellen went on.“My room is next to yours, and in order
not to awaken other sleepers, and at the same time make certain that you
understood the situation thoroughly, I tried my hand at burglary.”

“I am glad you did!” replied Ben.“For if there is anything serious in
the air it is quite important that no stir be created in the hotel at
this hour of the night.”

“That was just my idea!” Mellen answered.“I knew that if I asked the
clerk to send a page to your room every person in the hotel would know
all about the midnight visit in the morning.So far as I know,
understand, the complications hinted at by Mr.Havens may have had their
origin in Quito—perhaps in this very hotel.”

“It was very thoughtful of you,” answered Ben.Havens
personally?” he asked then.“Certainly!” was the reply.“He is a heavy stock-holder in the company I
represent; and it was partly through his influence that I secured my
present position.”

“After all,” smiled Ben, “this is a small world, isn’t it?The idea of
finding a friend of a friend up near the roof of the world!”

“Yes, it’s a small world,” replied Mellen.“Now tell me this,” he went
on, “have you any idea as to what Mr.Havens refers in his two rather
mysterious messages?”

“Not the slightest!” was the reply.“I wish we knew where to find Havens at this time,” mused Mellen.“I don’t think it will be possible to reach him until he wires again,”
Ben answered, “because, unless I am greatly mistaken, he is somewhere
between New Orleans and this point in his airship, the _Ann_.”

“I gathered as much from his messages to Bixby,” replied Mellen.“You
see,” the manager went on, “I got in touch with Havens to-night through
the despatches he sent to Bixby yesterday, I say ‘yesterday’ because it
is now ‘to-morrow’,” he added with a smile.“Then you knew we were here?” asked Ben.“That is,” he corrected
himself, “you knew Bixby was expecting us?”

“When Bixby left you at the hotel,” Mellen laughed, “he came direct to
the telegraph office, so you see I knew all about it before I
burglarized your room.”

“Bixby strikes me as being a very straightforward kind of a man,” Ben
suggested.“I rather like his appearance.”

“He’s all right!” replied Mellen.“And now,” Ben continued, “I’d like to have you remain here a short time
until I can call the other boys and get a general expression of
opinion.”

“Of course you’ll wait for Mr.Havens?” suggested Mellen.“Of course,” answered Ben.“However,” he continued, “I’d like to have
the other members of the party talk this matter over with you.To tell
the truth, I’m all at sea over this suggestion of trouble.”

“I shall be pleased to meet the other members of your party,” replied
Mellen.“I have already heard something of them through my
correspondence with Mr.Havens.”

Ben drew on his clothes and hurried to Glenn’s room.The boy was awake
and opened the door at the first light knock.Ben merely told him to go
to the room where Mr.Mellen had been left and passed on to the
apartment which had been taken by Jimmie and Carl.He knocked softly on the door several times but received no answer.Believing that the boys were sound asleep he tried the door, and to his
great surprise found that it was unlocked.As the reader will understand, he found the room unoccupied.The bed had
not been disturbed except that some of the upper blankets were missing.He hastened back to his own room, where he found Glenn and Mellen
engaged in conversation.Both looked very blank when informed of the
disappearance of Jimmie and Carl.“What do you make of it?” asked Mellen.“I don’t know what to make of it!” replied Glenn.“I think I can explain it!” Ben cried, walking nervously up and down the
room.“Don’t you remember, Glenn,” he went on, “that Jimmie and Carl
suggested the advisability of going back to the old camp after moonrise
and getting the valuable tents, arms and provisions we left there?”

“Sure I remember that!” answered Glenn.“But do you really think they
had the nerve to try a scheme like that?”

“I haven’t the least doubt of it!” declared Ben.“It’s just one of their tricks,” agreed Glenn.“They must be rather lively young fellows!” suggested Mellen.“They certainly are!” answered Ben.“And now the question is this,” he
continued, “what ought we to do?”

“I’m afraid they’ll get into trouble,” Glenn suggested.“It was a foolhardy thing to do!” Mellen declared.“The idea of their
going back into the heart of that savage tribe is certainly
preposterous!I’m afraid they’re already in trouble.”

“Perhaps we ought to get the _Bertha_ and take a trip out there!”
suggested Glenn.“They may be in need of assistance.”

“That’s just my idea!” Ben agreed.“It seems to me that the suggested course is the correct one to pursue,”
Mellen said.“Perhaps we can get to the field before they leave for the valley,” Ben
interposed.“They spoke of going after the moon came up, and that was
only a short time ago.”

“Well,” said Mellen, “the quicker we act the more certain we shall be of
success.You boys get downstairs, if you can, without attracting much
attention, and I’ll go out and get a carriage.”

“Will you go with us to the field?” asked Ben.“I should be glad to,” was the reply.When the boys reached the corner of the next cross street, in ten
minutes’ time, they found Mellen waiting for them with a high-power
automobile.He was already in the seat with the chauffeur.“I captured a machine belonging to a friend of mine,” he said, with a
smile, “and so we shall be able to make quick time.”

As soon as the party came within sight of the field they saw that
something unusual was taking place there, for people were massing from
different parts of the plain to a common center, and people standing in
the highway, evidently about to seek their homes, turned and ran back.“Can you see the flying machines?” asked Ben.“I can see one of them!” answered Mellen in the front seat.“And it
seems to be mounting into the air!”

“I guess the little rascals have got off in spite of us!” declared Ben.“Perhaps we’d better hold up a minute and follow the direction it takes.It may not head for the valley.”

“It’s heading for the valley, all right!” Glenn exclaimed.“Yes, and there’s something going on in the field below,” Mellen
declared.“There are people running about, evidently in great
excitement, and the second machine is being pushed forward.”

“Do you think the little rascals have taken a machine apiece?” demanded
Ben.“There’s no knowing what they will do!”

“No, I don’t,” replied Glenn.“They’d be sure to stick together.”

“Then we’d better hustle up and find who’s taking out the second
machine!” exclaimed Ben.“This does look like trouble, doesn’t it?”

“Oh, it may be all right,” smiled Mellen.“The boys may have taken a
machine apiece.”

When the party reached the field the second flying machine was some
distance away.The driver, however, seemed to be wavering about in the
air as if uncertain of his control of the levers.Once or twice in an
uncertain current of air the _Bertha_ came near dropping to the ground.In time, however, he gained better control.One of the native policemen secured by Bixby rushed up to the automobile
as it came to a stop.He recognized Mellen in the car and addressed him
in Spanish, speaking as if laboring under great excitement.The boys listened to the conversation very impatiently, noting with no
little apprehension the look of anxiety growing on the face of the
manager as he listened to the story of the policeman.At length Mellen
turned to the boys and began translating what he had heard.The story told by the policeman was virtually the story told in the last
chapter, with the exception that it included the departure of Doran and
another in pursuit of the _Louise_.“The policeman,” Mellen went on, “is of the opinion that Doran means
mischief.He declares that he rather forced himself on Bixby, and was
instrumental in securing the absence of the two Englishmen who were to
assist him in guarding the aeroplanes.”

“It seems that the trouble arrived shortly after the Havens’ telegram,”
suggested Ben.“I wish I knew what it meant.”

“No one this side of Kingdom Come knows!” declared Glenn.“That is, no
one save Mr.“Anyway, it’s trouble!”

“How far is it to that valley?” asked Mellen.“At least twenty miles!” replied Ben.“Would it be possible to reach it in this machine?”

“I can’t answer that question,” replied Ben, “because it was dark when
we came over the ground.It seems, however, to be all up hill and down
on the way there.I don’t think the machine could make the trip.”

“I’ve a great notion to try it!” declared Mellen.“Anyway,” he went on,
“we can tour along in that direction.The man in charge of the last
aeroplane doesn’t seem to be next to his job and he may get a tumble.”

“And if he does,” cried Ben, “we’ll give him a lift, patch up the
machine, and start over to the old camp!”

And so, with the two machines in the air, the automobile went roaring
and panting over the rough mountain trails in the direction of the
valley!Occasionally the occupants saw the last machine but not often!“That other machine,” Jimmie observed glancing hastily in the direction
pointed out by Sam, “looks to me like the _Bertha_.”

“Can you identify an aeroplane at that distance in the night-time?”
asked Sam.“I’m sure I couldn’t do anything of the kind!”

“I don’t know as I can express it,” Jimmie replied, “but to me every
flying machine has a method and manner of its own.There is something in
the way an aeroplane carries itself in the sky which reminds me somewhat
of the manner of a man in walking.In the case of the man, you know who
it is long before you can see his face, and in the case of the flying
machine, you know her long before the details of construction are in
view.I’m sure that is the _Bertha_!”

“It is the _Bertha_, all right!” Carl cut in.“And she isn’t being
handled by one of our boys, either!”

“It isn’t possible, is it, that that fellow Doran found the nerve to
chase us up?” asked Jimmie.“If he did, he’s a poor aviator, all right!”

“It’s a wonder to me he doesn’t tip the machine over,” Sam suggested.“He may tip it over yet!” exclaimed Carl.“Just see, how it sways and
sags every time it comes to one of the little currents of air sweeping
out of the gorges.I anticipate a quick tumble there!”

“That’s a nice thing,” exclaimed Jimmie, “for some one to steal the
machine and break it up!If the _Bertha_ goes to pieces now, we’ll have
to delay our trip until another aeroplane can be bought, and the chances
are that we can never buy one as reliable as the _Bertha_.”

“She isn’t smashed yet!” grinned the tramp.“She’s headed straight for
the camp now, and may get here safely.The aviator seems to understand
how to control the levers, but he doesn’t know how to meet air currents.If he had known the country well enough, he might have followed an
almost direct river level to this point.”

“We didn’t know enough to do that!” Carl exclaimed.“We came over
mountains, gorges, and all kinds of dangerous precipices.”

“That was unnecessary,” laughed the tramp, still keeping his eyes fixed
on the slowly-approaching flying machine.“The south branch of the
Esmeraldas river rises in the volcano country somewhere south of Quito.The east branch of the same river rises something like a hundred miles
east and north of Quito.These two branches meet down there in front of
the camp.You can almost see the junction from here.”

“Could a boat sail down either branch of the river?” asked Carl.“I don’t know about that,” was the reply, “but there must be a
continuous valley from Quito to the junction.If yonder aviator had
followed that, or if you had followed it, there would have been no
trouble with gorge winds or gusty drafts circling around mountain tops.”

“Is there a road through the valley?” asked Jimmie.“A wagon road, I
mean.It seems that there ought to be.”

“There are a succession of rough trails used by teamsters,” was the
reply.The trails climb over ridges and
dip down into canyons, but it seems to me that the roadbed is remarkably
smooth.In fact, there seems to be a notion in the minds of the natives
that a very important commercial highway followed the line of the river
a good many centuries ago.I don’t know whether this is correct or not,
but I do know that the highway is virtually unknown to most of the
people living at Quito.I blundered on it by mistake.”

“We’ll go back that way,” Carl suggested, “and, as we can fly low down,
there will be no risk in taking you along with us.”

The flying machine which had been discovered approaching the camp a few
minutes before was now near enough so that two figures could be
distinguished on the seats.The machine was still reeling uncertainly,
the aviator undoubtedly seeking a place to land.“You see,” Carl explained, “the fellow is a stranger so far as this camp
is concerned.If he had ever been here before, he would now know exactly
what to do.Either Ben or Glenn could lay the machine within six inches
of the _Louise_ without half trying.”

“Then you are certain that it is not one of your friends in control of
the aeroplane?” asked Sam.“I am sure of that!” replied Jimmie.“Neither one of the boys would
handle a machine the way that one is being handled.”

“When she gets a little nearer we can tell whether that man Doran is on
board or not,” suggested Carl rather anxiously.“If you are certain that the machine has been stolen from the field
where she was left,” Sam went on, “you ought to decide without delay
what course to take when she lands.The man having her in charge may
have followed you here with hostile intentions.”

“That’s very true!” Carl agreed.“We have two automatics apiece,” Jimmie grinned, “and we know how to use
them, so we’ll be able to take care of ourselves, whatever happens!”

“And I have two which I found lying with the provision packages in one
of the tents,” said Sam.“Perhaps I shall be able now to pay for my
dinner.I’m always glad to do that whenever I can.”

The oncoming machine was now circling over the valley, and it seemed
that a landing would be made in a few minutes.The boys moved back to
where the _Louise_ lay, then stood waiting and watching anxiously.“Do you think the men on the machine saw you?” asked Jimmie, in a
moment, turning to Sam.“It doesn’t seem possible that they did!”

“Certainly not!” answered Sam.“You must remember that it is dark down
here, and that they are virtually looking into a black hole in the
hills.Only for the
remnants of the fire, I don’t believe they could have found the valley
at all!”

“Perhaps they haven’t seen us, either!” Carl suggested.“I don’t think they have,” Sam answered.“Then I’ll tell you what we’ll do!” Jimmie exclaimed.“We’ll scatter and
hide in three different places, in three different directions.Then,
when they land, we’ll perform the Jesse James act and order them to
throw up their hands!With six automatics pointing in their direction,
they’ll probably obey orders without argument.”

“I should think they would!” laughed Carl.“What’s the idea after that?” Sam questioned.“I don’t know,” Jimmie returned.“Anyway, we’ll get the machine and
leave them to walk back to Quito.By the time they have accomplished
that stunt, we’ll be on our way to the haunted temples of Peru.I’m
getting sick of this old country, anyway.”

Bending low in the darkness so as to avoid being seen from above, the
three scattered, in accordance with this arrangement, and lay, securely
hidden, in the tall grass when the _Bertha_ came wavering down.Owing to
the inexperience of the aviator, she struck the earth with a good deal
of a bump, and exclamations of rage were heard from the seats when the
motors were switched into silence.“This must be the place,” Jimmie heard one of the men saying, as the two
leaped to the ground.“There’s been a fire here not long ago, and there
are the tents, just as described by the boys.”

“Yes,” another voice said, “and there is the _Louise_ back in the
shadows.It’s a wonder we didn’t see her before.”

“But where are the boys?” the first speaker said.“We don’t care where the boys are,” a voice which Jimmie recognized as
that of Doran exclaimed.“The boys can do nothing without these
machines.It seems a pity to break them up.”

“We won’t break them up until we have to!” the other declared.“I was thinking of that,” Doran answered.“Suppose we pack up the tents
and provisions and such other things as we can use and take everything
away into some valley where we can hide the machines and all the rest
until this little excitement blows over.”

“That’s just the idea!” the other answered.“When things quiet down a
little we can get a good big price for these machines.”

“And in the meantime,” Doran continued, “we’ll have to catch the boys if
they interfere with our work.If they don’t, we’ll just pack up the
stuff and fly away in the machines.”

“And the two lads at Quito?” asked the other.“Oh,” Doran replied with a coarse laugh, “it will take them three or
four days to find out where their friends are, and a couple of weeks
more to get new machines, and by that time everything will be all lovely
down in Peru.It seems to be working out all right!”

Jimmie felt the touch of a hand upon his shoulder and in a moment, Carl
whispered in his ear:

“Do you mind the beautiful little plans they’re laying?” the boy asked.“Cunning little plans, so far as we’re concerned!” whispered Jimmie.“What do they mean by everything being lovely down in Peru after a
couple of weeks?” asked Carl.“That sounds mysterious!”

“You may search me!” answered Jimmie.“It looks to me, though, as if the
trouble started here might be merely the advance agent of the trouble
supposed to exist across the Peruvian boundary.”

“I suppose,” Carl went on, “that we’re going to lie right here and let
them pack up our stuff and fly away in our machines?”

“Yes, we are!” replied Jimmie.“What we’re going to do is to give those
fellows a little healthy exercise walking back to Quito.”

Directly Doran and his companion found a few sticks of dry wood which
had been brought in by the boys and began building up the fire, for the
double purpose of warmth and light.Then they both began tumbling the
tinned goods out of the tents and rolling the blankets which the boys
had used for bedding.“Ain’t it about time to call a halt?” asked Jimmie.“It certainly is!” Carl answered.“I wonder where our friend Sam is by
this time?He wouldn’t light out and leave us, would he?”

“I don’t think he would,” was the reply.“I have a notion that this
mix-up is just about to his taste!”

Just as Jimmie was about to show himself, revolvers in hand, preparatory
to sailing away in the machines and leaving the intruders with their
hands held well up, a murmur which seemed to come from a myriad of human
voices vibrated on the air and the tall grass all about the place where
the tents had been pitched seemed to be imbued with life.“Savages!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Gee!” whispered Carl, excitedly.“This location seems to be attracting
attention to-night!What are we going to do?”

“If those outlaws were away,” explained Jimmie, “we’d know well enough
what we ought to do!We’d make a rush for the machines and get aboard,
just as we did before.”

“I wonder if Doran and his companion will have sense enough to try
that?” asked Carl.“If they do, we’ll have to stop them, for we can’t
lose the machines.They ought to be shot, anyway.”

While the boys whispered together the savages, evidently in large
numbers, crept toward the aeroplanes in an ever-narrowing circle.As
luck would have it, the place where Jimmie and Carl were hidden was
permitted by the savages to make a break in the circle because of the
depression in which they lay, their heads on a level with the surface of
the earth.The savages swept almost over them, and in a moment, by lifting their
heads above the grass in the rear of the dusky line, they saw the
attacking party swarming around the tents and the machines.Doran and
his companion were seized, disarmed, and tied up with stout fiber woven
from the bark of a tree.Directly a scouting party brought Sam into the
group.The tramp had apparently surrendered without any attempt at defence, and
the boys wondered a little at that until they found themselves facing
lithe spears which waved significantly to and fro within six inches of
their heads!Then they, too, laid down their automatics, for they
understood very well that there was horrible death in the poisoned
shafts.They, too, were marched to the center of the group, now gathered about
the machines.Doran and his companion gazed at them with terror showing
in their faces, and the tramp seemed to consider the situation as too
serious for comment.He moved closer to the two boys, but was almost
immediately forced back by the savages.In a moment the war chants and ejaculations of victory died out while
two savages who seemed to be in charge of the party spoke together.During this silence, tense with excitement, the distant chug, chug, chug
of motors beat the air.The boys looked aloft for an aeroplane, yet did
not understand how one could possibly be there!The savages heard the clamor of the motors, too, and turned quick faces
of alarm toward their white prisoners, as if they alone could explain
what was coming to pass.Doran and his companion, also, turned
questioning glances toward the two boys, while a slow smile of
comprehension flitted over the face of the tramp.As the welcome sounds came nearer the savages gathered closer and moved
a short distance toward the thicket, their spears extended as if to
repel attack.“Do you know what that is?” he asked with a positive grin.“Sounds like an aeroplane!” suggested Jimmie.“Or like an automobile!” Carl put in.“Aw, how could an automobile get up here?” demanded Jimmie.“Don’t you remember the river road Sam was telling us about not long
ago?” asked Carl.“I guess an automobile could run along that, all
right!”

“Is that so?” asked Jimmie turning to Sam.“A superior machine driven by a superior chauffeur might,” was the
reply.“Anyway, that’s a motor-car coming, and there’s no other way to
get in here.We’ll see the lights in a moment.”

“Gee!” Jimmie exclaimed.“Do you think our friends chased the men who
stole the _Bertha_ up in a high-power automobile?”

“That’s just what I do think!” exclaimed Carl.“And that is undoubtedly the fact,” Sam agreed.Doran and his companion seemed to share in the pleasant anticipations
the boys were now sensing, for they approached them in a friendly manner
and began asking questions regarding the oncoming machine.The savages were still drawing farther away, and Sam occupied his time
during the next moment in finding his way back to the tents and
procuring another automatic revolver which had not been discovered by
the outlaws.He held it so that the two boys caught sight of the brown
barrel and nodded significantly toward Doran and his friend.“He doesn’t mean to let them get away,” said Jimmie to Carl, in a low
aside.“He seems to be next to his job!”

The savages, with their eyes fixed upon the jungle near the river bank,
kept crowding farther away from the machines.The clamor of the motors
came louder every instant, and directly two powerful acetylene lamps
looked out of the tall grass like great blazing eyes.The savages no longer hesitated as to how to meet this new situation.They dropped their spears and whatever else they had in their hands and
broke for the thicket, uttering such cries of fright and terror as the
boys had never imagined could issue forth from human lips.Doran and his
companion sprang for the machines as the savages disappeared.When Ben, Glenn and Mellen came bumping up in the automobile, a minute
later, they saw the two fellows standing by the side of the _Louise_
with their hands held high in the air.Before them stood Sam with a
threatening revolver pushed to within six inches of their faces.“Jerusalem!” exclaimed Ben, springing from the machine.“This looks like
a scene in one of the fierce old dramas they used to put on at the
Bowery theater!Are those the men who stole the _Bertha_?” he added
nodding toward the two whose arms were still held out.“They came here in the _Bertha_!” replied Carl.Mellen,” began Doran, “you know me well enough to know that I
wouldn’t get mixed up in any such thieving scrape!These two boys came
to the field and ran away with the _Louise_.I had orders not to let any
one take the machines away, so I followed them in the _Bertha_.”

“And he merely employed me to go with him!” the other fellow cut in.“They stole the machine!” insisted Jimmie.“I heard them talking about
leaving us here to walk back to Quito and hiding the machines in some
mountain valley until the search for them had died out.They were even
packing up our provisions and tents to take with them when the savages
came up!”

“So those were savages who took to the tall timber?” asked Glenn.“The same kind of people who drove us out of the valley,” answered
Jimmie.“They had the whole bunch pinched when your machine came dancing
merrily out of the woods!”

“And the way the <DW65>s took to the tall timber was a caution!”
exclaimed Carl.“They must be going yet!”

“Mr.Mellen,” broke in Doran, “I insist on being released from this
ridiculous position.I ask you to order this tramp to remove his
revolver.I am not used to such indignities.”

“He is not subject to my orders,” replied Mellen.The tramp looked at Doran with a humorous smile on his face.“I don’t understand,” he said, “how you managed to reach this place in a
road machine.It must have been awful going!”

“It certainly was!” answered Mellen.“Many a time I thought the machine
incapable of making the grades, and on various occasions we nearly
dropped over precipices.”

“I never was so scared in my life!” declared Ben.“Riding an aeroplane is a picture of peace and safety in comparison to
such a whirl as that!” declared Glenn.“I hung on with my toes most of
the way!And,” he added, with a grin, “I saw Ben getting ready to jump
several times.”

“We went so fast I couldn’t jump!” declared Ben.“I must congratulate you on the trip,” Sam cut in in a manner intended
to be friendly.“I don’t think any motor-car ever passed over that river
trail before!You certainly have blazed the way for others!”

“Tell it to the chauffeur!” laughed Mellen.“And now, boys,” he went on,
“seeing you have rescued your precious oiled-silk shelter-tents, we may
as well be getting back to the city.”

“I want to travel back in the _Bertha_!” exclaimed Ben.“And so do I!” Glenn cut in.“No more of that river ride for me!”

“That leaves me to the full command of the motor-car!” laughed Mellen.“I think one of you boys, at least, might ride back with me.”

“Why, if the boys take the machines,” Doran put in, “there’s nothing for
us to do but ride back in the motor-car.”

“You’ll walk so far as I’m concerned!” exclaimed Mellen.“Then I’ll act as first mate of the roadster,” suggested Sam, whereat
Mellen looked at the boys inquiringly.“He’s all right!” Jimmie exclaimed.“We found him here acting as
custodian of the camp,” he continued with a grin.“And you can see for
yourself how he pinched these two thieves.”

“Be careful boy!” almost shouted Doran.“You’ll have to answer for every
word you say against me!”

“I said ‘thieves’!” insisted Jimmie.“I overheard what you said before
the savages came up.You were going to make us walk back to Quito, and
now we’ll give you a dose of your own medicine.You’re the rascals
that’ll do the walking.”

Mellen called the boys aside and, after learning exactly what had taken
place, both at the field and at the camp, fully agreed that the men
ought to be obliged to walk back to Quito.“It will teach them a lesson,” he said, “and, besides, it will keep them
out of mischief for at least twenty-four hours!”

“Now,” Ben said, “Jimmie and I will go back in the _Louise_, and Glenn
and Carl can take the _Bertha_.Mellen, and Sam can return in
the automobile, and we’ll fly just above you along the river trail.If
you tumble over a precipice,” he added, with a smile, “we may be able to
pick you up, or you may be able to help us!”

“There is one thing about it,” Carl suggested, “and that is that we
won’t have to use the flying machines for freight wagons.The automobile
can carry the tents and provisions and everything of that sort back to
Quito.That will make it easier for us to duck about and watch the
course of the automobile.You may need watching, you know,” he added
turning to Mellen.“Especially,” he continued, “if you have Sam Weller
with you!”

The boys mounted the machines and were soon in the air, while Mellen and
Sam entered the motor-car, the latter keeping Doran and his companion
covered with an automatic revolver until the car was ready to start.Both men sprang forward as the wheels began to revolve.“Are you really going away and leave us to walk to Quito?” demanded
Doran.“The savages will be here in an hour after you leave!”

This was an argument which Mellen could not resist.It was perfectly
clear that the men would be murdered by the Indians if left there alone.“Perhaps,” he said, after some hesitation, “we’d better carry you far
enough to get you out of the Indian country.”

“Only five miles!” pleaded Doran.“Jump in!” replied the manager.The two men thanked Mellen effusively, but there was a crafty, scheming
look in Doran’s eyes which told plainly enough that he intended to take
advantage of the kindness of the manager at the very first opportunity.Sam saw the evil expression and placed the automatic within easy reach
of his hand.Doran saw the movement and snarled out an oath.“There’s no need for you to make any gun-play!” he scowled.“When I see a snake,” declared Sam, “I don’t take any chances on being
bitten!I know pretty well the kind of a sneak you are.”

“Look here!” exclaimed Doran, appealing to Mellen, “why don’t you take
us back to Quito and make complaint against us for stealing the machine?It seems to me that that is the correct thing for you to do!”

Mellen considered this proposition gravely for a moment.He believed now
that Doran was in some way mixed up in a conspiracy against the boys.Havens’ telegrams to Ben and
himself, the actions of the two men seemed significant.In fact, the
manager believed that the trouble referred to in Mr.Havens’ messages
had already made its appearance, guided by the hand of Doran!It seemed to him that the man’s plea was entirely reasonable, and yet he
understood that the fellows ought to be kept out of Quito as long as
possible.Even in jail, held only on a charge of grand larceny, Doran
would have little difficulty in securing a lawyer and communicating with
such other desperadoes as might be concerned in the conspiracy.“The savages,” Doran went on, pleadingly, “are scattered all through
this country, from the Colombia boundary line to Peru.It would be plain
murder to leave us here at this time!”

“I half believe the man is right!” Sam agreed.“You know I am right!” insisted Doran.The matter was one which Mellen hesitated to decide.He believed that,
by taking Doran to Quito, he would place the boys in some unknown peril;
and he believed, too, that by leaving the two men in the mountains he
might be contributing to their murder.“What do you think about it?” he asked, turning to Sam.“I wouldn’t turn a thieving dog over to those savages!” was the reply.“No civilized human being would!” Doran exclaimed.“Very well,” Mellen replied.“I’ll take you to the police office at
Quito and ask to have you locked up on a charge of grand larceny.”

“That will be satisfactory,” answered Doran.While entirely satisfied with the decision which had been reached, both
Mellen and Sam did not fully trust the two prisoners.They believed that
at some time during the return trip an attempt at escape would be made.The two pretended to be very much interested in the aeroplanes, which
were almost constantly in sight, yet Mellen saw that they inspected the
trail eagerly as if looking for some soft place to land.Believing that the men would attempt to leave the motor-car only when
within a short distance of Quito, the two did not watch them as closely
as they might have done.The attempt came when the car had covered only
about half the distance between the camp and the city.The chauffeur was coasting down a very steep declivity with the brakes
well in hand and Mellen and Sam were clinging tightly to the sides of
the machine when Doran sprang to his feet and leaped.His companion attempted to follow his example, but Sam’s hand was laid
upon his shoulder at that instant, and the two tumbled into the bottom
of the car.The struggle there was of short duration, for Sam was a
muscular fellow and the other combatant was not inclined to put up much
of a fight.It was impossible to stop the car on the steep grade, and so Mellen and
Sam were obliged to remain inactive while Doran struggled to his feet
and shook his fist at the car uttering as he did so threats of
vengeance.A FINE CURTAIN-RAISER.The sun was rising over the mountains when the flying machines and the
motor-car reached the field where the boys had landed the night before.After the escape of Doran, the aeroplanes had searched the hills and
gorges for the fugitive, but had found no trace of him observable from
the sky.After seeing that the machines were placed in charge of capable and
loyal officers, the boys entered the car with Mellen and were driven to
the hotel.When they reached the entrance they found a little crowd
assembled in the lobby.Messengers from the telegraph office were passing out and in, and the
clerk seemed to be answering a good many questions by ’phone.Mellen
stopped at the office counter while the boys took the elevator for their
rooms unobserved by the clerk in the office.“There’s something strange going on here!” the clerk exclaimed, as Mr.“We have a sheaf of telegrams for you, and a lot more
for those boys who came here last night.”

“Well,” smiled the manager, “you may as well deliver them.”

“Deliver them?” repeated the clerk.“How are we going to deliver them?You can receipt now for the ones which belong to you,” he went on, “but
what are we going to do with those directed to the boys?”

“Why, deliver them!” answered Mellen.“But the boys left the hotel last night!” replied the clerk angrily.“Without paying their bills!”

“But they are in their rooms now,” Mellen assured the clerk.“And they stole woolen blankets off the bed, too!” the clerk almost
shouted.“I ought to have them all arrested!”

As the clerk uttered the words in a loud tone a slender, black-eyed man
who seemed to Mellen to move about the corridor with the sinuous
undulations of a snake, stepped up to the desk.“So the fugitives have returned?” he asked.“Shall I arrest them at
once?You have made the charge, you know!”

“You will find the blankets in the boys’ room,” advised Mellen.“They
took them because they had a long, cold ride before them.”

“It is policy to restore stolen goods after discovery!” snarled the man
who had asked instructions of the clerk, and who occupied the very
honorable position of house detective.“Look here, Gomez!” exclaimed Mellen.The boys
had a right to use the blankets outside of the hotel as well as inside.”

“I shall do as the clerk says!” snarled the detective.“Oh, I suppose we’ll have to let it go if they’ve brought the blankets
back!” replied the clerk, reluctantly.Gomez turned away with a sullen frown on his face, and Mellen saw that
he had made an enemy of the fellow.“These boys are your friends?” asked the clerk of Mellen.“I never saw them until last night,” was the reply, “but I know that
they belong to the party of which Louis Havens, the millionaire aviator,
is the head.I presume the telegrams waiting for me here are from Mr.Havens, who expects to be here within twenty-four hours.”

“Not Louis Havens, the great explorer?” asked the clerk.“The same,” answered Mellen, “and if you’ve anything more to say about
the boys, say it to him.”

Taking the telegrams from the clerk, Mellen went back to the machine
and, after leaving the prisoner with the police, hastened to Ben’s room,
where the other boys were assembled.As he had supposed, the messages
were all from Mr.Havens, and all were repetitions of the warning which
had been sent the previous night.“I don’t understand what it means!” Ben said after the messages had been
read and discussed.“But it is a sure thing that Mr.Havens knows what
he is talking about.”

“I think we’d all better go and get a square meal and go to bed!” Jimmie
observed, rubbing his eyes.“The next time I get up in the night to take
a twenty-mile ride in the air, I won’t.”

“That’s very good sense,” Mellen agreed.“These telegrams, as you see,
state that Mr.Havens cannot possibly reach Quito until some time
to-night.”

“Then we can have a good sleep!” Carl agreed.“And sit up all night
again if we want to.”

“It hasn’t been such a bad night!” Ben observed.“If we had only kept
Doran, everything would be in pretty good shape now.”

“What did the chief of police say when you turned the other gink over to
him?” asked Carl.“He locked him up, didn’t he?”

“Yes, he locked him up!” answered Mellen.“But, before I left the
station, I saw the fellow at the ’phone and I presume he is out on bail
by this time.The police have no recourse if bail is offered.”

“Then I’ll tell you what you do!” advised Ben.“If he is admitted to
bail, you hire a private detective and have him watched.He is sure to
meet with Doran before very long.He may go to the hills to consult with
him, or Doran may come to the city, but the two fellows are certain to
come together!Then Doran can be arrested.”

“That’s a good idea,” Mellen answered, “and I’ll attend to the matter as
soon as I get back to my office.Now, we’ll all go down to a restaurant
and have breakfast.I’m hungry myself just now.”

“What’s the matter with the hotel?” asked Ben.Mellen did not care to explain to the boys exactly what had taken place
down stairs, but he felt that they would be treated with suspicion as
long as they remained there, so he decided to ask them to change their
quarters as soon as they returned from breakfast.Making the reply that the morning _table d’hote_ at the hotel was not
suitable for hungry boys who had been up all night, Mellen went with the
lads to a first-class restaurant.After breakfast he suggested a change
of hotels, saying only that they had already attracted too much
attention at the one where they were stopping, and the boys agreed
without argument.It took only a short time to locate in the new
quarters, and the boys were soon sound asleep.When Ben awoke, some one was knocking at his door, and directly he heard
a low chuckle which betrayed the presence of Jimmie in the corridor.“Get a move on!” the latter shouted.“What’s up?” asked Ben.“Time’s up!” replied Jimmie.“Open up!” almost yelled Carl.Ben sprang out of bed, half-dressed himself, and opened the door.The
first face he saw was that of Mr.Havens, who looked dusty and tired as
if from a long journey.As may be imagined, the greetings between the two were very cordial.In
a moment the boys all flocked into Ben’s room, where Mr.Havens was
advised to freshen up in the bath before entering upon the business in
hand.“You must have had a merry old time with the _Ann_,” laughed Ben.“Never saw anything like it!” exclaimed Mr.“Did she break down?”

“Half a dozen times!”

“Perhaps there was some good reason for it,” suggested Glenn,
significantly.“Indeed there was!” answered Mr.“Couldn’t you catch him?” asked Jimmie.“I could not!” was the reply.While the millionaire remained in the bath-room, the boys discussed all
manner of surmises concerning the accidents which had happened to the
_Ann_.They had not yet heard a word of explanation from Mr.Havens
concerning the warnings of trouble which had been received by wire, but
they understood that the interferences to the big aeroplane were only
part of the general trouble scheme which seemed to have broken loose the
night before.“We don’t know anything about it!” exclaimed Jimmie.“And we won’t know
anything about it until Mr.Havens gets cleaned up and tells us, so we
may as well talk about hens, or white bulldogs, until he gets ready to
open up.By the way,” the boy continued, “where is Sam?”

“Mellen took him down to get him into decent clothes,” Ben answered.“Is he coming back here?” asked Jimmie.“I rather like that fellow.”

“Of course he’s coming back!” Ben replied.“He’s hasn’t got any other
place to go!He’s flat broke and hungry.”

“I thought perhaps he wouldn’t like to meet Mr.Havens,” Jimmie
commented, with a wink at Carl.“And why not?” asked Ben, somewhat amazed.Then the story of Sam Weller’s previous employment at the hangar on Long
Island came out.The boys all declared that they wanted to be present
when Sam met his former employer!“I don’t care what you say about Sam!” Jimmie declared, after the boys
had finished their discussion of the Long Island incident.“I like him
just the same!There’s a kind of a free and easy impudence about him
that gets me.I hope he’ll stay with us!”

“He might ride with Mr.Havens in the _Ann_!” laughed Carl.“Well, I don’t believe Mr.Havens would object, at that!” declared
Jimmie.“Certainly he wouldn’t object!” replied the millionaire, coming out of
the bath-room door with a smile on his face.“And so Sam Weller showed
up here, did he?” he asked as he seated himself.“The boy is a
first-class aviator, but he used to get his little finger up above his
nose too often, so I had to let him go.Did he tell any of you boys how
he happened to drift into this section?”

“He told me,” Jimmie replied, “that he was making a leisurely trip from
the Isthmus of Panama to Cape Horn.He looked the part, too, for I guess
he hadn’t had a square meal for several decades, and his clothes looked
as if they had been collected out of a rag-bag!”

“He’s a resourceful chap!” Mr.“He’s a first-class
aviator, as I said, in every way, except that he is not dependable, and
that of course spoils everything.”

“He’s got the nerve!” Carl observed.“He certainly has!” agreed Jimmie.Havens said in a moment, “if you boys like Sam, we’ll take
him along.We have room for one more in the party.”

“And that brings us down to business!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Right here,”
he went on, “is where we want you to turn on the spot light.We’ve had
so many telegrams referring to trouble that we’re beginning to think
that Trouble is our middle name!”

“Perhaps we would better wait until Mellen and Sam return,” suggested
Mr.“That will save telling the story two or three times.”

“Is Sam Weller really his name?” asked Jimmie.“I don’t think so,” answered Havens.“I think it is merely a name he
selected out of the Pickwick Papers.While in my employ on Long Island
several people who knew him by another name called to visit with him.Now and then I questioned these visitors, but secured little
information.”

“Perhaps he’s a Pittsburg Millionaire or a Grand Duke in disguise!”
suggested Carl.“And again,” the boy went on, “he may be merely the
black sheep in some very fine family.”

“There’s something a little strange about the boy,” Mr.Havens agreed,
“but I have never felt myself called upon to examine into his
antecedents.”

“Here he comes now!” cried Carl.“With a new suit of clothes on his back
and a smile lying like a benediction all over his clean shave!”

The boys were glad to see that the millionaire greeted Sam as an old
friend.For his part, Sam extended his hand to his former employer and
answered questions as if he had left his employ with strong personal
letters of recommendation to every crowned head in the world!“And now for the story,” Mellen said after all were seated.“And when you speak of trouble,” Jimmie broke in, “always spell it with
a big ‘T’, for that’s the way it opened out on us!”

“I’m going to begin right at the beginning,” Mr.Havens said, with a
smile, “and the beginning begins two years ago.”

“Gee!” exclaimed Jimmie.“That’s a long time for trouble to lie in wait
before jumping out at a fellow!”

“In fact,” Mr.Havens went on, “the case we have now been dumped into,
heels over head, started in New York City two years ago, when Milo
Redfern, cashier of the Invincible Trust Company, left the city with a
half million dollars belonging to the depositors.”

“That’s a good curtain lifter!” exclaimed Carl.“When you open a drama
with a thief and a half million dollars, you’ve started something!”




                               CHAPTER X.

                        WHERE THE TROUBLE BEGAN.“When Redfern disappeared,” Mr.Havens went on, “we employed the best
detective talent in America to discover his whereabouts and bring him
back.The best detective talent in America failed.”

“That ain’t the way they put it in stories!” Carl cut in.“We spent over a hundred thousand dollars trying to bring the thief to
punishment, and all we had to show for this expenditure at the end of
the year was a badly spelled letter written—at least mailed—on the lower
East Side in New York, conveying the information that Redfern was hiding
somewhere in the mountains of Peru.”

“There you go!” exclaimed Ben.“The last time we went out on a little
excursion through the atmosphere, we got mixed up with a New York murder
case, and also with Chinese smugglers, and now it seems that we’ve got
an embezzlement case to handle.”

“Embezzlement case looks good to me!” shouted Jimmie.“Hiding in the mountains of Peru?” repeated Sam.“Now I wonder if a man
hiding in the mountains of Peru has loyal friends or well-paid agents in
the city of Quito.”

“There!” exclaimed Mr.“Sam has hit the nail on the head the
first crack.I never even told the boys when they left New York that
they were bound for Peru on a mission in which I was greatly interested.I thought that perhaps they would get along better and have a merrier
time if they were not loaded down with official business.”

“That wouldn’t have made any difference!” announced Carl.“We’d have
gone right along having as much fun as if we were in our right minds!”

“When I started away from the hangar in the _Ann_,” Mr.Havens
continued, with a smile at the interruption, “I soon saw that some one
in New York was interested in my remaining away from Peru.”

“Redfern’s friends of course!” suggested Mellen.“Exactly!” replied the millionaire.“And Redfern’s friends appeared on the scene last night, too,” Jimmie
decided.“And they managed to make quite a hit on their first
appearance, too,” he continued.“And this man Doran is at present ready
for another engagement if you please.He’s a foxy chap!”

“I’m sorry he got away!” Mellen observed.“Yes, it’s too bad,” Mr.Havens agreed, “but, in any event, we couldn’t
have kept him in prison here isolated from his friends.”

“There’s one good thing about it,” Ben observed, “and that is that we’ve
already set a trap to catch him.”

“How’s that?” asked the millionaire.Mellen has employed a detective to follow Doran’s companion on the
theory that sometime, somewhere, the two will get together again.”

“That’s a very good idea!” Mr.“Now about this man Redfern,” Mr.“Is he believed to be
still in the mountains of Peru?”

“I have at least one very good reason for supposing so,” answered the
millionaire.“Yes, I think he is still there.”

“Give us the good reason!” exclaimed Carl.“I guess we want to know how
to size things up as we go along!”

“The very good reason is this,” replied Mr.Havens with a smile, “the
minute we started in our airships for the mountains of Peru, obstacles
began to gather in our way.The friends or accomplices of Redfern began
to flutter the instant we headed toward Peru.”

“That strikes me as being a good and sufficient reason for believing
that he is still there!” Mellen commented.“Yes, I think it is!” replied the millionaire.“And it is an especially
good reason,” he went on, “when you understand that all our previous
plans and schemes for Redfern’s capture have never evoked the slightest
resistance.”

“Then the embezzler is in Peru, all right, all right!” laughed Carl.“But Peru is a very large country,” suggested Mr.“There’s a good deal of land in the country,” agreed Jimmie.“When you
come to measure the soil that stands up on end, I guess you’d find Peru
about as large as the United States of America!”

“What are the prospects?” asked Mellen.“What I mean,” he continued, “is
this: Can you put your finger on any one spot on the map of Peru and
say—look there first for Redfern.”

“Yes,” replied Mr.Havens, “I think I can.If you ask me to do it, I’ll
just cover Lake Titicaca with my thumb and tell you to pull Redfern out
of the water as soon as you get to that part of old Incaland!”

“Je-rusalem!” exclaimed Jimmie.“And that takes us right down to the
haunted temple!”

“What kind of a lake is this Titicaca?” asked Glenn.“Don’t you ever read anything except base-ball stories and police court
records?” asked Ben, turning to his friend.“Before I was seven years
old I knew that Lake Titicaca is larger than Lake Erie; that it is five
inches higher in the summer than in the winter, and that the longer you
keep a piece of iron or steel in it the brighter it will become.”

“Is it a fact that the waters of this lake do not rust metal?” asked
Mellen.“That seems to me to be a peculiar circumstance.”

“I have often heard it stated as a fact,” replied Mr.“Ask any one who knows, if you won’t believe me,” Ben went on with a
provoking smile.“It is said that Lake Titicaca represents the oldest
civilization in the world.There are temples built of stones larger than
those used in the pyramids of Egypt.The stones have remained in
position after a century because of the nicety with which they are
fitted together.It is said to be impossible to drive the finest needle
between the seams of the walls composed of granite rocks.”

“But what did they want to build such temples and fortresses for?”
demanded Jimmie.“Why didn’t they spend more time playing base-ball?”

“You’re a nut on base-ball!” laughed Ben.“The temples which exist to-day were there when the Incas settled the
country,” the boy continued.“They knew no more of their origin than we
do at this time!”

“They may be a million years old!” exclaimed Carl.“Perhaps that’s as good a guess as any,” replied Ben.“We don’t know how
old they are, and never shall know.”

“Isn’t it a little remarkable,” said Mellen, “that an act of
embezzlement committed in New York City more than two years ago should
lead to a visit to ruined temples in Peru?”

“Now about this Lake Titicaca, about which Ben has given us a bit of
history,” Mr.Havens said, after replying briefly to Mellen’s question.“We have every reason to believe that Redfern has been living in some of
the ancient structures bordering the lake.”

“Did you ever try to unearth the East Side person who wrote the letter
you have just referred to?” asked Ben.“We have spent thousands of dollars in quest of that person,” replied
the millionaire, “and all to no purpose.”

“And what do we do to-morrow?” asked Jimmie, breaking into the
conversation in true boy-fashion.“Why, we’re going to start for Peru!” cried Carl.“And the haunted temples!” laughed Ben.“Honest, boys,” he went on, “I
don’t believe there’s anything in this haunted temple yarn.There may be
temples which are being guarded from the ravages of the superstitious by
interested persons who occasionally play the ghost, but so far as any
supernatural manifestations are concerned the idea is ridiculous.”

“Don’t you ever say anything like that in the vicinity of Lake
Titicaca,” Mellen suggested.“If you do, the natives will suddenly
discover that you are robbers, bent on plunder, and some night, your
bodies may find a resting-place at the bottom of the lake.”

“Do they really believe the temples to be haunted?” asked Glenn.“There are people in whose interest the superstition is kept up,”
replied Ben.“These interested people would doubtless gladly perform the
stunt just suggested by Mellen.”

“I think I’ve got the combination now!” Jimmie laughed.“See if I’m
right.The temples still hold stores of gold, and those searching for
the treasure are keeping adventurous people away by making the ghost
walk.”

“That’s the idea!” Ben replied.“And, look here!” Sam broke in.“Why shouldn’t this man Redfern have a
choice collection of ghosts of his own?”

“That’s an idea, too,” Mr.“I’ll bet he has!” Jimmie insisted.“Then we’ll examine the homes of the ghosts first,” grinned Jimmie.“We’ll walk up to the portal and say: ‘Mr.Ghost, if you’ll materialize
Redfern, we’ll give you half of the reward offered for him by the trust
company.’ That ought to bring him, don’t you think?”

“And here’s another idea,” Sam interrupted.“If Redfern has ghosts in
the temple in which he is hiding—if he really is hiding in a Peruvian
temple—his ghosts will be the most active ghosts on the job.In other
words, we’ll hear more about his haunted temple than any other haunted
temple in all Peru.His ghosts will be in a constant state of eruption!”

“And that’s another good idea,” suggested Mr.“Oh, Sam is wise all right,” Jimmie went on.“I knew that the minute he
told me about unearthing the provisions in the tent before he knew
whether the savages were coming back!”

“Gentlemen,” began Sam, with one of his smooth smiles, “I was so hungry
that I didn’t much care whether the savages came back or not.It
appeared to me then that the last morsel of food that had passed my lips
had exhausted itself at a period farther away than the birth of Adam!”

“You must have been good and hungry!” laughed Mellen.“What did you wander off into that country for?” asked Jimmie.“You
might have known better.”

“I couldn’t remain in the Canal Zone,” replied Sam, “because no one
would give me a job.Everybody seemed to want to talk to me for my own
good.Even the chief in charge of the Gatun dam contract told me——”

“Do you know the chief in charge of the Gatun dam contract?” asked
Havens, casually.“You spoke of him a moment ago as if you had met him
personally.”

“Well, you see,” Sam went on, hesitatingly, “you see I just happened
to——”

The confusion of the young man was so great that no further questions
were asked of him at that time, but all understood that he had
inadvertently lifted a curtain which revealed previous acquaintance with
men like the chief in charge of the Gatun dam.The boy certainly was a
mystery, and they all decided to learn the truth about him before
parting company.Havens said, breaking a rather oppressive silence, “are we
all ready for the roof of the world to-morrow?”

“You bet we’re all ready!” cried Jimmie.“I’m ready right now!” exclaimed Carl.“Will you go with us, Sam?” asked Mr.“I should be glad to!” was the reply.No more was said on the subject at that time, yet all saw by the
expression on the tramp’s face how grateful he was for this new chance
in life which Mr.“Jerusalem!” exclaimed Jimmie in a moment, jumping to his feet and
rushing toward the door.“I’ve forgotten something!”

“Something important?” asked Ben.I should say so!” replied Jimmie.“I forgot to eat my
dinner, and I haven’t had any supper yet!”

“How did you come to do it?” asked Mellen.“I didn’t wake up!” was the reply.“And now,” the boy went on, “you see
I’ve got to go and eat two meals all at once.”

“I’ll eat one of them for you,” suggested Sam.“And I’ll eat the other!” volunteered Ben.“Yes you will,” grinned Jimmie.“I don’t need any help when it comes to
supplying the region under my belt with provisions.”

The boys hustled away to the dining-room, it being then about seven
o’clock, while Mr.Havens and Mellen hastened back to the manager’s
office.Passing through the public lobby, the manager entered his private room
and opened a sheaf of telegrams lying on the table.He read it carefully, twice
over, and then turned a startled face toward the manager.The manager glanced at the millionaire’s startled face for a moment and
then asked, his voice showing sympathy rather than curiosity:

“Unpleasant news, Mr.Havens?”

“Decidedly so!” was the reply.The millionaire studied over the telegram for a moment and then laid it
down in front of the manager.“Read it!” he said.The message was brief and ran as follows:

  “Ralph Hubbard murdered last night!Private key to deposit box A
  missing from his desk!”

“Except for the information that some one has been murdered,” Mellen
said, restoring the telegram to its owner, “this means little or nothing
to me.I don’t think I ever knew Ralph Hubbard!”

“Ralph Hubbard,” replied the millionaire gravely, “was my private
secretary at the office of the Invincible Trust Company, New York.All
the papers and information collected concerning the search for Milo
Redfern passed through his hands.In fact, the letter purporting to have
been written and mailed on the lower East Side of New York was addressed
to him personally, but in my care.”

“And deposit box A?” asked Mellen.“Pardon me,” he added in a moment, “I
don’t seek to pry into your private affairs, but the passing of the
telegram to me seemed to indicate a desire on your part to take me into
your confidence in this matter.”

“Deposit box A,” replied the millionaire, “contained every particle of
information we possess concerning the whereabouts of Milo Redfern.”

“I see!” replied Mellen.“I see exactly why you consider the murder and
robbery so critically important at this time.”

“I have not only lost my friend,” Mr.Havens declared, “but it seems to
me at this time that I have also lost all chance of bringing Redfern to
punishment.”

“I’m sorry,” consoled Mellen.“I don’t know what to do now,” the millionaire exclaimed.“With the
information contained in deposit box A in their possession, the
associates of Redfern may easily frustrate any move we may make in
Peru.”

“So it seems!” mused Mellen.“But this man Redfern is still a person of
considerable importance!Men who have passed out of the range of human
activities seldom have power to compel the murder of an enemy many
hundreds of miles away.”

“I have always believed,” Mr.Havens continued, “that the money
embezzled by Redfern was largely used in building up an institution
which seeks to rival the Invincible Trust Company.”

“In that case,” the manager declared, “the whole power and influence of
this alleged rival would be directed toward the continued absence from
New York of Redfern.”

“Exactly!” the millionaire answered.“Then why not look in New York first?” asked Mellen.“Until we started away on this trip,” was the reply, “we had nothing to
indicate that the real clew to the mystery lay in New York.”

“Did deposit box A contain papers connecting Redfern’s embezzlement with
any of the officials of the new trust company?” asked the manager.“Certainly!” was the reply.The manager gave a low whistle of amazement and turned to his own
telegrams.The millionaire sat brooding in his chair for a moment and
then left the room.At the door of the building, he met Sam Weller.Havens,” the young man said, drawing the millionaire aside, “I want
permission to use one of your machines for a short time to-night.”

“Granted!” replied Mr.“I’ve got an idea,” Sam continued, “that I can pick up valuable
information between now and morning.I may have to make a long flight,
and so I’d like to take one of the boys with me if you do not object.”

“They’ll all want to go,” suggested the millionaire.“I know that,” laughed Sam, “and they’ve been asleep all day, and will
be prowling around asking questions while I’m getting ready to leave.I
don’t exactly know how I’m going to get rid of them.”

“Which machine do you want?” asked Mr.“The _Ann_, sir, if it’s all the same to you.”

“You’re quite welcome to her,” the millionaire returned.“Well, then, with your permission,” continued Sam, “I’ll smuggle Jimmie
out to the field and we’ll be on our way.The machine has plenty of
gasoline on board, I take it, and is perfect in other ways?”

“I believe her to be in perfect condition, and well supplied with fuel,”
was the answer.“She’s the fastest machine in the world right now.”

Sam started away, looking anything but a tramp in his new clothes, but
turned back in a moment and faced his employer.“If we shouldn’t be back by morning,” he said, then, “don’t do any
worrying on our account.Start south in your machines and you’ll be
certain to pick us up somewhere between Quito and Lake Titicaca.If you
don’t pick us up within a day or two,” the boy continued in a hesitating
tone, “you’ll find a letter addressed to yourself at the local
post-office.”

“Look here, Sam,” suggested Mr.Havens, “why don’t you tell me a little
more about yourself and your people?”

“Sometime, perhaps, but not now,” was the reply.“The letter, you
understand,” he continued, “is not to be opened until you have
reasonable proof of my death.”

“I understand!” the millionaire answered.“But here’s another thing,” he
added, “you say that we may find you between Quito and Lake Titicaca.Are you acquainted with that region?”

“Well, I know something about it!” replied Sam.“You see,” he continued,
“when I left your employ in the disgraceful manner which will at once
occur to you, I explained to Old Civilization that she might go and hang
herself for all of me.I ducked into the wilderness, and since that time
I’ve spent many weeks along what is known as the roof of the world in
Peru.”

“I wish you luck in your undertaking!” Mr.Havens said as the young man
turned away, “and the only advice I give you at parting is that you take
good care of yourself and Jimmie and enter upon no unnecessary risks!”

“That’s good advice, too!” smiled Sam, and the two parted with a warm
clasp of the hands.After leaving the millionaire aviator at the telegraph office, Sam
hastened to the hotel where the boys were quartered and called Jimmie
out of the little group in Ben’s room.They talked for some moments in
the corridor, and then Jimmie thrust his head in at the half-open door
long enough to announce that he was going out with Sam to view the city.The boys were all on their feet in an instant.“Me, too!” shouted Ben.“You can’t lose me!” cried Carl.Glenn was at the door ready for departure with the others.“No, no!” said Sam shaking his head.“Jimmie and I are just going out
for a little stroll.Unfortunately I can take only one person besides
myself into some of the places where I am going.”

The boys shut the door with a bang, leaving Carl on the outside.The lad
turned the knob of the door and opened and closed it to give the
impression that he, too, had returned to the apartment.Then he moved
softly down the corridor and, still keeping out of sight, followed Sam
and Jimmie out in the direction of the field where the machines had been
left.The two conversed eagerly, sometimes excitedly during the walk, but of
course, Carl could hear nothing of what was being said.There was quite
a crowd assembled around the machines, and so Carl had little difficulty
in keeping out of sight as he stepped close to the _Ann_.After talking
for a moment or two with one of the officers in charge of the machines,
Sam and Jimmie leaped into the seats and pushed the starter.As they did so Jimmie felt a clutch at his shoulders, and then a light
body settled itself in the rather large seat beside him.“You thought you’d get away, didn’t you?” grinned Carl.“Look here!” shouted Jimmie as the powerful machine swept across the
field and lifted into the air, “you can’t go with us!”

“Oh, I can’t?” mocked Carl.“I don’t know how you’re going to put me
off!You don’t want to stop the machine now, of course!”

“But, see here!” insisted Jimmie, “we’re going on a dangerous mission!We’re likely to butt into all kinds of trouble.And, besides,” he
continued, “Sam has provisions for only two.You’ll have to go hungry if
you travel with us.We’ve only five or six meals with us!”

“So you’re planning a long trip, eh?” scoffed Carl.“What will the boys
say about your running off in this style?”

“Oh, keep still!” replied Jimmie.“We’re going off on a mission for Mr.You never should have butted in!”

“Oh, let him go!” laughed Sam, as the clamor of the motors gradually
made conversation impossible.“Perhaps he’ll freeze to death and drop
off before long.I guess we’ve got food enough!”

There was no moon in the sky as yet, but the tropical stars looked down
with surprising brilliancy.The country below lay spread out like a
great map.As the lights of Quito faded away in the distance, dark
mountain gorges which looked like giant gashes in the face of mother
earth, mountain cones which seemed to seek companionship with the stars
themselves, and fertile valleys green because of the presence of
mountain streams, swept by sharply and with the rapidity of scenes in a
motion-picture house.As had been said, the _Ann_ had been constructed for the private use of
the millionaire aviator, and was considered by experts to be the
strongest and swiftest aeroplane in the world.On previous tests she had
frequently made as high as one hundred miles an hour on long trips.The
motion of the monster machine in the air was so stable that the
millionaire had often taken prizes for endurance which entitled him to
medals for uninterrupted flights.Jimmie declares to this day that the fastest express train which ever
traveled over the gradeless lines of mother earth had nothing whatever
on the flight of the _Ann_ that night!Although Sam kept the machine
down whenever possible, there were places where high altitudes were
reached in crossing cone summits and mountain chains.At such times the temperature was so low that the boys shivered in their
seat, and more than once Jimmie and Carl protested by signs and gestures
against such high sailing.At two o’clock when the moon rose, bringing every detail of the country
into bold relief, Sam circled over a green valley and finally brought
the aeroplane down to a rest hardly more than four thousand feet above
sea-level.It was warm here, of course, and the two boys almost dropped
from their seat as the fragrant air of the grass-grown valley reached
their nostrils.While Sam busied himself with the running gear of the
flying machine, Jimmie and Carl sprawled out on the lush grass and
compared notes.The moonlight struck the valley so as to illuminate its
western rim while the eastern surface where the machine lay was still
heavy in shadows.“Jiminy!” exclaimed Jimmie, lifting himself on one elbow and gazing at
the wrinkled cones standing all around the valley.“I wonder how Sam
ever managed to drop into this cosy little nest without breaking all our
necks.”

Sam, who seemed to be unaffected by the cold and the strain of the long
flight, stood, oil-can in hand, when the question was asked.In a moment
he walked over to where the boys lay.“I can tell you about that,” he said with a smile.“Not long ago I had a
job running an old ice-wagon of an aeroplane over this country for a
naturalist.We passed this spot several times, and at last came back
here for a rest.Not to put too fine a point upon it, as Micawber would
say, we remained here so long that I became thoroughly acquainted with
the country.It is a lonesome little valley, but a pleasant one.”

“Well, what did we come here for?” asked Carl, in a moment, “and how far
are we from Quito?Seems like a thousand miles!”

“We are something like four hundred miles from the capital city of
Ecuador,” Sam replied, “and the reason why we landed here will be
disclosed when you chase yourselves along the valley and turn to the
right around the first cliff and come face to face with the cunningest
little lake you ever saw, also the haunted temple which stands there!”




                              CHAPTER XII.“A haunted temple?” echoed Jimmie.“I thought the haunted temples were a
lot farther south.”

“There are haunted temples all over Peru, if you leave it to the
natives,” answered Sam.“Whenever there is a reason for keeping
strangers away from such ruins as we are about to visit, the ghosts come
forth at night in white robes and wave weird lights above skeleton
faces.”

“Quit it!” cried Carl.“I’ve got the creeps running up and down my back
right now!Bring me my haunted temples by daylight!”

“Yes,” scorned Jimmie, “we’ll bring you a little pet ghost in a
suit-case.That would be about your size!”

“Honest,” grinned the boy, “I’m scared half to death.”

“What’s the specialty of the ghosts who inhabit this ruined temple?”
asked Jimmie.“Can’t you give us some idea of their antics?”

“If I remember correctly,” Sam replied, with a laugh, “the specialty of
the spirits to whom I am about to introduce you consists of low, soft
music.How does that suit?”

“I tell you to quit it!” cried Carl.“After I prepare the aeroplane for another run,” Sam went on, with a
grin, “I’ll take you around to the temple, if you like.”

“Mother of Moses!” cried Carl.“My hair’s all on end now; and I won’t
dare look into a mirror in the morning for fear I’ll find it turned
white.”

“There’s a strange feeling in my system, too!” Jimmie declared, “but I
think it comes from a lack of sustenance.”

“Jimmie,” declared Carl reproachfully, “I believe you would pick the
pocket of a wailing ghost of a ham sandwich, if he had such a thing
about him!”

“Sure I would!” answered the boy.“What would a ghost want of a ham
sandwich?In those old days the people didn’t eat pork anyway.If you
read the history of those days, you’ll find no mention of the wriggly
little worms which come out of pigs and made trouble for the human
race.”

“Well, if you’re ready now,” Sam broke in, “we’ll take a walk around the
corner of the cliff and see if the ghosts are keeping open house
to-night.”

“You really don’t believe in these ghosts, do you?” asked Jimmie.“I do not!” was the reply.“There ain’t no such animal, is there?” asked Carl.“I have never witnessed any ‘supernatural’ things,” Sam answered, “which
could not be traced eventually to some human agency.Usually to some
interested human agency.”

“Well,” grinned Carl, “if there ain’t any ghosts at this ruined temple,
what’s the use of my going there to see them?”

“You may remain and watch the machine if you care to,” Sam replied.“While we are supposed to be in a valley rarely frequented by human
kind, it may be just as well to leave some one on guard.For instance,”
the young man went on, “a jaguar might come along and eat up the
motors!”

“Jaguars?” exclaimed Carl.“Are they the leopard-like animals that chase
wild horses off the pampas of Brazil, and devour men whenever they get
particularly hungry?”

“The same!” smiled Sam.“Then I want to see the ghosts!” exclaimed Carl.“Come along, then,” advised Sam.“If you didn’t know Carl right well,” Jimmie explained, as they walked
along, “you’d really think he’d tremble at the sight of a ghost or a
wild animal, but he’s the most reckless little idiot in the whole bunch!He’ll talk about being afraid, and then he’ll go and do things that any
boy in his right mind ought not to think of doing.”

“I had an idea that that was about the size of it!” smiled Sam.Presently the party turned the angle of the cliff and came upon a placid
little mountain lake which lay glistening under the moonlight.“Now, where’s your ruined temple?” asked Carl.“At the southern end of the lake,” was the reply.“I see it!” cried Jimmie.“There’s a great white stone that might have
formed part of a tower at one time, and below it is an opening which
looks like an entrance to the New York subway with the lights turned
off.”

The old temple at the head of the lake had frequently been visited by
scientists and many descriptions of it had been written.It stood boldly
out on a headland which extended into the clear waters, and had
evidently at one time been surrounded by gardens.“I don’t see anything very mysterious about that!” Carl remarked.“It
looks to me as if contractors had torn down a cheap old building in
order to erect a skyscraper on the site, and then been pulled off the
job.”

“Wait until you get to it!” warned Jimmie.“I’m listening right now for the low, soft music!” laughed Carl.“Does any one live there?” asked Jimmie in a moment.“As the place is thought by the natives to be haunted,” Sam answered,
“the probability is that no one has set foot inside the place since the
naturalist and myself explored its ruined corridors several weeks ago.”

The boys passed farther on toward the temple, and at last paused on the
north side of a little arm of the lake which would necessitate a wide
detour to the right.From the spot where they stood, the walls of the temple glittered as if
at sometime in the distant past they had been ornamented with designs in
silver and gold.The soft wind of the valley sighed through the openings
mournfully, and it required no vigorous exercise of the imagination to
turn the sounds into man-made music.“Come on, Jimmie,” Carl shouted.“Let’s go and get a front seat.The
concert is just about to begin!”

“There is no hurry!” Jimmy answered.While the three stood viewing the scene, one which never passed from
their memory, a tall, stately figure passed out of the entrance to the
old temple and moved with dignified leisure toward the margin of the
lake.“Now, who’s that?” demanded Carl.“The names of the characters appear on the program in the order of their
entrance!” suggested Jimmie.“Honest, boys,” Sam whispered, “I think you fellows deserve a medal
apiece.Instead of being awed and frightened, standing as you do in the
presence of the old temple, and seeing, as you do, the mysterious figure
moving about, one would think you were occupying seats at a minstrel
show!”

“You said yourself,” insisted Jimmie, “that there wasn’t any such thing
as ghosts.”

“That’s right,” exclaimed Carl.“What’s the use of getting scared at
something that doesn’t exist?”

“The only question in my mind at the present time,” Jimmie went on, with
a grin, “is just this: Is that fellow over there carrying a gun?”

While the boys talked in whispers, Sam had been moving slowly to the
west so as to circle the little cove which separated him from the
temple.In a moment the boys saw him beckoning them to him and pointing toward
the ruins opposite.The figure which had been before observed was now standing close to the
lip of the lake, waving his hands aloft, as if in adoration or
supplication.This posture lasted only a second and then the figure
disappeared as if by magic.There were the smooth waters of the lake with the ruined temple for a
background.There were the moonbeams bringing every detail of the scene
into strong relief.Nothing had changed, except that the person who a
moment before had stood in full view had disappeared as if the earth had
opened at his feet.“Now what do you think of that?” demanded Jimmie.“Say,” chuckled Carl, “do you think that fellow is custodian of the
temple, and has to do that stunt every night, the same as a watchman in
New York has to turn a key in a clock every hour?”

Jimmie nudged his chum in the ribs in appreciation of the observation,
and then stood silent, his eyes fixed on the broken tower across the
cove.While he looked a red light burned for an instant at the apex of the old
tower, and in an instant was followed by a blue light farther up on the
cliff.“You didn’t answer my question,” Carl insisted, in a moment.“Do you
think they pull off this stunt here every night?”

“Oh, keep still!” exclaimed Jimmie.“They don’t have to pull it off
every night.They only put the play on when there’s an audience.”

“An audience?” repeated Carl.“How do they know they’ve got an
audience?”

“Chump!” replied Jimmie scornfully.“Do you think any one can sail an
aeroplane like the _Ann_ over this country without its being seen?Of
course they know they’ve got an audience.”

By this time the boys had advanced to the place where Sam was standing.They found that young man very much interested in the proceedings, and
also very much inclined to silence.“Did you see anything like that when you were here before?” asked
Jimmie.“Did they put the same kind of a show on for you?”

Sam shook his head gravely.“Well, come on!” Carl cried.“Let’s chase around the cove and get those
front seats you spoke about.”

“Wait, boys!” Sam started to say, but before the words were well out of
his mouth the two lads were running helter-skelter along the hard white
beach which circled the western side of the cove.“Come back!” he called to them softly.“It isn’t safe.”

The boys heard the words but paid no heed, so Sam followed swiftly on in
pursuit.He came up with them only after they had reached the very steps
which had at some distant time formed an imposing entrance to a sacred
temple.“What are you going to do?” he demanded.“We’re going inside!” replied Carl.“What do you think we came here for?I guess we’ve got to see the inside.”

“Don’t take any unnecessary risks!” advised Sam.“What’d you bring us here for?” asked Carl.“Oh, come on!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Let’s all go in together!”

Sam hesitated, but the boys seized him by the arms and almost forced him
along.In a moment, however, he was as eager as the others.“Do you mean to say,” asked Jimmie, as they paused for a moment on a
broad stone slab which lay before the portal of the ruined temple, “that
you went inside on your former visit?”

“I certainly did!” was the reply.“Then why are you backing up now?” asked Carl.“On my previous visit,” Sam explained, standing with his back against
the western wall of the entrance, “there were no such demonstrations as
we have seen to-night.Now think that over, kiddies, and tell me what it
means.It’s mighty puzzling to me!”

“Oh, we’ve got the answer to that!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Did you come here
in an aeroplane, or did you walk in?”

“We came in on an aeroplane, early in the morning,” was the reply.“That’s the answer!” exclaimed Jimmie.“The people who are operating
these ghost stunts did not know you were coming because they saw no
lights in the sky.Now we came down with a noise like an express train
and a great big acetylene lamp burning full blast.Don’t you see?”

“That’s the idea!” Carl cried.“The actors and stage hands all
disappeared as soon as you showed around the angle of the cliff.”

“But why should they go through what you call their stunts at this time,
and not on the occasion of my former visit?” asked Sam.“I’ll tell you,” replied Jimmie wrinkling his freckled nose, “there’s
some one who is interested in the case which called us to Peru doing
those stunts.”

“In that case,” Sam declared, “they have a definite reason for keeping
us out of this particular ruin!”

“That’s the idea!” exclaimed Jimmie.“So far as we know, this man
Redfern or some of his associates may be masquerading as ghosts.”

“I came to this temple to-night,” explained Sam, “thinking that perhaps
this might be one of the way stations on the road to Lake Titicaca.”

“You have guessed it!” exclaimed Jimmie.“The men who have been sent
south to warn Redfern are doing their first stunts here!”

“And that,” said Sam, “makes our position a dangerous one!”




                             CHAPTER XIII.“I wonder if they expect to scare us out of the country by such
demonstrations as that?” scoffed Carl.“There is, doubtless, some reason for this demonstration,” Sam observed,
thoughtfully, “other than the general motive to put us in terror of
haunted temples, but just now I can’t see what it is.”

“Redfern may be hiding in there!” suggested Jimmie, with a wink.“Go on!” exclaimed Carl.Havens say that Redfern was in the
vicinity of Lake Titicaca?How could he be here, then?”

“Mr.Havens only said that Redfern was believed to be in the vicinity of
Lake Titicaca,” Sam corrected.“Then they don’t even know where he is!” exclaimed Carl.“Of course they don’t,” laughed Sam.“If they did, they’d go there and
get him.That’s an easy one to answer!”

“Well, if Redfern isn’t in that ruin,” Jimmie declared, “then his own
friends don’t know where he is!”

“Yes, it seems to me,” Sam agreed, “that the men who are trying to reach
him are as much at sea as we are regarding his exact location.”

“If they wasn’t,” Jimmie declared, “they wouldn’t be staging such plays
as that on general principles!”

“Well!” exclaimed Carl.“Here we stand talking as if we had positive
information that the Redfern gang is putting on those stunts, while, as
a matter of fact, we don’t know whether they are or not!”

“And that’s a fact, too!” said Jimmie.“The people in there may be
ignorant of the fact that a man named Redfern ever existed.”

“But the chances are that the Redfern bunch is doing the work all the
same!” insisted Sam.“The only way to find out is to go on in and see!” declared Carl.“Well, come on, then!” exclaimed Jimmie.The two boys darted in together, leaving Sam standing alone for an
instant.He saw the illumination thrown on the interior walls by their
searchlights and lost no time in following on after them.There was not even the sound of bird’s
call or wing.The moonlight, filtering in through a break in what had
once been a granite roof, showed bare white walls with little heaps of
debris in the corners.“It seems to me,” Sam said, as he looked around, “that the ghosts have
chosen a very uncomfortable home.”

“There must be other rooms,” suggested Carl.“There are two which still retain the appearance of apartments as
originally constructed,” replied Sam, “one to the right, and one to the
left.There seems, also, to have been an extension at the rear, but that
is merely a heap of hewn stones at this time.”

As the young man ceased speaking the two boys darted through an opening
in the west wall, swinging their flashlights about as they advanced into
what seemed to be a stone-walled chamber of fair size.Following close
behind, Sam saw the lads directing the rays of their electrics upon a
series of bunks standing against the west wall.The sleeping places were
well provided with pillows and blankets, and seemed to have been very
recently occupied.Sam stepped closer and bent over one of the bunks.“Now, what do you think about ghosts and ghost lights?” asked Jimmie.“These ghosts,” Carl cut in, “seem to have a very good idea as to what
constitutes comfort.”

“Three beds!” exclaimed Jimmie, flashing his light along the wall.“And
that must mean three ghosts!”

Sam proceeded to a corner of the room as yet uninvestigated and was not
much surprised when the round eye of his electric revealed a rough
table, made of wooden planks, bearing dishes and remnants of food.He
called at once to the boys and they gathered about him.“Also,” Carl chuckled, “the three ghosts do not live entirely upon
spiritual food.See there,” he continued, “they’ve had some kind of a
stew, probably made out of game shot in the mountains.”

“And they’ve been making baking powder biscuit, too!” Carl added.“I don’t suppose it would be safe to sample that stew?” Jimmie asked
questioningly.“It looks good enough to eat!”

“Not for me!” declared Carl.While the boys were examining the table and passing comment on the
articles it held, Sam moved softly to the doorway by which they had
entered and looked out into the corridor.Looking from the interior out
to the moonlit lake beyond, the place lost somewhat of the dreary
appearance it had shown when viewed under the searchlights.The walls
were of white marble, as was the floor, and great slashes in the slabs
showed that at one time they had been profusely ornamented with designs
in metal, probably in gold and silver.The moonlight, filtering through the broken roof, disclosed a depression
in the floor in a back corner.This, Sam reasoned, had undoubtedly held
the waters of the fountain hundreds of years before.Directly across
from the doorway in which he stood he saw another break in the wall.On a previous visit this opening, which had once been a doorway, had
been entirely unobstructed.Now a wall of granite blocks lay in the
interior of the apartment, just inside the opening.It seemed to the
young man from where he stood that there might still be means of
entrance by passing between this newly-built wall and the inner surface
of the chamber.Thinking that he would investigate the matter more fully in the future,
Sam turned back to where the boys were standing, still commenting on the
prepared food lying on the table.As he turned back a low, heavy grumble
agitated the air of the apartment.The boys turned quickly, and the three stood not far from the opening in
listening attitudes.The sound increased in volume as the moments
passed.At first it seemed like the heavy vibrations of throat cords,
either human or animal.Then it lifted into something like a shrill
appeal, which resembled nothing so much as the scream of a woman in
deadly peril.Involuntarily the boys stepped closer to the corridor.“What do you make of it?” whispered Jimmie.“Ghosts!” chuckled Carl.“Some day,” Jimmie suggested, in a graver tone than usual, “you’ll be
punished for your verbal treatment of ghosts!I don’t believe there’s
anything on the face of the earth you won’t make fun of.How do we know
that spirits don’t come back to earth?”

“They may, for all I know,” replied Carl.“I’m not trying to decide the
question, or to make light of it, either, but when I see the lot of
cheap imitations like we’ve been put against to-night, I just have to
express my opinion.”

“They’re cheap imitations, all right!” decided Jimmie.“Cheap?” repeated Carl.“Flowing robes, and disappearing figures, and
mysterious lights, and weird sounds!Why, a fellow couldn’t work off
such manifestations as we’ve seen to-night on the most superstitious
residents of the lower West Side in the City of New York, and they’ll
stand for almost anything!”

“It strikes me,” Sam, who had been listening to the conversation with an
amused smile, declared, “that the sounds we are listening to now may
hardly be classified as wailing!”

“Now, listen,” Carl suggested, “and we’ll see if we can analyze it.”

At that moment the sound ceased.The place seemed more silent than before because of the sudden
cessation.“It doesn’t want to be analyzed!” chuckled Carl.“Come on,” Jimmie urged, “let’s go and see what made it!”

“I think you’ll have to find out where it came from first!” said Carl.“It came from the opening across the second apartment,” explained Sam.“I had little difficulty in locating it.”

“That doesn’t look to me like much of an opening,” argued Carl.“The stones you see,” explained Sam, “are not laid in the entrance from
side to side.They are built up back of the entrance, and my idea is
that there must be a passage-way between them and the interior walls of
the room.That wall, by the way, has been constructed since my previous
visit.So you see,” he added, turning to Carl, “the ghosts in this neck
of the woods build walls as well as make baking powder biscuits.”

“Well, that’s a funny place to build a wall!” Carl asserted.“Perhaps the builders don’t like the idea of their red and blue lights
and ghostly apparatus being exposed to the gaze of the vulgar public,”
suggested Jimmie.“That room is probably the apartment behind the scenes
where the thunder comes from, and where some poor fellow of a supe is
set to holding up the moon!”

“Well, why don’t we go and find out about it?” urged Carl.“Wait until I take a look on the outside,” Sam requested.“The man in
the long white robe may be rising out of the lake by this time.I don’t
know,” he continued, “but that we have done a foolish thing in remaining
here as we have, leaving the aeroplane unguarded.”

“Perhaps I’d better run around the cliff and see if it’s all right!”
suggested Carl.“I’ll be back in a minute.”

“No,” Sam argued, “you two remain here at the main entrance and I’ll go
and see about the machine.Perhaps,” he warned, “you’d better remain
right here, and not attempt to investigate that closed apartment until I
return.I shan’t be gone very long.”

“Oh, of course,” replied Jimmie, “we’ll be good little boys and stand
right here and wait for you to come back—not!”

Carl chuckled as the two watched the young man disappear around the
angle of the cliff.“Before he gets back,” the boy said, “we’ll know all about that room,
won’t we?Say,” he went on in a moment, “I think this haunted temple
business is about the biggest fraud that was ever staged.If people only
knew enough to spot an impostor when they saw one, there wouldn’t be
prisons enough in the world to hold the rascals.”

“You tell that to Sam to-night,” laughed Jimmie.“He likes these
moralizing stunts.Are you going in right now?”

By way of reply Carl stepped into the arch between the two walls and
turned to the right into a passage barely more than a foot in width.Jimmie followed his example, but turned to the left.There the way was
blocked by a granite boulder which reached from the floor to the roof
itself.“Nothing doing here!” he called back to Carl.“I’ve found the way!” the latter answered.We’ll be
behind the scenes in about a minute.”

The passage was not more than a couple of yards in length and gave on an
open chamber which seemed, under the light of the electrics, to be
somewhat larger than the one where the conveniences of living had been
found.The faint illumination produced by the flashlights, of course
revealed only a small portion of it at a time.While the boys stood at the end of the narrow passage, studying the
interior as best they might under the circumstances, a sound which came
like the fall of a heavy footstep in the corridor outside reached their
ears.“There’s Sam!” Carl exclaimed.“We’ll leave him at the entrance and go
in.There’s a strange smell here, eh?”

“Smells like a wild animal show!” declared Jimmie.Other footsteps were now heard in the corridor, and Jimmie turned back
to speak with Sam.“That’s Sam all right enough!” the latter exclaimed.“Don’t go away
right now, anyhow.”

“What’s doing?” asked Jimmie.“There’s a light back there!” was the reply, “and some one is moving
around.Can’t you hear the footsteps on the hard stone floor?”

“Mighty soft footsteps!” suggested Jimmie.“Well, I’m going to know exactly what they are!” declared Carl.“Well, why don’t you go on, then?” demanded Jimmie.The two boys stepped forward, walking in the shaft of light proceeding
from their electrics.Once entirely clear of the passage, they kept
straight ahead along the wall and turned the lights toward the center of
the apartment, which seemed darker and drearier than the one recently
visited.Besides the smell of mold and a confined atmosphere there was an odor
which dimly brought back to the minds of the boys previous visits to the
homes of captive animals at the Central Park zoo.“Here!” cried Jimmie directly, “there’s a door just closed behind us!”




                              CHAPTER XIV.When Sam Weller turned the corner of the cliff and looked out at the
spot where the _Ann_ had been left, his first impression was that the
machine had been removed from the valley.He stood for a moment in uncertainty and then, regretting sincerely that
he had remained so long away, cautiously moved along, keeping as close
as possible to the wall of the cliff.In a moment he saw the planes of
the _Ann_ glistening in the moonlight at least a hundred yards from the
place where she had been left.Realizing the presence of hostile interests, he walked on toward the
planes, hoping to be able to get within striking distance before being
discovered.There was no one in sight in the immediate vicinity of the
_Ann_, and yet she was certainly moving slowly over the ground.The inference the young man drew from this was that persons unfamiliar
with flying machines had invaded the valley during his absence.Not
being able to get the machine into the air, they were, apparently, so
far as he could see, rolling it away on its rubber-tired wheels.The
progress was not rapid, but was directed toward a thicket which lay at
the west end of the valley.“That means,” the young man mused, “that they’re trying to steal the
machine!It is evident,” he went on, “that they are apprehensive of
discovery, for they manage to keep themselves out of sight.”

Realizing that it would be impossible for him to pass through the open
moonlight without being observed by those responsible for the erratic
motions of the _Ann_, the young man remained standing perfectly still in
a deep shadow against the face of the cliff.The _Ann_ moved on toward the thicket, and presently reached the shelter
of trees growing there.In a moment she was entirely hidden from view.“Now,” thought Sam, “the people who have been kind enough to change the
position of the machine will doubtless show themselves in the
moonlight.”

In this supposition he was not mistaken, for in a moment two men dressed
in European garments emerged from the shadows of the grove and took
their way across the valley, walking through the moonlight boldly and
with no pretense of concealment.Sam scrutinized the fellows carefully, but could not remember that he
had ever seen either of them before.They were dusky, supple chaps,
evidently of Spanish descent.As they walked they talked together in
English, and occasionally pointed to the angle of the cliff around which
the young man had recently passed.A chattering of excited voices at the edge of the grove now called Sam’s
attention in that direction, and he saw at least half a dozen figures,
apparently those of native Indians, squatting on the ground at the very
edge of the thicket.“And now,” mused Sam, as the men stopped not far away and entered into
what seemed to him to be an excited argument, “I’d like to know how
these people learned of the revival of the hunt for Redfern!It isn’t so
very many days since Havens’ expedition was planned in New York, and
this valley is a good many hundred miles away from that merry old town.”

Entirely at a loss to account for the manner in which information of
this new phase of the search had reached a point in the wilds of Peru
almost as soon as the record-breaking aeroplane could have carried the
news, the young man gave up the problem for the time being and devoted
his entire attention to the two men in European dress.“I tell you they are in the temple,” one of the men said speaking in a
corrupt dialect of the English language which it is useless to attempt
to reproduce.“They are in the temple at this minute!”

“Don’t be too sure of that, Felix!” the other said.“And what is more,” the man who had been called Felix went on, “they
will never leave the temple alive!”

“And so fails the great expedition!” chuckled the second speaker.“When we are certain that what must be has actually taken place,” Felix
went on, “I’ll hide the flying machine in a safer place, pay you as
agreed, and make my way back to Quito.Does that satisfy you?”

“I shall be satisfied when I have the feeling of the gold of the
Gringoes!” was the reply.Sam caught his breath sharply as he listened to the conversation.“There was some trap in the temple, then,” he mused, “designed to get us
out of the way.I should have known that,” he went on, bitterly, “and
should never have left the boys alone there!”

The two men advanced nearer to the angle of the cliff and seemed to be
waiting the approach of some one from the other side.“And Miguel?” asked Felix.“Why is he not here?”

“Can you trust him?” he added, in a moment.“With my own life!”

“The Gringoes are clever!” warned Felix.“But see!” exclaimed the other.There surely can be no mistake.”

The men lapsed into silence and stood listening.Sam began to hope that
their plans had indeed gone wrong.For a moment he was uncertain as to what he ought to do.He believed
that in the absence of the two leaders he might be able to get the _Ann_
into the air and so bring assistance to the boys.And yet, he could not
put aside the impression that immediate assistance was the only sort
which could ever be of any benefit to the two lads!“If they are in some trap in the temple,” he soliloquized, “the thing to
do is to get to them as soon as possible, even if we do lose the
machine, which, after all, is not certain.”

“The flying machine,” the man who had been called Felix was now heard to
say, “is of great value.It would bring a fortune in London.”

“But how are you to get it out of this district just at this time?”
asked the other.“How to get it out without discovery?”

“Fly it out!”

“Can you fly it out?” asked the other in a sarcastic tone.“There are plenty who can!” replied Felix, somewhat angrily.“But it is
not to be taken out at present,” he went on.“To lift it in the air now
would be to notify every Gringo from Quito to Lima that the prize
machine of the New York Millionaire, having been stolen, is in this part
of the country.”

“That is very true,” replied the other.“Hence, I have hidden it,” Felix went on.Are they safe?” was the next question.“As safe as such people usually are!” was the answer.As Sam Weller listened, his mind was busily considering one expedient
after another, plan after plan, which presented the least particle of
hope for the release of the boys.From the conversation he had overheard
he understood that the machine would not be removed for a number of
days—until, in fact, the hue and cry over its loss had died out.This, at least, lightened the difficulties to some extent.He could
devote his entire attention to the situation at the temple without
thought of the valuable aeroplane, but how to get to the temple with
those two ruffians in the way!Only for the savage associates in the
background, it is probable that he would have opened fire on the two
schemers.That was a sufficient reason, to
his mind, to bring about decisive action on his part.However, the
savages were there, just at the edge of the forest, and an attack on the
two leaders would undoubtedly bring them into action.Of course it was
not advisable for him to undertake a contest involving life and death
with such odds against him.The two men were still standing at the angle of the cliff.Only for the brilliant moonlight, Sam believed that he might elude their
vigilance and so make his way to the temple.But there was not a cloud
in the sky, and the illumination seemed to grow stronger every moment as
the moon passed over to the west.At last the very thing the young man had hoped for in vain took place.A
jumble of excited voices came from the thicket, and the men who were
watching turned instantly in that direction.As they looked, the sound
of blows and cries of pain came from the jungle.“Those brutes will be eating each other alive next!” exclaimed Felix.“That is so!” answered the other.“I warned you!”

“Suppose you go back and see what’s wrong?” suggested Felix.“I have no influence over the savages,” was the reply, “and besides, the
temple must be watched.”

With an exclamation of anger Felix started away in the direction of the
forest.It was evident that he had his work cut out for him there, for
the savages were fighting desperately, and his approach did not appear
to terminate the engagement.The man left at the angle of the cliff to watch and wait for news from
the temple moved farther around the bend and stood leaning against the
cliff, listening.The rattling of a
pebble betrayed the young man’s presence, and his hands upon the throat
of the other alone prevented an outcry which would have brought Felix,
and perhaps several of the savages, to the scene.It was a desperate, wordless, almost noiseless, struggle that ensued.The young man’s muscles, thanks to months of mountain exercise and
freedom from stimulants and narcotics, were hard as iron, while those of
his opponent seemed flabby and out of condition, doubtless because of
too soft living in the immediate past.The contest, therefore, was not of long duration.Realizing that he was
about to lapse into unconsciousness, Sam’s opponent threw out his hands
in token of surrender.The young man deftly searched the fellow’s person
for weapons and then drew him to his feet.“Now,” he said, presenting his automatic to the fellow’s breast, “if you
utter a word or signal calculated to bring you help, that help will come
too late, even if it is only one instant away.At the first sound or
indication of resistance, I’ll put half a clip of bullets through your
heart!”

“You have the victory!” exclaimed the other sullenly.“Move along toward the temple!” demanded Sam.“It is not for me to go there!” was the reply.“And I’ll walk along behind you,” Sam went on, “and see that you have a
ballast of bullets if any treachery is attempted.”

“It is forbidden me to go to the temple to-night,” the other answered,
“but, under the circumstances, I go!”

Fearful that Felix might return at any moment, or that the savages,
enraged beyond control, might break away in the direction of the temple,
Sam pushed the fellow along as rapidly as possible, and the two soon
came to the great entrance of that which, centuries before, had been a
sacred edifice.The fellow shuddered as he stepped into the musty
interior.“It is not for me to enter!” he said.“And now,” Sam began, motioning his captive toward the chamber where the
bunks and provisions had been discovered, “tell me about this trap which
was set to-night for my chums.”

“I know nothing!” was the answer.“That is false,” replied Sam.“I overheard the conversation you had with
Felix before the outbreak of the savages.”

“I know nothing!” insisted the other.“Now, let me tell you this,” Sam said, flashing his automatic back and
forth under the shaft of light which now fell almost directly upon the
two, “my friends may be in deadly peril at this time.It may be that one
instant’s hesitation on your part will bring them to death.”

The fellow shrugged his shoulders impudently and threw out his hands.Sam saw that he was watching the great entrance carefully, and became
suspicious that some indication of the approach of Felix had been
observed.“I have no time to waste in arguments,” Sam went on excitedly.“The trap
you have set for my friends may be taking their lives at this moment.I
will give you thirty seconds in which to reveal to me their whereabouts,
and to inform me as to the correct course to take in order to protect
them.”

The fellow started back and fixed his eyes again on the entrance, and
Sam, following his example, saw something which sent the blood rushing
to his heart.Outlined on the white stone was the shadow of a human being!Although not in sight, either an enemy or a friend was at hand!“Door?” repeated Carl, in reply to his chum’s exclamation.“There’s no
door here!”

“But there is!” insisted Jimmie.“I heard the rattle of iron against
granite only a moment ago!”

As the boy spoke he turned his flashlight back to the narrow passage and
then, catching his chum by the arm, pointed with a hand which was not
altogether steady to an iron grating which had swung or dropped from
some point unknown into a position which effectually barred their return
to the outer air!The bars of the gate, for it was little else, were not
brown and rusty but bright and apparently new.“That’s a new feature of the establishment,” Jimmie asserted.“That gate
hasn’t been long exposed to this damp air!”

“I don’t care how long it hasn’t been here!” Carl said, rather crossly.“What I want to know is how long is it going to remain there?”

“I hope it will let us out before dinner time,” suggested Jimmie.“Away, you and your appetite!” exclaimed Carl.“I suppose you think this
is some sort of a joke.You make me tired!”

“And the fact that we couldn’t get out if we wanted to,” Jimmie grinned,
“makes me hungry!”

“Cut it out!” cried Carl.“The thing for us to do now is to find some
way of getting by that man-made obstruction.”

“Man-made is all right!” agreed Jimmie.“It is perfectly clear, now,
isn’t it, that the supernatural had nothing to do with the
demonstrations we have seen here!”

“I thought you understood that before!” cried Carl, impatiently.Jimmie, who stood nearest to the gate, now laid a hand upon one of the
upright bars and brought his whole strength to bear.The obstruction
rattled slightly but remained firm.“Can’t move it!” the boy said.“We may have to tear the wall down!”

“And the man who swung the gate into position?” questioned Carl.“What
do you think he’ll be doing while we’re pulling down that heap of
stones?You’ve got to think of something better than that, my son!”

“Anyway,” Jimmie said, hopefully, “Sam is on the outside, and he’ll soon
find out that we’ve been caught in a trap.”

“I don’t want to pose as a prophet of evil, or anything like that,” Carl
went on, “but it’s just possible that he may have been caught in a trap,
too.Anyway, it’s up to us to go ahead and get out, if we can, without
any reference to assistance from the outside.”

“Go ahead, then!” Jimmie exclaimed.“I’m in with anything you propose!”

The boys now exerted their united strength on the bars of the gate, but
all to no purpose.So far as they could determine, the iron contrivance
had been dropped down from above into grooves in the stone-work on
either side.The bars were an inch or more in thickness, and firmly
enclosed in parallel beams of small size which crossed them at regular
intervals.Seeing the condition of affairs, Jimmie suggested:

“Perhaps we can push it up!”

“Anything is worth trying!” replied Carl.But the gate was too firmly in place to be moved, even a fraction of an
inch, by their joint efforts.“Now, see here,” Jimmie said, after a short and almost painful silence,
“there’s no knowing how long we may be held in this confounded old
dungeon.We’ll need light as long as we’re here, so I suggest that we
use only one flashlight at a time.”

“That will help some!” answered Carl, extinguishing his electric.Jimmie threw his light along the walls of the chamber and over the
floor.There appeared to be no break of any kind in the white marble
which shut in the apartment, except at one point in a distant corner,
where a slab had been removed.“Perhaps,” suggested Carl, “the hole in the corner is exactly the thing
we’re looking for.”

“It strikes me,” said Jimmie, “that one of us saw a light in that corner
not long ago.I don’t remember whether you called my attention to it, or
whether I saw it first, but I remember that we talked about a light in
the apartment as we looked in.”

“Perhaps we’d better watch the hole a few minutes before moving over to
it,” suggested Carl.“The place it leads to may hold a group of savages,
or a couple of renegades, sent on here to make trouble for casual
visitors.”

“Casual visitors!” repeated Jimmie.“That doesn’t go with me!You know,
and I know, that this stage was set for our personal benefit!How the
Redfern bunch got the men in here so quickly, or how they got the
information into this topsy-turvy old country, is another question.”

“I presume you are right,” Carl agreed.“In some particulars,” the boy
went on, “this seems to me to be a situation somewhat similar to our
experiences in the California mountains.”

“Right you are!” cried Jimmie.The circle of light from the electric illuminated the corner where the
break in the wall had been observed only faintly.Determined to discover
everything possible regarding what might be an exit from the apartment,
Jimmie kept his light fixed steadily on that corner.In a couple of minutes Carl caught the boy by the arm and pointed along
the finger of light.“Hold it steadier now,” he said.“I saw a movement there just now.”

“What kind of a movement?” asked the other.“Looked like a ball of fire.”

“It may be the cat!” suggested Jimmie.“Quit your foolishness!” advised Carl impatiently.“This is a serious
situation, and there’s no time for any grandstanding!”

“A ball of fire!” repeated Jimmie scornfully.“What would a ball of fire
be doing there?”

“What would a blue ball of fire be doing on the roof?” asked Carl,
reprovingly.“Yet we saw one there, didn’t we?”

Although Jimmie was inclined to treat the situation as lightly as
possible, he knew very well that the peril was considerable.Like a good
many other boys in a trying situation, he was usually inclined to keep
his unpleasant mental processes to himself.He now engaged in what
seemed to Carl to be trivial conversation, yet the desperate situation
was no less firmly impressed upon his mind.The boys waited for some moments before speaking again, listening and
watching for the reappearance of the object which had attracted their
attention.“There!” Carl cried in a moment.“Move your light a little to the left.I’m sure I saw a flash of color pass the opening.”

“I saw that too!” Jimmie agreed.“Now what do you think it can be?”

In a moment there was no longer doubt regarding the presence at the
opening which was being watched so closely.The deep vocal vibrations
which had been noticed from the other chamber seemed to shake the very
wall against which the boy stood.As before, it was followed in a moment
by the piercing, lifting cry which on the first occasion had suggested
the appeal of a woman in agony or terror.The boys stood motionless, grasping each other by the hand, and so each
seeking the sympathy and support of the other, until the weird sound
died out.“And that,” said Jimmie in a moment, “is no ghost!”

“Ghost?” repeated Carl scornfully.“You may as well talk about a ghost
making that gate and setting it against us!”

“Anyway,” Jimmie replied, “the wail left an odor of sulphur in the air!”

“Yes,” answered Carl, “and the sulphur you speak of is a sulphur which
comes from the dens of wild beasts!Now do you know what we’re up
against?”

“Mountain lions!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Jaguars!” answered Carl.“I hope they’re locked in!” suggested Jimmie.“Can you see anything that looks like a grate before that opening?”
asked Carl.“I’m sure I can’t.”

“Nothing doing in that direction!” was the reply.At regular intervals, now, a great, lithe, crouching body could be seen
moving back and forth at the opening, and now and then a cat-like head
was pushed into the room!At such times the eyes of the animal, whatever
it was, shone like balls of red fire in the reflection of the electric
light.Although naturally resourceful and courageous, the two boys
actually abandoned hope of ever getting out of the place alive!“I wonder how many wild animals there are in there?” asked Carl in a
moment.“It seems to me that I have seen two separate figures.”

“There may be a dozen for all we know,” Jimmie returned.“Gee!” he
exclaimed, reverting to his habit of concealing serious thoughts by
lightly spoken words, “Daniel in the lion’s den had nothing on us!”

“How many shots have you in your automatic?” asked Carl, drawing his own
from his pocket.“We’ll have to do some shooting, probably.”

“Why, I have a full clip of cartridges,” Jimmie answered.“But have you?” insisted Carl.“Why, surely, I have!” returned Jimmie.“Don’t you remember we filled
our guns night before last and never——”

“I thought so!” exclaimed Carl, ruefully.“We put in fresh clips night
before last, and exploded eight or nine cartridges apiece on the return
trip to Quito.Now, how many bullets do you think you have available?One or two?”

“I don’t know!” replied Jimmie, and there was almost a sob in his voice
as he spoke.“I presume I have only one.”

“Perhaps the electric light may keep the brutes away,” said Carl
hopefully.“You know wild animals are afraid of fire.”

“Yes, it may,” replied Jimmie, “but it strikes me that our little
torches will soon become insufficient protectors.Those are jaguars out
there, I suppose you know.And they creep up to camp-fires and steal
savage children almost out of their mothers’ arms!”

“Where do you suppose Sam is by this time?” asked Carl, in a moment, as
the cat-like head appeared for the fourth or fifth time at the opening.“I’m afraid Sam couldn’t get in here in time to do us any good even if
he stood in the corridor outside!” was the reply.“Whatever is done,
we’ve got to do ourselves.”

“And that brings us down to a case of shooting!” Carl declared.“It’s only a question of time,” Jimmie went on, “when the jaguars will
become hungry enough to attack us.When they get into the opening, full
under the light of the electric, we’ll shoot.”

“I’ll hold the light,” Carl argued, “and you do the shooting.You’re a
better marksman than I am, you know!When your last cartridge is gone,
I’ll hand you my gun and you can empty that.If there’s only two animals
and you are lucky with your aim, we may escape with our lives so far as
this one danger is concerned.How we are to make our escape after that
is another matter.”

“If there are more than two jaguars,” Jimmie answered, “or if I’m
unlucky enough to injure one without inflicting a fatal wound, it will
be good-bye to the good old flying machines.”

“That’s about the size of it!” Carl agreed.All this conversation had occurred, of course, at intervals, whenever
the boys found the heart to put their hopes and plans into words.It
seemed to them that they had already spent hours in the desperate
situation in which they found themselves.The periods of silence,
however, had been briefer than they thought, and the time between the
departure of Sam and that moment was not much more than half an hour.“There are two heads now!” Jimmie said, after a time, “and they’re
coming out!Hold your light steady when they reach the center of the
room.I can’t afford to miss my aim.”

“Is your arm steady?” almost whispered Carl.“Never better!” answered Jimmie.Four powerful, hungry, jaguars, instead of two, crept out of the
opening!Jimmie tried to cheer his companion with the whispered hope
that there might possibly be bullets enough for them all, and raised his
weapon.Two shots came in quick succession, and two jaguars crumpled
down on the floor.Nothing daunted, the other brutes came on, and Jimmie
seized Carl’s automatic.The only question now was this:

How many bullets did the gun hold?BESIEGED IN THE TEMPLE.As Sam watched the shadow cast by the moonlight on the marble slab at
the entrance, his prisoner turned sharply about and lifted a hand as if
to shield himself from attack.“A savage!” he exclaimed in a terrified whisper.It seemed to Sam Weller at that moment that no word had ever sounded
more musically in his ears.The expression told him that a third element
had entered into the situation.He believed from recent experiences that
the savages who had been seen at the edge of the forest were not exactly
friendly to the two white men.Whether or not they would come to his
assistance was an open question, but at least there was a chance of
their creating a diversion in his favor.“How do you know the shadow is that of a savage?” asked Sam.The prisoner pointed to the wide doorway and crowded back behind his
captor.There, plainly revealed in the moonlight, were the figures of
two brawny native Indians!Felix was approaching the entrance with a
confident step, and the two watchers saw him stop for an instant and
address a few words to one of the Indians.The next moment the smile on
the fellow’s face shifted to a set expression of terror.Before he could utter another word, he received a blow on the head which
stretched him senseless on the smooth marble.Then a succession of
threatening cries came from the angle of the cliff, and half a dozen
Indians swarmed up to where the unconscious man lay!The prisoner now crouched behind his captor, his body trembling with
fear, his lips uttering almost incoherent appeals for protection.The savages glanced curiously into the temple for a moment and drew
their spears and bludgeons.He
heard blows and low hisses of enmity, but there came no outcry.When he looked again the moonlight showed a dark splotch on the white
marble, and that alone!“Mother of Mercy!” shouted the prisoner in a faltering tone.Daniel moved to the garden.“Where did they take him?” asked Sam.The prisoner shuddered and made no reply.The mute answer, however, was
sufficient.The young man understood that Felix had been murdered by the
savages within sound of his voice.“Why?” he asked the trembling prisoner.“Because,” was the hesitating answer, “they believe that only evil
spirits come out of the sky in the night-time.”

Sam remembered of his own arrival and that of his friends, and
congratulated himself and them that the savages had not been present to
witness the event.“And they think he came in the machine?” asked Sam.The prisoner shuddered and covered his face with his hands.“And now,” demanded Sam, “in order to save your own life, will you tell
me what I want to know?”

The old sullen look returned to the eyes of the captive.Perhaps he was
thinking of the great reward he might yet receive from his distant
employers if he could escape and satisfy them that the boys had perished
in the trap set for them.At any rate he refused to answer at that time.In fact his hesitation was a brief one, for while Sam waited, a finger
upon the trigger of his automatic, two shots came from the direction of
the chamber across the corridor, and the acrid smell of gunpowder came
to his nostrils.It was undoubtedly his belief
at that time that all his hopes of making a favorable report to his
employers had vanished.The shots, he understood, indicated resistance;
perhaps successful resistance.“Yes,” he said hurriedly, his knees almost giving way under the weight
of his shaking body.“Yes, I’ll tell you where your friends are.”

He hesitated and pointed toward the opposite entrance.“In there!” he cried.“Felix caused them to be thrown to the beasts!”

The young man seized the prisoner fiercely by the throat.“Show me the way!” he demanded.The captive still pointed to the masked entrance across the corridor and
Sam drew him along, almost by main force.When they came to the narrow
passage at the eastern end of which the barred gate stood, they saw a
finger of light directed into the interior of the apartment.While they looked, Sam scarcely knowing what course to pursue, two more
shots sounded from within, and the odor of burned powder became almost
unbearable.Sam threw himself against the iron gate and shouted out:

“Jimmie!Carl!”

“Here!” cried a voice out of the smoke.“Come to the gate with your gun.I missed the last shot, and Carl is down!”

Still pushing the prisoner ahead of him, Sam crowded through the narrow
passage and stood looking over the fellow’s shoulder into the
smoke-scented room beyond.His electric light showed Jimmie standing
with his back against the gate, his feet pushed out to protect the
figure of Carl, lying on the floor against the bars.The searchlight in
the boy’s hand was waving rhythmically in the direction of a pair of
gleaming eyes which looked out of the darkness.“My gun is empty!” Jimmie almost whispered.“I’ll hold the light
straight in his eyes, and you shoot through the bars.”

Sam forced the captive down on the corridor, where he would be out of
the way and still secure from escape, and fired two shots at the
blood-mad eyes inside.The great beast fell to the floor instantly and
lay still for a small fraction of a second then leaped to his feet
again.With jaws wide open and fangs showing threateningly, he sprang toward
Jimmie, but another shot from Sam’s automatic finished the work the
others had begun.Jimmie sank to the floor like one bereft of strength.“Get us out!” he said in a weak voice.“Open the door and get us out!One of the jaguars caught hold of Carl, and I thought I heard the
crunching of bones.The boy may be dead for all I know.”

Sam applied his great strength to the barred gate, but it only shook
mockingly under his straining hands.Then he turned his face downward to
where his prisoner lay cowering upon the floor.“Can you open this gate?” he asked.Once more the fellow’s face became stubborn.“Felix had the key!” he exclaimed.“All right!” cried Sam.“We’ll send you out to Felix to get it!”

He seized the captive by the collar as he spoke and dragged him, not too
gently, through the narrow passage and out into the main corridor.Once
there he continued to force him toward the entrance.The moon was now
low in the west and shadows here and there specked the little plaza in
front of the temple.In addition to the moonlight there was a tint of
gray in the sky which told of approaching day.The prisoner faced the weird scene with an expression of absolute
terror.He almost fought his way back into the temple.“Your choice!” exclaimed Sam.“The key to the gate or you return to the
savages!”

The fellow dropped to his knees and clung to his captor.“I have the key to the gate!” he declared.“But I am not permitted to
surrender it.You must take it from me.”

“You’re loyal to some one, anyhow!” exclaimed Sam, beginning a search of
the fellow’s pockets.At last the key was found, and Sam hurried away with it.He knew then
that there would be no further necessity for guarding the prisoner at
that time.The fact that the hostile savages were abroad and that he was
without weapons would preclude any attempt at escape.At first the young man found it difficult to locate the lock to which
the key belonged.At last he found it, however, and in a moment Jimmie
crept out of the chamber, trying his best to carry Carl in his arms.Are you hurt yourself?” he
added as Jimmie leaned against the wall.“I think,” Jimmie answered, “one of the brutes gave me a nip in the leg,
but I can walk all right.”

Sam carried Carl to the center of the corridor and laid him down on the
marble floor.A quick examination showed rather a bad wound on the left
shoulder from which considerable blood must have escaped.“He’ll be all right as soon as he regains his strength!” the young man
cried.“And now, Jimmie,” he went on, “let’s see about your wound.”

“It’s only a scratch,” the boy replied, “but it bled like fury, and I
think that’s what makes me so weak.Did we get all the jaguars?” he
added, with a wan smile.“I don’t seem to remember much about the last
two or three minutes.”

“Every last one of them!” answered Sam cheerfully.While Sam was binding Carl’s wound the boy opened his eyes and looked
about the apartment whimsically.“We seem to be alive yet,” he said, rolling his eyes so as to include
Jimmie in his line of vision.“I guess Jimmie was right when he said
that Daniel in the lions’ den was nothing to this.”

“But when they took Daniel out of the lions’ den,” cut in Jimmie, “they
brought him to a place where there was something doing in the way of
sustenance!What about that?”

“Cut it out!” replied Carl feebly.“But, honestly,” Jimmie exclaimed, “I never was so hungry in my life!”

The captive looked at the two boys with amazement mixed with admiration
in his eyes.“And they’re just out of the jaws of death!” he exclaimed.“Is that the greaser that put us into the den of lions?” asked Carl,
pointing to the prisoner.“No, no!” shouted the trembling man.Felix
laid the plans for your murder.”

“The keeper of what?” asked Sam.“Of the wild animals!” was the reply.“I catch them here for the
American shows.And now they are killed!” he complained.“So that contraption, the masked entrance, the iron gate, and all that,
was arranged to hold wild animals in captivity until they could be
transferred to the coast?” asked Sam.“Exactly!” answered the prisoner.“The natives helped me catch the
jaguars and I kept them for a large payment.Then, yesterday, a runner
told me that a strange white man sought my presence in the forest at the
top of the valley.I met him there, and he arranged with
me for the use of the wild-animal cage for only one night.”

“And you knew the use to which he intended to put it?” asked Sam
angrily.“You knew that he meant murder?”

“I did not!” was the reply.“He told Miguel what to do if any of you
entered and did not tell me.I was not to enter the temple to-night!”

“And where’s Miguel?” demanded the young man.The captive pointed to the broken roof of the temple.“Miguel remained here,” he said, “to let down the gate to the passage
and lift the grate which kept the jaguars in their den.”

“Do you think he’s up there now?” asked Jimmie.“I’d like to see this
person called Miguel.I have a few words to say to him.”

“No, indeed!” answered the prisoner.He probably
took to his heels when the shots were fired.”

The prisoner, who gave his name as Pedro, insisted that he knew nothing
whatever of the purpose of the man who secured his assistance in the
desperate game which had just been played.He declared that Felix seemed
to understand perfectly that Gringoes would soon arrive in flying
machines.He said that the machines were to be wrecked, and the
occupants turned loose in the mountains.It was Pedro’s idea that two, and perhaps three, flying machines were
expected.He said that Felix had no definite idea as to when they would
arrive.He only knew that he had been stationed there to do what he
could to intercept the progress of those on the machines.He said that
the machines had been seen from a distance, and that Felix and himself
had watched the descent into the valley from a secure position in the
forest.They had remained in the forest until the Gringoes had left for
the temple, and had then set about examining the machine.While examining the machine the savages had approached and had naturally
received the impression that Felix was the Gringo who had descended in
the aeroplane.He knew some of the Indians, he said.The Indians, he said, were very superstitious, and believed that flying
machines brought death and disaster to any country they visited.By
making them trifling presents he, himself, had succeeded in keeping on
good terms with them until the machine had descended and been hidden in
the forest.“But,” the prisoner added with a significant shrug of his shoulders,
“when we walked in the direction of the temple the Indians suspected
that Felix had come to visit the evil spirits they believed to dwell
there and so got beyond control.They would kill me now as they killed
him!”

“Do the Indians never attack the temple?” asked Sam.“Perhaps,” Pedro observed, with a sly smile, “you saw the figure in
flowing robes and the red and blue lights!”

“We certainly did!” answered Sam.“While the animals are being collected and held in captivity here,”
Pedro continued, “it is necessary to do such things in order to keep the
savages away.Miguel wears the flowing robes, and drops into the narrow
entrance to an old passage when he finds it necessary to disappear.The
Indians will never actually enter the temple, though they may besiege
it.”

“There goes your ghost story!” Carl interrupted.“Why,” he added, “it’s
about the most commonplace thing I ever heard of!The haunted temple is
just headquarters for the agents of an American menagerie!”

“And all this brings up the old questions,” Jimmie said.“How did the
Redfern bunch know that any one of our airships would show up here?How
did they secure the presence of an agent so far in the interior in so
short a time?I think I’ve asked these questions before!” he added,
grinning.“But I have no recollection of their ever having been answered,” said
Sam.“Say,” questioned Jimmie, with a wink at Carl, “how long is this seance
going to last without food?I’d like to know if we’re never going to
have another breakfast.”

“There’s something to eat in the provision boxes of the _Ann_,” Sam
replied hopefully.“Yes,” said Jimmie sorrowfully, “and there’s a bunch of angry savages
between us and the grub on board the _Ann_!If you look out the door,
you’ll see the brutes inviting us to come out and be cooked!”

The prisoner threw a startled glance outside and ran to the back of the
temple, declaring that the savages were besieging the temple, and that
it might be necessary for them to lock themselves in the chamber for
days with the slain jaguars!Jimmie rubbed his stomach and groaned!On the morning following the departure of Sam and the boys, Mr.Havens
was awakened by laughing voices in the corridor outside his door.His
first impression was that Sam and Jimmie had returned from their
midnight excursion in the _Ann_.He arose and, after dressing hastily,
opened the door, thinking that the adventures of the night must have
been very amusing indeed to leave such a hang-over of merriment for the
morning.When he saw Ben and Glenn standing in the hall he confessed to a feeling
of disappointment, but invited the lads inside without showing it.“You are out early,” he said as the boys, still laughing, dropped into
chairs.“What’s the occasion of the comedy?”

“We’ve been out to the field,” replied Ben, “and we’re laughing to think
how Carl bested Sam and Jimmie last night.”

“What about it?” asked the millionaire.“Why,” Ben continued, “it seems that Sam and Jimmie planned a moonlight
ride in the _Ann_ all by themselves.Carl got next to their scheme and
bounced into the seat with Jimmie just as the machine swung into the
air.I’ll bet Jimmie was good and provoked about that!”

“What time did the _Ann_ return?” asked Havens.“She hasn’t returned yet.”

The millionaire turned from the mirror in which he was completing the
details of his toilet and faced the boys with a startled look in his
eyes.“Are you sure the boys haven’t returned?” Mr.“Anyhow,” Glenn replied, “the _Ann_ hasn’t come back!”

“Did they tell you where they were going?” asked Ben.“They did not,” was the reply.“Sam said that he thought he might be
able to pick up valuable information and asked for the use of the _Ann_
and the company of Jimmie.That’s all he said to me concerning the
moonlight ride he proposed.”

In bringing his mind back to the conversation with Sam on the previous
night, Mr.Havens could not avoid a feeling of anxiety as he considered
the significant words of the young man and the information concerning
the sealed letter to be opened only in case of his death.He said
nothing of this to the boys, however, but continued the conversation as
if no apprehension dwelt in his mind regarding the safety of the lads.“If they only went out for a short ride by moonlight,” Glenn suggested,
in a moment, “they ought to have returned before daylight.”

“You can never tell what scrape that boy Jimmie will get into!” laughed
Ben.“He’s the hoodoo of the party and the mascot combined!He gets us
into all kinds of scrapes, but he usually makes good by getting us out
of the scrapes we get ourselves into.”

“Oh, they’ll be back directly,” the millionaire remarked, although deep
down in his consciousness was a growing belief that something serious
had happened to the lads.He, however, did his best to conceal the anxiety he felt from Ben and
his companion.Directly the three went down to breakfast together, and while the meal
was in progress a report came from the field where the machines had been
left that numerous telegrams addressed to Mr.“I left positive orders at the telegraph office,” he said, “to have all
my messages delivered here.Did one of the men out there receipt for
them?If so, perhaps one of you boys would better chase out and bring
them in,” he added turning to his companions at the table.The messenger replied that the messages had been receipted for, and that
he had offered to bring them in, but that the man in charge had refused
to turn them over to him.Havens replied, “Ben will go out to the field with you
and bring the messages in.And,” he added, as the messenger turned away,
“kindly notify me the instant the _Ann_ arrives.”

The messenger bowed and started away, accompanied by Ben.“I don’t understand about the telegrams having been sent to the field,”
Mr.Havens went on, as the two left the breakfast table and sauntered
into the lobby of the hotel.I also left instructions
with the clerk to send any messages to my room, no matter what time they
came.The instructions were very explicit.”

“Oh, you know how things get balled up in telegraph offices, and
messenger offices, and post-offices!” grinned Glenn.Mellen left the office early in the evening, and the man in charge got
lazy, or indifferent, or forgetful, and sent the messages to the wrong
place.”

While the two talked together, Mr.Mellen strolled into the hotel and
approached the corner of the lobby where they sat.“Good-morning!” he said taking a chair at their side.“Anything new
concerning the southern trip?”

“Not a thing!” replied Mr.“Sam went out in the _Ann_, for a
short run last night, and we’re only waiting for his return in order to
continue our journey.We expect to be away by noon.”

“I hope I shall hear from you often,” the manager said.“By the way,” the millionaire remarked, “what about the telegrams which
were sent out to the field last night?”

“No telegrams for you were sent out to the field last night!” was the
reply.“The telegrams directed to you are now at the hotel desk, unless
you have called for them.”

“But a messenger from the field reports that several telegrams for me
were received there.I don’t understand this at all.”

“They certainly did not come from our office!” was the reply.The millionaire arose hastily and approached the desk just as the clerk
was drawing a number of telegrams from his letter-box.“I left orders to have these taken to your room as soon as they
arrived,” the clerk explained, “but it seems that the night man chucked
them into your letter-box and forgot all about them.”

Mr.Havens took the telegrams into his hand and returned to the corner
of the lobby where he had been seated with Mellen and Glenn.“There seems to be a hoodoo in the air concerning my telegrams,” he said
with a smile, as he began opening the envelopes.“The messages which
came last night were not delivered to my room, but were left lying in my
letter-box until just now.In future, please instruct your messengers,”
he said to the manager, “to bring my telegrams directly to my room—that
is,” he added, “if I remain in town and any more telegrams are received
for me.”

“I’ll see that you get them directly they are received,” replied the
manager, impatiently.“If the hotel clerk objects to the boy going to
your room in the night-time, I’ll tell him to draw a gun on him!” he
added with a laugh.“Are the delayed telegrams important ones?”

“They are in code!” replied the millionaire.“I’m afraid I’ll have to go
to my room and get the code sheet.”

Mr.Havens disappeared up the elevator, and Mellen and Glenn talked of
aviation, and canoeing, and base-ball, and the dozen and one things in
which men and boys are interested, for half an hour.Then the
millionaire appeared in the lobby beckoning them toward the elevator.Mellen observed that the millionaire was greatly excited as he
motioned them into his suite of rooms and pointed to chairs.The
telegrams which he had received were lying open on a table near the
window and the code sheet and code translations were not far away.Before the millionaire could open the conversation Ben came bounding
into the room without knocking.His face was flushed with running, and
his breath came in short gasps.As he turned to close the door he shook
a clenched fist threateningly in the direction of the elevator.“That fool operator,” he declared, “left me standing in the corridor
below while he took one of the maids up to the ’steenth floor, and I ran
all the way up the stairs!I’ll get him good sometime!”

“Did you bring the telegrams?” asked the millionaire with a smile.“Say, look here!” Ben exclaimed dropping into a chair beside the table.“I’d like to know what’s coming off!”

Mr.Havens and his companions regarded the boy critically for a moment
and then the millionaire asked:

“What’s broke loose now?”

“Well,” Ben went on, “I went out to the field and the man there said
he’d get the telegrams in a minute.I stood around looking over the
_Louise_ and _Bertha_, and asking questions about what Sam said when he
went away on the _Ann_, until I got tired of waiting, then I chased up
to where this fellow stood and he said he’d go right off and get the
messages.”

“Why didn’t you hand him one?” laughed Glenn.“I wanted to,” Ben answered.“If I’d had him down in the old seventeenth
ward in the little old city of New York, I’d have set the bunch on him.Well, after a while, he poked away to the little shelter-tent the men
put up to sleep in last night and rustled around among the straw and
blankets and came back and said he couldn’t find the messages.”

The millionaire and the manager exchanged significant glances.“He told me,” Ben went on, “that the telegrams had been receipted for
and hidden under a blanket, to be delivered early in the morning.Said
he guessed some one must have stolen them, or mislaid them, but didn’t
seem to think the matter very important.”

The millionaire pointed to the open messages lying on the table.“How many telegrams came for me last night?” he asked.“Eight,” was the reply.“And there are eight here,” the millionaire went on.“And that means——”

“And that means,” the millionaire said, interrupting the manager, “that
the telegrams delivered on the field last night were either duplicates
of these cipher despatches or fake messages!”

“That’s just what I was going to remark,” said Mellen.“Has the _Ann_ returned?” asked Glenn of Ben.“Not yet,” was the reply.“Suppose we take one of the other machines and go up and look for her?”

“We’ll discuss that later on, boys,” the millionaire interrupted.“I would give a considerable to know,” the manager observed, in a
moment, “just who handled the messages which were left at the hotel
counter last night.And I’m going to do my best to find out!” he added.“That ought to be a perfectly simple matter,” suggested Mr.In Quito, no!” answered the manager.“A good many of
the natives who are in clerical positions here are crooked enough to
live in a corkscrew.They’ll do almost anything for money.”

“That’s the idea I had already formed of the people,” Ben cut in.“Besides,” the manager continued, “the chances are that the night clerk
tumbled down on a sofa somewhere in the lobby and slept most of the
night, leaving bell-boys and subordinates to run the hotel.”

“In that event,” Mr.Havens said, “the telegrams might have been handled
by half a dozen different people.”

“I’m afraid so!” replied the manager.“But the code!” suggested Ben.“They couldn’t read them!”

“But they might copy them for some one who could!” argued the manager.“And the copies might have been sent out to the field for the express
purpose of having them stolen,” he went on with an anxious look on his
face.“Are they very important?” he asked of the millionaire.“Very much so,” was the answer.“In fact, they are code copies of
private papers taken from deposit box A, showing the plans made in New
York for the South American aeroplane journey.”

“And showing stops and places to look through and all that?” asked Ben.“If that’s the kind of information the telegrams contained, I guess the
Redfern bunch in this vicinity are pretty well posted about this time!”

“I’m afraid so,” the millionaire replied gloomily.“Well,” he continued
in a moment, “we may as well get ready for our journey.I remember now,”
he said casually, “that Sam said last night that we ought to proceed on
our way without reference to him this morning.His idea then was that we
would come up with him somewhere between Quito and Lake Titicaca.So we
may as well be moving, and leave the investigation of the fraudulent or
copied telegrams to Mr.Mellen.”

“Funny thing for them to go chasing off in that way!” declared Ben.But no one guessed the future as the aeroplanes started southward!JIMMIE’S AWFUL HUNGER.“You say,” Sam asked, as Pedro crouched in the corner of the temple
where the old fountain basin had been, “that the Indians will never
actually attack the temple?”

“They never have,” replied Pedro, his teeth chattering in terror.“Since
I have been stationed here to feed and care for the wild animals in
captivity, I have known them to utter threats, but until to-night, so
far as I know, none of them ever placed a foot on the temple steps.”

“They did it to-night, all right!” Jimmie declared.“Felix could tell us about that if they had left enough of his frame to
utter a sound!” Carl put in.The boys were both weak from loss of blood, but their injuries were not
of a character to render them incapable of moving about.“What I’m afraid of,” Pedro went on, “is that they’ll surround the
temple and try to starve us into submission.”

“Jerusalem!” cried Jimmie.“That doesn’t sound good to me.I’m so hungry
now I could eat one of those jaguars raw!”

“But they are not fit to eat!” exclaimed Pedro.“They wanted to eat us, didn’t they?” demanded Jimmie.“I guess turn and
turn about is fair play!”

“Is there no secret way out of this place?” asked Sam, as the howls of
the savages became more imperative.There were rumors, he said, of secret
passages, but he had never been able to discover them.For his own part,
he did not believe they existed.“What sort of a hole is that den the jaguars came out of?” asked Jimmie.“It looks like it might extend a long way into the earth.”

“No,” answered Pedro, “it is only a subterranean room, used a thousand
years ago by the priests who performed at the broken altar you see
beyond the fountain.When the Gringoes came with their proposition to
hold wild animals here until they could be taken out to Caxamarca, and
thence down the railroad to the coast, they examined the walls of the
chamber closely, but found no opening by which the wild beasts might
escape.Therefore, I say, there is no passage leading from that
chamber.”

“From the looks of things,” Carl said, glancing out at the Indians, now
swarming by the score on the level plateau between the front of the
ruined temple and the lake, “we’ll have plenty of time to investigate
this old temple before we get out of it.”

“How are we going to investigate anything when we’re hungry?” demanded
Jimmie.“I can’t even think when I’m hungry.”

“Take away Jimmie’s appetite,” grinned Carl, “and there wouldn’t be
enough left of him to fill an ounce bottle!”

Pedro still sat in the basin of the old fountain, rocking his body back
and forth and wailing in a mixture of Spanish and English that he was
the most unfortunate man who ever drew the breath of life.“The animal industry,” he wailed, “is ruined.No more will the hunters
of wild beasts bring them to this place for safe keeping.No more will
the Indians assist in their capture.No more will the gold of the Gringo
kiss my palm.The ships came out of the sky and brought ruin.Right the
Indians are when they declare that the men who fly bring only disease
and disaster!” he continued, with an angry glance directed at the boys.“Cheer up!” laughed Jimmie.“Cheer up, old top, and remember that the
worst is yet to come!Say!” the boy added in a moment.“How would it do
to step out to the entrance and shoot a couple of those noisy savages?”

“I never learned how to shoot with an empty gun!” Carl said scornfully.“How many cartridges have you in your gun?” asked Jimmie of Sam.“About six,” was the reply.“I used two out of the clip on the jaguars
and two were fired on the ride to Quito.”

“And that’s all the ammunition we’ve got, is it?” demanded Carl.“That’s all we’ve got here!” answered Sam.“There’s plenty more at the
machine if the Indians haven’t taken possession of it.”

“Little good that does us!” growled Jimmie.“You couldn’t eat ’em!” laughed Carl.“But I’ll tell you what I could do!” insisted Jimmie.“If we had plenty
of ammunition, I could make a sneak outside and bring in game enough to
keep us eating for a month.”

“You know what always happens to you when you go out after something to
eat!” laughed Carl.“You always get into trouble!”

“But I always get back, don’t I?” demanded Jimmie.“I guess the time
will come, before long, when you’ll be glad to see me starting out for
some kind of game!We’re not going to remain quietly here and starve.”

“That looks like going out hunting,” said Sam, pointing to the savages
outside.“Those fellows might have something to say about it.”

It was now broad daylight.The early sunshine lay like a mist of gold
over the tops of the distant peaks, and birds were cutting the clear,
sweet air with their sharp cries.Many of the Indians outside being sun
worshipers, the boys saw them still on their knees with hands and face
uplifted to the sunrise.The air in the valley was growing warmer every minute.By noon, when the
sun would look almost vertically down, it promised to be very hot, as
the mountains shut out the breeze.“I don’t think it will be necessary to look for game,” Sam went on in a
moment, “for the reason that the _Louise_ and _Bertha_, ought to be here
soon after sunset.It may possibly take them a little longer than that
to cover the distance, as they do not sail so fast as the _Ann_, but at
least they should be here before to-morrow morning.Then you’ll see the
savages scatter!” he added with a smile.“And you’ll see Jimmie eat,
too!”

“Don’t mention it!” cried the boy.“Yes,” Carl suggested, “but won’t Mr.Havens and the boys remain in
Quito two or three days waiting for us to come back?”

“I think not,” was the reply.Havens to pick us up
somewhere between Quito and Lake Titicaca in case we did not return
before morning.I have an idea that they’ll start out sometime during
the forenoon—say ten o’clock—and reach this point, at the latest, by
midnight.”

“They can’t begin to sail as fast as we did!” suggested Carl.“If they make forty miles an hour,” Sam explained, “and stop only three
or four times to rest, they can get here before midnight, all right!”

“Gee!That’s a long time to go without eating!” cried Jimmie.“And, even
at that,” he went on in a moment, “they may shoot over us like a couple
of express trains, and go on south without ever knowing we are here.”

Sam turned to Pedro with an inquiring look on his face.“Where is Miguel?” he asked.“Gone!” he said.“Well, then,” Sam went on, “what about the red and blue lights?Can you
stage that little drama for us to-night?”

“What is stage?” demanded Pedro.“I don’t know what you mean.”

“Chestnuts!” exclaimed Jimmie impatiently.“He wants to know if you can
work the lights as Miguel did.He wants to know if you can keep the
lights burning to-night in order to attract the attention of people who
are coming to drive the Indians away.Do you get it?”

Pedro’s face brightened perceptibly.“Coming to drive the Indians away?” he repeated.“Yes, I can burn the
lights.They shall burn from the going down of the sun.Also,” he added
with a hopeful expression on his face, “the Indians may see the lights
and disappear again in the forest.”

“Yes, they will!” laughed Carl.“Let him think so if he wants to,” cautioned Jimmie.“He’ll take better
care of the lights if he thinks that will in any way add to the
possibility of release.But midnight!” the boy went on.“Think of all
that time without anything to eat!Say,” he whispered to Carl, in a soft
aside, “if you can get Sam asleep sometime during the day and get the
gun away from him, I’m going to make a break for the tall timber and
bring in a deer, or a brace of rabbits, or something of that kind.There’s plenty of cooking utensils in that other chamber and plenty of
dishes, so we can have a mountain stew with very little trouble if we
can only get the meat to put into it.”

“And there’s the stew they left,” suggested Carl.“Not for me!” Jimmie answered.“I’m not going to take any chances on
being poisoned.I’d rather build a fire on that dizzy old hearth they
used, and broil a steak from one of the jaguars than eat that stew—or
anything they left for that matter.”

“I don’t believe you can get out into the hills,” objected Carl.“I can try,” Jimmie suggested, “if I can only get that gun away from
Sam.Look here,” he went
on, “suppose I fix up in the long, flowing robe, and dig up the wigs and
things Miguel must have worn, and walk in a dignified manner between the
ranks of the Indians?What do you know about that?”

“That would probably be all right,” Carl answered, “until you began
shooting game, and then they’d just naturally put you into a stew.They
know very well that gods in white robes don’t have to kill game in order
to sustain life.”

“Oh, why didn’t you let me dream?” demanded Jimmie.“I was just figuring
how I could get about four gallons of stew.”

Abandoning the cherished hope of getting out into the forest for the
time being, Jimmie now approached Pedro and began asking him questions
concerning his own stock of provisions.“According to your own account,” the boy said, “you’ve been living here
right along for some weeks, taking care of the wild animals as the
collectors brought them in.Now you must have plenty of provisions
stored away somewhere.Dig ’em up!”

Pedro declared that there were no provisions at all about the place,
adding that everything had been consumed the previous day except the
remnants left in the living chamber.He said, however, that he expected
provisions to be brought in by his two companions within two days.In
the meantime, he had arranged on such wild game as he could bring down.Abandoning another hope, Jimmie passed through the narrow passage and
into the chamber where he had come so near to death.The round eye of
his searchlight revealed the jaguars still lying on the marble floor.The roof above this chamber appeared to be comparatively whole, yet here
and there the warm sunlight streamed in through minute crevices between
the slabs.The boy crossed the chamber, not without a little shiver of
terror at the thought of the dangers he had met there, and peered into
the mouth of the den from which the wild beasts had made their
appearance.The odor emanating from the room beyond was not at all pleasant, but,
resolving to see for himself what the place contained, he pushed on and
soon stood in a subterranean room hardly more than twelve feet square.There were six steps leading down into the chamber, and these seemed to
the boy to be worn and polished smooth as if from long use.“It’s a bet!” the lad chuckled, as he crawled through the opening and
slid cautiously down the steps, “that this stairway was used a hundred
times a day while the old priests lived here.In that case,” he argued,
“there must have been some reason for constant use of the room.And all
this,” he went on, “leads me to the conclusion that the old fellows had
a secret way out of the temple and that it opens from this very room.”

While the boy stood at the bottom of the steps flashing his light around
the confined space, Carl’s figure appeared into the opening above.“What have you found?” the latter asked.“Nothing yet but bad air and stone walls!” replied Jimmie.“What are you looking for?” was the next question.“A way out!” answered Jimmie.Carl came down the steps and the two boys examined the chamber carefully
for some evidence of a hidden exit.They were about to abandon the quest
when Jimmie struck the handle of his pocket knife, which he had been
using in the investigation, against a stone which gave back a hollow
sound.“Here you are!” Jimmie cried.“There’s a hole back of that stone.If we
can only get it out, we’ll kiss the savages ‘good-bye’ and get back to
the _Ann_ in quick time.”

The boys pried and pounded at the stone until at last it gave way under
pressure and fell backward with a crash.“There!” Jimmie shouted.“I knew it!”




                              CHAPTER XIX.“Yes, you knew it all right!” Carl exclaimed, as the boy stood looking
into the dark passage revealed by the falling of the stone.“You always
know a lot of things just after they occur!”

“Anyway,” Jimmie answered with a grin, “I knew there ought to be a
secret passage somewhere.Where do you suppose the old thing leads to?”

“For one thing,” Carl answered, “it probably leads under the great stone
slab in front of the entrance, because when Miguel, the foxy boy with
the red and blue lights, disappeared he went down into the ground right
there.And I’ll bet,” he went on, “that it runs out to the rocky
elevation to the west and connects with the forest near where the
machine is.”

“Those old chaps must have burrowed like rabbits!” declared Jimmie.“Don’t you think the men who operated the temples ever carried the
stones which weigh a hundred tons or cut passages through solid rocks!”
Carl declared.“They worked the Indians for all that part of the game,
just as the Egyptians worked the Hebrews on the lower Nile.”

“Well, the only way to find out where it goes,” Jimmie suggested, “is to
follow it.We can’t stand here and guess it out.”

“Indeed we can’t,” agreed Carl.“I’ll go on down the incline and you
follow along.Looks pretty slippery here, so we’d better keep close
together.I don’t suppose we can put the stone back,” he added with a
parting glance into the chamber.“What would we want to put it back for?” demanded Jimmie.“How do we know who will be snooping around here while we are under
ground?” Carl asked impatiently.“If some one should come along here and
stuff the stone back into the hole and we shouldn’t be able to find any
exit, we’d be in a nice little tight box, wouldn’t we?”

“Well, if we can’t lift it back into the hole,” Jimmie argued, “I guess
we can push it along in front of us.This incline seems slippery enough
to pass it along like a sleighload of girls on a snowy hill.”

The boys concentrated their strength, which was not very great at that
time because of their wounds, on the stone and were soon gratified to
see it sliding swiftly out of sight along a dark incline.“I wonder what Sam will say?” asked Jimmie.“He won’t know anything about it!” Carl declared.“Oh, yes, he will!” asserted Jimmie, “he’ll be looking around before
we’ve been absent ten minutes.Perhaps we’d ought to go back and tell
him what we’ve found, and what we’re going to do.”

“Then he’d want to go with us,” Carl suggested, “and that would leave
the savages to sneak into the temple whenever they find the nerve to do
so, and also leave Pedro to work any old tricks he saw fit.Besides,”
the boy went on, “we won’t be gone more than ten minutes.”

“You’re always making a sneak on somebody,” grinned Jimmie.“You had to
go and climb up on our machine last night, and get mixed up in all this
trouble.You’re always doing something of the kind!”

“I guess you’re glad I stuck around, ain’t you?” laughed Carl.“You’d
’a’ had a nice time in that den of lions without my gun, eh?”

“Well, get a move on!” laughed Jimmie.“And hang on to the walls as you
go ahead.This floor looks like one of the chutes under the newspaper
offices in New York.And hold your light straight ahead.”

The incline extended only a few yards.Arrived at the bottom, the boys
estimated that the top of the six-foot passage was not more than a
couple of yards from the surface of the earth.Much to their surprise
they found the air in the place remarkably pure.At the bottom of the incline the passage turned away to the north for a
few paces, then struck out west.From this angle the boys could see
little fingers of light which probably penetrated into the passage from
crevices in the steps of the temple.Gaining the front of the old structure, they saw that one of the stones
just below the steps was hung on a rude though perfectly reliable hinge,
and that a steel rod attached to it operated a mechanism which placed
the slab entirely under the control of any one mounting the steps, if
acquainted with the secret of the door.“Here’s where Miguel drops down!” laughed Jimmie, his searchlight prying
into the details of the cunning device.“Well, well!” he went on, “those
old Incas certainly took good care of their precious carcasses.It’s a
pity they couldn’t have coaxed the Spaniards into some of their secret
passages and then sealed them up!”

The passage ran on to the west after passing the temple for some
distance, and then turned abruptly to the north.The lights showed a
long, tunnel-like place, apparently cut in the solid rock.“I wonder if this tunnel leads to the woods we saw at the west of the
cove,” Carl asked.“I hope it does!” he added, “for then we can get to
the machine and get something to eat and get some ammunition and,” he
added hopefully, “we may be able to get away in the jolly old _Ann_ and
leave the Indians watching an empty temple.”

“Do you suppose Miguel came into this passage when he dropped out of
sight in front of the temple?” asked Jimmie.“Of course, he did!”

“Then where did he go?”

“Why, back into the temple.”

“Through the den of lions?I guess not!”

“That’s a fact!” exclaimed Carl.“He wouldn’t go through the den of
lions, would he?And he never could have traveled this passage to the
end and hiked back over the country in time to drop the gate and lift
the bars in front of the den!It was Miguel that did that, wasn’t it?”
the boy added, turning enquiringly to his chum.“It must have been for
there was no one else there.”

“What are you getting at?” asked Jimmie.“There must be a passage leading from this one
back into the temple on the west side.It may enter the room where the
bunks are, or it may come into the corridor back by the fountain, but
there’s one somewhere all right.”

“You’re the wise little boy!” laughed Jimmie.“Let’s go and see.”

The boys returned to the trap-like slab in front of the temple and from
that point examined every inch of the south wall for a long distance.Finally a push on a stone brought forth a grinding noise, and then a
passage similar to that discovered in the den was revealed.“There you are!” said Carl.“There’s the passage that leads to the west
side of the temple.Shall we go on in and give Sam and Pedro the merry
ha, ha?Mighty funny,” he added, without waiting for his question to be
answered, “that all these trap doors are so easily found and work so
readily.They’re just about as easy to manipulate as one of the foolish
houses we see on the stage.It’s no trick to operate them at all.”

“Well,” Jimmie argued, “these passages and traps are doubtless used
every day by a man who don’t take any precautions about keeping them
hidden.I presume Miguel is the only person here who knows of their
existence, and he just slams around in them sort of careless-like.”

“That’s the answer!” replied Carl.“Let’s chase along and see where the
tunnel ends, and then get back to Sam.He may be crying his eyes out for
our polite society right now!”

The boys followed the tunnel for what seemed to them to be a long
distance.At length they came to a turn from which a mist of daylight
could be seen.In five minutes more they stood looking out into the
forest.The entrance to the passage was concealed only by carelessly heaped-up
rocks, between the interstices of which grew creeping vines and
brambles.Looking from the forest side, the place resembled a heap of
rocks, probably inhabited by all manner of creeping things and covered
over with vines.As the boys peered out between the vines, Jimmie nudged his chum in the
side and whispered as he pointed straight out:

“There’s the _Ann_.”

“But that isn’t where we left her!” argued Carl.“Well, it’s the _Ann_, just the same, isn’t it?”

“I suppose so,” was the reply.“I presume,” the boy went on, “the
Indians moved it to the place where it now is.”

“Don’t you ever think they did!” answered Jimmie.“The Indians wouldn’t
touch it with a pair of tongs!Felix and Pedro probably moved it, the
idea being to hide it from view.”

“I guess that’s right!” Carl agreed.“I’m going out,” he continued, in a
moment, “and see if I can find any savages.I won’t be gone very long.”

“What you mean,” Jimmie grinned, “is that you’re going out to see if you
won’t find any savages.That is,” he went on, “you think of going out.As a matter of fact, I’m the one that’s going out, because the wild
beasts chewed you up proper, and they didn’t hurt me at all.”

The boy crowded past Carl as he spoke and dodged out into the forest.Carl waited impatiently for ten minutes and was on the point of going in
quest of the boy when Jimmie came leisurely up to the curtain of vines
which hid the passage and looked in with a grin on his freckled face.“Come on out,” he said, “the air is fine!”

“Any savages?” asked Carl.“Not a savage!”

“Anything to eat?” demanded the boy.“Bales of it!” answered Jimmie.“The savages never touched the _Ann_.”

Carl crept out of the opening and made his way to where Jimmie sat flat
on the bole of a fallen tree eating ham sandwiches.“Are there any left?” he asked.“Half a bushel!”

“Then perhaps the others stand some chance of getting one or two.”

“There’s more than we can all eat before to-morrow morning,” Jimmie
answered.“And if the relief train doesn’t come before that time we’ll
mount the _Ann_ and glide away.”

While the boys sat eating their sandwiches and enjoying the clear sweet
air of the morning, there came an especially savage chorus of yells from
the direction of the temple.“The Indians seem to be a mighty enthusiastic race!” declared Jimmie.“Suppose we go to the _Ann_, grab the provisions, and go back to the
temple just to see what they’re amusing themselves with now!”

This suggestion meeting with favor, the boys proceeded to the aeroplane
which was only a short distance away and loaded themselves down with
provisions and cartridges.During their journey they saw not the
slightest indications of the Indians.It was quite evident that they
were all occupied with the _siege_ of the temple.On leaving the entrance, the boys restored the vines so far as possible
to their original condition and filled their automatics with cartridges.“No one will ever catch me without cartridges again,” Carl declared as
he patted his weapon.“The idea of getting into a den of lions with only
four shots between us and destruction!”

“Well, hurry up!” cried Jimmie.“I know from the accent the Indians
placed on the last syllable that there’s something doing at the temple.And Sam, you know, hasn’t got many cartridges.”

“I wouldn’t run very fast,” declared Carl, “if I knew that the Indians
had captured Miguel.That’s the ruffian who shut us into the den of
lions!”

When the boys came to the passage opening from the tunnel on the west of
the temple, they turned into it and proceeded a few yards south.Here
they found an opening which led undoubtedly directly to the rear of the
corridor in the vicinity of the fountain.The stone which had in past years concealed the mouth of this passage
had evidently not been used for a long time, for it lay broken into
fragments on the stone floor.When the boys came to the end of the passage, they saw by the slices of
light which lay between the stones that they were facing the corridor
from the rear.They knew well enough that somewhere in that vicinity was
a door opening into the temple, but for some moments they could not find
it.At last Jimmie, prying into a crack with his knife, struck a piece
of metal and the stone dropped backward.He was about to crawl through into the corridor when Carl caught him by
one leg and held him back.It took the lad only an instant to comprehend
what was going on.A horde of savages was crowding up the steps and into
the temple itself, and Sam stood in the middle of the corridor with a
smoking weapon in his hand.As the boys looked he threw the automatic into the faces of the
onrushing crowd as if its usefulness had departed.THE SAVAGES MAKE MORE TROUBLE.“Pedro said the savages wouldn’t dare enter the temple!” declared Jimmie
as he drew back.Without stopping to comment on the situation, Carl called out:

“Drop, Sam, drop!”

The young man whirled about, saw the opening in the rear wall, saw the
brown barrels of the automatics, and instantly dropped to the floor.The
Indians advanced no farther, for in less time than it takes to say the
words a rain of bullets struck into their ranks.Half a dozen fell to
the floor and the others retreated, sneaking back in a minute, however,
to remove the bodies of their dead and wounded companions.The boys did not fire while this duty was being performed.In a minute from the time of the opening of the stone panel in the wall
there was not a savage in sight.Only for the smears of blood on the
white marble floor, and on the steps outside, no one would have imagined
that so great a tragedy had been enacted there only a few moments
before.Sam rose slowly to his feet and stood by the boys as they
crawled out of the narrow opening just above the basin of the fountain.“I’m glad to see you, kids,” he said, in a matter-of-fact tone, although
his face was white to the lips.“You came just in time!”

“We usually do arrive on schedule,” Jimmie grinned, trying to make as
little as possible of the rescue.“You did this time at any rate!” replied Sam.“But, look here,” he went
on, glancing at the automatics in their hands, “I thought the ammunition
was all used up in the den of lions.”

“We got some more!” laughed Carl.“More—where?”

“At the _Ann_!”

Sam leaned back against the wall, a picture of amazement.“You haven’t been out to the _Ann_ have you?” he asked.For reply Jimmie drew a great package of sandwiches and another of
cartridges out of the opening in the wall.“We haven’t, eh?” he laughed.“That certainly looks like it!” declared Sam.The boys briefly related the story of their visit to the aeroplane while
Sam busied himself with the sandwiches, and then they loaded the three
automatics and distributed the remaining clips about their persons.“And now what?” asked Carl, after the completion of the recital.“Are we going to take the _Ann_ and slip away from these worshipers of
the Sun?” asked Jimmie.“We can do it all right!”

“I don’t know about that,” argued Sam.“You drove them away from the
temple, and the chances are that they will return to the forest and will
remain there until they get the courage to make another attack on us.”

“It won’t take long to go and find out whether they are in the forest or
not!” Carl declared.“Perhaps,” Sam suggested, “we’d better wait here for the others to come
up.They ought to be here to-night.”

“If it’s a sure thing that we can let them know where we are,” Carl
agreed, “that might be all right.”

“What’s the matter with the red and blue lights?” asked Jimmie.“By the way,” Carl inquired looking about the place, “where is Pedro?”

“He took to his heels when the savages made the rush.”

“Which way did he go?” asked Jimmie.“I think he went in the direction of that little menagerie you boys
found last night!” replied Sam.“Then I’ll bet he knows where the tunnel is!” Carl shouted, dashing
away.“I’ll bet he’s lit out for the purpose of bringing a lot of his
conspirators in here to do us up!”

Jimmie followed his chum, and the two searched the entire system of
tunnels known to them without discovering any trace of the missing man.“That’s a nice thing!” Jimmie declared.“We probably passed him
somewhere on our way back to the temple.By this time he’s off over the
hills, making signals for some one to come and help put us to the bad.”

“I’m afraid you’re right!” replied Sam.The boys ate their sandwiches and discussed plans and prospects,
listening in the meantime for indications of the two missing men.Several times they thought they heard soft footsteps in the apartments
opening from the corridor, but in each case investigation revealed
nothing.It was a long afternoon, but finally the sun disappeared over the ridge
to the west of the little lake and the boys began considering the
advisability of making ready to signal to the _Louise_ and _Bertha_.“They will surely be here?” said Carl hopefully.“I am certain of it!” answered Sam.“Then we’d better be getting something on top of the temple to make a
light,” advised Jimmie.“If I had Miguel by the neck, he’d bring out his
red and blue lights before he took another breath!” he added.“Perhaps we can find the lights,” suggested Sam.This idea being very much to the point, the boys scattered themselves
over the three apartments and searched diligently for the lamps or
candles which had been used by Miguel on the previous night.“Nothing doing!” Jimmie declared, returning to the corridor.“Nothing doing!” echoed Carl, coming in from the other way.Sam joined the group in a moment looking very much discouraged.“Boys,” he said, “I’ve been broke in nearly all the large cities on both
Western continents.I’ve been kicked out of lodging houses, and I’ve
walked hundreds of miles with broken shoes and little to eat, but of all
the everlasting, consarned, ridiculous, propositions I ever butted up
against, this is the worst!”

The boys chuckled softly but made no reply.“We know well enough,” he went on, “that there are rockets, or lamps, or
torches, or candles, enough hidden about this place to signal all the
transcontinental trains in the world but we can’t find enough of them to
flag a hand-car on an uphill grade!”

“What’s the matter with the searchlights?” asked Jimmie.“Not sufficiently strong!”

Without any explanation, Jimmie darted away from the group and began a
tour of the temple.First he walked along the walls of the corridor then
darted to the other room, then out on the steps in front.“His trouble has turned his head!” jeered Carl.“Look here, you fellows!” Jimmie answered darting back into the temple.“There’s a great white rock on the cliff back of the temple.It looks
like one of these memorial stones aldermen put their names on when they
build a city hall.All we have to do to signal the aeroplanes is to put
red caps over our searchlights and turn them on that cliff.They will
make a circle of fire there that will look like the round, red face of a
harvest moon.”

“That’s right!” agreed Carl.“A very good idea!” Sam added.“I’ve been trying to find a way to get up on the roof,” Jimmie
continued, “but can’t find one.You see,” he went on, “we can operate
our searchlights better from the top of the temple.”

“We’ll have to find a way to get up there!” Sam insisted.“Unless we can make the illumination on the cliff through the hole in
the roof,” Jimmie proposed.“And that’s another good proposition!” Sam agreed.“And so,” laughed Carl, “the stage is set and the actors are in the
wings, and I’m going to crawl into one of the bunks in the west room and
go to sleep.”

“You go, too, Jimmie,” Sam advised.“I’ll wake you up if anything
happens.I can get my rest later on.”

The boys were not slow in accepting the invitation, and in a very short
time were sound asleep.It would be time for the _Bertha_ and _Louise_
to show directly, and so Sam placed the red caps over the lamps of two
of the electrics and sat where he could throw the rays through the break
in the roof.Curious to know if the result was exactly as he
anticipated, he finally propped one of the lights in position on the
floor and went out to the entrance to look up at the rock.As he stepped out on the smooth slab of marble in front of the entrance
something whizzed within an inch of his head and dropped with a crash on
the stones below.Without stopping to investigate the young man dodged
into the temple again and looked out.“Now, I wonder,” he thought, as he lifted the electric so that its red
light struck the smooth face of the rock above more directly, “whether
that kind remembrance was from our esteemed friends Pedro and Miguel, or
whether it came from the Indians.”

He listened intently for a moment and presently heard the sound of
shuffling feet from above.It was apparent that the remainder of the
evening was not to be as peaceful and quiet as he had anticipated.Realizing that the hostile person or persons on the roof might in a
moment begin dropping their rocks down to the floor of the corridor, he
passed hastily into the west chamber and stood by the doorway looking
out.This interference, he understood, would effectually prevent any
illumination of the white rock calculated to serve as a signal to Mr.Some other means of attracting their attention must
be devised.The corridor lay dim in the faint light of the stars which
came through the break in the roof, and he threw the light of his
electric up and down the stone floor in order to make sure that the
enemy was not actually creeping into the temple from the entrance.While he stood flashing the light about he almost uttered an exclamation
of fright as a grating sound in the vicinity of the fountain came to his
ears.He cast his light in that direction and saw the stone which had
been replaced by the boys retreating slowly into the wall.Then a dusky face looked out of the opening, and, without considering
the ultimate consequences of his act, he fired full at the threatening
eyes which were searching the interior.There was a groan, a fall, and
the stone moved back to its former position.He turned to awaken Jimmie and Carl but the sound of the shot had
already accomplished that, and the boys were standing in the middle of
the floor with automatics in their hands.“What’s coming off?” asked Jimmie.“Was that thunder?” demanded Carl.“Thunder don’t smell like that,” suggested Jimmie, sniffing at the
powder smoke.“I guess Sam has been having company.”

“Right you are,” said Sam, doing his best to keep the note of
apprehension out of his voice.“Our friends are now occupying the tunnel
you told me about.At least one of them was, not long ago.”

“Now, see here,” Jimmie broke in, “I’m getting tired of this
hide-and-seek business around this blooming old ruin.We came out to
sail in the air, and not crawl like snakes through underground
passages.”

“What’s the answer?” asked Carl.“According to Sam’s story,” Jimmie went on, “we won’t be able to signal
our friends with our red lights to-night.In that case, they’re likely
to fly by, on their way south, without discovering our whereabouts.”

“And so you want to go back to the machine, eh?” Sam questioned.“That’s the idea,” answered Jimmie.“I want to get up into God’s free
air again, where I can see the stars, and the snow caps on the
mountains!I want to build a roaring old fire on some shelf of rock and
build up a stew big enough for a regiment of state troops!Then I want
to roll up in a blanket and sleep for about a week.”

“That’s me, too!” declared Carl.“It may not be possible to get to the machine,” suggested Sam.“I’ll let you know in about five minutes!” exclaimed Jimmie darting
recklessly across the corridor and into the chamber which had by mutual
consent been named the den of lions.Sam called to him to return but the boy paid no heed to the warning.“Come on!” Carl urged the next moment.“We’ve got to go with him.”

Sam seized a package of sandwiches which lay on the roughly constructed
table and darted with the boy across the corridor, through the east
chamber, into the subterranean one, and passed into the tunnel, the
entrance to which, it will be remembered, had been left open.Some distance down in the darkness, probably where the passage swung
away to the north, they saw a glimmer of light.Directly they heard
Jimmie’s voice calling softly through the odorous darkness.“Come on!” he whispered.“We may as well get out to the woods and see
what’s doing there.”

The two half-walked, half-stumbled, down the slippery incline and joined
Jimmie at the bottom.“Now we want to look out,” the boy said as they came to the angle which
faced the west.“There may be some of those rude persons in the tunnel
ahead of us.”

Not caring to proceed in the darkness, they kept their lights burning as
they advanced.When they came to the cross passage which led to the rear
of the corridor they listened for an instant and thought they detected a
low murmur of voices in the distance.“Let’s investigate!” suggested Carl.“Investigate nothing!” replied Jimmie.“Let’s move for the machine and
the level of the stars.If the savages are there, we’ll chase ’em out.”

But the savages were not there.When the three came to the curtain of
vines which concealed the entrance to the passage, the forest seemed as
still as it had been on the day of creation.They moved out of the tangle and crept forward to the aeroplane, their
lights now out entirely, and their automatics ready for use.They were
soon at the side of the machine.After as good an examination as could possibly be made in the
semi-darkness, Sam declared that nothing had been molested, and that the
_Ann_ was, apparently, in as good condition for flight as it had been at
the moment of landing.“Why didn’t we do this in the afternoon, while the <DW65>s were out of
sight?” asked Carl in disgust.“Sam said we couldn’t!” grinned Jimmie.“Anyhow,” Sam declared, “we’re going to see right now whether we can or
not.We’ll have to push the old bird out into a clear place first,
though!”

Here the talk was interrupted by a chorus of savage shouts.The _Louise_ and the _Bertha_ left the field near Quito amid the shouts
of a vast crowd which gathered in the early part of the day.As the
aeroplanes sailed majestically into the air, Mr.Havens saw Mellen
sitting in a motor-car waving a white handkerchief in farewell.The millionaire and Ben rode in the _Louise_, while Glenn followed in
the _Bertha_.For a few moments the clatter of the motors precluded
conversation, then the aviator slowed down a trifle and asked his
companion:

“Was anything seen of Doran to-day?”

Ben shook his head.“I half believe,” Mr.Havens continued, “that the code despatches were
stolen by him last night from the hotel, copied, and the copies sent out
to the field to be delivered to some one of the conspirators.”

“But no one could translate them,” suggested Ben.“I’m not so sure of that,” was the reply.“The code is by no means a new
one.I have often reproached myself for not changing it after Redfern
disappeared with the money.”

“If it’s the same code you used then,” Ben argued, “you may be sure
there is some one of the conspirators who can do the translating.Why,”
he went on, “there must be.They wouldn’t have stolen code despatches
unless they knew how to read them.”

“In that case,” smiled Mr.Havens grimly, “they have actually secured
the information they desire from the men they are fighting.”

“Were the messages important?” asked Ben.“Duplicates of papers contained in deposit box A,” was the answer.“What can they learn from them?”

“The route mapped out for our journey south!” was the reply.“Including
the names of places where Redfern may be in hiding.”

“And so they’ll be apt to guard all those points?” asked Ben.As the reader will understand, one point, that at the ruined temple, had
been very well guarded indeed!“Yes,” replied the millionaire.“They are likely to look out for us at
all the places mentioned in the code despatches.”

Ben gave a low whistle of dismay, and directly the motors were pushing
the machine forward at the rate of fifty or more miles an hour.The aviators stopped on a level plateau about the middle of the
afternoon to prepare dinner, and then swept on again.At nightfall, they
were in the vicinity of a summit which lifted like a cone from a
circular shelf of rock which almost completely surrounded it.The millionaire aviator encircled the peak and finally decided that a
landing might be made with safety.He dropped the _Louise_ down very
slowly and was gratified to find that there would be little difficulty
in finding a resting-place below.As soon as he landed he turned his
eyes toward the _Bertha_, still circling above.The machine seemed to be coming steadily toward the shelf, but as he
looked the great planes wavered and tipped, and when the aeroplane
actually landed it was with a crash which threw Glenn from his seat and
brought about a great rattling of machinery.Glenn arose from the rock wiping blood from his face.“I’m afraid that’s the end of the _Bertha_!” he exclaimed.“I hope not,” replied Ben.“I think a lot of that old machine.”

Mr.Havens, after learning that Glenn’s injuries were not serious,
hastened over to the aeroplane and began a careful examination of the
motors.“I think,” he said in a serious tone, “that the threads on one of the
turn-buckles on one of the guy wires stripped so as to render the planes
unmanageable.”

“They were unmanageable, all right!” Glenn said, rubbing the sore spots
on his knees.“Can we fix it right here?” Ben asked.“That depends on whether we have a supply of turn-buckles,” replied
Havens.“They certainly ought to be in stock somewhere.”

“Glory be!” cried Glenn.“We sure have plenty of turn-buckles!”

“Get one out, then,” the millionaire directed, “and we’ll see what we
can do with it.”

The boys hunted everywhere in the tool boxes of both machines without
finding what they sought.“I know where they are!” said Glenn glumly in a moment.“Then get one out!” advised Ben.“They’re on the _Ann_!” explained Glenn.“If you remember we put the
spark plugs and a few other things of that sort on the _Louise_ and put
the turn-buckles on the _Ann_.”

“Now, you wait a minute,” Mr.“Perhaps I can use the old
turn-buckle on the sharp threads of the _Louise_ and put the one which
belongs there in the place of this worn one.Sometimes a transfer of
that kind can be made to work in emergencies.”

“That’ll be fine!” exclaimed Ben.I’ll hold the light while you take the buckle off the _Louise_.”

Ben turned his flashlight on the guy wires and the aviator began turning
the buckle.The wires were very taut, and when the last thread was
reached one of them sprang away so violently that the turn-buckle was
knocked from his hand.The next moment they heard it rattling in the
gorge below.Havens sat flat down on the shelf of rocks and looked at the parted
wires hopelessly.“Well,” the millionaire said presently, “I guess we’re in for a good
long cold night up in the sky.”

“Did you ever see such rotten luck?” demanded Glenn.“Cheer up!” cried Ben.“We’ll find some way out of it.”

“Have you got any fish-lines, boys?” asked the aviator.“You bet I have!” replied Ben.“You wouldn’t catch me off on a
flying-machine trip without a fish-line.We’re going to have some fish
before we get off the Andes.”

“Well,” said Mr.Havens, “pass it over and I’ll see if I can fasten
these wires together with strong cord and tighten them up with a
twister.”

“Why not?” asked Ben.“I’ve seen things of that kind done often enough!” declared Glenn.“And, besides,” Glenn added, “we may be able to use the worn turn-buckle
on the _Louise_ and go after repairs, leaving the _Bertha_ here.”

“I don’t like to do that!” objected the millionaire aviator.“I believe
we can arrange to take both machines out with us.”

But it was not such an easy matter fastening the cords and arranging the
twister as had been anticipated.They all worked over the problem for an
hour or more without finding any method of preventing the fish-line from
breaking when the twister was applied.When drawn so tight that it was
impossible to slip, the eyes showed a disposition to cut the strands.At last they decided that it would be unsafe to use the _Bertha_ in that
condition and turned to the _Louise_ with the worn turn-buckle.To their dismay they found that the threads were worn so that it would
be unsafe to trust themselves in the air with any temporary expedient
which might be used to strengthen the connection.“This brings us back to the old proposition of a night under the
clouds!” the millionaire said.“Or above the clouds,” Ben added, “if this fog keeps coming.”

Leaving the millionaire still studying over the needed repairs, Ben and
his chum followed the circular cliff for some distance until they came
to the east side of the cone.They stood looking over the landscape for
a moment and then turned back to the machines silently and with grave
faces.“Have you got plenty of ammunition, Mr.“I think so,” was the reply.“That’s good!” answered Ben.“Why the question?” Mr.Havens asked, with a surprised look.“Because,” Ben replied, “there’s a lot of Peruvian miners down on a
lower shelf of this cone and they’re drunk.”

“Well, they can’t get up here, can they?” asked Mr.“They’re making a stab at it!” answered Ben.“There seems to be a strike or something of that sort on down there,”
Glenn explained, “and it looks as if the fellows wanted to get up here
and take possession of the aeroplanes.”

“Perhaps we can talk them out of it!” smiled the millionaire.“I’m afraid we’ll have to do something more than talk,” Glenn answered.The three now went to the east side of the cone and looked down.There
was a gully leading from the shelf to a plateau below.At some past time
this gully had evidently been the bed of a running mountain stream.On
the plateau below were excavations and various pieces of crude mining
machinery.Between the excavations and the bottom of the gully at least a hundred
men were racing for the cut, which seemed to offer an easy mode of
access to the shelf where the flying machines lay.“We’ll have to stand here and keep them back!” Mr.“I don’t believe we can keep them back,” Glenn answered, “for there may
be other places similar to this.Those miners can almost climb a
vertical wall.”

The voices of the miners could now be distinctly heard, and at least
three or four of them were speaking in English.His words were greeted by a howl of derision.Havens said in a moment, “one of you would better go back
to the machines and see if there is danger from another point.”

Ben started away, but paused and took his friend by the arm.“What do you think of that?” he demanded, pointing away to the south.Havens grasped the boy’s hand and in the excitement of the moment
shook it vigorously.“I think,” he answered, “that those are the lights of the _Ann_, and
that we’ll soon have all the turn-buckles we want.”

The prophesy was soon verified.The _Ann_ landed with very little
difficulty, and the boys were soon out on the ledge.The miners drew back grumbling and soon disappeared in the excavations
below.As may well be imagined the greetings which passed between the two
parties were frank and heartfelt.The repair box of the _Ann_ was well
supplied with turn-buckles, and in a very short time the three machines
were on their way to the south.Havens and Sam sat together on the _Ann_, and during the long hours
after midnight while the machines purred softly through the chill air of
the mountains, the millionaire was informed of all that had taken place
at the ruined temple.“And that ruined temple you have described,” Mr.Havens said, with a
smile, “is in reality one of the underground stations on the way to the
Mystery of the Andes at Lake Titicaca.”

“And why?” asked Sam, “do they call any special point down there the
mystery of the Andes?There are plenty of mysteries in these tough old
mountain ranges!” he added with a smile.“But this is a particularly mysterious kind of a mystery,” replied Mr.“I’ll tell you all about it some other time.”




                             CHAPTER XXII.A great camp-fire blazed in one of the numerous valleys which nestle in
the Andes to the east of Lake Titicaca.The three flying machines, the
_Ann_, the _Louise_ and the _Bertha_, lay just outside the circle of
illumination.It was the evening of the fourth day after the incidents
recorded in the last chapter.The Flying Machine Boys had traveled at good speed, yet with frequent
rests, from the mountain cone above the Peruvian mines to the little
valley in which the machines now lay.Jimmie and Carl, well wrapped in blankets, were lying with their feet
extended toward the blaze, while Glenn was broiling venison steak at one
corner of the great fire, and, also, as he frequently explained,
broiling his face to a lobster finish while he turned the steaks about
in order to get the exact finish.The millionaire aviator and Sam sat some distance away discussing
prospects and plans for the next day.While they talked an Indian
accompanied by Ben came slowly out of the shadows at the eastern edge of
the valley and approached the fire.“Have you discovered the Mystery of the Andes?” asked Havens with a
laugh as the two came up.“We certainly have discovered the Mystery of the Andes!” cried Ben
excitedly.“But we haven’t discovered the mystery of the mystery!”

“Come again!” shouted Jimmie springing to his feet.“You see,” Ben went on, “Toluca took me to a point on the cliff to the
south from which the ghost lights of the mysterious fortress can be
seen, but we don’t know any more about the origin of the lights than we
did before we saw them.”

“Then there really are lights?” asked Carl.“There certainly are!” replied Ben.“What kind of an old shop, is it?” asked Jimmie.“It’s one of the old-time fortresses,” replied Ben.“It is built on a
steep mountainside and guards a pass between this valley and one beyond.It looks as if it might have been a rather formidable fortress a few
hundred years ago, but now a shot from a modern gun would send the
battlements flying into the valley.”

“But why the lights?” demanded Jimmie.“That’s the mystery!” Ben answered.“They’re ghost lights!”

“Up to within a few months,” Mr.Havens began, “this fortress has never
attracted much attention.It is said to be rather a large fortification,
and some of the apartments are said to extend under the cliff, in the
same manner as many of the gun rooms on Gibraltar extend into the
interior of that solid old rock.”

“More subterranean passages!” groaned Jimmie.“I never want to see or
hear of one again.Ever since that experience at the alleged temple they
will always smell of wild animals and powder smoke.”

“A few months ago,” the millionaire aviator continued, smiling
tolerantly at the boy, “ghostly lights began making their appearance in
the vicinity of the fort.American scientists who were in this part of
the country at that time made a careful investigation of the
demonstrations, and reported that the illuminations existed only in the
imaginations of the natives.And yet, it is certain that the scientists
were mistaken.”

“More bunk!” exclaimed Carl.Havens went on, “the natives kept religiously away from
the old fort, but now they seem to be willing to gather in its vicinity
and worship at the strange fires which glow from the ruined battlements.It is strange combination, and that’s a fact.”

“How long have these lights been showing?” asked Sam.“Perhaps six months,” was the reply.“I apprehend,” he said, “that you know exactly what that means.”

“I think I do!” was the reply.“Put us wise to it!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Perhaps,” smiled the millionaire, “I would better satisfy myself as to
the truth of my theory before I say anything more about it.”

“All right,” replied the boy with the air of a much-abused person, “then
I’ll go back to my blanket and sleep for the rest of my three weeks!”

“If you do,” Glenn cut in, “you’ll miss one of these venison steaks.”

Jimmie was back on his feet in a minute.“Lead me to it!” he cried.The boys still declare that that was the most satisfying meal of which
they ever partook.The broiled steaks were excellent, and the tinned
goods which had been purchased at one of the small Peruvian mining towns
on the way down, were fresh and sweet.As may be understood without extended description, the work of washing
the dishes and cleaning up after the meal was not long extended!In an hour every member of the party except Toluca was sound asleep.The
Indian had been engaged on the recommendation of an acquaintance at one
of the towns on the line of the interior railroad, and was entirely
trustworthy.He now sat just outside the circle of light, gazing with
rapt attention in the direction of the fortress which for some time past
had been known as the Mystery of the Andes.A couple of hours passed, and then Ben rolled over to where Jimmie lay
asleep, his feet toasting at the fire, his head almost entirely covered
by his blanket.“Wake up, sleepy-head!” Ben whispered.Jimmie stirred uneasily in his slumber and half opened his eyes.“Go on away!” he whispered.“But look here!” Ben insisted.“I’ve got something to tell you!”

Toluca arose and walked over to where the two boys were sitting.“Look here!” Ben went on.“Here’s Toluca now, and I’ll leave it to him
if every word I say isn’t true.He can’t talk much United States, but he
can nod when I make a hit.Can’t you, Toluca?”

The Indian nodded and Ben went on:

“Between this valley,” the boy explained, “and the face of the mountain
against which the fort sticks like a porous plaster is another valley.Through this second valley runs a ripping, roaring, foaming, mountain
stream which almost washes the face of the cliff against which the
fortress stands.This stream, you understand, is one of the original
defences, as it cuts off approach from the north.”

“I understand,” said Jimmie sleepily.“Now, the only way to reach this alleged mystery of the Andes from this
direction seems to be to sail over this valley in one of the machines
and drop down on the cliff at the rear.”

“But is there a safe landing there?” asked the boy.“Toluca says there is!”

“Has he been there?” asked Jimmie.“Of course he has!” answered Ben.“He doesn’t believe in the Inca
superstitions about ghostly lights and all that.”

“Then why don’t we take one of the machines and go over there?” demanded
Jimmie.“That would be fun!”

“That’s just what I came to talk with you about?”

“I’m game for it!” the boy asserted.“As a matter of fact,” Ben explained as the boys arose and softly
approached the _Louise_, “the only other known way of reaching the
fortress is by a long climb which occupies about two days.Of course,”
he went on, “the old fellows selected the most desirable position for
defence when they built the fort.That is,” he added, “unless we reach
it by the air route.”

“The air line,” giggled Jimmie, “is the line we’re patronizing
to-night.”

“Of course!” Ben answered.“All previous explorers, it seems, have
approached the place on foot, and by the winding ledges and paths
leading to it.Now, naturally, the people who are engineering the ghost
lights and all that sort of thing there see the fellows coming and get
the apparatus out of sight before the visitors arrive.”

“Does Mr.Havens know all about this?” asked Jimmie.“You’re dense, my son!” whispered Ben.“We’ve come all this way to light
down on the fortress in the night-time without giving warning of our
approach.That’s why we came here in the flying machines.”

“He thinks Redfern is here?” asked Jimmie.“He thinks this is a good place to look for him!” was the reply.“Then we’ll beat him to it!” Jimmie chuckled.Toluca seemed to understand what the boys were about to do and smiled
grimly as the machine lifted from the ground and whirled softly away.As
the _Louise_ left the valley, Mr.Havens and Sam turned lazily in their
blankets, doubtless disturbed by the sound of the motors, but, all being
quiet about the camp, soon composed themselves to slumber again.“Now, we’ll have to go slowly!” Ben exclaimed as the machine lifted so
that the lights of the distant mystery came into view, “for the reason
that we mustn’t make too much noise.Besides,” he went on, “we’ve got to
switch off to the east, cut a wide circle around the crags, and come
down on the old fort from the south.”

“And when we get there?” asked Jimmie.“Why,” replied Ben, “we’re going to land and sneak into the fort!That’s
what we’re going for!”

“I hope we won’t tumble into a lot of jaguars, and savages, and
half-breed Spaniards!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Oh, we’re just going to look now,” Ben answered, “and when we find out
what’s going on there we’re coming back and let Mr.We wouldn’t like to take all the glory away from him.”

Following this plan, the boys sent the machine softly away to the east,
flying without lights, and at as low altitude as possible, until they
were some distance away from the camp.In an hour the fortress showed to the north, or at least the summit
under which it lay did.“There’s the landing-place just east of that cliff,” Ben exclaimed, as
he swung still lower down.“I’ll see if I can hit it.”

The _Louise_ took kindly to the landing, and in ten minutes more the
boys were moving cautiously in the direction of the old fort, now lying
dark and silent under the starlight.It seemed to Jimmie that his heart
was in his throat as the possible solution of the mystery of the Andes
drew near!TWO RUNAWAY AVIATORS!Half an hour after the departure of the _Louise_, Sam awoke with a start
and moved over to where the millionaire aviator was sleeping.“Time to be moving!” he whispered in his ear.Havens yawned, stretched himself, and threw his blanket aside.“I don’t know,” he said with a smile, “but we’re doing wrong in taking
all the credit of this game.The boys have done good work ever since
leaving New York, and my conscience rather pricks me at the thought of
leaving them out of the closing act.”

“Well,” Sam answered, “the boys are certainly made of the right
material, if they are just a little too much inclined to take
unnecessary risks.I wouldn’t mind having them along, but, really,
there’s no knowing what one of them might do.”

“Very well,” replied Mr.Havens, “we’ll get underway in the _Ann_ and
land on top of the fortress before the occupants of that musty old
fortification know that we are in the air.”

“That’s the talk!” Sam agreed.“We’ll make a wide circuit to the west
and come up on that side of the summit which rises above the fort.I’m
certain, from what I saw this afternoon, that there is a good
landing-place there.Most of these Peruvian mountain chains,” he went
on, “are plentifully supplied with good landings, as the shelves and
ledges which lie like terraces on the crags were formerly used as
highways and trails by the people who lived here hundreds of years ago.”

“We must be very careful in getting away from the camp,” Mr.“We don’t want the boys to suspect that we are going off on a
little adventure of our own.”

“Very well,” replied the other, “I’ll creep over in the shadows and push
the _Ann_ down the valley so softly that they’ll never know what’s taken
place.If you walk down a couple of hundred yards, I’ll pick you up.Then we’ll be away without disturbing any one.”

So eager were the two to leave the camp without their intentions being
discovered by the others, that they did not stop to see whether all the
three machines were still in place.The _Ann_ stood farthest to the
east, next to the _Bertha_, and Sam crept in between the two aeroplanes
and began working the _Ann_ slowly along the grassy sward.Had he lifted his head for a moment and looked to the rear, he must have
seen that only the _Bertha_ lay behind him.Had he investigated the two
rolls of blankets lying near the fire, he would have seen that they
covered no sleeping forms!The _Ann_ moved noiselessly
down the valley to where Mr.Havens awaited her and was sent into the
air.The rattle of the motors seemed to the two men to be loud enough to
bring any one within ten miles out of a sound sleep, but they saw no
movements below, and soon passed out of sight.Wheeling sharply off to the west, they circled cliffs, gorges and grassy
valleys for an hour until they came to the western <DW72> of the mountain
which held the fortress.It will be remembered that the _Louise_ had
circled to the east.Havens said as he slowed down, “if we find a
landing-place here, even moderately secure, down we go.If I don’t, I’ll
shoot up again and land squarely on top of the fort.”

“I don’t believe it’s got any roof to land on!” smiled Sam.“Yes, it has!” replied Mr.“I’ve had the old fraud investigated.I know quite a lot about her!”

“You have had her investigated?” asked Sam, in amazement.“You know very well,” the millionaire went on, “that we have long
suspected Redfern to be hiding in this part of Peru.I can’t tell you
now how we secured all the information we possess on the subject.“However, it is enough to say that by watching the mails and sending out
messengers we have connected the rival trust company of which you have
heard me speak with mysterious correspondents in Peru.The work has been
long, but rather satisfying.”

“Why,” Sam declared, “I thought this expedition was a good deal of a
guess!I hadn’t any idea you knew so much about this country.”

“We know more about it than is generally believed,” was the answer.“Deposit box A, which was robbed on the night Ralph Hubbard was
murdered, contained, as I have said, all the information we possessed
regarding this case.When the papers were stolen I felt like giving up
the quest, but the code telegrams cheered me up a bit, especially when
they were stolen.”

“I don’t see anything cheerful in having the despatches stolen.”

“It placed the information I possessed in the hands of my enemies, of
course,” the other went on, “but at the same time it set them to
watching the points we had in a way investigated, and which they now
understood that we intended to visit.”

“I don’t quite get you!” Sam said.“You had an illustration of that at the haunted temple,” Mr.“The Redfern group knew that that place was on my list.By
some quick movement, understood at this time only by themselves, they
sent a man there to corrupt the custodian of the captive animals.Only for courage and good sense, the machines
would have been destroyed.”

“The savages unwittingly helped some!” suggested Sam.“Yes, everything seemed to work to your advantage,” Mr.“At the mines, now,” he continued, “we helped ourselves out
of the trap set for us.”

“You don’t think the miners, too, were working under instructions?”
asked Sam.“That seems impossible!”

“This rival trust company,” Mr.Havens went on, “has agents in every
part of the world.It is my
belief that not only the men of the mine we came upon, but the men of
every other mine along the Andes, were under instructions to look out
for, and, under some pretense, destroy any flying machines which made
their appearance.”

“They are nervy fighters, anyway, if this is true!” Sam said.“They certainly are, and for the very good reason that the arrest and
conviction of Redfern would place stripes on half a dozen of the
directors of the new company.As you have heard me say before, the proof
is almost positive that the money embezzled from us was placed in this
new company.Redfern is a sneak, and will confess everything to protect
himself.Hence, the interest of the trust company in keeping him out of
sight.”

“Well, I hope he won’t get out of sight after to-night,” suggested Sam.“I hope we’ll have him good and tight before morning.”

“I firmly believe that he will be taken to-night!” was the reply.The machine was now only a short distance above the ledge upon which the
aviator aimed to land.Even in the dim light they could see a level
stretch of rock, and the _Ann_ was soon resting easily within a short
distance of the fort, now hidden only by an angle of the cliff.Presently the two moved forward together and looked around the base of
the cliff.The fort lay dark and silent in the night.So far as
appearances were concerned, there had never been any lights displayed
from her battlements during the long years which had passed away since
her construction!There was only a very narrow ledge between the northern wall of the fort
and the precipice which struck straight down into the valley, three
hundred feet below.In order to reach the interior of the fortification
from the position they occupied, it would be necessary for Havens and
his companion to pass along this ledge and creep into an opening which
faced the valley.At regular intervals on the outer edge of this ledge were balanced great
boulders, placed there in prehistoric times for use in case an attempt
should be made to scale the precipice.A single one of these rocks, if
cast down at the right moment, might have annihilated an army.The two men passed along the ledge gingerly, for they understood that a
slight push would send one of these boulders crashing down.At last they
came to what seemed to be an entrance into the heart of the fortress.There were no lights in sight as they looked in.The place seemed
utterly void of human life.Sam crept in first and waited for his companion to follow.Havens
sprang at the ledge of the opening, which was some feet above the level
of the shelf on which he stood, and lifted himself by his arms.As he
did so a fragment of rock under one hand gave way and he dropped back.In saving himself he threw out both feet and reached for a crevice in
the wall.This would have been an entirely safe procedure if his feet
had not come with full force against one of the boulders overlooking the
valley.He felt the stone move under the pressure, and the next instant, with a
noise like the discharge of a battery of artillery, the great boulder
crashed down the almost perpendicular face of the precipice and was
shattered into a thousand fragments on a rock which lay at the verge of
the stream below.With a soft cry of alarm, Sam bent over the ledge which protected the
opening and seized his employer by the collar.It was quick and
desperate work then, for it was certain that every person within a
circuit of many miles had heard the fall of the boulder.Doubtless in less than a minute the occupants of the fortress—if such
there were—would be on their feet ready to contest the entrance of the
midnight visitors.“We’ve got to get into some quiet nook mighty quick,” Sam whispered in
Mr.Havens’ ear as the latter was drawn through the opening.“I guess
the ringing of that old door-bell will bring the ghost out in a hurry!”

The two crouched in an angle of the wall at the front interior of the
place and listened.Directly a light flashed out at the rear of what
seemed to the watchers to be an apartment a hundred yards in length.Then footsteps came down the stone floor and a powerful arc light filled
every crevice and angle of the great apartment with its white rays.There was no need to attempt further concealment.The two sprang
forward, reaching for their automatics, as three men with weapons
pointing towards them advanced under the light.“I guess,” Sam whispered, “that this means a show-down.”

“There’s no getting out of that!” whispered Havens.“We have reached the
end of the journey, for the man in the middle is Redfern!”




                             CHAPTER XXIV.As Redfern and his two companions advanced down the apartment, their
revolvers leveled, Havens and Sam dropped their hands away from their
automatics.“Hardly quick enough, Havens,” Redfern said, advancing with a wicked
smile on his face.“To tell you the truth, old fellow, we have been
looking for you for a couple of days!”

“I’ve been looking for you longer than that!” replied Mr.“Well,” Redfern said with a leer, “it seems that we have both met our
heart’s desire.How are your friends?”

“Sound asleep and perfectly happy,” replied the millionaire.“You mean that they were asleep when you left them.”

“Certainly!”

“Fearful that they might oversleep themselves,” Redfern went on, “I sent
my friends to awake them.I expect
to hold quite a reception to-night.”

Laying his automatic down on the floor, Havens walked deliberately to a
great easy-chair which stood not far away and sat down.No one would
judge from the manner of the man that he was not resting himself in one
of his own cosy rooms at his New York hotel.Sam was not slow in
following the example of his employer.Redfern frowned slightly at the
nonchalance of the man.“You make yourself at home!” he said.“I have a notion,” replied Mr.Havens, “that I paid for most of this
furniture.I think I have a right to use it.”

“Look here, Havens,” Redfern said, “you have no possible show of getting
out of this place alive unless you come to terms with me.”

“From the lips of any other man in the world I might believe the
statement,” Mr.“But you, Redfern, have proven yourself
to be such a consummate liar that I don’t believe a word you say.”

“Then you’re not open to compromise?”

Havens shook his head.There was now a sound of voices in what seemed to be a corridor back of
the great apartment, and in a moment Glenn and Carl were pushed into the
room, their wrists bound tightly together, their eyes blinking under the
strong electric light.Both boys were almost sobbing with rage and
shame.“They jumped on us while we were asleep!” cried Carl.Redfern went to the back of the room and looked out into the passage.“Where are the others?” he asked of some one who was not in sight.“These boys were the only ones remaining in camp,” was the reply.“Redfern,” said Havens, as coolly as if he had been sitting at his own
desk in the office of the Invincible Trust Company, “will you tell me
how you managed to get these boys here so quickly?”

“Not the slightest objection in the world,” was the reply.“There is a
secret stairway up the cliff.You took a long way to get here in that
clumsy old machine.”

“Thank you!” said Mr.“Now, if you don’t mind,” Redfern said, “we’ll introduce you to your new
quarters.They are not as luxurious as those you occupy in New York, but
I imagine they will serve your purpose until you are ready to come to
terms.”

He pointed toward the two prisoners, and the men by his side advanced
with cords in their hands.Havens extended his wrists with a smile on
his face and Sam did likewise.“You’re good sports,” cried Redfern.“It’s a pity we can’t come to
terms!”

“Never mind that!” replied Havens.“Go on with your program.”

Redfern walked back to the corridor and the prisoners heard him
dismissing some one for the night.“You may go to bed now,” he said.The two
men with me will care for the prisoners.”

The party passed down a stone corridor to the door of a room which had
evidently been used as a fortress dungeon in times past.Redfern turned
a great key in the lock and motioned the prisoners inside.At that moment he stood facing the prisoners with the two others at his
sides, all looking inquiringly into the faces of those who were taking
their defeat so easily.As Redfern swung his hand toward the open door he felt something cold
pressing against his neck.He turned about to face an automatic revolver
held in the hands of Ben Whitcomb!His two accomplices moved forward a
pace in defense, but drew back when they saw the automatic in Jimmie’s
hand within a foot of their breasts.“And now,” said Mr.Havens, as coolly as if the situation was being put
on in a New York parlor, “you three men will please step inside.”

“I’m a game loser, too!” exclaimed Redfern.In a moment the door was closed and locked and the cords were cut from
the hands of the four prisoners.“Good!” said Jimmie.“I don’t know what you fellows would do without me.I’m always getting you out of scrapes!”

What was said after that need not be repeated here.Havens thoroughly appreciated the service which had been
rendered.“The game is played to the end, boys,” he said in a moment.“The only
thing that remains to be done is to get Redfern down the secret stairway
to the machines.The others we care nothing about.”

“I know where that secret stairway is,” Ben said.“While we were
sneaking around here in the darkness, a fellow came climbing up the
stairs, grunting as though he had reached the top of the Washington
monument.”

“Where were the others put to bed?” asked Sam.“We heard Redfern dismiss
them for the night.Did you see where they went?”

“Sure!” replied Jimmie.“They’re in a room opening from this corridor a
little farther down.”

Mr.Havens took the key from the lock of the door before him and handed
it to Jimmie.“See if you can lock them in with this,” he said.The boy returned in a moment with a grin on his face.“They are locked in!” he said.“Are there any others here?” asked Havens.“They all go away at night,” he declared, “after they turn out the ghost
lights.Redfern it seems keeps only those two with him for company.Their friends will unlock them in the morning.”

Mr.Havens opened the door and called out to Redfern, who immediately
appeared in the opening.“Search his pockets and tie his hands,” the millionaire said, turning to
Sam.“You know what this means, Redfern?” he added to the prisoner.“It means Sing Sing,” was the sullen reply, “but there are plenty of
others who will keep me company.”

“That’s the idea!” cried Havens.“That’s just why I came here!I want
the officials of the new trust company more than I want you.”

“You’ll get them if I have my way about it!” was the reply.An hour later the _Ann_ and the _Louise_ dropped down in the green
valley by the camp-fire.Redfern was sullen at first, but before the
start which was made soon after sunrise he related to Havens the
complete story of his embezzlement and his accomplices.He told of the
schemes which had been resorted to by the officials of the new trust
company to keep him out of the United States, and to keep Havens from
reaching him.The Flying Machine Boys parted with Havens at Quito, the millionaire
aviator going straight to Panama with his prisoner, while the boys
camped and hunted and fished in the Andes for two weeks before returning
to New York.It had been the intention of the lads to bring Doran and some of the
others at Quito to punishment, but it was finally decided that the
victory had been so complete that they could afford to forgive their
minor enemies.They had been only pawns in the hands of a great
corporation.“The one fake thing about this whole proposition,” Jimmie said as the
boys landed in New York, sunburned and happy, “is that alleged Mystery
of the Andes!It was too commonplace—just a dynamo in a subterranean
mountain stream, and electric lights!Say,” he added, with one of his
inimitable grins, “electricity makes pretty good ghost lights, though!”

“Redfern revealed his residence by trying to conceal it!” declared Ben.Still,” he went on, “the Mystery was some
mystery for a long time!It must have cost a lot to set the stage for
it.”

The next day Mr.Havens called to visit the boys at their hotel.“While you were loafing in the mountains,” he said, after greetings had
been exchanged, “the murderer of Hubbard confessed and was sentenced to
die in the electric chair.Redfern and half a dozen directors of the new
trust company have been given long sentences at Sing Sing.”

“There are associates that ought to go, too!” Jimmie cried.“We’re not going to prosecute them,” Mr.“But this is
not to the point.The Federal Government wants you boys to undertake a
little mission for the Secret Service men.You see,” he went on, “you
boys made quite a hit in that Peruvian job.”

“Will Sam go?” asked Ben.“Sam is Sam no longer,” replied Mr.“He is now
Warren P. King, son of the banker!What do you think of that?”

“Then what was he doing playing the tramp?” asked Carl.“Oh, he quarreled with his father, and it was the old story, but it is
all smooth sailing for him now.He may go with you, but his father
naturally wants him at home for a spell.”

“Where are we to go?” asked Ben.“I’ll tell you that later,” was the reply.“Will you go?”

The boys danced around the room and declared that they were ready to
start that moment.The story of their adventures on the trip will be
found in the next volume of this series, entitled:

“The Flying Machine Boys on Secret Service; or, the Capture in the Air!”

[Transcriber's Note:

Alternative spellings retained.Toward night he gathers his family around him, and reads to
them selected chapters from the Bible.From the same book he teaches
his children to read until twilight is ended, whereupon the Boer's day
is ended, and he seeks his bed.During the dry season the programme varies only as far as his place of
abode is concerned.With the arrival of that season the Boer closes his
house and becomes a wanderer in pursuit of water.The sheep and cattle
are driven to the rivers, and the family follows in big transport
wagons, not unlike the American prairie-schooner, propelled by eight
spans of oxen.The family moves from place to place as the necessity
for new pasturage arises.With the approach of the wet season the
nomads prepare for the return to the deserted homestead, and, as soon as
the first rain has fallen and the grass has changed the colour of the
landscape, the Boer and his vast herds are homeward bound.The Boer homestead is as unpretentious as its owner.Generally it is a
low, one-story stone structure, with a steep tile roof and a small annex
in the rear, which is used as a kitchen.The door is on a level with
the ground, and four windows afford all the light that is required in
the four square rooms in the interior.A dining room and three bedrooms
suffice for a family, however large.The floors are of hardened clay,
liberally coated with manure, which is designed to ward off the
pestiferous insects that swarm over the plains.The house is usually situated in a valley and close to a stream, and, in
rare instances, is sheltered by a few trees that have been brought from
the coast country.Native trees are such a rarity that the traveller
may go five hundred miles without seeing a single specimen.The Boer
vrouw feels no need of firewood, however, for her ancestors taught her
to cook her meals over a fire of the dry product of the cattle-decked
plains.Personal uncleanliness is one of the great failings that has been
attributed to the Boer, but when it is taken into consideration that
water is a priceless possession on the plains of South Africa, no
further explanation is needed.The canard that the Boers go to bed
without undressing is as absurd as the one of like origin that an entire
family sleeps in one bed.Yet these fictions constantly appear, and
frequently over the names of persons who have penetrated into South
Africa no farther than Cape Town.The Boer here depicted is the representative Boer--the one who shoulders
his rifle and fights for his country; the one who watches his cattle on
the plains and pays his taxes; the one who tries to improve his
condition, and takes advantage of every opportunity for advancement that
is offered.There is a worthless Boer, as there is a worthless
Englishman, a worthless German, and a worthless American, but he is so
far in the minority that he need not be analyzed.There is, however, a Boer who lives in the towns and cities, and he
compares favourably with other men of South African birth.He has had
the advantage of better schools, and can speak one or more languages
besides his own.He is not so nomadic in his tendencies as his rural
countryman, and he has absorbed more of the modernisms.He can conduct
a philosophic argument, and his wife and daughters can play the piano.If he is wealthy, his son is a student at a European university and his
daughter flirting on the beach at Durban or attending a ladies' seminary
at Bloemfontein or Grahamstown.He is as progressive as any white man cares to be under that generous
South African sun, and when it comes to driving a bargain he is a match
for any of the money sharks of Johannesburg.For the youthful Boer who
reaches the city directly from the country, without any trade or
profession, the prospects are gloomy.He is at a great disadvantage when
put into competition with almost any class of residents.The occupations
to which he can turn are few, and these have been still further
restricted in late years by the destruction of cattle by the rinderpest
and the substitution of railways for road transport.His lack of
education unfits him for most of the openings provided in such a city as
Johannesburg, even when business is at its highest tide, and a small
increase in the tension of business brings him to absolute want.The Boer of to-day is a creature of circumstance.He is outstripped
because he has had no opportunities for development.Driven from Cape
Colony, where he was rapidly developing a national character, he was
compelled to wander into lands that offered no opportunities of any
description.He has been cut off for almost a hundred years from an
older and more energetic civilization, and even from his neighbours; it
is no wonder that he is a century behind the van.No other civilized
race on earth has been handicapped in such a manner, and if there had
been one it is a matter for conjecture whether it would have held its
own, as the Boer has done, or whether it would have fallen to the level
of the savage.Had the Boer Voortrekkers been fortunate enough to settle in a fertile
country bordering on the sea, where they might have had communication
with the outer world, their descendants would undoubtedly to-day be
growing cane and wheat instead of herding cattle and driving transport
wagons.Their love of freedom could not have been greater under those
circumstances, but they might have averted the conditions which now
threaten to erase their nation from the face of the earth.CHAPTER V

                            PRESIDENT KRUGER


Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger, or Uncle Paul, the Lion of Rustenberg,
is a man of most remarkable characteristics.A man of absolutely no
education, as we understand the word, he has, during the long years of a
notable career, so applied his inherent abilities, his natural
astuteness, the cunning acquired by constant battling with the wiles of
native enemies, as to be able to acquit himself of his high office in a
manner to be envied by many who have enjoyed a hundred times as many
advantages.Although he is almost seventy-five years old, the
President's mind has not become dimmed, but, if anything, has grown
keener of perception and wider in its scope during the last ten years.Kruger has been a leader among his countrymen.When
a boy he had pronounced ability as a deer-stalker, and it is related of
him that before he had reached manhood he had killed more lions than any
other man in the colony.He was absolutely fearless, and could endure
any amount of bodily pain and discomfort.As an example of this, I
repeat his explanation of the accident that caused him to lose his left
thumb:

"We were shooting rhinoceros one day," said he, "when an old gun
exploded in my hands.It cut my thumb so badly that I saw it could not
be saved.I borrowed a dull knife and cut the thumb off, because it
prevented me from holding the gun properly."He impresses one as
being a king in the garb of a farmer, a genius in a dunce's cap.At
first sight he would be mistaken for an awkward countryman, with "store
clothes" and a silk hat intended for some one else.His frock coat is
far too small to reach around his corpulent body, and his trousers seem
to have a natural antipathy for his shoes.He wears no cuffs, and the presence of a collar and tie may be
determined only by drawing aside the natural curtain formed by his
whiskers.He is uncouth in his manner, but he has great natural
attractiveness gained by a long life among hunters in the wilds.He is
suspicious of everything and every one, but that quality is easily
accounted for by his early dealings with <DW64> chiefs, whose treacherous
habits caused him to become wary in all his transactions with them.In
later days this has stood him in good stead.He is slow to make
friends, but once he trusts a person voluminous proof is necessary
before he alters his opinion of the man.He never forgets a good deed,
and never pardons the man who does a bad one.President Kruger is short in stature, measuring less than five feet
seven inches.His head and body are large and fat, but his legs are
thin and short.His head is just a trifle longer than broad, and almost
fits the English definition of "square head."The small eyes are
surmounted by bushy, white eyebrows, which extend half an inch beyond
his forehead.When he is not sitting for a photograph his hair is not so neatly
arranged as it appears in the well-known pictures, but hangs loosely
down over his wide forehead, except when, with a hasty swish of the
hand, he brushes it aside.The hair is nearly white, and hangs over the
sides of his head in long tresses, which cover both his ears.When he smiles the big fat circles above his cheeks are pushed upward,
and shut his small gray eyes from view.But when pleased the President
generally laughs hilariously, and then his eyes remain closed for the
greater part of a minute.Kruger's nose and mouth are the chief
features of his face.Both are more extensive than his large face
demands, but they are such marvels in their own peculiar way as to be
distinguishing marks.The bridge of the nose grows wide as it goes
outward from the point between the eyes, and before it reaches the tip
it has a gentle upheaval.Then it spreads out on either side, and
covers fully two inches of area above his upper lip.It is not
attractive, but in that it follows the general condition of his facial
landscape.The constant use of a heavy pipe has
caused a deep depression on the left side of his lower lip, and this
gives the whole mouth the appearance of being unbalanced.His chin is
large and prominent, and his ears correspond relatively in size and
symmetry with his face.When in repose his features are not pleasant to
look upon, but when lighted up by a smile they become rather attractive,
and generally cause his laughter to become contagious among his hearers.The thin line of beard which runs from ear to ear combines with the hair
on his head in forming what is not unlike a white halo around the
President's face.The lines in the man's face are deep, irregular, and
very numerous.They indicate more than anything the ceaseless worry and
troubles to which the President has been subjected while directing the
affairs of his countrymen of the Transvaal.The physical description of the Kruger of to-day is one that suggests
sluggishness and idleness rather than alertness and ceaseless activity.The appearance of the man certainly does not conform with his record of
marvellous performances, unflagging endeavour, and superior mental
attainments.The well-preserved Kruger at seventy-five years bears no
deep marks of the busy and eventful life he has led, nor are there any
visible indications that the end of his usefulness to his people is
close at hand.Kruger's life, as related by himself,
gives an insight into his remarkably varied experiences.He modestly
refrains from allowing any one, even those who know him best, to obtain
from him enough of his own history to incorporate in a biography, and it
is likely, unless in his later years he changes his mind, that no
detailed narrative can ever be written.Although the majority of his countrymen are of Dutch or Huguenot
ancestry, Mr.Jacob Kruger, his paternal
ancestor, emigrated to South Africa, in 1713, from the Potsdam district
of Germany, and married a young woman who was born in Cape Colony.He
was born October 10, 1825, in Colesburg, Cape Colony, whither his
parents had "trekked" from Cape Town a quarter of a century before.The
first Krugers whose names appear in the Dutch East India Company's
records arrived in the settlement at the Cape in 1712, and thereafter
became leaders in enterprise among the settlers.Kruger was
yet in his infancy the Boers' troubles with the Colonial Government
began, and when he was ten years old he migrated with the "Voortrekkers"
to the unknown regions in the interior.The life in the open and the tropical temperature served to develop him
early, and at the age of fifteen we find him shooting his first lion, as
well as serving in the capacity of "field cornet," a minor official
position.As such he took part in the wars with the Zulu Dingaan and
the Matabele Moselekatse, and served with distinction.In 1842 he was
confirmed by the Rev.Daniel Lindley, the American missionary, and had
implanted more firmly in his heart the religious feeling which in later
years has proved to be his greatest solace in his troubles.Next we hear of him standing by the side of his father while he fires
the first shot at the English soldiers in the battle of Boomplaats, in
1848.After doing valiant service in that battle, he became one of the
leaders of the "trekkers" who settled in the Transvaal country.In 1856 young Kruger, then barely thirty-one years old, is elected
sub-commandant of the Transvaal army, a most responsible position in a
country where natives are as treacherous as they are innumerable.Five
years later he becomes commandant of the army, and leads a force of one
hundred and fifty men against Chief Sechele.He retains that office
until 1877, when England annexes the country to her domain.During the
war for independence which then ensues, Mr.Kruger is Vice-President of
the Triumvirate, which executes the government of the country, and after
peace is declared in 1883 he is elected to the presidency.He is thrice
re-elected, and is now serving his fourth term as head of the South
African Republic.Into this skeleton of his life's story might be fitted innumerable
incidents and anecdotes that are related by his countrymen, who treasure
them greatly and repeat them at every opportunity.Many of these are
probably imaginary, while others have undoubtedly been retold so
frequently that they have lost all resemblance of the original form.Kruger's prowess in dealing
with lions, tigers, and elephants, and many of these are probably true.Several of those that he himself verifies are given merely to illustrate
the experiences that the Boers encountered in the early days of the
"trekkers."When fifteen years old Kruger and one of his sisters, being left alone
on the veldt by their parents, were approached by a South African
panther, small but of ample enough proportions to frighten the two
children.Kruger, with only a knife for a weapon, boldly attacked the
panther, and after a severe struggle, during which he was sorely
injured, slew the beast.Another story, illustrative of his physical
strength, is that he contested with a native in a foot-race of twelve
hours' duration, and won by such a large margin that he was enabled to
stalk a buck on the veldt and carry it to his father's house before his
competitor reached the goal.During the "trekking" trip from Cape Colony to the final settlement in
the Transvaal the Boer settlers shot no less than six thousand lions,
and of that number Kruger is credited with shooting more than two
hundred and fifty.His personal bravery was never shown to better advantage than in 1857,
when he was sub-commandant of the Transvaal army.He had ordered
several of his burghers to go into the Orange Free State, with which
country there was a serious misunderstanding, and there they were
arrested.Kruger heard of the men's arrest he hastened
into the camp of the Free State forces and asked for the release of the
prisoners on the ground that they were innocent, and that if any one
were guilty he was that man, because he had ordered them to enter the
country.The commandant of the Free State forces was so greatly amazed
by Mr.Kruger's bravery that he allowed all the Boers to return to their
own camp.Kruger's remarkable vitality and capacity for hard mental labour are
the results of the great care which he bestows upon himself and the
regular habits which he has followed for almost twenty years.He rises
at half past five o'clock every morning, and follows a daily programme,
from which he never deviates unless he is absent from home.After he
leaves his bedroom he proceeds to his library and drinks several cups of
intensely black coffee, and smokes several pipefuls of strong Boer
tobacco.Then he spends the greater part of an hour in family devotions
and the perusal of the Bible.After breakfast, at half past seven
o'clock, he receives the members of the Volksraad, and then transacts
the heaviest business of the day.After all the Volksraad members have
departed, he steps out on the piazza of his little whitewashed cottage
and joins the burghers, or citizens, who every morning congregate there
and discuss state affairs while they sip the coffee and smoke the
tobacco which the President furnishes to all visitors.At ten o'clock the state carriage and its escort of eight gaudily
apparelled troopers await him at the gate, and he is conveyed to the
Government House, several blocks distant.As soon as he arrives there
he is to be found either in one legislative chamber or the other,
directing the affairs of the two bodies, making addresses or quietly
watching the progress of legislative matters.At noon he returns to his
home for luncheon, but is back at his duties in the Government House at
two o'clock, and remains there three hours in the afternoon.Thereafter
he receives burghers at his home until seven o'clock, and retires every
evening at precisely eight o'clock.Kruger has over the majority of his countrymen is
due in no small measure to his fondness for conversing with them and his
treatment of them when they visit his cottage.As soon as the sun has
risen, a small stream of Boers wends its way toward the President's
cottage and awaits his appearance on the piazza.Kruger comes
among them he loses his identity as President, and merges his
personality into that of an ordinary burgher.This custom has endeared
him in the affections of his people, and, as a result, whenever he makes
a stand on any question it may be taken for granted that he has
thoroughly discussed the subject beforehand with his burghers, and that
he can depend upon the majority of them for their support.Kruger is a speech-maker of no mean ability.His addresses in the
Volksraad are filled with good reasoning, homely similes, biblical
quotations, and convincing argument.He speaks without preparation,
indulges in no flights of oratory, but uses the simple, plain language
that is easily understood by the burgher as well as the statesman.All
his speeches are delivered in the Boer "taal," a dialect which bears the
same relation to the Dutch language as "low" German does to "high"
German.Generally the dialect is used by the Boers in speaking only,
the pure Dutch being used in correspondence and official state papers.The President may be able to speak the English language, but if such is
the case he succeeds admirably in allowing no one except his most
trusted friends to hear him.Much investigation has failed to reveal
any one in Pretoria who has ever heard him speak the English language,
although reports have it that he speaks it fluently.He understands the
language well, and any one who has ever held a conversation with him
through an interpreter will recall that he occasionally forgets his
assumed inability to understand English, and replies to a question
before the interpreter has commenced to translate it.His first wife, a Miss Du Plessis,
was the daughter of one of the early voortrekkers, and with the other
women took part in many of the Boer wars against the natives.She died
shortly after the founding of the republic, and left one son, who lived
only a short time.Kruger several years afterward married his first
wife's niece, who is now the first lady of the land.Like almost all
Boer women, she has a retiring disposition, and very rarely appears in
public except at religious gatherings.The President rarely introduces
her to his visitors, probably in obedience to her own desires, but she
constantly entertains the wives and daughters of burghers who call on
her husband.President and Madame Kruger have had sixteen children, seven of whom
still live.One of his sons is the President's private secretary, and a
youth of decidedly modern ideas and tendencies.Another son is a
private in the Pretoria police, a state military organization in which
he takes great pride.A third occupies his father's farm near
Rustenberg.The other children are daughters, who are married to Boer
farmers and business men.One of Kruger's sons-in-law is Captain F. C.
Eloff, who was taken prisoner by the Uitlanders during the raid, and who
has since aroused the enmity of the English residents by freely
expressing his opinion of them in public speeches.Captain Eloff is
several times a millionaire, and lives in a
two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar mansion.Popular report in Pretoria has it that the President's wealth amounts to
a million dollars, but his mode of living certainly does not betray it.His salary as President is thirty-five thousand dollars, in addition to
which he is annually allowed fifteen hundred dollars for house-rent, or
"huishuur."He has long since purchased the house in which he lives,
but, as the allowance of fifteen hundred dollars is annually paid to
him, the English residents aver that the amount is intended as a slight
reimbursement to him for the money he spends for the coffee and tobacco
used by the burgher callers at his cottage.During the later years of
his life Barney Barnato, the wizard of South African finance, supplied
to the President all the tobacco he used, and consequently Mr.Kruger
was able to save the Government tobacco allowance.Kruger two handsome marble statues of lions which now
adorn the lawn of the presidential residence.A photograph which is
greatly admired by the patriotic Boers represents Mr.Kruger
appropriately resting his hand on the head of one of the recumbent lions
in a manner which to them suggests the physical superiority of the Boers
over the British.Kruger has always been a man of deep and earnest religious
convictions.In his youth he was taught the virtues of a Christian
life, and it is not recorded that he ever did anything which was
inconsistent with his training.An old Zulu headman who lives near the
Vaal River, in the Orange Free State, relates that Mr.Kruger yoked him
beside an ox in a transport wagon when the trekkers departed from Natal
in the early '40s, and compelled him to do the work of a beast; but he
has no good reason for declaring that his bondsman was Mr.Kruger rather
than any one of the other Boers in the party.Kruger was about thirty-five years old his religious enthusiasm
led him into an experience which almost resulted in his death.He had
met with some reverses, which caused him to doubt the genuineness of
religious assistance.He endeavoured to find comfort and consolation in
his Bible, but failed, and he became sorely troubled.One night, after
bidding farewell to his wife, he disappeared into the wilderness of the
Magalies Hills, a short distance west of Pretoria.After he had been
absent from his home for several days, a number of men went to the hills
to search for him, and found him on his knees engaged in singing and
praying.He had been so many days without food and water that he was
too weak to rise from the ground, and it was necessary for the men to
carry him to his home.Since that experience he has believed himself to
be a special instrument of a divine power, and by his deeds has given
the impression that he is a leader chosen to defend the liberties and
homes of his people.He never speaks of his experience in the hills, but those who have been
his friends for many years say that it marked an epoch in his life.The
Boers, who have none of the modern cynicism and scepticism, regard him
as the wielder of divine power, while those who admire nothing which he
is capable of doing scoff and jeer at him as a religious fanatic, and
even call him a hypocrite.Kruger in his
daily habits, or has heard him in the pulpit of the church opposite the
cottage where he lives, will bear witness to the intensity and
earnestness of his genuine religious feeling.The lessons of life which
he draws from his own personal experiences, and expounds to his
congregation with no little degree of earnestness, are of such a
character as to remove all doubts which the mind may have concerning his
purity of purpose.Kruger's style of writing is unique, but thoroughly characteristic
of himself.The many references to the Deity, the oftentimes pompous
style, the words which breathe of the intense interest in and loyalty to
his countrymen, all combine to make his state communications and
proclamations most interesting reading.The following proclamation, made
to the citizens of Johannesburg several days after the Jameson raid, is
typical:


                "_To all the Residents of Johannesburg_."I, S. J. P. Kruger, State President of the South African Republic, with
the advice and consent of the Executive Council, by virtue of Article VI
of the Minutes of the Council, dated January 10, 1896, do hereby make
known to all the residents of Johannesburg and neighbourhood that I am
inexpressibly thankful to God that the despicable and treacherous
incursion into my country has been prevented, and the independence of
the republic saved, through the courage and bravery of my burghers."The persons who have been guilty of this crime must naturally be
punished according to law--that is to say, they must stand their trial
before the high court and a jury--but there are thousands who have been
misled and deceived, and it has clearly appeared to me that even among
the so-called leaders of the movement there are many who have been
deceived."A small number of intriguers in and outside of the country ingeniously
incited a number of the residents of Johannesburg and surroundings to
struggle, under the guise of standing up for political rights, and day
by day, as it were, urged them on; and when in their stupidity they
thought that the moment had arrived, they (the intriguers) caused one
Dr.Jameson to cross the boundary of the republic."Did they ever ask themselves to what they were exposing you?"I shudder when I think what bloodshed could have resulted had a
merciful Providence not saved you and my burghers."I will not refer to the financial damage.Work together with the
Government of this republic, and strengthen their hands to make this
country a land wherein people of all nationalities may reside in common
brotherhood."For months and months I have planned what changes and reforms could
have been considered desirable in the Government and the state, but the
loathsome agitation, especially of the press, has restrained me."The same men who have publicly come forward as leaders have demanded
reforms from me, and in a tone and a manner which they would not have
ventured to have done in their own country, owing to fear for the
criminal law.For that cause it was made impossible for me and my
burghers, the founders of this republic, to take their preposterous
proposals in consideration."It is my intention to submit a draft law at the first ordinary session
of the Raad, whereby a municipality, with a mayor at the head, would be
granted to Johannesburg, to whom the control of the city will be
intrusted.According to all constitutional principles, the Municipal
Board will be elected by the people of the town."I earnestly request you, laying your hands on your hearts, to answer me
this question: After what has happened, can and may I submit this to the
representatives of the people?My reply is, I know there are thousands
in Johannesburg and the suburbs to whom I can intrust such elective
powers.Inhabitants of Johannesburg, render it possible for the
Government to go before the Volksraad with the motto, 'Forgotten and
Forgiven.'"Kruger's political platform is based on one of the paragraphs of a
manifesto which he, as Vice-President of the Triumvirate, sent to Sir
Owen Lanyon, the British Resident Commissioner, on Dingaan's Day, 1880,
when the Boers were engaged in their second struggle for independence.The paragraph, which was apparently written by Mr.Kruger, reads:


"We declare before God, who knows the heart, and before the world: Any
one speaking of us as rebels is a slanderer!The people of the South
African Republic have never been subjects of Her Majesty, and never will
be."The President's hatred of the English was bred in the bone, and it will
never be eradicated.To see his country free from every English tie is
the aim of his existence, and every act of his political career has been
born with that thought.His own political aggrandizement has always
been a secondary thought.He himself has declared that there is no one
in the republic who is able or willing to complete the independence of
the republic with such little friction as he, and that, such being the
case, he would be a traitor to desert the cause in the hours of its
gravest peril.He considers personal victories at the polls of his own
country as mere stepping-stones toward that greater victory which he
hopes to secure over the English colonial secretary, and the day that
England renounces all claim to suzerainty over the Transvaal Mr.Kruger
will consider his duty done, and will go into the retirement which his
great work and the fulness of his years owe him.For a man whose education has been of the scantiest, and whose people
were practically unheard of until he brought them into prominence, Paul
Kruger has received from foreign sources many remarkable tributes to the
wisdom with which he has conducted the affairs of the country under
circumstances of more than ordinary difficulty.That which he received from Emperor William, of Germany, several days
after the repulse of the Jameson raiders, was perhaps the finest tribute
that Mr.Kruger has ever received, and one that created a greater
sensation throughout the world than any peaceful message that ever
passed between the heads of two governments.The cablegram, of which
the text follows, is one of the most priceless treasures in Mr.Kruger's
collection:


"_Received January 3d, 1896_."_From Wilhelm I. R., Berlin_."_To_ PRESIDENT KRUGER, _Pretoria_."I tender you my sincere congratulations that, without appealing to the
help of friendly powers, you and your people have been successful in
opposing with your own forces the armed bands that have broken into your
country to disturb the peace, in restoring order, and in maintaining the
independence of your country against attacks from without.Prince Bismarck declared that Kruger was the greatest natural-born
statesman of the time.William E. Gladstone, who had many opportunities
to gauge Kruger's skill in diplomacy, referred to him as the shrewdest
politician on the continent of Africa, and not a mean competitor of
those of Europe.Among the titles which have been bestowed upon him by
European rulers are Knight of the First Class of the Red Eagle of
Prussia, Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, Grand Knight of the
Leopold Order of Belgium, Grand Knight of the Netherland Lion, and Grand
Knight of the Portuguese Order of Distinguished Foreigners.Kruger's life could be obtained from his
own lips, it would compare favourably with those of the notable
characters of modern times.The victories he has gained in the field of
diplomacy may not have affected as many people as those of Bismarck; the
defeats administered in battle may not have been as crushing as those of
Napoleon, but to his weakling country they were equally as decisive and
valuable.The great pyramid in the valley of the Nile is seen to best advantage as
far away as Cairo.Observed close at hand, it serves only to disturb the
spectator's mind with an indefinable sense of vastness, crudity, and
weight; from a distance the relative proportions of all things are
clearly discerned.Historic
perspective is necessary to determine the value of the man to the
country.Fifty or a hundred years hence, when the Transvaal has safely
emerged from its period of danger, there will be a true sense of
proportion, so that his labours in behalf of his country may be judged
aright.At this time the critical faculty is lacking because his life work is
not ended, and its entire success is not assured.He has earned for
himself, however, the distinction of being the greatest diplomatist that
South Africa has ever produced.Whether the fruits of his diplomacy
will avail to keep his country intact is a question that will find its
answer in the results of future years.He has succeeded in doing that
which no man has ever done.As the head of the earth's weakest nation
he has for more than a decade defied its strongest power to take his
country from him.CHAPTER VI

                    INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT KRUGER


As is the rule with them everywhere, Englishmen in South Africa speak of
Mr.Unprejudiced Americans and other
foreigners in South Africa admire him for his patriotism, his courage in
opposing the dictatorial policy of England's Colonial Office, and his
efforts to establish a republic as nearly like that of the United States
of America as possible.Kruger was almost
obliterated a week after my arrival in the country by the words of
condemnation which were heaped upon him by Englishmen whenever his name
was mentioned.In nearly every Englishman's mind the name of "Oom Paul"
was a synonym for all that was corrupt and vile; few gave him a word of
commendation.When I came into the pretty little town of Pretoria, the capital of the
Transvaal, where the President lives and where he mingles daily with the
populace with as much freedom and informality as a country squire, there
was a rapid transformation in my opinion of the man.The Boers worship
their leader; to them he is a second George Washington, and even a few
Englishmen there speak with admiration of him.The day before my arrival in the town John McCann, of Johannesburg, who
is a former New-Yorker and a friend of the President, informed Mr.Kruger of my intention to visit Pretoria.The President had refused
interviews to three representatives of influential London newspapers who
had been in the town three months waiting for the opportunity, but he
expressed a desire to see an American."The Americans won't lie about me," he said to Mr."I want
America to learn our side of the story from me.They have had only the
English point of view."I had scarcely reached my hotel when an
emissary from the President called and made an appointment for me to
meet him in the afternoon.The emissary conducted me to the Government
Building, where the Volksraad was in session, and it required only a
short time for it to become known that a representative from the great
sister republic across the Atlantic desired to learn the truth about the
Boers.Cabinet members, Raad members, the
Commissioner of War, the Postmaster General, the most honoured and
influential men of the republic--men who had more than once risked their
lives in fighting for their country's preservation--gathered around me
and were so eager to have me tell America of the wrongs they had
suffered at the hands of the British that the scene was highly pathetic.One after another spoke of the severe trials through which their young
republic had passed, the efforts that had been made to disrupt it, and
the constant harassment to which they had been subjected by enemies
working under the cloak of friendship.The majority spoke English, but
such as knew only the Boer taal were given an opportunity by their more
fortunate friends to add to the testimony, and spoke through an
interpreter.Such earnest, such honest conversation it had never been
my lot to hear before.It was a memorable hour that I spent listening
to the plaints of those plain, good-hearted Boers in the heart of South
Africa.It was the voice of the downtrodden, the weak crying out
against the strong.When the hour of my appointment with the President arrived there was a
unanimous desire among the Boers gathered around to accompany me.It
was finally decided by them that six would be a sufficient number, and
among those chosen were Postmaster-General Van Alpen, who was a
representative at the Postal Congress in Washington several years ago;
Commissioner of Mines P. Kroebler, Commissioner of War J. J. Smidt,
Justice of the Peace Dillingham, and former Commandant-General Stephanne
Schoeman.When our party reached the little white-washed cottage in which the
President lives a score or more of tall and soil-stained farmers were
standing in a circular group on the low piazza.They were laughing
hilariously at something that had been said by a shorter, fat man who
was nearly hidden from view by the surrounding circle of patriarchs.A
breach in the circle disclosed the President of the republic with his
left arm on the shoulder of a long-whiskered Boer, and his right hand
swinging lightly in the hand of another of his countrymen.It was
democracy in its highest exemplification.Catching a glimpse of us as we were entering on the lawn, the President
hastily withdrew into the cottage.The Boers he deserted seated
themselves on benches and chairs on the piazza, relighted their pipes,
and puffed contentedly, without paying more attention to us than to nod
to several of my companions as we passed them.The front door of the cottage, or "White House," as they call it, was
wide open.There was no flunkey in livery to take our cards, no
white-aproned servant girls to tra-la-la our names.The executive
mansion of the President was as free and open to visitors as the
farmhouse of the humblest burgher of the republic.In their efforts to
display their qualities of politeness my companions urged me into the
President's private reception room, while they lingered for a short time
at the threshold.The President rose from his chair in the opposite
end, met me in the centre of the room, and had grasped my hand before my
companions had an opportunity of going through the process of an
introduction.There was less formality and red tape in meeting "Oom Paul" than would
be required to have a word with Queen Victoria's butcher or President
McKinley's office-boy.Kruger's small fat hand was holding mine in its grasp and
shaking it vehemently, he spoke something in Boer, to which I replied,
"Heel goed, danke," meaning "Very well, I thank you."Some one had told
me that he would first ask concerning my health, and also gave me the
formula for an answer.The President laughed heartily at my reply, and
made a remark in Boer "taal."The interpreter came up in the meantime
and straightened out the tangle by telling me that the President's first
question had been "Have you any English blood in your veins?"The President, still laughing at my reply, seated himself in a big
armchair at the head of a table on which was a heavy pipe and a large
tobacco box.He filled the pipe, lighted the tobacco, and blew great
clouds of smoke toward the ceiling.My companions took turns in filling
their pipes from the President's tobacco box, and in a few minutes the
smoke was so dense as nearly to obscure my view of the persons in front
of me.The President crossed his short, thin legs and blew quick, spirited
puffs of smoke while an interpreter translated to him my expression of
the admiration which the American people had for him, and how well known
the title "Oom Paul" was in America.This delighted the old man
immeasurably.His big, fat body seemed to resolve itself into waves
which started in his shoes and gradually worked upward until the fat
rings under his eyes hid the little black orbits from view.Then he
slapped his knees with his hands, opened his large mouth, and roared
with laughter.It was almost a minute before he regained his composure sufficiently to
take another puff at the pipe which is his constant companion.During
the old man's fit of laughter one of my companions nudged me and advised
me: "Now ask him anything you wish.He is in better humour than I have
ever seen him before."The President checked a second outburst of
laughter rather suddenly and asked, "Are you a friend of Cecil Rhodes?"If there is any one whom "Oom Paul" detests it is the great colonizer.The President invariably asks this question of strangers, and if the
answer is an affirmative one he refuses to continue the conversation.Being assured that such was not the case, Mr.Kruger's mind appeared to
be greatly relieved--as he is very suspicious of all strangers--and he
asked another question which is indicative of the religious side of his
nature: "To what Church do you belong?"A speaking acquaintanceship was
claimed with the Dutch Reformed Church, of which the President is a most
devout member, and this served to dissipate all suspicions he might have
had concerning me.The interpreter was repeating a question to him when the President
suddenly interrupted, as is frequently his custom during a conversation,
and asked: "Do the American people know the history of our people?I
will tell you truthfully and briefly.You have heard the English
version always; now I will give you ours."The President proceeded slowly and, between puffs at his great pipe,
spoke determinedly: "When I was a child we were so maltreated by the
English in Cape Colony that we could no longer bear the abuses to which
we were subjected.In 1835 we migrated northward with our cattle and
possessions and settled in Natal, just south of Zululand, where by
unavoidable fighting we acquired territory from the Zulus.We had
hardly settled that country and established ourselves and a local form
of government when our old enemies followed, and by various high-handed
methods made life so unendurable that we were again compelled to move
our families and possessions.This time we travelled five hundred miles
inland over the trackless veldt and across the Vaal River, and after
many hardships and trials settled in the Transvaal.The country was so
poor, so uninviting, that the English colonists did not think it worth
their while to settle in the land which we had chosen for our
abiding-place."Our people increased in number, and, as the years passed, established a
form of government such as yours in America.The British thought they
were better able to govern us than we were ourselves, and once took our
country from us.Their defeats at Laing's Nek and Majuba Hill taught
them that we were fighters, and they gave us our independence and
allowed us to live peaceably for a number of years.They did not think
the country valuable enough to warrant the repetition of the fighting
for it.When it became known all over the world twelve years ago that
the most extensive gold fields on the globe had been discovered in our
apparently worthless country, England became envious and laid plans to
annex such a valuable prize.Thousands of people were attracted hither
by our wonderful gold mines at Johannesburg, and the English statesmen
renewed their attacks on us.They made all sorts of pretexts to rob us
of our country, and when they could not do it in a way that was honest
and would be commended by other nations, they planned the Jameson raid,
which was merely a bold attempt to steal our country."At this point Kruger paused for a moment and then added, "You Americans
know how well they succeeded."This sally amused him and my companions
hugely, and they all joined in hearty laughter.The President declared that England's attitude toward them had changed
completely since the discovery of the gold fields."Up to that time we
had been living in harmony with every one.We always tried to be
peaceable and to prevent strife between our neighbours, but we have been
continually harassed since the natural wealth of our land has been
uncovered."Here he relighted his pipe, which had grown cold while he was detailing
the history of the Transvaal Boers, and then drew a parable, which is
one of his distinguishing traits: "The gold fields may be compared to a
pretty girl who is young and wealthy.You all admire her and want her
to be yours, but when she rejects you your anger rises and you want to
destroy her."By implication England is the rejected suitor, and the
Transvaal the rich young girl.Comparing the Boers' conduct in South Africa with that of the English,
the President said: "Ever since we left Cape Colony in 1835 we have not
taken any territory from the natives by conquest except that of one
chief whose murderous maraudings compelled us to drive him away from his
country.We bartered and bought every inch of land we now have, England
has taken all the land she has in South Africa at the muzzles of
repeating rifles and machine guns.That is the civilized method of
extending the bounds of the empire they talk about so much."The Englishmen's plaint is that the republic will tax them, but allow
them no representation in the affairs of government.The President
explained his side in this manner: "Every man, be he Englishman,
Chinaman, or Eskimo, can become a naturalized citizen of our country and
have all the privileges of a burgher in nine years.If we should have a
war, a foreigner can become a citizen in a minute if he will fight with
our army.The difficulty with the Englishmen here is that they want to
be burghers and at the same time retain their English citizenship."A man can not serve two masters; either he will hate the one and love
the other, or hold to the one and despise the other.We have a law for
bigamy in our country, and it is necessary to dispose of an old love
before it is possible to marry a new.""Oom Paul" is very bitter in his feeling against the English, whom he
calls his natural enemies, but it is seldom that he says anything
against them except in private to his most intimate friends.The
present great distress in the Johannesburg gold fields is attributed by
the English residents to the high protective duties imposed by the
Government and the high freight charges for the transmission of
machinery and coal.Kruger explained that those taxes were less
than in the other colonies in the country."We are high protectionists because ours is a young country.These new
mines have cost the Government great amounts of money, and it is
necessary for us to raise as much as we expend.They want us to give
them everything gratuitously, so that we may become bankrupt and they
can take our country for the debt.If they don't like our laws, why
don't they stay away?"Nowhere in the world is the American Republic admired as much outside of
its own territory as in South Africa.Both the Transvaal and the Orange
Free State Constitutions are patterned after that of the United States,
and there is a desire lurking in the breasts of thousands of South
Africans to convert the whole of the country south of the Zambezi into
one grand United States of South Africa.Sir Alfred Milner, the Queen's Commissioner to South Africa, said to me
several days before I saw Mr.Kruger that such a thing might come to
pass within the next twenty years.The President hesitated when I asked
him if he favoured such a proposition to unite all the colonies and
republics in the country."If I should say 'Yes,' the English would
declare war on us to-morrow."He appeared to be very cautious on this
subject for a few minutes, but after a consultation with my companions
he spoke more freely."We admire your Government very much," he said, "and think there is none
better in the world.At the present time there are so many conflicting
affairs in this country as to make the discussion of an amalgamation
inadvisable.A republic formed on the principle of the United States
would be most advantageous to all concerned, but South Africa is not yet
ripe for such a government.According to those around him, the President had not been in such a
talkative mood for a long time, and, acting upon that information, I
asked him to tell me concerning the Boers' ability to defend themselves
in case of war with England.Many successes against British arms have
caused the Boers to regard their prowess very highly, and they generally
speak of themselves as well able to protect their country.The two
countries have been on the very verge of war several times during the
last three years, and it was only through the greatest diplomacy that
the thousands of English soldiers were not sent over the border of the
Transvaal, near which they have been stationed ever since the memorable
raid of Jameson's troopers.The President's reply was guarded: "The English say they can starve us
out of our country by placing barriers of soldiers along the borders.Starve us they can, if it is the will of God that such should be our
fate.If God is on our side they can build a big wall around us and we
can still live and flourish.My wish is to live in
peace with everybody."It was evident that the subject was not pleasant to him, and he
requested me to ask Commissioner of War Smidt, a war-scarred hero of
Majuba Hill, to speak to me on the ability of the Boers to take care of
themselves in case of a conflict.Commissioner Smidt became very enthusiastic as he progressed with the
expression of his opinion, and the President frequently nodded assent to
what the head of the War Department said."It is contrary to our national feeling to engage in war," said Mr.Smidt, "and we will do all in our power to avert strife.If, however,
we are forced into fighting, we must defend ourselves as best we are
able.There is not one Boer in the Transvaal who will not fight until
death for his country.We have demonstrated our ability several times,
and we shall try to retain our reputation.The English must fight us in
our own country, where we know every rock, every valley, and every hill.They fight at a disadvantage in a country which they do not know and in
a climate to which they are strangers."The Boers are born sharpshooters, and from infancy are taught to put a
bullet in a buzzard's skull at a hundred yards.One Boer is equal in a
war in our own country to five Englishmen, and that has been proved a
number of times.We have rugged constitutions, are accustomed to an
outdoor life, and can live on a piece of biltong for days, while the
Queen's soldiers have none of these advantages.They can not starve us
out in fifty years, for we have sources of provender of which they can
not deprive us.We have fortifications around Pretoria that make it an
impossibility for any army of less than fifty thousand men to take, and
the ammunition we have on hand is sufficient for a three years' war.We
are not afraid of the English in Africa, and not until every Boer in the
Transvaal is killed will we stop fighting if they ever begin.Should war
come, and I pray that it will not, the Boers will march through English
territory to the Cape of Good Hope, or be erased from the face of the
earth."Never was a man more sincere in his statements than the commissioner,
and his companions supported his every sentence by look and gesture.Even the President gave silent approval to the sentiments expressed."Have you ever had any intention of securing Delagoa Bay from the
Portuguese, in order that you might have a seacoast, as has been
rumoured many times?"Delagoa Bay, the finest
harbour in Africa, is within a few miles of the Transvaal, and might be
of great service to it in the event of war."'Cursed be he who removes the landmarks of his neighbour,'" quoted he."I never want to do anything that would bring the vengeance of God on
me.We want our country, nothing more, nothing less."Asked to give an explanation of the causes of the troubles between
England and the Transvaal, he said:

"Mr.Rhodes is the cause of all the troubles between our country and
England.He desires to form all the country south of the Zambezi River
into a United States of South Africa, and before he can do this he must
have possession of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.His aim in
life is to be President of the United States of South Africa.He
initiated the Jameson raid, and he has stirred up the spirit of
discontent which is being shown by the Englishmen in the Transvaal.Our
Government endeavours to treat every one with like favour, but these
Englishmen are never satisfied with anything we do.They want the
English flag to wave over the Transvaal territory, and nothing less.Rhodes spent millions of pounds in efforts to steal our country, and
will probably spend millions more.But we will never leave this land,
which we found, settled, and protected."Then, rising from his chair and raising his voice, he continued slowly
and deliberately:

"We will fight until not one Boer remains to defend our flag and
country; our women and children will fight for their liberties; and even
I, an old man, will take the gun which I have used against them twice
before and use it again to defend the country I love.But I hope there
will be no war.I want none and the Boers want none.If war comes, we
shall not be to blame.I have done all in my power for peace, and have
taken many insults from Englishmen merely that my people might not be
plunged into war.I hope that I may spend the rest of
my days in peace."The President's carriage had arrived in front of the cottage to convey
him to the Government Building, and the time had arrived for him to
appear before one of the Volksraads.He displayed no eagerness to end
the interview, and continued it by asking me to describe the personality
and ability of President McKinley.He expressed his admiration of
former President Cleveland, with whose Department of State he had some
dealings while John Hays Hammond was confined in the Pretoria prison for
complicity in the Jameson raid.His opinion of the Americans in South Africa was characteristic of the
man.They are a magnificent people,
because they favour justice.When those in our country are untainted
with English ideas I trust them implicitly, but there were a number of
them here in Jameson's time who were Americans in name only."He hesitated to send any message to the sister republic in America, lest
his English enemies might construe it to mean that he curried America's
favour.His friends finally persuaded him to make a statement, and he
dictated this expression of good fellowship and respect:

"So long as the different sections of the United States live in peace
and harmony, so long will they be happy and prosperous.My wish is that
the great republic in America may become the greatest nation on earth,
and that she may continue to act as the great peace nation.I wish that
prosperity may be hers and her people's, and in my daily prayers I ask
that God may protect her and bless her bounteously."It being far past the time for his appearance at the Government
Building, the President ended the interview abruptly.He refilled his
pipe, bade farewell to us, and bustled from the room with all the vigour
of a young man.On the piazza, he met his little, silver-haired wife,
who, with a half-knit stocking pendant from her fingers, was conversing
with the countrymen sitting on the benches.The President bent down and
kissed her affectionately, then jumped into the carriage and was rapidly
conveyed to the Government Building.When the dust obscured the
carriage and the cavalrymen attending it, one of my companions turned to
me and remarked:

"Ah!CHAPTER VII

                           CECIL JOHN RHODES


Sixteen years ago Cecil J. Rhodes, then a man of small means and no
political record, stood in a small Kimberley shop and looked for a long
time at a map of Africa which hung on the wall.An acquaintance who had
watched him for several minutes stepped up to Rhodes and asked whether
he was attempting to find the location of Kimberley.Rhodes made no
reply for several seconds, then placed his right hand over the map, and
covered a large part of South and Central Africa from the Atlantic to
the Indian Ocean.Cecil J. Rhodes on the piazza of his
residence, Groote Schuur, at Rondebosch, near Cape Town.]"I will give you ten years to realize it," replied the friend."Give me ten more," said Rhodes, "and then we'll have a new map."Three fourths of the required time has elapsed, and the full realization
of Rhodes's dream must take place within the next four years.There
remain only two small spaces on that part of the map which was covered
by Rhodes's hand that are not British, and those are the Orange Free
State and the South African Republic.Rhodes's success will come
hand-in-hand with the death of the two republics.The life of the
republics hinges on his failure, and good fortune has rarely deserted
him.Twenty-seven years ago Cecil Rhodes, then a tall, thin college lad, was
directed by his physician to go to South Africa if he wished to live
more than three years.He and his brother Herbert, the sons of the poor
rector of Bishop Stortford, sailed for Durban, Natal, and reached that
port while the diamond fever was at its height at Kimberley.The two
boys, each less than nineteen years old, joined a party of adventurers
and prospectors, and, after many vicissitudes, reached the Kimberley
fields safely, but with little or no money.The boys were energetic,
and found opportunities for making money where others could see none.The camp was composed of the roughest characters in South Africa, all of
whom had flocked thither when the discovery of diamonds was first
announced.Illicit diamond buying was the easiest path to wealth, and
was travelled by almost every millionaire whose name has been connected
with recent South African affairs.Rhodes is one of the few
exceptions, and even his enemies corroborate the statement."You don't steal diamonds," said Barney Barnato to Mr.Rhodes fifteen
years ago, "but you must prove it when accused.I steal them, but my
enemies must prove it.The youthful Rhodes engaged in many legitimate schemes for making money,
and saved almost all that he secured.For a short time he pumped water
out of mines, using an abandoned engine for the purpose, and then
embarked in commercial enterprises.After spending two or three years
in the fields, he returned to England and resumed his course at Oxford.In connection with this visit to England, Mr.Rhodes relates the story
of the meeting with the physician who several years before had placed
the limit of his existence at three years.asked the discomfited doctor when he saw the
healthy young man."According to my books, you have been in your grave
some time.Here is the entry: 'Tuberculosis; recovery impossible.'You
can't be the same Rhodes, sir.At the end of each term at Oxford Mr.Rhodes returned to Kimberley, and,
by judiciously investing his savings in mining claims, soon became a
power in the affairs of the diamond fields.When the diamond fever was
followed by the usual reaction, and evil days fell upon the industry,
Mr.Rhodes secured all the shares, claims, and lands that his thousands
would buy.Then he conceived the idea of making a monopoly of the
diamond industry by consolidating all the mines and limiting the output.Lacking the money wherewith to buy the valuable properties necessary for
his plans, he went to the Rothschilds and asked for financial
assistance.The scheme was extraordinary, and required such a large
amount of money that the request, coming from such a young man as Mr.Rhodes was then, staggered the Rothschilds, and they asked him to call
several days later for an answer."I will
come again in an hour for your answer.If you have not decided by that
time, I shall seek assistance elsewhere."Rhodes back to Africa with the necessary amount
of money to purchase the other claims and property in the Kimberley
district, and, after he had formed the great De Beers Company, appointed
him managing director for life at a salary of one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars a year.Rhodes's management the De Beers
consolidated mines have been earning annual dividends of almost fifty
per cent., and more than four hundred million dollars' worth of diamonds
have been placed on the market.With the exception of the Suez Canal,
the mines are the best paying property in the world, and much of their
success is due to the personal efforts of Mr.It was while he was engineering the consolidation of the diamond mines
that Mr.He realized that his
political success was founded on personal popularity, and more firmly so
in a new country, where the political elements were of such a
diversified character as are usually present in a mining community.In
the early days of the Kimberley fields the extent of a man's popularity
depended upon the amount of money he spent in wining those around him.Rhodes was astute enough to appreciate the secret of popularity,
and, having gained it, allowed himself to be named as candidate for the
Cape Colony Parliament from the Kimberley district.By carefully currying the favour of the Dutch inhabitants, who were not
on the friendliest political terms with the English colonists, he was
elected.Rhodes's political star was in the ascendant,
and he was elected successively to the highest office in the colony's
government.At the age of twenty-eight he was Treasurer-General of Cape Colony, and
it was while he filled that office that Chinese Gordon appeared at the
Cape and appealed to Mr.Rhodes to join the expedition to Khartoum.Rhodes was undecided whether to resign the treasurer-generalship and
accompany Gordon or to remain in South Africa, but finally determined to
stay in the colony.Gordon, who had taken a great fancy to the young
and energetic colonist, was sorely disappointed, and went to Khartoum,
where he was killed.During the years he held minor Government offices Mr.Rhodes formed the
alliances which were the foundation of his later political success.He
was a friend at the same time of the Englishman, the Afrikander, the
Dutchman, and the Boer, and he was always in a position where he could
reciprocate the favours of one class without incurring the enmity of
another.He worked with the Dutchmen when protection was the political
cry, and with the Englishmen when subjects dear to them were in the
foreground.He never abused his opponents in political arguments, as
the majority of Cape politicians do, but he pleaded with them on the
veldt and at their firesides.When he was unable to swerve a man's opinions by words, he has
frequently been charged with having applied the more seductive method of
using money.Rhodes is said to be a firm believer in money as a
force superior to all others, and he does not hesitate to acknowledge
his belief that every man's opinions can be shaped by the application of
a necessary amount of money.This belief he formed in the early days of
the diamond fields, and it has remained with him ever since."Find the man's price" was Mr.Rhodes's formula for success before he
reached the age of thirty, and his political enemies declare it has
given him the power he desired.In a country which had such a large
roving and reckless population as South Africa it was not difficult for
a politician with a motto similar to that of Mr.Rhodes's to become
influential at election periods, nor did it require many years to
establish a party that would support him on whatever grounds he chose to
take.Rhodes commenced his higher
political career in Cape Colony.When, in 1884, he became Commissioner
of Bechuanaland, the vast and then undeveloped country adjoining the
colony on the north, and made his first plans for the annexation of that
territory to the British Empire, he received the support of the majority
of the voters of the colony.His first plan of securing control of the
territory was not favourably received by the Colonial Office in London,
and no sooner was it pronounced visionary than he suggested another more
feasible.Bechuanaland was then ruled by a mighty native chief, Lobengula, whose
vast armies roved over the country and prevented white travellers and
prospectors from crossing the bounds of his territory.In the minds of
the white people of South Africa, Bechuanaland figured as a veritable
Golconda--a land where precious stones and minerals could be secured
without any attendant labour, where the soil was so rich as to yield
four bounteous harvests every year.Rhodes determined to break the barriers which excluded white men
from the native chief's domain, and sent three agents to treat with
Lobengula.The agents made many valuable presents to the old chief, and
in 1888, after much engineering, secured from him an exclusive
concession to search for and extract minerals in Bechuanaland.The
payment for the concession included five hundred dollars a month, a
thousand rifles and ammunition, and a small gunboat on the Zambezi.Rhodes discovered the real value of the concession, he and a
number of his friends formed the British South Africa Company, popularly
known as the Chartered Company, and received a charter from the British
Government, which gave to them the exclusive right of governing,
developing, and trading in Lobengula's country.Several years afterward
the white man's government became irksome to Lobengula and his tribes,
as well as to the Mashonas, who occupied the immense territory adjoining
Bechuanaland on the east, and all rebelled.The result was not unlike
those of native rebellions in other countries.The natives were shot
down by trained English soldiers, their country was taken from them, and
those who escaped death or captivity were compelled to fly for safety to
the new countries of the north.The British South Africa Company in 1895 practically became the sole
owner of Rhodesia, the great territory taken from Lobengula and the
Mashonas; and Mr.Rhodes, having realized part of his dream, began
casting about for other opportunities whereby he might extend the
empire.Rhodes was then in the zenith of his glory.He was many times a
millionaire, the head of one of the greatest capitalistic enterprises in
the world, the director of the affairs of a dominion occupying one tenth
of a continent, and the Premier of Cape Colony.His power was almost
absolute over a territory that stretches from the Cape of Good Hope into
Central Africa, and then eastward to within a few miles of the Indian
Ocean.He had armies under his command, and two governments were at his
beck and call.He looked again at the map of Africa,
already greatly changed since he placed his hand over it in the
Kimberley shop, but the dream was not realized.He saw the Transvaal
and the Orange Free State flags still occupying the positions he had
marked for the British emblem, and he plotted for their acquisition.The strife between the Boers and the Uitlanders in the Transvaal was
then at its height, and Mr.Rhodes recognised the opportunity for the
intervention of England that it afforded.Rhodes did not consider it
of sufficient importance to inquire concerning the justice of the
Uitlanders' claims, nor did he express any sympathy for their cause.In
fact, if anything, he felt that if the Uitlanders were unjustly treated
by the Boers their remedy was simple.Once he blandly told a complaining
Uitlander that no Chinese wall surrounded the Transvaal, and that to
escape from the alleged injustice was comparatively easy.Rhodes the end was sufficient excuse for the means, and, if the
acquisition of the two republics carried with it the loss of his Boer
friends, he was willing to accept the situation.The fall of the
Transvaal Republic carried with it the subsequent fall of the Orange
Free State, and, in order that he might strike at the head, he
determined to commence his campaign of exterminating republics by first
attacking the Transvaal.Whether he had the promise of assistance from the Colonial Office in
London is a subject upon which even the principals differ.Rhodes
felt that his power in the country was great enough to make the attack
upon the Transvaal without assistance from the home Government, and the
plot of the Jameson raid was formed.He retired to Groote Schuur, his home at Cape Town, and awaited the
fruition of the plans he had so carefully made and explained.His
lieutenants might have been overhasty, or perhaps the Uitlanders in
Johannesburg might have feared the Boer guns too much; whatever the
reason, the plans miscarried, and Mr.Rhodes experienced the first and
greatest reverse in his brilliant public career.The dream which appeared so near realization one day was dissolved the
next, and with it the reputation of the dreamer.He was obliged to
resign the premiership of Cape Colony, many of his best and oldest
supporters in England deserted him, and he lost the respect and esteem
of the Dutch inhabitants of South Africa, who had always been among his
stanchest allies.The heroic Rhodes, the idol of Cape Colony, found
himself the object of attack and ridicule of the majority of the voters
of the colony.The parliamentary inquiry acquitted him of all
complicity in the Jameson raid, it is true, but the Dutch people of
South Africa never have and never will.The Jameson raid was a mere incident in Mr.Rhodes's career; he would
probably call it an accident.Having failed to overthrow the Transvaal
Republic by means of an armed revolution, he attempted to accomplish the
same object by means of a commercial revolution.Rhodesia, the new
country which had a short time previously been taken from the Matabeles
and the Mashonas, was proclaimed by Mr.Rhodes to be a paradise for
settlers and an Ophir for prospectors.He personally conducted the
campaign to rob the Transvaal of its inhabitants and its commerce; but
the golden promises, the magnificent farms, the Solomon's mines, the new
railways, and the new telegraph lines all failed to attract the coveted
prizes to the land which, after all, was found to be void of real merit
except as a hunting ground where the so-called British poor-house, the
army, might pot <DW64>s.Rhodes spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in developing the
country which bears his name, and the British South Africa Company added
thousands more, but the hand which was wont to turn into gold all that
it touched had lost its cunning.Rhodes's perplexities,
the natives who had been conquered by Dr.Jameson learned that their
conqueror had been taken prisoner by the Boers, and rose in another
rebellion against English authority.Rhodes and one of his sisters
journeyed alone into the enemy's stronghold and made terms with
Lobengula, whereby the revolution was practically ended.After the Rhodesian country had been pacified, and he had placed the
routine work of the campaign to secure settlers for the country in the
hands of his lieutenants, Mr.Rhodes bent all his energies toward the
completion of the transcontinental railway and telegraph lines which had
been started under his auspices several years before, but had been
allowed to lag on account of the pressure of weightier matters.The
Cape Town to Cairo railroad and telegraph are undertakings of such vast
proportions and importance that Mr.Rhodes's fame might easily have been
secured through them alone had he never been heard of in connection with
other great enterprises.He himself originated the plans by which the Mediterranean and Table Bay
will eventually be united by bands of steel and strands of copper, and
it is through his own personal efforts that the English financiers are
being induced to subscribe the money with which his plans are being
carried out.The marvellous faith which the English people have in Mr.Rhodes has been illustrated on several occasions when he was called to
London to meet storms of protests from shareholders, who feared that the
two great enterprises were gigantic fiascos.He has invariably returned
to South Africa with the renewed confidence of the timid ones and many
millions of additional capital.Rhodes has tasted of the power which is absolute, and he will brook
no earthly interference with his plans.The natives may destroy
hundreds of miles of the telegraph lines, as they have done on several
occasions.He teaches them a lesson by means of the quick-firing gun,
and rebuilds the line.White men may fear the deadly fever of Central
Africa, but princely salaries and life-insurance policies for a host of
relatives will always attract men to take the risk.Shareholders may
rebel at the expenditures, but Mr.Rhodes will indicate to them that
their other properties will be ruined if they withdraw their support
from the railway and telegraph.A strip of territory belonging to another nation may be an impediment to
the line, but an interview with the Emperor of Germany or the King of
Portugal will be all-sufficient for the accomplishment of Mr.Providence may swerve him in his purpose many times, but
nations and individuals rarely.Rhodes is the most remarkable
Englishman that ever figured in the history of the African continent.Some will go further and declare that he has done more for the British
Empire than any one man in history.No two South Africans will agree on
the methods by which Mr.Rhodes attained his position in the affairs of
the country.Some say that he owes his success to his great wealth;
others declare that his personal magnetism is responsible for all that
he ever attained.His enemies intimate that political chicanery is the
foundation of his progress, while his friends resent the intimation and
laud his sterling honesty as the basis of his successful career.No one has ever accused him of being the fortunate victim of
circumstances which carried him to the pre-eminent rank he occupies
among Englishmen, although such an opinion might readily be formed from
a personal study of the man.South Africa is the indolent man's
paradise, and of that garden of physical inactivity Mr.Rhodes, by
virtue of his pre-eminent qualifications, is king."Almost as lazy as
Rhodes" is a South Africanism that has caused lifelong enmities and
rivers of blood.He takes pride in his indolence, and declares that the man who performs
more labour than his physical needs demand is a fool.He says he never
makes a long speech because he is too lazy to expend the energy
necessary for its delivery.He declines to walk more than an eighth of
a mile unless it is impossible to secure a vehicle or native
hammock-bearers to convey him, and then he proceeds so slowly that his
progress is almost imperceptible.His indolence may be the result of
the same line of reasoning as that indulged in by the cautious man who
carries an umbrella when the sun shines, in which case every one who has
travelled in the tropics will agree that Mr.The only exercise he indulges in is an hour's canter on horseback in the
early morning, before the generous rays of the African sun appear.Notwithstanding his antipathy to physical exertion, Mr.Rhodes is a
great traveller, and is constantly moving from one place to another.One week may find him at Groote Schuur, his Cape Town residence, while
the following week he may be planning a new farm in far-away
Mashonaland.The third week may have him in the Portuguese possessions
on the east coast, and at the end of the month he may be back in Cape
Town, prepared for a voyage to England and a fortnight's stay in Paris.He will charter a bullock team or a steamship with like disregard of
expense in order that he may reach his destination at a specified time,
and in like manner he will be watchful of his comfort by causing houses
to be built in unfrequented territory which he may wish to investigate.So wealthy that he could almost double his fortune in the time it would
require to count it, Mr.Rhodes is a firm believer in the doctrine that
money was created for the purpose of being spent, and never hesitates to
put it into practice.He does not assist beggars, nor does he squander
sixpence in a year, but he will pay the expenses of a trip to Europe for
a man whom he wishes to reconcile, and will donate the value of a
thousand-acre farm to a tribe of natives which has pleased him by its
actions.His generosity is best illustrated by a story told by one of his most
intimate friends in Kimberley.Several years before Barney Barnato's
death, that not-too-honest speculator induced almost all of the
employees of the diamond mines to invest their savings in the stock of
the Pleiades gold mine in Johannesburg, which Barnato and his friends
were attempting to manipulate.The attempt was unsuccessful, and the
diamond miners lost all the money they had invested.Rhodes heard
of Barnato's deceit, and asked him to refund the money, but was laughed
at.Rhodes learned the total amount of the losses--about
twenty-five thousand dollars--and paid the money out of his own pocket.Although he has more financial patronage at his command than almost any
banking house in existence, Mr.Rhodes rarely has sufficient money in
his purse to buy lunch.His valet, a half-breed Malay named Tony, is
his banker, and from him he is continually borrowing money.It is
related that on a voyage to England he offered to make a wager of money,
but found that he had nothing less valuable than a handful of loose
rough diamonds in his trousers pocket.Rhodes is an eloquently silent man.He talks little, but his paucity
of words is no criterion of their weight.He can condense a chapter
into a word, and a book into a sentence.The man whose hobby is to run
an empire is almost as silent as the Sphinx in the land toward which
that empire is being elongated."I
want a railroad here," or "We want this mine," or "We must have this
strip of land," are common examples of his style of speech and the
expression of his dominant spirit.He has the faculty of leading people to believe that they want the exact
opposite of what they really want, and he does it in such a polished
manner that they give their consent before they realize what he has
asked them.His personal charm, which in itself is almost irresistible,
is fortified with a straight-forward, breezy heartiness, that carries
with it respect, admiration, confidence, and, finally, conviction.He
has argued and treated with persons ranging in intelligence and station
from a native chief to the most learned diplomats and rulers in the
world, and his experience has taught him that argument will win any
case.Lobengula called him "the brother who eats a whole country for his
dinner."To this title might be added "the debater who swallows up the
opposition in one breath."Rhodes never asks exactly what he wants.He will ask the shareholders of a company for ten million, when he
really needs only five million, but in that manner he is almost certain
of satisfying his needs.In the same way when he pleads with an
opponent he makes the demands so great that he can afford to yield half
and still attain his object.Rhodes demanded the
appointment of Prime Minister of the Colony, but he was satisfied with
the Commissionership of Crown Lands and Works, the real object of his
aim.Rhodes had cast his lines in America instead of South Africa, he
would be called a political boss.He would be the dominant factor of
one of the parties, and he would be able to secure delegates with as
much ease as he does in Cape Colony, where the population is less mixed
than in our country.His political lieutenants act with the same vigour
and on the same general lines as those in our country, and if a close
examination of their work could be made, many political tricks that the
American campaigner never heard of would probably be disclosed.One of the mildest accusations against him is that he paid fifty
thousand dollars for the support that first secured for him a seat in
the Cape Colony Parliament, but he has never considered it worth the
time to deny the report.His political success depends in no little
measure upon his personal acquaintanceship with the small men of his
party, and his method of treating them with as much consideration and
respect as those who have greater influence.He is in constant
communication with the leaders of the rural communities, and misses no
opportunity to show his appreciation of their support.Rhodes may
be kingly when he is among kings, but he is also a farmer among farmers,
and among the Cape Dutch and Boers such a metamorphosis is the necessary
stepping-stone to the hearts and votes of that numerous people.Rhodes among a party of farmers or transport
riders each one of whom has better clothing than the multimillionaire.Rhodes wore a hat which was so
shabby that it became the subject of newspaper importance.When he is in
Rhodesia he dons the oldest suit of clothing in his wardrobe, and
follows the habits of the pioneers who are settling the country.He
sleeps in a native kraal when he is not near a town, and eats of the
same canned beef and crackers that his Chartered Company serves to its
mounted police.When he is in that primeval country he despises
ostentation and displays in his honour, and will travel fifty miles on
horseback in an opposite direction in order to avoid a formal proceeding
of any nature.Two years ago, when the railroad to Buluwayo, the
capital of Rhodesia, was formally opened, Mr.Rhodes telegraphed his
regrets, and intimated that he was ill.As a matter of fact he
travelled night and day in order to escape to a place where telegrams
and messages could not reach him.When his host suggested that he was
missing many entertainments and the society of the most distinguished
men of South Africa, Mr.Rhodes smiled and said: "For that reason I
escaped."Formality bores him, and he would rather live a month coatless and
collarless in a native kraal with an old colony story-teller than spend
half an hour at a state dinner in the governor's mansion.It is related
in this connection that Mr.Rhodes was one of a distinguished party who
attended the opening of a railroad extension near Cape Town.While the
speeches were being made, and the chairman was trying to find him, Mr.Rhodes slipped quietly away, and was discovered discarding his clothing
preparatory to enjoying a bath in a near-by creek.Rhodes is unmarried, and throughout the country has the reputation
of being an avowed hater of women.He believes that a woman is an
impediment to a man's existence until he has attained the object and aim
of his life, and has become deserving of luxuries.He not only believes
in that himself, but takes advantage of every opportunity to impress the
belief upon the minds of those around him.In the summer of 1897 a
captain in the volunteer army, and one of his most faithful lieutenants
in Mashonaland, asked Mr.Rhodes for a three months' leave of absence to
go to Cape Colony.The captain had been through many native campaigns,
and richly deserved a vacation, although that was not the real object of
his request for leave.The man wanted to go to Cape Colony to marry,
and by severe cross-examination Mr.Rhodes learned that such was the
case."I can not let you go to Cape Colony; I want you to start for London
to-morrow.I'll cable instructions when you arrive there," said Mr.Rhodes, and the wedding was postponed.When the captain reached London,
a cablegram from Mr.Rhodes said simply, "Study London for three
months."Nowhere in South Africa is there anything more interesting than Groote
Schuur, the country residence of Mr.Rhodes, at Rondebosch, a suburb of
Cape Town.He has found time amid his momentous public duties to make
his estate the most magnificent on the continent of Africa.Besides a
mansion which is a relic of the first settlers of the peninsula, and now
a palace worthy of a king's occupancy, there is an estate which consists
of hundreds of acres of land overlooking both the Atlantic and Indian
Oceans, and under the walls of Table Mountain, the curio of a country.In addition to this, there are a zooelogical collection, which comprises
almost every specimen of African fauna that will thrive in captivity,
and hundreds of flowering trees and plants brought from great distances
to enrich the beauty of the landscape.The estate, which comprises almost twelve hundred acres, is situated
about five miles to the north of Cape Town, on the narrowest part of the
peninsula, through which the waters of the two oceans seem ever anxious
to rush and clasp hands.It lies along the northwestern base of Table
Mountain, and stretches down toward the waters of Table Bay and
northward toward the death-dealing desert known as the Great Karroo.From one of the shady streets winding toward Cape Town there stretches a
fine avenue of lofty pines and oaks to the mansion of Groote Schuur,
which, as its name indicates, was originally a granary, where two
hundred years ago the Dutch colonizers hoarded their stores of grain and
guarded them against the attacks of thieving natives.Although many changes have been made in the structure since it was
secured by Mr.Rhodes, it still preserves the quaint architectural
characteristics of Holland.The scrolled gables, moulded chimney pots,
and wide verandas, or "stoeps," are none the less indicative of the
tendencies of the old settlers than the Dutch cabinets, bureaus, and
other household furniture that still remains in the mansion from those
early days.The entire estate breathes of the old Dutch era.Everything has the
ancient setting, although not at the expense of modern convenience.While the buildings and grounds are arranged in the picturesque style of
Holland, the furnishings and comforts are the most modern that the
countries of Europe afford.The library contains, besides such classics
as a graduate of Oxford would have, one of the largest collections of
books and manuscripts bearing on Africa in existence.In the same room
is a museum of souvenirs connected with Mr.Rhodes's work of extending
English empire toward the heart of the continent.There are flags
captured in wars with the Portuguese, Union Jacks riddled with shot and
cut by assegai, and hundreds of curiosities gathered in Rhodesia after
the conquest of the natives.In this building have gathered for
conference the men who laid the foundations for all the great
enterprises of South Africa.There the Jameson raid was planned, it is
said, and there, the Boers say, the directors of the British South
Africa Chartered Company were drinking champagne while the forces of Dr.Jameson were engaged in mortal combat with those of Kruger near
Johannesburg.Surrounding the mansion are most beautiful gardens, such as can be found
only in semi-tropical climates.In the foreground of the view from the
back part of the house is a Dutch garden, rising in three terraces from
the marble-paved courtyard to a grassy knoll, fringed with tall pines,
and dotted here and there with graves of former dwellers at Groote
Schuur.Behind the pine fringe, but only at intervals obscured by it, is
the background of the picture--the bush-clad <DW72>s of Table Mountain
and the Devil's Peak, near enough for every detail of their strange
formations and innumerable attractions to be observed.Art and Nature
have joined hands everywhere to make lovely landscapes, in which the
colour effects are produced by hydrangeas, azaleas, and scores of other
flowers, growing in the utmost profusion.Besides the mimosa, palms,
firs, and other tropical trees that add beauty to the grounds, there is
a low tree which is found nowhere else on earth.Its leaves are like
the purest silver, and form a charming contrast to the deep green of the
firs and the vivid brightness of the flowers that are everywhere around.Undoubtedly, however, the most interesting feature of the estate is the
natural zooelogical garden.It is quite unique to have in this immense
park, with drives six miles in length and ornamentations brought
thousands of miles, wild animals of every variety wandering about with
as much freedom as if they were in their native haunts.In this
collection are represented every kind of African deer and antelope.Zebra, kangaroo, giraffe, emu, pheasant, and ostrich seem to be
perfectly contented with their adopted home, and have become so tame
that the presence of human beings has no terrors for them.Rhodes several million dollars to bring
to its present condition, sees but little of the former Premier of Cape
Colony.His vast enterprises in the diamond fields of Kimberley and in
the new country which bears his name require so much of his time that he
but seldom visits it.But his inability to enjoy the product of his
brain and labour does not cause the estate to be unappreciated, for he
has thrown this unique and charming pleasure resort open to the public,
and by them it is regarded as a national possession.CHAPTER VIII

                THE BOER GOVERNMENT--CIVIL AND MILITARY


The Constitution, or Grondwet, of the South African Republic is a
modified counterpart of that of the United States.It differs in some
salient features, but in its entirety it has the same general foundation
and the same objects.The executive head of the Government is the
President, who is elected for a term of five years.He directs the
policy of the Government, suggests the trend of the laws, and oversees
the conduct of the Executive Council, which constitutes the real
Government.The Executive Council consists of three heads of
departments and six unofficial members of the First Raad.These nine
officials are the authors of all laws, treaties, and policies that are
proposed to the Volksraads, which constitute the third part of the
Government.There are two Volksraads, one similar in purpose to our
Senate, and the other, the second Volksraad, not unlike our House of
Representatives, but with far less power.The first Volksraad consists of twenty-seven members elected from and by
the burghers, or voters, who were born in the country.A naturalized
burgher is ineligible to the upper House.The twenty-seven members of
the Second Raad are naturalized burghers, and are voted for only by men
who have received the franchise.The second House has control of the
management of the Government works, telephones, mails, and mines, and
has but little voice in the real government of the country.Its members
are undoubtedly more progressive and have more modern ideas than those
of the First Raad, and introduce many bills which would be of undoubted
benefit to the country, but the upper House invariably vetoes all bills
that reach them from that Raad.The First Raad receives bills and
suggestions from the Executive Council or from the President himself,
but refers them to a commission for investigation before any action is
taken upon them.The evidence in support of proposed measures does not
reach the Raad, which only concerns itself with the report of the
commission.The Raad can, by motion, make a suggestion to the Executive
Council that a certain measure should be formulated, but the Executive
Council and the President have the authority to ignore the suggestion,
leaving the First Raad without a vestige of authority.The upper House
concerns itself chiefly with the questions of finance, changes in the
Constitution, and the care of the natives.As the question of finance
is so closely connected with almost every subject that comes before the
Government, it follows that the First Raad concerns itself with
practically the entire business of the Government.The popular
conception is that the Second Raad, being composed of naturalized
citizens, takes less interest in the affairs of the country, and can
therefore be less safely trusted with their conduct than the old
burghers and Voortrekkers of the upper House, who would rather declare
war against a foreign power than pass a law in the least unfavourable to
their own country's interests.In consequence of the Second Raad's
infinitesimal powers, almost the entire law-making power of the
Government is vested in the Executive Council and the First Raad.The
First Raad of the Transvaal Republic is the direct successor of the
democratic form of government that was established by the Voortrekkers
of 1835 when they were journeying from Cape Colony to the northern
lands.The Second Raad was established in 1890, in order that the
Uitlanders might have representation in the government of the country.It was believed that the newly arrived population would take advantage
of the opportunities thus offered to take part in the legislation of the
republic, and in that way bridge over the gulf which had been formed
between the two races.The Uitlanders cared little for the privilege
offered to them, and so far in the history of the Second Raad less than
half a score of its members have been elected by the new population.The annual sessions of the Volksraads commence on the first Monday in
May, and continue until all the business of the republic has been
transacted.The members of the two Houses receive fifteen dollars a
day, and seventy-five cents an hour for services extending over more
than the five hours a day required by the law.The chairmen, or
voorzitters, of the Raads receive seventeen dollars and fifty cents a
day, and one dollar an hour for extra time.The sessions of the Raad are held in the new million-dollar Government
House in the central part of the town of Pretoria, and are open to the
public except when executive business is being transacted.The Raad
chambers are exquisitely fitted out with rich furniture and tapestries,
the windows are of costly stained glass, and the walls lavishly
decorated with carved wood and fine paintings of the country's notable
men.On a lofty elevation facing the entrance to the First Raad chamber
is a heavily carved mahogany desk, behind which is seated the chairman.On his right is a seat for the President, while on the right side of
that are the nine chairs for the Executive Council.Directly in front
and beneath the chairman's desk are the desks of the three official
secretaries, and in front of these, in semicircular form, the two rows
of seats and desks of the Raad members.In the rear of the chamber on
either side of the entrance are chairs for visitors, while high in the
left side of the lofty chamber is a small balcony for the newspaper men.All the members of the Raad are obliged by law to wear black clothing
and white neckties.This law was framed to prevent some of the rural
members from appearing in their burgher costumes, and has had the effect
of making of the Boer Raads a most sombre-looking body of lawmakers.Almost all members wear long frock-coats, silk hats, and heavy black
boots, and when, during the recesses, they appear on the piazza of the
Government Building with huge pipes in their mouths, the wisdom of the
black-clothing law is not apparent.There is little formality in the
proceedings of the Raads.Certain rules are necessarily followed, but
the members attack a bill in much the same vehement manner as they would
a lion or a panther.There is little eloquence in the taal, or dialect,
that is spoken in the Raads, and the similes and metaphors bespeak the
open veldt and the transport path rather than the council chamber of a
nation.The black-garbed legislators make no pretensions to dignified procedure,
and when a playful member trips another so that he falls to the floor,
or pelts him with paper balls, the whole Raad joins in laughter.The
gaudily dressed pages--one of them is sixty-five years old and wears a
long beard--are on terms of great familiarity with the members, and have
become mildly famous throughout the country on account of some practical
jokes they have perpetrated upon the members.It is only justice to say
that these light proceedings take place only when the President is not
present.When he arrives in the chamber every one rises and remains
standing until the President has seated himself.He generally takes a
deep interest in the subjects before the House, and not infrequently
speaks at length upon measures for which he desires a certain line of
action.Many of President Kruger's most important speeches have been
delivered to the Raads, and so great is his influence over the members
that his wishes are rarely disregarded.When he meets with opposition
to his views he quickly loses his temper, and upon one occasion called a
certain member who opposed him a traitor, and angrily left the chamber.A short time afterward he returned and apologized to the member and to
the Raad for having in his anger used unseemly language.One of the most disappointing scenes to be observed in Pretoria is the
horde of Uitlander politicians and speculators who are constantly
besieging the Raad members and the Government officials.At probably no
other national capital are the legislators tempted to such a great
extent as are the Boers, who, for the most part, are ignorant of the
ways of the world and unfamiliar with great amounts of money.Every
train from Johannesburg, the Uitlander capital, takes to Pretoria scores
of lobbyists, who use all their powers, both of persuasion and finance,
to influence the minds of the legislators, either in the way of granting
valuable concessions for small considerations or of securing the passage
of bills favourable to the lobbyists.It is no wonder that the
Uitlanders declare that less than one fourth of the Raad members are
unassailably honest and that all the others can be bribed.The Boer
alone is not blameworthy who, having never possessed more than one
hundred dollars at one time, yields to the constant importunities of the
lobbyist and sells his vote for several thousand dollars.Beset by such influences, the Raad members are naturally suspicious of
every bill that is brought before them for consideration.Their
deliberations are marked by a feeling of insecurity akin to that
displayed by the inhabitants of a sheep-pen surrounded by a pack of
hungry wolves.They fear to make a move in any direction lest their
motives be misunderstood, or they play into the hands of the Uitlanders.As a consequence of this external pressure, progress in the improvement
of the methods of governing the country has been slow.One of the
results of the Volksraad's fearfulness is the absence of local
governments throughout the republic.There are no municipalities,
counties, or townships which can formulate and execute local laws.Even
Johannesburg, a city of one hundred thousand population, has no
municipal government, although several attempts have been made to
establish one.The Raads are burdened with the necessity of attending to all the
details which govern the administration of every city, village, hamlet,
and district in the entire country, and the time consumed in doing all
this leaves little for the weightier affairs of state.If a five-dollar
road bridge is required in an out-of-the-way place in the northern part
of the republic, the Raad is obliged to discuss the matter.If an
application for a liquor license comes from a distant point in the
interior, the Raad is compelled to investigate its character before it
can be voted upon.The disadvantages of this system are so evident that
it is hardly conceivable that no remedy has been applied long ago, but
the fear of local mismanagement has prevented the Raad from ridding
itself of this encumbrance upon its time and patience.Every legislature of whatever country has its idiosyncracies, and the
Raad is no exception.Laws are upon the statute books of some of the
American States that are quite as remarkable as some of those made by
the Boer legislators.Bills quite as marvellous have been introduced
and defeated in the legislatures of all countries.The Boer Volksraad
has no monopoly of men with quaint ideas.The examples of Raad
workmanship here given are rare, but true nevertheless:

A man named Dums, whose big farm on the border became British territory
through a treaty, sued the Transvaal Government for damages, whereupon
the Raad passed a law that Dums could never sue the Government for
anything.The High Court sustained the law, and Dums is now a poor
cab-driver in Pretoria.Another man sued the Government for damages for
injuries resulting from a fall in the street.He was successful in his
suit, but the Raad immediately thereafter passed a law making it
impossible for any person to sue the Government for injuries received on
public property.During a severe drought in the Transvaal an American professional
rain-maker asked the Raad for a concession allowing him the exclusive
privilege to precipitate rain by means of explosives in the air.The
Raad had a long and animated discussion on the subject, owing to the
opposition of several of the less enlightened members, who declared that
the project was sacrilegious."It is a sin," they declared, "to poke
your fingers in the Lord's eye to make him weep."The abiding faith
which some of the Raad members have in divine guidance is illustrated by
a discussion that took place in the body shortly after the Jameson raid.One member declared that "the Lord will assist us in this matter if we
will only bide our time," whereupon another member rose and said, "If we
do not soon get down to business and do something without the Lord's
assistance, the Lord will take a holiday and let the Transvaal go to
hell."A law which was in effect for almost two years made it a
misdemeanour for any one to sing "God save the Queen" or "Rule
Britannia" in the country.Mass meetings are prohibited in the
Transvaal, but Germany and other countries with less political foment
have equally stringent regulations on the same subject, so the
Uitlanders' grievance on that account is nullified.Second to that of the Volksraad, the highest power in the Government of
the country is the High Court, which is composed of some of the ablest
jurists in South Africa.From a constitutional standpoint the High
Court has no right or power to review the acts of the Volksraad.The
Constitution of the country gives supreme power to the Volksraad in all
legislative matters, and when a chief justice of the High Court recently
attempted to extend his jurisdiction over the acts of the Volksraad that
body unceremoniously dismissed him.The purpose of that part of the
Constitution which relates to the subjugation of the High Court is to
prevent some influential enemy of the republic from debauching the High
Court and in that way defying the authority of the Volksraad.In a
country which has so many peculiar conditions and circumstances to
contend with, the safety of its institutions depends upon the
centralization of its legislative and administrative branches, and the
wisdom of the early burghers who framed the Constitution so that the
entire governing power lay in the hands of the country's real patriots
has been amply demonstrated upon several occasions.The civil and criminal laws of the country are administered throughout
the different political divisions by local magistrates, called
land-drosts, who also collect the revenues of the district and inform
the Volksraad of the needs of the people under their jurisdiction.The
land-drost is the prototype of the old-time American country squire, in
that he settles disputes, awards damages, and conducts official business
generally.In the majority of cases the land-drosts are aged persons
who have the respect and esteem of the members of the community in which
they dwell and to whom they bear the relation of fatherly advisers in
all things.In Johannesburg and Pretoria the land-drosts are men of
eminent station in the legal profession of South Africa, and are drawn
from all parts of the country, regardless of their political or racial
qualifications.All the court proceedings are conducted in the Dutch
language, and none but Dutch-speaking lawyers are admitted to practise
before the bar.The law of the land is Holland-Roman.The military branch of the Government is undoubtedly the best and most
effective because it is the simplest.It is almost primitive in its
simplicity, yet for effectiveness its superior is not easily found.The
Transvaal glories in its army, and, as every man between the ages of
sixteen and sixty is a nominal member of the army, nothing is left
undone to make it worthy of its glory.The standing army of the
republic numbers less than two hundred men, and these are not always
actively engaged.A detachment of about twenty soldiers is generally on
duty in the vicinity of the Government House at Pretoria, and the others
are stationed at the different forts throughout the republic.The real
army of the Transvaal, however, is composed of the volunteer soldiers,
who can be mobilized with remarkable facility.The head of the army is the commandant-general, who has his headquarters
in Pretoria.He is under the immediate jurisdiction of the Volksraad and
the President, who have the power to declare war and direct its conduct.Second in authority to the commandant-general are the commandants,
permanent officials who have charge of the military affairs of the
seventeen districts of the republic.Under the old South African
burgher law each commandant in any emergency "commandeers" a certain
portion of men from his district.The various districts are subdivided into divisions in charge of
field-cornets and assistant field-cornets.As soon as the
commandant-general issues an order for the mobilization of the volunteer
army the commandants and their assistants, the field-cornets, speedily
go from one house to another in their districts and summon the burghers
from their homes.When the burgher receives the call, he provides his
own gun, horse, and forage, and hastens to the district rendezvous,
where he places himself under the orders of the field-cornet.After all
the burghers of the district have gathered together, the body proceeds
into an adjoining district, where it joins the forces that have been
similarly mobilized there.As a certain number of districts are obliged
to join their forces at a defined locality, the forces of the republic
are consequently divided into different army divisions under the
supervisions of the commandants.In the event that Pretoria were threatened with attack, the order would
be given to move all the forces to that city.The districts on the
border would gather their men and march toward Pretoria, carrying with
them all the forces of the districts through which they were obliged to
pass.So simple and perfect is the system that within forty-eight hours
after the call is issued by the commandant-general four army divisions,
representing the districts in the four quarters of the republic and
consisting of all the able-bodied men in the country, can be mobilized
on the outskirts of Pretoria.It is doubtful whether there is another
nation on earth that can gather its entire fighting strength at its seat
of government in such a brief time.The Transvaal Boer is constantly prepared for the call to arms.He has
his own rifle and ammunition at his home, and when the call comes he
need only bridle his horse--if he is so fortunate as to possess an
animal so rare in the Transvaal--stuff several pounds of biltong, or
dried beef, in his pockets, and commence the march over the veldt to the
district rendezvous.He can depend upon his wife and children to care
for the flocks and herds; but if the impending danger appears to be
great, the cattle are deserted and the women and children are taken to a
rendezvous specially planned for such an emergency.If there is a need,
the Boer woman will stand side by side with her husband or her brother
or her sweetheart, and will allow no one to surpass her in repelling the
attacks of the enemy.Joan of Arcs have been as numerous in the Boer
armies as they have been unheralded.The head of the military branch of the Transvaal Government for many
years has been Commandant-General P. J. Joubert, who, following
President Kruger, is the ablest as well as the most popular Boer in
South Africa.General Joubert is the best type of the Boer fighter in
the country, and as he represents the army, he has always been a
favourite with the class which would rather decide a disputed point by
means of the rifle than by diplomacy, as practised by President Kruger.General Joubert, although the head of the army, is not of a quarrelsome
disposition, and he too believes in the peaceful arbitration of
differences rather than a resort to arms.By the Uitlanders he is
considered to be the most liberal Boer in the republic, and he has upon
numerous occasions shown that he would treat the newcomers in the
country with more leniency than the Kruger Government if he were in
power.In his capacity of Vice-President of the republic he has been as
impotent as the Vice-President is in the United States, but his
influence has always been wielded with a view of harmonizing the
differences of the native and alien populations.Twice the more liberal
and progressive party of the Boers has put him forward as a candidate
for the presidency in opposition to Mr.Kruger, and each time he has
been defeated by only a small majority.The younger Boers who have come
in touch with the more modern civilization have steadfastly supported
General Joubert, while the older Boers, who are ever fearful that any
one but Mr.Kruger would grant too many concessions to the Uitlanders,
have wielded their influence against him.Concerning the franchise for
Uitlanders, General Joubert is more liberal than President Kruger, who
holds that the stability of the Government depends upon the
exclusiveness of the franchise privilege.General Joubert believes that
there are many persons among the Uitlanders who have a real desire to
become citizens of the republic and to take part in the government.He
believes that an intending burgher should take an oath of fidelity, and
afterward be prepared to do what he can for the country, either in peace
or war.If after three or four years the applicant for the franchise
has shown that he worked in the interests of the country and obeyed its
laws, General Joubert believes that the Uitlander should enjoy all the
privileges that a native burgher enjoys--namely, voting for the
candidates for the presidency and the First Volksraad.General Joubert's name has been connected with Transvaal history almost
as long and as prominently as that of President Kruger.The two men are
virtually the fathers of the Boer republic.General Joubert has always
been the man who fought the battles with armies, while Mr.Kruger
conducted the diplomatic battles, and both were equally successful in
their parts.General Joubert, as a youth among the early trekkers from
Natal, was reared amid warfare.During the Transvaal's early battles
with the natives he was a volunteer soldier under the then
Commandant-General Kruger, and later, when the war of independence was
fought, he became General Joubert.He commanded the forces which fought
the battles of Laing's Nek, Bronkhorst Spruit, and Majuba Hill, and he
was one of the triumvirate that conducted the affairs of the Government
during that crucial time.He has been Vice-President of the republic
since the independence of the country has been re-established, and
conducted the affairs of the army during the time when Jameson's
troopers threatened the safety of the country.He has had a notable
career in the service of his country, and as a reward for his services
he is deserving of nothing less than the presidency of the republic
after Mr.Kruger's life-work is ended.General Joubert is no less distinguished as a diplomatist among his
countrymen than President Kruger, and many stories are current in
Pretoria showing that he has been able to accomplish many things wherein
Mr.An incident which occurred immediately after the
Jameson raid, and which is repeated here exactly as related by one of
the participants of the affair, is illustrative of General Joubert and
his methods of dealing with his own people.The story is given in
almost the exact language of the narrator who was the eyewitness:

"Shortly after Jameson and his officers were brought to Pretoria,
President Kruger called about twenty of the Boer commanders to his house
for a consultation.The townspeople were highly excited, and the
presence of the men who had tried to destroy the republic aggravated
their condition so that there were few calm minds in the capital.President Kruger was deeply affected by the seriousness of the events of
the days before, but counselled all those present to be calm.There
were some in the gathering who advised that Jameson and his men should
be shot immediately, while one man jocosely remarked that they should
not be treated so leniently, and suggested that a way to make them
suffer would be to cut off their ears."One of the men who was obliged to leave the meeting gave this account
to the waiting throngs in the street, and a few hours afterward the
cable had carried the news to Europe and America, with the result that
the Boers were called brutal and inhuman.President Kruger used all his
influence and eloquence to save the lives of the prisoners, and for a
long time he was unsuccessful in securing the smallest amount of
sympathy for Jameson and his men.It was dawn when General Joubert was
won to the President's way of thinking, and he continued the argument in
behalf of the prisoners."'My friends, I will ask you to listen patiently to me for several
minutes,' he commenced.'I will tell you the story of the farmer and
the neighbour's dog.Suppose that near your farm lives a man whose
valuable dogs attack your sheep and kill many.Will you shoot the dogs
as soon as you see them, and in that way make yourself liable for
damages greater than the value of the sheep that were destroyed?Or
will you catch the dogs when you are able to do so and, carrying them to
your neighbour, say to him: "I have caught your dogs; now pay me for the
damage they have done me, and they shall be returned to you."'"After a moment's silence General Joubert's face lighted up joyfully,
and he exclaimed:

"'We have the neighbour's dogs in the jail."The parable was effective, and the council of war decided almost
instantly to deliver the prisoners to the British Government."CHAPTER IX

                   CAUSES OF THE PRESENT DISSENSIONS


The politicians and the speculators have been the bane of South Africa.Ill-informed secretaries of the British Colonial Office might augment
the list, but their stupidity in treating with colonial grievances is so
proverbial as to admit them to the rank of natural or providential
causes of dissension.Until the Boer Government came into the
foreground, the politicians and speculators used South Africa as a huge
chessboard, whereon they could manipulate the political and commercial
affairs of hundreds of thousands of persons to suit their own fancies
and convenience.It was a dilettante politician who operated in South Africa and could
not make a cat's-paw of the colonial secretary in Downing Street, and it
was a stupid speculator who was unable to be the power behind the
enthroned politician.Hundreds of
men have gone to South Africa and have become millionaires, but
thousands remain in the country praying for money wherewith to return
home.The former are the politicians and the speculators; the latter
are the miners, the workingmen, and the tradespeople.It is a country where the man with a million becomes a multimillionaire,
and the man with hundreds becomes penniless.It is the wealthy man's
footstool and the poor man's cemetery.Men go there to acquire riches;
few go there to assist in making it tenable for white men.Thousands go
there with the avowed intention of making their fortunes and then to
return.Those who go there as came the immigrants to America--to settle
and develop the new country--can be counted only by the score.Of the
million white people south of the Zambezi, probably one half are mere
fortune-seekers, who would leave the country the very instant they
secured a moderate fortune.These have the welfare of the country at heart only in so far as it
interferes or assists them in attaining their desired goal.They would
ask that Portugal be allowed to rule all of South Africa if they
received the assurance that the much-sought-after fortune could be
secured six months sooner.They have no conscience other than that
which prevents them from stabbing a man to relieve him of his money.They go to the gold and diamond fields to secure wealth, and not to
assist in developing law and order, good government, or good
institutions.The other half of the white population is composed of men and women who
were born in the country--Afrikanders, Dutch, Boers, and other racial
representatives, and others who have emigrated thither from the densely
populated countries of Europe, with the intention of remaining in the
country and taking part in its government and institutions.These
classes comprise the South Africans, who love their country and take a
real interest in its development and progress.They know its needs and
prospects, and are abundantly able to conduct its government so that it
will benefit Boer, Englishman, Dutchman, Natalian, and native.The defects in the Government of Cape Colony and Natal are the natural
results of the handicaps that have been placed on the local legislation
by the Colonial Office in London, who are as ignorant of the real
conditions of their colonies as a Zulu chieftain is of the political
situation in England.The colonial papers teem with letters from
residents who express their indignation at the methods employed by the
Colonial Office in dealing with colonial affairs.Especially is this
the case in Natal, the Eden of South Africa, where the dealings of the
Colonial Office with regard to the Zulus have been stupidly carried on.South African men of affairs who are not bigoted do not hesitate to
express their opinion that Cape Colony and Natal have been retarded a
quarter of a century in their natural growth by the handicap of the
Colonial Office.Their opinion is based upon the fact that every war,
with the exception of several native outbreaks, has been caused by
blundering in the Colonial Office, and that all the wars have retarded
the natural growth and development of the colonies to an aggregate of
twenty-five years.In this estimate is not included the great harm to
industries that has been caused by the score or more of heavy war clouds
with which the country has been darkened during the last half century.These being some of the difficulties with which the two British colonies
in South Africa are beset, it can be readily inferred to what extent the
Boers of the Transvaal have had cause for grievance.In their dealings
with the Boers the British have invariably assumed the role of
aristocrats, and have looked upon and treated the "trekkers" as
_sans-culottes_.[Illustration: Cape Colony Government House, at Cape Town.]This natural antipathy of one race for another has given glorious
opportunities for strife, and neither one nor the other has ever failed
to take quick advantage.The struggle between the Boers and the British
began in Cape Colony almost one hundred years ago, and it has continued,
with varying degrees of bitterness, until the present day.The recent
disturbances in the Transvaal affairs date from the conclusion of the
war of independence in 1881.When the Peace Commissioners met there was
inserted in the treaty one small clause which gave to England her only
right to interfere in the political affairs of the Transvaal.The Boer country at that time was considered of such little worth that
Gladstone declared it was not of sufficient value to be honoured with a
place under the British flag.To the vast majority of the British
people it was a matter of indifference whether the Transvaal was an
independent country or a dependency of their own Government.The clause
which was allowed to enter the treaty unnoticed, and which during recent
years has figured so prominently in the discussions of South African
affairs, reads:

"The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with
any state or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any
native tribe to the eastward or the westward of the republic, until the
same has been approved by her Majesty the Queen.Such approval shall be
considered to have been granted if her Majesty's Government shall not,
within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be
delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that
the conclusion of the treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great
Britain, or of any of her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."When the contents of the treaty were published to the Boer people, many
of them objected strongly to this clause, and insisted that it gave the
British too great power in the affairs of the republic, and a strenuous
effort was made to have the offending clause eliminated.In the year
1883 a deputation, which included Paul Kruger, was sent to London, with
a view of obtaining the abolition of the suzerainty.This deputation
negotiated a new convention the following year, from which the word
"suzerainty" and the stipulations in regard thereto were removed.In
their report to the Volksraad, made in 1884, the deputation stated that
the new convention put an end to the British suzerainty.February 4, 1884, in a letter to Lord Derby, then in charge of British
affairs, the deputation announced to him that they expected an agreement
to be contained in the treaty relative to the abolition of the
suzerainty.In his reply of a week later, Lord Derby made a statement
upon which the Boers base their strongest claim that the suzerainty was
abolished.He said:

"By the omission of those articles of the convention of Pretoria which
assigned to her Majesty and to the British resident certain specific
powers and functions connected with the internal government and the
foreign relations of the Transvaal state, your Government will be left
free to govern the country without interference, and to conduct its
diplomatic intercourse and shape its foreign policy, subject only to the
requirement embodied in the fourth article of the new draft, that any
treaty with a foreign state shall not have effect without the approval
of the Queen."For a period of almost ten years the suzerainty of England over the
Transvaal was an unknown quantity.With the exception of several
Government officials, there were hardly any Englishmen in the country,
and no one had the slightest interest in the affairs of the Transvaal
Government.When gold was discovered in the Randt in quantities that
equalled those of the early days of the California gold fields, an
unparalleled influx of Englishmen and foreigners followed, and in
several years the city of Johannesburg had sprung up in the veldt.The opening of hundreds of mines, and the consequent increase in
expenditures, made it necessary for the Transvaal Government to increase
its revenues.Mining laws had to be formulated, new offices had to be
created, hundreds of new officials had to be appointed, and all this
required the expenditure of more money in one year than the Government
had spent in a decade before the opening of the mines.The Government
found itself in a quandary, and it solved the problem of finances as
many a stronger and wealthier government has done.Concessions were granted to dynamite, railway, electric light, electric
railway, water, and many other companies, and these furnished to the
Government the nucleus upon which depended its financial existence.Few
of the concessions were obtained by British subjects, and when the
monopolies took advantage of their opportunities, and raised the price
of dynamite and the rates for carrying freight, the Englishmen, who
owned all the mines, naturally objected.The Boer Government, having
bound itself hand and foot when hard pressed for money, was unable to
compel the concessionaries to reduce their rates.At that period of the Randt's existence the speculators appeared, and
soon thereafter the London Stock Exchange became a factor in the affairs
of the Randt.Where the Stock Exchange leads, the politicians follow,
and they too soon became interested in South African affairs.Then the
treaty of 1883 was found in the Colonial Office archives, and next
appears a demand to the Boer Government that all British residents of
the Transvaal be allowed to vote.The Boers refused to give the
franchise to any applicant unless he first renounced his allegiance to
other countries, and, as the British subjects declined to accede to the
request, the politicians became busily engaged in formulating other
plans whereby England might obtain control of the country.At that inopportune time Jameson's troopers entered the Transvaal
territory and attempted to take forcible possession of the country; but
they were unsuccessful, and only succeeded in directing the world's
sympathy to the Boers.The Jameson raid was practically Cecil J.
Rhodes's first important attempt to add the Transvaal to the list of
South African additions he has made to the British Empire.The result
was especially galling to him, as it was the first time his great
political schemes failed of success.But Rhodes is not the man to weep over disasters.Before the excitement
over the raid had subsided, Rhodes had concocted a plan to inflict a
commercial death upon the Transvaal, and in that manner force it to beg
for the protection of the English flag.He opened Rhodesia, an
adjoining country, for settlement, and by glorifying the country, its
mineral and agricultural wealth, and by offering golden inducements to
Transvaal tradespeople, miners, and even Transvaal subjects, he hoped to
cause such an efflux from the Transvaal that the Government would be
embarrassed in less than two years.The country which bears his name
was found to be amazingly free from mountains of gold and rivers of
honey, and the several thousand persons who had faith in his alluring
promises remained in Rhodesia less than a year, and then returned to the
Transvaal.The reports of the Rhodesian country that were brought back by the
disappointed miners and settlers were not flattering to the condition of
the country or the justice of the Government.Of two evils, they chose
the lesser, and again placed themselves under the Kruger Government.When revolution and enticement failed to bring the Transvaal under the
British flag, Rhodes inaugurated a political propaganda.His last
resort was the Colonial Office in London, and in that alone lay the only
course by which he could attain his object.Again the franchise question was resorted to as the ground of the
contention, the dynamite and railway subjects having been so thoroughly
debated as to be as void of ground for further contention as they had
always been foreign to British control or interference.The question of
granting the right of voting to the Uitlanders in the Transvaal is one
which so vitally affects the future life of the Government that the
Boers' concession of that right would be tantamount to presenting the
country to the British Government.of the Uitlanders of the Transvaal are no more
than transient citizens.They were attracted thither by the gold mines
and the attendant industries, and they have no thought of staying in the
Transvaal a minute after they have amassed a fortune or a competency.Under no consideration would they remain in the country for the rest of
their lives, because the climate and nature of the country are not
conducive to a desire for long residence.It has been demonstrated that
less than one per cent.of the Uitlanders had sufficient interest in the
country to pass through the formality of securing naturalization papers
preparatory to becoming eligible for the franchise.The Boer Government has offered that all Uitlanders of nine years'
residence, having certain unimportant qualifications, should be
enfranchised in two years, and that others should be enfranchised in
seven years--two years for naturalization and five more years'
resident--before acquiring the right to vote.There is a provision for a property qualification, which makes it
necessary for the naturalized citizen to own a house of no less value
than two hundred and fifty dollars in renting value, or an income of one
thousand dollars.The residence clause in the Transvaal qualifications
compares favourably with those of London, where an Englishman from any
part of the country and settling in the municipality is obliged to live
two years and have certain property qualifications before acquiring the
right of franchise.In full knowledge of these conditions the Uitlanders insist upon having
an unconditional franchise--one that will require nothing more than a
two-years' residence in the country.The Boers are well aware of the
results that would follow the granting of the concessions demanded, but
not better so than the Uitlanders who make the demands.The latest
Transvaal statistics place the number of Boer burghers in the country at
less than thirty thousand.At the lowest estimate there are in the
Transvaal fifty thousand Uitlanders having the required qualifications,
and all of these would become voters in two years.At the first
election held after the two years had elapsed the Uitlanders would be
victorious, and those whom they elected would control the machinery of
the Government.The Uitlanders' plan is as transparent as air, yet it
has the approval and sanction of the English politicians, press, and
public.The propaganda which Rhodes and other politicians and stock brokers
interested in the Transvaal gold mines inaugurated a short time after
the Jameson raid has been successful in arousing the people in England
to what they have been led to believe is a situation unequalled in the
history of the empire-building.At the
same time the British Parliament was discussing the subject of the
alleged injustice under which the English residents of the Transvaal
were suffering, the colonial secretary was engaged in disposing of
grievances which reached him from the Dutch residents of British Guiana,
in South America, and which recited conditions parallel to those
complained of by the Uitlanders.The grievances were made by foreign
residents of English territory, instead of by English subjects in a
foreign country, and consequently demanded less serious attention, but
their justice was none the less patent.The three thousand native Dutch
voters in British Guiana have no voice in the legislative or
administrative branches of the colonial government, owing to the
peculiar laws which give to the three thousand British-born citizens the
complete control of the franchise.The population of the colony is
three hundred thousand, yet the three thousand British subjects make and
administer the laws for the other two hundred and ninety-seven thousand
inhabitants, who compose the mining and agricultural communities and are
treated with the same British contempt as the Boers.The Dutch
residents have made many appeals for a fuller representation in the
Government, but no reforms have been inaugurated or promised.The few grievances which the Uitlanders had before the Jameson raid have
been multiplied a hundredfold and no epithet is too venomous for them to
apply to the Boers.The letters in the home newspapers have allied the
name of the Boers with every vilifying adjective in the English
dictionary, and returning politicians have never failed to supply the
others that do not appear in the book.Petitions with thousands of names, some real, but many non-existent,
have been forwarded to the Colonial Office and to every other office in
London where they would be received, and these have recited grievances
that even the patient Boer Volksraad had never heard about.It has been
a propaganda of petitions and letters the like of which has no parallel
in the history of politics.It has been successful in arousing
sentiment favourable to the Uitlanders, and at this time there is hardly
a handful of persons in England who are not willing to testify to the
utter degradation of the Boers.Another branch of the propaganda operated through the Stock Exchange,
and its results were probably more practical than those of the literary
branch.It is easier to reach the English masses through the Stock
Exchange than by any other means.Whenever one of the "Kaffir" or
Transvaal companies failed to make both ends meet in a manner which
pleased the stockholders, it was only necessary to blame the Boer
Government for having impeded the digging of gold, and the stockholders
promptly outlined to the Colonial Office the policy it should pursue
toward the Boers.The impressions that are formed in watching the tide of events in the
Transvaal are that the Boer Government is not greatly inferior to the
Government of Lord Salisbury and Secretary Chamberlain.The only
appreciable difference between the two is that the Boers are fighting
the cause of the masses against the classes, while the English are
fighting that of the classes against the masses.In England, where the
rich have the power, the poor pay the taxes, while in the Transvaal the
poor have the power and compel the rich to pay the taxes.If the
Transvaal taxes were of such serious proportions as to be almost
unbearable, there might be a cause for interference by the Uitlander
capitalists who own the mines, but there no injustice is shown to any
one.The only taxes that the Uitlanders are compelled to pay are the
annual poll tax of less than four dollars and a half, mining taxes of a
dollar and a quarter a month for each claim for prospecting licenses,
and five dollars a claim for diggers' licenses.Boer and Uitlander are
compelled to pay these taxes without distinction.The Boers, in this contention, must win or die.In earlier days, before
every inch of African soil was under the flag of one country or another,
they were able to escape from English injustice by loading their few
possessions on wagons and "trekking" into new and unexplored lands.If
they yield their country to the English without a struggle, they will be
forced to live under a future Stock Exchange Government, which has been
described by a member of the British Parliament as likely to be "the
vilest, the most corrupt, and the most pernicious known to man."[#]


[#] The Hon.Henry Labouchere, in London Truth.The Boers have no better argument to advance in support of their claim
than that which is contained in the Transvaal national hymn.It at once
gives a history of their country, its many struggles and
disappointments, and its hopes.It is written in the "taal" of the
country, and when sung by the patriotic, deep-voiced Boers is one of the
most impressive hymns that ever inspired a nation.The four-colours of our dear old land
      Again float o'er Transvaal,
    And woe the God-forgetting hand
      That down our flag would haul!Wave higher now in clearer sky
      Our Transvaal freedom's stay!Our enemies with fright did fly;
      Now dawns a glorious day.Through many a storm ye bravely stood,
      And we stood likewise true;
    Now, that the storm is o'er, we would
      Leave nevermore from you
    Bestormed by Kaffir, Lion, Brit,
      Wave ever o'er their head;
    And then to spite we hoist thee yet
      Up to the topmost stead!Four long years did we beg--aye, pray--
      To keep our lands clear, free,
    We asked you, Brit, we loath the fray:
      "Go hence, and let us be!We've waited, Brit, we love you not,
      To arms we call the Boer;"
        (Lit., Now take we to our guns.)"You've teased us long enough, we troth,
      Now wait we nevermore."And with God's help we cast the yoke
      Of England from our knee;
    Our country safe--behold and look--
      Once more our flag waves free!Though many a hero's blood it cost,
      May all the nations see
        (Lit., Though England ever so much more.)That God the Lord redeemed our hosts;
      The glory his shall be.Wave high now o'er our dear old land,
      Wave four-colours of Transvaal!And woe the God-forgetting hand
      That dares you down to haul!Wave higher now in clearer sky
      Our Transvaal freedom's stay!Our enemies with fright did fly;
      Now dawns a glorious day.CHAPTER X

                        PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE


Ever since the Jameson raid both the Boers and the Uitlanders have
realized that a peaceful solution of the differences between the two is
possible but highly improbable.The Uitlanders refused to concede
anything to the Boer, and asked for concessions that implied a virtual
abandonment of their country to the English, whom they have always
detested.The Boers themselves have not been unmindful of the
inevitable war with their powerful antagonist, and, not unlike the tiny
ant of the African desert, which fortifies its abode against the
anticipated attack of wild beasts, have made of their country a
veritable arsenal.Probably no inland country in the world is half so well prepared for war
at any time as that little Government, which can boast of having less
than thirty thousand voters.The military preparation has been so
enormous that Great Britain has been compelled, according to the
colonial secretary's statement to the British Parliament, to expend two
and a half million dollars annually in South Africa in order to keep
pace with the Boers.Four years ago, when the Transvaal Government
learned that the Uitlanders of Johannesburg were planning a revolution,
it commenced the military preparations which have ever since continued
with unabating vigour.German experts were employed to formulate plans
for the defence of the country, and European artillerists were secured
to teach the arts of modern warfare to the men at the head of the Boer
army.Several Americans of military training became the instructors in
the national military school at Pretoria; and even the women and
children became imbued with the necessity of warlike preparation, and
learned the use of arms.Several million pounds were annually spent in
Europe in the purchase of the armament required by the plans formulated
by the experts, and the whole country was placed on a war footing.Every important strategic position was made as impregnable as modern
skill and arms could make it, and every farmer's cottage was supplied
with arms and ammunition, so that the volunteer army might be mobilized
in a day.In order to demonstrate the extent to which the military preparation has
been carried, it is only necessary to give an account of the defences of
Pretoria and Johannesburg, the two principal cities of the country.Pretoria, being the capital, and naturally the chief point of attack by
the enemy, has been prepared to resist the onslaught of any number of
men, and is in a condition to withstand a siege of three years.The
city lies in the centre of a square, at each corner of which is a lofty
hill surmounted by a strong fort, which commands the valleys and the
surrounding country.Each of the four forts has four heavy cannon, four
French guns of fifteen miles range, and thirty heavy Gatling guns.Besides this extraordinary protection, the city has fifty light Gatling
guns which can be drawn by mules to any point on the hills where an
attack may be made.Three large warehouses are filled with ammunition,
and the large armory is packed to the eaves with Mauser, Martini-Henry,
and Wesley-Richards rifles.Two extensive refrigerators, with a
capacity of two thousand oxen each, are ample provision against a siege
of many months.It is difficult to compute the total expenditures for
war material by the Boer Government during the last four years, but the
following official announcement of expenses for one year will serve to
give an idea of the vastness of the preparations that the Government has
been compelled to make in order to guard the safety of the country:

    War-Office salaries .$262,310
    War purposes.4,717,550
    Johannesburg revolt .800,000
    Public works.3,650,000
                                           ----------
                                           $9,429,860


Johannesburg has extensive fortifications around it, but the Boers will
use them for other purposes than those of self-protection.The forts at
the Golden City were erected for the purpose of quelling any revolution
of the Uitlanders, who constitute almost entirely the population of the
city.One of the forts is situated on a small eminence about half a mile north
of the business part, and commands the entire city with its guns.Two
years were consumed in building the fortification and in placing the
armament in position.Its guns can rake not only every street of the
city, but ten of the principal mine works as well, and the damage that
their fire could cause is incalculable.Another fort, almost as strong
as the one in Johannesburg, is situated a mile east of the city, and
overshadows the railway and the principal highway to Johannesburg.The
residents of the city are greatly in fear of underground works, which
they have been led to believe were constructed since the raid.Vast
quantities of earth were taken out of the Johannesburg fort, and for
such a length of time did the work continue that the Uitlanders decided
that the Boers were undermining the city, and protested to the
Government against such a course.As soon as war is declared and the
women and children have been removed from the city, Johannesburg will be
rent with shot and shell.The Boers have announced their intention of
doing this, and the Uitlanders, anticipating it, seek safety in flight
whenever there are rumours of war, as thousands did immediately before
and after the Jameson affair.The approaches to the mountain passes on the border have been fortified
with vast quantities of German and French ordnance, and equipped with
garrisons of men born or trained in Europe.The approaches to Laing's
Nek, near the Natal border, which have several times been the battle
ground of the English and Boer forces, have been prepared to resist an
invading army from Natal.Much attention has been directed to the
preparations in that part of the republic, because the British
commanders will find it easier to transfer forces from the port of
Durban, which is three hundred and six miles from the Transvaal border,
while Cape Town is almost a thousand miles distant.But the Pretorian Government has made many provisions for war other than
those enumerated.It has made alliances and friends that will be of
equal worth in the event of an attack by England.The Orange Free
State, whose existence is as gravely imperilled as that of the
Transvaal, will fight hand-in-hand with its neighbour, just as it was
prepared to do at the time of the Jameson raid, when almost every Free
State burgher lay armed on the south bank of the Vaal River, awaiting
the summons for assistance from the Kruger Government.In the event of
war the two Governments will be as one, and, in anticipation of the
struggle of the Boers against the British, the Free State Government has
been expending vast sums of money every year in strengthening the
country's defences.At the same time that the Free State is being
prepared for war, its Government officials are striving hard to prevent
a conflict, and are attempting to conciliate the two principals in the
strife by suggesting that concessions be made by both.The Free State
is not so populous as the Transvaal, and consequently can not place as
many men in the field, but the ten thousand burghers who will answer the
call to arms will be an acceptable addition to the Boer forces.The element of doubt enters into the question of what the Boers and
their co-religionists of Cape Colony and Natal will do in the event of
war.The Dutch of Cape Colony are the majority of the population, and,
although loyal British subjects under ordinary circumstances, are
opposed to English interference in the Transvaal's affairs.Those of
Natal, while not so great in numbers, are equally friendly with the
Transvaal Boers, and would undoubtedly recall some of their old
grievances against the British Government as sufficient reason to join
the Boers in war.In Cape Colony there is an organization called the Afrikander Bond which
recently has gained control of the politics of the colony, and which
will undoubtedly be supreme for many years to come.The motto of the
organization is "South Africa for South Africans," and its doctrine is
that South Africa shall be served first and Great Britain afterward.Its members, who are chiefly Dutch, believe their first duty is to
assist the development of the resources of their own country by proper
protective tariffs and stringent legislation in native affairs, and they
regard legislation with a view to British interests as of secondary
importance.The Bond has been very amicably inclined toward its
Afrikander kinsmen in the Transvaal, especially since the Jameson raid,
and every sign of impending trouble between England and the Boers widens
the chasm between the English and Afrikanders of South Africa.The
Dutch approve of President Kruger's course in dealing with the franchise
problems, and if hostilities break out it would be not the least
incompatible with their natures to assist their Transvaal and Free State
kinsmen even at the risk of plunging the whole of South Africa into a
civil war.W. P. Schreiner, the Premier of Cape Colony, is the leading
member of the Bond, and with him he has associated the majority of the
leading men in the colony.Under ordinary conditions their loyalty to
Great Britain is undoubted, but whether they could resist the influence
of their friends in the Bond if it should decide to cast its fortunes
with the Boers in case of war is another matter.Of such vast importance is the continued loyalty of the Dutch of the two
colonies that upon it depends practically the future control of the Cape
by the British Government.Being in the majority as three to two, and
almost in supreme control of the local government, the Dutch of Cape
Colony are in an excellent position to secede from the empire, as they
have already threatened to do, in which event England would be obliged
to fight almost the united population of the whites if she desired to
retain control of the country.With this in mind, it is no wonder that
Mr.Chamberlain declared that England had reached a critical turning
point in the history of the empire.The uncertainty of the situation is increased by the doubtful stand
which the native races are taking in the dispute.Neither England nor
the Boers has the positive assurance of support from any of the tribes,
which outnumber the whites as ten to one; but it will not be an
unwarranted opinion to place the majority of the native tribes on the
side of the Boers.The native races are always eager to be the friends
of the paramount power, and England's many defeats in South Africa
during recent years have not assisted in gaining for it that prestige.When England enters upon a war with the Transvaal the natives will
probably follow the example of the Matabele natives, who rebelled
against the English immediately after Jameson and his men were defeated
by the Boers, because they believed a conquered nation could offer no
resistance.The Boers, having won the last battle, are considered by the
natives to be the paramount power, and it is always an easy matter to
induce a subjected people to ally itself with a supposedly powerful one.The Zulus, still stinging under the defeat which they received from the
British less than twenty years ago, might gather their war parties and,
with the thousands of guns they have been allowed to buy, attempt to
secure revenge.The Basutos, east of the Orange Free State, now the
most powerful and the only undefeated nation in the country, would
hardly allow a war to be fought unless they participated in it, even if
only to demonstrate to the white man that they still retain their
old-time courage and ability.The million and a half natives in Cape
Colony, and the equal number in the Transvaal, have complained of so
many alleged grievances at the hands of their respective governments
that they might be presumed to rise against them, though it is never
possible to determine the trend of the African <DW64>'s mind.What the
various tribes would do in such an emergency can be answered only by the
chiefs themselves, and they will not speak until the time for action is
at hand.Perhaps when that time does arrive there may be a realization
of the natives' dream--that a great leader will come from the north who
will organize all the various tribes into one grand army and with it
drive the hated white men into the sea.It is impossible to secure accurate statistics in regard to the military
strength of the various colonies, states, and tribes in the country, but
the following table gives a fair idea of the number of men who are
liable to military duty:

                              Dutch.Cape Colony               20,000        10,000        177,000
    Natal                      7,000         5,000        100,000
    Orange Free State         10,000       ......         30,000
    Transvaal                 30,000        20,000        140,000
    Rhodesia                 ......         2,000         25,000
    Swaziland and Basutoland ......       ......         30,000
                              ------        ------        -------
    Total                     67,000        37,000        570,000


To him who delights in forming possible coalitions and war situations
this table offers vast opportunities.Probably no other country can
offer such a vast number of possibilities for compacts between nations,
races, and tribes as is presented in South Africa.There all the
natives may unite against the whites, or a part of them against a part
of the whites, while whites and natives may unite against a similar
combination.The possibilities are boundless; the probabilities are
uncertain.The Pretorian Government has had an extensive secret service for several
years, and this has been of inestimable value in securing the support of
the natives as well as the friendship of many whites, both in South
Africa and abroad.The several thousand Irishmen in South Africa have
been organized into a secret compact, and have been and will continue to
be of great value to the Boers.The head of the organization is a man
who is one of President Kruger's best friends, and his lieutenants are
working even as far away as America.The sympathy of the majority of
the Americans in the Transvaal is with the Boer cause, and, although the
American consul-general at Cape Town has cautioned them to remain
neutral, they will not stand idly by and watch the defeat of a cause
which they believe to be as just as that for which their forefathers
fought at Bunker Hill and Lexington.But the Boers do not rely upon external assistance to win their battles
for them.When it becomes necessary to defend their liberty and their
country they reverently place their trust in Providence and their
rifles.Their forefathers' battles were won with such confidence, and
the later generations have been similarly successful under like
conditions.The rifle is the young Boer's primer and the grandfather's
testament.It is the Boers' avenger of wrong and the upholder of right.That their confidence in their rifles has not been misapplied has been
demonstrated at Laing's Nek, Majuba Hill, Doornkop, and in battles with
natives.The natural opportunities provided by Nature which in former years were
responsible for the confidence which the Boers reposed in their rifles
may have disappeared with the approach of advancing civilization, but
the Boer of to-day is as dangerous an adversary with a gun as his father
was in the wars with the Zulus and the Matabeles half a century ago.The
buck, rhinoceros, elephant, and hippopotamus are not as numerous now as
then, but the Boer has devised other means by which he may perfect
himself in marksmanship.Shooting is one of the main diversions of the
Boer, and prizes are offered for the best results in contests.It is
customary to mark out a ring, about two hundred and fifty feet in
diameter, in the centre of which a small stuffed figure resembling a
bird is attached to a pole.The marksmen stand on the outside of the
circle and fire in turn at the target.A more curious target, and one
that taxes the ability of the marksman, is in more general use
throughout the country.A hole sufficiently deep to retain a
turkey-cock is dug in a level plot of ground, and over this is placed a
piece of canvas which contains a small hole through which the bird can
extend and withdraw its head.At a distance of three hundred feet the
bird's head is a target by no means easily hit.Military men are accustomed to sneer at the lack of generalship of the
Boer forces, but in only one of the battles in which they have engaged
the British forces have the trained military men and leaders been able
to cope with them.In the battle of Boomplaats, fought in 1848, the
English officers can claim their only victory over the Boers, who were
armed with flintlocks, while the British forces had heavy artillery.In
almost all the encounters that have taken place the Boer forces were not
as large as those of the enemy, yet the records show that many more
casualties were inflicted than received by them.In the chief
engagements the appended statistics show that the Boers had only a small
percentage of their men in the casualty list, while the British losses
were much greater.Laing's Nek           400        550          190         24
    Ingogo                300        250          142         17
    Majuba Hill           600        150          280          5
    Bronkhorst            250        300          120          1
    Jameson raid          600        400          100          5


It is hardly fair to assume that the Boers' advantages in these battles
were gained without the assistance of capable generals when it is taken
into consideration that there is a military axiom which places the value
of an army relatively with the ability of its commanders.The Boers may
exaggerate when they assert that one of their soldiers is the equal in
fighting ability of five British soldiers, but the results of the
various battles show that they have some slight foundation for their
theory.The regular British force in South Africa is comparatively small, but it
would require less than a month to transport one hundred thousand
trained soldiers from India and England and place them on the scene of
action.Several regiments of trained soldiers are always stationed in
different parts of the country near the Transvaal border, and at brief
notice they could be placed on Boer territory.Charlestown, Ladysmith,
and Pietermaritzburg, in Natal, have been British military headquarters
for many years, and during the last three years they have been
strengthened by the addition of several regular regiments.The British
Colonial Office has been making preparations for several years for a
conflict.Every point in the country has been strengthened, and all the
foreign powers whose interests in the country might lead them to
interfere in behalf of the Boers have been placated.Germany has been
taken from the British zone of danger by favourable treaties; France is
fearful to try interference alone; and Portugal, the only other nation
interested, is too weak and too deeply in England's debt to raise her
voice against anything that may be done.By leasing the town of Lorenzo Marques from the Portuguese Government,
Great Britain has acquired one of the best strategic points in South
Africa.The lease, the terms of which are unannounced, was the
culmination of much diplomatic dickering, in which the interests of
Germany and the South African Republic were arrayed against those of
England and Portugal.There is no doubt that England made the lease
only in order to gain an advantage over President Kruger, and to prevent
him from further fortifying his country with munitions of war imported
by way of Lorenzo Marques and Delagoa Bay.England gains a commercial
advantage too, but it is hardly likely that she would care to add the
worst fever-hole in Africa to her territory simply to please the few of
her merchants who have business interests in the town.Since the Jameson
raid the Boers have been purchasing vast quantities of guns and
ammunition in Europe for the purpose of preparing themselves for any
similar emergency.Delagoa Bay alone was an open port to the Transvaal,
every other port in South Africa being under English dominion and
consequently closed to the importation of war material.Lorenzo
Marques, the natural port of the Transvaal, is only a short distance
from the eastern border of that country, and is connected with Pretoria
and Johannesburg by a railway.It was over this railway that the Boers
were able to carry the guns and ammunition with which to fortify their
country, and England could not raise a finger to prevent the little
republic from doing as it pleased.Hardly a month has passed since the
raid that the Transvaal authorities did not receive a large consignment
of guns and powder from Germany and France by way of Lorenzo Marques.England could do nothing more than have several detectives at the docks
to take an inventory of the munitions as they passed in transit.The transfer of Lorenzo Marques to the British will put an effectual bar
to any further importation of guns into the Transvaal, and will
practically prevent any foreign assistance from reaching the Boers in
the event of another war.Both Germany and England tried for many years
to induce Portugal to sell Delagoa Bay, but being the debtor of both to
a great extent, the sale could not be made to one without arousing the
enmity of the other.Eighteen or twenty years ago Portugal would have
sold her sovereign right over the port to Mr.Gladstone's Government for
sixty thousand dollars, but that was before Delagoa Bay had any
commercial or political importance.Since then Germany became the
political champion of the Transvaal, and blocked all the schemes of
England to isolate the inland country by cutting off its only neutral
connection with the sea.Recently, however, Germany has been
disappointed by the Transvaal Republic, and one of the results is the
present cordial relations between the Teutons and the Anglo-Saxons in
South African affairs.The English press and people in South Africa have always asserted that
by isolating the Transvaal from the sea the Boers could be starved into
submission in case of a war.As soon as the lease becomes effective, Mr.Kruger's country will be completely surrounded by English territory, at
least in such a way that nothing can be taken into the Transvaal without
first passing through an English port, and no foreign power will be able
to send forces to the aid of the Boers unless they are first landed on
British soil.It is doubtful whether any nation would incur such a
grave responsibility for the sake of securing Boer favour.Both the Transvaal and England are fully prepared for war, and diplomacy
only can postpone its coming.The Uitlanders' present demands may be
conceded, but others that will follow may not fare so well.A coveted
country will always be the object of attacks by a stronger power, and
the aggressor generally succeeds in securing from the weaker victim
whatever he desires.Whether British soldiers will be obliged to fight
the Boers alone in order to gratify the wishes of their Government, or
whether the enemy will be almost the entire white and black population
of South Africa, will not be definitely known until the British troop
ships start for Cape Town and Durban.[Illustration: Cape Town and Table Mountain.]Whichever enemy it will be, the British Government will attack, and will
pursue in no half-hearted or half-prepared manner, as it has done in
previous campaigns in the country.The Boers will be able to resist and
to prolong the campaign to perhaps eight months or a year, but they will
finally be obliterated from among the nations of the earth.It will
cost the British Empire much treasure and many lives, but it will
satisfy those who caused it--the politicians and speculators.CHAPTER XI

                   AMERICAN INTERESTS IN SOUTH AFRICA


An idea of the nature and extent of American enterprise in South Africa
might be deduced from the one example of a Boston book agent, who made a
competency by selling albums of United States scenery to the <DW64>s
along the shores of the Umkomaas River, near Zululand.The book agent
is not an incongruity of the activity of Americans in that part of the
continent, but an example rather of the diversified nature of the
influences which owe their origin to the nation of Yankees ten thousand
miles distant.The United States of America have had a deeper influence
upon South Africa than that which pertains to commerce and trade.The
progress, growth, and prosperity of the American States have instilled
in the minds of the majority of South Africans a desire to be free from
European control, and to be united under a single banner, which is to
bear the insignia of the United States of South Africa.In public, editors and speechmakers in Cape Colony, Natal, and the
Transvaal spend hours in deploring the progress of Americanisms in South
Africa, but in their clubs and libraries they study and discuss the
causes which led to America's progress and pre-eminence, and form plans
by which they may be able to attain the same desirable ends.The
influence and example of the United States are not theoretical; they are
political factors which are felt in the discussion of every public
question and in the results of every election.The practical results of
American influence in South Africa may now be observed only in the
increasing exports to that country, but perhaps in another generation a
greater and better demonstration will be found in a constitution which
unites all the South African states under one independent government.If any corroboration of this sentiment were necessary, a statement made
by the man who is leader of the ruling party in Cape Colony would be
ample."If we want an example of the highest type of freedom," said W. P.
Schreiner, the present Premier of Cape Colony, "we must look to the
United States of America."[#]


[#] Americans' Fourth of July Banquet, Cape Town, 1897.American influences are felt in all phases of South African life, be
they social, commercial, religious, political, or retrogressive.Whether it be the American book agent on the banks of the Umkomaas, or
the American consul-general in the governor's mansion at Cape Town, his
indomitable energy, his breezy indifference to apparently insurmountable
difficulties, and his boundless resources will always secure for him
those material benefits for which men of other nationalities can do no
more than hope.Some of his rivals call it perverseness, callousness,
trickery, treachery, and what not; his admirers might ascribe his
success to energy, pluck, modern methods, or to that quality best
described by that Americanism--"hustling."American commercial interests in South Africa are of such recent growth,
and already of such great proportions, that the other nations who have
been interested in the trade for many years are not only astounded, but
are fearful that the United States will soon be the controlling spirit
in the country's commercial affairs.The enterprise of American
business firms, and their ability to undersell almost all the other
firms represented in the country, have given an enormous impetus to the
export trade with South African countries.Systematic efforts have been
made by American firms to work the South African markets on an extensive
scale, and so successful have the efforts been that the value of exports
to that country has several times been more than doubled in a single
year.Five years ago America's share of the business of South Africa was
practically infinitesimal; to-day the United States hold second place in
the list of nations which have trade relations with that country, having
outranked Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, and Italy.In several
branches of trade America surpasses even England, which has always had
all the trade advantages owing to the supremacy of her flag over the
greater part of the country.That the British merchants are keenly alive
to the situation which threatens to transfer the trade supremacy into
American hands has been amply demonstrated by the efforts which they
have made to check the inroads the Americans are making on their field,
and by the appointment of committees to investigate the causes of the
decline of British commerce.American enterprise shows itself by the scores of representatives of
American business houses who are constantly travelling through the
country, either to secure orders or to investigate the field with a view
of entering into competition with the firms of other nations.Fifteen
American commercial travellers, representing as many different firms,
were registered at the Grand Hotel, Cape Town, at one time a year ago,
and that all had secured exceptionally heavy orders indicated that the
innovation in the method of working trade was successful.The laws of the country are unfavourable in no slight degree to the
foreign commercial travellers, who are obliged to pay heavy licenses
before they are permitted to enter upon any business negotiations.The
tax in the Transvaal and Natal is $48.66, and in the Orange Free State
and Cape Colony it amounts to $121.66.If an American agent wishes to
make a tour of all the states and colonies of the country, he is obliged
to pay almost three hundred and fifty dollars in license fees.The great superiority of certain American manufactured products is such
that other nations are unable to compete in those lines after the
American products have been introduced.Especially is this true of
American machinery, which can not be equalled by that of any other
country.Almost every one of the hundreds of extensive gold mines on
the Randt is fitted out wholly or in part with American machinery, and,
at the present rate of increase in the use of it, it will be less than
ten years when none other than United States machinery will be sent to
that district.In visiting the great mines the uninitiated American is
astonished to find that engines, crushing machinery, and even the
electric lights which illuminate them, bear the name plates of New York,
Philadelphia, and Chicago firms.The Kimberley diamond mines, which are among the most extensive and most
elaborate underground works in the world, use American-made machinery
almost exclusively, not only because it is much less costly, but because
no other country can furnish apparatus that will give as good results.Almost every pound of electrical machinery in use in the country was
made in America and was instituted by American workmen.Instances of successful American electrical enterprises are afforded by
the Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and Pretoria street railways, almost
every rail, wire, and car of which bears the marks of American
manufacture.It is a marvellous revelation to find Philadelphia-made
electric cars in the streets of Cape Town, condensing engines from New
York State in Port Elizabeth, and Pittsburg generators and switchboards
in the capital of the Transvaal, which less than fifty years ago was
under the dominion of savages.Not only did Americans install the
street railways, but they also secured the desirable concessions for
operating the lines for a stated period.American electricians operate
the plants, and in not a few instances have financially embarrassed
Americans received a new financial impetus by acting in the capacities
of motormen and conductors.One street car in Cape Town was for a long time distinguished because of
its many American features.The Philadelphia-made car was propelled
over Pittsburg tracks by means of the power passing through Wilkesbarre
wires, and the human agencies that controlled it were a Boston motorman
and a San Francisco conductor.It might not be pursuing the subject too
far to add that of the twelve passengers in the car on a certain journey
ten were Americans, representing eight different States.One of the first railroads in South Africa--that which leads from
Lorenzo Marques to the Transvaal border--was built by an American, a Mr.Murdock, while American material entered largely into the construction
of the more extensive roads from the coast to the interior.American
rails are more quickly and more cheaply[#] obtainable in South Africa
than those of English make, but the influence which is exerted against
the use of other than British rails prevents their universal adoption.Notwithstanding the efforts of the influential Englishmen to secure
British manufactures wherever and whenever possible, American firms have
recently secured the contracts for forty thousand tons of steel rails
for the Cape Colony Railway system, and the prospects are that more
orders of a similar nature will be forthcoming.[#] "But the other day we gave an order for two hundred and fifty miles
of rails.We had a large number of tenders, and the lowest tender, you
may be sorry to hear, was sent by an American, Mr.Fortunately, however, the tender was not in order, and we were therefore
able to give the work to our own people.It may be said that this
American tender was a question of workmen and strikes."--Cecil J.
Rhodes, at a meeting of the stockholders of the Cape-Cairo Railway,
London, May 2, 1899.It is not in the sale of steel rails alone that the American
manufacturer is forging ahead of his competitors in South Africa.American manufactured wares of all kinds are in demand, and in many
instances they are leaders in the market.Especially true is this of
American agricultural implements, which are so much more adaptable to
the soil and much cheaper than any other make.Small stores in the
farming communities of Natal and Cape Colony sell American ploughshares,
spades, forks, rakes, and hoes almost exclusively, and it amazes the
traveller to find that almost every plough and reaper used by the more
progressive agriculturists bears the imprint "Made in the United
States."It is a strange fact that, although South Africa has vast areas covered
with heavy timber, almost all the lumber used in the mining districts is
transported thither from Puget Sound.The native timber being unsuited
for underground purposes and difficult of access, all the mine owners
are obliged to import every foot of wood used in constructing surface
and underground works of their mines, and at great expense, for to the
original cost of the timber is added the charges arising from the sea
and land transportation, import duties, and handling.The docks at Cape
Town almost all the year round contain one or more lumber vessels from
Puget Sound, and upon several occasions five such vessels were being
unloaded at the same time.American coal, too, has secured a foothold in South Africa, a sample
cargo of three thousand tons having been despatched thither at the
beginning of the year.Coal of good quality is found in several parts
of the Transvaal and Natal, but progress in the development of the mines
has been so slow that almost the total demand is supplied by Wales.Cape Colony has an extensive petroleum field, but it is in the hands of
concessionaires, who, for reasons of their own, refuse to develop it.American and Russian petroleums are used exclusively, but the former is
preferred, and is rapidly crowding the other out of the market.Among the many other articles of export to South Africa are flour, corn,
butter, potatoes, canned meats, and vegetables--all of which might be
produced in the country if South Africans took advantage of the
opportunities offered by soil and Nature.American live stock has been
introduced into the country since the rinderpest disease destroyed
almost all of the native cattle, and with such successful results that
several Western firms have established branches in Cape Town, and are
sending thither large cargoes of mules, horses, cattle, and sheep.Cecil J. Rhodes has recently stocked his immense Rhodesian farm with
American live stock, and, as his example is generally followed
throughout the country, a decided increase in the live-stock export
trade is anticipated.Statistics only can give an adequate idea of American trade with South
Africa; but even these are not reliable, for the reason that a large
percentage of the exports sent to the country are ordered through London
firms, and consequently do not appear in the official figures.As a
criterion of what the trade amounts to, it will only be necessary to
quote a few statistics, which, however, do not represent the true totals
for the reason given.The estimated value of the exports and the
percentage increase of each year's business over that of the preceding
year is given, in order that a true idea of the growth of American trade
with South Africa may be formed:

    YEAR.Per cent
                                         increase.1895                  $5,000,000
    1896                  12,000,000        140
    1897                  16,000,000         33 1/8
    1898 (estimated)      20,000,000         25


A fact that is deplored by Americans who are eager to see their country
in the van in all things pertaining to trade is that almost every
dollar's worth of this vast amount of material is carried to South
Africa in ships sailing under foreign colours.Three lines of
steamships, having weekly sailings, ply between the two countries, and
are always laden to the rails with American goods, but the American flag
is carried by none of them.A fourth line of steamships, to ply between
Philadelphia and Cape Town, is about to be established under American
auspices, and is to carry the American flag.A number of small American
sailing vessels trade between the two countries, but their total
capacity is so small as to be almost insignificant when compared with
the great volume carried in foreign bottoms.The American imports from South Africa are of far less value than the
exports, for the reason that the country produces only a few articles
that are not consumed where they originate.America is the best market
in the world for diamonds, and about one fourth of the annual output of
the Kimberley mines reaches the United States.Hides and tallow
constitute the leading exportations to America, while aloes and ostrich
feathers are chief among the few other products sent here.Owing to this
lack of exports, ships going to South Africa are obliged to proceed to
India or Australia for return cargoes in order to reduce the expenses of
the voyage.However great the commercial interests of the United States in South
Africa, they are small in comparison with the work of individual
Americans, who have been active in the development of that country
during the last quarter of a century.Wherever great enterprises have
been inaugurated, Americans have been prominently identified with their
growth and development, and in not a few instances has the success of
the ventures been wholly due to American leadership.European capital
is the foundation of all the great South African institutions, but it is
to American skill that almost all of them owe the success which they
have attained.British and continental capitalists have recognised the superiority of
American methods by intrusting the management of almost every large mine
and industry to men who were born and received their training in the
United States.It is an expression not infrequently heard when the
success of a South African enterprise is being discussed, "Who is the
Yankee?"The reason of this is involved in the fact that almost all the
Americans who went to South Africa after the discovery of gold had been
well fitted by their experiences in the California and Colorado mining
fields for the work which they were called upon to do on the Randt, and,
owing to their ability, were able to compete successfully with the men
from other countries who were not so skilled.Unfortunately, not all the Americans in South Africa have been a credit
to their native country, and there is a considerable class which has
created for itself an unenviable reputation.The component parts of
this class are men who, by reason of criminal acts, were obliged to
leave America for new fields of endeavour, and non-professional men who
follow gold booms in all parts of the world and trust to circumstances
for a livelihood.In the early days of the Johannesburg gold fields
these men oftentimes resorted to desperate means, with the result that
almost every criminal act of an unusually daring description is now
credited against them by the orderly inhabitants.Highwaymen,
pickpockets, illicit gold buyers, confidence men, and even train-robbers
were active, and for several years served to discredit the entire
American colony.Since the first gold excitement has subsided, this
class of Americans, in which was also included by the residents all the
other criminal characters of whatever nationality, has been compelled to
leave the country, and to-day the American colony in Johannesburg
numbers about three thousand of the most respected citizens of the city.The American who has been most prominent in South African affairs, and
the stanchest supporter of American interests in that country, is
Gardner F. Williams, the general manager and one of the alternate life
governors of the De Beers Consolidated Diamond Mines at Kimberley.Williams gained his mining experience in the
mining districts of California and other Western States, and went to
South Africa in 1887 to take charge of the Kimberley mines, which were
then in an almost chaotic condition.By the application of American
ideas, Mr.Williams succeeded in making of the mines a property which
yields an annual profit of about ten million dollars on a nominal
capital of twice that amount.He has introduced American machinery into
the mines, and has been instrumental in many other ways in advancing the
interests of his native country.Williams receives a salary
twice as great as that of the President of the United States, he is
proud to be the American consular agent at Kimberley--an office which
does not carry with it sufficient revenue to provide the star-spangled
banner which constantly floats from a staff in front of his residence.J. Perrott Prince is another American who has assisted materially in
extending American interests in South Africa, and it is due to his own
unselfish efforts that the commerce of the United States with the port
of Durban has risen from insignificant volume to its present size.Prince was a surgeon in the Union army during the civil war, and
afterward was one of the first Americans to go to the Kimberley diamond
fields.Leander Starr Jameson to
accompany him to Kimberley in the capacity of assistant surgeon--a
service which he performed with great distinction until Mr.Rhodes sent
him into Matabeleland to take charge of the military forces, which later
he led into the Transvaal.Prince's renown as a physician was responsible for a call to
Madagascar, whither he was summoned by Queen Ranavalo.He remained in
Madagascar as the queen's physician until the French took forcible
possession of the island and sent the queen into exile on the Reunion
Islands.Prince has lived in Durban, Natal, for several years, and
during the greater part of that time conducted the office of American
consular agent at a financial loss to himself.Prince was obliged to end his connection with the consular service, and
the United States are now represented in Durban by a foreigner, who on
the last Fourth of July inquired why all the Americans in the city were
making such elaborate displays of bunting and the Stars and Stripes.The consular agent at Johannesburg is John C. Manion, of Herkimer, N.Y.,
who represents a large American machinery company.Manion, in 1896,
carried on the negotiations with the Transvaal Government by which John
Hays Hammond, an American mining engineer, was released from the
Pretoria prison, where he had been confined for complicity in the
uprising at Johannesburg.American machinery valued at several million
dollars has been sent to South Africa as the result of Mr.In the gold industry on the Randt, Americans have been specially active,
and it is due to one of them, J. S. Curtis, that the deep-level mines
were discovered.In South Africa a mining claim extends only a
specified distance below the surface of the earth, and the Governments
do not allow claim-owners to dig beyond that depth.Curtis found
that paying reefs existed below the specified depth, and the result was
that the Government sold the underground or deep-level claims with great
profit to itself and the mining community.The consulting engineers of almost all the mines of any importance in
the country are Americans, and their salaries range from ten thousand to
one hundred thousand dollars a year.John Hays Hammond, who was one of
the first American engineers to reach the gold fields, was official
mining engineer for the Transvaal Government, and received a yearly
salary of twenty-five thousand dollars for formulating the mining laws
of the country.He resigned that office, and is now the consulting
engineer for the British South Africa Company in Rhodesia and several
gold mines on the Randt, at salaries which aggregate almost one hundred
thousand dollars a year.Among the scores of other American engineers on
the Randt are L. I. Seymour, who has control of the thirty-six shafts of
the Randt Mines; Captain Malan, of the Robinson mines; and H. S. Watson,
of the Simmer en Jack mines, in developing which more than ten million
dollars have been spent.Another American introduced the system of treating the abandoned
tailings of the mines by the cyanide process, whereby thousands of
ounces of gold have been abstracted from the offal of the mills, which
had formerly been considered valueless.Others have revolutionized
different parts of the management of the mines, and in many instances
have taken abandoned properties and placed them on a paying basis.It
would not be fair to claim that American ingenuity and skill are
responsible for the entire success of the Randt gold mines, but it is
indisputable that Americans have done more toward it than the combined
representatives of all other nations.Every line of business on the Randt has its American representatives,
and almost without exception the firms who sent them thither chose able
men.W. E. Parks, of Chicago, represents Frazer & Chalmers, whose
machinery is in scores of the mines.His assistant is W. H. Haig, of
New York city.The American Trading and Importing Company, with its headquarters in
Johannesburg, and branches in every city and town in the country, deals
exclusively in American manufactured products, and annually sells
immense quantities of bicycles, stoves, beer, carriages, and other
goods, ranging from pins to pianos.Americans do not confine their endeavours to commercial enterprises, and
they may be found conducting missionary work among the Matabeles and
Mashonas, as well as building dams in Rhodesia.American missionaries
are very active in all parts of South Africa, and because of the
practical methods by which they endeavour to civilize and Christianize
the natives they have the reputation throughout the country of being
more successful than those who go there from any other country.Rhodes has given many contributions of land and
money to the American missionaries, and has on several occasions
complimented them by pronouncing their achievements unparalleled.A practical illustration will demonstrate the causes of the success of
the American missionary.An English missionary spent the first two
years after his arrival in the country in studying the natives' language
and in building a house for himself.In that time he had made no
converts.An American missionary arrived at almost the same time,
rented a hut, and hired interpreters.At the end of two years he had
one hundred and fifty converts, many more natives who were learning
useful occupations and trades, and had sent home a request for more
missionaries with which to extend his field.It is rather remarkable that the scouts who assisted in subduing the
American Indians should later be found on the African continent to
assist in the extermination of the blacks.In the Matabele and Mashona
campaigns of three years ago, Americans who scouted for Custer and Miles
on the Western plains were invaluable adjuncts to the British forces,
and in many instances did heroic work in finding the location of the
enemy and in making way for the American Maxim guns that were used in
the campaigns.The Americans in South Africa, although only about ten thousand in
number, have been of invaluable service to the land.They have taught
the farmers to farm, the miners to dig gold, and the statesmen to
govern.Their work has been a credit to the country which they continue
to revere, and whose flag they raise upon every proper occasion.They
have taken little part in the political disturbances of the Transvaal,
because they believe that the citizens of a republic should be allowed
to conduct its government according to their own idea of right and
justice, independently of the demands of those who are not citizens.CHAPTER XII

                         JOHANNESBURG OF TO-DAY


The palms and bamboos of Durban, the Zulu policemen and 'ricksha boys,
and the hospitable citizens have been left behind, and the little train
of English compartment cars, each with its destination "Johannesburg"
labelled conspicuously on its sides, is winding away through cane fields
and banana groves, past groups of open-eyed natives and solemn,
thin-faced Indian coolies.Pretty little farmers' cottages in settings of palms, mimosas, and
tropical plants are dotted in the green valleys winding around the
innumerable small hills that look for all the world like so many
inverted moss-covered china cups.Lumbering transport wagons behind a
score of sleek oxen, wincing under the fire of the far-reaching rawhide
in the hands of a sparsely clad Zulu driver, are met and passed in a
twinkling.Neatly thatched huts with natives lazily lolling in the sun
become more frequent as the train rolls on toward the interior, and the
greenness of the landscape is changing into the brown of dead verdure,
for it is the dry season--the South African winter.The hills become
more frequent, and the little locomotive goes more slowly, while the
train twists and writhes along its path like a huge python.Now it is on the hilltop from which the distant sea and its coast fringe
of green are visible on the one side, and nothing but treeless brown
mountain tops on the other.A minute later it plunges down the
hillside, along rocky precipices, over deep chasms, and then wearily
plods up the zigzag course of another hillside.For five hours or more
the monotony of miniature mountains continues, relieved by nothing more
interesting than the noise of the train and the hilarious laughter and
weird songs of a car load of Zulus bound for the gold fields.After
this comes an undulating plain and towns with far less interest in their
appearance than in their names.The traveller surfeited with Natal
scenery finds amusement and diversion in the conductor's call of Umbilo,
Umkomaas, Umgeni, Amanzimtoti, Isipingo, Mooi River, Zwartkop, or
Pietermaritzburg, but will not attempt to learn the proper pronunciation
of the names unless he has weeks at his command.[Illustration: Zulu maidens shaking hands.]Farther on in the journey an ostrich, escaped from a farm, stalks over
the plain, and, approaching to within several yards of the train, jogs
along for many miles, and perchance wheedles the engineer into impromptu
races.Hardly has the bird disappeared when on the wide veldt a herd of
buck galloping with their long heads down, or a large number of
wildebeest, plunging and jumping like animated hobby-horses, raise
clouds of dust as they dash away from the monster of iron and steam.Shortly afterward the train passes a waterfall almost thrice as lofty as
Niagara, but located in the middle of the plain, into whose surface the
water has riven a deep and narrow chasm.Since the balmy Indian Ocean has been left behind, the train has been
rising steadily, sometimes an inch in a mile but oftener a hundred feet,
and the air has grown cooler.The thousands of British soldiers at
Ladysmith are wearing heavy clothing; their horses, tethered in the open
air, are shivering, and far to the westward is the cause of it all--the
lofty, snow-covered peaks of the Dragon Mountain.Night comes on and
clothes the craggy mountains and broken valleys with varying shades of
sombreness.The moon outlines the snow far above, and with its rays
marks the lofty line where sky and mountain crest seem to join.Morning
light greets the train as it dashes down the mountain side, through the
passes that connect Natal with the Transvaal and out upon the withered
grass of the flat, uninteresting veldt of the Boer country.The South African veldt in all its winter hideousness lies before you.It stretches out in all directions--to the north and south, to the east
and west--and seems to have no boundaries.Its yellowish brownness eats
into the brain, and the eyes grow weary from the monotony of the scene.Hour after hour the train bears onward in a straight line, but the
landscape remains the same.But for noises and motions of the cars you
would imagine that the train was stationary, so far as change of scenery
is concerned.Occasionally a colony of huge ant-heaps or a few buck or
deer may be passed, but for hours it is veldt, veldt, veldt!An entire
day's journey, unrelieved except toward the end by a few straggling
towns of Boer farmhouses or the sheet-iron cabins of prospectors, bring
it to Heidelberg, once the metropolis as well as the capital of the
republic, but now pining because the former distinguishing mark has been
yielded to its neighbour, Johannesburg.As the shades of another night commence to fall, the veldt suddenly
assumes a new countenance.Lights begin to sparkle, buildings close
together appear, and scores of tall smokestacks tower against the
background of the sky.The presence of the smoke-stacks denote the
arrival at the Randt, and for twenty miles the train rushes along this
well-defined gold-yielding strip of land.Buildings, lights, stacks,
and people become more numerous as the train progresses into the city
limits of Johannesburg, and the traveller soon finds himself in the
middle of a crowd of enthusiastic welcoming and welcomed persons on the
platform of the station of the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche
Spoorweg-Maatschappij, and in the Golden City.The sudden change from the dreary lifelessness of the veldt to the
exciting crush and bustle of the station platform crowd is almost
bewildering, because it is so different from what is expected in
interior Africa.The station, a magnificent structure of stone and
iron, presents more animated scenes whenever trains arrive than the
Grand Central in New York or the Victoria in London, because every
passenger is invariably met at the train by all his friends and as many
of their friends as the station platform will accommodate.The crowd
which surges around this centre of the city's life is of a more
cosmopolitan character than that which can be found in any other city in
the world with the exceptions of Zanzibar and Port Said.Almost every
race is represented in the gathering, which is suggestive of a mass
meeting of the villagers of the Midway Plaisance at the Columbian
Exposition.In the crowd are stolid Anglo-Saxons shaking hands
effusively; enthusiastic Latins embracing each other; <DW64>s rubbing
noses and cheeks; smiling Japanese; cold, stern Chinese; Cingalese,
Russians, Malays, and Egyptians--all in their national costumes, and all
welcoming friends in their native manner and language.Meandering
through the crowd are several keen-eyed Boer policemen, commonly called
"Zarps," politely directing the attention of innocent-looking newcomers
to placards bearing the inscription "Pas op Zakkenrollers," which is the
Boer warning of pickpockets.After the traveller has forced a way through the crowd he is attacked by
a horde of cabmen who can teach tricks of the trade to the London and
New York night-hawks.Their equipages range from dilapidated broughams
to antique 'rickshas, but their charges are the same--"a quid," or five
dollars, either for a mile or a minute's ride.After the insults which
follow a refusal to enter one of their conveyances have subsided, the
agents of the hotels commence a vociferous campaign against the
newcomers, and very clever it is in its way.They are able to
distinguish a foreigner at one glance, and will change the name of the
hotel which they represent a score of times in as many seconds in order
to bag their quarry.For the patriotic American they have the New York
Hotel, the Denver House, the Hotel California, and many other hostelries
named after American cities.they will salute an American,
"Come up to the New York Hotel and patronize American enterprise."If
the traveller will accompany one of these agents he will find that all
the names apply to one hotel, which has an American name but is
conducted and patronized by a low class of foreigners.The victim of
misrepresentation will seek another hotel, and will be fortunate if he
finds comfortable quarters for less than ten dollars a day, or three
times the amount he would be called upon to pay at a far better hotel in
any American city of equal size.The privilege of fasting, or of
awakening in the morning with a layer of dust an eighth of an inch deep
on the counterpane and on the face may be ample return for the
extraordinary charges, but the stranger in the city is not apt to adopt
that view of the situation until he is acclimated.The person who has spent several days in crossing the veldt and enters
Johannesburg by night has a strange revelation before him when he is
awakened the following morning.He has been led to believe that the city
is a motley collection of corrugated-iron hovels, hastily constructed
cabins, and cheap public buildings.Instead he finds a beautiful city,
with well-paved streets, magnificent buildings of stone and brick,
expensive public buildings, and scores of palatial residences.Many
American cities of the same size and many times older can not show as
costly buildings or as fine public works.Hotels of five and six
stories, and occupying, in several instances, almost entire blocks, are
numerous; of office buildings costing a quarter of a million dollars
each there are half a score; banks, shops, and newspapers have three-
and four-story buildings of brick and stone, while there are hundreds of
other buildings that would be creditable to any large city in America or
Europe.The Government Building in the centre of the city is a
five-story granite structure of no mean architectural beauty.In the
suburbs are many magnificent private residences of mine owners and
managers who, although not permanent residents of the city, have
invested large amounts of money, so that the short time they spend in
the country may be amid luxurious and comfortable surroundings.One of the disagreeable features of living in Johannesburg is the dust
which is present everywhere during the dry season.It rises in great,
thick clouds on the surrounding veldt, and, obscuring the sun, wholly
envelops the city in semi-darkness.One minute the air is clear and
there is not a breath of wind; several minutes later a hurricane is
blowing and blankets of dust are falling.The dust clouds generally
rise west of the city, and almost totally eclipse the sun during their
progress over the plain.Sometimes the dust storms continue only a few
minutes, but very frequently the citizens are made uncomfortable by them
for days at a time.Whenever they arrive, the doors and windows of
buildings are tightly closed, business is practically at a standstill,
and every one is miserable.It penetrates
every building, however well protected, and it lodges in the food as
well as in the drink.Pedestrians on the street are unable to see ten
feet ahead, and are compelled to walk with head bowed and with
handkerchief over the mouth and nostrils.Umbrellas and parasols are
but slight protection against it.Only the miners, a thousand feet
below the surface, escape it.When the storm has subsided the entire
city is covered with a blanket of dust ranging in thickness from an inch
on the sidewalks to an eighth of an inch on the store counters,
furniture, and in pantries.It has never been computed how great a
quantity of the dust enters a man's lungs, but the feeling that it
engenders is one of colossal magnitude.Second to the dust, the main characteristic of Johannesburg is the
inhabitants' great struggle for sudden wealth.It is doubtful whether
there is one person in the city whose ambition is less than to become
wealthy in five years at least, and then to return to his native
country.It is not a chase after affluence; it is a stampede in which
every soul in the city endeavours to be in the van.In the city and in
the mines there are hundreds of honourable ways of becoming rich, but
there are thousands of dishonourable ones; and the morals of a mining
city are not always on the highest plane.There are business men of the
strictest probity and honesty, and men whose word is as good as their
bond, but there are many more who will allow their conscience to lie
dormant so long as they remain in the country.With them the passion is
to secure money, and whether they secure it by overcharging a regular
customer, selling illicit gold, or gambling at the stock exchanges is a
matter of small moment.Tradesmen and shopkeepers will charge according
to the apparel of the patron, and will brazenly acknowledge doing so if
reminded by the one who has paid two prices for like articles the same
day.Hotels charge according to the quantity of luggage the traveller
carries, and boarding-houses compute your wealth before presenting their
bills.Street-car fares and postage stamps alone do not fluctuate in
value, but the wise man counts his change.The experiences of an American with one large business house in the city
will serve as an example of the methods of some of those who are eager
to realize their ambitions.The American spent many weeks and much
patience and money in securing photographs throughout the country, and
took the plates to a large firm in Johannesburg for development and
printing.When he returned two weeks later he was informed that the
plates and prints had been delivered a week before, and neither prayers
nor threats secured a different answer.Justice in the courts is slow
and costly, and the American was obliged to leave the country without
his property.Shortly after his departure the firm of photographers
commenced selling a choice collection of new South African photographs
which, curiously, were of the same scenes and persons photographed by
the American.Gambling may be more general in some other cities, but it can not be
more public.The more refined gamblers patronize the two stock
exchanges, and there are but few too poor to indulge in that form of
dissipation.Probably nine tenths of the inhabitants of the city travel
the stock-exchange bypath to wealth or poverty.Women and boys are as
much infected by the fever as mine owners and managers, and it would not
be slandering the citizens to say that one fourth of the conversation
heard on the streets refers to the rise and fall of stocks.The popular gathering place in the city is the street in front of one of
the stock exchanges known as "The Chains."During the session of the
exchange the street is crowded with an excited throng of men, boys, and
even women, all flushed with the excitement of betting on the rise and
fall of mining stocks in the building.Clerks, office boys, and miners
spend the lunch hour at "The Chains," either to invest their wages or to
watch the market if their money is already invested.A fall in the
value of stocks is of far greater moment to them than war, famine, or
pestilence.The passion for gambling is also satisfied by a giant lottery scheme
known as "Sweepstakes," which has the sanction of the Government.Thousands of pounds are offered as prizes at the periodical drawings,
and no true Johannesburger ever fails to secure at least one ticket for
the drawing.When there are no sessions of the stock exchanges, no
sweepstakes, horse races, ball games, or other usual opportunities for
gambling, they will bet on the arrival of the Cape train, the length of
a sermon, or the number of lashes a <DW64> criminal can endure before
fainting.Drinking is a second diversion which occupies much of the time of the
average citizen, because of the great heat and the lack of amusement.The liquor that is drunk in Johannesburg in one year would make a stream
of larger proportions and far more healthier contents than the Vaal
River in the dry season.It is a rare occurrence to see a man drink
water unless it is concealed in brandy, and at night it is even rarer
that one is seen who is not drinking.Cape Smoke, the name given to a
liquor made in Cape Colony, is credited with the ability to kill a man
before he has taken the glass from his lips, but the popular Uitlander
beverage, brandy and soda, is even more fatal in its effects.Pure
liquor is almost unobtainable, and death-dealing counterfeits from
Delagoa Bay are the substitutes.Twenty-five cents for a glass of beer
and fifty cents for brandy and soda are not deterrent prices where
ordinary mine workers receive ten dollars a day and mine managers fifty
thousand dollars a year.Of social life there is little except such as is afforded by the clubs,
of which there are several of high standing.The majority of the men
left their families in their native countries on account of the severe
climate, and that fact, combined with the prevalent idea that the
weather is too torrid to do anything unnecessary, is responsible for
Johannesburg's lack of social amenity.There are occasional dances and
receptions, but they are participated in only by newcomers who have not
yet fallen under the spell of the South African sun.The Sunday night's
musical entertainments at the Wanderer's Club are practically the only
affairs to which the average Uitlander cares to go, because he can
clothe himself for comfort and be as dignified or as undignified as he
pleases.The true Johannesburger is the most independent man in the world.When
he meets a native on the sidewalk he promptly kicks him into the street,
and if the action is resented, bullies a Boer policeman into arresting
the offender.The policeman may demur and call the Johannesburger a
"Verdomde rooinek," but he will make the arrest or receive a drubbing.He may be arrested in turn, but he is ever willing and anxious to pay a
fine for the privilege of beating a "dumb Dutchman," as he calls him.He pays little attention to the laws of the country, because he has not
had the patience to learn what they consist of, and he rests content in
knowing that his home government will rescue him through diplomatic
channels if he should run counter to the laws.He cares nothing
concerning the government of the city except as it interferes with or
assists his own private interests, but he will take advantage of every
opportunity to defy the authority of the administrators of the laws.He
despises the Boers, and continually and maliciously ridicules them on
the slightest pretexts.Specially true is this of those newspapers
which are the representatives of the Uitlander population.Venomous
editorials against the Boer Government and people appear almost daily,
and serve to widen the breach between the two classes of inhabitants.The Boer newspapers for a long time ignored the assaults of the
Uitlander press, but recently they have commenced to retaliate, and the
editorial war is a bitter one.An extract from the Randt Post will show
the nature and depth of bitterness displayed by the two classes of
newspapers:

"Though Dr.Leyds may be right, and the Johannesburg population safe in
case of war, we advise that, at the first act of war on the English
side, the women and children, and well-disposed persons of this town, be
given twenty-four hours to leave, and then the whole place be shot down;
in the event, we repeat--which God forbid!--of war coming."If, indeed, there must be shooting, then it will be on account of
seditious words and deeds of Johannesburg agitators and the
co-shareholders in Cape Town and London, and the struggle will be
promoted for no other object than the possession of the gold.Well,
then, let such action be taken that the perpetrators of these turbulent
proceedings shall, if caught, be thrown into the deep shafts of their
mines, with the debris of the batteries for a costly shroud, and that
the whole of Johannesburg, with the exception of the Afrikander wards,
be converted into a gigantic rubbish heap to serve as a mighty tombstone
for the shot-down authors of a monstrous deed."If it be known that these valuable buildings and the lives of the
wire-pullers are the price of the mines, then people will take good heed
before the torch of war is set alight.Friendly talks and protests are
no use with England.Let force and rough violence be opposed to the
intrigues and plots of Old England, and only then will the Boer remain
master."It is on Saturday nights that the bitterness of the Uitlander population
is most noticeable, since then the workers from the mines along the
Randt gather in the city and discuss their grievances, which then become
magnified with every additional glass of liquor.It is then that the
city streets and places of amusement and entertainment are crowded with
a throng that finds relaxation by abusing the Boers.The theatre
audiences laugh loudest at the coarsest jests made at the expense of the
Boers, and the bar-room crowds talk loudest when the Boers are the
subject of discussion.The abuse continues even when the not-too-sober
Uitlander, wheeled homeward at day-break by his faithful Zulu 'ricksha
boy, casts imprecations upon the Boer policeman who is guarding his
property.Johannesburg is one of the most expensive places of residence in the
world.Situated in the interior of the continent, thousands of miles
distant from the sources of food and supplies, it is natural that
commodities should be high in price.Almost all food stuffs are carried
thither from America, Europe, and Australia, and consequently the
original cost is trebled by the addition of carriage and customs duties.The most common articles of food are twice as costly as in America,
while such commodities as eggs, imported from Madeira, frequently are
scarce at a dollar a dozen.Butter from America is fifty cents a pound,
and fruits and vegetables from Cape Colony and Natal are equally high in
price and frequently unobtainable.Good board can not be obtained
anywhere for less than five dollars a day, while the best hotels and
clubs charge thrice that amount.Rentals are exceptionally high owing
to the extraordinary land values and the cost of erecting buildings.A
small, brick-lined, corrugated-iron cottage of four rooms, such as a
married mine-employee occupies, costs from fifty to seventy-five dollars
a month, while a two-story brick house in a respectable quarter of the
city rents for one hundred dollars a month.Every object in the city is mutely expressive of a vast expenditure of
money.The idea that everything--the buildings, food, horses, clothing,
machinery, and all that is to be seen--has been carried across oceans
and continents unconsciously associates itself with the cost that it has
entailed.Four-story buildings that in New York or London would be
passed without remark cause mental speculation concerning their cost,
merely because it is so patent that every brick, nail, and board in them
has been conveyed thousands of miles from foreign shores.Electric
lights and street cars, so common in American towns, appear abnormal in
the city in the veldt, and instantly suggest an outlay of great amounts
of money even to the minds which are not accustomed to reducing
everything to dollars and pounds.Leaving the densely settled centre of
the city, where land is worth as much as choice plots on Broadway, and
wandering into the suburbs where the great mines are, the idea of cost
is more firmly implanted into the mind.The huge buildings, covering
acres of ground and thousands of tons of the most costly machinery, seem
to be of natural origin rather than of human handiwork.It is almost
beyond belief that men should be daring enough to convey hundreds of
steamer loads of lumber and machinery halfway around the world at
inestimable cost merely for the yellow metal that Nature has hidden so
far distant from the great centres of population.The cosmopolitanism of the city is a feature which impresses itself most
indelibly upon the mind.In a half-day's stroll in the city
representatives of all the peoples of the earth, with the possible
exception of the American Indian, Eskimos, and South Sea islanders, will
be seen variously engaged in the struggle for gold.On the floors of the
stock exchanges are money barons or their agents, as energetic and sharp
as their prototypes of Wall and Throckmorton Streets.These are chiefly
British, French, and German.Outside, between "The Chains," are readily
discernible the distinguishing features of the Americans, Afrikanders,
Portuguese, Russians, Spaniards, and Italians.A few steps distant is
Commissioner Street, the principal thoroughfare, where the surging
throng is composed of so many different racial representatives that an
analysis of it is not an easy undertaking.He is considered an expert
who can name the native country of every man on the street, and if he
can distinguish between an American and a Canadian he is credited with
being a wise man.In the throng is the tall, well-clothed Briton, with silk hat and frock
coat, closely followed by a sparsely clad Matabele, bearing his master's
account books or golf-sticks.Near them a Chinaman, in circular
red-topped hat and flowing silk robes, is having a heated argument in
broken English with an Irish hansom-driver.Crossing the street are two
stately Arabs, in turbans and white robes, jostling easy-going Indian
coolies with their canes.Bare-headed Cingalese, their long, shiny hair
tied in knots and fastened down with circular combs, noiselessly gliding
along, or stopping suddenly to trade Oriental jewelry for Christian's
money; Malays, Turks, Egyptians, Persians, and New-Zealanders, each with
his distinctive costume; Hottentots, Matabeles, Zulus, Mashonas,
Basutos, and the representatives of hundreds of the other native races
south of the Zambezi pass by in picturesque lack of bodily adornment.It is an imposing array, too, for the majority of the throng is composed
of moderately wealthy persons, and even in the centre of Africa wealth
carries with it opportunities for display.John Chinaman will ride in a
'ricksha to his joss-house with as much conscious pride as the European
or American will sit in his brougham or automobile.Money is as easily
spent as made in Johannesburg, and it is a cosmopolitan habit to spend
it in a manner so that everybody will know it is being spent.To make a
display of some sort is necessary to the citizen's happiness.If he is
not of sufficient importance to have his name in the subsidized
newspapers daily he will seek notoriety by wearing a thousand pounds'
worth of diamonds on the street or making astonishing bets at the
race-track.In that little universe on the veldt every man tries to be
superior to his neighbour in some manner that may be patent to all the
city.When it is taken into consideration that almost all the
contestants were among the cleverest and shrewdest men in the countries
whence they came to Johannesburg, and not among the riffraff and
failures, then the intensity of the race for superiority can be
imagined.Johannesburg might be named the City of Surprises.Its youthful
existence has been fraught with astonishing works.It was born in a
day, and one day's revolution almost ended its existence.It grew from
the desert veldt into a garden of gold.Its granite residences, brick
buildings, and iron and steel mills sprang from blades of grass and
sprigs of weeds.It has transformed the beggar into a millionaire, and
it has seen starving men in its streets.It harbours men from every
nation and climate, but it is a home for few.It is far from the centre
of the earth's civilization, but it has often attracted the whole
world's attention.It supports its children, but by them it is cursed.Its god is in the earth upon which it rests, and its hope of future life
in that which it brings forth.And all this because a man upturned the
soil and called it gold.Ich will nicht sagen,
dass Sie die Analogie ganz auf ihrer Seite haben dürften.Aber was die
Leser vors erste bey dem Worte noch nicht denken mögen, sie sich nach
und nach dabey zu denken gewöhnen.”[21]

The statement that Sterne coined the word “sentimental” is undoubtedly
incorrect,[22] but no one seems to have discovered and corrected the
error till Nicolai’s article on Sterne in the _Berlinische
Monatsschrift_ for February, 1795, in which it is shown that the word
had been used in older English novels, in “Sir Charles Grandison”
indeed.[23] It may well be that, as Böttiger hints,[24] the coining of
the word “empfindsam” was suggested to Lessing by Abbt’s similar
formation of “empfindnisz.”[25]

  [Transcriber’s Note:
  The reference is to Böttinger, not to the present text.]The preface to this first edition of Bode’s translation of the
Sentimental Journey contains, further, a sketch of Sterne’s life,[26]
his character and his works.Bode relates the familiar story of the dog,
but misses the point entirely in rendering “puppy” by “Geck” in Sterne’s
reply, “So lang er ein Geck ist.” The watchcoat episode is narrated, and
a brief account is given of Sterne’s fortunes in London with Tristram
Shandy and the sermons.Allusion has already been made to the hints
thrown out in this sketch relative to the reading of Sterne in Germany.A translation from Shandy of the passage descriptive of Parson Yorick
serves as a portrait for Sterne.A second edition of Bode’s work was published in 1769.The preface,
which is dated “Anfang des Monats Mai, 1769,” is in the main identical
with the first, but has some significant additions.A word is said
relative to his controversy with a critic, which is mentioned later.[27]
Bode confesses further that the excellence of his work is due to Ebert
and Lessing,[28] though modesty compelled his silence in the previous
preface concerning the source of his aid.Bode admits that even this
disclosure is prompted by the clever guess of a critic in the
_Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent_,[29] who openly named
Lessing as the scholar referred to in the first introduction.The
addition and prominence of Ebert’s name is worthy of note, for in spite
of the plural mention[30] in the appendix to the introduction, his first
acknowledgment is to one friend only and there is no suggestion of
another counselor.Ebert’s connection with the Bode translation has been
overlooked in the distribution of influence, while the memorable coining
of the new word, supplemented by Böttiger’s unsubstantiated statements,
has emphasized Lessing’s service in this regard.Ebert is well-known as
an intelligent and appreciative student of English literature, and as a
translator, but his own works betray no trace of imitation or admiration
of Sterne.The final words of this new preface promise a translation of the
continuation of the Sentimental Journey; the spurious volumes of
Eugenius are, of course, the ones meant here.This introduction to the
second edition remains unchanged in the subsequent ones.The text of the
second edition was substantially an exact reproduction of the first,
but Bode allowed himself frequent minor changes of word or phrase, an
alteration occurring on an average once in about three pages.Bode’s
changes are in general the result of a polishing or filing process, in
the interest of elegance of discourse, or accuracy of translation.Bode
acknowledges that some of the corrections were those suggested by a
reviewer,[31] but states that other passages criticised were allowed to
stand as they were.He says further that he would have asked those
friends who had helped him on his translation itself to aid him in the
alterations, if distance and other conditions had allowed.The reference
here is naturally to his separation from Ebert, who was in Braunschweig,
but the other “conditions” which could prevent a continuation of
Lessing’s interest in the translation and his assistance in revision are
not evident.Lessing was in Hamburg during this period, and hence his
advice was available.Bode’s retranslation of the passage with which Sterne’s work closed
shows increased perception and appreciation for the subtleness of
Sterne’s indecent suggestions, or, perhaps, a growing lack of timidity
or scruple in boldly repeating them.It is probable that the
continuation by Eugenius, which had come into his hands during this
period, had, with its resumption of the point, reminded Bode of the
inadequacy and inexactness of his previous rendering.At almost precisely the same time that Bode’s translation appeared,
another German rendering was published, a fact which in itself is
significant for the determination of the relative strength of appeal as
between Sterne’s two works of fiction.The title[32] of this version was
“Versuch über die menschliche Natur in Herrn Yoricks, Verfasser des
Tristram Shandy, Reisen durch Frankreich und Italien, aus dem
Englischen.” It was dated 1769 and was published at the “Fürstliche
Waisenhausbuchhandlung,” in Braunschweig.The preface is signed
Braunschweig, September 7, 1768, and the book was issued in September or
October.The anonymous translator was Pastor Mittelstedt[33] in
Braunschweig (Hirsching und Jördens say Hofprediger), whom the partisan
Böttiger calls the ever-ready manufacturer of translations (der allezeit
fertige Uebersetzungsfabrikant).Behmer tentatively suggests Weis as the
translator of this early rendering, an error into which he is led
evidently by a remark in Bode’s preface in which the apologetic
translator states the rumor that Weis was engaged in translating the
same book, and that he (Bode) would surely have locked up his work in
his desk if the publisher had not thereby been led to suffer loss.This first edition of the Mittelstedt translation contains 248 pages and
is supplied with a preface which is, like Bode’s, concerned in
considerable measure with the perplexing problem of the translation of
Sterne’s title.The English title is given and the word “sentimental” is
declared a new one in England and untranslatable in German.Mittelstedt
proposes “Gefühlvolle Reisen,” “Reisen fürs Herz,” “Philosophische
Reisen,” and then condemns his own suggestions as indeterminate and
forced.He then goes on to say, “So I have chosen the title which Yorick
himself suggests in the first part.”[34] He speaks of the lavish praise
already bestowed on this book by the learned journals, and turns at last
aside to do the obvious: he bemoans Sterne’s death by quoting Hamlet and
closes with an apostrophe to Sterne translated from the April number of
the _Monthly Review_ for 1768.[35] In 1769, the year when the first
edition was dated, the Mittelstedt translation was published under a
slightly altered title, as already mentioned.This second edition of the
Mittelstedt translation in the same year as the first is overlooked by
Jördens and Hirsching,[36] both of whom give a second and hence really a
third edition in 1774.Böttiger notes with partisan zeal that Bode’s
translation was made use of in some of the alterations of this second
edition, and further records the fact that the account of Sterne’s life,
added in this edition, was actually copied from Bode’s preface.[37]

The publication of the Mittelstedt translation was the occasion of a
brief controversy between the two translators in contemporary journals.Mittelstedt printed his criticism of Bode’s work in a home paper, the
_Braunschweiger Intelligenzblätter_, and Bode spoke out his defense in
the _Neue Hamburger Zeitung_.That Bode in his second edition adopted
some of the reviewer’s suggestions and criticisms has been noted, but in
the preface to this edition he declines to resume the strife in spite of
general expectation of it, but, as a final shot, he delivers himself of
“an article from his critical creed,” that the “critic is as little
infallible as author or translator,” which seems, at any rate, a rather
pointless and insignificant contribution to the controversy.Bode’s translation of the third and fourth volumes of Yorick’s
Journey,[38] that is, the continuation by Eugenius, followed directly
after the announcement in the preface to the second edition of the first
two volumes, as already mentioned.Böttiger states that Bode had this
continuation from Alberti and knew it before anyone else in Germany.It
was published in England in the spring of 1769, and was greeted with a
disapproval which was quite general, and it never enjoyed there any
considerable genuine popularity or recognition.Bode published this
translation of Stevenson’s work without any further word of comment or
explanation whatsoever, a fact which easily paved the way for a
misunderstanding relative to the volumes, for Bode was frequently
regarded as their author and held responsible for their defects.Bode
himself never made any satisfactory or adequate explanation of his
attitude toward these volumes, and the reply to Goeze in the
introduction to his translation of Shandy is the nearest approach to a
discussion of his position.But there Bode is concerned only with the
attack made by the Hamburg pastor upon his character, an inference drawn
from the nature of the book translated, and the character of the
translation; in the absence of a new edition in which “Mine and His
shall be marked off by distinct boundaries,” he asks Goeze only to send
to him, and beg “for original and translation,” naturally for the
purpose of comparison.This evasive reply is Bode’s only defense or
explanation.Böttiger claims that the review of Bode’s translation in
the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ did much to spread the idea of
Bode’s authorship, though the reviewer in that periodical[39] only
suggests the possibility of German authorship, a suspicion aroused by
the substitution of German customs and motif and word-play, together
with contemporary literary allusion, allusion to literary mediocrities
and obscurities, of such a nature as to preclude the possibility of the
book’s being a literal translation from the English.The exact amount and the nature of Bode’s divergence from the original,
his alterations and additions, have never been definitely stated by
anyone.The reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ is
manifestly ignorant of the original.Böttiger is indefinite and
