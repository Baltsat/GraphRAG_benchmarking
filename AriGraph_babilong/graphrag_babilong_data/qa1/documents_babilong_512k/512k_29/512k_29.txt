bayonets--the other nets a bay.Ladies who wish the married state to gain,

      Was tall in stature and advanced in years,
    And leading long a solitary life
      Oft grieved her, even to the fall of tears.At length a neighbor, bachelor, and old,
      But not too old to match the Lady B----,
    Feeling his life monotonous and cold,
      Proposed to her that they should wedded be.Proposed, and was accepted--need we say?Even the wedding-day and dress were named;
    And gossips' tongues had conn'd the matter o'er--
      Some praised the union, others strongly blamed.The Lady B----, whose features were my _first_,
      Was well endowed with beauties that are rare,
    Well read, well spoken--had, indeed, a mind
      With which few of the sex called tender can compare.But the old bachelor had all the ways
      Of one grown fidgety in solitude;
    And he at once in matters not his own
      Began unseemly and untimely to intrude.What is the difference between a cloud and a whipped child?One pours
with rain, the other roars with pain!Because the worse people are the
more they are with them!If a dirty sick man be ordered to wash to get well, why is it like four

    My ancestors lived centuries before I gained my form.I always lived by sucking, I ne'er ate any bread,
    I wasn't good for anything till after I was dead.They bang'd and they whang'd me, they turned me outside in,
    They threw away my body, saved nothing but my skin.When I grew old and crazy--was quite worn out and thin,
    They tore me all to pieces, and made me up again.And then I traveled up and down the country for a teacher,
    To some of those who saw me, I was good as any preacher.Why is a jeweler like a screeching florid singer?Because he pierces
the ears for the sake of ornament!What sort of music should a girl sing whose voice is cracked and

would it remind you of?Why would an owl be offended at your calling him a pheasant?Because

sagacious pointer with him; this noble quadrupedal, and occasionally
graminiverous specimen, went not before, went not behind, nor on one
side of him; then where did the horrid brute go?Why, on the other side
of him, of course.My _first_, a messenger of gladness;
    My _last_, an instrument of sadness;
    My _whole_ looked down upon my last and smiled--
    Upon a wretch disconsolate and wild.But when my _whole_ looked down and smiled no more,
    That wretch's frenzy and his pain were o'er.Why is a bad hat like a fierce snarling pup dog?Because it snaps (its

protest and vow constancy, are always doubtful?Because they are only
miss givings.Why is a hunted fox like a Puseyite?Because he's a tracked-hairy-un
(tractarian).Why did Du Chaillu get so angry when he was quizzed about the gorilla?What's the difference between the cook at an eating-house and Du
Chaillu?One lives by the gridiron, the other by the g'riller.Why is the last conundrum like a monkey?Because it is far fetched and
full of nonsense.My first, loud chattering, through the air,
      Bounded'mid tree-tops high,
    Then saw his image mirror'd, where
      My second murmured by.Taking it for a friend, he strayed
      T'wards where the stream did roll,
    And was the sort of fool that's made
      The first day of my whole.What grows the less tired the more it works?Which would you rather, look a greater fool than you are, or be a
greater fool than you look?Let a person choose, then say, "That's
impossible."She was--we have every reason to
believe--Maid of Orleans!Which would you rather, that a lion ate you or a tiger?Why, you would
rather that the lion ate the tiger, of course!When he moves from one spot to
another!I paint without colors, I fly without wings,
    I people the air with most fanciful things;
    I hear sweetest music where no sound is heard,
    And eloquence moves me, nor utters a word.The past and the present together I bring,
    The distant and near gather under my wing.Far swifter than lightning my wonderful flight,
    Through the sunshine of day, or the darkness of night;
    And those who would find me, must find me, indeed,
    As this picture they scan, and this poesy read.A pudding-bag is a pudding-bag, and a pudding-bag has what everything
else has; what is it?Why was it, as an old woman in a scarlet cloak was crossing a field in
which a goat was browsing, that a most wonderful metamorphosis took
place?Because the goat turned to butter (butt her), and the antique
party to a scarlet runner!What is the most wonderful animal in the farm-yard?A pig, because he
is killed and then cured!Why does a stingy German like mutton better than venison?Because he
prefers "zat vich is sheep to zat vich is deer."'Twas winter, and some merry boys
      To their comrades beckoned,
    And forth they ran with laughing tongues,
      And much enjoyed my _second_.And as the sport was followed up,
      There rose a gladsome burst,
    When lucklessly amid their group
      One fell upon my _first_.There is with those of larger growth
      A winter of the soul,
    And when _they_ fall, too oft, alas!Why has the beast that carries the Queen of Siam's palanquin nothing
whatever to do with the subject?What did the seven wise men of Greece do when they met the sage of

Hercules?The one that is--Nessus-hairy!To be said to your _inamorata_, your lady love: What's the difference
between Jupiter and your very humble servant?Jupiter liked nectar and
ambrosia; I like to be next yer and embrace yer!Because she got a little
prophet (profit) from the rushes on the bank.Because its turning is the
result of conviction.What is the difference between a wealthy toper and a skillful miner?One turns his gold into quarts, the other turns his quartz into gold!Why is a mad bull an animal of convivial disposition?Because he offers
a horn to every one he meets.Why is a drunkard hesitating to sign the pledge like a skeptical

    I am with thee, child of man;
    With thee still from first to last,
    In pain and pleasure, feast and fast,
    At thy cradle and thy death,
    Thine earliest wail and dying breath,
    Seek thou not to shun or save,
    On the earth or in the grave;
    The worm and I, the worm and I,
    In the grave together lie.The letter A.

      (Well suited to the season)
    Had been well served, and well enjoyed--
      Of course I mean in reason.And then a game of merry sort
      My _second_ made full many do;
    One player, nimbler than the rest,
      Caught sometimes one and sometimes two.She was a merry, laughing wench,
      And to the sport gave life and soul;
    Though maiden dames, and older folk,
      Declared her manners were my _whole_."It's a vane thing to
aspire."Give the positive, comparative, and superlative degrees of the

    the other turns his quartz into gold?When it's (s)ticking there.Miss Holme tells of some of her experiences with her leader:--

      ‘KRAGUJEVATZ.Elsie Inglis took me out shopping with her, and we
 wanted a great many things for our hospital in the way of drugs, etc.,
 and we also wanted more than anything else some medical scales for
 weighing drugs.Inglis saw hanging up
 in it three pairs of these scales.So she asked the man, in her most
 persuasive manner, if he would sell her a pair of these scales for our
 hospital use.He explained at length that he used all the scales, and
 was sorry that he could not possibly sell them.Inglis bought
 some more things--in fact, we stayed in the shop for about an hour
 buying things to the amount of £10, and between each of the different
 articles purchased, she would again revert to the scales and say,
 “You know it is for _your_ men that we want them,” until at last the
 man--exhausted by his refusals--took down the scales and presented
 them to her.When she asked “How much are they?” he made a bow, and
 said it would be a pleasure to give them to her.‘When we were taken prisoners, and had been so for some time, and
 before we were liberated, the German Command came bringing a paper
 which they commanded Dr.The purport of the paper was
 a statement which declared that the British prisoners had been well
 treated in the hands of the Germans, and was already signed by two men
 who were heads of other British units.Inglis said, “Why should
 I sign this paper?I do not know if all the prisoners are being well
 treated by you, therefore I decline to sign it.” To which the German
 authorities replied, “You must sign it.” Dr.Inglis then said, “Well,
 make me,” and that was the end of that incident--she never did sign it.‘So convinced were some of the people belonging to the Scottish
 Women’s unit that the British forces were coming to the aid of their
 Serbian ally, that long after they were taken prisoners they thought,
 each time they heard a gun from a different quarter, that their
 liberators were close at hand.So much so indeed, that three of the
 members of the unit begged that in the event of the unit being sent
 home they might be allowed to stay behind in Serbia with the Serbs,
 to help the Serbian Red Cross.Inglis _unofficially_ consented to
 this, and with the help of the Serbian Red Cross these three people in
 question adjourned to a village hard by which was about a mile from
 the hospital, three days before the unit had orders to move.Inglis and three other people of the unit knew where these
 three members were living.However, the date of the departure was
 changed, and the unit was told they were to wait another twenty days.This made it impossible for these three people to appear again with
 the unit.They continued to live at the little house which sheltered
 them.Suddenly one afternoon one of the members of the unit went to
 ask at the German Command if there were any letters for the unit.At
 this interview, which took place about three o’clock in the afternoon,
 the person was informed that the whole unit was to leave that night
 at 7.30.Inglis sent the person who received this command to tell
 the three people in the cottage to get ready, and that they must go,
 she thought.But the messenger only said, “We have had orders that the
 unit is to go at 7.30 to-night,” but did not say that Dr.Inglis had
 sent an order for the three people to get ready, so they did nothing
 but simply went to bed at ten o’clock, thinking the unit had already
 started.It was a wintry night, snowing heavily, and not a night that
 one would have sent out a dog!‘At about half-past ten a knock came to the window, and Dr.Inglis’
 voice was heard saying, “You have to come at once to the train.I
 am here with an armed guard!” (All the rest of the unit had been at
 the station for some hours, but the train was not allowed to start
 until every one was there.)It was
 difficult to get her to enter the house, and naturally she seemed
 rather ruffled, having had to come more than a mile in the deep snow,
 as she was the only person who knew anything about us.One of the
 party said, “Are you really cross, or are you pretending because the
 armed guard understands English?” She gave her queer little smile, and
 said, “No, I am not pretending.” The whole party tramped through the
 snow to the station, and on the way she told them she was afraid that
 she had smashed somebody’s window, having knocked at another cottage
 before she found ours in the dark, thinking it was the one we lived
 in, for which she was very much chaffed by her companions, who knew
 well her views on the question of militant tactics!‘The first stages of this journey were made in horse-boxes with no
 accommodation whatsoever.Occasionally the train drew up in the middle
 of the country, and anybody who wished to get out had simply to ask
 the sentry who guarded the door, to allow them to get out for a moment.‘The next night was spent lying on the floor of the station at
 Belgrade, the eight sentries and all their charges all lying on the
 floor together; the only person who seemed to be awake was the officer
 who guarded the door himself all night.In the morning one was not
 allowed to go even to wash one’s hands without a sentry to come and
 stand at the door.The next two days were spent in an ordinary train
 rather too well heated with four a side in second-class compartments.At Vienna all the British units who were being sent away were formed
 into a group on the station at 6 A.M., where they awaited the arrival
 of the American Consul, guarded all the time by their sentries, who
 gave his parole that if the people were allowed to go out of the
 station they would return at eight o’clock, the time they had to leave
 that town.Inglis with a party adjourned to a
 hotel where baths, etc., were provided.Other members were allowed to
 do what they liked.‘The unit was detained for eight days at Bludenz, close to the
 frontier, for Switzerland.On their arrival at Zürich they were met
 by the British Consul-General, Vice-Consul, and many members of the
 British Colony, who gave Dr.Inglis and her unit a very warm-hearted
 welcome, bringing quantities of flowers, and doing all they could to
 show them kindness and pleasure at their safe arrival.‘It is difficult for people who have never been prisoners to know what
 the first day’s freedom means.Everybody had a different expression,
 and seemed to have a different outlook on life.But already we could
 see our leader was engrossed with plans and busy with schemes for the
 future work of the unit.‘The next day the Consul-General made a speech in which he told the
 unit all that had passed during the last four months, of which they
 knew nothing.’

_To her Sister._

      ‘BRINDISI, _en route_ for SERBIA,
      ‘_April 28, 1915_.‘The boat ought to have left last night, but it did not even come in
 till this morning.However, we have only lost twenty-four hours.‘It has been a most luxurious journey, except the bit from Naples
 here, and that was rather awful, with spitting men and shut windows,
 in first-class carriages, remember.When we got here we immediately
 ordered baths, but “the boiler was broken.” So, I said, “Well, then,
 we must go somewhere else”--with the result that we were promised
 baths in our rooms at once.That was a nice bath, and then I curled
 up on the sofa and went to sleep.Our windows look right on to the
 docks, and the blue Mediterranean beyond.It is so queer to see the
 red, white, and green flags, and to think they mean Italy, and not the
 N.U.W.S.S.!‘I went out before dinner last night, and strolled through the quaint
 streets.The whole population was out, and most whole-hearted and
 openly interested in my uniform.‘This is a most delightful window, with all the ships and the colours.There are three men-of-war in, and half a dozen of the quaintest
 little boats, which a soldier told me were “scouts.” I wished I had
 asked a sailor, for I had never heard of “scouts.” The soldier I asked
 is one of the bersaglieri with cock’s feathers, a huge mass of them,
 in his hat.They all say Italy is certainly coming into the war.One
 man on the train to Rome was coming from Cardiff to sell coal to the
 Italian Government.He told us weird stories about German tricks to
 get our coal through Spain and other countries.‘It was a pleasure seeing Royaumont.It is a _huge_ success, and I do
 think Dr.The wards and the theatre,
 and the X-Ray department, and the rooms for mending and cleaning the
 men’s clothes were all perfect.’

_To Mrs.Simson._

      ‘S.W.H., KRAGUJEVATZ,
      _May 30/15_.‘Well, this is a perfectly lovely place, and the Serbians are
 delightful.I am staying with a charming woman, Madame Milanovitz.She
 is a Vice-President of the Serbian Women’s League, formed to help the
 country in time of war.I think she wanted to help us because of all
 the hospital has done here.Any how, _I_ score--I have a beautiful
 room and everything.She gives me an early cup of coffee, and for the
 rest I live with the unit.Neither she nor I can speak six words of
 one another’s languages, but her husband can talk a little French.Now, she has asked the little Serbian lady who teaches the unit
 Serbian, to live with her to interpret.‘We have had a busy time since we arrived.The unit is nursing 550
 beds, in three hospitals, having been sent out to nurse 300 beds.There is first the surgical hospital, called Reserve No.It was a
 school, and is in two blocks with a long courtyard between.I think
 we have got it really quite well equipped, with a fine X-Ray room.The theatre, and the room opposite where the dressings are done, both
 very well arranged, and a great credit to Sister Bozket.The one thing
 that troubled me was the floor--old wood and holes in it, impossible
 to sterilise--but yesterday, Major Protitch, our Director, said he was
 going to get cement laid down in it and the theatre.Chesney, “This is the best surgical hospital
 in Serbia.” You must not believe that _quite_, for they are very good
 at saying pleasant things here!‘There are two other hospitals, the typhus one, No.6 Reserve, and
 one for relapsing fever and general diseases, No.We have put most of our strength in No.6, and it is in
 good working order, but No.7 has had only one doctor, and two day
 Sisters and one night, for over 200 beds.Still it is wonderful what
 those three women have done.We have Austrian prisoners as orderlies
 everywhere, in the hospitals and in the houses.The conglomeration of
 languages is too funny for words--Serbian, German, French, English.Sometimes, you have to get an orderly to translate Serbian into
 German, and another to translate the German into French before you can
 get at what is wanted.Two words we have all learnt, _dotra_, which
 means “good,” and which these grateful people use at once if they
 feel a little better, or are pleased about anything, and the other is
 _boli_, pain--poor men!‘So much for what we _have_ been doing; but the day before
 yesterday we got our orders for a new bit of work.They are forming a
 disinfecting centre at Mladanovatz, and Colonel Grustitch, who is the
 head of the Medical Service here, wants us to go up there at once,
 with our whole fever staff, under canvas.They are giving us the tents
 till ours come out.Typhus is decreasing so much, that No.6 is to be
 turned into a surgical hospital, and there will be only one infectious
 diseases hospital here.I am so pleased at being asked to do this,
 for it is part of a big and well thought out scheme.Alice Hutchison goes to Posheravatz also
 for infectious diseases.I hope she is at Salonika to-day.We really began to think the Governor was going to
 keep her altogether!Her equipment has all come, and yesterday I sent
 Mrs.Smith up to Posheravatz to choose the site and
 pitch the tent.‘They gave me an awfully exciting bit of news in Colonel G.’s office
 yesterday, and that was that five motor cars were in Serbia, north of
 Mladanovatz, for _me_.Of course, I had wired for six, but you have
 been prompt about them.How they got into the north of Serbia I cannot
 imagine, unless they were dropped out of aeroplanes.‘Really, it is wonderful the work this unit has done in the most awful
 stress all through March and April.We ought to be awfully proud of
 them.Soltau a decoration, and Patsy
 Hunter had two medals._To her Niece, Amy M‘Laren._

      ‘VALJEVO, _August 16, 1915_.‘DARLING AMY,--I wonder if you could find this place on the map.I have spelt it properly, but if you want to say it you must say
 _Valuvo_.One of the hospitals mother has been collecting so much
 money for is here.It is in tents,
 on a bit of sloping ground looking south.There are big tents for
 the patients, and little tents for the staff.I pull my bed out
 of the tent every night, and sleep outside under the stars.Such
 lovely starlight nights we have here.Alice Hutchison is head of
 this unit, and I am here on a visit to her.My own hospital is in
 a town--Kragujevatz.Now, I wonder if you can find that place?The
 hospital there is in a girls’ school.Now--I wonder what will happen
 to the lessons of all those little girls as long as the war lasts?Serbia has been at war for three years, four wars in three years, and
 the women of the country have kept the agriculture of the country
 going all that time.A Serbian officer told me the other day that
 the country is so grateful to them, that they are going to strike a
 special medal for the women to show their thanks, when this war is
 over.This is such a beautiful country, and such nice people.Some day
 when the war is over, we’ll come here, and have a holiday.How are you
 getting on, my precious?God bless you,
 dear little girlie.--Ever your loving Aunt

      ELSIE.’

As the fever died out, a worse enemy came in.Serbia was overrun by
the Austro-German forces, and she, with others of her units, was taken
prisoner, as they had decided it was their duty to remain at their work
among the sick and wounded.Again the Serbian Minister is quoted:--

 ‘When the typhus calamity was overcome, the Scottish women reorganised
 themselves as tent hospitals and offered to go as near as possible
 to the army at the front.Their camp in the town of Valjevo--which
 suffered most of all from the Austrian invasion--might have stood
 in the middle of England.In Lazarevatz, shortly before the new
 Austro-German offensive, they formed a surgical hospital almost out
 of nothing, in the devastated shops and the village inns, and they
 accomplished the nursing of hundreds of wounded who poured in from
 the battle-field.When it became obvious that the Serbian army could
 not resist the combined Austrians, Germans, Magyars, and Bulgarians,
 who were about four times their numbers, the main care of the Serbian
 military authorities was what to do with the hospitals full of
 wounded, and whom to leave with the wounded soldiers, who refused to
 be left to fall into the hands of the cruel enemy.Then the Scottish
 women declared that they were not going to leave their patients, and
 that they would stay with them, whatever the conditions, and whatever
 might be expected from the enemy.They remained with the Serbian
 wounded as long as they could be of use to them.Simson._

      ‘KRUSHIEEVATZ, _Nov.‘We are in the very centre of the storm, and it just feels exactly
 like having the rain pouring down, and the wind beating in gusts, and
 not being able to see for the water in one’s eyes, and just holding on
 and saying, “It cannot last, it is so bad.” These poor little people,
 you cannot imagine anything more miserable than they are.Remember,
 they have been fighting for years for their independence, and now it
 all seems to end.Germans, Austrians,
 Bulgars, and all that is left is this western Morava Valley, and
 the country a little south of it.And their big Allies--from here
 it looks as if they are never going to move.I went into Craijuvo
 yesterday, in the car, to see about Dr.The road
 was crowded with refugees pouring away, all their goods piled on
 their rickety ox-wagons, little children on the top, and then bands
 of soldiers, stragglers from the army.These men were forming up
 again, as we passed back later on.We decided we must stand by our hospitals; it was too awful
 leaving badly wounded men with no proper care.Sir Ralph eventually
 agreed, and we gave everybody in the units the choice of going or
 staying.We have about 115 people in the Scottish unit, and twenty
 have gone.Smith brings up the rear-guard to-day, with one or two
 laggards and a wounded English soldier we have had charge of.MacGregor has trekked for Novi Bazaar.It is
 the starting-place for Montenegro.We all managed wonderfully in our
 first “evacuations,” and saved practically everything, but now it is
 hopeless.The bridges are down, and the trucks standing anyhow on
 sidings, and, worst of all, the people have begun looting.There’ll be famine, as well as cold, in this corner of the
 world soon, and then the distant prospect of 150,000 British troops at
 Salonika won’t help much.‘The beloved British troops,--the thought of them always cheers.But
 not the thought of the idiots at the top who had not enough gumption
 to _know_ this must happen.Anybody, even us women, could have told
 them that the Germans must try and break through to the help of the
 Turks.‘We have got a nice building here for a hospital, and Dr.Holloway
 is helping in the military hospital.I believe there are about 1000
 wounded in the place.I can’t write a very interesting letter, Amy
 dear, because at the bottom of my heart I don’t believe it will ever
 reach you.I don’t see them managing the Montenegrin passes at this
 time of year!There is a persistent rumour that the French have
 retaken Skopiro, and if that is true perhaps the Salonika route will
 be open soon.‘Some day, I’ll tell you all the exciting things that have been
 happening, and all the funny things too!For there have been funny
 things, in the middle of all the sadness.The guns are booming away,
 and the country looking so lovely in the sunlight.I wonder if Serbia
 is a particularly beautiful country, or whether it looks so lovely
 because of the tragedy of this war, just as bed seems particularly
 delightful when the night bell goes!’

      ‘SERBIAN MILITARY HOSPITAL,
      ‘KRUSHIEEVATZ, _Nov.‘We have been here about a month.It was dreadfully sad work leaving
 our beautiful little hospital at Krushieevatz.Here, we are working in
 the Serbian military hospital, and living in it also.You can imagine
 that we have plenty to do, when you hear we have 900 wounded.The
 prisoners are brought in every day, sometimes thousands, and go on to
 the north, leaving the sick.The Director has put the sanitation and
 the laundry into our hands also.‘We have had a hard frost for four days now, and snowstorms.My
 warm things did not arrive--I suppose they are safe at Salonika.Fortunately last year’s uniform was still in existence, and I wear
 three pairs of stockings, with my high boots.We have all cut our
 skirts short, for Serbian mud is awful.It is a lovely land, and the
 views round here are very cheering.One sunset I shall never forget--a
 glorious sky, and the hills deep blue against it.In the foreground
 the camp fires, and the prisoners round them in the fading light.’

With the invasion came the question of evacuation.At one time it was
possible the whole of the British unit might escape _via_ Montenegro.Sir Ralph Paget, realising that the equipment could not be saved,
allowed any of the hospital unit who wished to remain with their
wounded.Two parties went with the retreating Serbs, and their story
and the extraordinary hardships they endured has been told elsewhere.Those left at Krushieevatz were in Dr.Inglis’ opinion the fortunate
units.For three months they tended the Serbian wounded under foreign
occupation.Inglis kept to their work, and when
necessary confronted the Austro-German officers with all the audacity
of their leader and the Scottish thistle combined.When we went up
there were 900 patients.During the greatest part of the pressure the
number rose to 1200.Patients were placed in the corridors--at first
one man to one bed, but later two beds together, and three men in them.Then there were no more bedsteads, and mattresses were placed on the
floor.The magazine in full blast was a
sight, once seen, never to be forgotten.There were three tiers,
the slightly wounded men in the highest tier.Inglis says the time to see the place at its
best or its worst was in the gloaming, when two or three feeble oil
lamps illuminated the gloom, and the tin bowls clattered and rattled as
the evening ration of beans was given out, and the men swarmed up and
down the poles of their shelves chattering as Serbs will chatter.The
Sisters called the place ‘the Zoo.’

The dread of the renewal of the typhus scourge, amid such conditions
of overcrowding, underfeeding, fatigue and depression, was great.Inglis details the appalling tasks the unit undertook in sanitation.There was no expert amongst them:--

 ‘When we arrived, the hospital compound was a truly terrible
 place--the sights and smells beyond description.We dug the rubbish
 into the ground, emptied the overflowing cesspool, built incinerators,
 and cleaned, and cleaned, and cleaned.That is an Englishman’s job all
 over the world.Our three untrained English girl orderlies took to it
 like ducks to water.It was not the pleasantest or easiest work in the
 world; but they did it, and did it magnificently.‘Laundry and bathing arrangements were installed and kept going.We
 had not a single case of typhus; we had a greater achievement than
 its prevention.Late of an evening, when men among the prisoners were
 put into the wards, straight from the march, unwashed and crawling
 with lice, there was great indignation among the patients already in.“Doktoritza,” they said, “if you put these dirty men in among us we
 shall all get typhus.” Our hearts rejoiced.If we have done nothing
 else, we thought, we have driven that fact home to the Serbian mind
 that dirt and typhus go together.’

Dr.Inglis describes the misery of the Serbian prisoners:--

 ‘They had seen men go out to battle, conscious of the good work they
 had done for the Allies in driving back the Austrians in their first
 punitive expedition.We are the only ones who, so far, have beaten
 our enemy.They came back to us broken and dispirited.They were
 turned into the hospital grounds, with a scanty ration of beans, with
 a little meat and half a loaf of bread for twenty-four hours.Their
 camp fires flickered fitfully through the long bitter cold nights.Every scrap of wood was torn up, the foot bridges over the drains, and
 the trees hacked down for firewood.We added to the rations of our
 sanitary workers, we gave away all the bread we could, but we could
 not feed that enclosure of hungry men.We used to hear them coughing
 and moaning all night.’

Dr.Inglis details the starving condition of the whole country, the
weakness of the famine-stricken men who worked for them, the starved
yoke oxen, and all the manifold miseries of a country overrun by the
enemy.‘There was,’ she says, ‘a curious exhilaration in working for those
 grateful patient men, and in helping the director, Major Nicolitch, so
 loyal to his country and so conscientious in his work, to bring order
 out of chaos, and yet the unhappiness in the Serbian houses, and the
 physical wretchedness of those cold hungry prisoners lay always like
 a dead weight on our spirit.Never shall we forget the beauty of the
 sunrises, or the glory of the sunsets, with clear, cold sunlit days
 between, and the wonderful starlit nights.But we shall never forget
 “the Zoo” either, or the groans outside the windows when we hid our
 heads under the blankets to shut out the sound.The unit got no news,
 and they made it a point of honour to believe nothing said in the
 German telegrams.We could not believe Serbia had been sacrificed for
 nothing.We were convinced it was some deep laid scheme for weakening
 other fronts, and so it was natural to believe rumours, such as that
 the English had taken Belgium, and the French were in Metz.‘The end of the five months of service in captivity, and to captive
 Serbs ended.On the 11th February 1916, they were sent north under an
 Austrian guard with fixed bayonets, thus to Vienna, and so by slow
 stages they came to Zürich.‘It was a great thing to be once more “home” and to realise how strong
 and straight and fearless a people inhabit these islands: to realise
 not so much that they mean to win the war, but rather that they
 consider any other issue impossible.’

So Dr.Inglis came back to plan new campaigns for the help of the
Serbian people, who lay night and day upon her heart.She knew she had
the backing of the Suffrage societies, and she intended to get the
ear of the English public for the cause of the Allies in the Balkans.‘We,’ who had sent her out, found her changed in many ways.Physically
she had altered much, and if we could ever have thought of the body
in the presence of that dauntless spirit, we might have seen that the
Angel of Shadows was not far away.The privations and sufferings she
described so well when she had to speak of her beloved Serbs had been
fully shared by the unit.Their comfort was always her thought; she
never would have anything that could not be shared and shared alike,
but there was little but hardship to share, and one and all scorned to
speak of privations which were a light affliction compared to those
of a whole nation groaning and waiting to be redeemed from its great
tribulation.There was a look in her face of one whose spirit had been pierced by
the sword.The brightness of her eyes was dimmed, for she had seen the
days when His judgments were abroad upon the earth:--

    ‘Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
    He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are
        stored;
    He has loosed the fatal lightning of His terrible swift sword:
    I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
    They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
    I have read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.’

She could never forget the tragedy of Serbia, and she came home, not
to rest, but vowed to yet greater endeavours for their welfare.The
attitude of the Allies she did not pretend to understand.She had
something of the spirit of Oliver Cromwell, when he threatened to
send his fleet across the Alps to help the Waldensians.In her public
speeches, when she set forth what in her outlook could have been done,
no censor cut out the sentences which were touched by the live coals
from off her altar of service.Elsie never recognised the word
‘impossible’ for herself, and for her work that was well.As to her
political and military outlook, the story of the nations will find it a
place in the history of the war.For a few months she worked from the bases of her two loyal
Committees in London and Edinburgh.She spoke at many a public meeting,
and filled many a drawing-room.The Church of Scotland knew her
presence in London.‘One of our most treasured memories will be that
keen, clever face of hers in St.Columba’s of a Sunday--with the far,
wistful melancholy in it, added to its firm determination.’ So writes
the minister.‘We’ knew what lay behind the wistful brave eyes, a yet
more complete dedication to the service of her Serbian brethren.CHAPTER X

RUSSIA

1917

    ‘Even so in our mortal journey,
      The bitter north winds blow,
    And thus upon life’s red river,
      Our hearts as oarsmen row.And when the Angel of Shadow
      Rests his feet on wave and shore,
    And our eyes grow dim with watching,
      And our hearts faint at the oar,

    Happy is he who heareth
      The signal of his release
    In the bells of the holy city
      The chimes of eternal peace.’


Dr.Inglis’ return to England was the signal for renewed efforts
on the part of the Committees managing the S.W.H.This memoir has
necessarily to follow the personality of the leader, but it must never
be forgotten that her strength and all her sinews of war lay in the
work of those who carried on at home, week by week.Strong committees
of women, ably organised and thoroughly staffed, took over the burden
of finance--a matter Dr.Inglis once amusingly said, ‘did not interest
her.’ They found and selected the _personnel_ on which success so much
depended, they contracted for and supervised the sending out of immense
consignments of equipment and motor transport.They dealt with the
Government department, and in loyal devotion smoothed every possible
obstacle out of the path of those flying squadrons, the units of the
S.W.H.It was inevitable the quick brain and tenacious energy of Dr.Inglis,
far away from the base of her operations, should at times have found
it hard to understand why the wheels occasionally seemed to drag, and
the new effort she desired to make did not move at the pace which to
her eager spirit seemed possible.Two enterprises filled her mind on
her return in 1916.One, by the help of the London Committee, she put
through.This was the celebration of Kossovo Day in Great Britain.The flag-day of the Serbian Patriot King was under her chairmanship
prepared for in six weeks.Hundreds of lectures on the history of
Serbia were arranged for and delivered throughout the country, and no
one failed to do her work, however remote they might think the prospect
of making the British people interested in a country and patriot so far
from the ken of their island isolation.Kossovo Day was a success, and through the rush of the work Dr.Inglis
was planning the last and most arduous of all the undertakings of the
S.W.H., that of the unit which was to serve with the Serbian Volunteers
on the Rumanian Russian front.Inglis knew from private sources the
lack of hospital arrangements in Mesopotamia, and she, with the backing
of the Committees, had approached the authorities for leave to take a
fully equipped unit to Basra.When the story of the Scottish Women’s
Hospital is written, the correspondence between the War Office, the
Foreign Office, and S.W.H.will throw a tragic light on this lamentable
episode, and, read with the report of the Committees, it will prove how
quick and foreseeing of trouble was her outlook.Inglis
brought her units back from Serbia, she again urged the War Office to
send her out.Of her treatment by the War Office, Mrs.Sandra went back to the kitchen.Fawcett writes:
‘She was not only refused, but refused with contumely and insult.’

True to her instinct never to pause over a set-back, she lost no time
in pressing on her last enterprise for the Serbians.M. Curcin, in _The
Englishwoman_, says:--

 ‘She was already acquainted with one side of the Serbian
 problem--Serbia; she was told that in Russia there was the best
 opportunity to learn about the second half--the Serbs of Austria, the
 Jugoslavs.Inglis succeeded in raising a hospital
 unit and transport section staffed by eighty women heroes of the
 Scottish Women’s Hospitals to start with her on a most adventurous
 undertaking, _via_ Archangel, through Russia to Odessa and the
 Dobrudja.Inglis succeeded also--most difficult of all--in
 getting permission from the British authorities for the journey.Eye-witnesses--officers and soldiers--tell everybody to-day how those
 women descended, practically straight from the railway carriages,
 after forty days’ travelling, beside the stretchers with wounded,
 and helped to dress the wounds of those who had had to defend the
 centre and also a wing of the retreating army.For fifteen months she
 remained with those men, whose _rôle_ is not yet fully realised, but
 is certain to become one of the most wonderful and characteristic
 facts of the conflagration of nations.’

The Edinburgh Committee had already so many undertakings on behalf of
the S.W.H.that they gladly allowed the Committee formed by the London
Branch of the N.U.W.S.S.to undertake the whole work of organising this
last adventure for the Serbian Army.Inglis and her unit sailed the wintry main, and to them she sent
the voluminous and brilliant reports of her work.When the Russian
revolution imperilled the safety of the Serbian Army on the Rumanian
front, she sent home members of her unit, charged with important
verbal messages to her Government.Through the last anxious month,
when communications were cut off, short messages, unmistakably her
own, came back to the London Committee, that they might order her to
return.She would come with the Serbian Army and not without them.We
at home had to rest on the assurances of the Foreign Office, always
alive to the care and encouragement of the S.W.H., that Dr.Inglis and
her unit were safe, and that their return would be expedited at the
safest hour.In those assurances we learnt to rest, and the British
Government did not fail that allied force--the Serbian Army and the
Scottish women serving them.The following letters were those written
to her family with notes from her graphic report to her Committees.The
clear style and beautiful handwriting never changed even in those last
days, when those who were with her knew that nothing but the spirit
kept the wasted body at its work.‘The Serbian Division is superb; we
are proud to be attached to it.’ These were the last words in her last
letter from Odessa in June 1917.That pride of service runs through
all the correspondence.The spirit she inspired is noteworthy in a
book which covers the greater part of these fifteen months, _With the
Scottish Nurses in Rumania_, by Yvonne Fitzroy.In a daily diary a
searchlight is allowed to fall on some of the experiences borne with
such high-hearted nonchalance by the leader and her gallant disciples.Haverfield, who saw her work, writes:

 ‘It was perfectly incredible that one human being could do the work
 she accomplished.Her record piece of work perhaps was at Galatz,
 Rumania, at the end of the retreat.There were masses and masses of
 wounded, and she and her doctors and nurses performed operations and
 dressings for fifty-eight hours out of sixty-three.Scott, of the
 armoured cars, noted the time, and when he told her how long she had
 been working, she simply said, “Well, it was all due to Mrs.Milne,
 the cook, who kept us supplied with hot soup.” She had been very
 tired for a long time; undoubtedly the lack of food, the necessity of
 sleeping on the floor, and nursing her patients all the time told on
 her health.In Russia she was getting gradually more tired until she
 became ill.When she was the least bit better she was up again, and
 all the time she attended to the business of the unit.‘Just before getting home she had a relapse, and the last two or
 three days on board ship, we know now, she was dying.She made all the
 arrangements for the unit which she brought with her, however, and
 interviewed every member of it.To Miss Onslow, her transport officer,
 she said, when she arrived at Newcastle, “I shall be up in London in a
 few days’ time, and we will talk the matter of a new unit over.” Miss
 Onslow turned away with tears in her eyes.’

      ‘H.M.TRANSPORT ----,
      ‘_Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--Here we are more than half way through our voyage.We
 got off eventually on Wednesday night, and lay all Thursday in the
 river.You never in your life saw such a filthy boat as this was when
 we came on board.The captain had been taken off an American liner the
 day before.The only officer who had been on this boat before was the
 engineer officer.The crew were drunk to a man,
 and, as the Transport officer said, “The only way to get this ship
 right, is to get her _out_.” So we got out.I must say we got into
 shape very quickly.We cleaned up, and now we are painting.They won’t
 know her when she gets back.She is an Austrian Lloyd captured at the
 beginning of the war, and she has been trooping in the Mediterranean
 since.She was up at Glasgow for this new start, but she struck the
 Glasgow Fair, and could therefore get nothing done, so she was brought
 down to the port we started from--as she was.The captain seems to be an awfully good man.He is Scotch,
 and was on the Anchor Line to Bombay.She has all our equipment, fourteen of our cars.For passengers,
 there are ourselves, seventy-five people, and three Serbian officers,
 and the mother and sister of one of them, and thirty-two Serbian
 non-commissioned officers.On the saloon deck there are
 twenty-two very small, single cabins.And on this deck larger cabins
 with either three or four berths.I am on this deck in the most
 luxurious quarters.It is called _The Commanding Officer’s Cabin_
 (ahem).There is a huge cabin with one berth; off it on one side
 another cabin with a writing-table and sofa, and off it on the other
 side a bathroom and dressing-room!Of course, if we had had rough
 weather, and the ports had had to be closed, it would not have been so
 nice, especially as the glass in all the portholes is blackened, but
 we have had perfectly glorious weather.At night every porthole and
 window is closed to shut in the light, but the whole ship is very well
 ventilated.A good many of them sleep up in the boats, or in one of
 the lorries.‘We sighted one submarine, but it took no notice of us, so we took
 no notice of it.We had all our boats allotted to us the very first
 day.We divided the unit among them, putting one responsible person
 in charge of each, and had boat drill several times.Then one day the
 captain sounded the alarm for practice, and everybody was at their
 station in three minutes in greatcoat and life-belt.The amusing
 thing was that some of them thought it was a real alarm, and were
 most annoyed and disappointed to find there was not a submarine
 really there!The unit as a whole seems very nice and capable, though
 there are one or two queer characters!But most of them are healthy,
 wholesome bricks of girls.Of course
 a field hospital is quite a new bit of work.‘We reach our port of disembarkation this afternoon.The voyage
 has been a most pleasant one in every way.As soon as sea-sickness
 was over the unit developed a tremendous amount of energy, and we
 have had games on deck, and concerts, and sports, and a fancy dress
 competition!All this in addition to drill every morning, which was
 compulsory.‘We began the day at 8.30--breakfast, the cabins were tidied.9.30--roll call and cabin inspection immediately after; then
 drill--ordinary drill, stretcher drill, and Swedish drill in sections.Lunch was at 12.30, and then there were lessons in Russian, Serbian,
 and French, to which they could go if they liked, and most of them
 took one, or even two, and lectures on motor construction, etc.Tea at
 4, and dinner 6.30.You would have thought there was not much time for
 anything else, but the superfluous energy of a British unit manages
 to put a good deal more in.(The head of a British unit in Serbia
 once said to me that the chief duty of the head of a British unit was
 to use up the superfluous energy of the unit in harmless ways.He
 said that the only time there was no superfluous energy was when the
 unit was overworking.That was the time I found that particular unit
 playing rounders!)I was standing next
 to a Serb officer during the obstacle race, and he suddenly turned to
 me and said, “C’est tout-à-fait nouveau pour nous, Madame.” I thought
 it must be, for at that moment they were getting under a sail which
 had been tied down to the deck--two of them hurled themselves on the
 sail and dived under it, you saw four legs kicking wildly, and then
 the sail heaved and fell, and two dishevelled creatures emerged at the
 other side, and tore at two life-belts which they went through, and so
 on.I should think it was indeed _tout-à-fait nouveau_.Some of the
 dresses at the fancy dress competition were most clever.There was
 Napoleon--the last phase, in the captain’s long coat and somebody’s
 epaulettes, and one of our grey hats, side to the front, excellent;
 and Tweedledum and Tweedledee, in saucepans and life-belts.One of
 them got herself up as a “greaser,” and went down to the engine-room
 to get properly dirty, with such successful result that, when she was
 coming up to the saloon, with her little oiling can in her hand, one
 of the officers stopped her with, “Now, where are you going to, my
 lad?”

 ‘We ended up with all the allied National Anthems, the Serbs leading
 their own.‘I do love to see them enjoying themselves, and to hear them
 chattering and laughing along the passages, for they’ll have plenty
 of hard work later.We had service on Sunday, which I took, as
 the captain could not come down.Could you get us some copies of
 the Archbishop of Canterbury’s war prayers?The captain declares he was snap-shotted six times
 one morning.I don’t know if the Russian Government will let us take
 all these cameras with us.We are flying the Union Jack for the first
 time to-day since we came out.It is good to know you are all thinking
 of us.--Ever your loving sister,

      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

      ‘ON THE TRAIN TO MOSCOW,
      ‘_Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--Here we are well on our way to Moscow, having got
 through Archangel in 2½ days--a feat, for we were told at home that it
 might be six weeks.They did not know that there is a party of our
 naval men there helping the Russians, and Archangel is magnificently
 organised now.‘When one realises that the population was 5000 before the war,
 and is now 20,000, it is quite clear there was bound to be some
 disorganisation at first.‘I never met a kinder set of people than are collected at Archangel
 just now.They simply did everything for us, and sent us off in a
 train with a berth for each person, and gave us a wonderful send off.The Russian Admiral gave us a letter which acts as a kind of magic
 ring whenever it is produced.The first time it was really quite
 startling.We were longing for Nyamdonia where we were to get dinner.We were told we should be there at four o’clock, then at five, and
 at six o’clock we pulled up at a place unknown, and rumours began
 to spread that our engine was off, and sure enough it was, and was
 shunting trucks.Miss Little, one of our Russian-speaking people,
 and I got out.We tried our united eloquence, she in fluent Russian,
 and I saying, _Shechaz_, which means “immediately” at intervals, and
 still they looked helpless and said, “Two hours and a half.” Then I
 produced my letter, and you never saw such a change.They said, “Five
 minutes,” and we were off in three.We tried it all along the line
 after that; my own belief is that we should still be at the unknown
 place, without that letter, shunting trucks.At one station, Miss
 Little heard the station-master saying, “There is a great row going
 on here, and there will be trouble to-morrow if this train isn’t got
 through.” Eventually, we reached Nyamdonia at 11.30, and found a
 delightful Russian officer, and an excellent dinner paid for by the
 Russian Government, waiting for us.We all thought the food very good,
 and I thought the sauce of hunger helped.The next day, profiting
 over our Nyamdonia experience, I said meals were to be had at regular
 times from our stores in the train, and we should take the restaurants
 as we found them, with the result that we arrived at Vorega, where
 _déjeuner_ had been ordered just as we finished a solid lunch of ham
 and eggs.I said they had better go out and have two more courses,
 which they did with great content, and found it quite as nice as the
 night before.‘This is a special train for us and the Serbian officers and
 non-coms.We broke a coupling after we left Nyamdonia, and they sent
 out another carriage from there, but it had not top berths, so they
 had another sleeper ready when we reached Vologda.They gave us
 another and stronger engine at Nyamdonia, because we asked for it, and
 have repaired cisterns, and given us chickens and eggs; and when we
 thank them, they say, “It is for our friends.” The crowd stand round
 three deep while we eat, and watch us all the time, quite silently in
 the stations.In Archangel one old man asked, “Who, on God’s earth,
 are you?”

 ‘They gave us such a send-off from Archangel!Russian soldiers were
 drawn up between the ship and the train, and cheered us the whole way,
 with a regular British cheer; our own crew turned out with a drum
 and a fife and various other instruments, and marched about singing.Then they made speeches, and cheered everybody, and then suddenly the
 Russian soldiers seized the Serbian officers and tossed them up and
 down, up and down, till they were stopped by a whistle.But they had
 got into the mood by then, and they rushed at me.You can imagine, I
 fled, and seized hold of the British Consul.I did think the British
 Empire would stand by me, but he would do nothing but laugh.And I
 found myself up in the air above the crowd, up and down, quite safe,
 hands under one and round one.They were so happy that I waved my hand
 to them, and they shouted and cheered.The unit is only annoyed that
 they had not their cameras, and that anyhow it was dark.Then they
 tossed Captain Bevan, who is in command there, because he was English,
 and the Consul for the same reason, and the captain of the transport
 because he had brought us out.We sang all the national anthems, and
 then they danced for us.It was a weird sight in the moonlight.Some
 of the dances were like Indian ones, and some reminded me of our
 Highland flings.We went on till one in the morning--all the British
 colony, there.I confess, I was tired--though I did enjoy it.Captain
 Bevan’s good-bye was the nicest and so unexpected--simply “God bless
 you.” Mrs.Young, the Consul’s wife, Mrs.Kerr, both Russians, simply
 gave up their whole time to us, took the girls about, and Mrs.Kerr
 had _the whole unit_ to tea.I had lunch one day at the British Mess,
 and another day at the Russian Admiral’s.They all came out to dinner
 with us.‘Of course a new face means a lot in an out-of-the-way place, and
 seventy-five new faces was a God-send.Well, as I said before, they
 are the kindest set of people I ever came across.They brought us our
 bread, and changed our money, and arranged with the bank, and got us
 this train with berths, and thought of every single thing for us.‘NEARING ODESSA,
      ‘_Sep.‘DARLING EVE,--We are nearing the second stage of our journey, and
 _they say_ we shall be in Odessa to-night.We have all come to the
 conclusion that a Russian minute is about ten times as long as ours.If we get in to-night we shall have taken nine days from Archangel;
 with all the lines blocked with military trains, that is not bad.All the same we have had some struggles, but it has been a very
 comfortable journey and very pleasant.The Russian officials all along
 the line have been most helpful and kind.A Serbian officer on board,
 or rather a Montenegrin, looked after us like a father.‘What we should have done without M. and Mme.Malinina at Moscow, I
 don’t know.They gave the whole afternoon up to us: took us to the
 Kremlin--he, the whole unit on special tramcars, and she, three of
 us in her motor.She has a beautiful
 hospital, a clearing one at the station, and he is a member of the
 Duma, and Commandant of all the Red Cross work in Moscow.We only had
 a glimpse of the Kremlin, yet enough to make one want to see more.I
 carried away one beautiful picture to remember--the view of Moscow in
 the sunset light, simply gorgeous.‘The unit are very very well, and exceedingly cheerful.I am not
 sorry to have had these three weeks since we left to get the unit in
 hand.When M. Malinina said it was
 time to leave the Kremlin, and the order was given to “Fall in,” I was
 quite proud of them, they did it so quickly.It is wonderful even now
 what they manage to do.Miss H. says they are like eels in a basket.They were told not to eat fruit without peeling it, so one of them
 peeled an apple with her teeth.They were told not to drink unboiled
 water, so they handed their water-bottles out at dead of night to
 Russian soldiers, to whom they could not explain, to fill for them,
 as of course they understood they were not to fill them from water on
 the train.I must say they are an awfully nice lot on the whole.We
 certainly shall not fail for want of energy.The Russian crowds are
 tremendously interested in them.--Ever your loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

      ‘RENI, _Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--We have left Odessa and are really off to our
 Division.We were told this is the important point in the war
 just now--“A Second Verdun.” The great General Mackensen is in command
 against us.He was in command at Krushinjevatz when we were taken
 prisoners.Every one says how anxiously they are looking out for us,
 and, indeed, we shall have our work cut out for us.We are two little
 field hospitals for a whole Division.Think if that was the provision
 for our own men.We saw the
 2nd Division preparing in Odessa.Only from the point of view of the
 war, they ought to be looked after, but when one remembers that they
 are men, every one of them with somebody who cares for them, it is
 dreadful.I wish we were each six women instead of one.I have wired
 home for another Base Hospital to take the place of the British Red
 Cross units when they move on with the 2nd Division.The Russians are
 splendid in taking the Serbs into their Base Hospitals, but you can
 imagine what the pressure is from their own huge armies.We had such
 a reception at Odessa.All the Russian officials, at the station, and
 our Consul, and a line drawn up of twenty Serbian officers.They had
 a motor car and forty droskies and a squad of Serbian soldiers to
 carry up our personal luggage, and most delightful quarters for us on
 the outskirts of the town in a sanatorium.We were the guests of the
 city while we were there.Odessa
 is immensely interested in us.We were told that the form of greeting
 while we were there was, “Have you seen _them_?” The two best things
 were the evening at the Serbian Mess, and the gala performance at the
 opera.The cheering of the Serbian mess when we went in was something
 to remember, but I can tell you I felt quite choking when the whole
 house last night turned round and cheered us after we tried to sing
 our National Anthem to them with the orchestra.‘DEAREST AMY,--Just a line to say I am all right.Four weeks to-morrow
 since we reached Medgidia, and began our hospital.We evacuated it in
 three weeks, and here we are all back on the frontier.Such a time it
 has been, Amy dear.You cannot imagine what war is just behind the
 lines, and in a retreat!--our second retreat, and almost to the same
 day.We evacuated Kragujevatz on the 25th of October last year.We
 evacuated Medgidia on the 22nd this year.On the 25th this year, we
 were working in a Russian dressing-station at Harshova, and were moved
 on in the evening.We arrived at Braila to find 11,000 wounded, and
 seven doctors--only one of them a surgeon.Am going back to Braila to do surgery.Have
 sent every trained person there.--Your loving sister,

      ELSIE.‘_P.S._--We have had lots of exciting things too, and amusing things,
 and _good_ things.’

      ‘ON THE DANUBE AT TULCEA,
      ‘_Nov.‘DEAREST AMY,--I am writing this on the boat between Tulcea and
 Ismail, where I am going to see our second hospital and the transport.Admiral Vesolskin has given me a special boat, and we motored over
 from Braila.The Étappen command had been expecting us all afternoon,
 and the boat was ready.They were very amused to find that “the
 doctor” they had been expecting was a _woman_!‘Our main hospital was at Medgidia, and our field hospital at
 Bulbulmic, only about seven miles from the front.They gave us a
 very nice building, a barrack, at Medgidia for the hospital, and the
 _personnel_ were in tents on the opposite hill.We arrived on the
 day of the offensive, and were ready for patients within forty-eight
 hours.We were there less than three weeks, and during that time we
 unpacked the equipment and repacked it.We made really a rather nice
 hospital at Medgidia, and the field hospital.We pitched and struck
 the camp--we were nursing and operating the whole time, and evacuating
 rapidly too, and our cars were on the road practically always.‘The first notice we got of the retreat was our field hospital being
 brought back five versts.Then we were told to
 send the equipment to Galatz, but to keep essential things and the
 _personnel_.The whole country was covered with
 groups of soldiers who had lost their regiments.Russians, Serbs, and
 Rumanians.The Rumanian guns were simply being rushed back, through
 the crowds of refugees.The whole country was moving: in some places
 the panic was awful.One part of our scattered unit came in for it.You would have thought the Bulgars were at the heels of the people.One man threw away a baby right in front of the cars.They were
 throwing everything off the carts to lighten them, and our people,
 being of a calmer disposition, picked up what they wanted in the way
 of vegetables, etc.Men, with their rifles and bayonets, climbed on
 to the Red Cross cars to save a few minutes.We simply went head
 over heels out of the country.I want to collect all the different
 stories of our groups.My special lot slept the first night on straw
 in Caromacat; the next night on the roadside round a lovely fire; the
 next (much reduced in numbers, for I had cleared the majority off in
 barges for Galatz), we slept in an empty room at Hershova, and spent
 the next day dressing at the wharf.And by the next night we were in
 Braila, involved in the avalanche of wounded that descended on that
 place, and there we have been ever since.‘We found some of our transport, and, while we were having tea, an
 officer came in and asked us to go round and help in a hospital.There, we were told, there were 11,000 wounded (I believe the official
 figures are 7000).They had been working thirty-six hours without
 stopping when we arrived.‘The wounded had overflowed into empty houses, and were lying about in
 their uniforms, and their wounds not dressed for four or five days.‘So we just turned up our sleeves and went in.I got back all the
 trained Sisters from Galatz, and now the pressure is over.One thing
 I am going up to Ismail for, is to get into touch with the Serbian H.2, and find out what they want us to do next.The Serb wounded were
 evacuated straight to Odessa.‘The unit as a whole has behaved splendidly, plucky and cheery through
 everything, and game for any amount of work.‘And we are prouder of our Serbs than ever.I do hope the papers at
 home have realised what the 1st Division did, and how they suffered in
 the fight in the middle of September.General Genlikoffsky said to me,
 “_C’était magnifique, magnifique!Ils sont les héros_”;--and another
 Russian: “We did not quite believe in these Austrian Serbs, but no one
 will ever doubt them again.”

 ‘Personally, I have been awfully well, and prouder than ever of
 British women.I wish you could have seen trained Sisters scrubbing
 floors at Medgidia, and those strapping transport girls lifting the
 stretchers out of the ambulances so steadily and gently.I have told
 in the Report how Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown brought the equipments
 through to Galatz.We lost only one Ludgate boiler and one box of
 radiators.We lost two cars, but that was really the fault of a rather
 stupid Serbian officer.It is a comfort to feel you are all thinking
 of us.--Your loving sister,

      ‘E.I.’

      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN BETWEEN
      ‘RENI AND ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING EVE,--Now we have got a hospital at Reni again, for badly
 wounded, working in connection with the evacuation station.We have
 got the dearest little house to live in ourselves, but, as we are
 getting far more people out from Odessa, we shall have to overflow
 into the Expedition houses.I
 remember thinking Reni a most uninteresting place--crowds of shipping
 and the wharf all crammed with sacks.It was just a big junction like
 Crewe!‘The hospital at Reni is a real building, but it is not finished.One
 unfinished bit is the windows, which have one layer of glass each,
 though they have double sashes.When this was pointed out, I thought
 it was a mere continental foible.When the cold came I realised
 that there is some sense in this foible after all!We _cannot_ get
 the wards warm, notwithstanding extra stoves and roaring fires.The
 poor Russians do mind cold so much.But they don’t want to leave the
 hospital.One man whom I told he must have an operation later on in
 another hospital, said he would rather wait for it in ours.The first
 time we had to evacuate, we simply could not get the men to go.‘We have got a Russian Secretary now, because we are using Russian
 Red Cross money, and he told us he had been told in Petrograd that
 the S.W.H.were beautifully organised, and the only drawback was
 the language.We have got a
 certain number of Austrian prisoners as orderlies, and most of them
 curiously can speak Russian, so we get on better.This is a most comfortable
 way of travelling, and the quickest.We have 500 wounded on board,
 twenty-three of them ours.I am going to Odessa to find out why we
 cannot get Serb patients.There are still thousands of them in Odessa,
 and yet Dr.The Serbs we meet seem
 to think it is somehow our fault!I tell them I have written and
 telegraphed, and planned and made two journeys to Ismail, to try and
 get a real Serbian Hospital going, and yet it doesn’t go.‘What did happen over the change of Government?I do hope we have got
 the right lot now, to put things straight at home, and carry through
 things abroad.Remember it all depends on you people at home._The
 whole thing depends on us._ I know we lose the perspective in this
 gloomy corner, but there is one thing quite clear, and that is that
 they are all trusting to our _sticking_ powers.They know we’ll hold
 on--of course--I only wish we would realise that it would be as well
 to use our intellects too, and have them clear of alcohol.’

      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,
      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘You don’t know what a comfort it is on this tumultuous front, to
 know that all you people at home have just settled down to it, and
 that you’ll put things right in the long run.It is curious to feel
 how everybody is trusting to that.The day we left Braila, a Rumanian
 said to me in the hall, “It is England we are trusting to.She has
 got hold now like a strong dog!” But it is a bigger job than any of
 you imagine, _I_ think.But there is not the slightest doubt we shall
 pull it off.I am glad to think the country has discovered that it is
 possible to have an alternative Government.If it does not do, we must
 find yet another._To her little Niece, Amy M‘Laren_

      ‘ON AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,
      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING AMY,--How are you all?We have been very busy since we came
 out here: first a hospital for the Serbs at Medgidia, then in a
 Rumanian hospital at Braila, and then for the Russians at Galatz and
 Reni.In the very middle, by some funny mistake, we were sent flying
 right on to the front line.However we nipped out again just in time,
 and the station was burnt to the ground just half an hour after we
 left.I’ll tell you the name of the place when the war is over, and
 show it to you on the map.We saw the petrol tanks on fire as we came
 away, and the ricks of grain too.‘Our hospital at Galatz was in a school.I don’t think the children
 in these parts are doing many lessons during the war, and that will
 be a great handicap for their countries afterwards.Perhaps, however,
 they are learning other lessons.When we left the Dobrudja we saw the
 crowds of refugees on their carts, with the things they had been able
 to save, and all the little children packed in among the furniture and
 pots and pans and pigs.‘In one cart I saw two fascinating babies about three years old,
 sitting in a kind of little nest made of pillows and rugs.They were
 little girls, one fair and one dark, and they sat there, as good as
 gold, watching everything with such interest.There were streams of
 carts along the roads, and all the villages deserted.That is what
 the war means out here.It is not quite so bad in our safe Scotland,
 is it?--thanks to the fleet.And that is why it seems to me we have
 got to help these people, because they are having the worst of it.I wonder if you can knit socks yet, for I can use any number, and
 bandages.Blessings on you, precious
 little girl.--Your loving aunt,

      ELSIE.’

 ‘I have had my meals with the Staff.Unfortunately, most of them
 speak only Russian, but one man speaks French, and another German.The man who speaks German is
 having English lessons from her.He picked up _Punch_ and showed _me_ YOU.So, I said “you.”
 He repeated it quite nicely, and then found another OU.“Though,”
 and when I said “though,” he flung up his hands, and said, “Why a
 practical nation like the English should do things like this!”’

      ‘S.W.H.,
      RENI, _March 5, 1917_.‘DARLING MARY,--We have been having such icy weather here, such
 snowstorms sweeping across the plain.One day I really thought the house would be cut off from the hospital.The unit going over to Roll was quite a sight, with the indiarubber
 boots, and peaked Russian caps, with the ends twisted round their
 throats.We should have thoroughly enjoyed it if it had not been for
 the shortage of fuel.However, we were never absolutely without wood,
 and now have plenty, as a Cossack regiment sent a squad of men across
 the Danube to cut for us, and we brought it back in our carts.The
 Danube is frozen right across--such a curious sight.The first time in
 seven years, they say--so nice of it to do it just when we are here!I
 would not have missed it for anything.The hospital has only had about
 forty patients for some time, as there has been no fighting, and it
 was just as well when we were so short of wood.We collected them all
 into one ward, and let the other fires out.‘The chief of the medical department held an inspection.Took off the
 men’s shirts and looked for lice, turned up the sheets, and beat the
 mattresses to look for dust, tasted the men’s food, and in the end
 stated we were _ochin chesté_ (very clean), and that the patients
 were well cared for medically and well nursed.All of which was
 very satisfactory, but he added that the condition of the orderlies
 was disgraceful, and so it was.I hadn’t realised they were my job.However, I told him next time he came he should not find one single
 louse.Laird and I have a nice snug little room together.That is one
 blessing here, we have plenty of sun.Very soon it will begin to get
 quite hot.I woke up on the 1st of March and thought of getting home
 last year that day, and two days after waking up in Eve’s dear little
 room, with the roses on the roof.Bless all you dear people.--Ever
 your loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

      ‘_March 23, 1917._

 ‘We have been awfully excited and interested in the news from
 Petrograd.We heard of it, probably long after you people at home
 knew all about it!It is most interesting to see how everybody is on
 the side of the change, from Russian officers, who come to tea and
 beam at us, and say, “Heresho” (good) to the men in the wards.In any
 case they say we shall find the difference all over the war area.One
 Russian officer, who was here before the news came, was talking about
 the Revolution in England two hundred years ago, and said it was the
 most interesting period of European history.“They say all these ideas
 began with the French Revolution, but they didn’t--they began long
 before in England,” he thought.He spoke English beautifully, and had
 had an English nurse.He had read Milton’s political pamphlets, and
 we wondered all the time whether he was thinking of changes in Russia
 after the war, but now I wonder if he knew the changes were coming
 sooner.‘Do you know we have all been given the St.Prince
 Dolgourokoff, who is in command on this front, arrived quite
 unexpectedly, just after roll call.The telegram saying he was coming
 arrived a quarter of an hour after he left!General Kropensky, the
 head of the Red Cross, rushed up, and the Prince arrived about two
 minutes after him.He went all over the hospital, and a member of
 his gilded staff told matron he was very pleased with everything.He decorated two men in the wards with St.George’s Medal, and then
 said he wanted to see us together, and shook hands with everybody and
 said, “Thank you,” and gave each of us a medal too; Dr.Laird’s was
 for service, as she had not been under fire.George’s Medal is a
 silver one with “For Bravery” on its back.Our patients were awfully
 pleased, and inpressed on us that it carried with it a pension of a
 rouble a month for life.We gave them all cigarettes to commemorate
 the occasion.‘It was rather satisfactory to see how the hospital looked in its
 ordinary, and even I was _fairly_ satisfied.I tell the unit that
 they must remember that they have an old maid as commandant, and must
 live up to it!I cannot stand dirt, and crooked charts and crumpled
 sheets.One Sister, I hear, put it delightfully in a letter home: “Our
 C.M.O.is an idealist!” I thought that was rather sweet; I believe she
 added, “but she does appreciate good work.” Certainly, I appreciate
 hers.She is in charge of the room for dressings, and it is one of the
 thoroughly satisfactory points in the hospital.‘The Greek priest came yesterday to bless the hospital.We put up
 “Icons” in each of the four wards.The Russians are a very religious
 people, and it seems to appeal to some mystic sense in them.The
 priest just put on a stole, green and gold, and came in his long grey
 cloak.The two wards open out of one another, so he held the service
 in one, the men all saying the responses and crossing themselves.The
 four icons lay on the table before him, with three lighted candles at
 the inner comers, and he blessed water and sprinkled them, and then he
 sprinkled everybody in the room.The icons were fixed up in the corner
 of the wards, and I bought little lamps to burn in front of them, as
 they always have them.We are going to have the evening hymn sung
 every evening at six o’clock.I heard that first in Serbia from those
 poor Russian prisoners, who sang it regularly every evening.The night nurses come up from the
 village literally wet through, having dragged one another out of mud
 holes all the way.Now, a cart goes down to fetch them each evening.We have twenty horses and nine carts belonging to us.I have made Vera
 Holme master of the horse.‘I have heard two delightful stories from the Sisters who have
 returned from Odessa.There is a great rivalry between the Armoured
 Car men and the British Red Cross men, about the capabilities of
 their Sisters.(We, it appears, are the Armoured Car Sisters!)man said their Sisters were so smart they got a man on to the
 operating-table five minutes after the other one went off.Said an
 Armoured Car man: “But that’s nothing.The Scottish Sisters get the
 second one on before the first one is off.” The other story runs that
 there was some idea of the men waiting all night on a quay, and the
 men said, “But you don’t think we are Scottish Sisters, sir, do you?”
 I have no doubt that refers to Galatz, where we made them work all
 night.’

      ‘RENI, _Easter Day, 1917_.‘We, all the patients, sick and wounded, belonging to the Army and
 Navy, and coming from different parts of the great, free Russia, who
 are at present in your hospital, are filled with feelings of the
 truest respect for you.We think it our duty as citizens on this
 beautiful day of Holy Easter to express to you, highly respected and
 much beloved Doctor, as well as to your whole Unit, our best thanks
 for all the care and attention you have bestowed upon us.We bow low
 and very respectfully before the constant and useful work which we
 have seen daily, and which we know to be for the well-being of our
 allied countries.‘We are quite sure that, thanks to the complete unity of action of
 all the allied countries, the hour of gladness and the triumph of the
 Allied arms in the cause of humanity and the honour of nations is near.‘_Vive l’Angleterre!_

      ‘Russian Soldiers, Citizens, and the Russian Sister,
      ’VERA V. DE KOLESNIKOFF.’

      ‘RENI, _March 2, 1917_.‘DARLING EVE,--Very many thanks for the war prayers.The Archbishop’s prayers that I wanted are the
 original ones at the beginning of the war.Just at present we are
 very lucky as regards the singing, as there are three or four capital
 voices in the unit.We have the service at 1.30 on Sunday.That lets
 all the morning work be finished.I do wonder what has become of Miss
 Henderson and the new orderlies!We want them all
 so badly, not to speak of my cool uniform.That will be needed very
 soon I think.We are having
 glorious weather, so sunny and warm.All the snow has gone, and the
 mud is appalling.I thought I knew the worst mud could do in Serbia,
 but it was nothing to this.We have made little tiled paths all about
 our domain, and keep comparatively clean there.I wish we could take
 over the lot of buildings.The other day I thought I had made a great
 score, and bought two thousand poud of wood at a very small price.It
 was thirty-five versts out.We got the Cossacks to lend us transport.But the transport stuck in the mud, and came back the next day, having
 had to haul the empty carts out of mud holes by harnessing four horses
 first to one cart and then to another.It was no wonder I got the wood
 so cheap.‘_April 18, 1918._

 ‘I am writing this sitting out in my little tent, with a glorious
 view over the Danube.We have pitched some of the tents to relieve
 the crowding in the house.They are no longer beautiful and white, as
 they were at Medgidia.We have had to stain them a dirty grey colour,
 so as to hide them from aeroplanes.Yesterday, we had an awful gale,
 and a downpour of rain, and the tents stood splendidly, and not a
 drop of water came through.Miss Pleister and the Austrian orderly
 who helped her to pitch them are triumphant.Do get our spy-incident,
 from the office.We had an awful
 two days, but it is quite a joke to look back on.The unit were most
 thoroughly and Britishly angry.But I very soon saw
 the other side, and managed to get them in hand once more.General
 Kropensky, our chief, was a perfect brick.The armoured car section
 sent a special despatch rider over to Galatz to fetch him, and he came
 off at once.He talks perfect English, and he has since written me a
 charming letter saying our _sang-froid_ and our _savoir-faire_ saved
 the situation.I am afraid there was not much _sang-froid_ among us,
 but some of us managed to keep hold of our common sense.As I told
 the girls, in common fairness they must look at the other side--spy
 fever raging, a foreign hospital right on the front, and a Revolution
 in progress.I told them, even if they did not care about Russia, I
 supposed they cared about the war and England, and I wondered what
 effect it would have on all these Russian soldiers if we went away
 with the thing not cleared up, and still under suspicion.After all,
 the ordinary Russian soldier knows nothing about England, except in
 the very concrete form of _us_.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.We should have played right into the
 devil’s hands if we had gone away.Of course, they saw it at once,
 and we stuck to our guns for England’s sake.The 6th Army, I think,
 understands that England, as represented by this small unit, is keen
 on the war, and does not spy!We have had a telegram from the General
 in command, apologising, and our patients have been perfectly angelic.And the men from all regiments round come up to the out-patients’
 department, and are most grateful and punctiliously polite.You know the Russian greeting
 on Easter morning, “Christ is risen,” and the answer, “He is risen
 indeed.” We learnt them both, and made our greetings in Russian
 fashion.On Easter Eve we went to the church in the village.The church was crowded with soldiers--very
 few women there.They were most reverent and absorbed outside in the
 courtyards.It was a very curious scene; little groups of people with
 lighted candles waiting to get in.Here, we had a very nice Easter
 service.My “choir” had three lovely Easter hymns, and we even sang
 the Magnificat.One of the armoured car men, on his way from Galatz
 to Belgrade, stayed for the service, and it was nice to have a man’s
 voice in the singing.Except that we are very idle, we are very happy here.Our patients are
 delightful, the hospital in good order.The Steppe is a fascinating
 place to wander over, the little valleys, and the villages hidden
 away in them, and the flowers!We have been riding our transport
 horses--rather rough, but quite nice and gentle.We all ride astride
 of course.‘_On Active Service._

      ‘To Mrs.FLINDERS PETRIE,
      Hon.Sec., Scottish Women’s Hospitals.‘RENI, _May 8, 1917_.PETRIE,--How perfectly splendid about the Egyptologists.Miss Henderson brought me your message, saying how splendidly they are
 subscribing.That is of course all due to you, you wonderful woman.It was such a tantalising thing to hear that you had actually thought
 of coming out as an Administrator, and that you found you could not.I cannot tell you how splendid it would have been if you could have
 come.... I want “a woman of the world”... and I want an adaptable
 person, who will talk to the innumerable officers who swarm about this
 place, and ride with the girls, and manage the officials!‘I do wish you could see our hospital now.Such a nice story:--Matron was in Reni the other day, seeing the
 Commandant of the town about some things for the hospital, and when
 she came out she found a crowd of Russian soldiers standing round her
 house.They asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the
 Commandant was going to see about it.Whereupon the men said, “The
 Commandant must be told that the Scottish Hospital (_Schottlandsche
 bolnitza_) is the best hospital on this front, and must have whatever
 it wants.That is the opinion of the Russian Soldier.” Do you
 recognise the echo of the big reverberation that has shaken Russia.We get on awfully well with the Russian soldier.Two of our patients
 were overheard talking the other day, and they said, “The Russian
 Sisters are pretty but not good, and the English Sisters are good
 and not pretty.” The story was brought up to the mess-room by quite
 a nice-looking girl who had overheard it.But we thought we’d let
 the judgment stand and be like Kingsley’s “maid”--though we _don’t_
 undertake to endorse the Russian part of it!‘We have got some of the _personnel_ tents pitched now, and it is
 delightful.It was rather close quarters in the little house.I am
 writing in my tent now, looking out over the Danube.Such a lovely
 place, Reni is--and the Steppe is fascinating with its wide plains and
 little unexpected valleys full of flowers.The other night our camp was the centre of a fight.They are drilling recruits here, and suddenly the other
 night we found ourselves being defended by one party while another
 attacked from the Steppe.The battle raged all night, and the camp was
 finally carried at four o’clock in the morning amid shouts and cheers
 and barking of dogs.It was even too much for me, and I have slept
 through bombardments.‘It has been so nice hearing about you all from Miss Henderson.How
 splendidly the money is coming in.Petrie,
 _do_ make them send the reliefs more quickly.I know all about boats,
 but, as you knew the orderlies had to leave on the 15th of January,
 the reliefs ought to have been off by the 1st.‘I wish you could hear the men singing their evening hymn in hospital.I am so glad we thought of putting up the
 icons for them.‘Good-bye for the present, dear Mrs.My kindest regards to
 Professor Flinders Petrie.--Ever yours affectionately,

      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

      ‘_May 11, 1917._

 ‘It was delightful seeing Miss Henderson, and getting news of all you
 dear people.But she did arrive
 with all her equipment.The equipment I wired for in October, and
 which was sent out by itself, arrived in Petrograd, got through to
 Jassy, and has there stuck.We have not got a single thing, and the
 Consuls have done their best.French, one of the chaplains in Petrograd, came here.He said
 he would have some services here.We pitched a tent, and we had the
 Communion.I have sent down a notice to the armoured car
 yacht, and I hope some of the men will come up.We and they are the
 only English people here.‘The Serbs have sent me a message saying we may have to rejoin our
 Division soon.I don’t put too much weight on this, because I know
 my dearly beloved Serbs, and their habit of saying the thing they
 think you would like, but still we are preparing.I shall be very
 sorry to leave our dear little hospital here, and the Russians.They
 are a fascinating people, especially the common soldier.I hope that
 as we have done this work for the Russians and therefore have some
 little claim on them, it will help us to get things more easily for
 the Serbs.We have one little laddie in, about ten years old, the
 most amusing brat.He was wounded by an aeroplane bomb in a village
 seven versts out, and was sent into Reni to a hospital.But, when he
 got there he found the hospital was for sick only (a very inferior
 place!He wanders about with a Russian
 soldier’s cap on his head and wrapped round with a blanket, and we
 hear his pretty little voice singing to himself all over the place.‘Nicolai, the man who came in when the hospital was first opened,
 and has been so very ill, is really getting better.He had his
 dressing left for two days for the first time the other day, and his
 excitement and joy were quite pathetic.“_Ochin heroshe doktorutza,
 ochin herosho_” (Very good, dear doctor, very good), he kept saying,
 and then he added, “Now, I know I am not going to die!” Poor boy,
 he has nearly died several times, and would have died if he had not
 had English Sisters to nurse him.He has been awfully naughty--the
 wretch.He bit one of the Sisters one day when she tried to give him
 his medicine.Now, he kisses my hand to make up.The other day I
 ordered massage for his leg, and he made the most awful row, howled
 and whined, and declared it would hurt (really, he has had enough pain
 to destroy anybody’s nerve), and then suddenly pointed to a Sister who
 had come in, and said what she had done for him was the right thing.I asked what she had done for him; “Massaged his leg,” she said.I
 got that promptly translated into Russian, and the whole room roared
 with laughter.Poor Nicolai--after a minute, he joined in.His home
 is in Serbia, “a very nice home with a beautiful garden.” His mother
 is evidently the important person there.His father is a smith, and
 he had meant to be a smith too, but now he has got the St.George’s
 Cross, which carries with it a pension of six roubles a month, and he
 does not think he will do any work at all.He is the eldest of the
 family, twenty-four years old, and has three sisters, and a little
 brother of five.Can’t you imagine how he was spoilt!and how proud
 they are of him now, only twenty-four, and a _sous-officier_, and
 been awarded the St.George’s Cross which is better than the medal;
 and been wounded, four months in hospital, and had three operations!He has been so ill I am afraid the spoiling continued in the Scottish
 Women’s Hospital.Laird says she would not be his future wife for
 anything.‘We admitted such a nice-looking boy to-day, with thick, curly, yellow
 hair, which I had ruthlessly cropped, against his strong opposition.I
 doubt if I should have had the heart, if I had known how ill he was.I found him this evening with
 tears running silently over his cheeks, a Cossack, a great big man.He may have to go on to Odessa, as a severe
 operation and bombs and a nervous breakdown don’t go together.‘We have made friends with lots of the officers; there is one, also
 a Cossack, who spends a great part of his time here.His regiment is
 at the front, and he has been left for some special work, and he seems
 rather lonely.He is a nice boy, and brings nice horses for us to
 ride.We have been having quite a lot of riding, on our own transport
 horses too.It is heavenly riding here across the great plain.We all
 ride astride, and at first we found the Cossacks’ saddles most awfully
 uncomfortable, but now we are quite used to them.Our days fly past
 here, and in a sense are monotonous, but I don’t think we are any of
 us the worse for a little monotony as an interlude!quite fairly
 often there is a party at one of the regiments here!The girls enjoy
 them, and matron and I chaperone them alternately and reluctantly.It
 was quite a rest during Lent when there were no parties.‘The spy incident has quite ended, and we have won.Matron was in Reni
 the other day asking the Commandant about something, and when she came
 out she found a little crowd of Russian soldiers round her house.They
 asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the Commandant
 had said he would see about it.They answered, “The Commandant must
 be told that the S.W.H.is the best hospital on this front, and that
 it must have everything it wants.” That is the opinion of the Russian
 soldier!If you were here you would recognise the new tone of the
 Russian soldier in these days,--but I am glad he approves of our
 hospital.’

      ‘ODESSA, _June 24, 1917_.‘I wish you could realise how the little nations, Serbs and Rumanians
 and Poles, count on us.What a comfort it is to them to think we are
 “the most tenacious” nation in Europe.In their eyes it all hangs on
 us.I don’t believe we can disentangle
 it all in our minds just now.The only thing is just to go on doing
 one’s bit.Because, one thing is quite clear, Europe won’t be a
 habitable place if Germany wins--for anybody.‘I think there are going to be a lot of changes here.’

      ‘_July 15, 1917._

 ‘I have had German measles!The Consul asked me what I meant by that
 at my time of life!The majority of people say how unpatriotic and
 Hunnish of you!Well, a few days off did not do me any harm.I had
 a very luxurious time lying in my tent.The last lot of orderlies
 brought it out.’

      ‘ODESSA, _Aug.‘The work at Reni is coming to an end, and we are to go to the front
 with the Serbian Division.I cannot write about it owing to censors
 and people.But I am going to risk this: the Serbs ought to be most
 awfully proud.The Russian General on the front is going to insist on
 having them “to stiffen up his Russian troops.” I think you people at
 home ought to know what magnificent fighting men these Serbs are, and
 so splendidly disciplined, simply worth their weight in gold.There
 are only two divisions of them after all.We have about thirty-five of
 them in hospital just now as sanitaries, and they are such a comfort;
 their quickness and their devotion is wonderful.The hospital was full
 and overflowing when I left--still Russians.Most of the cases were
 slight; a great many left hands, if you know what that _means_.I
 don’t think the British Army does know!‘We had a Red Cross inspecting officer down from Petrograd.He was
 very pleased with everything, and kissed my hand on departing, and
 said we were doing great things for the Alliance.I wanted to say many
 things, but thought I had better leave it alone.‘We are operating at 5 A.M.now, because the afternoons are so hot.The other day we began at 5, and had to go till 4 P.M.‘Matron and I had a delightful ride the other evening.Just as we
 had turned for home, an aeroplane appeared, and the first shot from
 the anti-aircraft guns close beside us was too much for our horses,
 who promptly bolted.However, there was nothing but the clear Steppe
 before us, so we just sat tight and went.After a little they
 recovered themselves, and really behaved very well.’

      ‘_Aug.28._

 ‘You dear, dear people, how sweet of you to send me a telegram for
 my birthday.You don’t know how nice it was to get it and to feel you
 were thinking of me.Miss G. brought it
 me with a very puzzled face, and said, “I cannot quite make out this
 telegram.” It was written in Russian characters.She evidently was not
 used to people doing such mad things as telegraphing the “Many happy
 returns of the day” half across the world.I understood it at once,
 and it nearly made me cry.It was good to get it, though I think the
 Food Controller or somebody ought to come down on you for wasting
 money in the middle of a war.‘I am finishing this letter in Reni.We closed the hospital yesterday,
 and joined our Division somewhere on Friday.The rush that had begun
 before I got to Odessa got much worse.They had an awfully busy time,
 a faint reminiscence of Galatz, though, as they were operating twelve
 hours on end, I don’t know it was so very faint.We had no more left
 hands, but all the bad cases.Everybody worked magnificently, but they
 always do in a push.The time a British unit goes to pieces is when
 there is nothing to do!‘So this bit of work ends, eight months.I am quite sorry to leave it,
 but quite quite glad to get back to our Division.‘Well, Amy dearest, good-bye for the present.Love to all you dear people.’

      ‘S.W.H.,
      ‘HADJI ABDUL, _Oct.‘I wonder if this is my last letter from Russia!We hope to be off
 in a very few days now.We have had a very pleasant time in this
 place with its Turkish name.We are with the Division, and were given this perfectly beautiful
 camping-ground, with trees, and a <DW72> towards the east.The question
 was whether we were going to Rumania or elsewhere.It is nice being
 back with these nice people.They have been most kind and friendly,
 and we have picnics and rides and _dances_, and dinners, and till this
 turmoil of the move began we had an afternoon reception every day
 under the walnut trees!Now, we are packed up and ready to go, and I
 mean to walk in on you one morning.‘We shall have about two months to refit, but one of those is my due
 as a holiday, _which I am going to take_.I’ll see you all soon.--Your
 loving aunt,

      ‘ARCHANGEL, _Nov.Have not been very well; nothing to worry about.Shall report in London, then come straight to you.‘INGLIS.’




CHAPTER XI

THE MOORINGS CUT

    ‘Not I, but my Unit.’

    ‘My dear Unit, good-bye.’--Nov.‘Into the wide deep seas which we call God
    You plunged.This is not death,
    You seemed to say, but fuller life.’

The reports of Dr.Inglis as chief medical officer to the London
Committee were as detailed and foreseeing in the very last one that
she wrote as in the first from on board the transport that took her
and her unit out.She writes:--‘In view of the fact that we are in the
middle of big happenings I should like Dr.Laird to bring ½ ton cotton
wool, six bales moss dressings, 100 lb.ether, 20
gallons rectified spirits.I wonder what news of the river boat for
Mesopotamia?’ After they had landed and were at work:--‘I have wired
asking for another hospital for the base.I know you have your hands
full, but I also know that if the people at home realise what their
help would mean out here just now, we would not have to ask twice.And
again:--’Keep the home fires burning and let us feel their warmth.’ She
soon encountered the usual obstacles:--‘I saw that there was no good in
the world talking about regular field hospitals to them until they had
tried our mettle.The ordinary male disbelief in our capacity cannot
be argued away.It can only be worked away.’ So she acted.Russia
created disbelief, but the men at arms of all nations saw and believed.In November she wrote back incredulously:--‘Rumours of falling back.Anxious about the equipment.’ In bombardments, in
retreat, and evacuations the equipment was her one thought.‘Stand by
the equipment’ became a joke in her unit.On one occasion one of the
orderlies had a heavy fall from a lorry on which she was in charge of
the precious stuff.Dusty and shaken, she was gathering herself up,
when the voice of the chief rang out imperatively urgent, ‘Stand by the
equipment.’ On the rail certain trucks, bearing all the equipment, got
on a wrong line, and were carried away:--‘The blue ribbon belongs to
Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown.They saw our wagons disappearing with
a refugee train, whereupon these two ran after it and jumped on, and
finally brought the equipment safely to Galatz.They invented a General
Popovitch who would be very angry if it did not get through.Without
those two girls and their ingenuity, the equipment would not have got
through.’

She details all the difficulties of packing up and evacuating after
the despatch rider came with the order that the hospitals were to
fall back to Galatz.The only method their own, all else chaotic and
helpless, working night and day, the unit accomplished everything.At
the station, packed with a country and army in flight, Dr.Inglis had a
talk with a Rumanian officer.He told her that he had been in Glasgow,
and had there been invited out to dinner, and had seen ‘English
customs.’ ‘It was good to feel those English customs were still going
on quietly, whatever was happening here, breakfast coming regularly and
hot water for baths, and everything as it should be.It was probably
absurd, but it came like a great wave of comfort to feel that England
was there quiet and strong and invincible behind everything and
everybody.’

As we read these natural vivid diary reports, we too can feel it was
good of England that Dr.Inglis was to the last on that front--

    ‘Ambassador from Britain’s Crown,
      And type of all her race.’

Dr.Inglis never lost sight of the Army she went out to serve.She
refused to return unless they were brought away from the Russian front
with her.‘I wonder if a proper account of what happened then went home to
 the English papers?The Serbian Division went into the fight 15,000
 strong.They were in the centre--the Rumanians on their left, and the
 Russians on their right.The Rumanians broke, and they fought for
 twenty-four hours on two fronts.They came out of the fight, having
 lost 11,000 men.It is almost incredible, and that is when we ought to
 have been out, and could have been out if we had not taken so long to
 get under way.’

In the last Report, dated October 29, 1917, she tells her Committee she
has been ‘tied by the leg to bed.’ There are notes on coming events:--

 ‘There really seems a prospect of getting away soon.The Foreign
 Office knows us only too well.Only 6000 of the Division go in this
 lot, the rest (15,000) to follow.’

There is a characteristic last touch.‘I have asked Miss Onslow to get English paper-back novels for the
 unit on their journey.At a certain shop, they can be got for a rouble
 each, and good ones.’

To members of that unit, doctors, sisters, orderlies, we are indebted
for many personal details, and for the story of the voyage west,
when for her the sun was setting.Her work was accomplished when on
the transport with her and her unit were the representatives of that
Serbian Army with whom she served, faithful unto death.Miss Arbuthnot, the granddaughter of Sir William Muir, the friend of
John Inglis, was one of those who helped to nurse Dr.Inglis:--

 ‘I sometimes looked after her when the Sister attending her was
 off duty.Her consideration and kindness were quite extraordinary,
 while her will and courage were quite indomitable.To die as she did
 in harness, having completed her great work in getting the Serbs away
 from Russia, is what she would have chosen.Inglis at Hadji Abdul, a small mud village about ten
 miles from Galatz.She was looking very ill, but was always busy.For
 some time she had been ill with dysentery, but she never even stayed
 in bed for breakfast till it was impossible for her to move from bed.‘During our time at Hadji we had about forty Serbian patients, a few
 wounded, but mostly sick.Inglis did a few minor operations, but
 her last major one was a gastro-enterotomy performed on one of our own
 chauffeurs, a Serb, Joe, by name.The operation took three hours and
 was entirely satisfactory, although Dr.Inglis did not consider him
 strong enough to travel back to England.She was particularly fond of
 this man, and took no end of trouble with him.Even after she became
 so very ill she used constantly to visit him.‘The Serbs entertained us to several picnics, which we duly returned.Inglis was always an excellent hostess, so charming and genial
 to every one, and so eager that both entertainers and entertained
 should equally enjoy themselves.Provided her permission was asked
 first, and duty hours or regular meals not neglected, she was always
 keen every one should enjoy themselves riding, walking, or going for
 picnics.If any one was ill, she never insisted on their getting up
 in spite of everything, as most doctors, and certainly all matrons,
 wish us to do.She was strict during duty hours, and always required
 implicit obedience to her orders--whatever they were.She was always
 so well groomed--never a hair out of place.One felt so proud of her among the dirty and generally
 unsuitably dressed women in other hospitals.She was very independent,
 and would never allow any of us to wait on her.The cooks were not
 allowed to make her any special dishes that the whole unit could not
 share.As long as she could, she messed with the unit, and there was
 no possibility of avoiding her quick eye; anything which was reserved
 for her special comfort was rejected.Once, a portion of chicken was
 kept as a surprise for her.She asked whether there had been enough
 for all, and when the cooks reluctantly confessed there was only the
 one portion she sent it away.‘During one of the evacuations, an order had been given that there
 were only two blankets allowed in each valise.Some one, mindful of
 her weakness, stuffed an extra one into Dr.Inglis’ bag, because in
 her emaciated condition she suffered much from the cold.It stirred
 her to impetuous anger, and with something of the spirit of David, as
 he poured out the water brought him at the peril of the lives of his
 followers, she flung the blanket out of the railway carriage, as a
 lesson to those of her unit who had disobeyed an order.Inglis read the Church service with great dignity
 and simplicity.On the weekday evenings, before she became so ill,
 she would join us in a game of bridge, and played nearly every night.During the retreats when nothing more could be done, and she felt
 anxious, she would sit down and play a game of patience.During the
 weeks of uncertainty, when the future of the Serbs was doubtful, and
 she was unable to take any active part, she fretted very much.‘After endless conflicting rumours and days of waiting, the
 news arrived that they were to go to England.Her delight was
 extraordinary, for she had lain in her bed day after day planning how
 she could help them, and sending endless wires to those in authority
 in England, but feeling herself very impotent.Once the good news
 arrived, her marvellous courage and tenacity helped her to recover
 sufficiently, and prepare all the details for the journey with the
 Serbs.We left on the 29th October, with the H.G.Staff and two
 thousand Serbian soldiers, in a special train going to Archangel.Inglis spent fifteen days on the train, in a second-class
 compartment, with no proper bed.Her strength varied, but she was
 compelled to lie down a great deal, although she insisted on dressing
 every morning.On two occasions she walked for five minutes on the
 station platform; each time it absolutely exhausted her.Though she
 suffered much pain and discomfort, she never complained.She could
 only have benger, chicken broth and condensed milk, and she often
 found it impossible to take even these.If one happened to bring her
 tea, or her food, she thanked one so charmingly.‘At Archangel there was no means of carrying her on to the boat, so
 with help (one orderly in front, and one lifting her behind), she
 climbed a ladder twenty feet high, from the platform to the deck of
 the transport.She was a good sailor, and had a comfortable cabin on
 the ship.She improved on board slightly, and used to sit in the small
 cabin allotted to us on the upper deck.She played patience, and was
 interested in our sea-sick symptoms.There was a young naval officer
 very seriously ill on the boat.Our people were nursing him, and she
 constantly went to prescribe; she feared he would not live, and he
 died before we reached our port.Inglis had a relapse; violent pain set
 in, and she had to return to bed.Even then, a few days before we
 reached England, she insisted on going through all the accounts,
 and prepared fresh plans to take the unit on to join the Serbs at
 Salonika.In six weeks she expected to be ready to start.She sent for
 each of us in turn, and asked if we would go with her.Needless to
 say, only those who could not again leave home, refused, and then with
 the deepest regret.Inglis
 had a violent attack of pain, and had no sleep all night.Next morning
 she insisted on getting up to say good-bye to the Serbian staff.‘It was a wonderful example of her courage and fortitude, to see her
 standing unsupported--a splendid figure of quiet dignity.Her face
 ashen and drawn like a mask, dressed in her worn uniform coat, with
 the faded ribbons that had seen such good service.As the officers
 kissed her hand, and thanked her for all she had done for them, she
 said to each of them a few words accompanied with her wonderful smile.’

As they looked on her, they also must have understood, ‘sorrowing most
of all, that they should see her face no more.’

 ‘After that parting was over, Dr.She left the boat Sunday afternoon, 25th November, and
 arrived quite exhausted at the hotel.I was allowed to see her for
 a minute before the unit left for London that night.She could only
 whisper, but was as sweet and patient as she ever was.She said we
 should meet soon in London.’

After her death, many who had watched her through these strenuous
years, regretted that she did not take more care of herself.Symptoms
of the disease appeared so soon, she must have known what overwork and
war rations meant in her state.This may be said of every follower of
the One who saved others, but could not save Himself.The life story
of Saint and Pioneer is always the same.To continue to ill-treat
‘brother body’ meant death to St.Francis; to remain in the fever
swamps of Africa meant death to Livingstone.The poor, and the freedom
of the slave, were the common cause for which both these laid down
their lives.Of the same spirit was this daughter of our race.Had she
remained at home on her return from Serbia she might have been with us
to-day, but we should not have the woman we now know, and for whom we
give thanks on every remembrance of her.Miss Arbuthnot makes no allusion to
its dangers.Everything written by the ‘unit’ is instinct with the
high courage of their leader.We know now how great were the perils
surrounding the transports on the North seas.Old, and unseaworthy, the
menace below, the storm above, through the night of the Arctic Circle,
she was safely brought to the haven where all would be.More than once
death in open boats was a possibility to be faced; there were seven
feet of water in the engine-room, and only the stout hearts of her
captain and crew knew all the dangers of their long watch and ward.As the transport entered the Tyne a blizzard swept over the country.We who waited for news on shore wondered where on the cold grey seas
laboured the ship bringing home ‘Dr.Elsie and her unit.’

In her last hours she told her own people of the closing days on
board:--

 ‘When we left Orkney we had a dreadful passage, and even after we got
 into the river it was very rough.We were moored lower down, and,
 owing to the high wind and storm, a big liner suddenly bore down upon
 us, and came within a foot of cutting us in two, when our moorings
 broke, we swung round, and were saved.I said to the one who told
 me--“Who cut our moorings?” She answered, “No one cut them, they
 broke.”’

There was a pause, and then to her own she broke the knowledge that she
had heard the call and was about to obey the summons.‘The same hand who cut our moorings then is cutting mine now, and I am
 going forth.’

Her niece Evelyn Simson notes how they heard of the arrival:--

 ‘A wire came on Friday from Aunt Elsie, saying they had arrived in
 Newcastle.We tried all Saturday to get news by wire and ’phone,
 but got none.We think now this was because the first news came by
 wireless, and they did not land till Sunday.‘Aunt Elsie answered our prepaid wire, simply saying, “I am in bed, do
 not telephone for a few days.” I was free to start off by the night
 train, and arrived about 2 A.M.were
 at the Station Hotel, and I saw Aunt Elsie’s name in the book.I did
 not like to disturb her at that hour, and went to my room till 7.30.I
 found her alone; the night nurse was next door.She was surprised to
 see me, as she thought it would be noon before any one could arrive.She looked terribly wasted, but she gave me such a strong embrace that
 I never thought the illness was more than what might easily be cured
 on land, with suitable diet.‘I felt her pulse, and she said.“It is not very good, Eve dear, I
 know, for I have a pulse that beats in my head, and I know it has been
 dropping beats all night.” She wanted to know all about every one, and
 we had a long talk before any one came in.Ward had been to her, always, and we arranged that Dr.Aunt Elsie then packed me off to get some breakfast, and
 Dr.Ward told me she was much worse than she had been the night before.‘I telephoned to Edinburgh saying she was “very ill.” When Dr.Williams came, I learnt that there was practically no hope of her
 living.They started injections and oxygen, and Aunt Elsie said, “Now
 don’t think we didn’t think of all these things before, but on board
 ship nothing was possible.”

 ‘It was not till Dr.Williams’ second visit that she asked me if the
 doctor thought “this was the end.” When she saw that it was so, she
 at once said, without pause or hesitation, “Eve, it will be grand
 starting a new job over there,”--then, with a smile, “although there
 are two or three jobs here I would like to have finished.” After this
 her whole mind seemed taken up with the sending of last messages to
 her committees, units, friends, and relations.It simply amazed me how
 she remembered every one down to her grand-nieces and nephews.When I
 knew mother and Aunt Eva were on their way, I told her, and she was
 overjoyed.Early in the morning she told me wonderful things about
 bringing back the Serbs.I found it very hard to follow, as it was an
 unknown story to me.I clearly remember she went one day to the Consul
 in Odessa, and said she must wire certain things.She was told she
 could only wire straight to the War Office--“and so I got into touch
 straight with the War Office.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren at one moment commented--“You have done magnificent
 work.” Back swiftly came her answer, “Not I, but my unit.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren says: ‘Mrs.Simson and I arrived at Newcastle on Monday
 evening.It was a glorious experience to be with her those last two
 hours.She was emaciated almost beyond recognition, but all sense
 of her bodily weakness was lost in the grip one felt of the strong
 alert spirit, which dominated every one in the room.She was clear
 in her mind, and most loving to the end.The words she greeted us
 with were--“So, I am going over to the other side.” When she saw we
 could not believe it, she said, with a smile, “For a long time I
 _meant_ to live, but now I _know_ I am going.” She spoke naturally
 and expectantly of going over.Certainly she met the unknown with a
 cheer!As the minutes passed she seemed to be entering into some great
 experience, for she kept repeating, “This is wonderful--but this is
 wonderful.” Then, she would notice that some one of us was standing,
 and she would order us to sit down--another chair must be brought if
 there were not enough.To the end, she would revert to small details
 for our comfort.As flesh and heart failed, she seemed to be breasting
 some difficulty, and in her own strong way, without distress or fear,
 she asked for help, “You must all of you help me through this.” We
 repeated to her many words of comfort.Again and again she answered
 back, “I know.” One, standing at the foot of the bed, said to her,
 “You will give my love to father”; instantly the humorous smile lit
 her face, and she answered, “Of course I will.”

 ‘At her own request her sister read to her words of the life
 beyond--“Let not your heart be troubled--In my Father’s house are many
 mansions; if it were not so I would have told you,” and, even as they
 watched her, she fell on sleep.‘After she had left us, there remained with those that loved her only
 a great sense of triumph and perfect peace.The room seemed full of a
 glorious presence.One of us said, “This is not death; it makes one
 wish to follow after.”’

As ‘We’ waited those anxious weeks for the news of the arrival of Dr.Inglis and her Army, there were questionings, how we should welcome
and show her all love and service.The news quickly spread she was not
well--might be delayed in reaching London; the manner of greeting her
must be to ensure rest.The storm had spent itself, and the moon was riding high in a cloudless
heaven, when others waiting in Edinburgh on the 26th learnt the news
that she too had passed through the storm and shadows, and had crossed
the bar.That her work here was to end with her life had not entered the minds
of those who watched for her return, overjoyed to think of seeing her
face once more.She had concealed her mortal weakness so completely,
that even to her own the first note of warning had come with the words
that she had landed, but was in bed:--‘then we thought it was time one
of us should go to her.’

Her people brought her back to the city of her fathers, and to the
hearts who had sent her forth, and carried her on the wings of their
strong confidence.There was to be no more going forth of her active
feet in the service of man, and all that was mortal was carried for
the last time into the church she had loved so well.Then we knew and
understood that she had been called where His servants shall serve Him.The Madonna lilies, the lilies of France and of the fields, were placed
around her.Over her hung the torn banners of Scotland’s history.The
Scottish women had wrapped their country’s flag around them in one of
their hard-pressed flights.On her coffin, as she lay looking to the
East in high St.Giles’, were placed the flags of Great Britain and
Serbia.She had worn ‘the faded ribbons’ of the orders bestowed on her by
France, Russia, and Serbia.It has often been asked at home and abroad
why she had received no decorations at the hands of her Sovereign.It
is not an easy question to answer.Inglis was buried, amid marks of respect
and recognition which make that passing stand alone in the history of
the last rites of any of her fellow-citizens.Great was the company
gathered within the church.The chancel was filled by her family and
relatives--her Suffrage colleagues, representatives from all the
societies, the officials of the hospitals and hostels she had founded
at home, the units whom she had led and by whose aid she had done great
things abroad.Last and first of all true-hearted mourners the people
of Serbia represented by their Minister and members of the Legation.The chief of the Scottish Command was present, and by his orders
military honours were paid to this happy warrior of the Red Cross.The service had for its keynote the Hallelujah Chorus, which was played
as the procession left St.It was a thanksgiving instinct with
triumph and hope.The Resurrection and the Life was in prayer and
praise.The Dean of the Order of the Thistle revealed the thoughts of
many hearts in his farewell words:--

 ‘We are assembled this day with sad but proud and grateful hearts to
 remember before God a very dear and noble lady, our beloved sister,
 Elsie Inglis, who has been called to her rest.We mourn only for
 ourselves, not for her.She has died as she lived, in the clear light
 of faith and self-forgetfulness, and now her name is linked for ever
 with the great souls who have led the van of womanly service for God
 and man.A wondrous union of strength and tenderness, of courage
 and sweetness, she remains for us a bright and noble memory of high
 devotion and stainless honour.Especially to-day, in the presence of
 representatives of the land for which she died, we think of her as an
 immortal link between Serbia and Scotland, and as a symbol of that
 high courage which will sustain us, please God, till that stricken
 land is once again restored, and till the tragedy of war is eradicated
 and crowned with God’s great gifts of peace and of righteousness.’

The buglers of the Royal Scots sounded ‘the Reveille to the waking
morn,’ and the coffin with the Allied flags was placed on the gun
carriage.Women were in the majority of the massed crowd that awaited
the last passing.‘Why did they no gie her the V.C.?’ asked the
shawl-draped women holding the bairns of her care: these and many
another of her fellow-citizens lined the route and followed on foot
the long road across the city.As the procession was being formed,
Dr.Inglis’ last message was put into the hands of the members of the
London Committee for S.W.H.It ran:--

      ‘_November 26, 1917._

 ‘So sorry I cannot come to London.Will send Gwynn in a day or two with
 explanations and suggestions.Colonel Miliantinovitch and Colonel
 Tcholah Antitch were to make appointment this week or next from
 Winchester; do see them, and also as many of the committee as possible
 and show them every hospitality.They have been very kind to us, and
 whatever happens, dear Miss Palliser, do beg the Committee to make
 sure that they (the Serbs) have their hospitals and transport, for
 they do need them.‘Many thanks to the Committee for their kindness to me and their
 support of me.‘Dictated to Miss Evelyn Simson.’

How the people loved her!was the thought, as she passed through the
grief-stricken crowds.These, who knew her best, smiled as they said
one to another, ‘How all this would surprise her!’

Edinburgh is a city of spires and of God’s acres, the graves cut in
the living rock, within gardens and beside running waters.Across the
Water of Leith the long procession wound its way.Within sight of the
grave, it was granted to her grateful brethren, the representatives
of the Serbian nation, to carry her coffin, and lower it to the place
where the mortal in her was to lie in its last rest.Her life’s story
was grouped around her--the Serbian officers, the military of her own
nation at war, the women comrades of the common cause, the poor and
suffering--to one and all she had been the inspiring succourer.November mists had drifted all day across the city, veiling the
fortress strength of Scotland, and the wild wastes of seas over which
she had returned home to our island strength.Even as we turned and
left her, the grey clouds at eventide were transfused and glorified by
the crimson glow of the sunset on the hills of Time.Printed in Great Britain by T. and A. CONSTABLE, Printers to His

Transcriber’s note:

Illustrations have been moved to be near the text they illustrate.A very few changes have been made to punctuation for consistency.On page 210 “C’état” has been changed to “C’était” in “C’était
magnifique, magnifique!Ils sont les héros”.There were no sounds to be heard but the monotonous
chirp of the cricket, and the dismal piping of the frogs in the
meadow.Even the owl and the whip-poor-will had ceased their nocturnal
notes, and the stars looked more gloomy than he had ever seen them
before.There was no time to moralize over these things, though, as he walked
along, he could not help thinking how strange and solemn everything
seemed on that eventful night.It was an epoch in his history; one of
those turning points in human life, when all the works of nature and
art, borrowing the spirit which pervades the soul, assume odd and
unfamiliar forms.Harry was not old enough or wise enough to
comprehend the importance of the step he was taking; still he was
deeply impressed by the strangeness within and without.Taking his bundle from the hollow stump, he directed his steps toward
Pine Pleasant.He walked very slowly, for his feelings swelled within
him and retarded his steps.His imagination was busy with the past, or
wandering vaguely to the unexplored future, which with bright promises
tempted him to press on to the goal of prosperity.He yearned to be a
man; to leap in an instant over the years of discipline, that yawned
like a great gulf between his youth and his manhood.He wanted to be a
man, that his strong arm might strike great blows; that he might win
his way up to wealth and honor.Why couldn't he be a great man like Squire Walker.Squire West
wouldn't sound bad."One has only to be rich in order to be great," thought he."Why can't
I be rich, as well as anybody else?Who was that old fellow that saved
up his fourpences till he was worth a hundred thousand dollars?I can
do it as well as he, though I won't be as mean as they say he was,
anyhow.There are chances enough to get rich, and if I fail in one
thing, why--I can try again."Thus Harry mused as he walked along, and fixed a definite purpose
before him to be accomplished in life.It is true it was not a very
lofty or a very noble purpose, merely to be rich; but he had been
obliged to do his own philosophizing.He had not yet discovered the
true philosopher's stone.He had concluded, like the alchemists of
old, that it was the art of turning anything into gold.The paupers,
in their poverty, had talked most and prayed most for that which they
had not.Wealth was to them the loftiest ideal of happiness, and Harry
had adopted their conclusions.It is not strange, therefore, that
Harry's first resolve was to be a rich man."Seek ye _first_ the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be
added unto you," was a text which he had often heard repeated; but he
did not comprehend its meaning, and he had reversed the proposition,
determined to look out for "all these things" first.The village clock struck eleven, and the peal of the clear notes on
the silent air cut short his meditations, and admonished him to
quicken his pace, or Ben would reach the place of rendezvous before
him.He entered the still shades of Pine Pleasant, but saw nothing of
his confederate.Seating himself on the familiar rock in the river, he
returned to his meditations.He had hardly laid down his first proposition in solving the problem
of his future success, before he was startled by the discovery of a
bright light in the direction of the village.It was plainly a
building on fire, and his first impulse was to rush to the meeting
house and give the alarm; but prudence forbade.His business was with
the great world and the future, not with Redfield and the present.A few moments later the church bell pealed its startling notes, and he
heard the cry of fire in the village.The building, whatever it was,
had become a mass of fierce flames, which no human arm could stay.While he was watching the exciting spectacle, he heard footsteps in
the grove, and Ben Smart, out of breath and nearly exhausted, leaped
upon the rock."So you are here, Harry," gasped he."We have no time to waste now," panted Ben, rousing himself anew.Ben descended to the lower side of the rock, and hauled a small
flat-bottomed boat out of the bushes that grew on the river's brink."Never mind the fire now; jump into the boat, and let us be off."Harry obeyed, and Ben pushed off from the rock.asked Harry, not much pleased either with the
imperative tone or the haughty reserve of his companion.Take the paddle and steer her; the current will take
her along fast enough.I am so tired I can't do a thing more."Harry took the paddle and seated himself in the stern of the boat,
while Ben, puffing and blowing like a locomotive, placed himself at
the bow."Tell me now where the fire is," said Harry, whose curiosity would not
be longer resisted."_Squire Walker's barn._"




CHAPTER IV

IN WHICH IT IS SHOWN THAT THE NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER IS DIFFICULT AND
DANGEROUS


Harry was astounded at this information.Ben was exhausted, as though
he had been running very hard; besides, he was much agitated--more so
than the circumstances of the occasion seemed to justify.In
connection with the threat which his companion had uttered that day,
these appearances seemed to point to a solution of the burning
building.He readily understood that Ben, in revenge for the indignity
the squire had cast upon him, had set the barn on fire, and was now
running away by the light of it.This was more than he had bargained for.However ill-natured he felt
towards the squire for his proposal to send him to Jacob Wire's, it
never occurred to him to retaliate by committing a crime.His ideas of
Christian charity and of forgiveness were but partially developed; and
though he could not feel right towards his powerful enemy, he felt no
desire to punish him so severely as Ben had done.His companion gave him a short answer, and manifested no disposition
to enlarge upon the subject; and for several minutes both maintained a
profound silence.The boat, drifting slowly with the current, was passing from the pond
into the narrow river, and it required all Harry's skill to keep her
from striking the banks on either side.His mind was engrossed with
the contemplation of the new and startling event which had so suddenly
presented itself to embarrass his future operations.Ben was a
criminal in the eye of the law, and would be subjected to a severe
penalty if detected."I shouldn't have thought you would have done that," Harry observed,
when the silence became painful to him."Well, I can see through a millstone when there is a hole in it.""I didn't say I set the barn afire.""I know you didn't; but you said you meant to pay the squire off for
what he had done to you.""I didn't say I had," answered Ben, who was evidently debating with
himself whether he should admit Harry to his confidence."But didn't you set the barn afire?""Why, I should say you run a great risk.""I see the reason now, why you wouldn't tell me what you was going to
do before.""We are in for it now, Harry.I meant to pay off the squire, and--"

"Then you did set the barn afire?""I didn't say so; and, more than that, I don't mean to say so.If you
can see through a millstone, why, just open your eyes--that's all.""I am sorry you did it, Ben.""No whining, Harry; be a man.""I mean to be a man; but I don't think there was any need of burning
the barn.""I do; I couldn't leave Redfield without squaring accounts with Squire
Walker.""We will go by the river, as far as we can; then take to the road.""But this is George Leman's boat--isn't it?""Of course I did; you don't suppose I should mind trifles at such a
time as this!But he can have it again, when I have done with it.""What was the use of taking the boat?""In the first place, don't you think it is easier to sail in a boat
than to walk?And in the second place, the river runs through the
woods for five or six miles below Pine Pleasant; so that no one will
be likely to see us.It is full of rocks about three
miles down."We can keep her clear of the rocks well enough.When I was down the river last spring, you couldn't see a single rock
above water, and we don't draw more than six inches.""But that was in the spring, when the water was high.I don't believe
we can get the boat through.""Yes, we can; at any rate, we can jump ashore and tow her down,"
replied Ben, confidently, though his calculations were somewhat
disturbed by Harry's reasoning."There is another difficulty, Ben," suggested Harry."O, there are a hundred difficulties; but we mustn't mind them.""They will miss the boat, and suspect at once who has got it.""We shall be out of their reach when they miss it.""I heard George Leman say he was going a fishing in her to-morrow.""Because you didn't tell me what you were going to do."Never mind; it is no use to cry for spilt milk."That we are; and if you only stick by me, it will all come out right.If we get caught, you must keep a stiff upper lip.""And, above all, don't blow on me.""Whatever happens, promise that you will stick by me."On that, we will take a bit of luncheon,
and have a good time of it."As he spoke, Ben drew out from under the seat in the bow a box filled
with bread and cheese."You see we are provisioned for a cruise, Harry," added Ben, as he
offered the contents of the box to his companion."Here is enough to
last us two or three days.""But you don't mean to keep on the river so long as that?""I mean to stick to the boat as long as the navigation will permit,"
replied Ben, with more energy than he had before manifested, for he
was recovering from the perturbation with which the crime he had
committed filled his mind."There is a factory village, with a dam across the river, six or seven
miles below here.""I know it; but perhaps we can get the boat round the dam in the night
time, and continue our voyage below.Don't you remember that piece in
the Reader about John Ledyard--how he went down the Connecticut River
in a canoe?""Yes; and you got your idea from that?""I did; and I mean to have a first rate time of it."Ben proceeded to describe the anticipated pleasures of the river
voyage, as he munched his bread and cheese; and Harry listened with a
great deal of satisfaction.Running away was not such a terrible
thing, after all.It was both business and pleasure, and his
imagination was much inflated by the brilliant prospect before him.There was something so novel and exciting in the affair, that his
first experience was of the most delightful character.He forgot the crime his companion had committed, and had almost come
to regard the burning of the squire's barn as a just and proper
retribution upon him for conspiring against the rights and privileges
of young America.My young readers may not know how easy it is even for a good boy to
learn to love the companionship of those who are vicious, and disposed
to take the road which leads down to moral ruin and death.Those lines
of Pope, which are familiar to almost every school boy, convey a great
truth, and a thrilling warning to those who first find themselves
taking pleasure in the society of wicked men, or wicked boys:

    "Vice is a monster of so frightful mien
     As to be hated, needs but to be seen;
     But seen too oft, familiar with her face,
     We first endure, then pity, then embrace."Now, I have not represented my hero, at this stage of the story, as a
very good boy, and it did not require much time to familiarize him
with the wickedness which was in Ben's heart, and which he did not
take any pains to conceal.The transition from enduring to pitying and
from that to embracing was sudden and easy, if, indeed, there was any
middle passage between the first and last stage.I am sorry to say that an hour's fellowship with Ben, under the
exciting circumstances in which we find them, had led him to think Ben
a very good fellow, notwithstanding the crime he had committed.I
shall do my young reader the justice to believe he hopes Harry will be
a better boy, and obtain higher and nobler views of duty.It must be
remembered that Harry had never learned to "love God and man" on the
knee of an affectionate mother.He had long ago forgotten the little
prayers she had taught him, and none were said at the poorhouse.We
are sorry he was no better; but when we consider under what influences
he had been brought up, it is not strange that he was not a good boy.Above every earthly good, we may be thankful for the blessing of a
good home, where we have been taught our duty to God, to our
fellow-beings, and to ourselves.The young navigators talked lightly of the present and the future, as
the boat floated gently along through the gloomy forest.They heard
the Redfield clock strike twelve, and then one.The excitement had
begun to die out.Harry yawned, for he missed his accustomed sleep,
and felt that a few hours' rest in his bed at the poorhouse was even
preferable to navigating the river at midnight.Ben gaped several
times, and the fun was really getting very stale.Those "who go down to the sea in ships," or navigate the river in
boats, must keep their eyes open.It will never do to slumber at the
helm; and Harry soon had a practical demonstration of the truth of the
proposition.He was so sleepy that he could not possibly keep his eyes
open; and Ben, not having the care of the helm, had actually dropped
off, and was bowing as politely as a French dancing master to his
companion in the stern.They were a couple of smart sailors, and
needed a little wholesome discipline to teach them the duty of those
who are on the watch.The needed lesson was soon administered; for just as Ben was making
one of his lowest bows in his semi-conscious condition, the bow of the
boat ran upon a concealed rock, which caused her to keel over to one
side, and very gently pitch the sleeper into the river.Of course, this catastrophe brought the commander of the expedition to
his senses, and roused the helmsman to a sense of his own delinquency,
though it is clear that, as there were no lighthouses on the banks of
the river, and the intricacies of the channel had never been defined
and charted for the benefit of the adventurous navigator, no human
forethought could have provided against the accident.Harry put the boat about, and assisted his dripping shipmate on board
again.The ducking he had received did not operate very favorably upon
Ben's temper, and he roundly reproached his companion for his
carelessness.The steersman replied with becoming spirit to this
groundless charge, telling him he had better keep his eyes open the
rest of the night.Wet and chilly as he was, Ben couldn't help
growling; and both evidently realized that the affair was not half as
romantic as they had adjudged it to be an hour or two before.If we fail once let us try again--that's all."You want to drown me, don't you?"Harry assured him he did not, and called his attention to the sound of
dashing waters, which could now be plainly heard.They were
approaching the rocks, and it was certain from the noise that
difficult navigation was before them.Harry proposed to haul up by the
river's side, and wait for daylight; to which proposition Ben, whose
ardor was effectually cooled by the bath he had received, readily
assented.Accordingly they made fast the painter to a tree on the shore, and
both of them disembarked.While Harry was gathering up a pile of dead
leaves for a bed, Ben amused himself by wringing out his wet clothes."Suppose we make a fire, Harry?"suggested Ben; and it would certainly
have been a great luxury to one in his damp condition."No; it will betray us," replied Harry, with alarm.It is easy enough for you to talk, who are warm and dry,"
growled Ben."I am going to have a fire, anyhow."Ben had some matches in the boat, and in a
few minutes a cheerful fire blazed in the forest.As the leader of the
enterprise felt its glowing warmth his temper was sensibly impressed,
and he even had the hardihood to laugh at his late misfortune.But
Harry did not care just then whether his companion was pleasant or
sour, for he had stretched himself on his bed of leaves, and was in a
fair way to forget the trials and hardships of the voyage in the deep
sleep which makes it "all night" with a tired boy.After Ben was thoroughly dried and warmed, he placed himself by the
side of his fellow-voyager, and both journeyed together through the
quiet shades of dreamland, leaving no wakeful eye to watch over the
interests of the expedition while they slumbered.CHAPTER V

IN WHICH HARRY FIGHTS A HARD BATTLE, AND IS DEFEATED


The sun was high in the heavens when the tired boatmen awoke.Unaccustomed as they were to fatigue and late hours, they had been
completely overcome by the exertion and exposure of the previous
night.Harry was the first to recover his lost senses; and when he
opened his eyes, everything looked odd and strange to him.It was not
the rough, but neat and comfortable little room in the poorhouse which
greeted his dawning consciousness; it was the old forest and the
dashing river.He did not feel quite at home; the affair had been
divested of its air of romance, and he felt more like a runaway boy
than the hero of a fairy tale.Ben growled once, and then rolled over, as if angry at being
disturbed.We shall be caught if you don't wake up.There, the clock is
striking eight!"and to give Ben a better idea of where he was, he
administered a smart kick in the region of the ribs.snarled Ben, springing to his feet with clinched
fists.Don't you see how high the sun is?We are just as safe here as anywhere else.You
kick me again, and see where you will be!""Come, come, Ben; don't get mad."You do what I tell you, that's all you have to do
with it," replied Ben, imperiously, as he walked to the bank of the
river to survey the difficulties of the navigation.asked Harry, not particularly pleased with this
interpretation of their relations."I don't believe anything of the kind.I ain't your <DW65>, anyhow!""What are you going to do about it?""I'll let you know what I am going to do.""If you don't mind what I tell you, I'll wallop you on the spot.""No, you won't"; and Harry turned on his heel, and leisurely walked
off towards the thickest of the forest."Do you think I'm going to stay with you, to be treated like a dog!"replied Harry, as he continued his retreat.Ben started after him, but Harry picked up a stick of wood and stood
on the defensive."Now, if you don't come back, I'll break your head!""Look out that your own don't get broke"; and Harry brandished his
cudgel in the air.Ben glanced at the club, and saw from the flash of Harry's bright eye
that he was thoroughly aroused.His companion was not to be trifled
with, and he was ready to abandon the point."Come, Harry, it's no use for us to quarrel," he added, with a forced
smile."I know that; but I won't be trod upon by you or anybody else.""I don't want to tread on you.""Yes, you do; you needn't think you are going to lord it over me in
that way.I will go back to the poorhouse first.""Yes, and let you lick me, then!"I won't touch you, Harry; upon my word and honor, I won't."I'll go back, if you'll
behave yourself; but I shall keep the club handy.""Anyway you like; but let us be off."Ben changed his tone, and condescended to tell Harry what he meant to
do, even at the sacrifice of his dignity as commander of the
expedition.An appearance at least of good feeling was restored, and
after breakfasting on their bread and cheese, they embarked again, on
what promised to be a perilous voyage.For a quarter of a mile below, the bed of the narrow river was spotted
with rocks, among which the water dashed with a fury that threatened
the destruction of their frail bark.For a time they seriously debated
the question of abandoning the project, Harry proposing to penetrate
the woods in a northeasterly direction.Ben, however, could not
abandon the prospect of sailing leisurely down the river when they had
passed the rapids, making the passage without any exertion.He was not
pleased with the idea of trudging along on foot for thirty miles, when
the river would bear them to the city with only a little difficulty
occasionally at the rapids and shoal places.Perhaps his plan would
have been practicable at the highest stage of water, but the river was
now below its ordinary level.Ben's love of an easy and romantic time carried the day, and Harry's
practical common-sense reasoning was of no avail, and a taunt at his
cowardice induced him to yield the point."Now, Harry, you take one of the paddles, and place yourself in the
bow, while I steer," said Ben, as he assumed his position."Very well; you shall be captain of the boat, and I will do just as
you say; but I won't be bullied on shore," replied Harry, taking the
station assigned him."All right; now cast off the painter, and let her slide."Never fear me; I will do my share."The boat floated out into the current, and was borne rapidly down the
swift-flowing stream.They were not very skillful boatmen, and it was
more a matter of tact than of strength to keep the boat from dashing
on the sharp rocks.For a little way they did very well, though the
passage was sufficiently exciting to call their powers into action,
and to suggest a doubt as to the ultimate result of the venture.They soon reached a place, however, where the river turned a sharp
angle, and the waters were furiously precipitated down upon a bed of
rocks, which threatened them with instant destruction.exclaimed the foolhardy pilot, as his
eye measured the descent of the waters."Too late now," replied Harry, coolly.But Ben's courage all oozed out, in the face of this imminent peril,
and he made a vain attempt to push the boat toward the shore."Paddle your end round, Harry," gasped Ben, in the extremity of fear."Too late, Ben; stand stiff, and make the best of it," answered Harry,
as he braced himself to meet the shock.The rushing waters bore the boat down the stream in spite of the
feeble efforts of the pilot to check her progress.Ben seemed to have
lost all his self-possession, and stooped down, holding on with both
hands at the gunwale.Down she went into the boiling caldron of waters, roaring and foaming
like a little Niagara.One hard bump on the sharp rocks, and Harry
heard the boards snap under him.He waited for no more, but grasping
the over-hanging branches of a willow, which grew on the bank, and
upon which he had before fixed his eyes as the means of rescuing
himself, he sprang up into the tree, and saw Ben tumbled from the boat
into the seething caldron.But Harry had to save himself first, which, however, was not a
difficult matter.Swinging himself from branch to branch till he
reached the trunk of the willow, he descended to the ground, without
having even wet the soles of his shoes.cried Ben, in piteous accents, as the current bore
him down the stream."Hold on to the boat," replied Harry, "and I will be there in a
minute."Seizing a long pole which had some time formed a part of a fence
there, he hastened down the bank to the water's edge.The water was
not very deep, but it ran so rapidly that Ben could neither swim nor
stand upon the bottom; and but for his companion's promptness he would
undoubtedly have been drowned.Grasping the long pole which Harry
extended to him, he was drawn to the shore, having received no other
injury than a terrible fright and a good ducking."Here we are," said Harry, when his companion was safely landed."Yes, here we are," growled Ben; "and it is all your fault that we are
here.""It is my fault that _you_ are here; for if I had not pulled you out
of the river, you would have been drowned," replied Harry,
indignantly; and perhaps he felt a little sorry just then that he had
rescued his ungrateful commander."Yes, and if you had only done as I told you, and pushed for the shore
above the fall, all this would not have happened.""And if you hadn't been a fool, we should not have tried to go through
such a hole.There goes your old boat"; and Harry pointed to the
wreck, filled with water, floating down the stream.shouted a voice, not far from them."Not yet," replied Harry, with some trepidation, as he broke off a
piece of the pole that lay at his feet, and retreated from the river."Take a club, for I am not going to be carried back without fighting
for it."A survey of the ground and of the pursuers enabled him to prepare for
the future.He discovered at a glance the weakness of the assailants.Don't you see there is only one man on this side of
the river?Ben took the club; but he seemed not to have the energy to use it.In
fact, Harry showed himself better qualified to manage the present
interests of the expedition than his companion.All at once he
developed the attributes of a skillful commander, while his
confederate seemed to have lost all his cunning and all his
determination."Now, let us run; and if we are caught we will fight for it," said
Harry.The boys took to their heels, and having a fair start of their
pursuer, they kept clear of him for a considerable distance; but Ben's
wet clothes impeded his progress, and Harry had too much magnanimity
to save himself at the sacrifice of his companion.It was evident, after the chase had continued a short time, that
their pursuer was gaining upon them.In vain Harry urged Ben to
increase his speed; his progress was very slow, and it was soon
apparent to Harry that they were wasting their breath in running when
they would need it for the fight."Now, Ben, we can easily whip this man, and save ourselves.Be a man,
and let us stand by each other to the last."Ben made no reply; but when Harry stopped, he did the same.or we will knock your brains out," cried Harry, placing
himself in the attitude of defense.But the man took no notice of this piece of bravado; and as he
approached Harry leveled a blow at his head.The man warded it off,
and sprang forward to grasp the little rebel.shouted Harry, as he dodged the swoop of his
assailant.To his intense indignation and disgust, Ben, instead of seconding his
assault, dropped his club and fled.He seemed to run a good deal
faster than he had run before that day; but Harry did not give up the
point.The man pressed him closely, and he defended himself with a
skill and vigor worthy a better cause.But it was of no use; or, if it
was, it only gave Ben more time to effect his escape.The unequal contest, however, soon terminated in the capture of our
resolute hero, and the man tied his hands behind his back; but he did
not dare to leave the young lion to go in pursuit of his less
unfortunate, but more guilty, confederate."There, Master Harry West, I think you have got into a tight place
now," said his captor, whose name was Nathan Leman, brother of the
person to whom the boat belonged."We will soon put you in a place
where you won't burn any more barns."Harry was confounded at this charge, and promptly and indignantly
denied it.He had not considered the possibility of being accused of
such a crime, and it seemed to put a new aspect upon his case."You did not set fire to Squire Walker's barn last night?""Perhaps you can make the squire believe it," sneered his captor."Didn't steal my brother's boat, either, did you?"After the mean trick which Ben Smart had
served him, he did not feel very kindly towards him, but he was not
yet prepared to betray him.Nathan Leman then conducted his prisoner to the river's side.By this
time the other pursuer, who had been obliged to ascend the river for a
quarter of a mile before he could cross, joined him.This one fought like a young tiger, and I
couldn't leave him," replied Nathan."If you will take Harry up to the
village I will soon have him."The other assented, and while Nathan went in search of Ben, Harry was
conducted back to the village.The prisoner was sad and depressed in spirits; but he did not lose all
hope.He was appalled at the idea of being accused of burning the
barn; but he was innocent, and had a vague assurance that no harm
could befall him on that account.When they entered the village, a crowd gathered around them, eager to
learn the particulars of the capture; but without pausing to gratify
this curiosity, Harry's conductor led him to the poorhouse, and placed
him in charge of Mr.CHAPTER VI

IN WHICH HARRY CONCLUDES THAT A DEFEAT IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN A
VICTORY


The keeper of the poorhouse received Harry in sullen silence, and
conducted him to the chamber in which he had been ordered to keep him
a close prisoner.He apparently had lost all confidence in him, and
regretted that he had connived at his escape.Harry did not like the cold and repulsive deportment of his late
friend.Nason had always been kind to him; now he seemed to have
fallen in with Squire Walker's plans, and was willing to be the
instrument of the overseer's narrow and cruel policy.Before, he had
taken his part against the mighty, so far as it was prudent for him to
do so; now, he was willing to go over to the enemy.The reverse made him sadder than any other circumstance of his
return--sadder than the fear of punishment, or even of being sent to
live with Jacob Wire."I've got back again," said Harry, when they reached the chamber in
which he was to be confined.The keeper had never spoken to him in such tones, and Harry burst into
tears.His only friend had deserted him, and he felt more desolate
than ever before in his life."You needn't cry, now," said Mr."I can't help it," sobbed the little prisoner.Nason sneered as he spoke, and his sneer pierced the heart of
Harry.You needn't blubber any more.You have made your
bed, and now you can lie in it;" and the keeper turned on his heel to
leave the room."Don't leave me yet," pleaded Harry.I suppose you want to tell me I
advised you to burn the barn.""I didn't set the barn afire!"exclaimed Harry, now for the first time
realizing the cause of his friend's displeasure.I did not set it afire, or even know that it was
going to be set on fire."Nason closed the door which he had opened to depart.The firm
denial, as well as the tone and manner of the boy, arrested his
judgment against him.He had learned to place implicit confidence in
Harry's word; for, though he might have told lies to others, he never
told them to him.asked the keeper, looking sternly into the
eye of the culprit.A sense of honor and magnanimity pervaded his soul.He had obtained some false notions; and he did not understand that he
could hardly be false to one who had been false to himself--that to
help a criminal conceal his crime was to conspire against the peace
and happiness of his fellow-beings.Shabbily as Ben Smart had used
him, he could not make up his mind to betray him."Very well; you can do as you like.After what I had done for you, it
was a little strange that you should do as you have.""I will tell you all about it, Mr.Nason, if you will promise not to
tell."You and Ben Smart put your heads together to be
revenged on the squire; you set his barn afire, and then stole Leman's
boat.""No, sir; I didn't set the barn afire, nor steal the boat, nor help to
do either.""We were; and if it wasn't for being mean to Ben, I would tell you all
about it."As soon as it was known that you and Ben were missing,
everybody in the village knew who set the barn afire.All you have got
to do is to clear yourself, if you can; Ben is condemned already.""If you will hear my story I will tell you all about it."Harry proceeded to narrate everything that had occurred since he left
the house on the preceding night.It was a very clear and plausible
statement.Nason proposed with
promptness, and his replies were consistent."I believe you, Harry," said the keeper, when he had finished his
examination."Somehow I couldn't believe you would do such a thing as
set the squire's barn afire.""I wouldn't," replied Harry, warmly, and much pleased to find he had
re-established the confidence of his friend.The fact of your being with Ben Smart is almost
enough to convict you.""I shouldn't have been with him, if I had known he set the barn
afire.""I don't know as I can do anything for you, Harry; but I will try."Nason left him, and Harry had an opportunity to consider the
desperate circumstances of his position.It looked just as though he
should be sent to the house of correction.He
felt his innocence; as he expressed it to the keeper afterwards, he
"felt it in his bones."It did not, on further consideration, seem
probable that he would be punished for doing what he had not done,
either as principal or accessory.A vague idea of an all-pervading
justice consoled him; and he soon reasoned himself into a firm
assurance that he should escape unharmed.He was in the mood for reasoning just then--perhaps because he had
nothing better to do, or perhaps because the added experience of the
last twenty-four hours enabled him to reason better than before.His
fine scheme of getting to Boston, and there making a rich and great
man of himself, had signally failed."I have failed once, but I will try again," said he to himself, as the
conclusion of the whole matter; and he picked up an old school book
which lay on the table.The book contained a story, which he had often read, about a man who
had met with a long list of misfortunes, as he deemed them when they
occurred, but which proved to be blessings in disguise."Oft from apparent ills our blessings rise,
     Act well your part; there all the honor lies."This couplet from the school books came to his aid, also; and he
proceeded to make an application of this wisdom to his own mishaps."Suppose I had gone on with Ben.He is a miserable fellow," thought
Harry; "he would have led me into all manner of wickedness.I ought
not to have gone with him, or had anything to do with him.He might
have made a thief and a robber of me.I know I ain't any better than I
should be; but I don't believe I'm as bad as he is.At any rate, I
wouldn't set a barn afire.It is all for the best, just as the parson
says when anybody dies.By this scrape I have got clear of Ben, and
learned a lesson that I won't forget in a hurry."Harry was satisfied with this logic, and really believed that
something which an older and more devout person would have regarded as
a special providence had interposed to save him from a life of infamy
and wickedness.It was a blessed experience, and his thoughts were
very serious and earnest.In the afternoon Squire Walker came down to the poorhouse to subject
Harry to a preliminary examination.Ben Smart had not been taken, and
the pursuers had abandoned the chase."Boy," said the squire, when Harry was brought before him; "look at
me."Harry looked at the overseer with all his might.He had got far enough
to despise the haughty little great man.A taste of freedom had
enlarged his ideas and developed his native independence, so that he
did not quail, as the squire intended he should; on the contrary, his
eyes snapped with the earnestness of his gaze.With an honest and just
man, his unflinching eye would have been good evidence in his favor;
but the pompous overseer wished to awe him, rather than get at the
simple truth."You set my barn on fire," continued the squire."I did not," replied Harry, firmly.He had often read, and heard read, that passage of Scripture which
says, "Let your communication be Yea, yea, Nay, nay; for whatsoever is
more than these cometh of evil."Just then he felt the truth of the
inspired axiom.It seemed just as though any amount of violent
protestations would not help him; and though the squire repeated the
charge half a dozen times, he only replied with his firm and simple
denial.Then Squire Walker called his hired man, upon whose evidence he
depended for the conviction of the little incendiary.asked the squire, pointing to Harry."No, sir; it was a bigger boy than that," replied John, without
hesitation."It must be that this is the boy," persisted the squire, evidently
much disappointed by the testimony of the man."I am certain it was a bigger boy than this.""I feel pretty clear about it, Mr."You
see, this boy was mad, yesterday, because I wanted to send him to
Jacob Wire's.My barn is burned, and it stands to reason he burned
it.""But I saw the boy round the barn night afore last," interposed John,
who was certainly better qualified to be a justice of the peace than
his employer."I know that; but the barn wasn't burned till last night.""But Harry couldn't have had any grudge against you night before
last," said Mr."I don't know about that," mused the squire, who was apparently trying
to reconcile the facts to his theory, rather than the theory to the
facts.John, the hired man, lived about three miles from the squire's house.His father was very sick; and he had been home every evening for a
week, returning between ten and eleven.On the night preceding the
fire, he had seen a boy prowling round the barn, who ran away at his
approach.The next day, he found a pile of withered grass, dry sticks,
and other combustibles heaped against a loose board in the side of the
barn.He had informed the squire of the facts, but the worthy justice
did not consider them of much moment.Probably Ben had intended to burn the barn then, but had been
prevented from executing his purpose by the approach of the hired man."This must be the boy," added the squire."He had on a sack coat, and was bigger than this boy," replied John."Harry has no sack coat," put in Mr.Nason, eagerly catching at his
evidence."It is easy to be mistaken in the night.Search him, and see if there
are any matches about him."Undoubtedly this was a very brilliant suggestion of the squire's muddy
intellect--as though every man who carried matches was necessarily an
incendiary.But no matches were found upon Harry; and, according to
the intelligent justice's perception of the nature of evidence, the
suspected party should have been acquitted.No matches were found on Harry; but in his jacket pocket, carefully
enclosed in a piece of brown paper, were found the four quarters of a
dollar given to him by Mr."They were given to me," replied Harry.Nason averted his eyes, and was very uneasy.The fact of having
given this money to Harry went to show that he had been privy to his
escape; and his kind act seemed to threaten him with ruin."Answer me," thundered the squire.The boy was as firm as a hero; and no
threats could induce him to betray his kind friend, whose position he
fully comprehended."We will see," roared the squire.Several persons who had been present during the examination, and who
were satisfied that Harry was innocent of the crime charged upon him,
interfered to save him from the consequences of the squire's wrath.Nason, finding that his young friend was likely to suffer for his
magnanimity, explained the matter--thus turning the squire's anger
from the boy to himself."So you helped the boy run away--did you?""He did not; he told me that money would keep me from starving."Those present understood the allusion, and the squire did not press
the matter any further.In the course of the examination, Ben Smart
had often been alluded to, and the crime was fastened upon him.Harry
told his story, which, confirmed by the evidence of the hired man,
was fully credited by all except the squire, who had conceived a
violent antipathy to the boy.The examination was informal; the squire did not hold it as a justice
of the peace, but only as a citizen, or, at most, as an overseer of
the poor.However, it proved that, as the burning of the barn had been
planned before any difficulty had occurred between the squire and
Harry, he had no motive for doing the deed.The squire was not satisfied; but the worst he could do was to commit
Harry to the care of Jacob Wire, which was immediately done."I am sorry for you, Harry," whispered Mr."Never mind; I shall _try again_," he replied, as he jumped into the
wagon with his persecutor.CHAPTER VII

IN WHICH HARRY FINDS HIMSELF IN A TIGHT PLACE AND EXECUTES A COUNTER
MOVEMENT


"Jacob, here is the boy," said Squire Walker, as he stopped his horse
in front of an old, decayed house.Jacob Wire was at work in his garden, by the side of the house; and
when the squire spoke, he straightened his back, regarding Harry with
a look of mingled curiosity and distrust.He looked as though he would eat too much; and to a
man as mean as Jacob, this was the sum total of all enormities.Besides, the little pauper had earned a bad reputation within the
preceding twenty-four hours, and his new master glanced uneasily at
his barn, and then at the boy, as though he deemed it unsafe to have
such a desperate character about his premises."He is a hard boy, Jacob, and will need a little taming.They fed him
too high at the poorhouse," continued the squire."That spoils boys," replied Jacob, solemnly."So, this is the boy that burnt your barn?"Perhaps he
knew about it, though;" and the squire proceeded to give his
brother-in-law the particulars of the informal examination; for Jacob
Wire, who could hardly afford to lie still on Sundays, much less other
days, had not been up to the village to hear the news."You must be pretty sharp with him," said the overseer, in conclusion."Keep your eye on him all the time, for we may want him again, as soon
as they can catch the other boy."Jacob promised to do the best he could with Harry, who, during the
interview, had maintained a sullen silence; and the squire departed,
assured that he had done his whole duty to the public and to the
little pauper."Well, boy, it is about sundown now, and I guess we will go in and get
some supper before we do any more.But let me tell you beforehand, you
must walk pretty straight here, or you will fare hard."Harry vouchsafed no reply to this speech, and followed Jacob into the
house.His first meal at his new place confirmed all he had heard
about the penuriousness of his master.There was very little to eat on
the table, but Mrs.Wire gave him the poorest there was--a hard crust
of brown bread, a cold potato, and a dish of warm water with a very
little molasses and milk in it, which he was expected to imagine was
tea.He was too sad and depressed, and
probably if the very best had been set before him he would have been
equally indifferent.He ate very little, and Jacob felt more kindly towards him than before
this proof of the smallness of his appetite.He had been compelled to
get rid of his last boy, because he was a little ogre, and it seemed
as though he would eat him out of house and home.After supper Harry assisted Jacob about the barn, and it was nearly
eight o'clock before they finished."Now, boy, it is about bed time, and I will show you your rooms, if
you like," said Jacob."Before you go, let me tell you it won't do any
good to try to run away from here, for I am going to borrow Leman's
bull-dog."Harry made no reply to this remark, and followed his master to the low
attic of the house, where he was pointed to a rickety bedstead, which
he was to occupy."There, jump into bed afore I carry the candle off," continued Jacob.You needn't wait," replied Harry, as he
slipped off his shoes and stockings."That is right; boys always ought to be learnt to go to bed in the
dark," added Jacob, as he departed.But Harry was determined not to go to bed in the dark; so, as soon as
he heard Jacob's step on the floor below, he crept to the stairway,
and silently descended.He had made up his mind not to wait for the
bull-dog.Pausing in the entry, he heard Jacob tell his wife that he
was going over to Leman's to borrow his dog; he was afraid the boy
would get up in the night and set his barn on fire, or run away.Jacob
then left the house, satisfied, no doubt, that the bull-dog would be
an efficient sentinel while the family were asleep.After allowing time enough to elapse for Jacob to reach Leman's house,
he softly opened the front door and went out.Wire was as "deaf as a post," or his suddenly matured plan
to "try again" might have been a failure.As it was, his departure was
not observed.It was quite dark, and after he had got a short distance
from the house, he felt a reasonable degree of security.His first purpose was to get as far away from Redfield as possible
before daylight should come to betray him; and, taking the road, he
walked as fast as his legs would carry him towards Boston.Jacob's
house was on the turnpike, which was the direct road to the city, and
the distance which the squire had carried him in his wagon was so much
clear gain.The sky was overshadowed with
clouds, so that he could not see any stars, and the future did not
look half so bright as his fancy had pictured it on the preceding
night.But he was free again; and free under more favorable
circumstances than before.This time he was himself commander of the
expedition, and was to suffer for no one's bad generalship but his
own.Besides, the experience he had obtained was almost a guarantee of
success.It had taught him the necessity of care and prudence.The moral lesson he had learned was of infinitely more value than even
the lesson of policy.For the first time in his life he was conscious
of a deep and earnest desire to be a good boy, and to become a true
man.As he walked along, he thought more of being a good man than of
being a rich man.It was very natural for him to do so, under the
circumstances, for he had come very near being punished as an
incendiary.The consequences of doing wrong were just then strongly
impressed upon his mind, and he almost shuddered to think he had
consented to remain with Ben Smart after he knew that he burned the
barn.Ah, it was an exceedingly fortunate thing for him that he had
got rid of Ben as he did.For two hours he walked as fast as he could, pausing now and then to
listen for the sound of any approaching vehicle.Possibly Jacob might
have gone to his room, or attic, to see if he was safe, and his escape
had been discovered.He could not be too wary, and every sound that
reached his waiting ear caused his heart to jump with anxiety.It was not the Redfield clock, and it
was evident that he was approaching Rockville, a factory village eight
miles from his native place.He was
exhausted by the labors and the excitement of the day and night, and
his strength would hardly hold out till he should get beyond the
village.Seating himself on a rock by the side of the road, he decided to hold
a council of war, to determine what should be done.If he went
forward, his strength might fail him at the time when a vigorous
effort should be required of him.Somebody's dog might bark, and bring
the "Philistines upon him."He might meet some late walker, who would
detain him.It was hardly safe for him to go through the village by
night or day, after the search which had been made for Ben Smart.People would be on the lookout, and it would be no hard matter to
mistake him for the other fugitive.On the other hand, he did not like to pause so near Redfield.He had
scarcely entered upon the consideration of this side of the question
before his quick ear detected the sound of rattling wheels in the
direction from which he had come.It was
Squire Walker and Jacob Wire, he was sure, in pursuit of him; but his
courage did not fail him.Leaping over the stone wall by the side of the road, he secured the
only retreat which the vicinity afforded, and waited, with his heart
in his throat, for the coming of his pursuers, as he had assured
himself they were.The present seemed to be his only chance of escape,
and if he failed now, he might not soon have another opportunity to
"try again."The vehicle was approaching at a furious pace, and as the noise grew
more distinct, his heart leaped the more violently.He thought he
recognized the sound of Squire Walker's wagon.There was not much time
for his fancy to conjure up strange things, for the carriage soon
reached the place where he was concealed.said a big bull-dog, placing his ugly nose against the
wall, behind which Harry was lying.added a voice, which the trembling fugitive recognized as that
of George Leman."The dog has scented him," said another--that of Jacob Wire.Harry's heart sank within him, and he felt as faint as though every
drop of blood had been drawn from his veins."I knew the dog would fetch him," said George Leman, as he leaped from
the wagon, followed by Jacob Wire.In obedience to this command, Tiger drew back a few steps, and then
leaped upon the top of the wall.The prospect of being torn to pieces
by the bull-dog was not pleasant to Harry, and with a powerful effort
he summoned his sinking energies for the struggle before him.Grasping
two large stones, he stood erect as the dog leaped on the wall.Inspired by the imminence of his peril, he hurled one of the stones at
Tiger the instant he showed his ugly visage above the fence.The
missile took effect upon the animal, and he was evidently much
astonished at this unusual mode of warfare.Tiger was vanquished, and
fell back from the wall, howling with rage and pain.exclaimed Leman, as he jumped over
the wall.Harry did not wait any longer, but took to his heels, followed by both
pursuers, though not by the dog, which was _hors de combat_.Our hero
was in a "tight place," but with a heroism worthy the days of
chivalry, he resolved not to be captured.He had not run far, however, before he realized that George Leman was
more than a match for him, especially in his present worn-out
condition.He was almost upon him, when Harry executed a counter
movement, which was intended to "outflank" his adversary.Dodging
round a large rock in the field, he redoubled his efforts, running now
towards the road where the horse was standing.Leman was a little
confused by this sudden action, and for an instant lost ground.Harry reached the road and leaped the wall at a single bound; it was a
miracle that, in the darkness, he had not dashed his brains out upon
the rocks, in the reckless leap.The horse was startled by the noise,
and his snort suggested a brilliant idea to Harry.he shouted; and the horse started towards Rockville at a
round pace.Harry jumped into the wagon over the hind board, and grasping the
reins, put the high-mettled animal to the top of his speed.The horse manifested no feeling of partiality toward either of the
parties, and seemed as willing to do his best for Harry as for his
master.shouted George Leman, astounded at the new phase which
the chase had assumed.It was natural that he should prefer to let
the fugitive escape, to the alternative of losing his horse.George
Leman was noted for three things in Redfield--his boat, his ugly dog,
and his fast horse; and Harry, after stealing the boat and killing the
dog, was in a fair way to deprive him of his horse, upon which he set
a high value.The boy seemed like his evil genius, and no doubt he was
angry with himself for letting so mean a man as Jacob Wire persuade
him to hunt down such small game.Harry did not deem it prudent to stop, and in a few moments had left
his pursuers out of sight.He had
played a desperate game, and won the victory; yet he did not feel like
indulging in a triumph.The battle had been a bitter necessity, and he
even regretted the fate of poor Tiger, whose ribs he had stove in with
a rock.All was still, save the roaring of the
waters at the dam, and no one challenged him."I am safe, at any rate," said he to himself, when he had passed the
village."What will be the next scrape, I wonder?They
will have me up for stealing a horse next.George Leman is a good fellow, and only for the fun of the thing, he
wouldn't have come out on such a chase.Harry hauled up by the roadside, and fastened the horse to the fence."There, George, you can have your horse again; but I will just put the
blanket over him, for he is all of a reeking sweat.It will just show
George, when he comes up, that I don't mean him any harm.Taking the blanket which lay in the bottom of the wagon (for George
Leman was very careful of his horse, and though it was October, always
covered him when he let him stand out at night), he spread it over
him."Now, for Number One again," muttered Harry."I must take to the
woods, though I doubt if George will follow me any farther."So saying, he got over the fence, and made his way across the fields
to the woods, which were but a short distance from the road.CHAPTER VIII

IN WHICH HARRY KILLS A BIG SNAKE, AND MAKES A NEW FRIEND


Harry was not entirely satisfied with what he had done.He regretted
the necessity which had compelled him to take George Leman's horse.It
looked too much like stealing; and his awakened moral sense repelled
the idea of such a crime.But they could not accuse him of stealing
the horse; for his last act would repudiate the idea.His great resolution to become a good and true man was by no means
forgotten.It is true, at the very outset of the new life he had
marked out for himself, he had been obliged to behave like a young
ruffian, or be restored to his exacting guardians.It was rather a bad
beginning; but he had taken what had appeared to him the only course.On the solution of this problem
depended the moral character of the subsequent acts.If it was right
for him to run away, why, of course it was right for him to resist
those who attempted to restore him to Jacob Wire.Harry made up his mind that it was right for him to run away, under
the circumstances.His new master had been charged to break him
down--even to starve him down.Jacob's reputation as a mean and hard
man was well merited; and it was his duty to leave without stopping to
say good by.I do not think that Harry was wholly in the right, though I dare say
all my young readers will sympathize with the stout-hearted little
hero.So far, Jacob Wire had done him no harm.He had suffered no
hardship at his hands.All his misery was in the future; and if he had
stayed, perhaps his master might have done well by him, though it is
not probable.Still, I think Harry was in some sense justifiable.To
remain in such a place was to cramp his soul, as well as pinch his
body--to be unhappy, if not positively miserable.He might have tried
the place, and when he found it could not be endured, fled from it.It must be remembered that Harry was a pauper and an orphan.He had
not had the benefit of parental instruction.It was not from the home
of those whom God had appointed to be his guardians and protectors
that he had fled; it was from one who regarded him, not as a rational
being, possessed of an immortal soul--one for whose moral, mental, and
spiritual welfare he was accountable before God--that he had run away,
but from one who considered him as a mere machine, from which it was
his only interest to get as much work at as little cost as possible.He fled from a taskmaster, not from one who was in any just sense a
guardian.Harry did not reason out all this; he only felt it.What did they care
about his true welfare?Harry so understood it, and acted
accordingly.But his heart was
stout; and the events of the last chapter inspired him with confidence
in his own abilities.He entered the dark woods, and paused to rest
himself.While he was discussing this question in his own mind he heard the
sound of voices on the road, which was not more than fifty rods
distant.In a few minutes he heard
the sound of wagon wheels; and soon had the satisfaction of knowing
that his pursuers had abandoned the chase and were returning home.The little fugitive was very tired and very sleepy.It was not
possible for him to continue his journey, and he looked about him for
a place in which to lodge.The night was chilly and damp; and as he
sat upon the rock, he shivered with cold.It would be impossible to
sleep on the wet ground; and if he could, it might cost him his life.It was a pine forest; and there were no leaves on the ground, so that
he could not make such a bed as that in which he had slept the
previous night.He was so cold that he was obliged to move about to get warm.It
occurred to him that he might get into some barn in the vicinity, and
nestle comfortably in the hay; but the risk of being discovered was
too great, and he directed his steps towards the depths of the forest.After walking some distance, he came to an open place in the woods.The character of the growth had changed, and the ground was covered
with young maples, walnuts and oaks.The wood had been recently cut
off over a large area, but there were no leaves of which he could make
a bed.Fortune favored him, however; for, after advancing half way across the
open space he reached one of those cabins erected for the use of men
employed to watch coal pits.It was made of board slabs, and covered
with sods.Near it was the circular place on which the coal pit had
burned.At the time of which I write, charcoal was carried to Boston from many
towns within thirty miles of the city.Perhaps my young readers may
never have seen a coal pit.The wood is set up on the ends of the
sticks, till a circular pile from ten to twenty feet in diameter is
formed and two tiers in height.Its shape is that of a cone, or a
sugar loaf.Fire is
communicated to the wood, so that it shall smoulder, or burn slowly,
without blazing.Just enough air is admitted to the pit to keep the
fire alive.If the air were freely admitted the pile would burn to
ashes.Sometimes the outer covering of dirt and sods falls in, as the
wood shrinks permitting the air to rush in and fan the fire to a
blaze.When this occurs, the aperture must be closed, or the wood
would be consumed; and it is necessary to watch it day and night.The
cabin had been built for the comfort of the men who did this duty.Harry's heart was filled with gratitude when he discovered the rude
hut.If it had been a palace, it could not have been a more welcome
retreat.It is true the stormy wind had broken down the door, and the
place was no better than a squirrel hole; yet it suggested a thousand
brilliant ideas of comfort, and luxury even, to our worn-out and
hunted fugitive.The floor was covered with straw, which
completed his ideal of a luxurious abode.Raising up the door, which
had fallen to the ground, he placed it before the aperture--thus
excluding the cold air from his chamber."I'm a lucky fellow," exclaimed Harry, as he threw himself on the
straw."This place will be a palace beside Jacob Wire's house.And I
can stay here a month, if I like."Nestling closely under the side of the hut, he pulled the straw over
him, and soon began to feel perfectly at home.The commissary department of the establishment could not
be relied on.There were no pork and potatoes in the house, no
well-filled grain chest, no groceries, not even a rill of pure water
at hand.This was an unpromising state of things; and he began to see
that there would be no fun in living in the woods, where the butcher
and the baker would not be likely to visit him.There
were rabbits, partridges, and quails in the woods; he might set a
snare, and catch some of them.But he had no fire to cook them; and
Dr.Kane had not then demonstrated the healthy and appetizing
qualities of raw meat.The orchards in the neighborhood were
accessible; but prudence seemed to raise an impassable barrier between
him and them.While he was thus considering these matters, he dropped asleep, and
forgot all about his stomach.He was completely exhausted; and no
doubt the owls and bats were astonished as they listened to the
sonorous sounds that came from the deserted cabin.The birds sang their mating songs on the
tree tops; but he heard them not.The sun rose, and penetrated the
chinks of the hut; but the little wanderer still slumbered.The
Rockville clock struck nine; and he heard it not.I think it was Harry's grumbling stomach that finally waked him; and
it was no wonder that neglected organ grew impatient under the injury
put upon it, for Harry had eaten little or nothing since his dinner at
the poorhouse on the preceding day.Jumping out of the heap of straw in which he had "cuddled" all night
scarcely without moving, he left the hut to reconnoitre his position.So far as security was concerned, it seemed to be a perfectly safe
place.He could see nothing of the village of Rockville, though,
beyond the open space, he saw the top of a chimney; but it was at
least half a mile distant.Just then he did not feel much interested in the scenery and natural
advantages of the position.His stomach was imperative, and he was
faint from the want of food.Berry time was past; and the prospect of supplying his wants was very
discouraging.Leaving the cabin, he walked towards the distant chimney
that peered above the tree tops.It belonged to a house that "was set
on a hill, and could not be hid."After going a little way, he came to a cart path, which led towards
the house.This he followed, descending a hill into a swamp, which was
covered over with alders and birches.At the foot of the declivity he
heard the rippling of waters; but the bushes concealed the stream from
his view.He had descended nearly to the foot of the hill when the sound of
footsteps reached his ears.His heart beat quick with apprehension,
and he paused to listen.The step was soft and light; it was not a
man's, and his courage rose.Pat, pat, pat, went the steps on the
leafy ground, so gently that his fears were conquered; for the person
could be only a child.Suddenly a piercing shriek saluted his ears.Something had occurred to
alarm the owner of the fairy feet which made the soft pat, pat, on the
ground.Another shriek, and Harry bounded down the road like an
antelope, heedless of the remonstrances of his grumbling stomach.shouted a voice, which Harry perceived was that of a
little girl.In a moment more he discovered the young lady running with all her
might towards him.But Harry had scarcely asked the question before he saw what had
alarmed her.Under other circumstances he would have quailed himself;
for, as he spoke, a great black snake raised his head two or three
feet from the ground directly in front of him.He was an ugly-looking
monster, and evidently intended to attack him.All the chivalry of
Harry's nature was called up to meet the emergency of the occasion.Seizing a little stick that lay in the path, he struck sundry
vigorous blows at the reptile, which, however, seemed only to madden,
without disabling him.Several times he elevated his head from the
ground to strike at his assailant; but the little knight was an old
hand with snakes, and vigorously repelled his assaults.At last, he
struck a blow which laid out his snakeship; and the field was won,
when Harry had smashed his head with a large rock.The reptile was
about four feet and a half long, and as big round as a small boy's
wrist."There, miss, he won't hurt you now," said Harry, panting with his
exertions.The little girl ventured to approach the dead body of the snake, and
satisfied herself that he could not harm her.I was crossing the brook at the foot of the hill,
when he sprang out from beneath my feet and chased me.I never was so
frightened in all my life," said the little miss.asked she, with
childish simplicity.Harry did not like to answer that question, and made no reply."No; I used to live in Redfield."The little girl wanted to laugh then, it seemed such a funny answer.But, little girl, I don't want you to tell any one that
you have seen me.asked the maiden, with a stare of
astonishment.I am a poor boy, and have run away from a hard
master."How lucky that I have lots of goodies in my basket!""I haven't eat anything since yesterday noon," replied Harry, as he
took a handful of doughnuts she handed him."Sit down on this rock, and do eat all you want.I never knew what it
was to be very hungry."Harry seated himself, and proceeded to devour the food the
sympathizing little maiden had given him, while she looked on with
astonishment and delight as he voraciously consumed cake after cake,
without seeming to produce any effect upon the "abhorred vacuum."CHAPTER IX

IN WHICH HARRY BREAKFASTS ON DOUGHNUTS, AND FINDS THAT ANGELS DO NOT
ALWAYS HAVE WINGS


Harry was very hungry, and the little girl thought he would never have
eaten enough.Since he had told her he had run away, she was deeply
interested in him, and had a hundred questions to ask; but she did not
wish to bother him while he was eating, he was so deeply absorbed in
the occupation.laughed she, as Harry leveled on
the sixth cake."I never thought much of them before, but I never
shall see a doughnut again without thinking of you."Our hero was perfectly willing to believe that doughnuts were a very
beneficent institution; but just then he was too busily occupied to be
sentimental over them.asked Harry as he crammed half of
the cake into his mouth."I have a great mind not to tell you, because you wouldn't tell me
what yours is," replied she, roguishly.I have run away from--well, from
somewhere."But, as you killed
the snake, I shall tell you."Mine is Harry West," replied he, unable to resist the little lady's
argument."You must not tell any one about me for three days, for then
I shall be out of the way."They say that none but bad boys run away.I hope you are not
a bad boy.""I don't think you are, either."It was a hearty endorsement, and Harry's heart warmed as she spoke.The little maiden was not more than nine or ten years old, but she
seemed to have some skill in reading faces; at least, Harry thought
she had.Whatever might be said of himself, he was sure she was a good
girl.In short, though Harry had never read a novel in his life, she
was a little angel, even if she had no wings.He even went so far as
to believe she was a little angel, commissioned by that mysterious
something, which wiser and more devout persons would have called a
special providence, to relieve his wants with the contents of her
basket, and gladden his heart by the sunshine of her sweet smile.There is something in goodness which always finds its way to the face.It makes little girls look prettier than silks, and laces, and
ribbons, and embroidery.Harry
thought so; but very likely it was the doughnuts and her kind words
which constituted her beauty."I am pretty sure I am not a bad boy," continued Harry; "but I will
tell you my own story, and you shall judge for yourself.""You will tell me all of it--won't you?""To be sure I will," replied Harry, a little tartly, for he
misapprehended Julia's meaning.He thought she was afraid he would not tell his wrong acts; whereas
her deep interest in him rendered her anxious to have the whole, even
to the smallest particulars.I do so love to hear a good story!""You shall have it all; but where were you going?"I was going to carry these doughnuts to Mrs.She is a poor
widow, who lives over the back lane.She has five children, and has
very hard work to get along.added Harry, who could understand and
appreciate kindness to the poor.Lane says I am," replied Julia,
with a blush."Aunty Gray, over to the poorhouse, used to call everybody an angel
that brought her anything good.I am dying to hear your story," interposed
Julia, as she seated herself on another rock, near that occupied by
Harry."Here goes, then"; and Harry proceeded with his tale, commencing back
beyond his remembrance with the traditionary history which had been
communicated to him by Mr.When he came to the period of authentic history, or that which was
stored up in his memory, he grew eloquent, and the narrative glowed
with the living fire of the hero.Julia was quite as much interested
as Desdemona in the story of the swarthy Moor.His "round, unvarnished
tale," adorned only with the flowers of youthful simplicity, enchained
her attention, and she "loved him for the dangers he had passed;"
loved him, not as Desdemona loved, but as a child loves.She was sure
now that he was not a bad boy; that even a good boy might do such a
thing as run away from cruel and exacting guardians.How near you came to being drowned in
the river!And then they wanted
to send you to prison for setting the barn afire!"exclaimed Julia,
when he had finished the story."I came pretty near it; that's a fact!"replied Harry, warming under
the approbation of his partial auditor."I don't know; I hope I didn't."But what are you going to do next,
Harry?""What will you do when you get there?""You are not big enough to work much."For some time longer they discussed Harry's story, and Julia regretted
the necessity of leaving him to do her errand at Mrs.She
promised to see him when she returned, and Harry walked down to the
brook to get a drink, while she continued on her way.Our hero was deeply interested in the little girl.Like the "great
guns" in the novels, he was sure she was no ordinary character.He was
fully satisfied in relation to the providential nature of their
meeting.She had been sent by that incomprehensible something to
furnish him with food, and he trembled when he thought what might have
happened if she had not come."I can't be a very bad boy," thought he, "or she would not have liked
me.Nason used to say he could tell an ugly horse by the looks of
his eye; and the schoolmaster last winter picked out all the bad boys
at a glance.I can't be a very bad boy, or she would have found me
out.I _know_ I am not a bad boy.I feel right, and try to do right."Harry's investigation invested Julia Bryant with a thousand poetical
excellences.That she felt an interest in him--one so good as she--was
enough to confirm all the noble resolutions he had made, and give him
strength to keep them; and as he seated himself by the brook, he
thought over his faults, and renewed his determination to uproot them
from his character.His meeting with the "little angel," as he chose
to regard her, was an oasis in the desert--a place where his moral
nature could drink the pure waters of life.No one had ever before seemed to care much whether he was a good boy
or a bad boy.The minister used now and then to give him a dry
lecture; but he did not seem to feel any real interest in him.He was
minister, and of course he must preach; not that he cared whether a
pauper boy was a saint or a sinner, but only to do the work he was
hired to do, and earn his money.Her sweet face was the "beauty of holiness."She
hoped he was not a bad boy.She liked a good boy; and this was
incentive enough to incur a lifetime of trial and self-sacrifice.To have one feel an interest in his moral
welfare, to have one wish him to be a good boy, had not grown stale by
long continuance.He had known no anxious mother, who wished him to be
good, who would weep when he did wrong.The sympathy of the little
angel touched a sensitive chord in his heart and soul, and he felt
that he should go forward in the great pilgrimage of life with a new
desire to be true to himself, and true to her who had inspired his
reverence.Even a child cannot be good without having it felt by others."She
hoped he was not a bad boy," were the words of the little angel; and
before she returned from her errand of mercy, he repeated them to
himself a hundred times.They were a talisman to him, and he was sure
he should never be a bad boy in the face of such a wish.He wandered about the woods for two or three hours, impatient for the
return of the little rural goddess who had taken possession of his
thoughts, and filled his soul with admiration.She came at last, and
glad was the welcome which he gave her."I have been thinking of you ever since I left you," said Julia, as
she approached the place where he had been waiting her return."I hope you didn't think of me as a bad boy," replied he, giving
expression to that which was uppermost in his mind.I am sure you must be a good boy.""I am glad you think so; and that will help me be a good boy.""I never had any one to care whether I was good or bad.If you do, you
will be the first one."She had a father and mother who loved her,
and prayed for her every day.It seemed hard that poor Harry should
have no mother to love him as her mother loved her; to watch over him
day and night, to take care of him when he was sick, and, above all,
to teach him to be good.She pitied the lonely orphan, and would
gladly have taken him to her happy home, and shared with him all she
had, even the love of her mother."But I have been thinking of something," she
added, in more sprightly tones."If you would only let me tell my father that you are here--"

"Not for the world!""O, I won't say a word, unless you give me leave; but my father is
rich.He owns a great factory and a great farm.He has lots of men to
work for him; and my father is a very good man, too.People will do as
he wants them to do, and if you will let me tell him your story, he
will go over to Redfield and make them let you stay at our house.You
shall be my brother then, and we can do lots of things together."I don't think it would be safe.I know Squire Walker wouldn't let me
go to any place where they would use me well.""No; I think I will go on to Boston.""You will have a very hard time of it.""If they do, I shall try again.""If they do catch you, will you let my father know it?He will be your
friend, for my friends are his friends."I should be very glad to have such a friend."said Julia, as Harry heard the distant
sound.I may never see you again," added Harry, sadly.When you get big you must come to
Rockville.""You will not wish to see the little poorhouse boy, then."I shall always be glad to see the boy that killed that
snake!But I shall come up after dinner, and bring you something to
eat."Suppose she asks me what I am going to do with the dinner I shall
bring you?I would rather not have any dinner than have
_you_ tell a lie."Harry would not always have been so nice about a lie; but for the
little angel to tell a falsehood, why, it seemed like mud on a white
counterpane."I won't tell a lie, but you shall have your dinner.Harry watched the retreating form of his kind friend, till she
disappeared beyond the curve of the path, and his blessing went with
her.CHAPTER X

IN WHICH HARRY FARES SUMPTUOUSLY, AND TAKES LEAVE OF THE LITTLE ANGEL


When Harry could no longer see the little angel, he fixed his eyes
upon the ground, and continued to think of her.It is not every day
that a pauper boy sees an angel, or even one whom the enthusiasm of
the imagination invests with angelic purity and angelic affections.In the records of individual experience, as well as in the history of
the world, there are certain points of time which are rendered
memorable by important events.By referring to a chronological table,
the young reader will see the great events which have marked the
progress of civilized nations from the lowest depths of barbarism up
to their present enlightened state.Every individual, if he had the
requisite wisdom, could make up a list of epochs in his own
experience.Perhaps he would attach too little importance to some
things, too much to others; for we cannot always clearly perceive the
influences which assist in forming the character.Some trivial event,
far back in the past, which inspired him with a new reverence for
truth and goodness, may be forgotten.The memory may not now cherish
the look, the smile of approbation, which strengthened the heart, when
it was struggling against the foe within; but its influence was none
the less potent."It is the last pound which breaks the camel's back;"
and that look, that smile, may have closed the door of the heart
against a whole legion of evil spirits, and thus turned a life of woe
and bitterness into a life of sunshine and happiness.There are hundreds of epochs in the experience of every person, boy or
man--events which raised him up or let him down in the scale of moral
existence.Harry West had now reached one of these epochs in his
pilgrimage.To meet a little girl in the woods, to kill a black snake, and thus
relieve her from a terrible fright, to say the least, was not a great
event, as events are reckoned in the world; yet it was destined to
exert a powerful influence upon his future career.It was not the
magnitude of the deed performed, or the chivalrous spirit which called
it forth, that made this a memorable event to Harry; it was the angel
visit--the kindling influence of a pure heart that passed from her to
him.But I suppose the impatient reader will not thank me for
moralizing over two whole pages, and I leave the further application
of the moral to the discretion of my young friends.Harry felt strangely--more strangely than he had ever felt before.As
he walked back to the cabin everything seemed to have assumed a new
appearance.Somehow the trees did not look as they used to look.His being seemed to have undergone a
change.He could not account for it; perhaps he did not try.He entered the cabin; and, without dropping the train of thought which
Julia's presence suggested, he busied himself in making the place more
comfortable.He shook up the straw, and made his bed, stuffed dried
grass into the chinks and crannies in the roof, fastened the door up
with some birch withes, and replaced some of the stones of the chimney
which had fallen down.This work occupied him for nearly two hours,
though, so busy were his thoughts, they seemed not more than half an
hour.He had scarcely finished these necessary repairs before he heard the
light step of her who fed him, as Elijah was fed by the ravens, for it
seemed like a providential supply.She saw him at the door of the
cabin; and she no longer dallied with a walk, but ran with all her
might."O, Harry, I am so glad!"she cried, out of breath, as she handed him
a little basket, whose contents were carefully covered with a piece of
brown paper.asked Harry, smiling from sympathy with her."I have heard all about it; and I am so glad you are a good boy!"exclaimed she, panting like a pretty fawn which had gamboled its
breath away."Father has seen and talked with--who was he?"How could he tell whom her father had seen and talked
with?"The man that owned the dog, and the horse and the boat."George Leman," replied Harry, now deeply interested in the little
maiden's story.But I have brought you some dinner; and while you
are eating it, I will tell you all about it.Come, there is a nice big
rock--that shall be your table."Julia, full of excitement, seized the basket, and ran to the rock, a
little way from the cabin.Pulling off half a dozen great oak leaves
from a shrub, she placed them on the rock."Here is a piece of meat, Harry, on this plate," she continued,
putting it on an oak leaf; "here is a piece of pie; here is some bread
and butter; here is cheese; and here is a piece of cold apple pudding."Never mind the sauce," said Harry; and he could hardly keep from
bursting into tears, as he saw how good the little angel was.It seemed as though she could not have been more an angel, if she had
had a pair of wings.The radiant face was there; the pure and loving
heart was there; all was there but the wings, and he could easily
imagine them.He was not much
accustomed to such luxuries; but just then he did not appreciate the
sumptuousness of the feast, for it was eclipsed by the higher
consideration of the devotion of the giver."So am I. If you feed me as high as this, I shall want to stay here a
good while.""Only to-day; to-morrow I must be moving towards Boston.""I was hoping you would stay here a good long while.I shall be so
pleased to bring you your breakfast, and dinner, and supper every
day!""I don't know why he shouldn't.You are not very hungry; you don't eat
as you did this morning."Tell me, now, what your father said, Julia.""He saw George Leman; and he told him how you tied his horse to the
fence, and how careful you were to put the blanket on him, so that he
shouldn't catch cold after his hard run.That was very kind of you,
Harry, when you knew they were after you.Father said almost any one
would have run the horse till he dropped down.That one thing showed
that you were not a bad boy.""I wouldn't have injured George Leman for anything," added Harry."He's a good fellow, and never did me any harm.""He said, when he found his horse, he was so glad he wouldn't have
chased you any farther for all the world.Nason said about you--that you were a good boy, had good feelings, and
were willing to work.He didn't blame you for not wanting to go to
Jacob Wire's--wasn't that the man?""And he didn't blame you for running away.Nobody believes that you
set the barn afire; and, Harry, they have caught the other boy--Ben
Smart, wasn't it?""They caught him in the woods, over the other side of the river.""Did you find out whether the dog was killed?"Leman said he thought he would get over it; and he has got his
boat again.""I am glad of that; and if anybody ever catches me with such a fellow
as Ben Smart again, they'll know it.""You can't think how I wanted to tell father where you were, when he
spoke so well of you.He even said he hoped you would get off, and
that you must be in the woods around here somewhere.You will let me
tell him now--won't you, Harry?""He may hope I will get off, and still not be willing to help me off."Julia looked very much disappointed; for she had depended upon
surprising her father with the story of the snake, and the little
fugitive in the woods."He will be very good to you," pleaded she."I dare say he would; but he may think it his duty to send me back to
Redfield; and Squire Walker would certainly make me go to Jacob
Wire's.""I'm afraid you will never get to Boston."I don't think it is safe for me to stay here much
longer."Hardly any one ever goes through the woods here at this time
of year but myself.""Didn't your mother want to know what you were going to do with the
dinner you brought me?""No, I went to the store room, and got it.She didn't see me; but I
don't like to do anything unknown to her.""You have brought enough to last me while I stop here.To-morrow
morning I must start; so I suppose I shall not see you again.But I
shall never forget you," said Harry looking as sad as he felt."No, you mustn't go off without any breakfast.Promise me you will not
go till I have brought you some."Harry assured Julia he had enough, and tried to persuade her not to
bring him any more food; but Julia was resolute, and he was obliged to
promise.Having finished his dinner, she gathered up the remnants of
the feast and put them in the cabin for his supper.She was afraid to
remain any longer, lest she might be missed at home and Harry
gallantly escorted her beyond the brook on her return home.He busied himself during the greater part of the afternoon in
gathering dry grass and dead leaves for the improvement of his bed in
the cabin.About an hour before sundown, he was surprised to receive
another visit from Julia Bryant.She had her little basket in one
hand, and in the other she carried a little package."I didn't expect to see you again," said Harry, as she approached."I don't know as you will like what I have done," she began timidly;
"but I did it for the best.""I shall like anything you have done," answered Harry promptly, "even
if you should send me back to Redfield.""I wouldn't do such a mean thing as that; but I have told somebody
that you are here.""You will forgive me if I have done wrong--won't you?"He mistook her anxious appearance for sorrow at
what she had done.He could not give her pain; so he told her that,
whatever she had done, she was forgiven.He drives the baggage wagon that goes to
Boston every week.He promised not to lisp a word to a single soul,
and he would be your friend for my sake.""Well, you see, I was afraid you would never get to Boston; and I
thought what a nice thing it would be if you could only ride all the
way there with John Lane.John likes me because I carry things to his
mother, and I am sure he won't tell.""I may forget everybody
else in the world; but I shall never forget you."A tear moistened his eye, as he uttered his enthusiastic declaration."The worst of it is, John starts at two o'clock--right in the middle
of the night.""So much the better," replied Harry, wiping away the tear."You will take the wagon on the turnpike, where the cart path comes
out."I am sorry to have you go; for I like you, Harry.You will be a very
good boy, when you get to Boston; for they say the city is a wicked
place.""There are a great many temptations there, people say.""I shall try to be as good as you are," replied Harry, who could
imagine nothing better."If I fail once, I shall try again.""Here, Harry, I have brought you a good book--the best of all books.I
have written your name and mine in it; and I hope you will keep it and
read it as long as you live.Harry took the package, and thanked her for it."I never read the Bible much; but I shall read this for your sake.""No, Harry; read it for your own sake.""How I shall long to hear from you!Won't you write me a few lines, now and then, to let me know how
you prosper, and whether you are good or not?"I can't write much; but I suppose I can--"

"Never mind how you write, if I can only read it."The sun had gone down, and the dark shadows of night were gathering
over the forest when they parted, but a short distance from Mr.With the basket which contained provisions for his
journey and the Bible in his hand, he returned to the hut, to get what
sleep he might before the wagon started.CHAPTER XI

IN WHICH HARRY REACHES THE CITY, AND THOUGH OFTEN DISAPPOINTED, TRIES
AGAIN


Harry entered the cabin, and stretched himself on his bed of straw and
leaves; but the fear that he should not wake in season to take the
wagon at the appointed place, would scarcely permit him to close his
eyes.He had not yet made up for the sleep he had lost; and Nature,
not sharing his misgiving, at last closed and sealed his eyelids.It would be presumptuous for me to attempt to inform the reader what
Harry dreamed about on that eventful night; but I can guess that it
was about angels, about bright faces and sweet smiles, and that they
were very pleasant dreams.At any rate, he slept very soundly, as
tired boys are apt to sleep, even when they are anxious about getting
up early in the morning.He woke, at last, with a start; for with his first consciousness came
the remembrance of the early appointment.He sprang from his bed, and
threw down the door of the cabin.It was still dark; the stars
twinkled above, the owls screamed, and the frogs sang merrily around
him.He had no means of ascertaining the time of night.It might be
twelve; it might be four; and his uncertainty on this point filled him
with anxiety.Better too early than too late; and grasping the basket
and the Bible, which were to be the companions of his journey, he
hastened down the cart path to the turnpike.There was no sound of approaching wheels to cheer him, and the clock
in the meeting house at Rockville obstinately refused to strike.He
reached the designated place; there was no wagon there.The thought filled him with chagrin; and he was reading
himself a very severe lesson for having permitted himself to sleep at
all, when the church clock graciously condescended to relieve his
anxiety by striking the hour."One," said he, almost breathless with interest."Two," he repeated, loud enough to be heard, if there had been any one
to hear him."Three"; and he held his breath, waiting for more.he added, with disappointment and chagrin, when it was
certain that the clock did not mean to strike another stroke.Miss Julia will think that I
am a smart fellow, when she finds that her efforts to get me off have
been wasted.I might have known that I should
not wake;" and he stamped his foot upon the ground with impatience.He had been caught napping, and had lost the wagon.He was never so
mortified in his life.One who was so careless did not deserve to
succeed."One thing is clear--it is no use to cry for spilt milk," muttered he,
as he jumped over the fence into the road."I have been stupid, but
try again."Unfortunately, there was no chance to try again.Like thousands of
blessed opportunities, it had passed by, never to return.He had come
at the eleventh hour, and the door was closed against him.With the
wagon it had been "now or never."Harry got over his impatience, and resolved that Julia should not come
to the cabin, the next morning, to find he had slept when the
bridegroom came.He had a pair of legs, and there was the road.It was
no use to "wait for the wagon;" legs were made before wagon wheels;
and he started on the long and weary pilgrimage.He had not advanced ten paces before pleasant sounds reached his ears.A wagon was certainly approaching, and
his heart leaped high with hope.Was it possible that John Lane had
not yet gone?Retracing his steps, he got over the fence at the place
where John was to take him.He had
no right to suppose it was; but he determined to wait till the wagon
had passed.It was a heavy wagon, heavily
loaded, and approached very slowly; but at last it reached the spot
where the impatient boy was waiting.Some lucky accident had detained the
team, and he had regained his opportunity.replied Harry, as he leaped over the fence."You are on hand," added John Lane."I am; but I was sure you had gone.I don't generally get off much before this time," answered
John."Climb up here, and let us be moving on."It was a large wagon, with a sail-cloth cover--one of those regular
baggage wagons which railroads have almost driven out of existence in
Massachusetts.It was drawn by four horses, harnessed two abreast, and
had a high "box" in front for the driver.Harry nimbly climbed upon the box, and took his seat by the side of
John Lane--though that worthy told him he had better crawl under the
cover, where he would find plenty of room to finish his nap on a bale
of goods."I thought likely I should have to go up to the cabin and wake you.Julia told me I must, if you were not on the spot.""I am glad I have saved you that trouble; but Julia said you would
start at two o'clock.""Well, I get off by two or three o'clock.I don't carry the mail, so I
ain't so particular.What do you mean to do when you get to Boston?"John Lane questioned the little wanderer, and drew from him all the
incidents of his past history.He seemed to feel an interest in the
fortunes of his companion, and gave him much good advice on practical
matters, including an insight into life in the city."I suppose Squire Walker would give me fits, if he knew I carried you
off.He was over to Rockville yesterday looking for you.""I hope not, my boy; though I don't know as I should have meddled in
the matter, if Julia hadn't teased me.She is
the best little girl in the world; and you are a lucky fellow to have
such a friend.""I am; she is an angel;" and when Harry began to think of Julia, he
could not think of anything else, and the conversation was suspended.It was a long while before either of them spoke again, and then John
advised Harry to crawl into the wagon and lie down on the load.Notwithstanding his agreeable thoughts, our hero yawned now and then,
and concluded to adopt the suggestion of the driver.He found a very
comfortable bed on the bales, softened by heaps of mattings, which
were to be used in packing the miscellaneous articles of the return
freight.John Lane took things very easily; and as the horses jogged slowly
along, he relieved the monotony of the journey by singing sundry
old-fashioned psalm tunes, which had not then gone out of use.He was
a good singer; and Harry was so pleased with the music, and so
unaccustomed to the heavy jolt of the wagon, that he could not go to
sleep at once."While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
      All seated on the ground,
    The angel of the Lord came down,
      And glory shone around."Again and again John's full and sonorous voice rolled out these
familiar lines, till Harry was fairly lulled to sleep by the
harmonious measures.The angel of the Lord had come down for the
fortieth time, after the manner of the ancient psalmody, and for the
fortieth time Harry had thought of _his_ angel, when he dropped off to
dream of the "glory that shone around."Harry slept soundly after he got a little used to the rough motion of
the wagon, and it was sunrise before he woke."Well, Harry, how do you feel now?"asked John, as he emerged from his
lodging apartment."Better; I feel as bright as a new pin.Pretty soon we shall stop to bait
the team and get some breakfast.""I have got some breakfast in my basket.Julia gave me enough to last
a week.I shan't starve, at any rate.""No one would ever be hungry in this world, if everybody were like
Julia.But you shall breakfast with me at the tavern.""It won't be safe--will it?""O, yes; nobody will know you here.""Well, I have got some money to pay for anything I have.""Keep your money, Harry; you will want it all when you get to Boston."After going a few miles farther, they stopped at a tavern, where the
horses were fed, and Harry ate such a breakfast as a pauper never ate
before.John would not let him pay for it, declaring that Julia's
friends were his friends.The remaining portion of the journey was effected without any incident
worthy of narrating, and they reached the city about noon.Of course
the first sight of Boston astonished Harry.His conceptions of a city
were entirely at fault; and though it was not a very large city
twenty-five years ago, it far exceeded his expectations.Harry had a mission before him, and he did not permit his curiosity to
interfere with that.John drove down town to deliver his load; and
Harry went with him, improving every opportunity to obtain work.When
the wagon stopped, he went boldly into the stores in the vicinity to
inquire if they "wanted to hire a hand."Now, Harry was not exactly in a condition to produce a very favorable
impression upon those to whom he applied for work.His clothes were
never very genteel, nor very artistically cut and made; and they were
threadbare, and patched at the knees and elbows.A patch is no
disguise to a man or boy, it is true; but if a little more care had
been taken to adapt the color and kind of fabric in Harry's patches to
the original garment, his general appearance would undoubtedly have
been much improved.Whether these patches really affected his ultimate
success I cannot say--only that they were an inconvenience at the
outset.It was late in the afternoon before John Lane had unloaded his
merchandise and picked up his return freight.Thus far Harry had been
unsuccessful; no one wanted a boy; or if they did, they did not want
such a boy as Harry appeared to be.His country garb, with the five
broad patches, seemed to interfere with the working out of his
manifest destiny.Spruce clerks and
ill-mannered boys laughed at him; but he did not despond."Try again," exclaimed he, as often as he was told that his services
were not required.When the wagon reached Washington Street, Harry wanted to walk, for
the better prosecution of his object; and John gave him directions so
that he could find Major Phillips's stable, where he intended to put
up for the night.Harry trotted along among the gay and genteel people that thronged the
sidewalk; but he was so earnest about his mission, that he could not
stop to look at their fine clothes, nor even at the pictures, the
gewgaws, and gimcracks that tempted him from the windows."'Boy wanted'" Harry read on a paper in the window of a jeweler's
shop."Now's my time;" and, without pausing to consider the chances
that were against him, he entered the store."You want a boy--don't you?"asked he of a young man behind the
counter."We do," replied the person addressed, looking at the applicant with a
broad grin on his face."I should like to hire out," continued Harry, with an earnestness that
would have secured the attention of any man but an idiot.Your name is Joseph--isn't it?""No, sir; my name is Harry West."The Book says he had a coat of many
colors, though I believe it don't say anything about the trousers,"
sneered the shopkeeper.If you want to hire a boy, I
will do the best I can for you," replied Harry, willing to appreciate
the joke of the other, if he could get a place."You won't answer for us; you come from the country.""You had better go back, and let yourself to some farmer.You will
make a good scarecrow to hang up in the field.No crow would ever come
near you, I'll warrant."Harry's blood boiled with indignation at this gratuitous insult.His
cheeks reddened, and he looked about him for the means of inflicting
summary vengeance upon the poltroon who so wantonly trifled with his
glowing aspirations."Move on, boy; we don't want you," added the man."You are a ----"

I will not write what Harry said.It was a vulgar epithet, coupled
with a monstrous oath for so small a boy to utter.The shopkeeper
sprang out from his counter; but Harry retreated, and escaped him,
though not till he had repeated the vulgar and profane expression.But he was sorry for what he had said before he had gone ten paces."What would the little angel say, if she had heard that?""'Twon't do; I must try again."CHAPTER XII

IN WHICH HARRY SUDDENLY GETS RICH AND HAS A CONVERSATION WITH ANOTHER
HARRY


By the time he reached the stable, Harry would have given almost
anything to have recalled the hasty expressions he had used.He had
acquired the low and vulgar habit of using profane language at the
poorhouse.He was conscious that it was not only wicked to do so, but
that it was very offensive to many persons who did not make much
pretension to piety, or even morality; and, in summing up his faults
in the woods, he had included this habit as one of the worst.She hoped he was a good boy--Julia Bryant, the little angel, hoped so.Her blood would have frozen in her veins if she had listened to the
irreverent words he had uttered in the shop.He had broken his
resolution, broken his promise to the little angel, on the first day
he had been in the city.It was a bad beginning; but instead of
permitting this first failure to do right to discourage him, he
determined to persevere--to try again.A good life, a lofty character, with all the trials and sacrifices
which it demands, is worth working for; and those who mean to grow
better than they are will often be obliged to "try again."The spirit
may be willing to do well, but the flesh is weak, and we are all
exposed to temptation.We may make our good resolutions--and it is
very easy to make them, but when we fail to keep them--it is sometimes
very hard to keep them--we must not be discouraged, but do as Harry
did--TRY AGAIN."Well, Harry, how did you make out?"asked John Lane, when Harry
joined him at the stable."O, well, you will find a place."I don't know what I shall do with you to-night.Every bed in the
tavern up the street, where I stop, is full.I have slept in worse places
than that.""I will fix a place for you, then."After they had prepared his bed, Harry drew out his basket, and
proceeded to eat his supper.He then took a walk down Washington
Street, with John, went to an auction, and otherwise amused himself
till after nine o'clock, when he returned to the stable.After John had left him, as he was walking towards the wagon, with the
intention of retiring for the night, his foot struck against something
which attracted his attention.He kicked it once or twice, to
determine what it was, and then picked it up.he exclaimed; "it is a pocketbook.My fortune is made;"
and without stopping to consider the matter any further, he scrambled
into the wagon.His heart jumped with excitement, for his vivid imagination had
already led him to the conclusion that it was stuffed full of money.It might contain a hundred dollars, perhaps five hundred; and these
sums were about as far as his ideas could reach.He could buy a suit of new clothes, a new cap, new shoes, and be as
spruce as any of the boys he had seen about the city.Then he could go
to a boarding house, and live like a prince, till he could get a place
that suited him; for Harry, however rich he might be, did not think of
living without labor of some kind.He could dress himself up in fine
broadcloth, present himself at the jeweler's shop where they wanted a
boy, and then see whether he would make a good scarecrow.Then his thoughts reverted to the cabin, where he had slept two
nights, and, of course, to the little angel, who had supplied the
commissary department during his sojourn in the woods.He could dress
himself up with the money in the pocketbook, and, after a while, when
he got a place, take the stage for Rockville.Wouldn't she be
astonished to see him then, in fine broadcloth!Wouldn't she walk with
him over to the spot where he had killed the black snake!Wouldn't she
be proud to tell her father that this was the boy she had fed in the
woods!He had promised to write to her when he got
settled, and tell her how he got along, and whether he was good or
not.How glad she would be to hear that he was
getting along so finely!I am sorry to say it, but Harry really felt sad when the thought
occurred to him.He had been building very pretty air castles on this
money, and this reflection suddenly tumbled them all down--new
clothes, new cap, boarding house, visit to Rockville--all in a heap."But I found it," Harry reasoned with himself.Something within him spoke out, saying:

"You stole it, Harry.""No, I didn't; I found it.""If you don't return it to the owner, you will be a thief," continued
the voice within.I dare say the owner does not want
it half so much as I do.""No matter for that, Harry; if you keep it you will be a thief."It was the real Harry,
within the other Harry, that spoke, and he was a very obstinate
fellow, positively refusing to let him keep the pocketbook, at any
rate.She hoped I would be a good boy, and the evil one is
catching me as fast as he can," resumed Harry."Be a good boy," added the other Harry."I mean to be, if I can.""The little angel will be very sad when she finds out that you are a
thief.""I don't mean to be a thief."If she does not, there is One above who will know, and his angels
will frown upon you, and stamp your crime upon your face.Then you
will go about like Cain, with a mark upon you."said the outer Harry, who was sorely tempted by the treasure
within his grasp."You will not dare to look the little angel in the face, if you steal
this money.She will know you are not good, then.Honest folks always
hold their heads up, and are never ashamed to face any person.""Why did I
think of such a thing?"He felt strong then, for the Spirit had triumphed over the Flesh.The
foe within had been beaten back, at least for the moment; and as he
laid his head upon the old coat that was to serve him for a pillow, he
thought of Julia Bryant.He thought he saw her sweet face, and there
was an angelic smile upon it.My young readers will remember, after Jesus had been tempted, and
said, "Get thee behind, Satan," that "behold, angels came and
ministered unto him."They came and ministered to Harry after he had
cast out the evil thought; they come and minister to all who resist
temptation.They come in the heart, and minister with the healing balm
of an approving conscience.Placing the pocketbook under his head, with the intention of finding
the owner in the morning, he went to sleep.The fatigue and excitement
of the day softened his pillow, and not once did he open his eyes till
the toils of another day had commenced around him.I question whether
he would have slept so soundly if he had decided to keep the
pocketbook.He had only been conquered for the
moment--subdued only to attack him again.The first thought of the
treasure, in the morning, was to covet it.Again he allowed his fancy
to picture the comforts and the luxuries which it would purchase."No one will know it," he added."God will know it; you will know it yourself," said the other Harry,
more faithful and conscientious than the outside Harry, who, it must
be confessed, was sometimes disposed to be the "Old Harry.""_She_ hoped you would be a good boy," added the monitor within."I will--that is, when I can afford it.""Be good now, or you never will."But the little angel--the act would forever
banish him from her presence.He would never dare to look at her
again, or even to write the letter he had promised."I will," exclaimed Harry, in an earnest whisper; and again the
tempter was cast out.Once more the fine air castles began to pile themselves up before
him, standing on the coveted treasure; but he resolutely pitched them
down, and banished them from his mind.I didn't miss it till this morning; and I have been to
every place where I was last night; so I think I must have lost it
here, when I put my horse up," replied another.The first speaker was one of the ostlers; and the moment Harry heard
the other voice he started as though a rattlesnake had rattled in his
path.As the speaker proceeded, he was satisfied
beyond the possibility of a doubt that the voice belonged to Squire
Walker."About a hundred and fifty dollars; and there were notes and other
papers of great value," replied Squire Walker."Well, I haven't seen or heard anything about it.""I remember taking it out of my great-coat pocket, and putting it into
a pocket inside of my vest, when I got out of the wagon.""I don't think you lost it here.Some of us would have found it, if
you had."He had determined to restore the
pocketbook; but he could not do so without exposing himself.Besides,
if there had been any temptation to keep the treasure before, it was
ten times as great now that he knew it belonged to his enemy.It would
be no sin to keep it from Squire Walker."It would be stealing," said the voice within."But if I give it to him, he will carry me back to Jacob Wire's.I'll
be--I'll be hanged if I do.""She hopes you will be a good boy."There was no resisting this appeal; and again the demon was put down,
and the triumph added another laurel to the moral crown of the little
hero."It will be a dear journey to me," continued Squire Walker."I was
looking all day yesterday after a boy that ran away from the
poorhouse, and came to the city for him.I brought that money down to put in the bank.Harry waited no longer; but while his heart beat like the machinery in
the great factory at Rockville, he tumbled out of his nest, and slid
down the bale of goods to the pavement.exclaimed Squire
Walker, springing forward to catch him.Harry dodged, and kept out of his reach.shouted the squire to the ostler."Wait a minute, Squire Walker," said Harry."I won't go back to Jacob
Wire's, anyhow.Just hear what I have got to say; and then, if you
want to take me, you may, if you can."It was evident, even to the squire, that Harry had something of
importance to say; and he involuntarily paused to hear it."I have found your pocketbook, squire, and--"

"Give it to me, and I won't touch you," cried the overseer, eagerly.It was clear that the loss of his pocketbook had produced a salutary
impression on the squire's mind.He loved money, and the punishment
was more than he could bear."I was walking along here, last night, when I struck my foot against
something.I picked it up, and found it was a pocketbook.Here it is;" and Harry handed him his lost treasure.exclaimed he, after he had assured himself that the
contents of the pocketbook had not been disturbed."That is more than
ever I expected of you, Master Harry West.""I mean to be honest," replied Harry, proudly.I told you, Harry, I wouldn't touch you; and I
won't," continued the squire.He had come to Boston with the intention of
catching Harry, cost what it might,--he meant to charge the expense to
the town; but the recovery of his money had warmed his heart, and
banished the malice he cherished toward the boy.Squire Walker volunteered some excellent advice for the guidance of
the little pilgrim, who, he facetiously observed, had now no one to
look after his manners and morals--manners first, and morals
afterwards.He must be very careful and prudent, and he wished him
well.Harry, however, took this wholesome counsel as from whom it
came, and was not very deeply impressed by it.John Lane came to the stable soon after, and congratulated our hero
upon the termination of the persecution from Redfield, and, when his
horses were hitched on, bade him good bye, with many hearty wishes for
his future success.CHAPTER XIII

IN WHICH HARRY BECOMES A STABLE BOY, AND HEARS BAD NEWS FROM ROCKVILLE


Harry was exceedingly rejoiced at the remarkable turn his affairs had
taken.It is true, he had lost the treasure upon which his fancy had
built so many fine castles; but he did not regret the loss, since it
had purchased his exemption from the Redfield persecution.He had
conquered his enemy--which was a great victory--by being honest and
upright; and he had conquered himself--which was a greater victory--by
listening to the voice within him.He resisted temptation, and the
victory made him strong.Our hero had won a triumph, but the battlefield was still spread out
before him.There were thousands of enemies lurking in his path, ready
to fall upon and despoil him of his priceless treasure--his integrity."She had hoped he would be a good boy."He had done his duty--he had
been true in the face of temptation.He wanted to write to Julia then,
and tell her of his triumph--that, when tempted, he had thought of
her, and won the victory.The world was before him; it had no place for idlers, and he must get
work.The contents of the basket were not yet exhausted, and he took
it to a retired corner to eat his breakfast.While he was thus
engaged, Joe Flint, the ostler, happened to see him."Why don't you go to the tavern and
have your breakfast like a gentleman?""I can't afford it," replied Harry.How much did the man that owned the pocketbook give
you?"I'm blamed if he ain't a mean one!"I was too glad to get clear of him to think
of anything else.""Next time he loses his pocketbook, I hope he won't find it."And with this charitable observation, Joe resumed his labors.Harry
finished his meal, washed it down with a draught of cold water at the
pump, and was ready for business again.Unfortunately, there was no
business ready for him.All day long he wandered about the streets in
search of employment; but people did not appreciate his value.No one
would hire him or have anything to do with him.The five patches on
his clothes, he soon discovered, rendered it useless for him to apply
at the stores.He was not in a condition to be tolerated about one of
these; and he turned his attention to the market, the stables, and the
teaming establishments, yet with no better success.It was in vain
that he tried again; and at night, weary and dispirited, he returned
to Major Phillips's stable.His commissariat was not yet exhausted; and he made a hearty supper
from the basket.It became an interesting question for him to
consider how he should pass the night.He could not afford to pay one
of his quarters for a night's lodging at the tavern opposite.There
was the stable, however, if he could get permission to sleep there."May I sleep in the hay loft, Joe?"he asked, as the ostler passed
him."Major Phillips don't allow any one to sleep in the hay loft; but
perhaps he will let you sleep there.said Harry, not a little
surprised to find his fame had gone before him."He heard about the pocketbook, and wanted to see you.He said it was
the meanest thing he ever heard of, that the man who lost it didn't
give you anything; and them's my sentiments exactly.Here comes the
major; I will speak to him about you.""Major Phillips, this boy wants to know if he may sleep in the hay
loft to-night.""No," replied the stable keeper, short as pie crust."This is the boy that found the pocketbook, and he hain't got no place
to sleep."Then I will find a place for him to sleep.So, my boy, you
are an honest fellow.""I try to be," replied Harry, modestly."If you had kept the pocketbook you might have lodged at the Tremont
House.""I had rather sleep in your stable, without it.""Squire Walker was mean not to give you a ten-dollar bill.What are
you going to do with yourself?""I want to get work; perhaps you have got something for me to do."Well, I don't know as I have."Major Phillips was a great fat man, rough, vulgar, and profane in his
conversation; but he had a kind of sympathizing nature.Though he
swore like a pirate sometimes, his heart was in the right place, so
far as humanity was concerned.He took Harry into the counting room of the stable, and questioned him
in regard to his past history and future prospects.The latter,
however, were just now rather clouded.He told the major his
experience in trying to get something to do, and was afraid he should
not find a place.The stable keeper was interested in him and in his story.He swore
roundly at the meanness of Jacob Wire and Squire Walker, and commended
him for running away."Well, my lad, I don't know as I can do much for you.I have three
ostlers now, which is quite enough, and all I can afford to pay; but I
suppose I can find enough for a boy to do about the house and the
stable."You can't earn much for me just now; but if you are a-mind to try it,
I will give you six dollars a month and your board.""Thank you, sir; I shall be very glad of the chance.""Very well; but if you work for me, you must get up early in the
morning, and be wide awake.""Now, we will see about a place for you to sleep."Over the counting room was an apartment in which two of the ostlers
slept.There was room for another bed, and one was immediately set up
for Harry's use.Once more, then, our hero was at home, if a mere abiding place
deserves that hallowed name.It was not an elegant, or even a
commodious, apartment in which Harry was to sleep.The walls were
dingy and black; the beds looked as though they had never been clean;
and there was a greasy smell which came from several harnesses that
were kept there.It was comfortable, if not poetical; and Harry soon
felt perfectly at home.His first duty was to cultivate the acquaintance of the ostlers.He
found them to be rough, good-natured men, not over-scrupulous about
their manners or their morals.If it does not occur to my young
readers, it will to their parents, that this was not a fit place for
a boy--that he was in constant contact with corruption.His companions
were good-hearted men; but this circumstance rendered them all the
more dangerous.There was no fireside of home, at which the evil
effects of communication with men of loose morals would be
counteracted.Harry had not been an hour in their society before he
caught himself using a big oath--which, when he had gone to bed, he
heartily repented, renewing his resolution with the promise to try
again.He was up bright and early the next morning, made a fire in the
counting room, and had let out half the horses in the stable to water,
before Major Phillips came out.His services were in demand, as Joe
Flint, for some reason, had not come to the stable that morning.The stable keeper declared that he had gone on a "spree," and told
Harry he might take his place.Harry did take his place; and the ostlers declared that, in everything
but cleaning the horses, he made good his place.The knowledge and
skill which he had obtained at the poorhouse was of great value to
him; and, at night, though he was very tired, he was satisfied that he
had done a good day's work.The ostlers took their meals at the house of Major Phillips, which
stood at one side of the stable yard.Phillips
very well; she was cross, and the men said she was a "regular Tartar."He afterwards found it a
difficult matter; for he had to bring wood and water, and do other
chores about the house, and he soon ascertained that she was
determined not to be pleased with anything he did.He tried to keep
his temper, however, and meekly submitted to all her scolding and
grumbling.Thus far, while Harry has been passing through the momentous period of
his life with which we commenced his story, we have minutely detailed
the incidents of his daily life, so that we have related the events of
only a few days.He has got a place, and
of course one day is very much like every other.The reader knows him
now--knows what kind of boy he is, and what his hopes and expectations
are.The reader knows, too, the great moral epoch in his history--the
event which roused his consciousness of error, and stimulated him to
become better; that he has a talisman in his mind, which can be no
better expressed than by those words he so often repeated, "She hoped
he would be a good boy."And her angel smile went with him to
encourage him in the midst of trial and temptation--to give him the
victory over the foes that assailed him.We shall henceforth give results, instead of a daily record, stopping
to detail only the great events of his career.We shall pass over three months, during which time he worked
diligently and faithfully for Major Phillips.Every day had its trials
and temptations; not a day passed in which there were none.The habit
of using profane language he found it very hard to eradicate; but he
persevered; and though he often sinned, he as often repented and tried
again, until he had fairly mastered the enemy.It was a great triumph,
especially when it is remembered that he was surrounded by those whose
every tenth word at least was an oath.He was tempted to lie, tempted to neglect his work, tempted to steal,
tempted in a score of other things.And often he yielded; but the
remembrance of the little angel, and the words of the good Book she
had given him, cheered and supported him as he struggled on.Harry's finances were in a tolerably prosperous condition.With his
earnings he had bought a suit of clothes, and went to church half a
day every Sunday.Besides his wages, he had saved about five dollars
from the "perquisites" which he received from customers for holding
their horses, running errands, and other little services a boy could
perform.He was very careful and prudent with his money; and whenever
he added anything to his little hoard, he thought of the man who had
become rich by saving up his fourpences.He still cherished his
purpose to become a rich man, and it is very likely he had some
brilliant anticipations of success.Not a cent did he spend foolishly,
though it was hard work to resist the inclination to buy the fine
things that tempted him from the shop windows.Those who knew him best regarded him as a very strange boy; but that
was only because he was a little out of his element.He would have
preferred to be among men who did not bluster and swear; but, in spite
of them, he had the courage and the fortitude to be true to himself.The little angel still maintained her ascendency in his moral nature.The ostlers laughed at him when he took out his little Bible, before
he went to bed, to drink of the waters of life.They railed at him,
called him "Little Pious," and tried to induce him to pitch cents, in
the back yard, on Sunday afternoon, instead of going to church.He
generally bore these taunts with patience, though sometimes his high
spirit would get the better of his desire to be what the little angel
wished him to be.John Lane put up at the stable once a week; and, every time he
returned to Rockville, he carried a written or a verbal account of the
prosperity of the little pauper boy.One Sunday, he wrote her a long
letter all about "being good"--how he was tempted, and how he
struggled for her sake and for the sake of the truth.In return, he often received messages and letters from her, breathing
the same pure spirit which she had manifested when she "fed him in the
wilderness."These communications strengthened his moral nature, and
enabled him to resist temptation.He felt just as though she was an
angel sent into the world to watch over him.Perhaps he had fallen
without them; at any rate, her influence was very powerful.About the middle of January, when the earth was covered with snow, and
the bleak, cold winds of winter blew over the city, John Lane informed
Harry, on his arrival, that Julia was very sick with the scarlet fever
and canker rash, and it was feared she would not recover.He wept when he thought of her
sweet face reddened with the flush of fever; and he fled to his
chamber, to vent his emotions in silence and solitude.CHAPTER XIV

IN WHICH HARRY DOES A GOOD DEED, AND DETERMINES TO "FACE THE MUSIC"


While Harry sat by the stove in the ostlers' room, grieving at the
intelligence he had received from Rockville, a little girl, so lame
that she walked with a crutch, hobbled into the apartment.she asked, in tones so sad that Harry could not
help knowing she was in distress."I don't know as I am acquainted with your father," replied Harry."He is one of the ostlers here.""Yes; he has not been home to dinner or supper to-day, and mother is
very sick.""I haven't seen him to-day."sighed the little girl, as she
hobbled away.Harry was struck by the sad appearance of the girl, and the desponding
words she uttered.Of late, Joe Flint's vile habit of intemperance had
grown upon him so rapidly that he did not work at the stable more than
one day in three.For two months, Major Phillips had been threatening
to discharge him; and nothing but kindly consideration for his family
had prevented him from doing so.asked Harry of one of the ostlers, who
came into the room soon after the departure of the little girl."No, and don't want to see him," replied Abner, testily; for, in Joe's
absence, his work had to be done by the other ostlers, who did not
feel very kindly towards him."His little girl has just been here after him.""Very likely he hasn't been home for a week," added Abner."I should
think his family would be very thankful if they never saw him again.He is a nuisance to himself and everybody else.""Just up in Avery Street--in a ten-footer there.""The little girl said her mother was very sick."She is always sick; and I don't much wonder.Joe Flint is
enough to make any one sick.He has been drunk about two-thirds of the
time for two months.""I don't see how his family get along."After Abner had warmed himself, he left the room.Harry was haunted by
the sad look and desponding tones of the poor lame girl.It was a
bitter cold evening; and what if Joe's family were suffering with the
cold and hunger!It was sad to think of such a thing; and Harry was
deeply moved."She hoped I would be a good boy.She is very sick now, and perhaps
she will die," said Harry to himself."What would she do, if she were
here now?"He knew very well what she would do, and he determined to do it
himself.His heart was so deeply moved by the picture of sorrow and
suffering with which his imagination had invested the home of the
intemperate ostler that it required no argument to induce him to go.However sweet and consoling
may be the sympathy of others to those in distress, it will not warm
the chilled limbs or feed the hungry mouths; and Harry thanked God
then that he had not spent his money foolishly upon gewgaws and
gimcracks, or in gratifying a selfish appetite.After assuring himself that no one was approaching, he jumped on his
bedstead, and reaching up into a hole in the board ceiling of the
room, he took out a large wooden pill box, which was nearly filled
with various silver coins, from a five-cent piece to a half dollar.Putting the box in his pocket, he went down to the stable, and
inquired more particularly in relation Joe's house.When he had received such directions as would enable him to find the
place, he told Abner he wanted to be absent a little while, and left
the stable.He had no difficulty in finding the home of the drunkard's
family.It was a little, old wooden house, in Avery Street, opposite
Haymarket Place, which has long since been pulled down to make room
for a more elegant dwelling.Harry knocked, and was admitted by the little lame girl whom he had
seen at the stable."I have come to see if I can do anything for you," said Harry, as he
moved forward into the room in which the family lived."I haven't; Abner says he hasn't been to the stable to-day.asked Harry, as he entered the dark room."We haven't got any oil, nor any candles."In the fireplace, a piece of pine board was blazing, which cast a
faint and fitful glare into the room; and Harry was thus enabled to
behold the scene which the miserable home of the drunkard presented.In one corner was a dilapidated bedstead, on which lay the sick woman.Drawn from under it was a trundle bed, upon which lay two small
children, who had evidently been put to bed at that early hour to keep
them warm, for the temperature of the apartment was scarcely more
comfortable than that of the open air.It was a cheerless home; and
the faint light of the blazing board only served to increase the
desolate appearance of the place."The boy that works at the stable," replied the lame girl."My name is Harry West, marm; and I come to see if you wanted
anything," added Harry."We want a great many things," sighed she."Can you tell me where my
husband is?""I can't; he hasn't been at the stable to-day."and I will do
everything I can for you."When her mother sobbed, the lame girl sat down on the bed and cried
bitterly.Harry's tender heart was melted; and he would have wept also
if he had not been conscious of the high mission he had to perform;
and he felt very grateful that he was able to dry up those tears and
carry gladness to those bleeding hearts."I don't know what you can do for us," said the poor woman, "though I
am sure I am very much obliged to you.""I can do a great deal, marm.Cheer up," replied Harry, tenderly.As he spoke, one of the children in the trundle bed sobbed in its
sleep; and the poor mother's heart seemed to be lacerated by the
sound."He had no supper but a crust of bread and a
cup of cold water.He cried himself to sleep with cold and hunger."And the room is very cold," added Harry, glancing around him.Our wood is all gone but two great logs."I worked for an hour trying to split some pieces off them," said
Katy, the lame girl."I will fix them, marm," replied Harry, who felt the strength of ten
stout men in his limbs at that moment.Katy brought him a peck basket, and Harry rushed out of the house as
though he had been shot.Great deeds were before him, and he was
inspired for the occasion.Placing it in a chair, he took from it a package of candles, one of
which he lighted and placed in a tin candlestick on the table."Now we have got a little light on the subject," said he, as he began
to display the contents of the basket."Here, Katy, is two pounds of
meat; here is half a pound of tea; you had better put a little in the
teapot, and let it be steeping for your mother.""You are an angel sent from
Heaven to help us in our distress.""No, marm; I ain't an angel," answered Harry, who seemed to feel that
Julia Bryant had an exclusive monopoly of that appellation, so far as
it could be reasonably applied to mortals."I only want to do my duty,
marm."Katy Flint was so bewildered that she could say nothing, though her
opinion undoubtedly coincided with that of her mother."Here is two loaves of bread and two dozen crackers; a pound of
butter; two pounds of sugar.I will go down to Thomas's in two shakes of
a jiffy."Flint protested that she did not want any milk--that she could
get along very well without it; but Harry said the children must have
it; and, without waiting for Katy to get the pitcher, he took it from
the closet, and ran out of the house.When he returned he found Katy trying
to make the teakettle boil, but with very poor success."Now, Katy, show me the logs, and I will soon have a fire."The lame girl conducted him to the cellar, where Harry found the
remnants of the old box which Katy had tried to split.Seizing the
axe, he struck a few vigorous blows, and the pine boards were reduced
to a proper shape for use.Taking an armful, he returned to the
chamber; and soon a good fire was blazing under the teakettle."There, marm, we will soon have things to rights," said Harry, as he
rose from the hearth, where he had stooped down to blow the fire."I am sure we should have perished if you had not come," added Mrs.Flint, who was not disposed to undervalue Harry's good deeds."I hope we shall be able to pay you back all the money you have spent;
but I don't know.Joseph has got so bad, I don't know what he is
coming to.He always uses me well, even when
he is in liquor.Nothing but drink could make him neglect us so.""It is a hard case, marm," added Harry."Very hard; he hasn't done much of anything for us this winter.I have
been out to work every day till a fortnight ago, when I got sick and
couldn't do anything.Katy has kept us alive since then; she is a good
girl, and takes the whole care of Tommy and Susan.""I don't mind that, if I only had things to do with," said Katy, who
was busy disposing of the provisions which Harry had bought.As soon as the kettle boiled, she made tea, and prepared a little
toast for her mother, who, however, was too sick to take much
nourishment."Now, Katy, you must eat yourself," interposed Harry, when all was
ready."I can't eat," replied the poor girl, bursting into tears.Just then the children in the trundle bed, disturbed by the unusual
bustle in the room, waked, and gazed with wonder at Harry, who had
seated himself on the bed.exclaimed Katy; "she has waked up.They were taken up; and Harry's eyes were gladdened by such a sight as
he had never beheld before.The hungry ate; and every mouthful they
took swelled the heart of the little almoner of God's bounty.If the
thought of Julia Bryant, languishing on a bed of sickness, had not
marred his satisfaction, he had been perfectly happy.But he was
doing a deed that would rejoice her heart; he was doing just what she
had done for him; he was doing just what she would have done, if she
had been there."She hoped he would be a good boy."His conscience told him he had
been a good boy--that he had been true to himself, and true to the
noble example she had set before him.While the family were still at supper, Harry, lighting another candle,
went down cellar to pay his respects to those big logs.He was a stout
boy, and accustomed to the use of the axe.By slow degrees he chipped
off the logs, until they were used up, and a great pile of serviceable
wood was before him.Not content with this, he carried up several
large armfuls of it, which he deposited by the fireplace in the room."Now, marm, I don't know as I can do anything more for you to-night,"
said he, moving towards the door."The Lord knows you have done enough," replied the poor woman."I hope
we shall be able to pay you for what you have done.""I don't want anything, marm.""If we can't pay you, the Lord will reward you."I hope you will get better, marm."I feel better to-night than I have felt before for a
week."asked Abner, when he entered the
ostler's room.The old man wanted you; and when he couldn't find you,
he was mad as thunder."said Harry, somewhat annoyed to find that, while he had
been doing his duty in one direction, he had neglected his duty in
another.Whatever he should catch, he determined to "face the music," and left
the room to find his employer.CHAPTER XV

IN WHICH HARRY MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A VERY IMPORTANT PERSONAGE


Major Phillips was in the counting room, where Harry, dreading his
anger, presented himself before him.He usually acted first, and thought the matter over afterwards; so
that he frequently had occasion to undo what had been done in haste
and passion.His heart was kind, but his temper generally had the
first word."So you have come, Harry," exclaimed he, as our hero opened the door."I have been out a little while," replied Harry, whose modesty
rebelled at the idea of proclaiming the good deed he had done.roared the major, with an oath that froze the
boy's blood.You know I don't allow man
or boy to leave the stable without letting me know it.""I was wrong, sir; but I--"

"You little snivelling monkey, how dared you leave the stable?"continued the stable keeper, heedless of the boy's submission."I'll
teach you better than that."said Harry, suddenly changing his tone, as his blood began
to boil."You can begin as quick as you like."I have a great mind to give you a cowhiding,"
thundered the enraged stable keeper."I should like to see you do it," replied Harry, fixing his eyes on
the poker that lay on the floor near the stove."Should you, you impertinent puppy?"The major sprang forward, as if to grasp the boy by the collar; but
Harry, with his eyes still fixed on the poker, retreated a pace or
two, ready to act promptly when the decisive moment should come.Forgetting for the time that he had run away from one duty to attend
to another, he felt indignant that he should be thus rudely treated
for being absent a short time on an errand of love and charity.He
gave himself too much credit for the good deed, and felt that he was a
martyr to his philanthropic spirit.He was willing to bear all and
brave all in a good cause; and it seemed to him, just then, as though
he was being punished for assisting Joe Flint's family, instead of for
leaving his place without permission.A great many persons who mean
well are apt to think themselves martyrs for any good cause in which
they may be engaged, when, in reality, their own want of tact, or the
offensive manner in which they present their truth, is the stake at
which they are burned.The major was so angry that he could do nothing; and while they were
thus confronting each other, Joe Flint staggered into the counting
room.Intoxicated as he was, he readily discovered the position of
affairs between the belligerents."Look here--hic--Major Phillips," said he, reeling up to his employer,
"I love you--hic--Major Phillips, like a--hic--like a brother, Major
Phillips; but if you touch that boy, Major Phillips, I'll--hic--you
touch me, Major Phillips."Go home, Joe," replied the stable keeper, his attention diverted from
Harry to the new combatant."I know I'm drunk, Major Phillips.I'm as drunk as a beast; but I
ain't--hic--dead drunk.I'm a brute; I'm a hog; I'm a--dzwhat you call it?Joe tried to straighten himself up, and look at his employer; but he
could not, and suddenly bursting into tears, he threw himself heavily
into a chair, weeping bitterly in his inebriate paroxysm.He sobbed,
and groaned, and talked incoherently.He acted strangely, and Major
Phillips's attention was excited.he asked; and his anger towards Harry
seemed to have subsided."I tell you I am a villain, Major Phillips," blubbered Joe."Haven't I been on a drunk, and left my family to starve and freeze?"groaned Joe, interlarding his speech with violent ebullitions of
weeping."Wouldn't my poor wife, and my poor children--O my God," and
the poor drunkard covered his face with his hands, and sobbed like an
infant.asked Major Phillips, who
had never seen him in this frame before."Wouldn't they all have died if Harry hadn't gone and fed 'em, and
split up wood to warm 'em?"As he spoke, Joe sprang up, and rushed towards Harry, and in his
drunken frenzy attempted to embrace him.said the stable keeper, turning to our
hero, who, while Joe was telling his story, had been thinking of
something else."What a fool I was to get mad!""What would she say if she
had seen me just now?"My folks would have died if it hadn't been for him," hiccoughed Joe."Explain it, Harry," added the major."The lame girl, Katy, came down here after her father early in the
evening.She seemed to be in trouble and I thought I would go up and
see what the matter was.I found them in rather a bad condition,
without any wood or anything to eat.I did what I could for them, and
came away," replied Harry.and the major grasped his hand like a
vise."You are a good fellow," he added, with an oath.Phillips, for saying what I did; I was mad," pleaded
Harry."So was I, my boy; but we won't mind that.You are a good fellow, and
I like your spunk.So you have really been taking care of Joe's family
while he was off on a drunk?""Look here, Harry, and you, Major Phillips.When I get this rum out of
me I'll never take another drop again," said Joe, throwing himself
into a chair.You have said that twenty times before," added Major
Phillips.exclaimed Joe, doubling his fist, and bringing it down
with the intention of hitting the table by his side to emphasize his
resolution; but, unfortunately, he missed the table--a circumstance
which seemed to fore-shadow the fate of his resolve.Joe proceeded to declare in his broken speech what a shock he had
received when he went home, half an hour before--the first time for
several days--and heard the reproaches of his suffering wife; how
grateful he was to Harry, and what a villain he considered himself.Either the sufferings of his family, or the rum he had drunk, melted
his heart, and he was as eloquent as his half-paralyzed tongue would
permit.He was a pitiable object; and having assured himself that
Joe's family were comfortable for the night, Major Phillips put him to
bed in his own house.Harry was not satisfied with himself; he had permitted his temper to
get the better of him.He thought of Julia on her bed of suffering,
wept for her, and repented for himself.That night he heard the clock
on the Boylston market strike twelve before he closed his eyes to
sleep.The next day, while he was at work in the stable, a boy of about
fifteen called to see him, and desired to speak with him alone.Harry,
much wondering who his visitor was, and what he wanted, conducted him
to the ostlers' chamber."That is my name, for the want of a better," replied Harry."Then there is a little matter to be settled between you and me.You
helped my folks out last night, and I want to pay you for it.""I am," replied Edward, who did not seem to feel much honored by the
relationship."Your folks were in a bad condition last night.""But I didn't know Joe had a son as old as you are.""I am the oldest; but I don't live at home, and have not for three
years.How much did you pay out for them last night?"Edward Flint manifested some uneasiness at the announcement.He had
evidently come with a purpose, but had found things different from
what he had expected."I didn't think it was so much.""The fact is, I have only three dollars just now; and I promised to go
out to ride with a fellow next Sunday.So, you see, if I pay you, I
shall not have enough left to foot the bills."Harry looked at his visitor with astonishment; he did not know what to
make of him.Would a son of Joseph Flint go out to
ride--on Sunday, too--while his mother and his brothers and sisters
were on the very brink of starvation?Our hero had some strange,
old-fashioned notions of his own.For instance, he considered it a
son's duty to take care of his mother, even if he were obliged to
forego the Sunday ride; that he ought to do all he could for his
brothers and sisters, even if he had to go without stewed oysters,
stay away from the theatre, and perhaps wear a little coarser cloth on
his back.If Harry was unreasonable in his views, my young reader will
remember that he was brought up in the country, where young America is
not quite so "fast" as in the city."I didn't ask you to pay me," continued Harry."I know that; but, you see, I suppose I ought to pay you.The old man
don't take much care of the family."Harry wanted to say that the young man did not appear to do much
better; but he was disposed to be as civil as the circumstances would
permit."Oh, yes, I shall pay you; but if you can wait till the first of next
month, I should like it."I am a clerk in a store
downtown," replied Edward, with offended dignity."Pretty fair; I get five dollars a week."I should think you did get paid pretty
well!"exclaimed Harry, astonished at the vastness of the sum for a
week's work."Fair salary," added Edward, complacently."I work in the stable and about the house.""Six dollars a month and perquisites.""It is as well as I can do.""No, it isn't; why don't you go into a store?"We pay from two to four dollars a week."asked Harry, now much interested in his
companion."Make the fires, sweep out in the morning, go on errands, and such
work.Boys must begin at the foot of the ladder.I began at the foot
of the ladder," answered Mr.Flint, with an immense self-sufficiency,
which Harry, however, failed to notice."I should like to get into a store.""You will have a good chance to rise.""I am willing to do anything, so that I can have a chance to get
ahead."As it was, he was left to
infer that Mr.Flint was a partner in the concern, unless the five
dollars per week was an argument to the contrary; but he didn't like
to ask strange questions, and desired to know whom "he worked for."Edward Flint did not "work for" anybody.He was a clerk in the
extensive dry goods establishment of the Messrs.Wake & Wade, which,
he declared, was the largest concern in Boston; and one might further
have concluded that Mr.Flint was the most important personage in the
said concern.Flint was obliged to descend from his lofty dignity, and compound
the dollar and twenty cents with the stable boy by promising to get
him the vacant place in the establishment of Wake & Wade, if his
influence was sufficient to procure it.Harry was satisfied, and
begged him not to distress himself about the debt.The visitor took
his leave, promising to see him again the next day.About noon Joe Flint appeared at the stable again, perfectly sober.Major Phillips had lent him ten dollars, in anticipation of his
month's wages, and he had been home to attend to the comfort of his
suffering family.After dinner he had a long talk with Harry, in
which, after paying him the money disbursed on the previous evening,
he repeated his solemn resolution to drink no more.He was very
grateful to Harry, and hoped he should be able to do as much for him."Don't drink any more, Joe, and it will be the best day's work I ever
did," added Harry.CHAPTER XVI

IN WHICH HARRY GOES INTO THE DRYGOODS BUSINESS


Mr.Edward Flint's reputation as a gentleman of honor and a man of his
word suffered somewhat in Harry's estimation; for he waited all day,
and all evening, without hearing a word from the firm of Wake & Wade.He had actually begun to doubt whether the accomplished young man had
as much influence with the firm as he had led him to suppose.But his
ambition would not permit him longer to be satisfied with the humble
sphere of a stable boy; and he determined, if he did not hear from
Edward, to apply for the situation himself.The next day, having procured two hours' leave of absence from the
stable, he called at the home of Joe Flint to obtain further
particulars concerning Edward and his situation.He found the family
in much better circumstances than at his previous visit.Flint
was sitting up, and was rapidly convalescing; Katy was busy and
cheerful; and it seemed a different place from that to which he had
been the messenger of hope and comfort two nights before.They were very glad to see him, and poured forth their gratitude to
him so eloquently that he was obliged to change the topic.Flint
was sure that her husband was an altered man.She had never before
known him to be so earnest and solemn in his resolutions to amend and
lead a new life.But when Harry alluded to Edward, both Katy and her mother suddenly
grew red.They acknowledged that they had sent for him in their
extremity, but that he did not come till the next morning, when the
bounty of the stable boy had relieved them from the bitterness of
want.The mother dropped a tear as she spoke of the wayward son; and
Harry had not the heart to press the inquiries he had come to make.After speaking as well as he dared to speak of Edward, he took his
leave, and hastened to the establishment of Wake & Wade, to apply for
the vacant place.He had put on his best clothes, and his appearance
this time was very creditable.Entering the store, he inquired for Edward Flint; and that gentleman
was summoned to receive him."I
declare I forgot all about you.""I thought likely," replied Harry, willing to be very charitable to
the delinquent."The fact is, we have been so busy in the store I haven't had time to
call on you, as I promised."Do you think there is any chance for me?""Wait here a moment till I speak with one of the partners."The clerk left him, and was absent but a moment, when Harry was
summoned to the private room of Mr.The gentleman questioned him
for a few moments, and seemed to be pleased with his address and his
frankness.The result of the interview was that our hero was engaged
at a salary of three dollars a week, though it was objected to him
that he had no parents residing in the city."I thought I could fix it," said Edward, complacently, as they left
the counting room."I am much obliged to you, Edward," replied Harry, willing to humor
his new friend."Now I want to get a place to board."Suppose we should both board
with your mother.""What, in a ten-footer!"exclaimed Edward, starting back with
astonishment and indignation at the proposal.If it is good enough for your mother, isn't it good enough
for you?""We can fix up a room to suit ourselves, you know.And it will be much
cheaper for both of us.""That, indeed; but the idea of boarding with the old man is not to be
thought of.""I should think you would like to be with your mother and your
brothers and sisters."The clerk promised to think about it, but did not consider it very
probable that he should agree to the proposition.Harry returned to the stable, and immediately notified Major Phillips
of his intention to leave his service.As may be supposed, the stable
keeper was sorry to lose him; but he did not wish to stand in the way
of his advancement.He paid him his wages, adding a gift of five
dollars, and kindly permitted him to leave at once, as he desired to
procure a place to board, and to acquaint himself with the localities
of the city, so that he could discharge his duty the more acceptably
to his new employers.The ostlers, too, were sorry to part with him--particularly Joe Flint,
whose admiration of our hero was unbounded.In their rough and honest
hearts they wished him well.They had often made fun of his good
principles; often laughed at him for refusing to pitch cents in the
back yard on Sunday, and for going to church instead; often ridiculed
him under the name of "Little Pious"; still they had a great respect
for him.They who are "persecuted for righteousness' sake"--who are
made fun of because they strive to do right--are always sure of
victory in the end.They may be often tried, but sooner or later they
shall triumph.After dinner, he paid another visit to Mrs.He
opened his proposition to board in her family, to which she raised
several objections, chief of which was that she had no room.The plan
was more favorably received by Katy; and she suggested that they could
hire the little apartment upstairs, which was used as a kind of lumber
room by the family in the other part of the house.Her mother finally consented to the arrangement, and it became
necessary to decide upon the terms, for Harry was a prudent manager,
and left nothing to be settled afterwards.He then introduced the
project he had mentioned to Edward; and Mrs.Flint thought she could
board them both for three dollars a week, if they could put up with
humble fare.Harry declared that he was not "difficult," though he
could not speak for Edward.Our hero was delighted with the success of his scheme, and only wished
that Edward had consented to the arrangement; but the next time he saw
him, somewhat to his surprise, the clerk withdrew his objections, and
entered heartily into the scheme."You see, Harry, I shall make a dollar a week--fifty-two dollars a
year--by the arrangement," said Edward, after he had consented.He evidently considered that some apology was due from him for
condescending from the social dignity of his position in the Green
Street boarding house to the humble place beneath his mother's roof."Certainly you will; and that is a great deal of money," replied
Harry."It will pay my theatre tickets, and for a ride once a month besides."asked Harry, astonished at his companion's theory of
economy.I mean to have a good time while I
can.""You could give your mother and Katy a great many nice things with
that money."It is all I can do to take
care of myself.""If I had a mother, and brothers and sisters, I should be glad to
spend all I got in making them happy," sighed Harry.On the following Monday morning, Harry went to his new place.Even the
language of the clerks and salesmen was strange to him; and he was
painfully conscious of the deficiencies of his education and of his
knowledge of business.He was prompt, active and zealous; yet his
awkwardness could not be concealed.The transition from the stable to
the store was as great as from a hovel to a palace.Wade swore at him; and all
the clerks made him the butt of their mirth or their ill nature, just
as they happened to feel.What seemed to him worse than all, Edward Flint joined the popular
side, and laughed and swore with the rest.Poor Harry was almost
discouraged before dinner time, and began very seriously to consider
whether he had not entirely mistaken his calling.Dinner, however,
seemed to inspire him with new courage and new energy; and he hastened
back to the store, resolved to try again.The shop was crowded with customers; and partners and clerks hallooed
"Harry" till he was so confused that he hardly knew whether he stood
on his head or his heels.It was, Come here, Go there, Bring this,
Bring that; but in spite of laugh and curse, of push and kick, he
persevered, suiting nobody, least of all himself.It was a long day, a very long day; but it came to an end at last.Our
hero had hardly strength enough left to put up the shutters.His legs
ached, his head ached, and, worst of all, his heart ached at the
manifest failure of his best intentions.He thought of going to the
partners, and asking them whether they thought he was fit for the
place; but he finally decided to try again for another day, and
dragged himself home to rest his weary limbs.He and Edward had taken possession of their room at Joe Flint's house
that morning; and on their arrival they found that Katy had put
everything in excellent order for their reception.Harry was too much
fatigued and disheartened to have a very lively appreciation of the
comforts of his new home; but Edward, notwithstanding the descent he
had made, was in high spirits.He even declared that the room they
were to occupy was better than his late apartments in Green Street."Do you think I shall get along with my work, Edward?"asked Harry,
gloomily, after they had gone to bed."Everybody in the store has kicked and cuffed me, swore at and abused
me, till I feel like a jelly.""Oh, never mind that; they always do so with a green one.They served
me just so when I first went into business.""It seemed to me just as though I never could suit them.""I can't help it, I know I did not suit them.""What made them laugh at me and swear at me, then?""That is the fashion; you must talk right up to them.If they swear at
you, swear at them back again--that is, the clerks and salesmen.If
they give you any 'lip,' let 'em have as good as they send."When you go among
the Romans, do as the Romans do."Harry did not like this advice; for he who, among the Romans, would do
as the Romans do, among hogs would do as the hogs do."If I only suit them, I don't care.""You do; I heard Wake tell Wade that you were a first-rate boy."And Harry's heart swelled with joy to think that, in spite
of his trials, he had actually triumphed in the midst of them.So he dropped the subject, with the resolution to redouble his
exertions to please his employers the next day, and turned his
thoughts to Julia Bryant, to wonder if she were still living, or had
become an angel indeed.CHAPTER XVII

IN WHICH HARRY REVISITS ROCKVILLE, AND MEETS WITH A SERIOUS LOSS


The next evening Harry was conscious of having gained a little in the
ability to discharge his novel duties.Either the partners and the
clerks had become tired of swearing and laughing at him, or he had
made a decided improvement, for less fault was found with him, and
his position was much more satisfactory.With a light heart he put up
the shutters; for though he was very much fatigued, the prestige of
future success was so cheering that he scarcely heeded his weary,
aching limbs.Every day was an improvement on the preceding day, and before the week
was out Harry found himself quite at home in his new occupation.He
was never a moment behind the time at which he was required to be at
the store in the morning.This promptness was specially noted by the
partners; for when they came to their business in the morning they
found the store well warmed, the floor nicely swept, and everything
put in order.When he was sent out with bundles he did not stop to look at the
pictures in the shop windows, to play marbles or tell long stories to
other boys in the streets.If his employers had even been very
unreasonable, they could not have helped being pleased with the new
boy, and Wake confidentially assured Wade that they had got a
treasure.He intended to make a man
of himself, and he could only accomplish his purpose by constant
exertion, by constant study and constant "trying again."He was
obliged to keep a close watch over himself, for often he was tempted
to be idle and negligent, to be careless and indifferent.After supper, on Thursday evening of his second week at Wake & Wade's,
he hastened to Major Phillips' stable to see John Lane, and obtain the
news from Rockville.His heart beat violently when he saw John's great
wagon, for he dreaded some fearful announcement from his sick friend.He had not before been so deeply conscious of his indebtedness to the
little angel as now, when she lay upon the bed of pain, perhaps of
death.She had kindled in his soul a love for the good and the
beautiful.She had inspired him with a knowledge of the difference
between the right and the wrong.In a word, she was the guiding star
of his existence.Her approbation was the bright guerdon of fidelity
to truth and principle.asked Harry, without giving John time to inquire why
he had left the stable."They think she is a little grain better."continued Harry, a great load of anxiety
removed from his soul."She is; but it is very doubtful how it will turn.I went in to see
her yesterday, and she spoke of you.""She said she should like to see you.""I should like to see her very much.""Her father told me, if you was a mind to go up to Rockville, he would
pay your expenses."I will go, if I can get away."Julia is an only child, and he
would do anything in the world to please her.""I will go and see the gentlemen I work for, and if they will let me,
I will go with you to-morrow morning.""Better take the stage; you will get there so much quicker."Harry returned home to ascertain of Edward where Mr.Wake lived, and
hastened to see him.That gentleman, however, coldly assured him if he
went to Rockville he must lose his place--they could not get along
without a boy.In vain Harry urged that he should be gone but two
days; the senior was inflexible.said he to himself, when he got into the street
again.Wake says she is no relation of mine, and he don't see why
I should go.She may die, and I shall never see her again.It did not require a great deal of deliberation to convince himself
that it was his duty to visit the sick girl.She had been a true
friend to him, and he could afford to sacrifice his place to procure
her even a slight gratification.Affection and duty called him one
way, self-interest the other.If he did not go, he should regret it as
long as he lived.Wake would take him again on his
return; if not, he could at least go to work in the stable again."Edward, I am going to Rockville to-morrow," he remarked to his
"chum," on his return to Mrs."The old man agreed to it, then?He never will
let a fellow off even for a day.""He did not; but I must go."He will discharge you, for he is a hard nut.""I must go," repeated Harry, taking a candle, and going up to their
chamber."You have got more spunk than I gave you credit for; but you are sure
of losing your place," replied Edward, following him upstairs.Harry opened a drawer in the old broken bureau in the room, and from
beneath his clothes took out the great pill box which served him for a
savings bank."You have got lots of money," remarked Edward, as he glanced at the
contents of the box."Not much; only twelve dollars," replied Harry, taking out three of
them to pay his expenses to Rockville."You won't leave that box there, will you, while you are gone?"I can hide it, though, before I go."Harry took his money and went to a bookstore in Washington Street,
where he purchased an appropriate present for Julia, for which he gave
half a dollar.On his return, he wrote her name in it, with his own as
the giver.Then the safety of his money came up for consideration; and
this matter was settled by raising a loose board in the floor and
depositing the pill box in a secure place.He had scarcely done so
before Edward joined him.He was not altogether
satisfied with the step he was about to take.It was not doing right
by his employers; but he compromised the matter in part by engaging
Edward, "for a consideration," to make the fires and sweep out the
next morning.At noon, on the following day, he reached Rockville, and hastened to
the house of Mr.he asked, breathless with interest, of the girl who
answered his knock.Harry was conducted into the house, and Mr.Bryant was informed of his
presence."I am glad you have come, Harry.Julia is much better to-day," said
her father, taking him by the hand."She has frequently spoken of you
during her illness, and feels a very strong interest in your welfare."I don't know what would have become of me if
she had not been a friend to me.""That is the secret of her interest in you.We love those best whom we
serve most.She is asleep now; but you shall see her as soon as she
wakes.In the meantime you had better have your dinner."Bryant looked very pale, and his eyes were reddened with weeping.Harry saw how much he had suffered during the last fortnight; but it
seemed natural to him that he should suffer terribly at the thought of
losing one so beautiful and precious as the little angel.Bryant could not leave the
couch of the little sufferer.The fond father could speak of nothing
but Julia, and more than once the tears flooded his eyes, as he told
Harry how meek and patient she had been through the fever, how loving
she was, and how resigned even to leave her parents, and go to the
heavenly Parent, to dwell with Him forever.Harry wept, too; and after dinner he almost feared to enter the
chamber, and behold the wreck which disease had made of this bright
and beautiful form.Removing the wrapper from the book he had
brought--a volume of sweet poems, entitled "Angel Songs"--he followed
Mr.Bryant into the sick girl's chamber."Ah, Harry, I am delighted to see you!"exclaimed she, in a whisper,
for her diseased throat rendered articulation difficult and painful."I am sorry to see you so sick, Julia," replied Harry, taking the
wasted hand she extended to him.I feel as though I should get well now.""You don't know how much I have thought of you while I lay here; how I
wished you were my brother, and could come in every day and see me,"
she continued, with a faint smile."Now tell me how you get along in Boston.""Very well; but your father says I must not talk much with you now.I
have brought you a little book," and he placed it in her hand.Now, Harry, you
must read me one of the angel songs.""I will; but I can't read very well," said he, as he opened the
volume.The piece he selected was a very
pretty and a very touching little song; and Harry's feelings were so
deeply moved by the pathetic sentiments of the poem and their
adaptation to the circumstances of the case, that he was quite
eloquent.Bryant interfered to prevent further
conversation; and Julia, though she had a great deal to say to her
young friend, cheerfully yielded to her mother's wishes, and Harry
reluctantly left the room.Towards night he was permitted to see her again, when he read several
of the angel songs to her, and gave her a brief account of the events
of his residence in Boston.She was pleased with his earnestness, and
smiled approvingly upon him for the moral triumphs he had achieved.The reward of all his struggles with trial and temptation was lavishly
bestowed in her commendation, and if fidelity had not been its own
reward, he could have accepted her approval as abundant compensation
for all he had endured.There was no silly sentiment in Harry's
composition; he had read no novels, seen no plays, knew nothing of
romance even "in real life."The homage he yielded to the fair and
loving girl was an unaffected reverence for simple purity and
goodness; that which the True Heart and the True Life never fail to
call forth whenever they exert their power.On the following morning, Julia's condition was very much improved,
and the physician spoke confidently of a favorable issue.Harry was
permitted to spend an hour by her bedside, inhaling the pure spirit
that pervaded the soul of the sick one.She was so much better that
her father proposed to visit the city, to attend to some urgent
business, which had been long deferred by her illness; and an
opportunity was thus afforded for Harry to return.Bryant drove furiously in his haste, changing horses twice on the
journey, so that they reached the city at one o'clock.On their
arrival, Harry's attention naturally turned to the reception he
expected to receive from his employers.He had not spoken of his
relations with them at Rockville, preferring not to pain them, on the
one hand, and not to take too much credit to himself for his devotion
to Julia, on the other.After the horse was disposed of at Major
Phillips's stable, Mr.Bryant walked down town with Harry; and when
they reached the store of Wake & Wade, he entered with him.asked the senior partner, rather
coldly, when he saw the delinquent.Harry was confused at this reception, though it was not unexpected."I didn't know but that you might be willing to take me again."Did you say that you did not want my
young friend, here?"Bryant, taking the offered hand of
Mr."I did say so," said the senior."I was not aware that he was your
friend, though," and he proceeded to inform Mr.Bryant that Harry had
left them against their wish."A few words with you, if you please."Wake conducted him to the private office, where they remained for
half an hour."It is all right, Harry," continued Mr.ejaculated our hero, rejoiced to find his place was
still secure."I would not have gone if I could possibly have helped
it.""You did right, my boy, and I honor you for your courage and
constancy."Bryant bade him an affectionate adieu, promising to write to him
often until Julia recovered, and then departed.With a grateful heart Harry immediately resumed his duties, and the
partners were probably as glad to retain him as he was to remain.At night, when he went to his chamber, he raised the loose board to
get the pill box, containing his savings, in order to return the money
he had not expended.To his consternation, he discovered that it was
gone!CHAPTER XVIII

IN WHICH HARRY MEETS WITH AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND GETS A HARD KNOCK ON
THE HEAD


It was in vain that Harry searched beneath the broken floor for his
lost treasure; it could not be found.He raised the boards up, and
satisfied himself that it had not slipped away into any crevice, or
fallen through into the room below; and the conclusion was inevitable
that the box had been stolen.The mystery confused Harry, for he was certain
that no one had seen him deposit the box beneath the floor.No one
except Edward even knew that he had any money.Flint nor Katy would have stolen it; and he was not
willing to believe that his room-mate would be guilty of such a mean
and contemptible act.He tried to assure himself that it had not been stolen--that it was
still somewhere beneath the floor; and he pulled up another board, to
resume the search.He had scarcely done so before Edward joined him.he asked, apparently very much astonished
at his chum's occupation."Are you going to pull the house down?"replied Harry, suspending
operations to watch Edward's expression when he told him of his loss."Put it here, under this loose board."Edward manifested a great deal of enthusiasm in the search.He was
sure it must be where Harry had put it, or that it had rolled back out
of sight; and he began tearing up the floor with a zeal that
threatened the destruction of the building.But the box could not be
found, and they were obliged to abandon the search."That is a fact; I can't spare that money, anyhow.I have been a good
while earning it, and it is too thundering bad to lose it.""I don't understand it," continued Edward."Nor I either," replied Harry, looking his companion sharp in the eye."No one knew I had it but you.""Do you mean to say I stole it?"exclaimed Edward, doubling his fist,
while his cheek reddened with anger.I didn't mean to lay it to you."And Edward was very glad to have the matter compromised."I did not; perhaps I spoke hastily.You know how hard I worked for
this money; and it seems hard to lose it.But no matter; I will try
again."Flint and Katy were much grieved when Harry told of his loss.They looked as though they suspected Edward, but said nothing, for it
was very hard to accuse a son or a brother of such a crime.Flint advised Harry to put his money in the savings bank in
future, promising to take care of his spare funds till they amounted
to five dollars, which was then the smallest sum that would be
received.It was a long time before our hero became reconciled to his
loss.He had made up his mind to be a rich man; and he had carefully
hoarded every cent he could spare, thus closely imitating the man who
got rich by saving his fourpences.A few days after the loss he was reading in one of Katy's Sunday
school books about a miser.The wretch was held up as a warning to
young folks by showing them how he starved his body and soul for the
sake of gold.exclaimed Harry, as he laid the book
upon the window."I have been hoarding up my money just like this old man in the book."You couldn't be mean and stingy if you
tried.""A miser wouldn't do what you did for us, Harry," added Mrs."I have been thinking too much of money.After all, perhaps it was
just as well that I lost that money.""I am sorry you lost it; for I don't think there is any danger of your
becoming a miser," said Katy."Perhaps not; at any rate, it has set me to thinking."Harry finished the book; and it was, fortunately, just such a work as
he required to give him right and proper views in regard to the value
of wealth.His dream of being a rich man was essentially modified by
these views; and he renewedly resolved that it was better to be a good
man than a rich man, if he could not be both.It seemed to him a
little remarkable that the minister should preach upon this very topic
on the following Sunday, taking for his text the words, "Seek ye first
the kingdom of heaven and all these things shall be added unto you."He was deeply impressed by the sermon, probably because it was on a
subject to which he had given some attention.A few days after his return from Rockville, Harry received a very
cheerful letter from Mr.Bryant, to which Julia had added a few lines
in a postscript.The little angel was rapidly recovering, and our hero
was rejoiced beyond expression.The favorable termination of her
illness was a joy which far outbalanced the loss of his money, and he
was as cheerful and contented as ever.As he expressed it, in rather
homely terms, he had got "the streak of fat and the streak of lean."Julia was alive; was to smile upon him again; was still to inspire him
with that love of goodness which had given her such an influence over
him.Week after week passed by, and Harry heard nothing of his lost
treasure; but Julia had fully recovered, and for the treasure lost an
incomparably greater treasure had been gained.Edward and himself
continued to occupy the same room, though ever since the loss of the
money box Harry's chum had treated him coldly.There had never been
much sympathy between them; for while Edward was at the theatre, or
perhaps at worse places, Harry was at home, reading some good book,
writing a letter to Rockville, or employed in some other worthy
occupation.While Harry was at church or at the Sunday school, Edward,
in company with some dissolute companion, was riding about the
adjacent country.Flint often remonstrated with her son upon the life he led, and
the dissipated habits he was contracting; and several times Harry
ventured to introduce the subject.Edward, however, would not hear a
word from either.It is true that we either grow better or worse, as
we advance in life; and Edward Flint's path was down a headlong steep.His mother wept and begged him to be a better boy.Harry often wondered how he could afford to ride out and visit the
theatre and other places of amusement so frequently.His salary was
only five dollars a week now; it was only four when he had said it was
five.He seemed to have money at all times, and to spend it very
freely.He could not help believing that the contents of his pill box
had paid for some of the "stews" and "Tom and Jerrys" which his
reckless chum consumed.But the nine dollars he had lost would have
been but a drop in the bucket compared with his extravagant outlays.One day, about six months after Harry's return from Rockville, as he
was engaged behind the counter, a young man entered the store and
accosted him.It was a familiar voice; and, to Harry's surprise, but not much to his
satisfaction, he recognized his old companion, Ben Smart, who, he had
learned from Mr.Bryant, had been sent to the house of correction for
burning Squire Walker's barn."Yes, I have been here six months.""You have got a sign out for a boy, I see."There were more errands to run than one boy
could attend to; besides, Harry had proved himself so faithful and so
intelligent, that Mr.Wake wished to retain him in the store, to fit
him for a salesman."You can speak a good word for me, Harry; for I should like to work
here," continued Ben."I thought you were in--in the--"

Harry did not like to use the offensive expression, and Ben's face
darkened when he discovered what the other was going to say."Not a word about that," said he."If you ever mention that little
matter, I'll take your life.""My father got me out, and then I ran away.Not a word more, for I had
as lief be hung for an old sheep as a lamb."Wake; you can apply to him," continued Harry.The senior
talked with him a few moments, and then retired to his private office,
calling Harry as he entered."If you say anything, I will be the death of you," whispered Ben, as
Harry passed him on his way to the office.Our hero was not particularly pleased with these threats; he certainly
was not frightened by them.Wake, as he presented himself
before the senior."Who is he, and what is he?"Bryant told you the story about my leaving Redfield,"
said Harry."That is the boy that run away with me.""And the one that set the barn afire?"And Harry returned to his work at the counter.Before Harry had time to make any reply, Mr."We don't want you, young man," said he.With a glance of hatred at Harry, the applicant left the store.Since
leaving Redfield, our hero's views of duty had undergone a change; and
he now realized that to screen a wicked person was to plot with him
against the good order of society.He knew Ben's character; he had no
reason, after their interview, to suppose it was changed; and he could
not wrong his employers by permitting them ignorantly to engage a bad
boy, especially when he had been questioned directly on the point.Towards evening Harry was sent with a bundle to a place in Boylston
Street, which required him to cross the Common.On his return, when he
reached the corner of the burying ground, Ben Smart, who had evidently
followed him, and lay in wait at this spot for him, sprang from his
covert upon him.The young villain struck him a heavy blow in the eye
before Harry realized his purpose.The blow, however, was vigorously
returned; but Ben, besides being larger and stronger than his victim,
had a large stone in his hand, with which he struck him a blow on the
side of his head, knocking him insensible to the ground.The wretch, seeing that he had done his work, fled along the side of
the walk of the burying ground, pursued by several persons who had
witnessed the assault.Ben was a fleet runner this time, and succeeded
in making his escape.CHAPTER XIX

IN WHICH HARRY FINDS THAT EVEN A BROKEN HEAD MAY BE OF SOME USE TO A
PERSON


When Harry recovered his consciousness, he found himself in an
elegantly furnished chamber, with several persons standing around the
bed upon which he had been laid.A physician was standing over him,
engaged in dressing the severe wound he had received in the side of
his head."There, young man, you have had a narrow escape," said the doctor, as
he saw his patient's eyes open.asked Harry, faintly, as he tried to concentrate his
wandering senses."You are in good hands, my boy.replied the sufferer, trying to
rise on the bed."Do you feel as though you could walk home?""I don't know; I feel kind of faint.""No, sir; it feels numb, and everything seems to be flying round."Harry expressed an earnest desire to go home, and the physician
consented to accompany him in a carriage to Mrs.He
had been conveyed in his insensible condition to a house in Boylston
Street, the people of which were very kind to him, and used every
effort to make him comfortable.A carriage was procured, and Harry was assisted to enter it; for he
was so weak and confused that he could not stand alone.Ben had struck
him a terrible blow; and, as the physician declared, it was almost a
miracle that he had not been killed.Flint and Katy were shocked and alarmed when they saw the
helpless boy borne into the house; but everything that the
circumstances required was done for him.he asked, when they had placed him on the bed."They will wonder what has become of me at the store," continued the
sufferer, whose thoughts reverted to his post of duty."I will go down to the store and tell them what has happened," said
Mr.Callender, the kind gentleman to whose house Harry had been
carried, and who had attended him to his home."Thank you, sir; you are very good.I don't want them to think that I
have run away, or anything of that sort.""They will not think so, I am sure," returned Mr.Callender, as he
departed upon his mission."Do you think I can go to the store to-morrow?"asked Harry, turning
to the physician."I am afraid not; you must keep very quiet for a time."He had never been sick a day in
his life; and it seemed to him just then as though the world could not
possibly move on without him to help the thing along.A great many
persons cherish similar notions, and cannot afford to be sick a single
day.I should like to tell my readers at some length what blessings come to
us while we are sick; what angels with healing ministrations for the
soul visit the couch of pain; what holy thoughts are sometimes kindled
in the darkened chamber; what noble resolutions have their birth in
the heart when the head is pillowed on the bed of sickness.But my
remaining space will not permit it; and I content myself with
remarking that sickness in its place is just as great a blessing as
health; that it is a part of our needed discipline.When any of my
young friends are sick, therefore, let them yield uncomplainingly to
their lot, assured that He who hath them in his keeping "doeth all
things well."Harry was obliged to learn this lesson; and when the pain in his head
began to be almost intolerable, he fretted and vexed himself about
things at the store.He was not half as patient as he might have been;
and, during the evening, he said a great many hard things about Ben
Smart, the author of his misfortune.I am sorry to say he cherished
some malignant, revengeful feelings towards him, and looked forward
with a great deal of satisfaction to the time when he should be
arrested and punished for his crime.Wade called upon him as soon as they heard of
his misfortune.They were very indignant when they learned that Harry
was suffering for telling the truth.They assured him that they should
miss him very much at the store, but they would do the best they
could--which, of course, was very pleasant to him.But they told him
they could get along without him, bade him not fret, and said his
salary should be paid just the same as though he did his work.Wade continued; "and, as it will cost you more to be sick,
we will raise your wages to four dollars a week."Certainly," replied the junior, warmly.There was no possible excuse for fretting now.With so many kind
friends around him, he had no excuse for fretting; but his human
nature rebelled at his lot, and he made himself more miserable than
the pain of his wound could possibly have made him.Flint, who
sat all night by his bedside, labored in vain to make him resigned to
his situation.It seemed as though the great trial of his lifetime had
come--that which he was least prepared to meet and conquer.His head ached, and the pain of his
wound was very severe.His moral condition was, if possible, worse
than on the preceding night.He was fretful, morose, and unreasonable
towards those kind friends who kept vigil around his bedside.Strange
as it may seem, and strange as it did seem to himself, his thoughts
seldom reverted to the little angel.Once, when he thought of her
extended on the bed of pain as he was then, her example seemed to
reproach him.She had been meek and patient through all her
sufferings--had been content to die, even, if it was the will of the
Father in heaven.With a peevish exclamation, he drove her--his
guardian angel, as she often seemed to him--from his mind, with the
reflection that she could not have been as sick as he was, that she
did not endure as much pain as he did.For several days he remained in
pretty much the same state.His head ached, and the fever burned in
his veins.His moral symptoms were not improved, and he continued to
snarl and growl at those who took care of him."Give me some cold water, marm; I don't want your slops," fretted he,
when Mrs."But the doctor says you mustn't have cold water."Give me a glass of cold water, and I will--"

The door opened then, causing him to suspend the petulant words; for
one stood there whose good opinion he valued more than that of any
other person.I am so sorry to see you so sick!"exclaimed Julia Bryant,
rushing to his bedside.She was followed by her father and mother; and Katy had admitted them
unannounced to the chamber.replied Harry, smiling for the first time since
the assault."Yes, Harry; I hope you are better.When I heard about it last night,
I would not give father any peace till he promised to bring me to
Boston.""Don't be so wild, Julia," interposed her mother."You forget that he
is very sick.""Forgive me, Harry; I was so glad and so sorry.I hope I didn't make
your head ache," she added, in a very gentle tone.It was very good of you to come and see me."Harry felt a change come over him the moment she entered the room.The
rebellious thoughts in his bosom seemed to be banished by her
presence; and though his head ached and his flesh burned as much as
ever, he somehow had more courage to endure them.Bryant had asked him a few questions, and expressed
their sympathy in proper terms, they departed, leaving Julia to remain
with the invalid for a couple of hours."I did not expect to see you, Julia," said Harry, when they had gone."Didn't you think I would do as much for you as you did for me?"I am only a poor boy, and you are a
rich man's child."You can't think how bad I
felt when father got Mr."It's a hard case to be knocked down in that way, and laid up in the
house for a week or two.""I know it; but we must be patient."I haven't any patience--not a bit.If I could get
hold of Ben Smart, I would choke him.I hope they will catch him and
send him to the state prison for life."These malignant words did not sound like those of
the Harry West she had known and loved.They were so bitter that they
curdled the warm blood in her veins, and the heart of Harry seemed
less tender than before."Harry," said she, in soft tones, and so sad that he could not but
observe the change which had come over her."No, I am sure you don't.asked he, deeply impressed by the sad and solemn
tones of the little angel."Forgive Ben Smart, after he has almost killed me?"Julia took up the
Bible, which lay on the table by the bedside--it was the one she had
given him--and read several passages upon the topic she had
introduced.The gentle rebuke she administered
touched his soul, and he thought how peevish and ill-natured he had
been."You have been badly hurt, Harry, and you are very sick.Now, let me
ask you one question: Which would you rather be, Harry West, sick as
you are, or Ben Smart, who struck the blow?""I had rather be myself," replied he, promptly."You ought to be glad that you are Harry West, instead of Ben Smart.Sick as you are, I am sure you are a great deal happier than he can
be, even if he is not punished for striking you."Here I have been
grumbling and growling all the time for four days.It is lucky for me that I am Harry, instead of Ben.""I am sure I have been a great deal better since I was sick than
before.When I lay on the bed, hardly able to move, I kept thinking
all the time; and my thoughts did me a great deal of good."Harry had learned his lesson, and Julia's presence was indeed an
angel's visit.For an hour longer she sat by his bed, and her words
were full of inspiration; and when her father called for her he could
hardly repress a tear as she bade him good night.Flint and Katy to forgive him for
being so cross, promising to be patient in the future.She read to him, conversed
with him about the scenes of the preceding autumn in the woods, and
told him again about her own illness.In the afternoon she bade him a
final adieu, as she was to return that day to her home.The patience and resignation which he had learned gave a favorable
turn to his sickness, and he began to improve.It was a month,
however, before he was able to take his place in the store again.Without the assistance of Julia, perhaps, he had not learned the moral
of sickness so well.As it was, he came forth from his chamber with
truer and loftier motives, and with a more earnest desire to lead the
true life.Ben Smart had been arrested; and, shortly after his recovery, Harry
was summoned as a witness at his trial.It was a plain case, and Ben
was sent to the house of correction for a long term.CHAPTER XX

IN WHICH HARRY PASSES THROUGH HIS SEVEREST TRIAL, AND ACHIEVES HIS
GREATEST TRIUMPH


Three years may appear to be a great while to the little pilgrim
through life's vicissitudes; but they soon pass away and are as "a
tale that is told."To note all the events of Harry's experience
through this period would require another volume; therefore I can only
tell the reader what he was, and what results he had achieved in that
time.It was filled with trials and temptations, not all of which were
overcome without care and privation.Often he failed, was often
disappointed, and often was pained to see how feebly the Spirit warred
against the Flesh.He loved money, and avarice frequently prompted him to do those things
which would have wrecked his bright hopes.That vision of the grandeur
and influence of the rich man's position sometimes deluded him,
causing him to forget at times that the soul would live forever, while
the body and its treasures would perish in the grave.As he grew
older, he reasoned more; his principles became more firmly fixed; and
the object of existence assumed a more definite character.He was an
attentive student, and every year not only made him wiser, but better.I do not mean to say that Harry was a remarkably good boy, that his
character was perfect, or anything of the kind.He meant well, and
tried to do well, and he did not struggle in vain against the trials
and temptations that beset him.I dare say those with whom he
associated did not consider him much better than themselves.It is
true, he did not swear, did not frequent the haunts of vice and
dissipation, did not spend his Sundays riding about the country; yet
he had his faults, and captious people did not fail to see them.He was still with Wake & Wade, though he was a salesman now, on a
salary of five dollars a week.Flint,
though Edward was no longer his room-mate.A year had been sufficient
to disgust his "fast" companion with the homely fare and homely
quarters of his father's house; and, as his salary was now eight
dollars a week, he occupied a room in the attic of a first-class
hotel.Harry was sixteen years old, and he had three hundred dollars in the
Savings Bank.He might have had more if he had not so carefully
watched and guarded against the sin of avarice.He gave some very
handsome sums to the various public charities, as well as expended
them in relieving distress wherever it presented itself.It is true,
it was sometimes very hard work to give of his earnings to relieve the
poor; and if he had acted in conformity with the nature he had
inherited, he might never have known that it was "more blessed to give
than to receive."As he grew older, and the worth of money was more
apparent, he was tempted to let the poor and the unfortunate take care
of themselves; but the struggle of duty with parsimony rendered his
gifts all the more worthy.Joe Flint had several times violated his solemn resolution to drink no
more ardent spirits; but Harry, who was his friend and confidant,
encouraged him, when he failed, to try again; and it was now nearly a
year since he had been on a "spree."Our hero occasionally heard from Rockville; and a few months before
the event we are about to narrate he had spent the pleasantest week of
his life with Julia Bryant, amid those scenes which were so full of
interest to both of them.As he walked through the woods where he had
first met the "little angel"--she had now grown to be a tall girl--he
could not but recall the events of that meeting.It was there that he
first began to live, in the true sense of the word.It was there that
he had been born into a new sphere of moral existence.Julia was still his friend, still his guiding star.Though the freedom
of childish intimacy had been diminished, the same heart resided in
each, and each felt the same interest in the other.The correspondence
between them had been almost wholly suspended, perhaps by the
interference of the "powers" at Rockville, and perhaps by the growing
sense of the "fitness of things" in the parties.But they occasionally
met, which amply compensated for the deprivations which propriety
demanded.But I must pass on to the closing event of my story--it was Harry's
severest trial, yet it resulted in his most signal triumph.He lived extravagantly, and
his increased salary was insufficient to meet his wants.When Harry
saw him drive a fast horse through the streets on Sundays, and heard
him say how often he went to the theatre, what balls and parties he
attended--when he observed how elegantly he dressed, and that he wore
a gold chain, a costly breastpin and several rings--he did not wonder
that he was "short."He lived like a prince, and it seemed as though
eight dollars a week would be but a drop in the bucket in meeting his
expenses.One day, in his extremity, he applied to Harry for the loan of five
dollars.Our hero did not like to encourage his extravagance, but he
was good-natured, and could not well avoid doing the favor, especially
as Edward wanted the money to pay his board.However, he made it the
occasion for a friendly remonstrance, and gave the spendthrift youth
some excellent advice.Edward was vexed at the lecture; but, as he
obtained the loan, he did not resent the kindly act.About a fortnight after, Edward paid him the money.It consisted of a
two-dollar bill and six half dollars.Harry was about to make a
further application of his views of duty to his friend's case, when
Edward impatiently interrupted him, telling him that, as he had got
his money, he need not preach.This was just before Harry went home to
dinner.Wake called him into the private office, and when
they had entered he closed and locked the door.Harry regarded this as
rather a singular proceeding; but, possessing the entire confidence of
his employers, it gave him no uneasiness.Wake began, "we have been losing money from the store for
the last year or more.I have missed small sums a great many times."exclaimed Harry, not knowing whether he was regarded as a
confidant or as the suspected person."To-day I gave a friend of mine several marked coins, with which he
purchased some goods."Now, we have four salesmen besides yourself."I can form no idea, sir," returned Harry."I can only speak for
myself.""Oh, well, I had no suspicion it was you," added Mr."I am going to try the same experiment again; and I want you to
keep your eyes on the money drawer all the rest of the afternoon."Wade took several silver coins from his pocket and scratched them
in such a way that they could be readily identified, and then
dismissed Harry, with the injunction to be very vigilant.When he came out of the office he perceived that Edward and Charles
Wallis were in close conversation."I say, Harry, what's in the wind?"asked the former, as our hero
returned to his position behind the counter.Harry evaded answering the question, and the other two salesmen, who
were very intimate and whose tastes and amusements were very much
alike, continued their conversation.They were evidently aware that
something unusual had occurred, or was about to occur.Soon after, a person appeared at the counter and purchased a dozen
spools of cotton, offering two half dollars in payment.Harry kept his
eye upon the money drawer, but nothing was discovered.From what he
knew of Edward's mode of life, he was prepared to believe that he was
the guilty person.The experiment was tried for three days in succession before any
result was obtained.The coins were always found in the drawer; but on
the fourth day, when they were very busy, and there was a great deal
of money in the drawer, Harry distinctly observed Edward, while making
change, take several coins from the till.The act appalled him; he
forgot the customer to whose wants he was attending, and hastened to
inform Mr."Only to the office," replied he; and his appearance and manner might
have attracted the attention of any skillful rogue."Come, Harry, don't leave your place," added Edward, playfully
grasping him by the collar, on his return."Don't stop to fool, Edward," answered Harry, as he shook him off and
took his place at the counter again.He was very absent-minded the rest of the forenoon, and his frame
shook with agitation as he heard Mr.But he trembled still more when he was summoned also, for it was very
unpleasant business."Of course, you will not object to letting me see the contents of
your pockets, Edward," said Mr."Certainly not, sir;" and he turned every one of his pockets inside
out.Not one of the decoy pieces was found upon him, or any other coins,
for that matter; he had no money.Wake was confused, for he fully
expected to convict the culprit on the spot."I suppose I am indebted to this young man for this," continued
Edward, with a sneer."I'll bet five dollars he stole the money
himself, if any has been stolen."Search me, sir, by all means," added Harry; and he began to turn his
pockets out.From his vest pocket he took out a little parcel wrapped in a shop
bill.I wasn't aware that there was any such thing in my
pocket.""But you seem to know more about it than Edward," remarked Mr.Wade,
as he took the parcel.The senior opened the wrapper, and to his surprise and sorrow found it
contained two of the marked coins.But he was not disposed hastily to
condemn Harry.He could not believe him capable of stealing; besides,
there was something in Edward's manner which seemed to indicate that
our hero was the victim of a conspiracy."As he has been so very generous towards me, Mr.Wake," interposed
Edward, "I will suggest a means by which you may satisfy yourself.My
mother keeps Harry's money for him, and perhaps, if you look it over,
you will find more marked pieces."Wake, I'm innocent," protested Harry, when he had in some measure
recovered from the first shock of the heavy blow."I never stole a
cent from anybody.""I don't believe you ever did, Harry.But can you explain how this
money happened to be in your pocket?"If you wish to look at my money, Mrs."Don't let him go with you, though," said Edward, maliciously.Flint, requesting her to exhibit the
money, and Harry signed it.sneered Edward, when he had gone."So you have been
watching me, I thought as much."Wade told me to do," replied Harry, exceedingly
mortified at the turn the investigation had taken.That is the way with you psalm-singers.Steal yourself, and
lay it to me!""I am sorry, Harry, to find that I have been mistaken in you.Is it
possible that one who is outwardly so correct in his habits should be
a thief?But your career is finished," said he, very sternly, as he
entered the office."Nothing strange to the rest of us," added Edward."I never knew one
yet who pretended to be so pious that did not turn out a rascal."Wake, I am neither a thief nor a hypocrite," replied Harry, with
spirit."I found four of the coins--four half dollars--which I marked first,
at Mrs.Flint's," said the senior, severely.Those half dollars were part of the money paid
him by Edward, and he so explained how they came in his possession.exclaimed Edward, with well-feigned surprise."I
never borrowed a cent of him in my life; and, of course, never paid
him a cent."Harry looked at Edward, amazed at the coolness with which he uttered
the monstrous lie.He questioned him in regard to the transaction, but
the young reprobate reiterated his declaration with so much force and
art that Mr.Our hero, conscious of his innocence, however strong appearances were
against him, behaved with considerable spirit, which so irritated Mr.Wake that he sent for a constable, and Harry soon found himself in
Leverett Street Jail.Strange as it may seem to my young friends, he
was not very miserable there.He was innocent, and he depended upon
that special Providence which had before befriended him to extricate
him from the difficulty.It is true, he wondered what Julia would say
when she heard of his misfortune.She would weep and grieve; and he
was sad when he thought of her.But she would be the more rejoiced
when she learned that he was innocent.The triumph would be in
proportion to the trial.On the following day he was brought up for examination.As his name
was called, the propriety of the court was suddenly disturbed by an
exclamation of surprise from an elderly man, with sun-browned face and
monstrous whiskers.almost shouted the elderly man, regardless of the dignity
of the court.An officer was on the point of turning him out; but his earnest manner
saved him.Wake, he questioned him in
regard to the youthful prisoner.muttered the elderly man, in the
most intense excitement.Harry had a friend who had not been idle,
as the sequel will show.Wake first testified to the facts we have already related, and the
lawyer, whom Harry's friends had provided, questioned him in regard to
the prisoner's character and antecedents.He was subjected to a severe cross-examination by Harry's
counsel, in which he repeatedly denied that he had ever borrowed or
paid any money to the accused.While the events preceding Harry's
arrest were transpiring, he had been absent from the city, but had
returned early in the afternoon.He disagreed with his partner in
relation to our hero's guilt, and immediately set himself to work to
unmask the conspiracy, for such he was persuaded it was.He testified that, a short time before, Edward had requested him to
pay him his salary two days before it was due, assigning as a reason
the fact that he owed Harry five dollars, which he wished to pay.He
produced two of the marked half dollars, which he had received from
Edward's landlady.Of course, Edward was utterly confounded; and, to add to his
confusion, he was immediately called to the stand again.This time his
coolness was gone; he crossed himself a dozen times, and finally
acknowledged, under the pressure of the skillful lawyer's close
questioning, that Harry was innocent.He had paid him the money found
in Mrs.Flint's possession, and had slipped the coins wrapped in the
shop bills into his pocket when he took him by the collar on his
return from the office.He had known for some time that the partners were on the watch for the
thief.He had heard them talking about the matter; but he supposed he
had managed the case so well as to exonerate himself and implicate
Harry, whom he hated for being a good boy.His heart swelled with gratitude for the kindly
interposition of Providence.The trial was past--the triumph had come.Wade, and other friends, congratulated him on the happy
termination of the affair; and while they were so engaged the elderly
man elbowed his way through the crowd to the place where Harry stood."Young man, what is your father's name?"he asked, in tones tremulous
with emotion."You had a father--what was his name?""Franklin West; a carpenter by trade.He went from Redfield to
Valparaiso when I was very young, and we never heard anything from
him."exclaimed the stranger, grasping our hero by the hand, while
the tears rolled down his brown visage.Harry did not know what to make of this announcement."Is it possible that you are my father?""I am, Harry; but I was sure you were dead.I got a letter, informing
me that your mother and the baby had gone; and about a year after I
met a man from Rockville who told me that you had died also."They continued the conversation as they walked from the court room to
the store.There was a long story for each to tell.West confessed
that, for two years after his arrival at Valparaiso, he had
accomplished very little.He drank hard, and brought on a fever, which
had nearly carried him off.But that fever was a blessing in disguise;
and since his recovery he had been entirely temperate.He had nothing
to send to his family, and shame prevented him from even writing to
his wife.He received the letter which conveyed the intelligence of
the death of his wife and child, and soon after learned that his
remaining little one was also gone.Carpenters were then in great demand in Valparaiso.He was soon in a
condition to take contracts, and fortune smiled upon him.He had
rendered himself independent, and had now returned to spend his
remaining days in his native land.He had been in Boston a week, and
happened to stray into the Police Court, where he had found the son
who, he supposed, had long ago been laid in the grave.Edward Flint finished his career of "fashionable dissipation" by being
sentenced to the house of correction.Just before he was sent over, he
confessed to Mr.Wade that it was he who had stolen Harry's money,
three years before.The next day Harry obtained leave of absence, for the purpose of
accompanying his father on a visit to Redfield.He was in exuberant
spirits.It seemed as though his cup of joy was full.He could hardly
realize that he had a father--a kind, affectionate father--who shared
the joy of his heart.They went to Redfield; but I cannot stop to tell my readers how
astonished Squire Walker, and Mr.Nason, and the paupers were, to see
the spruce young clerk come to his early home, attended by his
father--a rich father, too.We can follow our hero no farther through the highways and byways of
his life-pilgrimage.We have seen him struggle like a hero through
trial and temptation, and come off conqueror in the end.He has found
a rich father, who crowns his lot with plenty; but his true wealth is
in those good principles which the trials, no less than the triumphs,
of his career have planted in his soul.CHAPTER XXI

IN WHICH HARRY IS VERY PLEASANTLY SITUATED, AND THE STORY COMES TO AN
END


Perhaps my young readers will desire to know something of Harry's
subsequent life; and we will "drop in" upon him at his pleasant
residence in Rockville, without the formality of an introduction.The
years have elapsed since we parted with him, after his triumphant
discharge from arrest.His father did not live long after his return
to his native land, and when he was twenty-one, Harry came into
possession of a handsome fortune.But even wealth could not tempt him
to choose a life of idleness; and he went into partnership with Mr.Wade, the senior retiring at the same time.The firm of Wade and West
is quite as respectable as any in the city.Harry is not a slave to business; and he spends a portion of his time
at his beautiful place in Rockville; for the cars pass through the
village, which is only a ride of an hour and a half from the city.West's house is situated on a gentle eminence not far distant from
the turnpike road.It is built upon the very spot where the cabin of
the charcoal burners stood, in which Harry, the fugitive, passed two
nights.The aspect of the place is entirely changed, though the very
rock upon which our hero ate the sumptuous repast the little angel
brought him may be seen in the centre of the beautiful garden, by the
side of the house.West often seats himself there to think of the
events of the past, and to treasure up the pleasant memories connected
with the vicinity.The house is elegant and spacious, though there is nothing gaudy or
gay about it.It is plainly furnished, though the
articles are rich and tasteful.Who is that
beautiful lady sitting at the piano-forte?Do you not recognize her,
gentle reader?West, and an old
acquaintance.She is no longer the little angel, though I cannot tell
her height or her weight; but her husband thinks she is just as much
of an angel now as when she fed him on doughnuts upon the flat rock in
the garden.He is a fine-looking man, rather tall; and
though he does not wear a mustache, I have no doubt Mrs.West thinks
he is handsome--which is all very well, provided he does not think so
himself."This is a capital day, Julia; suppose we ride over to Redfield, and
see friend Nason," said Mr.The horse is ordered; and as they ride along, the gentleman amuses his
wife with the oft-repeated story of his flight from Jacob Wire's."Do you see that high rock, Julia?""That is the very one where I dodged Leman, and took the back track;
and there is where I knocked the bull-dog over."It is a pleasant little
cottage, for he is no longer in the service of the town.Connected with it is a fine farm of
twenty acres.Nason by his
protege, though no money was paid.Harry would have made it a free
gift, if the pride of his friend would have permitted; but it amounts
to the same thing.West and his lady are warmly welcomed by Mr.The ex-keeper is an old man now.He is a member of the church, and
considered an excellent and useful citizen.West
his "boy," and regards him with mingled pride and admiration.Our friends dine at the cottage; and, after dinner, Mr.West talk over old times, ride down to Pine Pleasant, and visit the
poorhouse.Squire Walker, Jacob
Wire, and most of the paupers who were the companions of our hero, are
dead and gone, and the living speak gently of the departed.At Pine Pleasant, they fasten the horse to a tree, and cross over to
the rock which was Harry's favorite resort in childhood."By the way, Harry, have you heard anything of Ben Smart lately?""After his discharge from the state prison, I heard that he went to
sea."They say she never smiled after she
gave him up as a hopeless case."I pity a mother whose son turns out badly.In their absence, a letter for Julia from Katy Flint
has arrived.Joe is a
steady man, and, with Harry's assistance, has purchased an interest in
the stable formerly kept by Major Phillips, who has retired on a
competency.asked Harry, as she broke the seal."Yes; he has just been sent to the Maryland penitentiary for
housebreaking.""Katy says her mother feels very badly about it."Flint is an excellent woman; she was a mother to
me.""She says they are coming up to Rockville next week.""Glad of that; they will always be welcome beneath my roof.I must
call upon them to-morrow when I go to the city.""Do; and give my love to them."And, here, reader, I must leave them--not without regret, I confess,
for it is always sad to part with warm and true-hearted friends; but
if one must leave them, it is pleasant to know that they are happy,
and are surrounded by all the blessings which make life desirable, and
filled with that bright hope which reaches beyond the perishable
things of this world.It is cheering to know that one's friends, after
they have fought a hard battle with foes without and foes within, have
won the victory, and are receiving their reward.If my young friends think well of Harry, let me admonish them to
imitate his virtues, especially his perseverance in trying to do well;
and when they fail to be as good and true as they wish to be, to TRY
AGAIN.THE END

NEW YORK, N. Y.Marvells than us good people do in a year.Oh, Edward Blore, Edward Blore, what weak
creatures we are!We are, sir--we are--'specially when we've got a tip, sir.Think of
the temptation of a tip, sir.Bonny Betsy's bound for to win the
'andicap.I know better; she can never get down the hill with those legs of
hers.She can, sir--what's to beat her?The horse in my stable--Dandy Dick!That old bit of ma'ogany, sir.They're layin' ten to one
against him.[_With hysterical eagerness._] Are they?Lord love you, sir--fur how much?[_Impulsively he crams the notes into
BLORE'S hand and then recoils in horror._] Oh![_Sinks into a chair with a groan._

BLORE.[_In a whisper._] Lor', who'd 'ave thought the Dean was such a ardent
sportsman at 'art?He dursn't give me my notice after this.[_To THE
DEAN._] Of course it's understood, sir, that we keep our little
weaknesses dark.Houtwardly, sir, we remain respectable, and, I 'ope,
respected.[_Putting the notes into his pocket._] I wish you
good-night, sir.THE DEAN makes an effort to
recall him but fails._] And that old man 'as been my pattern and
example for years and years!Oh, Edward Blore, your hidol is
shattered![_Turning to THE DEAN._] Good-night, sir.May your dreams
be calm and 'appy, and may you have a good run for your money![_BLORE goes out--THE DEAN gradually recovers his self-possession._

THE DEAN.I--I am upset to-night, Blore.I--I [_looking round._] Blore!If I don't call him back the
Spire may be richer to-morrow by five hundred pounds.[_Snatches a book at haphazard from the
bookshelf.There is the sound of falling rain and distant thunder._]
Rain, thunder.How it assimilates with the tempest of my mind![_Reading._] "The Horse and its
Ailments, by John Cox, M. R. C. V.It was with the aid of this
volume that I used to doctor my old mare at Oxford.[_Reading._] "Simple remedies for chills--the Bolus."The
helpless beast in my stable is suffering from a chill.If I allow Blore to risk my fifty pounds on Dandy Dick, surely it
would be advisable to administer this Bolus to the poor animal without
delay.[_Referring to the book hastily._] I have these drugs in my
chest.[_Going to the bell and
ringing._] I shall want help.[_He lays the book upon the table and goes into the Library._

_BLORE enters._

BLORE.The Dean's puzzling me
with his uncommon behavior, that he is.[_THE DEAN comes from the Library, carrying a large medicine chest.On
encountering BLORE he starts and turns away his head, the picture of
guilt._

THE DEAN.Blore, I feel it would be a humane act to administer to the poor
ignorant animal in my stable a simple Bolus as a precaution against
chill.I rely upon your aid and discretion in ministering to any guest
in the Deanery.[_In a whisper._] I see, sir--you ain't going to lose half a chance
for to-morrow, sir--you're a knowin' one, sir, as the sayin' goes![_Shrinking from BLORE with a groan._] Oh![_He places the medicine
chest on the table and takes up the book.Handing the book to BLORE
with his finger on a page._] Fetch these humble but necessary articles
from the kitchen--quick.[_BLORE goes out
quickly._] It is exactly seven and twenty years since I last
approached a horse medically.[_He takes off his coat and lays it on a
chair, then rolls his shirt-sleeves up above his elbows and puts on
his glasses._] I trust that this Bolus will not give the animal an
unfair advantage over his competitors.[_BLORE re-enters carrying a tray, on which are a small
flour-barrel and rolling-pin, a white china basin, a carafe of water,
a napkin, and the book.THE DEAN recoils, then guiltily takes the tray
from BLORE and puts it on the table._] Thank you.[_Holding on to the window curtain and watching THE DEAN._] His eyes
is awful; I don't seem to know the 'appy Deanery when I see such
proceedings a'goin' on at the dead of night.[_There is a heavy roll of thunder--THE DEAN mixes a pudding and stirs
it with the rolling-pin._

THE DEAN.The old half-forgotten time returns to me.I am once again a promising
youth at college.[_To himself._] One would think by his looks that he was goin' to
poison his family instead of--Poison!Oh, if hanything serious
'appened to the hanimal in our stable there would be nothing in the
way of Bonny-Betsy, the deservin' 'orse I've trusted with my
'ard-earned savings!I am walking once again in the old streets at Oxford, avoiding the
shops where I owe my youthful bills.[_He pounds away vigorously with the rolling-pin._

BLORE.[_To himself._] Where's the stuff I got a month ago to destroy the
hold black retriever that fell hill?The dog died--the poison's in my pantry--it couldn't have got used for
cooking purposes.I see the broad meadows and the tall Spire of the college--the Spire!Oh, my whole life seems made up of Bills and Spires![_To himself._] I'll do it![_Unseen by The Dean he quickly and quietly steals out by the door._

THE DEAN.[_Opening the medicine chest and
bending down over the bottles he pours some drops from a bottle into
the basin._] [_Counting._] Three--four--five--six.[_He replaces the
bottle and takes another._] How fortunate some animals are![_Counting._] One--two--three, four.[_Taking up the medicine chest he goes with it into the Library._

_As he disappears BLORE re-enters stealthily fingering a small paper
packet._

BLORE.[_In a whisper._] Strychnine![_There is a heavy roll of
thunder--BLORE darts to the table, empties the contents of the packet
into the basin, and stirs vigorously with the rolling-pin._] I've
cooked Dandy Dick![_He moves from the table
in horror._] Oh!I'm only a hamatoor sportsman and I can't afford a
uncertainty.[_As THE DEAN returns, BLORE starts up guiltily._] Can I
help you any more, Sir?No, remove these dreadful things, and don't let me see you again
to-night![_Sits with the basin on his knees, and proceeds to roll the paste._

BLORE.[_Removing the tray._] It's only an 'orse--it's only an 'orse!But
after to-morrow I'll retire from the Turf, if only to reclaim 'im.[_He goes out._

THE DEAN.[_Putting on his coat._] I don't contemplate my humane task with
resignation.The stable is small, and if the animal is restive we
shall be cramped for room.[_The rain is heard._] I shall get a chill
too.[_Seeing SIR TRISTRAM'S coat and cap lying upon the settee._] I
am sure Mardon will lend me this gladly.[_Putting on the coat, which
completely envelops him._] The animal may recognize the garment, and
receive me with kindly feeling.[_Putting on the sealskin cap, which
almost conceals his face._] Ugh!why do I feel this dreadful sinking
at the heart?[_Taking the basin and turning out the lamp._] Oh!if
all followers of the veterinary science are as truly wretched as I am,
what a noble band they must be![_The thunder rolls as he goes through the window curtains.SIR
TRISTRAM then enters quietly, smoking, and carrying a lighted candle._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Blowing out the candle._] I shall
doze here till daybreak.I never thought there was so
much thunder in these small country places.[_GEORGIANA, looking pale and agitated, and wearing a dressing-gown,
enters quickly, carrying an umbrella and a lighted candle._

GEORGIANA.I must satisfy myself--I
must--I must![_Going to the door._]

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Shrieks with fright._] Ah![_Holding out her umbrella._] Stand where you are or I'll fire![_Recognizing SIR TRISTRAM._] Tris!Oh, Tris, I've been dreaming![_Falling helplessly against Sir
Tristram, who deposits her in a chair._] Oh!I shall be on my legs again in a minute.[_She opens her umbrella and hides herself behind it, sobbing
violently._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Standing over the umbrella in great concern._] My goodness!Shall I trot you up and down outside?[_Sobbing._] What are you fooling about here for?Why can't
you lie quietly in your cot?Into the stable to sit with Dandy.The thunder's awful in my room;
when it gets tired it seems to sit down on my particular bit of roof.I did doze once, and then I had a frightful dream.I dreamt that Dandy
had sold himself to a circus, and that they were hooting him because
he had lost his tail.Don't, don't--be a man, George, be a man![_Shutting her umbrella._] I know I'm dreadfully effeminate.Ah, Tris--don't think me soft, old man.I'm a lonely, unlucky woman,
and the tail end of this horse is all that's left me in the world to
love and to cling to!I'm not such a mean cur as that!Swop halves and take his
head, George, my boy.I'm like a doating mother to my share of Dandy, and it's all
the dearer because it's an invalid.[_Turning towards the window, she following him, he
suddenly stops and looks at her, and seizes her hand._] George, I
never guessed that you were so tender-hearted.And you've robbed me to-night of an old friend--a pal.I mean that I seem to have dropped the acquaintance of George Tidd,
Esquire, forever.I have--but I've got an introduction to his twin-sister, Georgiana![_Snatching her hand away angrily._] Stay where you are; I'll nurse my
half alone.[_She goes towards the window, then starts back._] Hush![_Pointing to the window._] There.[_Peeping through the curtains._] You're right.[_SIR TRISTRAM takes the candlestick and they go out leaving the room
in darkness.The curtains at the window are pushed aside, and SALOME
and SHEBA enter; both in their fancy dresses._

SALOME.[_In a rage, lighting the candles on the mantelpiece._] Oh!If we only had a brother to avenge us!I shall try and borrow a brother to-morrow!Cold, wretched, splashed, in debt--for nothing!To think that we've had all the inconvenience of being wicked and
rebellious and have only half done it!It serves us right--we've been trained for clergymen's wives.Gerald Tarver's nose is inclined to pink--may it deepen and deepen
till it frightens cows![_Voices are heard from the curtained window recess._

DARBEY.[_Outside._] Miss Jedd--Sheba![_Outside._] Pray hear two wretched men![_In a whisper._] There they are.Shall we grant them a dignified interview?You curl your lip better than I--I'll dilate my nostrils.They are
both very badly and shabbily dressed as Cavaliers._

TARVER.[_A most miserable object, carrying a carriage umbrella._] Oh, don't
reproach us, Miss Jedd.It isn't our fault that the Military were
summoned to St.You don't blame officers and gentlemen for responding to the sacred
call of duty?We blame officers for subjecting two motherless girls to the shock of
alighting at the Durnstone Athenaeum to find a notice on the front
door: "Ball knocked on the head--Vivat Regina."We blame gentlemen for inflicting upon us the unspeakable agony of
being jeered at by boys.I took the address of the boy who suggested that we should call again
on the fifth of November.It is on the back of your admission card.We shall both wait on the boy's mother for an
explanation.Oh, smile on us once again, Miss Jedd--a forced, hollow smile, if you
will--only smile._GEORGIANA enters._

GEORGIANA.[_Weeping._] No, Aunt, no![_Advancing to TARVER._] How dare you encourage these two simple
children to enjoy themselves!How dare you take them out--without
their Aunt!Do you think _I_ can't keep a thing quiet?[_Shaking TARVER._] I'm speaking to you--Field-Marshal.We shall be happy to receive your representative in the morning.Guarding the ruins of the "Swan" Inn.You mustn't distract our
attention.Guarding the ruins of the "Swan," are you?[_SIR TRISTRAM appears._] Tris, I'm a feeble woman, but I
hope I've a keen sense of right and wrong.Run these outsiders into
the road, and let them guard their own ruins.[_SALOME and SHEBA shriek, and throw themselves at the feet of TARVER
and DARBEY.clinging to their legs._

SALOME.You shall not harm a hair of their heads.[_SIR TRISTRAM twists TARVER'S wig round so that it covers his face.The gate bell is heard ringing violently._

GEORGIANA, SALOME _and_ SHEBA.[_GEORGIANA runs to the door and opens it._

SALOME.[_To TARVER and DARBEY._] Fly![_TARVER and DARBEY disappear through the curtains at the window._

SHEBA.[_Falling into SALOME'S arms._] We have saved them!Oh, Tris, your man from the stable![_HATCHAM, carrying the basin with the bolus, runs in
breathlessly--followed by BLORE._

HATCHAM.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.The villain that set fire to the "Swan," sir--in the hact of
administering a dose to the 'orse!Topping the constable's collared him, Sir--he's taken him in a cart to
the lock-up!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.[_In agony._] They've got the Dean!The first scene is the interior of a country Police Station, a quaint
old room with plaster walls, oaken beams, and a gothic mullioned
window looking on to the street.A massive door, with a small sliding
wicket and an iron grating, opens to a prisoner's cell.The room is
partly furnished as a kitchen, partly as a police station, a copy of
the Police Regulations and other official documents and implements
hanging on the wall.It is the morning after the events of the
previous act._HANNAH, a buxom, fresh-looking young woman, in a print gown, has been
engaged in cooking while singing gayly._

HANNAH.[_Opening a door and calling with a slight dialect._] Noah darling![_From another room--in a rough, country voice._] Yaas!You'll have your dinner before you drive your prisoner over to
Durnstone, won't ye, darling?[_Closing the door._] Yaas!Noah's in a nice temper to-day over
summat.Ah well, I suppose all public characters is liable to
irritation.[_There is a knock at the outer door.HANNAH opening it,
sees BLORE with a troubled look on his face._] Well I never![_Entering and shaking hands mournfully._] How do you do, Mrs.And how is the dear Dean, bless him; the sweetest soul in the world?[_To HANNAH._] I--I 'aven't seen him this morning!Well, this is real kind of you, calling on an old friend, Edward.When
I think that I were cook at the Deanery seven years, and that since I
left you, to get wedded, not a soul of you has been nigh me, it do
seem hard.Well, you see, 'Annah, the kitchen took humbrage at your marryin' a
policeman at Durnstone.Topping's got the appointment of Head Constable at St.Marvells, what's that regarded as?A rise on the scales, 'Annah, a decided rise--but still you've honly
been a week in St.Marvells and you've got to fight your way hup.I think I'm as hup as ever I'm like to be.'Owever, Jane and Sarah and Willis the stable boy 'ave hunbent so far
as to hask me to leave their cards, knowin' I was a callin'.[_He produces from an old leather pocket-book three very dirty pieces
of paste-board, which he gives to HANNAH._

HANNAH.[_Taking them in her apron with pride._] Thank 'em kindly.We receive on Toosdays, at the side gate.[_Kissing her cheek._

HANNAH.When you was Miss Hevans there wasn't these social barriers,
'Annah!Noah's jealous of the very apron-strings what go round my
waist.I'm not so free and 'andy with my kisses now, I can tell you.Topping isn't indoors
now, surely![_Nodding her head._] Um--um!Why, he took a man up last night!Why, I thought that when hany harrest was made in St.Marvells, the
prisoner was lodged here honly for the night and that the 'ead
Constable 'ad to drive 'im over to Durnstone Police Station the first
thing in the morning.That's the rule, but Noah's behindhand to-day, and ain't going into
Durnstone till after dinner.And where is the hapartment in question?The "Strong-box" they call it in St.[_Whimpering to himself._] And 'im
accustomed to his shavin' water at h'eight and my kindly hand to
button his gaiters.'Annah, 'Annah, my dear, it's this very prisoner what I 'ave called on
you respectin'.Oh, then the honor ain't a compliment to me, after all, Mr.I'm killing two birds with one stone, my dear.[_Throwing the cards into BLORE'S hat._] You can take them back to the
Deanery with Mrs.[_Shaking the cards out of his hat and replacing them in his
pocket-book._] I will leave them hon you again to-morrow, 'Annah.But,
'Annah deary, do you know that this hunfortunate man was took in our
stables last night.No, I never ask Noah nothing about Queen's business.He don't want
_two_ women over him!Then you 'aven't seen the miserable culprit?I was in bed hours when Noah brought 'im 'ome.They tell us it's only a wretched poacher or a
petty larcery we'll get in St.My poor Noah ain't never
likely to have the chance of a horrid murder in a place what returns a
Conservative.[_Kneeling to look into the oven._

BLORE.But, 'Annah, suppose this case you've got 'old of now is a case
what'll shake old England to its basis!Suppose it means columns in
the paper with Topping's name a-figurin'!Suppose as family readin',
it 'old its own with divorce cases!You know something about this arrest, you do!I merely wish to encourage
you, 'Annah; to implant an 'ope that crime may brighten your wedded
life.[_Sitting at the table and referring to an official book._] The man
was found trespassing in the Deanery Stables with intent--refuses to
give his name or any account of 'isself.[_To himself._] If I could honly find hout whether Dandy Dick had any
of the medicine it would so guide me at the Races.It
doesn't appear that the 'orse in the stables--took it, does it?[_Looking up sharply._] Took what?You're sure there's no confession of any sort, 'Annah
dear?[_As he is bending over HANNAH, NOAH TOPPING appears.NOAH is a
dense-looking ugly countryman, with red hair, a bristling heard, and a
vindictive leer.He is dressed in ill-fitting clothes, as a rural
Police Constable._

NOAH.[_Fiercely._] 'Annah![_Starting and replacing the book._] Oh don't!Blore from
the Deanery come to see us--an old friend o' mine![_BLORE advances to NOAH with a nervous smile, extending his hand._

NOAH.[_Taking BLORE'S hand and holding it firmly._] A friend of hern is a
friend o' mian!She's gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends this week, since we coom to
St.Of course, dear 'Annah was a lovin' favorite with heverybody.Well then, as her friends be mian, I'm takin' the liberty, one by
one, of gradually droppin' on 'em all.[_Getting his hand away._] Dear me!And if I catch any old fly a buzzin' round my lady I'll venture to
break his 'ead in wi' my staff![_Preparing to depart._] I--I merely called to know if hanything had
been found hout about the ruffian took in our stables last night!He's the De-an, ain't he?[_Fiercely._] Shut oop, darlin'.Topping's
respects to the Dean, and say I'll run up to the Deanery and see him
after I've took my man over to Durnstone.Thank you--I 'ope the Dean will be at 'ome.[_Offering his hand, into which NOAH significantly places his
truncheon.BLORE goes out quickly._

HANNAH.[_Whimpering._] Oh, Noah, Noah, I don't believe as we shall ever get a
large circle of friends round us![_Selecting a pair of handcuffs and examining them
critically._] Them'll do.[_Slipping them into his pocket, and turning
upon HANNAH suddenly._] 'Annah!Yes, Noahry----

NOAH.Brighten oop, my darlin', the little time you 'ave me at 'ome with
you.[_She bustles about and begins to lay the cloth._

NOAH.I'm just a' goin' round to the stable to put old Nick in the cart.Oh, dont'ee trust to Nick, Noah dear--he's such a vicious brute.Nick can take me on to the edge o' the hill in half
the time.Ah, what d'ye think I've put off taking my man to Durnstone to now
for?Why, I'm a goin' to get a glimpse of the racin', on my way over.[_Opening the wicket in the cell door and looking in._] There he is![_To HANNAH._] Hopen the hoven door, 'Annah, and let the smell
of the cookin' get into him.Oh, no, Noah--it's torture![_She opens the oven door._] Torture!Whenever I get a 'old of a darned obstinate
creature wot won't reveal his hindentity I hopens the hoven door.[_He goes out into the street, and as he departs, the woful face of
THE DEAN appears at the wicket, his head being still enveloped in the
fur cap._

HANNAH.[_Shutting the oven door._] Not me!Torturing prisoners might a' done
for them Middling Ages what Noah's always clattering about, but not
for my time o' life.[_Crossing close to the
wicket, her face almost comes against THE DEAN'S.She gives a cry._]
The Dean![_He disappears._

HANNAH.[_Tottering to the wicket
and looking in._] Master!It's 'Annah, your poor faithful
servant, 'Annah![_The face of THE DEAN re-appears._

THE DEAN.[_In a deep sad voice._] Hannah Evans.It's 'Annah Topping, Knee Evans, wife o' the Constable what's goin' to
take you to cruel Durnstone.[_Sinking weeping upon the ground at the
door._] Oh, Mr.Dean, sir, what have you been up to?Woman, I am the victim of a misfortune only partially merited.[_On her knees, clasping her hands._] Tell me what you've done, Master
dear; give it a name, for the love of goodness

THE DEAN.My poor Hannah, I fear I have placed myself in an equivocal position.[_With a shriek of despair._] Ah!Is it a change o' cooking that's brought you to such ways?I cooked
for you for seven 'appy years!you seem to have lost none of your culinary skill.[_With clenched hands and a determined look._] Oh![_Quickly locking
and bolting the street door._] Noah can't put that brute of a horse to
under ten minutes.The dupplikit key o' the Strong Box![_Producing a
large key, with which she unlocks the cell door._] Master, you'll give
me your patrol not to cut, won't you?Under any other circumstances, Hannah, I should resent that
insinuation.[_Pulling the door which opens sufficiently to let out THE DEAN._

THE DEAN.[_As he enters the room._] Good day, Hannah; you have bettered
yourself, I hope?[_Hysterically flinging herself upon THE DEAN._] Oh, Master, Master![_Putting her from him sternly._] Hannah!Oh, I know, I know, but crime levels all, dear sir!You appear to misapprehend the precise degree of criminality which
attaches to me, Mrs.In the eyes of that majestic, but
imperfect instrument, the law, I am an innocent if not an injured man.Stick to it, if you think it's likely to serve
your wicked ends![_Placing bread with other things on the table._

THE DEAN.My good woman, a single word from me to those at the Deanery, would
instantly restore me to home, family, and accustomed diet.Ah, they all tell that tale what comes here.Why don't you send word,
Dean dear?Because it would involve revelations of my temporary moral aberration![_Putting her apron to her eyes with a howl._] Owh!Because I should return to the Deanery with my dignity--that priceless
possession of man's middle age!--with my dignity seriously impaired!Oh, don't, sir, don't!How could I face my simple children who have hitherto, not
unreasonably, regarded me as faultless?How could I again walk erect
in the streets of St.Marvells with my name blazoned on the Records of
a Police Station of the very humblest description?[_Sinking into a chair and snatching up a piece of breads which he
begins munching._

HANNAH.[_Wiping her eyes._] Oh, sir, it's a treat to hear you, compared with
the hordinary criminal class.But, master, dear, though my Noah don't
recognize you--through his being a stranger to St.Marvells--how'll
you fare when you get to Durnstone?I have one great buoyant hope--that a word in the ear of the Durnstone
Superintendent will send me forth an unquestioned man.You and he will
be the sole keepers of my precious secret.May its possession be a
lasting comfort to you both.Master, is what you've told me your only chance of getting off
unknown?It is the sole remaining chance of averting a calamity of almost
national importance.Then you're as done as that joint in my oven!The Superintendent at Durnstone--John Ruggles--also the two
Inspectors, Whitaker and Parker----

THE DEAN.Them and their wives and families are chapel folk![_THE DEAN totters across to a chair, into which he sinks with
his head upon the table._] Master!I was well fed and kept seven years at the
Deanery--I've been wed to Noah Topping eight weeks--that's six years
and ten months' lovin' duty doo to you and yours before I owe nothing
to my darling Noah.Master dear, you shan't be took to Durnstone!Hannah Topping, formerly Evans, it is my duty to inform you
that your reasoning does more credit to your heart than to your head.The Devil's always in a woman's heart because it's
the warmest place to get to![_Taking a small key from the table
drawer._] Here, take that![_Pushing the key into the pocket of his
coat._] When you once get free from my darling Noah that key unlocks
your handcuffs!How are you to get free, that's the question now, isn't it?My Noah drives you over to Durnstone with old Nick in the cart.Now Nick was formerly in the Durnstone Fire Brigade,
and when he 'ears the familiar signal of a double whistle you can't
hold him in.[_Putting it into THE DEAN'S
pocket._] Directly you turn into Pear Tree Lane, blow once and you'll
see Noah with his nose in the air, pullin' fit to wrench his 'ands
off.Jump out--roll clear of the wheel--keep cool and 'opeful and blow
again.Before you can get the mud out of your eyes Noah and the horse
and cart will be well into Durnstone, and may Providence restore a
young 'usband safe to his doatin' wife![_Recoiling horror-stricken._

HANNAH.[_Crying._] Oh--ooh--ooh!Is this the fruit of your seven years' constant cookery at the
Deanery?I wouldn't have done it, only this is your first offence!You're not too old; I want to give you another start in life!Woman, do you think I've no conscience?Do you think I
don't realize the enormity of the--of the difficulties in alighting
from a vehicle in rapid motion?[_Opening the oven and taking out a small joint in a baking tin, which
she places on the table._] It's 'unger what makes you feel
conscientious![_Waving her away._] I have done with you!With me, sir--but not with the joint!You'll feel wickeder when you've
had a little nourishment.[_He looks hungrily at the dish._] That's
right, Dean, dear--taste my darling Noah's favorite dish.[_Advancing towards the table._] Oh, Hannah Topping--Hannah Topping![_Clutching the carving-knife despairingly._] I'll have no more women
cooks at the Deanery![_Sitting and carving with desperation._

HANNAH.You can't blow that whistle on an empty
frame.[_THE DEAN begins to eat._] Don't my cooking carry you back,
sir?Ah, if every mouthful would carry me back one little hour I would
finish this joint![_NOAH TOPPING, unperceived by HANNAH and THE DEAN, climbs in by the
window, his eyes bolting with rage--he glares round the room, taking
in everything at a glance._

NOAH.[_Under his breath._] My man o' mystery--a waited on by my nooly made
wife--a heating o' my favorite meal.[_Touching HANNAH on the arm, she turns and faces him, speechless with
fright._

THE DEAN.[_Still eating._] If my mind were calmer this would be an
all-sufficient repast.[_HANNAH tries to speak, then clasps her hands
and sinks on her knees to NOAH._] Hannah, a little plain cold water in
a simple tumbler, please.[_Grimly--folding his arms._] 'Annah, hintrodooce me.[_HANNAH gives a
cry and clings to NOAH'S legs._

THE DEAN.[_Calmly to NOAH._] Am I to gather, constable, from your respective
attitudes that you object to these little kindnesses extended to me by
your worthy wife?I'm wishin' to know the name o' my worthy wife's friend.A friend o'
hern is a friend o' mian.She's gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends since we coom to St.I made this gentleman's acquaintance through the wicket, in a
casual way.Cooks and railins--cooks and railins!I might a guessed my wedded
life 'ud a coom to this.He spoke to me just as a strange gentleman ought to speak to a lady!Didn't you, sir--didn't you?Hannah, do not let us even under these circumstances prevaricate; such
is not quite the case![_NOAH advances savagely to THE DEAN.There is a knocking at the
door.--NOAH restrains himself and faces THE DEAN._

NOAH.Noa, this is neither the toime nor pla-ace, wi' people at the door and
dinner on t' table, to spill a strange man's blood.I trust that your self-respect as an officer of the law will avert
anything so unseemly.You've touched me on my point o' pride.There ain't
another police-station in all Durnstone conducted more strict and
rigid nor what mian is, and it shall so continue.You and me is a
goin' to set out for Durnstone, and when the charges now standin' agen
you is entered, it's I, Noah Topping, what'll hadd another![_There is another knock at the door._

HANNAH.The charge of allynating the affections o' my wife, 'Annah!Ay, and worse--the embezzlin' o' my mid-day meal prepared by her
'ands.[_Points into the cell._] Go in; you 'ave five minutes more in
the 'ome you 'ave ruined and laid waste.[_Going to the door and turning to NOAH._] You will at least receive
my earnest assurance that this worthy woman is extremely innocent?[_Points to the joint on the table._] Look theer![_THE
DEAN, much overcome, disappears through the cell door, which NOAH
closes and locks.To HANNAH,
pointing to the outer door._] Hunlock that door![_Weeping._] Oh, Noahry, you'll never be popular in St.[_HANNAH unlocks the door, and admits GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM, both
dressed for the race-course._

GEORGIANA.Take a chair, lady, near the fire.[_To SIR TRISTRAM._] Sit
down, sir.This is my first visit to a police-station, my good woman; I hope it
will be the last.Mary went back to the bathroom.Oh, don't say that, ma'am.We're honly hauxilliary 'ere, ma'am--the
Bench sets at Durnstone.I must say you try to make everybody feel at home.[_HANNAH curtseys._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To HANNAH._] Perhaps this is only a police-station for the young?No, ma'am, we take ladies and gentlemen like yourselves.[_Who has not been noticed, surveying GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM,
gloomily._] 'Annah, hintrodooce me.[_Facing NOAH._] Good gracious!'Annah's a gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends this week since we
coom to St.Noah, Noah--the lady and gentlemen is strange.Ay; are you seeing me on business or pleasure?Do you imagine people come here to see you?Noa--they generally coom to see my wife.'Owever, if it's business
[_pointing to the other side of the room_] that's the hofficial
side--this is domestic.SIR TRISTRAM _and_ GEORGIANA.[_Changing their seats._

SIR TRISTRAM.Tidman is the
sister of Dr.She's profligate--proceedins are pendin'![_To SIR TRISTRAM._] Strange police station![_To NOAH._] Well, my good man, to come to the point.My poor friend
and this lady's brother, Dr.Jedd, the Dean, you know--has
mysteriously and unaccountably disappeared.Now, look 'ere--it's no good a gettin' 'asty and irritable with the
law.I'll coom over to yer, officially.[_Putting the baking tin under his arm he crosses over to SIR TRISTRAM
and GEORGIANA._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Putting his handkerchief to his face._] Don't bring that horrible
odor of cooking over here.It's evidence against my profligate wife.[_SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA exchange looks of impatience._

GEORGIANA.Do you realize that my poor brother the Dean is missing?Touching this missin' De-an.I left him last night to retire to rest.'As it struck you to look in 'is bed?GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.It's only confusin'--hall doin' it![_GEORGIANA puts her handkerchief to her eyes._

SIR TRISTRAM.This is his sister--I am his
friend!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.A the'ry that will put you all out o' suspense!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.I've been a good bit about, I read a deal, and I'm a shrewd
experienced man.I should say this is nothin' but a hordinary case of
sooicide.[_GEORGIANA sits faintly._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Savagely to NOAH._] Get out of the way!Oh, Tris, if this were true how could we break it to the girls?I could run oop, durin' the evenin', and break it to the girls.[_Turns upon NOAH._] Look here, all you've got to do is to hold your
tongue and take down my description of the Dean, and report his
disappearance at Durnstone.[_Pushing him into a chair._] Go on!The Very Reverend Augustin Jedd, Dean of St.[_Softly to GEORGIANA._] Lady, lady.[_NOAH prepares to write, depositing the baking-tin on the table._

GEORGIANA.[_Speaks to GEORGIANA excitedly._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To NOAH._] Have you got that?[_Writing laboriously with his legs curled round the chair and his
head on the table._] Ay.I suppose he was jest the hordinary sort o' lookin' man.[_Turning from HANNAH, excitedly._] Description--a little, short, thin
man, with black hair and a squint![_To GEORGIANA._] No, no, he isn't.I'm Gus's sister--I ought to know what he's like!Good heavens, Georgiana--your mind is not going?[_Clutching SIR TRISTRAM'S arm and whispering in his ear, as she
points to the cell door._] He's in there!Gus is the villain found dosing Dandy Dick last night![_HANNAH seizes SIR TRISTRAM and talks to him
rapidly._] [_To NOAH._] What have you written?I've written "Hanswers to the name o' Gus!"[_Snatching the paper from him._] It's not wanted.I'm too busy to bother about him this week.Look here--you're the constable who took the man in the Deanery
Stables last night?[_Looking out of the window._] There's my cart outside ready to
take the scoundrel over to Durnstone.[_He tucks the baking-tin under his arm and goes up to the cell door._

GEORGIANA.[_To herself._] Oh, Gus, Gus![_Unlocking the door._] I warn yer.[_NOAH goes into the cell, closing the door after him._

Tris!What was my brother's motive in bolusing Dandy last night?The first thing to do is to get him out of this hole.But we can't trust to Gus rolling out of a flying dogcart!Why, it's
as much as I could do!Oh, yes, lady, he'll do it.There's another--a awfuller charge hangin' over his
reverend 'ead.To think my own stock should run vicious like this.[_NOAH comes out of the cell with THE DEAN, who is in handcuffs._

GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.[_Raising his eyes, sees SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA, and recoils with
a groan, sinking on to a chair._] Oh!I am the owner of the horse stabled at the Deanery.I
make no charge against this wretched person.[_To THE DEAN._] Oh man,
man!I was discovered administering to a suffering beast a simple remedy
for chills.The analysis hasn't come home from the chemist's yet.[_To NOAH._] Release this man.He was found trespassin' in the stables of the la-ate
De-an, who has committed sooicide.I----

SIR TRISTRAM, GEORGIANA _and_ HANNAH.The Diseased De-an is the honly man wot can withdraw one charge----

THE DEAN.SIR TRISTRAM, GEORGIANA _and_ HANNAH.And I'm the honly man wot can withdraw the other.I charge this person unknown with allynating the affections o' my wife
while I was puttin' my 'orse to.And I'm goin' to drive him over to
Durnstone with the hevidence.Oh lady, lady, it's appearances what is against us.[_Through the opening of the door._] Woa![_Whispering to THE DEAN._] I am disappointed in you, Angustin.Have
you got this wretched woman's whistle?[_Softly to THE DEAN._] Oh Jedd, Jedd--and these are what you call
Principles![_Appearing in the doorway._] Time's oop.May I say a few parting words in the home I have apparently wrecked?In setting out upon a journey, the termination of which is
problematical, I desire to attest that this erring constable is the
husband of a wife from whom it is impossible to withhold respect, if
not admiration.As for my wretched self, the confession of my weaknesses must be
reserved for another time--another place.[_To GEORGIANA._] To you,
whose privilege it is to shelter in the sanctity of the Deanery, I
give this earnest admonition.Within an hour from this terrible
moment, let the fire be lighted in the drawing-room--let the missing
man's warm bath be waiting for its master--a change of linen prepared.[_NOAH takes him by the arm and leads him out._

GEORGIANA.Oh, what am I to think of my brother?[_Kneeling at GEORGIANA'S feet._] Think!That he's the beautifullest,
sweetest man in all Durnshire!It's I and my whistle and Nick the fire-brigade horse what'll bring
him back to the Deanery safe and unharmed.Not a soul but we three'll
ever know of his misfortune.[_Rushing to the door and looking out._] He's done
for!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.Noah's put Kitty in the cart, and
left Old Nick at home!_The second scene is the Morning Room at the Deanery again._

_SALOME and SHEBA are sitting there gloomily._

SALOME.In the meantime it is such a comfort to feel that we have no
cause for self-reproach.[_Clinging to SALOME._] If I should pine and ultimately die of this
suspense I want you to have my workbox.[_Shaking her head and sadly turning away._] Thank you, dear, but if
Papa is not home for afternoon tea you will outlive me.[_Turning towards the window as MAJOR TARVER and MR.DARBEY appear
outside._

DARBEY.[_SALOME unfastens the window._

DARBEY.Don't be shocked when you see Tarver._TARVER and DARBEY enter, dressed for the Races, but DARBEY is
supporting TARVER, who looks extremely weakly._

TARVER.You do well, gentlemen, to intrude upon two feeble women at a moment
of sorrow.One step further, and I shall ask Major Tarver, who is nearest the
bell, to ring for help.[_TARVER sinks into a chair._

DARBEY.[_Standing by the side of TARVER._] There now.Miss Jedd,
that Tarver is in an exceedingly critical condition.Feeling that he
has incurred your displeasure he has failed even in the struggle to
gain the race-course.Middleton and I
explained that Major Tarver loved with a passion [_looking at SHEBA_]
second only to my own.[_Sitting comfortably on the settee._] Oh, we cannot listen to you,
Mr.[_The two girls exchange looks._

DARBEY.The Doctor made a searching examination of the Major's tongue and
diagnosed that, unless the Major at once proposed to the lady in
question and was accepted, three weeks or a month at the seaside would
be absolutely imperative.We are curious to see to what lengths you will go.The pitiable condition of my poor friend speaks for itself.I beg your pardon--it does nothing of the kind.[_Rising with difficulty and approaching SALOME._] Salome--I have
loved you distractedly for upwards of eight weeks.[_Going to him._] Oh, Major Tarver, let me pass; [_holding his coat
firmly_] let me pass, I say.[_DARBEY follows SHEBA across the room._

TARVER.To a man in my condition love is either a rapid and fatal malady, or
it is an admirable digestive.Accept me, and my merry laugh once more
rings through the Mess Room.Reject me, and my collection of vocal
music, loose and in volumes, will be brought to the hammer, and the
bird, as it were, will trill no more.And is it really I who would hush the little throaty songster?[_Taking a sheet of paper from his pocket._] I have the
Doctor's certificate to that effect.[_Both reading the certificate they walk into Library._

SHEBA.Darbey, I have never thought of marriage seriously.People never do till they _are_ married.Pardon me, Sheba--but what is your age?Oh, it is so very little--it is not worth mentioning.Cannot we remain
friends and occasionally correspond?Well, of course--if you insist----

SHEBA.No, no, I see that is impracticable.All I ask
is time--time to ponder over such a question, time to know myself
better.[_They separate as TARVER and SALOME re-enter the room.TARVER is
glaring excitedly and biting his nails._

TARVER.I never thought I should live to be accepted by anyone.DARBEY _and_ TARVER.Oh, what do you think of it, Mr.Shocking, but we oughtn't to condemn him unheard.[_At the window._] Here's Aunt Georgiana![_Going out quickly._

SALOME.[_Pulling TARVER after her._] Come this way and let us take cuttings
in the conservatory.[_They go out._

SHEBA.Darbey, wait for me--I have decided._Yes._

[_She goes out by the door as GEORGIANA enters excitedly at the
window._

GEORGIANA.[_Waving her handkerchief._] Come on, Tris!_SIR TRISTRAM and HATCHAM enter by the window carrying THE DEAN.They
all look as though they have been recently engaged in a prolonged
struggle._

SIR TRISTRAM.That I will, ma'am, and gladly.[_They deposit THE DEAN in a chair and GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM each
seize a hand, feeling THE DEAN'S pulse, while HATCHAM puts his hand on
THE DEAN'S heart._

THE DEAN.[_Opening his eyes._] Where am I now?SIR TRISTRAM _and_ HATCHAM

[_Quietly._] Hurrah![_To HATCHAM._] We can't shout here; go and cheer
as loudly as you can in the roadway by yourself.[_HATCHAM runs out at the window._

THE DEAN.[_Gradually recovering._] Georgiana--Mardon.How are you, Jedd, old boy?I feel as if I had been walked over carefully by a large concourse of
the lower orders![_HATCHAM'S voice is heard in the distance cheering.They all listen._

SIR TRISTRAM.That's Hatcham; I'll raise his wages.Do I understand that I have been forcibly and illegally rescued?A woman who would have been a heroine in any age--Georgiana!Georgiana, I am bound to overlook it, in a relative, but never let
this occur again.You found out that that other woman's plan went lame, didn't you?I discovered its inefficacy, after a prolonged period of ineffectual
whistling.But we ascertained the road the genial constable was going to follow.He was bound for the edge of the hill, up Pear Tree Lane, to watch the
Races.Directly we knew this, Tris and I made for the Hill.Bless your
soul, there were hundreds of my old friends there--welshers,
pick-pockets, card-sharpers, all the lowest race-course cads in the
kingdom.In a minute I was in the middle of 'em, as much at home as a
Duchess in a Drawing-room.Instantly
there was a cry of "Blessed if it ain't George Tidd!"Tears of real
joy sprang to my eyes--while I was wiping them away Tris had his
pockets emptied and I lost my watch.Ah, Jedd, it was a glorious moment!Tris made a back, and I stood on it, supported by a correct-card
merchant on either side."Dear friends," I said; "Brothers!You should have heard the shouts of honest welcome.Before I could obtain silence my field glasses had gone on their long
journey."A very dear relative of mine has
been collared for playing the three-card trick on his way down from
town.""He'll be on the brow of the
Hill with a bobby in half-an-hour," said I, "who's for the rescue?"A
dead deep silence followed, broken only by the sweet voice of a young
child, saying, "What'll we get for it?""A pound a-piece," said I.
There was a roar of assent, and my concluding words, "and possibly six
months," were never heard.At that moment Tris' back could stand it no
longer, and we came heavily to the ground together.[_Seizing THE DEAN
by the hand and dragging him up._] Now you know whose hands have led
you back to your own manger.[_Embracing him._] And oh, brother,
confess--isn't there something good and noble in true English sport
after all?But whence
is the money to come to reward these dreadful persons?I cannot
reasonably ask my girls to organize a bazaar or concert.Well, I've cleared fifteen hundred over the Handicap.Then the horse who enjoyed the shelter of the
Deanery last night----

SIR TRISTRAM.All the rest nowhere, and Bonny Betsy walked in
with the policeman.[_To himself._] Five hundred pounds towards the Spire!Oh, where is Blore with the good news!Sir Tristram, I am under the impression that your horse swallowed
reluctantly a small portion of that bolus last night before I was
surprised and removed.By the bye, I am expecting the analysis of that concoction every
minute.Spare yourself the trouble--the secret is with me.I seek no
acknowledgment from either of you, but in your moment of deplorable
triumph remember with gratitude the little volume of "The Horse and
its Ailments" and the prosaic name of its humane author--John Cox.[_He goes out through the Library._

GEORGIANA.But oh, Tris Mardon, what can I ever say to you?Why, you were the man who hauled Augustin out of the
cart by his legs!And when his cap fell off, it was you--brave
fellow that you are--who pulled the horse's nose-bag over my brother's
head so that he shouldn't be recognized.My dear Georgiana, these are the common courtesies of every-day life.They are acts which any true woman would esteem.Gus won't readily
forget the critical moment when all the cut chaff ran down the back of
his neck--nor shall I.

SIR TRISTRAM.Nor shall I forget the way in which you gave Dandy his whisky out of a
soda water bottle just before the race.That's nothing--any lady would do the same.You looked like the Florence Nightingale of the paddock!Oh,
Georgiana, why, why, why won't you marry me?Because you've only just asked me, Tris![_Goes to him cordially._

SIR TRISTRAM.But when I touched your hand last night, you reared!Yes, Tris, old man, but love is founded on mutual esteem; last night
you hadn't put my brother's head in that nose-bag.[_They go together to the fireplace, he with his arm round her waist._

SHEBA.[_Looking in at the door._] How annoying!There's Aunt and Sir
Tristram in this room--Salome and Major Tarver are sitting on the hot
pipes in the conservatory--where am I and Mr.[_She withdraws quickly as THE DEAN enters through the Library
carrying a paper in his hand; he has now resumed his normal
appearance._

THE DEAN.Home, with the secret of my
sad misfortune buried in the bosoms of a faithful few.Home, with the sceptre of my dignity still
tight in my grasp!What is this I have picked up on the stairs?[_Reads with a horrified look, as HATCHAM enters at the window._

HATCHAM.The chemist has just brought the annal_i_sis.[_SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA go out at the window, following HATCHAM._

THE DEAN.[_Reading._] "Debtor to Lewis Isaacs, Costumier to
the Queen, Bow Street--Total, Forty pounds, nineteen!"There was a
fancy masked ball at Durnstone last night!Salome--Sheba--no, no![_Bounding in and rushing at THE DEAN._] Papa, Papa![_SALOME seizes his hands, SHEBA his coat-tails, and turn him round
violently._

SALOME.Papa, why have you tortured us with anxiety?Before I answer a question, which, from a child to its parent,
partakes of the unpardonable vice of curiosity, I demand an
explanation of this disreputable document.[_Reading._] "Debtor to
Lewis Isaacs, Costumier to the Queen."[_SHEBA sits aghast on the table--SALOME distractedly falls on the
floor._

THE DEAN.I will not follow this legend in all its revolting intricacies.Suffice it, its moral is inculcated by the mournful total.[_Looking from one to the other._]
There was a ball at Durnstone last night.I trust I was better--that is, otherwise employed.[_Referring
to the bill._] Which of my hitherto trusted daughters was a lady--no,
I will say a person--of the period of the French Revolution?[_SHEBA points to SALOME._

THE DEAN.And a flower-girl of an unknown epoch.[_SALOME points to SHEBA._] To
your respective rooms![_The girls cling together._] Let your blinds
be drawn.At seven porridge will be brought to you.Papa, we, poor girls as we are, can pay the bill.Through the kindness of our Aunt----

SALOME.Is there no
conscience that is clear--is there no guilessness left in this house,
with the possible exception of my own![_Sobbing._] We always knew a little more than you gave us credit for,
Papa.[_Handing SHEBA the bill._] Take this horrid thing--never let it meet
my eyes again.As for the scandalous costumes, they shall be raffled
for in aid of local charities.Confidence, that precious pearl in the
snug shell of domesticity, is at an end between us.I chastise you
both by permanently withholding from you the reason of my absence from
home last night.[_The girls totter out as SIR TRISTRAM enters quickly at the window,
followed by GEORGIANA, carrying the basin containing the bolus.SIR
TRISTRAM has an opened letter in his hand._

SIR TRISTRAM.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.[_To GEORGIANA._] How dare you confront me without even the semblance
of a blush--you who have enabled my innocent babies, for the first
time in their lives, to discharge one of their own accounts.There isn't a blush in our family--if there were, you'd want it.[_SHEBA and SALOME appear outside the window, looking in._

SIR TRISTRAM.Jedd, you were once my friend, and you are to be my relative.[_Looking at GEORGIANA._] My sister![_To SIR TRISTRAM._] I offer no
opposition.But not even our approaching family tie prevents my designating you as
one of the most atrocious conspirators known in the history of the
Turf.As the owner of one-half of Dandy Dick, I denounce you!As the owner of the other half, _I_ denounce you!_SHEBA and SALOME enter, and remain standing in the recess,
listening._

SIR TRISTRAM.The chief ingredient of your infernal preparation is known.It contains nothing that I would not cheerfully administer to my own
children.[_Pointing to the paper._] Strychnine![_Clinging to each other terrified._] Oh!Summon my devoted servant Blore, in whose presence the
innocuous mixture was compounded.[_GEORGIANA rings the bell.The
girls hide behind the window curtains._] This analysis is simply the
pardonable result of over-enthusiasm on the part of our local chemist.You're a disgrace to the pretty little police station where you slept
last night![_BLORE enters and stands unnoticed._

THE DEAN.I will prove that in the Deanery Stables the common laws of
hospitality have never been transgressed.[_GEORGIANA hands THE DEAN the basin from the table._] A simple remedy
for a chill.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.I, myself, am suffering from the exposure of last night.[_Taking the
remaining bolus and opening his mouth._] Observe me![_Rushing forward, snatching the basin from THE DEAN and sinking on to
his knees._] No, no!You wouldn't 'ang the holdest
servant in the Deanery.I 'ad a honest fancy for Bonny Betsy, and I wanted this
gentleman's 'orse out of the way.And while you was mixing the dose
with the best ecclesiastical intentions, I hintroduced a foreign
element.[_Pulling BLORE up by his coat collar._] Viper!Oh sir, it was hall for the sake of the Dean.The dear Dean had only Fifty Pounds to spare for sporting purposes,
and I thought a gentleman of 'is 'igh standing ought to have a
certainty.I can conceal it no longer--I--I instructed this unworthy creature to
back Dandy Dick on behalf of the Restoration Fund.[_Shaking BLORE._] And didn't you do it?In the name of that tottering Spire, why not?Oh, sir, thinking as you'd given some of the mixture to Dandy I put
your cheerful little offering on to Bonny Betsy.[_SALOME and SHEBA disappear._

THE DEAN.[_To BLORE._] I could have pardoned everything but this last act
of disobedience.If I leave the Deanery, I shall give my reasons, and then what'll
folks think of you and me in our old age?Not if sober, sir--but suppose grief drove me to my cups?I must save you from intemperance at any cost.Remain in my service--a
sad, sober and, above all, a silent man![_SALOME and SHEBA appear as BLORE goes out through the window._

SALOME.Darbey!----

THE DEAN.If you have sufficiently merged all sense of moral rectitude as to
declare that I am not at home, do so.Papa; we have accidentally discovered that you, our parent,
have stooped to deception, if not to crime.We are still young--the sooner, therefore, we are removed from any
unfortunate influence the better.We have an opportunity of beginning life afresh.These two gallant gentlemen have proposed for us.[_He goes out rapidly, followed by SALOME and SHEBA.Directly they
have disappeared, NOAH TOPPING, looking dishevelled, rushes in at the
window, with HANNAH clinging to him._

NOAH.[_Glaring round the room._] Is this 'ere the Deanery?[_GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM come to him._

HANNAH.Theer's been a man rescued from my lawful custody while my face was
unofficially held downwards in the mud.The villain has been traced
back to the Deanery.The man was a unknown lover of my nooly made wife!You mustn't bring your domestic affairs here; this is a subject for
your own fireside of an evening.[_THE DEAN appears outside the window with SALOME, SHEBA, TARVER and
DARBEY._

THE DEAN.[_Outside._] Come in, Major Tarver--come in, Mr._THE DEAN enters, followed by SALOME, TARVER, SHEBA and DARBEY._

NOAH.[_Confronting THE DEAN._] My man.I'm speaking to the man I took last night--the culprit as 'as
allynated the affections of my wife.[_Going out at the window._

[_SALOME and TARVER go into the Library and sit at the writing-table.DARBEY sits in an arm-chair with SHEBA on the arm._

THE DEAN.[_Mildly._] Do not let us chide a man who is conscientious even in
error.[_Looking at HANNAH._] I think I see Hannah Evans, once an
excellent cook under this very roof.Topping now, sir--bride o' the constable.And oh, do forgive
him--he's a mass o' ignorance.[_HANNAH returns to NOAH.as SIR TRISTRAM re-enters with HATCHAM._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To HATCHAM._] Hatcham--[_pointing to THE DEAN_]--Is that the man you
and the Constable secured in the stable last night?Bless your 'art, sir, that's the Dean 'imself.[_To NOAH._] Why, our man was a short, thin individual![_HATCHAM goes out at the window._

THE DEAN.[_To NOAH._] I trust you are perfectly satisfied.[_Wiping his brow and looking puzzled._] I'm doon.I withdraw unreservedly any charge against this
unknown person found on my premises last night.I attribute to him the
most innocent intentions.Hannah, you and your worthy husband will
stay and dine in my kitchen.[_Turning angrily to HANNAH._] Now then, you don't know a real
gentleman when you see one.Why don't 'ee thank the Dean warmly?[_Kissing THE DEAN'S hands with a curtsey._] Thank you, sir.[_Benignly._] Go--go.[_They back out, bowing and curtseying._

GEORGIANA.Well, Gus, you're out of all your troubles.My family influence gone forever--my dignity crushed out of all
recognition--the genial summer of the Deanery frosted by the winter of
Deceit.Ah, Gus, when once you lay the whip about the withers of the horse
called Deception he takes the bit between his teeth, and only the
devil can stop him--and he'd rather not.Shall I tell you who has been
riding the horse hardest?[_SHEBA sits at the piano and plays a bright air softly--DARBEY
standing behind her--SALOME and TARVER stand in the archway._

GEORGIANA.[_Slapping THE DEAN on the back._] Look here, Augustin, George Tidd
will lend you that thousand for the poor, innocent old Spire.[_Taking her hand._] Oh, Georgiana!On one condition--that you'll admit there's no harm in our laughing at
a Sporting Dean.My brother Gus doesn't want us to be merry at his expense.[_They both laugh._

THE DEAN.[_Trying to silence them._] No, no!Why, Jedd, there's no harm in laughter, for those who laugh or those
who are laughed at.Provided always--firstly, that it is Folly that is laughed at and not
Virtue; secondly, that it is our friends who laugh at us, [_to the
audience_] as we hope they all will, for our pains.THE END

-  Before and within dialogue.-  Flush right, on the same line as the end of dialogue if there was
enough space; on the next line, if there was not.-  If the stage directions were two lines, they were indented from the

indented varied.In the etext, all stage directions not before or within dialogue are

for scarcely had the third dozen commenced when Tommie's cries were
hushed, his head drooped on his shoulder like a little dead bird's, and
for a while his sufferings were at an end.I gladly took the
opportunity to report further proceedings as dangerous, and he was
carried away to his hammock.I will not shock the nerves and feelings of the reader by any further
relation of the horrors of flogging, merely adding, that I consider
corporal punishment, as applied to men, _cowardly, cruel_, and debasing
to human nature; and as applied to boys, _brutal_, and sometimes even
_fiendish_.There is only one question I wish to ask of every
true-hearted English lady who may read these lines--Be you sister, wife,
or mother, could you in your heart have respected the commander who,
with folded arms and grim smile, replied to poor Tommie's frantic
appeals for mercy, "Continue the punishment"?The pay of medical officers is by no means high enough to entice young
doctors, who can do anything like well on shore, to enter the service.Ten shillings a day, with an increase of half-a-crown after five years'
service on full pay, is not a great temptation certainly.To be sure
the expenses of living are small, two shillings a day being all that is
paid for messing; this of course not including the wine-bill, the size
of which will depend on the "drouthiness" of the officer who contracts
it.Government provides all mess-traps, except silver forks and spoons.Then there is uniform to keep up, and shore-going clothes to be paid
for, and occasionally a shilling or two for boat-hire.However, with a
moderate wine-bill, the assistant-surgeon may save about four shillings
or more a day.Promotion to the rank of surgeon, unless to some fortunate individuals,
comes but slowly; it may, however, be reckoned on after from eight to
ten years.A few gentlemen out of each "batch" who "pass" into the
service, and who have distinguished themselves at the examination, are
promoted sooner.It seems to be the policy of the present Director-General to deal as
fairly as possible with every assistant-surgeon, after a certain
routine.On first joining he is sent for a short spell--too short,
indeed--to a hospital.He is then appointed to a sea-going ship for a
commission--say three years--on a foreign station.On coming home he is
granted a few months' leave on full pay, and is afterwards appointed to
a harbour-ship for about six months.By the end of this time he is
supposed to have fairly recruited from the fatigues of his commission
abroad; he is accordingly sent out again to some other foreign station
for three or four years.On again returning to his native land, he
might be justified in hoping for a pet appointment, say to a hospital,
the marines, a harbour-ship, or, failing these, to the Channel fleet.On being promoted he is sent off abroad again, and so on; and thus he
spends his useful life, and serves his Queen and country, and earns his
pay, and generally spends that likewise.Pensions are granted to the widows of assistant-surgeons--from forty to
seventy pounds a year, according to circumstances; and if he leaves no
widow, a dependent mother, or even sister, may obtain the pension.But
I fear I must give, to assistant-surgeons about to many, Punch's advice,
and say most emphatically, "Don't;" unless, indeed, the dear creature
has money, and is able to purchase a practice for her darling doctor.With a little increase of pay ungrudgingly given, shorter commissions
abroad, and less of the "bite and buffet" about favours granted, the
navy would be a very good service for the medical officer.However, as it is, to a man who has neither wife nor riches, it is, I
dare say, as good a way of spending life as any other; and I do think
that there are but few old surgeons who, on looking back to the life
they have led in the navy, would not say of that service,--"With all thy
faults I love thee still."Nor did it end when, arriving at the "ideal" lodgings, and being
received with a placidity which we felt we had not quite deserved, and
fed in a manner which reflected much credit not only on the cook's
skill, but her temper--we sallied out to see the place.A high plain, with the sparkling sea
beyond it; the principal object near being the Lizard Lights, a huge
low building, with a tower at either side, not unlike the Sydenham
Crystal palace, only dazzling white, as every building apparently was
at the Lizard."We'll go out and adventure," cried the young folks; and off
they started down the garden, over a stile--made of serpentine
of course--and across what seemed a field, till they disappeared
mysteriously where the line of sea cut the line of cliffs, and were
heard of no more for two hours.They had found such
a lovely little cove, full of tiny pools, a perfect treasure-house
of sea-weeds and sea-anemones; and the rocks, so picturesque, and
"so grand to scramble over."(I must confess that to these, my
practically-minded "chickens," the picturesque or the romantic always
ranked second to the fun of a scramble.)The descent to this marine
paradise also seemed difficult enough to charm anybody."But _you_ wouldn't do it.You would break all your
legs and arms, and sprain both your ankles."Alas, for a hen--and an old hen--with ducklings!But mine, though
daring, were not rash, and had none of that silly fool-hardiness
which for the childish vanity of doing, or of saying one has done, a
dangerous thing, risks health, comfort, life, and delights selfishly
in making other people utterly miserable.So, being feeble on my feet,
though steady in my head, I agreed to sit like a cormorant on the
nearest cliff, and look down placidly upon the young adventurers in
their next delightful scramble.It could not be to-night, however, for the tide was coming in fast; the
fairy cove would soon be all under water.It will soon be sunset and moon-rise; we can
watch both from the sea."Its broad circle had no other bound than the shores of
America, and its blueness, or the strange, changing tint often called
blue, almost equalled the blue of the Mediterranean."Yes, ma'am, it's a fine evening for a row," said the faithful Charles."And it isn't often you can get a row here; the sea is so rough, and
the landing so difficult.But there's a man I know; he has a good
boat, he knows the coast well, and he'll not go out unless it's really
safe."This seemed ultra-prudent, with such a smiling sky and sea; but we
soon found it was not unnecessary at the Lizard.Indeed all along the
Cornish coast the great Atlantic waves come in with such a roll or a
heavy ground-swell, windless, but the precursor of a storm that is
slowly arriving from across the ocean, that boating here at best is no
child's play.We had been fair-weather sailors, over shut-in lochs or smooth rivers;
all of us could handle an oar, or had handled it in old days, but
this was a different style of thing.Descending the steep zigzag path
to the next cove--the only one where there was anything like a fair
landing--we found we still had to walk through a long bed of sea-weed,
and manage somehow to get into the boat between the recoil and advance
of a wave.Not one of the tiny waves of quiet bays, but an Atlantic
roller, which, even if comparatively small and tame, comes in with a
force that will take you off your feet at any time.However, we managed it, and found ourselves floating among an
archipelago of rocks, where the solemn cormorants sat in rows, and
affectionate families of gulls kept swimming about in a large flotilla
of white dots on the dark water.Very dark the sea was: heaving and
sinking in great hills and valleys, which made rowing difficult.Also,
for several yards round every rock extended a perfect whirlpool of
foaming waves, which, if any boat chanced to be caught therein, would
have dashed it to pieces in no time.But our boatmen seemed used to the
danger, and took us as near it as possible, without actually running
into it.They were both far from commonplace-looking men, especially the elder,
our stroke-oar.Being rather given to ethnological tastes, we had
already noticed the characteristic Cornish face, not unlike the Norman
type, and decidedly superior to that of the inland counties of England.But this was a face by itself, which would have attracted any artist or
student of human nature; weather-beaten, sharp-lined, wrinkled as it
was--the man must have been fully sixty--there was in it a sweetness,
an absolute beauty, which struck us at once.The smile, placid and
paternal, came often, though words were few; and the keen, kindly eyes
were blue as a child's, or as Tennyson describes King Arthur's."I can imagine," whispered one of us who had imaginative tendencies,
"that King Arthur might have looked thus, had he lived to grow old.""I don't believe King Arthur ever lived at all," was the knock-me-down
utilitarian answer, to which the other had grown accustomed and
indifferent.Nevertheless, there was such a refinement about the man,
spite of his rough fisherman's dress, and he had been so kind to the
young folks, so considerate to "the old lady," as Cornish candour
already called me, that, intending to employ him again, we asked his
name.We made several hopeless plunges at it, and finally asked
him to spell it."Cur-gen-ven," said he; adding, with a slight air of pride, "one of the
oldest families in Cornwall."(I have no hesitation in stating this, because, when we afterwards
became great friends, I told John Curgenven I should probably "put
him in a book"--if he had no objection.To which he answered with his
usual composure, "No, he did not think it would harm him."He evidently
considered "writing a book" was a very inferior sort of trade.)But looking at him, one could not help speculating as to how far the
legend of King Arthur had been really true, and whether the type of
man which Tennyson has preserved--or created--in this his "own ideal
knight," did once exist, and still exists, in a modified modern form,
throughout Cornwall.A fancy upon which we then only argued; now I, at
least, am inclined to believe it."There is Lord Brougham's head, his wig and his turn-up nose, you can
see all distinctly.At least, you could if there was light enough."But there was not light, for the sun was setting, and the moon only
just rising.Black looked the heaving sea, except where rings of white
foam encircled each group of rocks, blacker still.And blackest of all
looked the iron-bound coast, sharp against the amber western sky."Yes, that's Kynance Cove, and the Gull Rock and Asparagus Island.Two miles there, and two back, through this angry sea, and then to land
in the dim light about 9 p.m.!We did not own this;
we merely remarked that we would rather see Kynance by daylight, but I
think each of us felt a sensation of relief when the boat's head was
turned homewards.Many a night afterwards we watched
the same scene, but never lovelier than that night, the curved line
of coast traceable distinctly up to Mount's Bay, and then the long
peninsula which they told us was the Land's End, stretching out into
the horizon, where sea and sky met in a mist of golden light, through
which the sun was slowly dropping right from the sky into the sea.Beyond was a vague cloud-land, which might be the fair land of Lyonesse
itself, said still to lie there submerged, with all its cities and
towers and forests; or the "island-valley of Avillion," whither Arthur
sailed with the three queens to be healed of his "grievous wound," and
whence he is to come again some day.Popular superstition still expects
him, and declares that he haunts this coast even now in the shape of a
Cornish chough.Modern ghosts, too, exist, decidedly more alarming."Look up there, ladies, that green <DW72> is Pistol Meadow."Two hundred and more of foreign sailors, whose ship went to pieces in
the little cove below.They're buried under the green mounds you see.Out of a crew of seven hundred only two men were washed ashore alive,
and they were in irons, which the captain had put on them because
they said he was going too near in shore.It was called Pistol Meadow
because most of 'em were found with pistols in their hands, which may
have been true or may not, since it happened more than a hundred years
ago.However, there are the green mounds, you see, and Lizard folk
don't much like passing the place after dark.""Oh, us and the coast-guards!Us goes anywhere,
at all hours, and never meets nothing.D'ye see those white marks all
along the coast every few yards?They're rocks, kept white-washed, to
guide the men of dark nights between here and Kynance.It's a ticklish
path, when all's as black as pitch, with a stiff wind blowing."One almost shuddered at the idea, and then
felt proud of the steady heads and cool courage of these coast-guard
men--always the pick of the service, true Englishmen, fearless
and faithful--the business of whose whole lives is to save other
lives--that is, now that smuggling has abated, and those dreadful
stories once current all along the coast of Cornwall have become
mostly legends of the past.No tales of wreckers, or of fights between
smugglers and revenue officers, reached our ears, but the stories of
shipwrecks were endless.Every winter, and many times through the
winter, some ghastly tragedy had happened.Every half-mile along this
picturesque shore was recorded the place where some good ship went to
pieces, often with the brief addendum, "all hands lost."Look out for the Lizard Lights," called out
Charles, who sat in the bow of the boat in faithful attendance upon his
"ladies,"--another Knight of the Round Table in humble life--we met
many such in Cornwall.And sure enough, the instant the sun's last spark was quenched in
the sea, into which he dropped like a red round ball, out burst two
substitute suns, and very fair substitutes too, making the poor little
moon in the east of no importance whatever.The gleam of them extended
far out upon the darkening ocean, and we could easily believe that
their light was "equal to 20,000 candles," and that they were seen out
at sea to a distance of twenty, some said even thirty, miles."Except in a fog; and the fogs at the Lizard are very bad.Then you
can see nothing, not even the Lights, but they keep sounding the
fog-horn every minute or so.It works by the same machinery as works
the Lights--a big steam-engine; you can hear it bum-bumming now, if you
listen."So we could, a mysterious noise like that of a gigantic bumble-bee,
coming across the water from that curious building, long and white,
with its two towers and those great eyes in each of them, at either end."They're wonderful bright;" said John Curgenven; "many's the time I've
sat and read my newspaper by them a quarter of a mile off.They're seen
through the blackest night, the blacker the brighter, seen through
everything--except fog.Now, ladies, d'ye think you can jump ashore?"Some of us did, airily enough, though it required to choose your
moment pretty cleverly so as to escape the incoming wave.And some of
us--well, we accepted the inevitable, and were only too thankful to
scramble anyhow, wet or dry, on terra firma.And then we had to ascend the zigzag path, slippery with loose stones,
and uncertainly seen in the dim half-twilight, half-moonlight.At
last we came out safe by the life-boat house, which we had noticed in
passing, with the slit in its door for "Contributions," and a notice
below that the key was kept at such and such a house--I forget the
man's name--"and at the Rectory."[Illustration: THE LIZARD LIGHTS BY NIGHT.]"Yes," said Curgenven, "in many places along this coast, when there's a
wreck, and we're called out, the parson's generally at the head of us.Of course we're all volunteers, except the coast-guard, who
are paid.But they're often glad enough of us and of our boats too.They keep her here, the only place they can,
but it's tough work running her down to the beach on a black winter's
night, with a ship going to pieces before your eyes, as ships do here
in no time.I've seen it myself--watched her strike, and in ten minutes
there was not a bit of her left."Even on this calm evening the waves kept
dashing themselves against every rock with a roar and a swell and a
circle of boiling foam.What must it be on a stormy winter night, or
through the deathly quiet of a white mist, with nothing visible or
audible except the roar of the waters and the shriek of the fog-horn!"I think it's full time we were in-doors," suggested a practical and
prudent little voice; "we can come again and see it in the daylight."That's the way you came, Miss," said Charles, "but I can take you a
much shorter one on the top of the hedges"--or edges, we never quite
knew which they were, though on the whole the letter _h_ is tolerably
well treated in Cornwall.These "hedges" were startling to any one not Cornish-born.In the
Lizard district the divisions of land are made not by fences, but by
walls, built in a peculiar fashion, half stones, half earth, varying
from six to ten feet high, and about two feet broad.On the top of this
narrow giddy path, fringed on either side by deceitful grass, you are
expected to walk!--in fact, are obliged to walk, for there is often no
other road.Once upon a time I could have walked upon
walls as well as anybody, but now--!"I'll help you, ma'am; and I'm sure you can manage it," said Charles
consolingly."It's only three-quarters of a mile."Three-quarters of a mile along a two-foot path on the top of a wall,
and in this deceitful light, when one false step would entail a certain
fall.And at my age one doesn't fall exactly like a feather or an
india-rubber ball."Ma'am, if you go slow and steady, with me before and Curgenven behind,
you'll _not_ fall."Nor did I. I record it with gratitude to those two honest men--true
_gentlemen_, such as I have found at times in all ranks--who never
once grumbled or relaxed in their care of their tardy and troublesome
charge; one instance more of that kindly courtesy which it does any
man good to offer, and which any woman, "lady" though she be, may feel
proud to receive.When we reached "home," as we had already begun to call it, a smiling
face and a comfortable tea justified the word.And when we retired,
a good deal fatigued, but quite happy, we looked out upon the night,
where the fiery stream of the Lizard Lights was contending with the
brightest of harvest moons.It was a hopeful ending of our second day.[Illustration: CORNISH FISH.]DAY THE THIRD


"And a beautiful day it is, ladies, though it won't do for Kynance."Only 8 a.m., yet there stood the faithful Charles, hat in hand, having
heard that his ladies were at breakfast, and being evidently anxious
that they should not lose an hour of him and his carriage, which were
both due at Falmouth to-night.For this day was Saturday, and we were
sending him home for Sunday."As I found out last night, the tide won't suit for Kynance till
Wednesday or Thursday, and you'll be too tired to walk much to-day.Suppose I were to drive you to Kennack
Sands, back by the serpentine works to Cadgwith, and home to dinner?Then after dinner I'll give the horse a rest for two hours, and take
you to Mullion; we can order tea at Mary Mundy's, and go on to the cove
as far as I can get with the carriage.I'll leave it at the farm and be
in time to help you over the rocks to see the caves, run ahead and meet
you again with the carriage, and drive you back to Mary Mundy's.You
can have tea and be home in the moonlight before nine o'clock."we asked, a good deal bewildered by this carefully-outlined
plan and all the strange names of places and people, yet not a little
touched by the kindly way in which we were "taken in and done for" by
our faithful squire of dames.Oh, after an hour or two's rest the horse can start
again--say at midnight, and be home by daylight.Or we could go to bed
and be up early at four, and still get to Falmouth by eight, in time
for the church work.Don't you trouble about us, we'll manage.He" (the
other and four-footed half of the "we") "is a capital animal, and he'd
get much harder work than this if he was at home."So we decided to put ourselves entirely in the hands of Charles,
who seemed to have our interest so much at heart, and yet evinced a
tenderness over his horse that is not too common among hired drivers.We promised to be ready in half an hour, so as to waste nothing of this
lovely day, in which we had determined to enjoy ourselves.It was delightful to wake up early and refreshed,
and come down to this sunshiny, cheerful breakfast-table, where, though
nothing was grand, all was thoroughly comfortable."I'm sure you're very kind, ladies, to be so pleased with everything,"
apologised our bright-looking handmaiden; "and since you really wish
to keep this room"--a very homely parlour which we had chosen in
preference to a larger one, because it looked on the sea--"I only wish
things was better for you; still, if you can make shift--"

Well, if travellers cannot "make shift" with perfectly clean tidy
rooms, well-cooked plain food, and more than civil, actually kindly,
attendance, they ought to be ashamed of themselves!So we declared we
would settle down in the evidently despised little parlour.The wall-paper and carpet
would have driven Morris and Co.nearly frantic; the furniture--mere
chairs and a table--belonged "to the year one"--but (better than many
modern chairs and tables) you could sit down upon the first and dine
upon the second, in safety.There was no sofa, so we gladly accepted
an offered easy-chair, and felt that all really useful things were now
ours.There was a paper arrangement in the grate, and
certain vases on the chimney-piece which literally made our hair stand
on end!After a private consultation as to how far we might venture,
without wounding the feelings of our landlady, we mildly suggested that
"perhaps we could do without these ornaments."All we wanted in their
stead were a few jars, salt-jars or jam-pots, in which to arrange our
wild flowers, of which yesterday the girls had gathered a quantity.The exchange was accepted, though with some surprise.But when, half
an hour afterwards, the parlour appeared quite transformed, decorated
in every available corner with brilliant autumn flowers--principally
yellow--intermixed with the lovely Cornish heath; when, on some excuse
or other, the hideous "ornament for your fire-stoves" was abolished,
and the grate filled with a mass of green fern and grey sea-holly--I
know no combination more exquisite both as to colour and form--then we
felt that we could survive, at least for a week, even if shut up within
this humble room, innocent of the smallest attraction as regarded art,
music, or literature.Literally swimming in sunshine, from the sparkling
sea in the distance, to the beds of marigolds close by--huge marigolds,
double and single, mingled with carnations that filled the air with
rich autumnal scent, all the more delicious because we feel it is
autumnal, and therefore cannot last.It was a very simple garden,
merely a square grass-plot with a walk and a border round it, and its
only flowers were these marigolds, carnations, with quantities of
mignonette, and bounded all round with a hedge of tamarisk; yet I think
we shall always remember it as if it were the Garden of Armida--without
a Tancred to spoil it!For--under the rose--one of the pleasures of our tour was that it was
so exclusively feminine.We could feed as we liked, dress as we liked,
talk to whom we liked, without any restriction, from the universal
masculine sense of dignity and decorum in travelling.We felt ourselves
unconventional, incognito, able to do exactly as we chose, provided we
did nothing wrong.So off we drove through Lizard Town into the "wide, wide world;" and
I repeat, what a world it was!Full filled with sunlight, and with an
atmosphere so fresh and bracing, yet so dry and mild and balmy, that
every breath was a pleasure to draw.We had felt nothing like it since
we stood on the top of the highest peak in the Island of Capri, looking
down on the blue Mediterranean.But this sea was equally blue, the sky
equally clear, yet it was home--dear old England, so often misprized.Yet, I believe, when one does get really fine English weather, there is
nothing like it in the whole world.The region we traversed was not picturesque--neither mountains, nor
glens, nor rivers, nor woods; all was level and bare, for the road lay
mostly inland, until we came out upon Kennack Sands.They might have been the very "yellow sands" where Shakespeare's elves
were bidden to "take hands" and "foot it featly here and there."You
might almost have searched for the sea-maids' footsteps along the
smooth surface where the long Atlantic waves crept harmlessly in,
making a glittering curve, and falling with a gentle "thud"--the only
sound in the solitary bay, until all at once we caught voices and
laughter, and from among some rock, emerged a party of girls.They had evidently come in a cart, which took up its station beside
our carriage, laden with bundles which looked uncommonly like bathing
gowns; and were now seeking a convenient dressing-room--one of
those rock-parlours, roofed with serpentine and floored with silver
sand--which are the sole bathing establishments here.All along the Cornish coast the bathing is delightful--when you can
get it; but sometimes for miles and miles the cliffs rise in a huge
impregnable wall, without a single break.Then perhaps there comes a
sudden cleft in the rock, a green descent, possibly with a rivulet
trickling through it, and leading to a sheltered cove or a sea-cave,
accessible only at low water, but one of the most delicious little
nooks that could be imagined.Kynance, we were told, with its "kitchen"
and "drawing-room," was the most perfect specimen of the kind; but
Kennack was sufficiently lovely.With all sorts of fun, shouting, and
laughter, the girls disappeared to their evidently familiar haunts, to
reappear as merry mermaids playing about in a crystalline sea.A most tantalising sight to my two, who vowed never again to attempt
a day's excursion without taking bathing dresses, towels, and the
inevitable fish-line, to be tied round the waist,--with a mother
holding the other end.For we had been warned against these long and
strong Atlantic waves, the recoil of which takes you off your feet even
in calm weather.As bathing must generally be done at low water, to
ensure a sandy floor and a comfortable cave, it is easy enough to be
swept out of one's depth; and the cleverest swimmer, if tossed about
among these innumerable rocks circled round by eddies of boiling white
water, would have small chance of returning with whole bones, or of
returning at all.Indeed, along this Cornish coast, life and death seem very near
together.Every pleasure carries with it a certain amount of risk; the
utmost caution is required both on land and sea, and I cannot advise
either rash or nervous people to go travelling in Cornwall.Bathing being impracticable, we consoled ourselves with ascending the
sandy hillock, which bounded one side of the bay, and sat looking from
it towards the coast-line eastwards.What a strange peace there is in a solitary shore, an empty sea, for
the one or two white dots of silent ships seemed rather to add to than
diminish its loneliness--lonelier in sunshine, I think, than even in
storm.The latter gives a sense of human life, of struggle and of
pain; while the former is all repose, the bright but solemn repose of
infinity or eternity.But these thoughts were for older heads; the only idea of the young
heads--uncommonly steady they must have been!--was of scrambling
into the most inaccessible places, and getting as near to the sea as
possible without actually tumbling into it.After a while the land
attracted them in turn, and they came back with their hands full of
flowers, some known, some unknown; great bunches of honeysuckle,
curious sand-plants, and cliff-plants; also water-plants, which fringed
a little rivulet that ran into the bay, while, growing everywhere
abundantly, was the lovely grey-green cringo, or sea-holly.All these treasures, to make the parlour pretty, required much
ingenuity to carry home safely, the sun withered them so fast.We could willingly have stayed here all day--how natural is that wish
of poor young Shelley, that in every pretty place he saw he might
remain "for ever"!--but the forenoon was passing, and we had much to
see."Poltesco, everybody goes to Poltesco," observed the patient Charles.At Poltesco are the principal
serpentine works--the one commerce of the district.The monotonous hum
of its machinery mingled oddly with the murmur of a trout-stream which
ran through the pretty little valley, crossed by a wooden bridge, where
a solitary angler stood fishing in imperturbable content.There were only about a dozen workmen visible; one of whom came
forward and explained to us the mode of work, afterwards taking us
to the show-room, which contained everything possible to be made of
serpentine, from mantelpieces and tombstones, down to brooches and
studs.Very delicate and beautiful was the workmanship; the forms of
some of the things--vases and candlesticks especially--were quite
Pompeian.In truth, throughout Cornwall, we often came upon shapes,
Roman or Greek, proving how even yet relics of its early masters or
colonisers linger in this western corner of England.When, as we passed, more than one busy
workman lifted up his head for a moment, we noticed faces almost
classic in type, quite different from the bovine, agricultural
Hodge of the midland counties.There was neither stupidity nor servility, but a sort of dignified
independence.No pressing to buy, no looking out for gratuities,
only a kindly politeness, which did not fail even when we departed,
taking only a few little ornaments.We should have liked to carry off
a cart-load--especially two enormous vases and a chimney-piece--but
travellers have limits to luggage, and purse as well.we left it with regret, but we were in the hands
of the ever-watchful Charles, anxious that we should see as much as
possible."The driving-road goes far inland, but there's a splendid cliff-walk
from Poltesco to Cadgwith direct.The young ladies might do it with a
guide--here he is, a man I know, quite reliable.They'll walk it easily
in half an hour.But you, ma'am, I think you'd better come with me."So I put my "chickens" in safe charge, meekly
re-entered the carriage, and drove, humbly and alone, across a flat
dull country, diversified here and there by a few cottages, politely
called a village--the two villages of Ruan Minor and Ruan Major.I
afterwards found that they were not without antiquarian interest, that
I might have gone to examine a curious old church, well, and oratory,
supposed to have been inhabited by St.But we had left the
guide-book at home, with the so longed-for bathing gowns, and Charles
was not of archaeological mind, so I heard nothing and investigated
nothing.Except, indeed, numerous huge hand-bills, posted on barn doors and
gates, informing the inhabitants that an Exhibition of Fine Arts,
admittance one shilling, was on view close by.Charles was most anxious
I should stop and visit it, saying it was "very fine."But as within
the last twelvemonth I had seen the Royal Academy, Grosvenor Gallery,
and most of the galleries and museums in Italy, the Fine Art Exhibition
of Ruan Minor was not overwhelmingly attractive.However, not to wound
the good Cornishman, who was evidently proud of it, I explained that,
on the whole, I preferred nature to art.And how grand nature was in this fishing-village of Cadgwith, to which
after a long round, we came at last![Illustration: CADGWITH COVE.]Nestled snugly in a bend of the coast which shelters it from north
and east, leaving it open to southern sunshine, while another curve
of land protects it from the dense fogs which are so common at the
Lizard, Cadgwith is, summer and winter, one of the pleasantest nooks
imaginable.The climate, Charles told me, is so mild, that invalids
often settle down in the one inn--a mere village inn externally, but
very comfortable.And, as I afterwards heard at Lizard Town, the parson
and his wife--"didn't I know them?"and I felt myself rather looked
down upon because I did not know them--are the kindest of people,
who take pleasure in looking after the invalids, rich or poor."Yes,"
Charles considered Cadgwith was a nice place to winter in, "only just a
trifle dull."Probably so, to judge by the interest which, even in this
tourist-season, our carriage excited, as we wound down one side and
up another of the ravine in which the village is built, with a small
fishing-station at the bottom, rather painfully odoriferous.The
fisher-wives came to their doors, the old fisher-men stood, hands in
pockets, the roly-poly healthy fisher-children stopped playing, to
turn round and stare.In these parts everybody stares at everybody,
and generally everybody speaks to everybody--a civil "good-day" at any
rate, sometimes more."This is a heavy pull for you," said a sympathetic old woman, who had
watched me leave the carriage and begin mounting the cliff towards the
Devil's Frying-pan--the principal thing to be seen at Cadgwith.She
followed me, and triumphantly passed me, though she had to carry a bag
of potatoes on her back.I wondered if her feeling was pity or envy
towards another old person who had to carry nothing but her own self.She and I sat down together on the hill-side and had a chat, while I
waited for the two little black dots which I could see moving round the
opposite headland.She gave me all kinds of information, in the simple
way peculiar to country folk, whose innocent horizon comprises the
whole world, which, may be, is less pleasant than the little world of
Cadgwith.The Devil's Frying-pan is a wonderful sight.Imagine a natural
amphitheatre two acres in extent, inclosed by a semi-circular <DW72>
about two hundred feet high, covered with grass and flowers and low
bushes.Outside, the wide, open sea, which pours in to the shingly
beach at the bottom through an arch of serpentine, the colouring of
which, and of the other rocks surrounding it, is most exquisite,
varying from red to green, with sometimes a tint of grey.Were Cadgwith
a little nearer civilisation, what a show-place it would become!The tiny farm-house on the
hill-side near the Frying-pan looked, within and without, much as it
must have looked for the last hundred years; and the ragged, unkempt,
tongue-tied little girl, from whom we succeeded in getting a drink
of milk in a tumbler which she took five minutes to search for, had
certainly never been to a Board School.She investigated the penny
which we deposited as if it were a great natural curiosity rarely
attainable, and she gazed after us as we climbed the stile leading to
the Frying-pan as if wondering what on earth could tempt respectable
people, who had nothing to do, into such a very uncomfortable place.[Illustration: THE DEVIL'S FRYING PAN, NEAR CADGWITH.]Uncomfortable, certainly, as we sat with our feet stuck in the long
grass to prevent slipping down the <DW72>--a misadventure which would
have been, to say the least, awkward.Those boiling waves, roaring each
after each through the arch below; and those jagged rocks, round which
innumerable sea-birds were flying--one could quite imagine that were
any luckless vessel to find itself in or near the Frying-pan, it would
never get out again.To meditative minds there is something very startling in the perpetual
contrast between the summer tourist-life, so cheerful and careless,
and the winter life of the people here, which must be so full of
privations; for one half the year there is nothing to do, no market
for serpentine, and almost no fishing possible: they have to live
throughout the dark days upon the hay made while the sun shines."No, no," said one of the Lizard folk, whom I asked if there was much
drunkenness thereabout, for I had seen absolutely none; "no, us don't
drink; us can't afford it.Winter's a bad time for we--sometimes for
four months a man doesn't earn a halfpenny.He has to save in summer,
or he'd starve the rest of the year."I have seldom seen,
in any part of England or Scotland, such an honest, independent,
respectable race as the working people on this coast, and indeed
throughout Cornwall.We left with regret the pretty village, resolving to come back again
in a day or two; it was barely three miles from the Lizard, though the
difference in climate was said to be so great.And then we drove back
across the bleak down and through the keen "hungry" sea-air, which made
dinner a matter of welcome importance.And without dwelling too much
on the delights of the flesh--very mild delights after all--I will say
that the vegetables grown in the garden, and the grapes in the simple
green-house beside it, were a credit to Cornwall, especially so near
the sea-coast.We had just time to dine, repose a little, and communicate our address
to our affectionate friends at home--so as to link ourselves for a few
brief days with the outside world--when appeared the punctual Charles."Don't be afraid, ladies, he's had a good rest,"--this was the
important animal about whose well-being we were naturally anxious.Charles patted his shoulder, and a little person much given to deep
equine affections tenderly stroked his nose.He seemed sensible of the
attention and of what was expected from him, and started off, as lively
as if he had been idle for a week, across the Lizard Down and Pradenack
Down to Mullion."I hope Mary will be at home," said Charles, turning round as usual to
converse; "she'll be sure to make you comfortable.Of course you've
heard of Mary Mundy?"There was in one of our guide-books a most
glowing description of the Old Inn, and also an extract from a poem,
apostrophising the charms of Mary Mundy.When we said we knew the
enthusiastic Scotch Professor who had written it, we felt that we rose
a step in the estimation of Charles."And Mary will be so pleased to see anybody who knows the
gentleman"--in Cornwall the noted Greek Professor was merely "the
gentleman.""She's got his poem in her visitors' book and his portrait
in her album.When we reached Mullion and drove up to the
door of the Old Inn, there darted out to meet us, not Mary, but an
individual concerning whom Fame has been unjustly silent."It's only Mary's brother," said Charles, with an accent of deep
disappointment.But as the honest man who had apparently gone through life as "Mary's
brother" stood patting our horse and talking to our driver, with both
of whom he seemed on terms of equal intimacy, his welcome to ourselves
was such a mixture of cordiality and despair that we could scarcely
keep from laughing."Mary's gone to Helstone, ladies; her would have been delighted, but
her's gone marketing to Helstone.I hope her'll be back soon, for I
doesn't know what to do without she.The house is full, and there's a
party of eleven come to tea, and actually wanting it sent down to them
at the Cove.And you shall get your tea,
ladies, even if they have to go without."We expressed our gratitude, and left Charles to arrange all for us,
which he did in the most practical way."And you think Mary may be back at six?""Her said her would, and I hope her will," answered the brother
despondently."Her's very seldom out; us can't get on at all without
she."This, and several more long and voluble speeches given in broad
Cornish, with the true Cornish confusion of pronouns, and with an air
of piteous perplexity--nay, abject helplessness, the usual helplessness
of man without woman--proved too much for our risible nerves.We
maintained a decorous gravity till we had driven away, and then fell
into shouts of laughter--the innocent laughter of happy-minded people
over the smallest joke or the mildest species of fun."Never mind, ladies, you'll get your tea all right.If Mary said she'd
be back at six, back she'll be.And you'll find a capital tea waiting
for you; there isn't a more comfortable inn in all Cornwall."Which, we afterwards found, was saying a great deal.Mullion Cove is a good mile from Mullion village, and as we jolted over
the rough road I was remorseful over both carriage and horse."Not at all, ma'am, he's used to it.Often and often he comes here with
pic-nic parties, all the way from Falmouth.I'll put him in at the
farm, and be down with you at the Cove directly.You'll find the rocks
pretty bad walking, but there's a cave which you ought to see.There was no resisting the way the kindly young Cornishman thus
identified himself with our interests, and gave himself all sorts
of extra trouble on our account.And when after a steep and not too
savoury descent--the cove being used as a fish cellar--we found
ourselves on the beach, shut in by those grand rocks of serpentine,
with Mullion Island lying ahead about a quarter of a mile off, we felt
we had not come here for nothing.The great feature of Mullion Cove is its sea-caves, of which there are
two, one on the beach, the other round the point, and only accessible
at low water.Now, we saw the tide was rising fast."They'll have to wade; I told them they would have to wade!"cried an
anxious voice behind me; and "I was ware," as ancient chroniclers say,
of the presence of another "old hen," the same whom we had noticed
conducting her brood of chickens, or ducklings--they seemed more like
the latter now--to bathe on Kennack Sands."Yes, they have been away more than half an hour, all my children
except this one"--a small boy who looked as if he wished he had gone
too."They would go, though I warned them they would have to wade.And
there they are, just going into the cave.One, two, three, four, five,
six," counting the black specks that were seen moving on, or rather in,
the water."Oh dear, they've _all_ gone in![Illustration: MULLION COVE, CORNWALL.]Nevertheless, in the midst of her distress, the benevolent lady stopped
to give me a helping hand into the near cave, a long, dark passage,
with light at either end.My girls had already safely threaded it and
come triumphantly out at the other side.But what with the darkness and
the uncertain footing over what felt like beds of damp seaweed, with
occasional stones, through which one had to grope every inch of one's
way, my heart rather misgave me, until I was cheered by the apparition
of the faithful Charles."Don't go back, ma'am, you'll be so sorry afterwards.I'll strike a
light and help you.Slow and steady, you'll come to no harm.And it's
beautiful when you get out at the other end."The most exquisite little nook; where you could have
imagined a mermaid came daily to comb her hair; one can easily believe
in mermaids or anything else in Cornwall.What a charming dressing-room
she would have, shut in on three sides by those great walls of
serpentine, and in front the glittering sea, rolling in upon a floor of
the loveliest silver sand.But the only mermaid there was an artist's wife, standing beside her
husband's easel, at which he was painting away so earnestly that he
scarcely noticed us.Very picturesque he looked, and she too, in her
rough serge dress, with her pretty bare feet and ankles, the shoes and
stockings lying in a corner as if they had not been worn for hours.they were quite unnecessary on those soft sands,
and their owner stood and talked with me as composedly as if it were
the height of the fashion to go barefoot.And far more than anything
concerning herself, she seemed interested in my evident interest in the
picture, which promised to be a remarkably good one, and which, if I
see it on the R. A. walls next year will furnish my only clue to the
identity of the couple, or theirs to mine.But the tide was fast advancing; they began to take down the easel, and
I remembered that the narrow winding cave was our only way out from
this rock-inclosed fairy paradise to the prosaic beach."Look, they are wading ashore up to the knees!And we shall have to
wade too if we don't make haste back."So cried the perplexed mother of the six too-adventurous ducklings.But mine, more considerate, answered me from the rocks where they were
scrambling, and helped me back through the cave into safe quarters,
where we stood watching the waders with mingled excitement and--envy?I can still recall the delicious sensation of paddling across the
smooth sea-sand, and of walking up the bed of a Highland burn.the change twixt Now and Then," I sat calmly on a stone, dry-shod; as
was best.Still, is it not a benign law of nature, that the things we
are no longer able to do, we almost cease to wish to do?Perhaps even
the last cessation of all things will come naturally at the end, as
naturally as we turn round and go to sleep at night?I am proud to think how high and steep was
the cliff we re-ascended, all three of us, and from which we stood
and looked at sky and sea.Such a sea and such a sky: amber clear, so
that one could trace the whole line of coast--Mount's Bay, with St.Michael's Mount dotted in the midst of it, and even the Land's End,
beyond which the sun, round and red, was just touching the top of the
waves.We should have liked to watch him drop below them--that splendid
sea-sunset of which one never tires, but we had some distance to walk,
and we began to rejoice in the prospect of Mary Mundy's tea."I'll go on ahead and have the carriage ready," said the ever
thoughtful Charles."You can't miss your way, ladies.Just follow the
hedges"--that tempting aerial promenade, to which we were now getting
accustomed, becoming veritable Blondins in petticoats--"then cross the
cornfield; and take to the hedges again.You'll be at the farm-yard
directly."Not quite--for we lingered, tempted by the abundance of corn-flowers,
of which we gathered, not handfuls but armfuls.When we reached
it, what a picture of an English farm-yard it was!With a regular
old-fashioned English milk-maid--such as Izaak Walton would have loved
to describe--sitting amidst her shining pails, her cows standing round
her, meekly waiting their turn.Sleek, calm creatures they were,
Juno-eyed and soft-skinned--of that peculiar shade of grey which I
have seen only in Cornwall.And, being rather a connoisseur in cows,
I have often amused myself to notice how the kine of each country
have their own predominant colour, which seems to harmonise with its
special landscape.The curious yellow tint of Highland cattle, the red,
white, or brown of those of the midland counties, and the delicate
grey of Cornish cows, alike suit the scene around them, and belong to
it as completely as the dainty little Swiss herds do to their Alpine
pastures, or the large, mild, cream- oxen to the Campagna at
Rome.But we had to tear ourselves away from this Arcadia, for in the midst
of the farm-yard appeared the carriage and Charles.So we jolted
back--it seemed as if Cornish carriages and horses could go anywhere
and over everything--to the Old Inn and Mary Mundy.She _had_ come home, and everything was right.As we soon found,
everything and everybody was accustomed to be put to rights by Miss
Mary Mundy.She stood at the door to greet us--a bright, brown-faced little
woman with the reddest of cheeks and the blackest of eyes; I have no
hesitation in painting her portrait here, as she is, so to speak,
public property, known and respected far and wide.[Illustration: A CRABBER'S HOLE, GERRAN'S BAY.]"Delighted to see you, ladies; delighted to see any friends of the
Professor's; and I hope you enjoyed the Cove, and that you're all
hungry, and will find your tea to your liking.It's the best we can do;
we're very homely folk here, but we try to make people comfortable,"
and so on and so on, a regular stream of chatty conversation, given in
the strongest Cornish, with the kindliest of Cornish hearts, as she
ushered us into a neat little parlour at the back of the inn.There lay spread, not one of your dainty afternoon teas, with two or
three wafery slices of bread and butter, but a regular substantial
meal.Cheerful candles--of course in serpentine candlesticks--were
already lit, and showed us the bright teapot full of that welcome drink
to weary travellers, hot, strong and harmless; the gigantic home-baked
loaf, which it seemed sacrilegious to have turned into toast; the rich,
yellow butter--I am sure those lovely cows had something to do with
it, and also with the cream, so thick that the spoon could almost have
stood upright in it.Besides, there was a quantity of that delicious
clotted cream, which here accompanies every meal and of which I had
vainly tried to get the receipt, but was answered with polite scorn,
"Oh, ma'am, it would be of no use to _you_: Cornish cream can only be
made from Cornish cows!"Whether this remarkable fact in natural history be true or not, let me
record the perfection of Mary Mundy's cream, which, together with her
jam and her marmalade, was a refection worthy of the gods.She pressed us again and again to "have some more," and her charge for
our magnificent meal was as small as her gratitude was great for the
slight addition we made to it."No, I'll not say no, ma'am, it'll come in handy; us has got a young
niece to bring up--my brother and me--please'm.Yes, I'm glad you came,
and I hope you'll come again, please'm.And if you see the Professor,
you'll tell him he's not forgotten, please'm."This garniture of "please'm" at the end of every sentence reminded
us of the Venetian "probbedirla," _per ubbedirla_, with which our
gondolier Giovanna used to amuse us, often dragging it in in the oddest
way."Yes, the Signora will get a beautiful day, probbedirla," or "My
wife has just lost her baby, probbedirla."Mary Mundy's "please'm"
often came in with equal incongruity, and her voluble tongue ran on
nineteen to the dozen; but her talk was so shrewd and her looks so
pleasant--once, no doubt, actually pretty, and still comely enough for
a middle-aged woman--that we departed, fully agreeing with her admiring
Professor that

  "The brightest thing on Cornish land
  Is the face of Miss Mary Mundy."Recrossing Pradenack down in the dim light of a newly-risen moon,
everything looked so solitary and ghostly that we started to see moving
from behind a furz-bush, a mysterious figure, which crossed the road
slowly, and stood waiting for us.Was it man or ghost, or--

Only a donkey!It might have been Tregeagle
himself--Tregeagle, the grim mad-demon of Cornish tradition, once a
dishonest steward, who sold his soul to the devil, and is doomed to
keep on emptying Dozmare Pool, near St.Neots (the same mere wherein
Excalibur was thrown), with a limpet-shell; and to spend his nights in
other secluded places balancing interminable accounts, which are always
just sixpence wrong.I fear some of us, weak in arithmetic, had a secret
sympathy for him!But we never met him--nor anything worse than that
spectral donkey, looming large and placid against the level horizon.Soon, "the stars came out by twos and threes,"--promising a fine night
and finer morning, during which, while we were comfortably asleep,
our good horse and man would be driving across this lonely region to
Falmouth, in time to take the good people to church on Sunday morning."And we'll do it, too--don't you be anxious about us, ladies," insisted
Charles."I'll feed him well, and groom him well.I likes to take care
of a good horse, and you'll see, he'll take no harm.I'll be back when
you want me, at the week's end, or perhaps before then, with some party
or other--we're always coming to the Lizard--and I'll just look in and
see how you're getting on, and how you liked Kynance.We thanked our kindly charioteer, bade him and his horse good-bye,
wished him a pleasant journey through the moonlight, which was every
minute growing more beautiful, then went indoors to supper--no!supper
would have been an insult to Mary Mundy's tea--to bed.DAY THE FOURTH


Sunday, September 4th--and we had started on September 1st; was it
possible we had only been travelling four days?We had seen so much, taken in so many
new interests--nay, made several new friends.Already we began to plan
another meeting with John Curgenven, who we found was a relation of
our landlady, or of our bright-faced serving maiden, Esther--I forget
which.But everybody seemed connected with everybody at the Lizard,
and everybody took a friendly interest in everybody.The arrival of
new lodgers in the "genteel" parlour which we had not appreciated
was important information, and we were glad to hear that Charles had
started about four in the morning quite cheery.And what a morning it was!--a typical Sabbath, a day of rest, a day
to rejoice in.Strolling round the garden at eight o'clock, while the
dew still lay thick on the grass, and glittered like diamonds on the
autumnal spider-webs, even the flowers seemed to know it was Sunday,
the mignonette bed to smell sweeter, the marigolds--yes!aesthetic
fashion is right in its love for marigolds--burnt in a perfect blaze
of golden colour and aromatic scent.The air was so mild that we could
imagine summer was still with us: and the great wide circle of sea
gleamed in the sunshine as if there never had been, never could be,
such a thing as cloud or storm.Having ascertained that there was no service nearer than Grade, some
miles off, until the afternoon, we "went to church" on the cliffs, in
Pistol Meadow, beside the green mounds where the two hundred drowned
sailors sleep in peace.[Illustration: STEAM SEINE BOATS GOING OUT.]Absolutely solitary: not a living creature,
not even a sheep came near me the whole morning:--and in the silence
I could hear almost every word said by my young folks, searching for
sea-treasures among the rocks and little pools far below.Westwards
towards Kynance, and eastwards towards Landewednack--the church we were
to go to in the afternoon--the cliff path was smooth and green, the
short grass full of those curious dainty flowers, some of which were
new to our eager eyes.At other times the road was so precipitous that
we did not wonder at those carefully white-washed stones every few
yards, which are the sole guide to the coastguard men of dark nights.Even in daylight, if the wind were high, or the footing slippery with
rain, the cliff-walk from the Lizard to Kynance would be no joke to
uninitiated feet.Now, all was so still that the wind never once fluttered the letter I
was writing, and so warm that we were glad to escape the white glare of
the wall of the Lizard Lights and sit in a cool hollow, watching sky
and ocean, with now and then a sea-bird floating lazily between, a dark
speck on the perpetual blue."If it will only keep like this all week!"And, as we sat, we planned
out each day, so as to miss nothing, and lose nothing--either of time
or strength: doing enough, but never too much--as is often the fatal
mistake of tourists.And then, following the grand law of travelling,
to have one's "meals reg'lar"--we went indoors and dined.Afterwards in
honour of the day

        "that comes between
  The Saturday and Monday,"

we dressed ourselves in all our best--very humble best it was!--to join
the good people going to church at Landewednack.This, which in ancient Cornish means "the white-roofed church of St.Wednack"--hagiologists must decide who that individual was!--is the
name of the parish to which the comparatively modern Lizard Town
belongs.The church is in a very picturesque corner, close to the sea,
though both it and the rectory are protected by a sudden dip in the
ground, so that you see neither till you are close upon them.A fine
Norman doorway, a curious hagioscope, and other points, interesting to
archaeologists--also the neatest and prettiest of churchyards--make
note-worthy this, the most southerly church in England.A fine old
building, not spoiled though "restored."The modern open pews, and a
modern memorial pulpit of serpentine, jarred less than might have been
expected with the carefully-preserved remains of the past.In Landewednack church is said to have been preached the last sermon in
Cornish.Since, the ancient tongue has completely
died out, and the people of King Arthur's country have become wholly
English.Still, they are not the English of the midland and northern districts,
but of a very different type and race.I have heard it said that a
seaboard population, accustomed to wrestle with the dangers of the
coast, to move about from place to place, see foreign countries, and
carry on its business in the deep waters, is always more capable, more
intelligent, as a whole, than an inland people, whether agricultural
or manufacturing.It may be so: but certainly the aborigines of
Lizard Town, who could easily be distinguished from the visitors--of
whom there was yet a tolerable sprinkling--made a very interesting
congregation; orderly, respectable, reverent; simple in dress and
manner, yet many of them, both the men and women, exceedingly
picturesque.That is, the old men and the old women: the younger ones
aped modern fashion even here, in this out-of-the-way corner, and
consequently did not look half so well as their seniors.I must name one more member of the congregation--a large black dog,
who walked in and settled himself in the pew behind, where he behaved
during half the service in an exemplary manner, worthy of the Highland
shepherds' dogs, who always come to church with their masters, and
conduct themselves with equal decorum.There is always a certain pathos in going in to worship in a strange
church, with a strange congregation, of whom you are as ignorant as
they of you.In the intervals of kneeling with them as "miserable
sinners," one finds oneself speculating upon them, their possible
faults and virtues, joys and sorrows, hopes and fears, watching the
unknown faces, and trying to read thereon the records of a common
humanity.A silent homily, better perhaps than most sermons.Not that there was aught to complain of in the sermon, and the singing
was especially good.Many a London choir might have taken a lesson from
this village church at the far end of Cornwall.When service was over,
we lingered in the pretty and carefully tended churchyard, where the
evening light fell softly upon many curious gravestones, of seafaring
men, and a few of wrecked sailors--only a few, since it is but within
a generation that bodies washed ashore from the deep were allowed to
be buried in consecrated ground; most of them, like the two hundred in
Pistol Meadow, being interred as near as convenient to where they were
found, without any burial rites.Still, in all the churchyards along
this coast are graves with a story.A little corner railed off has an
old and sad one.There lie buried the victims of the plague, which in
1645 devastated the village.No one since has ever ventured to disturb
their resting-place.Very green and peaceful the churchyard looked: the beautiful day was
dying, beautiful to the last.We stood and watched the congregation
melt slowly away, disappearing down the lane, and then, attracted by
the sound of music, we re-entered the church.There we sat and listened
for another half-hour to the practising of an anthem ready for the
harvest festival, which had been announced for the following Tuesday;
exceedingly well done too, the rector's voice leading it all, with an
energy and enthusiasm that at once accounted for the capital condition
of the choir.was our earnest sigh as we walked
home; and anxious not to lose a minute of it, we gave ourselves the
briefest rest, and turned out again, I to watch the sunset from the
cliffs, while the others descended once more to their beloved sea-pools."Such anemones, such sea-weed!Besides,
sunsets are all alike," added the youthful, practical, and slightly
unpoetical mind.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.Every one has a mysterious charm of its
own--just like that in every new human face.I have seen hundreds of
sunsets in my time, and those I shall see are narrowing down now, but
I think to the end of my life I shall always feel a day incomplete of
which I did not see the sunset.The usual place where the sun dropped into the
sea, just beyond the point of the Land's End, was all a golden mist.I hastened west, climbing one intervening cliff after the other,
anxious not to miss the clear sight of him as he set his glowing
feet, or rather his great round disc, on the sea.At last I found a
"comfortable" stone, sheltered from the wind, which blew tolerably
fresh, and utterly solitary (as I thought), the intense silence
being such that one could almost hear the cropping of three placid
sheep--evidently well accustomed to sunsets, and thinking them of
little consequence.There I sat until the last red spark had gone out, quenched in the
Atlantic waters, and from behind the vanished sun sprung a gleam of
absolutely green light, "like a firework out of a rocket," the young
people said; such as I had never seen before, though we saw it once
afterwards.Nature's fireworks they were; and I could see even the two
little black figures moving along the rocks below stand still to watch
them.I watched too, with that sort of lonely delight--the one shadow
upon it being that it is so lonely--with which all one's life one is
accustomed to watch beautiful and vanishing things.Then seeing how
fast the colours were fading and the sky darkening, I rose; but just
took a step or two farther to look over the edge of my stone into the
next dip of the cliff, and there I saw--

[Illustration: HAULING IN THE BOATS--EVENING.]Nothing else would have
sat so long and so silently, for I had been within three yards of them
all the time, and had never discovered them, nor they me.They sat, quite absorbed in
one another, hand in hand, looking quietly seaward, their faces bathed
in the rosy sunset--which to them was a sunrise, the sort of sun which
never rises twice in a life-time.Evidently they did not see me, in fact I just
peered over the rock's edge and drew back again; any slight sound they
probably attributed to the harmless sheep.Well, it was but an equally
harmless old woman, who did not laugh at them, as some might have done,
but smiled and wished them well, as she left them to their sunset, and
turned to face the darkening east, where the sun would rise to-morrow.The moon was rising there now, and it was a picture to behold.Indeed,
all these Cornish days seemed so full of moonrises and sunsets--and
sunrises too--that it was really inconvenient.Going to bed seemed
almost a sin--as on this night, when, opening our parlour door, which
looked right on to the garden, we saw the whole world lying in a flood
of moonlight peace, the marigolds and carnations leaning cheek to
cheek, as motionless as the two young lovers on the cliff.must long ago have had their dream broken, for five minutes afterwards
I had met a most respectable fat couple from Lizard Town taking their
Sunday evening stroll, in all their Sunday best, along those very
cliffs.But perhaps, the good folks had once
been lovers too.How the stars
shone, without a mist or a cloud; how the Lizard Lights gleamed, even
in spite of the moonlight, and how clear showed the black outline of
Kynance Cove, from which came through the silence a dull murmur of
waves!It was, as we declared, a sin and a shame to go to bed at all
though we had been out the whole day, and hoped to be out the whole of
to-morrow.Still, human nature could not keep awake for ever.We passed
from the poetical to the practical, and decided to lay us down and
sleep.But, in the middle of the night I woke, rose, and looked out of the
window.Sea and sky were one blackness, literally as "black as
ink," and melting into one another so that both were undistinguishable.As for the moon and stars--heaven knows where they had gone to, for
they seemed utterly blotted out.The only light visible was the ghostly
gleam of those two great eyes, the Lizard Lights, stretching far out
into the intense darkness.I never saw such darkness--unbroken even by
the white crest of a wave.And the stillness was like the stillness of
death, with a heavy weight in the air which made me involuntarily go
to sleep again, though with an awed impression of "something going to
happen."And sure enough in another hour something did happen.I started awake,
feeling as if a volley of artillery had been poured in at my window.It was the wildest deluge of rain, beating against the panes, and with
it came a wind that howled and shrieked round the house as if all the
demons in Cornwall, Tregeagle himself included, were let loose at once.Now we understood what a Lizard storm could be.I have seen
Mediterranean storms, sweeping across the Campagna like armed
battalions of avenging angels, pouring out their vials of wrath--rain,
hail, thunder, and lightning--unceasingly for two whole days.I have
been in Highland storms, so furious that one had to sit down in the
middle of the road with one's plaid over one's head, till the worst of
their rage was spent.But I never saw or heard anything more awful than
this Lizard storm, to which I lay and listened till the day began to
dawn.Then the wind lulled a little, but the rain still fell in torrents,
and the sky and sea were as black as ever.The weather had evidently
broken for good--that is, for evil.the harvest, and the harvest
festival!And alas--of minor importance, but still some, to us at
least--alas for our holiday in Cornwall!It was with a heavy heart that, feeling there was not the slightest use
in getting up, I turned round and took another sleep.DAY THE FIFTH


"Hope for the best, and be prepared for the worst," had been the motto
of our journey.So when we rose to one of the wettest mornings that
ever came out of the sky, there was a certain satisfaction in being
prepared for it."We must have a fire, that is certain," was our first decision.This
entailed the abolition of our beautiful decorations--our sea-holly
and ferns; also some anxious looks from our handmaiden.Apparently no
fire, had been lit in this rather despised room for many months--years
perhaps--and the chimney rather resented being used.A few agonised
down-puffs greatly interfered with the comfort of the breakfast table,
and an insane attempt to open the windows made matters worse.Which was most preferable--to be stifled or deluged?We were just
considering the question, when the chimney took a new and kinder
thought, or the wind took a turn--it seemed to blow alternately from
every quarter, and then from all quarters at once--the smoke went up
straight, the room grew warm and bright, with the cosy peace of the
first fire of the season.Existence became once more endurable, nay,
pleasant."We shall survive, spite of the rain!"And we began to laugh over our
lost day which we had meant to begin by bathing in Housel Cove; truly,
just to stand outside the door would give an admirable douche bath in
three minutes."But how nice it is to be inside, with a roof over our
heads, and no necessity for travelling.Fancy the unfortunate tourists
who have fixed on to-day for visiting the Lizard!"(Charles had told us
that Monday was a favourite day for excursions.)"Fancy anybody being
obliged to go out such weather as this!"And in our deep pity for our fellow-creatures we forgot to pity
ourselves.Nor was there much pity needed; we had provided against emergencies,
with a good store of needlework and knitting, anything that would
pack in small compass, also a stock of unquestionably "light"
literature--paper-covered, double-columned, sixpenny volumes, inclosing
an amount of enjoyment which those only can understand who are true
lovers of Walter Scott.We had enough of him to last for a week of wet
days.And we had a one-volume Tennyson, all complete, and a "Morte
d'Arthur"--Sir Thomas Malory's.On this literary provender we felt that
as yet we should not starve.Also, some little fingers having a trifling turn for art, brought out
triumphantly a colour-box, pencils, and pictures.And the wall-paper
being one of the very ugliest that ever eye beheld, we sought and
obtained permission to adorn it with these, our _chefs-d'[oe]uvre_,
pasted at regular intervals.Where we hope they still remain, for the
edification of succeeding lodgers.We read the "Idylls of the King" all through, finishing with "The
Passing of Arthur," where the "bold Sir Bedivere" threw Excalibur into
the mere--which is supposed to be Dozmare Pool.Here King Arthur's
faithful lover was so melted--for the hundredth time--by the pathos
of the story, and by many old associations, that the younger and
more practical minds grew scornful, and declared that probably King
Arthur had never existed at all--or if he had, was nothing but a rough
barbarian, unlike even the hero of Sir Thomas Malory, and far more
unlike the noble modern gentleman of Tennyson's verse.Maybe: and yet,
seeing that

  "'Tis better to have loved and lost
  Than never to have loved at all,"

may it not be better to have believed in an impossible ideal man, than
to accept contentedly a low ideal, and worship blindly the worldly, the
mean, or the base?This topic furnished matter for so much hot argument, that, besides
doing a quantity of needlework, we succeeded in making our one wet day
by no means the least amusing of our seventeen days in Cornwall.[Illustration: HAULING IN THE LINES.]Hour after hour we watched the rain--an even down-pour.In the midst
of it we heard a rumour that Charles had been seen about the town, and
soon after he appeared at the door, hat in hand, soaked but smiling,
to inquire for and sympathise with his ladies.Yes, he _had_ brought a
party to the Lizard that day!--unfortunate souls (or bodies), for there
could not have been a dry thread left on them!We gathered closer round
our cosy fire; ate our simple dinner with keen enjoyment, and agreed
that after all we had much to be thankful for.In the afternoon the storm abated a little, and we thought we would
seize the chance of doing some shopping, if there was a shop in Lizard
Town.So we walked--I ought rather to say waded, for the road was
literally swimming--meeting not one living creature, except a family of
young ducks, who, I need scarcely say, were enjoying supreme felicity."Yes, ladies, this is the sort of weather we have pretty well all
winter.Very little frost or snow, but rain and storm, and plenty of
it.Also fogs; I've heard there's nothing anywhere like the fogs at the
Lizard."So said the woman at the post-office, which, except the serpentine
shops, seemed to be the one emporium of commerce in the place.There we
could get all we wanted, and a good deal that we were very thankful we
did not want, of eatables, drinkables, and wearables.Also ornaments,
china vases, &c., of a kind that would have driven frantic any person
of aesthetic tastes.Among them an active young Cornishman of about a
year old was meandering aimlessly, or with aims equally destructive
to himself and the community.He all but succeeded in bringing down a
row of plates upon his devoted head, and then tied himself up, one fat
finger after another, in a ball of twine, upon which he began to howl
violently."He's a regular little trial," said the young mother proudly."He's
only sixteen months old, and yet he's up to all sorts of mischief.I
don't know what in the world I shall do with he, presently."Not naughty, only active," suggested another maternal spirit, and
pleaded that the young jackanapes should be found something to do that
was not mischief, but yet would occupy his energies, and fill his mind.At which, the bright bold face looked up as if he had understood it
all--an absolutely fearless face, brimming with fun, and shrewdness
too.The "regular little trial" may grow into a valuable
member of society--fisherman, sailor, coastguardman--daring and doing
heroic deeds; perhaps saving many a life on nights such as last night,
which had taught us what Cornish coast-life was all winter through.The storm was now gradually abating; the wind had lulled entirely, the
rain had ceased, and by sunset a broad yellow streak all along the west
implied that it might possibly be a fine day to-morrow.But the lane was almost a river still, and the slippery altitudes of
the "hedges" were anything but desirable.As the only possible place
for a walk I ventured into a field where two or three cows cropped
their supper of damp grass round one of those green hillocks seen in
every Cornish pasture field--a manure heap planted with cabbages, which
grow there with a luxuriance that turns ugliness into positive beauty.Very dreary everything was--the soaking grass, the leaden sky, the
angry-looking sea, over which a rainy moon was just beginning to throw
a faint glimmer; while shorewards one could just trace the outline of
Lizard Point and the wheat-field behind it.Yesterday those fields had
looked so sunshiny and fair, but to-night they were all dull and grey,
with rows of black dots indicating the soppy, sodden harvest sheaves.Which reminded me that to-morrow was the harvest festival at
Landewednack, when all the world and his wife was invited by shilling
tickets to have tea in the rectory garden, and afterwards to assist at
the evening thanksgiving service in the church.some poor farmer might well exclaim,
especially on such a day as this.Some harvest festivals must
occasionally seem a bitter mockery.Indeed, I doubt if the next
generation will not be wise in taking our "Prayers for Rain,"
"Prayers for Fair Weather," clean out of the liturgy.Such conceited
intermeddling with the government of the world sounds to some
ridiculous, to others actually profane."Snow and hail, mists and
vapours, wind and storm, fulfilling His Word."And it must be
fulfilled, no matter at what cost to individuals or to nations.The
laws of the universe must be carried out, even though the mystery
of sorrow, like the still greater mystery of evil, remains for ever
unexplained."Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"How marvellously beautiful He can make this
world!until we can hardly imagine anything more beautiful in the world
everlasting.Ay, even after such a day as to-day, when the world seems
hardly worth living in, yet we live on, live to wake up unto such a
to-morrow--

But I must wait to speak of it in another page.DAY THE SIXTH


And a day absolutely divine!Not a cloud upon the sky, not a ripple
upon the water, or it appeared so in the distance.Nearer, no doubt,
there would have been that heavy ground-swell which is so long in
subsiding, in fact is scarcely ever absent on this coast.The land,
like the sea, was all one smile; the pasture fields shone in brilliant
green, the cornfields gleaming yellow--at once a beauty and a
thanksgiving.It was the very perfection of an autumn morning.We would not lose
an hour of it, but directly after breakfast started leisurely to
find Housel Cove and try our first experiment of bathing in the wide
Atlantic.Not a rood of land lay between us and
America.Yet the illimitable ocean "where the great ships go down,"
rolled in to our feet in baby ripples, disporting itself harmlessly,
and tempting my two little mermaids to swim out to the utmost limit
that prudence allowed.And how delightful it was to run back barefoot
across the soft sand to the beautiful dressing-room of serpentine
rock, where one could sit and watch the glittering sea, untroubled by
any company save the gulls and cormorants.What a contrast to other
bathing places--genteel Eastbourne and Brighton, or vulgar Margate and
Ramsgate, where, nevertheless, the good folks look equally happy.Shall we stamp ourselves
as persons of little mind, easily satisfied, if I confess that we
spent the whole morning in Housel Cove without band or promenade,
without even a Christy Minstrel or a Punch and Judy, our sole amusement
being the vain attempt to catch a tiny fish, the Robinson Crusoe of
a small pool in the rock above high-water mark, where by some ill
chance he found himself.But he looked extremely contented with his
sea hermitage, and evaded so cleverly all our efforts to get hold of
him, that after a while we left him to his solitude--where possibly he
resides still.[Illustration: THE LIZARD LIGHTS BY DAY.]How delicious it is for hard-worked people to do nothing, absolutely
nothing!Of course only for a little while--a few days, a few hours.The love of work and the necessity for it soon revive.But just for
those few harmless hours to let the world and its duties and cares
alike slip by, to be absolutely idle, to fold one's hands and look
at the sea and the sky, thinking of nothing at all, except perhaps
to count and watch for every ninth wave--said to be the biggest
always--and wonder how big it will be, and whether it will reach that
stone with the little colony of limpets and two red anemones beside
them, or stop short at the rock where we sit placidly dangling our
feet, waiting, Canute-like, for the supreme moment when the will of
humanity sinks conquered by the immutable powers of nature.Then,
greatest crisis of all, the sea will attack that magnificent castle and
moat, which we grown-up babies have constructed with such pride.Well,
have we not all built our sand-castles and seen them swept away?happy
if by no unkinder force than the remorseless wave of Time, which will
soon flow over us all.But how foolish is moralising--making my narrative halt like that horse
whom we amused ourselves with half the afternoon.He was tied by the
leg, poor beast, the fore leg fastened to the hind one, as seemed to be
the ordinary Cornish fashion with all animals--horses, cows, and sheep.It certainly saves a deal of trouble, preventing them from climbing the
"hedges" which form the sole boundary of property, but it makes the
creatures go limping about in rather a melancholy fashion.However,
as it is their normal condition, probably they communicate it to one
another, and each generation accepts its lot.He was a handsome animal, who came and peered at
the sketch which one of us was doing, after the solemn fashion of
quadrupedal connoisseurship, and kept us company all the afternoon.We
sat in a row on the top of the "hedge," enjoying the golden afternoon,
and scarcely believing it possible that yesterday had been yesterday.Of the wild storm and deluge of rain there was not a single trace;
everything looked as lovely as if it had been, and was going to be,
summer all the year.We were so contented, and were making such progress in our sketch and
distant view of Kynance over the now dry and smiling cornfield, that we
had nigh forgotten the duties of civilisation, until some one brought
the news that all the household was apparently dressing itself in its
very best, to attend the rectory tea.We determined to do the same,
though small were our possibilities of toilette."Nobody knows us, and we know
nobody."A position rather rare to those who "dwell among their own people,"
who take a kindly interest in everybody, and believe with a pardonable
credulity that everybody takes a kindly interest in them.But human nature is the same all the world over.And here we saw it in
its pleasantest phase; rich and poor meeting together, not for charity,
but courtesy--a courtesy that was given with a kindliness and accepted
with a quiet independence which seemed characteristic of these Cornish
folk.Among the little crowd, gentle and simple, we, of course, did not know
a single soul.Nevertheless, delivering up our tickets to the gardener
at the gate, we entered, and wandered at ease through the pretty
garden, gorgeous with asters, marigolds, carnations, and all sorts of
rich- and rich-scented autumn flowers; where the hydrangeas
grew in enormous bushes, and the fuchsias had stems as thick and solid
as trees.In front of the open hall door was a gravel sweep where were ranged
two long tea-tables filled with the humbler but respectable class of
parishioners, chiefly elderly people, and some very old.The Lizard is
a place noted for longevity, as is proved by the register books, where
several deaths at over a hundred may be found recorded, and one--he was
the rector of Landewednack in 1683--is said to have died at the age of
120 years.The present rector is no such Methuselah.He moved actively to and fro
among his people, and so did his wife, whom we should have recognised
by her omnipresent kindliness, even if she had not come and welcomed
us strangers--easily singled out as strangers, where all the rest were
friends.Besides the poor and the aged, there was a goodly number of guests
who were neither the one nor the other, playing energetically at
lawn-tennis behind the house, on a "lawn" composed of sea-sand.All
seemed determined to amuse themselves and everybody else, and all did
their very best--including the band.I would fain pass it over in silence (would it
had returned the compliment!); but truth is truth, and may benefit
rather than harm.The calm composure with which those half-dozen
wind-instruments sat in a row, playing determinedly flat, bass coming
in with a tremendous boom here and there, entirely at his own volition,
without regard to time or tune, was the most awful thing I ever heard
in music!Agony, pure and simple, was the only sensation it produced.When they struck up, we just ran away till the tune was ended--what
tune, familiar or unfamiliar, it was impossible to say.Between us
three, all blessed, or cursed, with musical ears, there existed such
difference of opinion on this head, that decision became vain.And
when at last, as the hour of service approached, little groups began
strolling towards the church, the musicians began a final "God save the
Queen," barely recognisable, a feeling of thankfulness was the only
sensation left.[Illustration: THE FISHERMAN'S DAUGHTER--A CORNISH STUDY.]Now, let me not be hard upon these village Orpheuses.They did their
best, and for a working man to study music in any form is a good and
desirable thing.But whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing
well.The great bane of provincial life is that people have so few
opportunities of finding out when they do _not_ do things well, and so
little ambition to learn to do them better.If these few severe remarks
should spur on that anonymous band to try and emulate the Philharmonic
or the Crystal Palace orchestra, it will be all the better for the
little community at the Lizard.A crowded congregation--not a
seat vacant--listened to the excellent chanting, hymns, and a harvest
anthem, most accurately and correctly sung.The organist too--it was
a pleasure to watch that young man's face and see with what interest
and enthusiasm he entered into it all.Besides the rector, there were
several other clergymen, one of whom, an old man, read the prayers
with an intonation and expression which I have rarely heard equalled,
and another preached what would have been called anywhere a thoroughly
good sermon.All the statelier guests at the Rectory tea--probably
county families (one stout lady had the dignity of a duchess at
least)--"assisted" at this evening service, and behind them was a
throng of humbler folk, among whom we recognised our sole friend here,
John Curgenven.We had passed him at the church door, and he had lifted
his hat with the air of a _preux chevalier_ of the olden time; "more
like King Arthur than ever"--we observed to one another.He, and we, and the aristocratic groups, with a few more of the
congregation, lingered for several minutes after service was over,
admiring the beautiful flowers and fruit.I think I never saw any
decorations so rich or so tasteful.And then, as the organ played us
out with an exceedingly brilliant voluntary, the vision of light and
colour melted away, and we came out upon the quiet churchyard, lying in
the cold, still moonlight.Clear as day, the round silver orb sailing
through a cloudless sky of that deep dark which we know is blue, only
moonlight shows no colours.Oh, Lady Moon, Lady Moon, what a dangerous
night for some of those groups to go walking home in!We saw them in
twos and threes, various young people whom we had got to know by sight,
and criticise, and take an interest in, wandering slowly on through
Lizard Town, and then diverging into quieter paths.For there, in an open space near the two hotels
which co-exist close together--I hope amicably, and divide the tourist
custom of the place--in front of a row of open windows which showed the
remains of a _table d'hote_, and playing lively tunes to a group of
delighted listeners, including some children, who had struck up a merry
dance--stood that terrible wind band!All our sympathy with our fellow-creatures, our
pleasure in watching them enjoy themselves, our interest in studying
human nature in the abstract, nay, even the picturesqueness of the
charming moonlight scene, could not tempt us to stay.We paused a
minute, then put our fingers in our ears and fled.Gradually those
fearful sounds melted away into distance, and left us to the silence of
moonshine, and the sight, now grown familiar, but never less beautiful,
of the far-gleaming Lizard Lights.DAY THE SEVENTH


John Curgenven had said last night, with his air of tender patronising,
half regal, half paternal, which we declared always reminded us of King
Arthur--"Ladies, whenever you settle to go to Kynance, I'll take you."And sure enough there he stood, at eight in the morning, quite a
picture, his cap in one hand, a couple of fishes dangling from the
other--he had brought them as a present, and absolutely refused to be
paid--smiling upon us at our breakfast, as benignly as did the sun.He
came to say that he was at our service till 10 A.M.We did not like venturing in strange and
dangerous ground, or rather sea, without our protector.But this was
our last chance, and such a lovely day."You won't come to any harm, ladies," said the consoling John."I'll
take you by a short cut across the down, much better than the cliff.You can't possibly miss your way: it'll lead you straight to Kynance,
and then you go down a steep path to the Cove.You'll have plenty of
time before the tide comes in to see everything.""Oh yes, miss, there's the Drawing-room, the Dining-room, and the
Kitchen--all capital caves close together; I wouldn't advise you to
swim out far, though.And keep a sharp look out for the tide--it runs
in pretty fast.""Oh, you can easy get on Asparagus Island, miss; it's quite safe.Only
don't try the Devil's Throat--or Hell's Mouth, as some folk call it."Neither name was inviting; but studying our guide-books, we thought we
could manage even without our friend.So, long ere the dew was dried on
the sunshiny down, we all started off together, Curgenven slackening
his quick active steps--very light and most enviably active for a man
of his years--to accommodate us, and conversing courteously with us all
the way.[Illustration: KYNANCE COVE, CORNWALL.]"Ower the muir amang the heather" have I tramped many a mile in
bonnie Scotland, but this Cornish moor and Cornish heather were quite
different.As different as the Cornishman with his bright, frank face,
and his mixture of British honesty and Gallic courtesy, from the Scotch
peasant--equally worthy, but sometimes just a trifle "dour."John had plenty to say for himself, and said it well, with a quiet
independence that there was no mistaking; never forgetting meanwhile to
stop and offer a helping hand over every bit of rough road, puddle, or
bog.He gave us a vivid picture of winter life at the Lizard: when the
little community has to hybernate, like the squirrels and field-mice,
upon its summer savings."Sometimes we don't earn a halfpenny for weeks and months, and then if
we've got nothing to fall back upon it's a bad job, you see, ma'am."I asked him if much money went for drink; they seemed to me a
remarkably sober set at the Lizard."Yes, I think we are; we're obliged to be; we can't spend money at the
public-house, for we've got none to spend.I'm no teetotaller myself,"
added John boldly."I don't dislike a glass of beer now and then, if I
can afford it, and when I can't afford it I can do without it, and if I
do take it I always know when to stop."Ay, that is the crucial test--the knowing when to stop.It is this
which makes all the difference between a good man and a villain, a wise
man and a fool.Self-control--a quality which, guided by conscience and
common sense, is the best possession of any human being.And looking at
the honest fisherman, one felt pretty sure he had his share of it."Now I must leave you, ladies," said he, a great deal sooner than we
wished, for we much liked talking to him."My time's nearly up, and I
mustn't keep my gentleman waiting; he goes out in my boat every day,
and has been a good friend to me.The road's straight before you,
ladies; and there's another party just ahead of you.Follow the track,
and you'll soon be at Kynance.It's a lovely day for the Cove, and I
hope you'll enjoy yourselves."John bared his grey head, with a salutation worthy of some old knight
of the Round Table, and then strode back, in double-quick time, as
active and upright as any young fellow of twenty-five, across the level
down.When, afterwards, I stood one dull winter day
in a London Art Gallery, opposite the _Cornish Lions_, how well I
recalled this day!How truly Brett's picture gives the long roll of
the wave upon the silver sands, the richly-tinted rocks and caves, the
brightness and freshness of everything.And those merry girls beside
me, who had the faculty of enjoying all they had, and all they did,
without regretting what they had not or what they might not do--with
heroic resignation they promised not to attempt to swim in the tempting
smooth water beyond the long rollers.Though knocked down again and
again, they always emerged from the waves with shouts of laughter.Mere
dots they looked to my anxious eyes--a couple of corks tossed hither
and thither on the foaming billows--and very thankful I was to get them
safe back into the "drawing-room," the loveliest of lovely caves.There was no time to lose; by noon our parlour floor--what a fairy
floor it was!of the softest, most delicious sand--would be all covered
with waves.And before then there was a deal to be seen and done, the
Bellows, the Gull Rock, Asparagus Island--even if we left out the
dangerous points with the ugly names that Curgenven had warned us
against.What is there in humanity, certainly in youthful humanity, that if
it can attain its end in two ways, one quiet and decorous, the other
difficult and dangerous, is certain to choose the latter?"We must manage to get you to the Bellows, it is such a curious sight,"
said my girls as they returned from it."Don't be frightened--come
along!"By dint of pulling, pushing, and the help of stick and arm, I came:
stood watching the spout of water which, in certain conditions of the
tide, forces itself through a tiny fissure in the rock with a great
roar, and joined in the childish delight of waiting, minute by minute,
for the biggest spout, the loudest roar.But Asparagus Island (where was no asparagus at all) I totally
declined.Not being a goat or a chamois, I contented myself with
sitting where I could gain the best view of the almost invisible
path by which my adventurous young "kids" disappeared.Happily they
had both steady heads and cool nerves; they were neither rash nor
unconscientious.I knew they would come back as soon as they could.So
I waited patiently, contemplating a fellow-victim who seemed worse off
than myself; a benign-looking clergyman, who kept walking up and down
the soppy sands, and shouting at intervals to two young people, a man
and a woman, who appeared to be crawling like flies along the face of
the rock towards another rock, with a yawning cave and a wide fissure
between.the clergyman cried at the top of his voice."Your young people seem rather venturesome," said I sympathetically.[Illustration: THE STEEPLE ROCK, KYNANCE COVE.]"Not _my_ young people," was the dignified answer."My girls are up
there, on Asparagus Rock, which is easy enough climbing.They promised
not to go farther, and they never disobey their mother and me.I declare he is taking her to the most dangerous part, that
rock where you have to jump--a good jump it is, and if you miss your
footing you are done for, you go right into the boiling waves below.Well, it's no business of mine; she is his own property; he is engaged
to her, but"--

I fear I made some very severe remarks on the folly of a young man who
could thus risk life and limbs--not only his own, but those of his wife
to be; and on the weakness of a girl who could allow herself to be
tempted, even by a lover, into such selfish foolhardiness."They must manage their own affairs," said the old gentleman
sententiously, perhaps not being so much given to preaching (out of the
pulpit) as I was.And very sensible girls they looked, clad in a practical, convenient
fashion, just fitted for scrambling.By them I sent a message to my own
girls, explaining the best descent from Asparagus Island, and repeating
the warning against attempting Hell's Mouth."Yes, you are quite right," said my elderly friend, as we sat down
together on the least uncomfortable stone we could find, and watched
the juniors disappear over the rocks."I like to see girls active and
brave; I never hinder them in any reasonable enjoyment, even though
there may be risk in it--one must run some risk--and a woman may
have to save life as well as a man.But foolhardy bravado I not only
dislike--I _despise_ it."In which sentiments I so entirely agreed that we fraternised there
and then; began talking on all sorts of subjects--some of them the
very serious and earnest subjects that one occasionally drops into by
mere chance, with mere strangers.I recall that half hour on Kynance
Sands as one of the pleasant memories of our tour, though to this day
I have not the remotest idea who my companion was.Except that as soon
as he spoke I recognised the reader whose voice had so struck me in
last night's thanksgiving service; reminding me of Frederick Denison
Maurice, whom this generation is almost beginning to forget, but whom
we elders never can forget.The tide was creeping on now--nay, striding, wave after wave, through
"parlour" and "drawing-room," making ingress and egress alike
impossible.In fact, a newly arrived party of tourists, who had stood
unwisely long contemplating the Bellows, were seen to gaze in despair
from their rock which had suddenly become an island.No chance for them
except to wade--and in a few minutes more they would probably have
to swim ashore.What became of them we did not stay to see, for an
anxious, prudent little voice, always thoughtful for "mother," insisted
on our precipitate flight before the advancing tide.Kynance, lovely as
it is, has its inconveniences.Departing, we met a whole string of tourist-looking people, whom we
benevolently warned that they were too late, at which they did not
seem in the least disappointed.Probably they were one of the numerous
pic-nic parties who come here from Falmouth or Helstone, to spend a
jovial day of eating and drinking, and enjoy the delights of the flesh
rather than the spirit.At any rate the romance and solitude of the place were gone.The quaint
old woman at the serpentine shop--a mild little wooden erection under
the cliff--was being chaffed and bargained with by three youths with
cigars, which defiled the whole air around, and made us take refuge up
the hill.But even there a white umbrella had sprung up like a gigantic
mushroom, and under it sat an energetic lady artist, who, entering at
once into conversation, with a cheerful avidity that implied her not
having talked for a week, informed us of all she was painting, and all
she had meant to paint, where she lodged, and how much she paid for her
lodging--evidently expecting the same confidences from us in return.But we were getting hungry, and between us and dinner was a long
two-miles walk over the steep downs, that were glowing, nay, burning,
under the September sun.So we turned homeward, glad of more than one
rest by the way, and a long pause beside a pretty little stream; where
we were able to offer the immemorial cup of cold water to several
thirsty souls besides ourselves.Some of us by this time were getting
to feel not so young as we had fancied ourselves in the early morning,
and to wish regretfully for Charles and his carriage.However, we got home at last--to find that sad accompaniment of many a
holiday--tidings of sickness and death.Nothing very near us--nothing
that need hurry us home--but enough to sadden us, and make our evening
walk, which we bravely carried out, a far less bright one than that of
the forenoon.The girls had found a way, chiefly on the tops of "hedges," to the
grand rock called Lizard Point.Thither we went, and watched the
sunset--a very fine one; then came back through the village, and made
various purchases of serpentine from John Curgenven's wife, who was
a great deal younger than himself, but not near so handsome or so
original.But a cloud had come over us; it did not, and must not stay--still,
there it was for the time.When the last thing at night I went out into
the glorious moonlight--bright as day--and thought of the soul who had
just passed out of a long and troubled life into the clearness of life
eternal, it seemed as if all was right still.Small cares and worries
dwindled down or melted away--as the petty uglinesses around melted
in the radiance of this glorious harvest moon, which seemed to wrap
one round in a silent peace, like the "garment of praise," which David
speaks about--in exchange for "the spirit of heaviness."DAY THE EIGHTH


And seven days were all we could allow ourselves at the Lizard, if we
meant to see the rest of Cornwall.We began to reckon with sore hearts
that five days were already gone, and it seemed as if we had not seen
half we ought to see, even of our near surroundings."We will take no excursion to-day.We will just have our bath at Housel
Cove and then we will wander about the shore, and examine the Lizard
Lights.Only fancy, our going away to-morrow without having seen the
inside of the Lizard Lights!Oh, I wish we were not leaving so soon.We
shall never like any place as we like the Lizard."Directly after breakfast--and we are
people who never vary from our eight o'clock breakfast, so that we
always see the world in its early morning brightness and freshness--we
went

  "Brushing with hasty steps the dew away,"

along the fields, which led down to Housel or Househole Cove.Before
us, clear in the sunshine, rose the fine headland of Penolver, and
the green <DW72>s of the amphitheatre of Belidden, supposed to be the
remains of a Druidical temple.That, and the chair of Belidden, a
recess in the rock, whence there is a splendid view, with various
archaeological curiosities, true or traditionary, we ought to have
examined, I know.Some of us were content to
rejoice in the general atmosphere of beauty and peace without minute
investigation, and some of us were so eminently practical that "a good
bathe" appeared more important than all the poetry and archaeology in
the world.So we wandered slowly on, rejoicing at having the place all to
ourselves, when we came suddenly upon a tall black figure intently
watching three other black figures, or rather dots, which were climbing
slowly over Penolver.It was our clerical friend of Kynance; with whom, in the natural and
right civility of holiday-makers, we exchanged a courteous good morning.[Illustration: THE LION ROCKS--A SEA IN WHICH NOTHING CAN LIVE.]"Yes, those are my girls up on the cliff there.They have been bathing,
and are now going to walk to Cadgwith.""Then nobody fell into the Devil's Throat at Kynance?They all came
back to you with whole limbs?""Yes," said he smiling, "and they went again for another long walk
in the afternoon.At night, when it turned out to be such splendid
moonlight, they actually insisted on going launce-fishing.Of course
you know about launce-fishing?"I pleaded my utter ignorance of that noble sport."Oh, it is _the_ thing at the Lizard.My boys--and girls too--consider
it the best fun going.The launce is a sort of sand-eel peculiar to
these coasts.It swims about all day, and at night burrows in the sand
just above the waterline, where, when the moon shines on it, you can
trace the silvery gleam of the creature.So you stand up to your ankles
on wet sand, with a crooked iron spear which you dart in and hook him
up, keeping your left hand free to seize him with.""Easy fishing," said I, with a certain pity for the sand-eel.You are apt either to chop him right in
two, or miss him altogether, when off he wriggles in the sand and
disappears.My young people say it requires a practised hand and a
peculiar twist of the wrist, to have any success at all in launce
fishing.It can only be done on moonlight nights--the full moon and
a day or two after--and they are out half the night.They go about
barefoot, which is much safer than soaked shoes and stockings.About
midnight they light a fire on the sand, cook all the fish they have
caught, and have a grand supper, as they had last night.They came home
as merry as crickets about two o'clock this morning.Perhaps you might
not have noticed what a wonderful moonlight night it was?"I had; but it would not have occurred to me to spend it in standing for
hours up to the knees in salt water, catching unfortunate fish.However, tastes differ, and launce-fishing may be a prime delight to
some people; so I faithfully chronicle it, and the proper mode of
pursuing it, as one of the attractions at the Lizard.I am not aware
that it is practised at any other part of the Cornish coast, nor can
I say whether or not it was a pastime of King Arthur and his Knights.One cannot imagine Sir Tristram or Sir Launcelot occupied in spearing a
small sand-eel.The bathing at Housel Cove was delightful as ever.And afterwards we
saw that very rare and beautiful sight, a perfect solar rainbow.Not
the familiar bow of Noah, but a great luminous circle round the sun,
like the halo often seen round the moon, extending over half the sky;
yellow at first, then gradually assuming faint prismatic tints.This
colouring, though never so bright as the ordinary arched rainbow, was
wonderfully tender and delicate.We stood a long time watching it,
till at last it melted slowly out of the sky, leaving behind a sense of
mystery, as of something we had never seen before and might never see
again in all our lives.It was a lovely day, bright and warm as midsummer, tempting us to some
distant excursion; but we had decided to investigate the Lizard Lights.We should have been content to take them for granted, in their purely
poetical phase, as we had watched them night after night.But some of
us were blessed with scientific relatives, who would have despised us
utterly if we had spent a whole week at the Lizard and never gone to
see the Lizard Lights.So we felt bound to do our duty, and admire, if
we could not understand.I chronicle with shame that the careful and
courteous explanations of that most intelligent young man, who met us
at the door of the huge white building, apparently quite glad to have
an opportunity of conducting us through it, were entirely thrown away.We mounted ladders, we looked at Brobdingnagian lamps, we poked into
mysterious machinery for lighting them and for sounding the fog-horn,
we listened to all that was told us, and tried to look as if we took it
in.Very much interested we could not but be at such wonderful results
of man's invention, but as for comprehending!we came away with our
minds as dark as when we went in.I have always found through life that, next to being clever, the safest
thing is to know one's own ignorance and acknowledge it.Therefore let
me leave all description of the astonishing mechanism of the Lizard
Lights--I believe the first experiment of their kind, and not very
long established--to abler pens and more intelligent brains.To see
that young man, scarcely above the grade of a working man, handling
his instruments and explaining them and their uses, seeming to take
for granted that we could understand--which alas!we didn't, not
an atom!--inspired me with a sense of humiliation and awe.Also of
pride at the wonders this generation has accomplished, and is still
accomplishing; employing the gradually comprehended forces of Nature
against herself, as it were, and dominating her evil by ever-new
discoveries and applications of the recondite powers of good.The enormous body of light produced nightly--equal, I think he said,
to 30,000 candles--and the complicated machinery for keeping the
fog-horn continually at work, when even that gigantic blaze became
invisible--all this amount of skill, science, labour, and money,
freely expended for the saving of life, gave one a strong impression of
not only British power but British beneficence.Could King Arthur have
come back again from his sea-engulfed Land of Lyonesse, and stood where
we stood, beside the Lizard Lights, what would he have said to it all?[Illustration: HAULING IN THE BOATS.]Even though we did not understand, we were keenly interested in all we
saw, and still more so in the stories of wrecks which this young man
had witnessed even during the few years, or months--I forget which--of
his stay at the Lizard.He, too, agreed, that the rocks there, called
by the generic name of the Stags, were the most fatal of all on our
coasts to ships outward and homeward bound.Probably because in the
latter case, captain and crews get a trifle careless; and in the
former--as I have heard in sad explanation of many emigrant ships being
lost almost immediately after quitting port--they get drunk.Many of
the sailors are said to come on board "half-seas over," and could the
skilfullest of pilots save a ship with a drunken crew?Be that as it may, the fact remains, that throughout winter almost
every week's chronicle at the Lizard is the same story--wild storms, or
dense fogs, guns of distress heard, a hasty manning of the life-boat,
dragged with difficulty down the steep cliff-road, a brief struggle
with the awful sea, and then, even if a few lives are saved, with the
ship herself all is over."Only last Christmas I saw a vessel go to pieces in ten minutes on the
rocks below there," said the man, after particularising several wrecks,
which seemed to have imprinted themselves on his memory with all their
incidents."Yes, we have a bad time in winter, and the coastguard
men lead a risky life.They are the picked men of the service, and
tolerably well paid, but no money could ever pay them for what they go
through--or the fishermen, who generally are volunteers, and get little
or nothing.""It must be a hard life in these parts, especially in winter," we
observed."Well, perhaps it is, but it's our business, you see."Yes, but not all people do their business, as the mismanagements and
mistakes of this world plainly show.Still, it is a good world, and we felt it so as we strolled along the
sunshiny cliff, talking over all these stories, tragical or heroic,
which had been told us in such a simple matter-of-fact way, as if they
were every-day occurrences.And then, while the young folks went on
"for a good scramble" over Penolver, I sat down for a quiet "think";
that enforced rest, which, as years advance, becomes not painful, but
actually pleasant; in which, if one fails to solve the problems of the
universe, one is prone to con them over, wondering at them all.From the sunny sea and sunny sky, full of a silence so complete that I
could hear every wave as it broke on the unseen rocks below, my mind
wandered to that young fellow among his machinery, with his sickly
eager face and his short cough--indicating that _his_ "business" in
this world, over which he seemed so engrossed, might only too soon
come to an end.Between these apparently eternal powers of Nature,
so strong, so fierce, so irresistible, against which man fought so
magnificently with all his perfection of scientific knowledge and
accuracy of handiwork--and this poor frail human life, which in a
moment might be blown out like a candle, suddenly quenched in darkness,
"there is no skill or knowledge in the grave whither thou goest"--what
a contrast it was!And yet--and yet?--We shall sleep with our fathers, and some of us feel
sometimes so tired that we do not in the least mind going to sleep.But
notwithstanding this, notwithstanding everything without that seems to
imply our perishableness, we are conscious of something within which
is absolutely imperishable.We feel it only stronger and clearer as
life begins to melt away from us; as "the lights in the windows are
darkened, and the daughters of music are brought low."To the young,
death is often a terror, for it seems to put an end to the full, rich,
passionate life beyond which they can see nothing; but to the old,
conscious that this their tabernacle is being slowly dissolved, and yet
its mysterious inhabitant, the wonderful, incomprehensible _me_, is
exactly the same--thinks, loves, suffers, and enjoys, precisely as it
did heaven knows how many years ago--to them, death appears in quite
another shape.He is no longer Death the Enemy, but Death the Friend,
who may--who can tell?--give back all that life has denied or taken
away.He cannot harm us, and he may bless us, with the blessing of
loving children, who believe that, whatever happens, nothing can take
them out of their Father's arms.But I had not come to Cornwall to preach, except to myself now and
then, as this day.My silent sermon was all done by the time the
young folks came back, full of the beauties of their cliff walk, and
their affectionate regrets that I "could never manage it," but must
have felt so dull, sitting on a stone and watching the sheep and the
sea-gulls.I was obliged to confess that I never am "dull,"
as people call it, and love solitude almost as much as society.[Illustration: ENYS DODNAN AND PARDENICK POINTS.]So, each contented in our own way, we went merrily home, to find
waiting for us our cosy tea--the last!--and our faithful Charles, who,
according to agreement, appeared overnight, to take charge of us till
we got back to civilisation and railways."Yes, ladies, here I am," said he with a beaming countenance."And
I've got you the same carriage and the same horse, as you wished, and
I've come in time to give him a good night's rest.Now, when shall you
start, and what do you want to do to-morrow?"Our idea had been to take for our next resting-place Marazion.This
queer-named town had attracted us ever since the days when we learnt
geography.Since, we had heard a good deal about it: how it had
been inhabited by Jewish colonists, who bought tin from the early
Ph[oe]nician workers of the Cornish mines, and been called by them
Mara-Zion--bitter Zion--corrupted by the common people into Market-Jew.Michael's Mount opposite; and attracted
us much more than genteel Penzance.So did a letter we got from the
landlord of its one hotel, promising to take us in, and make us
thoroughly comfortable.Charles declared we could, and even see
a good deal on the road.Mary will be delighted to get another
peep at you ladies, and while I rest the horse you can go in and look
at the old church--it's very curious, they say.And then we'll go on
to Gunwalloe,--there's another church there, close by the sea, built
by somebody who was shipwrecked.But then it's so old and so small.However, we can stop and look at it if you like."His good common sense, and kindliness, when he might so easily have
done his mere duty and taken us the shortest and ugliest route, showing
us nothing, decided us to leave all in Charles's hands, and start at
10 A.M.for Penzance, _via_ Helstone, where we all wished to
stay an hour or two, and find out a "friend," the only one we had in
Cornwall.So all was settled, with but a single regret, that several boating
excursions we had planned with John Curgenven had all fallen through,
and we should never behold some wonderful sea-caves between the Lizard
and Cadgwith, which we had set our hearts upon visiting.Charles fingered his cap with a thoughtful air."I don't see why you
shouldn't, ladies.If I was to go direct and tell John Curgenven to
have a boat ready at Church Cove, and we was to start at nine instead
of ten, and drive there, the carriage might wait while you rowed to
the caves and back; we should still reach Helstone by dinner-time, and
Marazion before dark."And at this addition to his
work Charles looked actually pleased!So--all was soon over, our easy packing done, our bill paid--a very
small one--our goodnights said to the kindly handmaid, Esther, who
hoped we would come back again some time, and promised to keep the
artistic mural decorations of our little parlour in memory of us.My
young folks went to bed, and then, a little before midnight, when all
the house was quiet, I put a shawl over my head, unlatched the innocent
door--no bolts or bars at the Lizard--and went out into the night.What a night it was!--mild as summer, clear as day: the full moon
sailing aloft in an absolutely cloudless sky.Not a breath, not a
sound--except the faint thud-thud of the in-coming waves, two miles
off, at Kynance, the outline of which, and of the whole coast, was
distinctly visible.A silent earth, lying under a silent heaven.Looking up, one felt almost like a disembodied soul, free to cleave
through infinite space and gain--what?Is it human or divine, this ceaseless longing after something never
attained, this craving after the eternal life, which, if fully believed
in, fully understood, would take all the bitterness out of this life?But so much is given, and all given is so infinitely good, except where
we ourselves turn it into evil, that surely more, and better, will be
given to us by and by.Those only truly enjoy life who fear not death:
who can say of the grave as if it were their bed: "I will lay me down
in peace and take my rest, for it is Thou only, O God, who makest me to
dwell in safety."DAY THE NINTH


And our last at the Lizard, which a week ago had been to us a mere word
or dot in a map; now we carried away from it a living human interest in
everything and everybody.Esther bade us a cordial farewell: Mrs.Curgenven, standing at the
door of her serpentine shop, repeated the good wishes, and informed
us that John and his boat had already started for Church Cove.As we
drove through the bright little Lizard Town, and past the Church of
Landewednack, wondering if we should ever see either again, we felt
quite sad.Leaving the carriage and Charles at the nearest point to the Cove, we
went down the steep descent, and saw John rocking in his boat, and
beckoning to us with a bland and smiling countenance.But between us
and him lay a sort of causeway, of the very roughest rocks, slippery
with sea-weed, and beat upon by waves--such waves!Yet clearly, if we
meant to get into the boat at all, we must seize our opportunity and
jump in between the flux and reflux of that advancing tide.I am not a coward: I love boats, and was well used to them in my youth,
but now--my heart misgave me.There were but two alternatives--to
stop the pleasure of the whole party, and leave Cornwall with these
wonderful sea-caves unseen, or to let my children go alone.Neither was
possible; so I hailed a sturdy youth at work hard by, and asked him if
he would take charge of an old lady across the rocks.He grinned from
ear to ear, but came forward, and did his duty manfully and kindly.My
young folks, light as feathers, bounded after; and with the help of
John Curgenven, chivalrous and careful as ever, we soon found ourselves
safely in the boat.[Illustration: JOHN CURGENVEN FISHING.]"Here we go up, up, up, and here we go down,
down, down," was the principle of our voyage, the most serious one we
ever took in an open boat with a single pair of oars.Never did I see
such waves,--at least, never did I float upon them, in a boat that went
tossing like a bit of cork out into the open sea.John seemed not to mind them in the least.His strong arms swept the
boat along, and he still found breath to talk to us, pointing out the
great gloomy cliffs we were passing under, and telling us stories of
wrecks, the favourite theme--and no wonder.This sunshiny morning that iron-bound coast looked awful enough; what
must it have looked like, on the winter night when the emigrant ship
_Brest_ went down!"Yes, it was about ten o'clock at night," said John."I was fast asleep
in bed, but they knocked me up; I got on my clothes and was off in
five minutes.They are always glad enough to get us fishermen, the
coastguard are.Mine was the first boat-load we brought ashore; we
would only take women and children that time.They were all in their
night-gowns, and they couldn't speak a word of English, but we made
them understand somehow.One woman threw her three children down to me,
and stayed behind on the wreck with two more.""Oh, no, they were very quiet, dazed like.Some of them seemed to be
saying their prayers.But they made no fuss at all, not even the little
ones.They lay down in the bottom of the boat, and we rowed ashore
as fast as we could, to Cadgwith.Then we rowed back and fetched two
boatloads more.We saved a lot of lives that wreck, but only their
lives; they had scarcely a rag of clothes on, and some of the babies
were as naked as when they were born.""Everybody: we always do it," answered John, as if surprised at
the question."The fishermen's cottages were full, and so was the
parsonage.We gave them clothes, and kept them till they could be sent
away.Yes, it was an awful night; I got something to remember it by,
here."He held out his hand, from which we noticed half of one finger was
missing."It got squeezed off with a rope somehow.I didn't heed it much at
the time," said John carelessly."But look, we're at the first of the
caves.I'll row in close, ladies, and let you see it."So we had to turn our minds from the vision of the wreck of the
_Brest_, which John's simple words made so terribly vivid, to examine
Raven's Ugo, and Dolor Ugo; _ugo_ is Cornish for cave.Over the
entrance of the first a pair of ravens have built from time immemorial.It is just accessible, the opening being above the sea-line, and hung
with quantities of sea-ferns.Here in smuggling days, many kegs of
spirits used to be secreted: and many a wild drama no doubt has been
acted there--daring encounters between smugglers and coastguard men,
not bloodless on either side.Dolor Ugo is now inaccessible and unusable.Its only floor is of
heaving water, a deep olive green, and so clear that we could see the
fishes swimming about pursuing a shoal of launce.Its high-vaulted roof
and sides were tinted all colours--rose-pink, rich dark brown, and
purple.The entrance was wide enough to admit a boat, but it gradually
narrowed into impenetrable darkness.How far inland it goes no one can
tell, as it could only be investigated by swimming, a rather dangerous
experiment.Boats venture as far as the daylight goes; and it is a
favourite trick of the boatman suddenly to fire off a pistol, which
reverberates like thunder through the mysterious gloom of the cave.A solemn place; an awful place, some of us thought, as we rowed in, and
out again, into the sunshiny open sea.Which we had now got used to;
and it was delicious to go dancing like a feather up and down, trusting
to John Curgenven's stout arm and fearless, honest face.We felt sad to
think this would be our last sight of him and of the magnificent Lizard
coast.But the minutes were lessening, and we had some way still to
row.Also to land, which meant a leap between the waves upon slippery
sea-weedy rocks.In silent dread I watched my children accomplish this
feat, and then--

Well, it is over, and I sit here writing these details.But I would
not do it again, not even for the pleasure of revisiting Dolor Ugo and
having a row with John Curgenven.he looked relieved when he saw "the old lady" safe on
_terra firma_, and we left him waving adieux, as he "rocked in his
boat in the bay."May his stout arms and kindly heart long remain to
him!May his summer tourists be many and his winter shipwrecks few!I am sure he will always do his duty, and see that other people do
theirs, or, like the proverbial Cornishmen, he "will know the reason
why."Charles was ready; waiting patiently in front of a blacksmith's shop.fate had overtaken us in the shape of an innocent leak in
John Curgenven's boat; nothing, doubtless, to him, who was in the habit
of baling it out with his boots, and then calmly putting them on again,
but a little inconvenient to us.To drive thirty miles with one's
garments soaked up to the knees was not desirable.There was a cottage close by, whence came the gleam of a delicious fire
and the odour of ironing clothes.We went in: the mistress, evidently
a laundress, advanced and offered to dry us--which she did, chattering
all the while in the confidential manner of country folks.A hard working, decent body she was, and as for her house, it was a
perfect picture of cleanliness and tidiness.Its two rooms, kitchen and
bedroom, were absolutely speckless.When we noticed this, and said we
found the same in many Cornish cottages; she almost seemed offended at
the praise."Oh, that's nothing, ma'am.We hereabouts all likes to have our places
tidy.Mine's not over tidy to-day because of the washing.But if you was to come of a Sunday.Her eye
caught something in a dark corner, at which she flew, apron in hand."I
declare, I'm quite ashamed.I didn't think we had one in the house."Dried, warmed, and refreshed, but having found the greatest difficulty
in inducing the good woman to receive any tangible thanks for her
kindness, we proceeded on our journey; going over the same ground which
we had traversed already, and finding Pradenack Down as bleak and
beautiful as ever.Our first halt was at the door of Mary Mundy, who,
with her unappreciated brother, ran out to meet us, and looked much
disappointed when she found we had not come to stay."But you will come some time, ladies, and I'll make you so comfortable.And you'll give my duty to the professor"--it was vain to explain that
four hundred miles lay between our home and his.He was a very nice gentleman, please'm.I shall be delighted to
see him again, please'm," &c., &c.

We left the three--Mary, her brother, and Charles--chattering together
in a dialect which I do not attempt to reproduce, and sometimes could
hardly understand.Us, the natives indulged with their best English,
but among themselves they talked the broadest Cornish.It was a very old church, and a preternaturally old beadle showed it in
a passive manner, not recognising in the least its points of interest
and beauty, except some rows of open benches with ancient oak backs,
wonderfully carved."Our vicar dug them up from under the flooring and turned them into
pews.There was a gentleman here the other day who said there was
nothing like them in all England."Most curious, in truth, they were, and suited well the fine old
building--a specimen of how carefully and lavishly our forefathers
built "for God."We, who build for ourselves, are rather surprised
to find in out-of-the-way nooks like this, churches that in size and
adornment must have cost years upon years of loving labour as well as
money.It was pleasant to know that the present incumbent, a man of
archaeological tastes, appreciated his blessings, and took the utmost
care of his beautiful old church.even though he cannot
boast the power of his predecessor, the Reverend Thomas Flavel, who
died in 1682, and whose monument in the chancel really expresses the
sentiments--in epitaph--of the period:

  "Earth, take thine earth; my sin, let Satan have it;
  The world my goods; my soul my God who gave it.For from these four, Earth, Satan, World, and God,
  My flesh, my sin, my goods, my soul, I had."But it does not mention that the reverend gentleman was the best
_ghost-layer_ in all England, and that when he died his ghost also
required to be laid, by a brother clergyman, in a spot on the down
still pointed out by the people of Mullion, who, being noted for
extreme longevity, have passed down this tradition from generation
to generation, with an earnest credulity that we of more enlightened
counties can hardly understand.From Mullion we went on to Gunwalloe.Its church, "small and old," as
Charles had depreciatingly said, had been so painfully "restored,"
and looked so bran-new and uninteresting that we contented ourselves
with a distant look.It was close to the sea--probably built on the
very spot where its pious founder had been cast ashore.The one curious
point about it was the detached belfry, some yards distant from the
church itself.It sat alone in a little cove, down which a sluggish
river crawled quietly seaward.A sweet quiet place, but haunted, as
usual, by tales of cruel shipwrecks--of sailors huddled for hours on
a bit of rock just above the waves, till a boat could put out and
save the few survivors; of sea treasures continually washed ashore
from lost ships--Indian corn, coffee, timber, dollars--many are still
found in the sand after a storm.And one treasure more, of which the
recollection is still kept at Gunwalloe, "a little dead baby in its cap
and night-gown, with a necklace of coral beads."Our good horse, with the dogged
persistency of Cornish horses and Cornish men, plodded on mile after
mile.Sometimes for an hour or more we did not meet a living soul;
then we came upon a stray labourer, or passed through a village where
healthy-looking children, big-eyed, brown-faced, and dirty-handed,
picturesque if not pretty, stared at us from cottage doors, or from the
gates of cottage gardens full of flowers and apples.Hungry and thirsty, we could not
resist them.After passing several trees, hung thickly with delicious
fruit, we attacked the owner of one of them, a comely young woman, with
a baby in her arms and another at her gown."Oh yes, ma'am, you may have as many apples as you like, if your young
ladies will go and get them."And while they did it, she stood talking by the carriage door, pouring
out to me her whole domestic history with a simple frankness worthy of
the golden age."No, really I couldn't," putting back my payment--little enough-- for
the splendid basket of apples which the girls brought back in triumph."This is such a good apple year; the pigs would get them if the young
ladies didn't.You're kindly welcome to them--well then, if you are
determined, say sixpence."On which magnificent "sixpenn'orth," we lived for days!Indeed I think
we brought some of it home as a specimen of Cornish fruit and Cornish
liberality.[Illustration: THE ARMED KNIGHT AND THE LONG SHIP'S LIGHTHOUSE.]Helstone was reached at last, and we were not sorry for rest and food
in the old-fashioned inn, whence we could look out of window, and
contemplate the humours of the little town, which doubtless considered
itself a very great one.It was market day, and the narrow street was
thronged with beasts and men--the latter as sober as the former,
which spoke well for Cornwall.Sober and civil too was every one we
addressed in asking our way to the house of our unknown friend, whose
only address we had was Helstone.But he seemed well known in the town,
though neither a rich man, nor a great man, nor--No, I cannot say he
was not a clever man, for in his own line, mechanical engineering, he
must have been exceedingly clever.And he was what people call "a great
character;" would have made such an admirable study for a novelist,
manipulated into an unrecognisable ideal--the only way in which it is
fair to put people in books.When I saw him I almost regretted that I
write novels no more.We passed through the little garden--all ablaze with autumn colour,
every inch utilised for either flowers, vegetables, or fruit--went into
the parlour, sent our cards and waited the result.In two minutes our friend appeared, and gave us such a welcome!But to
explain it I must trench a little upon the sanctities of private life,
and tell the story of this honest Cornishman.When still young he went to Brazil, and was employed by an English
gold-mining company there, for some years.Afterwards he joined
an engineering firm, and superintended dredging, the erection of
saw-mills, &c., finally building a lighthouse, of which latter work he
had the sole charge, and was exceedingly proud.His conscientiousness,
probity, and entire reliableness made him most valuable to the
firm; whom he served faithfully for many years.When they, as well
as himself, returned to England, he still kept up a correspondence
with them, preserving towards every member of the family the most
enthusiastic regard and devotion.He rushed into the parlour, a tall, gaunt, middle-aged man, with a
shrewd, kindly face, which beamed all over with delight, as he began
shaking hands indiscriminately, saying how kind it was of us to come,
and how welcome we were.It was explained which of us he had specially to welcome, the others
being only humble appendages, friends of the family, this well-beloved
family, whose likenesses for two generations we saw everywhere about
the room."Yes, miss, there they all are, your dear grandfather" (alas, only a
likeness now!They were all so good to
me, and I would do anything for them, or for any one of their name.If
I got a message that they wanted me for anything, I'd be off to London,
or to Brazil, or anywhere, in half-an-hour."added the good man when the rapture and
excitement of the moment had a little subsided, and his various
questions as to the well-being of "the family" had been asked and
answered."You have dined, you say, but you'll have a cup of tea.My
wife (that's the little maid I used to talk to your father about, miss;
I always told him I wouldn't stay in Brazil, I must go back to England
and marry my little maid), my wife makes the best cup of tea in all
Cornwall.And there entered, in afternoon gown and cap, probably just put on, a
middle-aged, but still comely matron, who insisted that, even at this
early hour--3 P.M.--to get a cup of tea for us was "no trouble
at all.""Indeed, she wouldn't think anything a trouble, no more than I should,
miss, if it was for your family.It was here suggested that they were not a "forgetting" family.Nor
was he a man likely to be soon forgotten.While the cup of tea, which
proved to be a most sumptuous meal, was preparing, he took us all over
his house, which was full of foreign curiosities, and experimental
inventions.One, I remember, being a musical instrument, a sort of
organ, which he had begun making when a mere boy, and taken with him
all the way to Brazil and back.It had now found refuge in the little
room he called his "workshop," which was filled with odds and ends that
would have been delightful to a mechanical mind.He expounded them with
enthusiasm, and we tried not to betray an ignorance, which in some of
us would have been a sort of hereditary degradation.they were clever--your father and your uncle!--and how proud we
all were when we finished our lighthouse, and got the Emperor to light
it up for the first time.Look here, ladies, what do you think this is?"He took out a small parcel, and solemnly unwrapped from it fold after
fold of paper, till he came to the heart of it--a small wax candle!"This was the candle the Emperor used to light our lighthouse.I've
kept it for nearly thirty years, and I'll keep it as long as I live.Every year on the anniversary of the day I light it, drink his
Majesty's health, and the health of all your family, miss, and then I
put it out again.So"--carefully re-wrapping the relic in its numerous
envelopes--"so I hope it will last my time."Here the mistress came behind her good man, and they exchanged a
smile--the affectionate smile of two who had never been more than two,
Darby and Joan, but all sufficient to each other.How we got through it I hardly know,
but travelling is hungry work, and the viands were delicious.The
beneficence of our kind hosts, however, was not nearly done."Come, ladies, I'll show you my garden, and--(give me a basket and the
grape-scissors,)" added he in a conjugal aside.Which resulted in our
carrying away with us the biggest bunches in the whole vinery, as well
as a quantity of rosy apples, stuffed into every available pocket and
bag."Nonsense, nonsense," was the answer to vain remonstrances."D'ye
think I wouldn't give the best of everything I had to your family?How your father used to laugh at me about my
little maid!Oh yes, I'm glad I came
home.And now your father and your uncle are home too, and perhaps some
day they'll come to see me down here--wouldn't it be a proud day for
me!It was touching, and rare as touching, this passionate personal
fidelity.It threw us back, at least such of us as were sentimentally
inclined, upon that something in Cornish nature which found its
exposition in Arthur and his faithful knights, down to "bold Sir
Bedevere," and apparently, is still not lost in Cornwall.With a sense of real regret, feeling that it would be long ere we
might meet his like--such shrewd simplicity, earnest enthusiasm, and
exceeding faithfulness--we bade good-bye to the honest man; leaving him
and his wife standing at their garden-gate, an elderly Adam and Eve,
desiring nothing outside their own little paradise.Which of us could
say more, or as much?Gratefully we "talked them over," as we drove on through the pretty
country round Helstone--inland country; for we had no time to go and
see the Loe Pool, a small lake, divided from the sea by a bar of sand.This is supposed to be the work of the Cornwall man-demon, Tregeagle;
and periodically cut through, with solemn ceremonial, by the Mayor of
Helstone, when the "meeting of the waters," fresh and salt, is said to
be an extremely curious sight.But we did not see it, nor yet Nonsloe
House, close by, which is held by the tenure of having to provide a
boat and nets whenever the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Cornwall
wishes to fish in the Loe Pool.A circumstance which has never happened
yet, certainly!Other curiosities _en route_ we also missed, the stones of
Tremenkeverne, half a ton each, used as missiles in a notable fight
between two saints, St.Just of the Land's End, and St.Keverne of the
Lizard, and still lying in a field to prove the verity of the legend.Also the rock of Goldsithney, where, when the "fair land of Lyonesse"
was engulfed by the sea, an ancestor of the Trevelyans saved himself by
swimming his horse, and landing; and various other remarkable places,
with legends attached, needing much credulity, or imagination, to
believe in.But, fearing to be benighted ere reaching Marazion, we passed them all,
and saw nothing more interesting than the ruins of disused tin mines,
which Charles showed us, mournfully explaining how the mining business
had of late years drifted away from Cornwall, and how hundreds of the
once thriving community had been compelled to emigrate or starve.As we
neared Marazion, these melancholy wrecks with their little hillocks of
mining debris rose up against the evening sky, the image of desolation.Michael's Mount, the picture in little of Mont St.Michel,
in Normandy, appeared in the middle of Mount's Bay.Lastly, after
a gorgeous sunset, in a golden twilight and silvery moonlight, we
entered Marazion;-and found it, despite its picturesque name, the most
commonplace little town imaginable!We should have regretted our rash decision, and gone on to Penzance,
but for the hearty welcome given us at a most comfortable and home-like
inn, which determined us to keep to our first intention, and stay.So, after our habit of making the best of things, we walked down to the
ugly beach, and investigated the dirty-looking bay--in the lowest of
all low tides, with a soppy, sea-weedy causeway running across to St.By advice of Charles, we made acquaintance with an old
boatman he knew, a Norwegian who had drifted hither--shipwrecked, I
believe--settled down and married an English woman, but whose English
was still of the feeblest kind.However, he had an honest face; so we
engaged him to take us out bathing early to-morrow."Wouldn't you
like to row round the Mount?--When you've had your tea, I'll come back
for you, and help you down to the shore--it's rather rough, but nothing
like what you have done, ma'am," added he encouragingly."And it will
be bright moonlight, and the Mount will look so fine."So, the spirit of adventure conquering our weariness, we went.When
I think how it looked next morning--the small, shallow bay, with its
toy-castle in the centre, I am glad our first vision of it was under
the glamour of moonlight, with the battlemented rock throwing dark
shadows across the shimmering sea.In the mysterious beauty of that
night row round the Mount, we could imagine anything; its earliest
inhabitant, the giant Cormoran, killed by that "valiant Cornishman,"
the illustrious Jack; the lovely St.Keyne, a king's daughter, who came
thither on pilgrimage; and, passing down from legend to history, Henry
de la Pomeroy, who, being taken prisoner, caused himself to be bled to
death in the Castle; Sir John Arundel, slain on the sands, and buried
in the Chapel; Perkin Warbeck's unfortunate wife, who took refuge at
St.And so on, and so on,
through the centuries, to the family of St.Aubyn, who bought it in
1660, and have inhabited it ever since."Very nice people," we heard
they were; who have received here the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and
other royal personages.Yet, looking up as we rowed under the gloomy rock, we could fancy his
giant ghost sitting there, on the spot where he killed his wife, for
bringing in her apron greenstone, instead of granite, to build the
chapel with.Which being really built of greenstone the story must be
true!What a pleasure it is to be able to believe anything!Some of us could have stayed out half the night, floating along in the
mild soft air and dreamy moonlight, which made even the commonplace
little town look like a fairy scene, and exalted St.Michael's Mount
into a grand fortress, fit for its centuries of legendary lore--but
others preferred going to bed.Not however without taking a long look out
of the window upon the bay, which now, at high tide, was one sheet of
rippling moon-lit water, with the grim old Mount, full of glimmering
lights like eyes, sitting silent in the midst of the silent sea.[Illustration: CORNISH FISHERMAN.]DAY THE TENTH


I cannot advise Marazion as a bathing place.What a down-come from the
picturesque vision of last night, to a small ugly fishy-smelling beach,
which seemed to form a part of the town and its business, and was
overlooked from everywhere!Yet on it two or three family groups were
evidently preparing for a dip, or rather a wade of about a quarter of a
mile in exceedingly dirty sea water."This will never do," we said to our old Norwegian."You must row us to
some quiet cove along the shore, and away from the town."He nodded his head, solemn and mute as the dumb boatman of dead Elaine,
rowed us out seaward for about half-a-mile, and then proceeded to
fasten the boat to a big stone, and walk ashore.The water still did
not come much above his knees--he seemed quite indifferent to it.Well, we could but do at Rome as the Romans do.Toilette in an open
boat was evidently the custom of the country.And the sun was warm, the
sea safe and shallow.Indeed, so rapidly did it subside, that by the
time the bath was done, we were aground, and had to call at the top of
our voices to our old man, who sat, with his back to us, dim in the
distance, on another big stone, calmly smoking the pipe of peace."We'll not try this again," was the unanimous resolve, as, after
politely declining a suggestion that "the ladies should walk ashore--"
did he think we were amphibious?--we got ourselves floated off at last,
and rowed to the nearest landing point, the entrance to St.Probably nowhere in England is found the like of this place.Such
a curious mingling of a mediaeval fortress and modern residence; of
antiquarian treasures and everyday business; for at the foot of the
rock is a fishing village of about thirty cottages, which carries
on a thriving trade; and here also is a sort of station for the tiny
underground-railway, which worked by a continuous chain, fulfils the
very necessary purpose (failing Giant Cormoran, and wife) of carrying
up coals, provisions, luggage, and all other domestic necessaries to
the hill top.Thither we climbed by a good many weary steps, and thought, delightful
as it may be to dwell on the top of a rock in the midst of the sea,
like eagles in an eyrie, there are certain advantages in living on a
level country road, or even in a town street.Aubyns manage when they go out to dinner?Two years afterwards,
when I read in the paper that one of the daughters of the house,
leaning over the battlements, had lost her balance and fallen down,
mercifully unhurt, to the rocky <DW72> below--the very spot where we
to-day sat so quietly gazing out on the lovely sea view--I felt with
a shudder that on the whole, it would be a trying thing to bring up a
young family on St.Still, generation after generation of honourable St.Aubyns have
brought up their families there, and oh!How fresh, and yet mild blew the soft sea-wind outside of it, and
inside, what endless treasures there were for the archaeological mind!The chapel alone was worth a morning's study, even though shown--odd
anachronism--by a footman in livery, who pointed out with great gusto
the entrance to a vault discovered during the last repairs, where was
found the skeleton of a large man--his bones only--no clue whatever as
to who he was or when imprisoned there.The "Jeames" of modern days
told us this tale with a noble indifference.Nothing of the kind was
likely to happen to him.Further still we were fortunate enough to penetrate, and saw the Chevy
Chase Hall, with its cornice of hunting scenes, the drawing-room, the
school-room--only fancy learning lessons there, amidst the veritable
evidence of the history one was studying!And perhaps the prettiest bit
of it all was our young guide, herself a St.Aubyn, with her simple
grace and sweet courtesy, worthy of one of the fair ladies worshipped
by King Arthur's knights.[Illustration: THE SEINE BOAT--A PERILOUS MOMENT.]We did not like encroaching on her kindness, though we could have
stayed all day, admiring the curious things she showed us.So we
descended the rock, and crossed the causeway, now dry, but very rough
walking--certainly St.Michael's Mount has its difficulties as a modern
dwelling-house--and went back to our inn.For, having given our
horse a forenoon's rest, we planned a visit to that spot immortalised
by nursery rhyme--

  "As I was going to St.Ives
  I met a man with seven wives.Each wife had seven sacks;
  Each sack had seven cats;
  Each cat had seven kits;
  Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,--
  How many were there going to St.--One; and after we had been there, we felt sure he never went again!There were two roads, we learnt, to that immortal town; one very good,
but dull; the other bad--and beautiful.We chose the latter, and never
repented.Nor, in passing through Penzance, did we repent not having taken up our
quarters there.It was pretty, but so terribly "genteel," so extremely
civilised.Glancing up at the grand hotel, we thought with pleasure of
our old-fashioned inn at Marazion, where the benign waiter took quite
a fatherly interest in our proceedings, even to giving us for dinner
our very own blackberries, gathered yesterday on the road, and politely
hindering another guest from helping himself to half a dishful, as
"they belonged to the young ladies."Truly, there are better things in
life than fashionable hotels.But the neighbourhood of Penzance is lovely.Shrubs and flowers such
as one sees on the shores of the Mediterranean grew and flourished in
cottage-gardens, and the forest trees we drove under, whole avenues
of them, were very fine; gentlemen's seats appeared here and there,
surrounded with the richest vegetation, and commanding lovely views.As
the road gradually mounted upwards, we saw, clear as in a panorama, the
whole coast from the Lizard Point to the Land's End,--which we should
behold to-morrow.For, hearing that every week-day about a hundred tourists in carriages,
carts, and omnibuses, usually flocked thither, we decided that the
desire of our lives, the goal of our pilgrimage, should be visited
by us on a Sunday.We thought that to drive us thither in solitary
Sabbatic peace would be fully as good for Charles's mind and morals as
to hang all day idle about Marazion; and he seemed to think so himself.Therefore, in prospect of to-morrow, he dealt very tenderly with his
horse to-day, and turned us out to walk up the heaviest hills, of which
there were several, between Penzance and Castle-an-Dinas."There it is," he said at last, stopping in the midst of a wide moor
and pointing to a small building, sharp against the sky."The carriage
can't get further, but you can go on, ladies, and I'll stop and gather
some blackberries for you."For brambles, gorse bushes, and clumps of fading heather, with one or
two small stunted trees, were now the only curiosities of this, King
Arthur's famed hunting castle, and hunting ground, which spread before
us for miles and miles.Passing a small farm-house, we made our way to
the building Charles pointed out, standing on the highest ridge of the
promontory, whose furthest point is the Land's End.Standing there, we
could see--or could have seen but that the afternoon had turned grey
and slightly misty--the ocean on both sides.Inland, the view seemed
endless.Roughtor and Brown Willy, two Dartmoor hills, are said to be
visible sometimes.Nearer, little white dots of houses show the mining
districts of Redruth and Camborne.A single wayfarer, looking like a
working man in his Sunday best going to visit friends, but evidently
tired, as if he had walked for miles, just glanced at us, and passed
on.We stood, all alone, on the very spot where many a time must have
stood King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, Sir Launcelot, and the other
knights--or the real human beings, whether barbarian or not, who formed
the originals of those mythical personages.Nothing was left but a common-place little tower,
built up of the fragments of the old castle, and a wide, pathless
moor, over which the wind sighed, and the mist crept.No memorial
whatever of King Arthur, except the tradition--which time and change
have been powerless to annihilate--that such a man once existed.The
long vitality which the legend keeps proves that he must have been
a remarkable man in his day.Romance itself cannot exist without a
foundation in reality.So I preached to my incredulous juniors, who threw overboard King
Arthur and took to blackberry-gathering; and to conversation with a
most comely Cornishwoman, milking the prettiest of Cornish cows in the
lonely farm-yard, which was the only sign of humanity for miles and
miles.We admired herself and her cattle; we drank her milk, offering
for it the usual payment.But the picturesque milkmaid shook her head
and demanded just double what even the dearest of London milk-sellers
would have asked for the quantity.Which sum we paid in silence,
and I only record the fact here in order to state that spite of our
foreboding railway friend at Falmouth, this was the only instance in
which we were ever "taken in," or in the smallest degree imposed upon,
in Cornwall.Another hour, slowly driving down the gradual <DW72> of the country,
through a mining district much more cheerful than that beyond Marazion.The mines were all apparently in full work, and the mining villages
were pretty, tidy, and cosy-looking, even picturesque.Ives the houses had quite a foreign look, but when we descended to
the town, its dark, narrow streets, pervaded by a "most ancient and
fish-like smell," were anything but attractive.As was our hotel, where, as a matter of duty, we ordered tea, but
doubted if we should enjoy it, and went out again to see what little
there seemed to be seen, puzzling our way through the gloomy and not
too fragrant streets, till at last in despair we stopped a bland,
elderly, Methodist-minister-looking gentleman, and asked him the way to
the sea."You're strangers here, ma'am?"I owned the humbling fact, as the inhabitant of St."And is it the pilchard fishery you want to see?A few pilchards have been seen already.There are the boats, the
fishermen are all getting ready.It's a fine sight to see them start.Would you like to come and look at them?"He had turned back and was walking with us down the street, pointing
out everything that occurred to him as noticeable, in the kindest and
civilest way.When we apologised for troubling him, and would have
parted company, our friend made no attempt to go."Oh, I've nothing at all to do, except"--he took out the biggest and
most respectable of watches--"except to attend a prayer-meeting at
half-past six.I should have time to show you the town; we think it is
a very nice little town.I ought to know it; I've lived in it, boy and
man for thirty-seven years.But now I have left my business to my sons,
and I just go about and amuse myself, looking into the shop now and
then just for curiosity.You must have seen my old shop, ladies, if you
came down that street."Which he named, and also gave us his own name, which we had seen over
the shop door, but I shall not record either.Not that I think the
honest man is ever likely to read such "light" literature as this book,
or to recall the three wanderers to whom he was so civil and kind, and
upon whom he poured out an amount of local and personal facts, which
we listened to--as a student of human nature is prone to do--with an
amused interest in which the comic verged on the pathetic.How large
to each man seems his own little world, and what child-like faith he
has in its importance to other people!I shall always recall our friend
at St.Ives, with his prayer-meetings, his chapel-goings--I concluded
he was a Methodist, a sect very numerous in Cornwall--his delight in
his successful shop and well-brought-up sons, who managed it so well,
leaving him to enjoy his _otium cum dignitate_--no doubt a municipal
dignity, for he showed us the Town Hall with great gusto.Evidently to
his honest, simple soul, St.By and by again he pulled out the turnip-like watch."Just ten minutes
to get to my prayer-meeting, and I never like to be late, I have been a
punctual man all my life, ma'am," added he, half apologetically, till
I suggested that this was probably the cause of his peace and success.Upon which he smiled, lifted his hat with a benign adieu, hoped we had
liked St.Ives--we had liked his company at any rate--and with a final
pointing across the street, "There's my shop, ladies, if you would care
to look at it," trotted away to his prayer-meeting.Ives, especially Tregenna, its
ancient mansion transformed into an hotel, is exceedingly pretty, but
night was falling fast, and we saw nothing.Speedily we despatched a
most untempting meal, and hurried Charles's departure, lest we should
be benighted, as we nearly were, during the long miles of straight and
unlovely road--the good road--between here and Penzance.We had done
our duty, we had seen the place, but as, in leaving it behind us, we
laughingly repeated the nursery rhyme, we came to the conclusion that
the man who was "_going_ to St.Ives" was the least fortunate of all
those notable individuals.DAY THE ELEVENTH


The last thing before retiring, we had glanced out on a gloomy sea, a
starless sky, pitch darkness, broken only by those moving lights on St.Michael's Mount, and thought anxiously of the morrow.It would be hard,
if after journeying thus far and looking forward to it so many years,
the day on which we went to the Land's End should turn out a wet day!Still "hope on, hope ever," as we used to write in our copy-books.Some
of us, I think, still go on writing it in empty air, and will do so
till the hand is dust.It was with a feeling almost of solemnity that we woke and looked out
on the dawn, grey and misty, but still not wet.To be just on the point
of gaining the wish of a life-time, however small, is a fact rare
enough to have a certain pathos in it.We slept again, and trusted
for the best, which by breakfast-time really came, in flickering
sun-gleams, and bits of hopeful blue sky.We wondered for the last
time, as we had wondered for half a century, "what the Land's End would
be like," and then started, rather thoughtful than merry, to find out
the truth of the case.Glad as we were to have for our expedition this quiet Sunday instead
of a tumultuous week day, conscience smote us in driving through
Penzance, with the church-bells ringing, and the people streaming along
to morning service, all in their Sunday best.Perhaps we might manage
to go to afternoon church at Sennen, or St.Sennen's, which we knew
by report, as the long-deceased father of a family we were acquainted
with had been curate there early in the century, and we had promised
faithfully "just to go and look at the old place."But one can keep Sunday sometimes even outside church-doors.I shall
never forget the Sabbatic peace of that day; those lonely and lovely
roads, first rich with the big trees and plentiful vegetation about
Penzance, then gradually growing barer and barer as we drove along the
high promontory which forms the extreme point westward of our island.The way along which so many tourist-laden vehicles pass daily was
now all solitary; we scarcely saw a soul, except perhaps a labourer
leaning over a gate in his decent Sunday clothes, or two or three
children trotting to school or church, with their books under their
arms.Unquestionably Cornwall is a respectable, sober-minded county;
religious-minded too, whether Methodist, Quaker, or other nonconformist
sects, of which there are a good many, or decent, conservative Church
of England.Buryan's--a curious old church founded on the place where
an Irishwoman, Saint Buriana, is said to have made her hermitage.A
few stray cottages comprised the whole village.There was nothing
special to see, except to drink in the general atmosphere of peace and
sunshine and solitude, till we came to Treryn, the nearest point to the
celebrated Logan or rocking-stone.From childhood we had read about it; the most remarkable specimen in
England of those very remarkable stones, whether natural or artificial,
who can decide?"Which the touch of a finger alone sets moving,
  But all earth's powers cannot shake from their base."Not quite true, this; since in 1824 a rash and foolish Lieutenant
Goldsmith (let his name be gibbeted for ever!)did come with a boat's
crew, and by main force remove the Logan a few inches from the point
on which it rests.Indignant justice very properly compelled him, at
great labour and pains, to put it back again, but it has never rocked
properly since.By Charles's advice we took a guide, a solemn-looking youth, who
stalked silently ahead of us along the "hedges," which, as at the
Lizard, furnished the regular path across the fields coastwards.Soon the gleaming circle of sea again flashed upon us, from behind a
labyrinth of rocks, whence we met a couple of tourists returning."You'll find it a pretty stiff climb to the Logan, ladies," said one of
them in answer to a question.And so we should have done, indeed, had not our guide's hand been
much readier than his tongue.I, at least, should never have got even
so far as that little rock-nest where I located myself--a somewhat
anxious-minded old hen--and watched my chickens climb triumphantly that
enormous mass of stone which we understood to be the Logan.they shouted across the dead stillness, the
lovely solitude of sky and sea.And I suppose it did rock, but must
honestly confess _I_ could not see it stir a single inch.However, it was a big stone, a very big stone, and the stones
around it were equally huge and most picturesquely thrown together.Also--delightful to my young folks!--they furnished the most
adventurous scramble that heart could desire.I alone felt a certain
relief when we were all again on smooth ground, with no legs or arms
broken.The cliff-walk between the Logan and the Land's End is said to be one
of the finest in England for coast scenery.Treryn or Treen Dinas,
Pardeneck Point, and Tol Pedn Penwith had been named as places we ought
to see, but this was impracticable.We had to content ourselves with a
dull inland road, across a country gradually getting more barren and
ugly, till we found ourselves suddenly at what seemed the back-yard of
a village public-house, where two or three lounging stable-men came
forward to the carriage, and Charles jumped down from his box.I forbear to translate the world of meaning implied in that brief
exclamation.Perhaps we shall admire the place more
when we have ceased to be hungry."The words of wisdom were listened to; and we spent our first quarter of
an hour at the Land's End in attacking a skeleton "remain" of not too
daintily-cooked beef, and a cavernous cheese, in a tiny back parlour
of the--let me give it its right name--First and Last Inn, of Great
Britain."We never provide for Sunday," said the waitress, responding to a
sympathetic question on the difficulty it must be to get food here."It's very seldom any tourists come on a Sunday."At which we felt altogether humbled; but in a few minutes more our
contrition passed into sovereign content.We went out of doors, upon the narrow green plateau in front of the
house, and then we recognised where we were--standing at the extreme
end of a peninsula, with a long line of rocks running out still further
into the sea.That "great and wide sea, wherein are moving things
innumerable," the mysterious sea "kept in the hollow of His hand," who
is Infinity, and looking at which, in the intense solitude and silence,
one seems dimly to guess at what Infinity may be.Any one who wishes to
go to church for once in the Great Temple which His hands have builded,
should spend a Sunday at the Land's End.At first, our thought had been, What in the world shall we do here for
two mortal hours!Now, we wished we had had two whole days.A sunset, a
sunrise, a star-lit night, what would they not have been in this grand
lonely place--almost as lonely as a ship at sea?It would be next best
to finding ourselves in the middle of the Atlantic.But this bliss could not be; so we proceeded to make the best of what
we had.The bright day was darkening, and a soft greyness began to
creep over land and sea.No, not soft, that is the very last adjective
applicable to the Land's End.Even on that calm day there was a fresh
wind--there must be always wind--and the air felt sharper and more salt
than any sea-air I ever knew.Stimulating too, so that one's nerves
were strung to the highest pitch of excitement.We felt able to do
anything, without fear and without fatigue.So that when a guide came
forward--a regular man-of-war's-man he looked--we at once resolved to
adventure along the line of rocks, seaward, "out as far as anybody was
accustomed to go.""Ay, ay; I'll take you, ladies.That is--the young ladies might go--but
you--" eying me over with his keen sailor's glance, full of honesty and
good humour, "you're pretty well on in years, ma'am."Laughing, I told him how far on, but that I was able to do a good deal
yet."Oh, I've taken ladies much older than you.One the other day was
nearly seventy.So we'll do our best, ma'am.He offered a rugged, brown hand, as firm and steady as a mast, to hold
by, and nothing could exceed the care and kindliness with which he
guided every step of every one of us, along that perilous path, that
is, perilous except for cautious feet and steady heads.If you make one false step, you are done
for," said our guide, composedly as he pointed to the boiling whirl of
waters below.[Illustration: THE LAND'S END AND THE LOGAN ROCK.]Still, though a narrow and giddy path, there was a path, and the
exploit, though a little risky, was not fool-hardy.We should have
been bitterly sorry not to have done it--not to have stood for one
grand ten minutes, where in all our lives we may never stand again, at
the farthest point where footing is possible, gazing out upon that
magnificent circle of sea which sweeps over the submerged "land of
Lyonesse," far, far away, into the wide Atlantic.There were just two people standing with us, clergymen evidently, and
one, the guide told us, was "the parson at St.We spoke to
him, as people do speak, instinctively, when mutually watching such a
scene, and by and by we mentioned the name of the long-dead curate of
St.The "parson" caught instantly at the name.Oh, yes, my father knew him quite well.He used constantly
to walk across from Sennen to our house, and take us children long
rambles across the cliffs, with a volume of Southey or Wordsworth under
his arm.He was a fine young fellow in those days, I have heard, and an
excellent clergyman.And he afterwards married a very nice girl from
the north somewhere."The "nice girl" was now a sweet silver-haired little
lady of nearly eighty; the "fine young fellow" had long since departed;
and the boy was this grave middle-aged gentleman, who remembered both
as a tradition of his youth.What a sermon it all preached, beside this
eternal rock, this ever-moving, never-changing sea!But time was passing--how fast it does pass, minutes, ay, and years!We
bade adieu to our known unknown friend, and turned our feet backwards,
cautiously as ever, stopping at intervals to listen to the gossip of
our guide."Yes, ladies, that's the spot--you may see the hoof-mark--where General
Armstrong's horse fell over; he just slipped off in time, but the poor
beast was drowned.And here, over that rock, happened the most curious
thing.I wouldn't have believed it myself, only I knew a man that saw
it with his own eyes.Once a bullock fell off into the pool below
there--just look, ladies."(We did look, into a perfect Maelstrom of
boiling waves.)"Everybody thought he was drowned, till he was seen
swimming about unhurt.They fished him up, and exhibited him as a
curiosity."And again, pointing to a rock far out in the sea.Thirty years ago a ship went to pieces there, and
the captain and his wife managed to climb on to that rock.They held
on there for two days and a night, before a boat could get at them.At last they were taken off one at a time, with rockets and a rope;
the wife first.But the rope slipped and she fell into the water.She
was pulled out in a minute or so, and rowed ashore, but they durst
not tell her husband she was drowned.I was standing on the beach at
Whitesand Bay when the boat came in.I was only a lad, but I remember
it well, and her too lifted out all dripping and quite dead."They went back for him, and got him off safe, telling him nothing.But
when he found she was dead he went crazy-like--kept for ever saying,
'She saved my life, she saved my life,' till he was taken away by his
friends.Look out, ma'am, mind your footing; just here a lady slipped
and broke her leg a week ago.I had to carry her all the way to the
hotel.We all smiled at the comical candour of the honest sailor, who
proceeded to give us bits of his autobiography.He was Cornish born,
but had seen a deal of the world as an A.B.on board her Majesty's ship
_Agamemnon_."Of course you have heard of the _Agamemnon_, ma'am.I was in her off
Balaklava.His eyes brightened as we discussed names and places once
so familiar, belonging to that time, which now seems so far back as to
be almost historical."Then you know what a winter we had, and what a summer afterwards.I
came home invalided, and didn't attempt the service afterwards; but I
never thought I should come home at all.Yes, it's a fine place the
Land's End, though the air is so strong that it kills some folks right
off.Once an invalid gentleman came, and he was dead in a fortnight.But I'm not dead yet, and I stop here mostly all the year round."He sniffed the salt air and smiled all over his weather-beaten
face--keen, bronzed, blue-eyed, like one of the old Vikings.He was a
fine specimen of a true British tar.When, having seen all we could, we
gave him his small honorarium, he accepted it gratefully, and insisted
on our taking in return a memento of the place in the shape of a stone
weighing about two pounds, glittering with ore, and doubtless valuable,
but ponderous.Oh, the trouble it gave me to carry it home, and pack
and unpack it among my small luggage!But I did bring it home, and
I keep it still in remembrance of the Land's End, and of the honest
sailor of H.M.S.We could dream of an unknown Land's End no more.It
became now a real place, of which the reality, though different from
the imagination, was at least no disappointment.How few people in
attaining a life-long desire can say as much!Our only regret, an endurable one now, was that we had not carried out
our original plan of staying some days there--tourist-haunted, troubled
days they might have been, but the evenings and mornings would have
been glorious.With somewhat heavy hearts we summoned Charles and the
carriage, for already a misty drift of rain began sweeping over the sea."Still, we must see Whitesand Bay," said one of us, recalling a story
a friend had once told how, staying at Land's End, she crossed the bay
alone in a blinding storm, took refuge at the coastguard station, where
she was hospitably received, and piloted back with most chivalric care
by a coastguard, who did not tell her till their journey's end that he
had left at home a wife, and a baby just an hour old.We only caught a glimmer of the
bay through drizzling rain, which by the time we reached Sennen village
had become a regular downpour.Evidently, we could do no more that day,
which was fast melting into night."We'll go home," was the sad resolve, glad nevertheless that we had a
comfortable "home" to go to.So closing the carriage and protecting ourselves as well as we could
from the driving rain, we went forward, passing the Quakers' burial
ground, where is said to be one of the finest views in Cornwall; the
Nine Maidens, a circle of Druidical stones, and many other interesting
things, without once looking at or thinking of them.Half a mile from Marazion the rain ceased, and a light like that of the
rising moon began to break through the clouds.What a night it might
be, or might have been, could we have stayed at the Land's End!It is in great things as in small, the
worry, the torment, the paralysing burden of life.We
have done our best to be happy, and we have been happy.DAY THE TWELFTH


Monday morning.Black Monday we were half inclined to call it, knowing
that by the week's end our travels must be over and done, and that if
we wished still to see all we had planned, we must inevitably next
morning return to civilisation and railways, a determination which
involved taking this night "a long, a last farewell" of our comfortable
carriage and our faithful Charles."But it needn't be until night," said he, evidently loth to part from
his ladies."If I get back to Falmouth by daylight to-morrow morning,
master will be quite satisfied.I can take you wherever you like
to-day.""Oh, he shall get a good feed and a rest till the middle of the night,
then he'll do well enough.We shall have the old moon after one o'clock
to get home by.Between Penzance and Falmouth it's a good road, though
rather lonely."I should think it was, in the "wee hours" by the dim light of a waning
moon.But Charles seemed to care nothing about it, so we said no more,
but decided to take the drive--our last drive.Our minds were perplexed between Botallack Mine, the Gurnard's Head,
Lamorna Cove, and several other places, which we were told we must on
no account miss seeing, the first especially.Some of us, blessed with
scientific relatives, almost dreaded returning home without having seen
a single Cornish mine; others, lovers of scenery, longed for more of
that magnificent coast.But finally, a meek little voice carried the
day.[Illustration: SENNEN COVE."I was so disappointed--more than I liked to say--when it rained,
and I couldn't get my shells for our bazaar.If it wouldn't trouble anybody very much, mightn't we go again to
Whitesand Bay?"It was a heavenly day; to spend it
in delicious idleness on that wide sweep of sunshiny sand would be a
rest for the next day's fatigue.there
would be no temptation to put on miners' clothes, and go dangling in
a basket down to the heart of the earth, as the Princess of Wales was
reported to have done.The pursuit of knowledge may be delightful, but
some of us owned to a secret preference for _terra firma_ and the upper
air.We resolved to face opprobrium, and declare boldly we had "no
time" (needless to add no inclination) to go and see Botallack Mine.The Gurnard's Head cost us a pang to miss; but then we should catch a
second view of the Land's End.Yes, we would go to Whitesand Bay.It was a far shorter journey in sunshine than in rain, even though we
made various divergencies for blackberries and other pleasures.Never
had the sky looked bluer or the sea brighter, and much we wished that
we could have wandered on in dreamy peace, day after day, or even gone
through England, gipsy-fashion, in a house upon wheels, which always
seemed to me the very ideal of travelling.Pretty little Sennen, with its ancient
church and its new school house, where the civil schoolmaster gave me
some ink to write a post-card for those to whom even the post-mark
"Sennen" would have a touching interest, and where the boys and girls,
released for dinner, were running about.Board school pupils, no doubt,
weighted with an amount of learning which would have been appalling
to their grandfathers and grandmothers, the simple parishioners of
the "fine young fellow" half a century ago.As we passed through the
village with its pretty cottages and "Lodgings to Let," we could not
help thinking what a delightful holiday resort this would be for
a large small family, who could be turned out as we were when the
carriage could no farther go, on the wide sweep of green common,
gradually melting into silvery sand, so fine and soft that it was
almost a pleasure to tumble down the <DW72>s, and get up again, shaking
yourself like a dog, without any sense of dirt or discomfort.What a
paradise for children, who might burrow like rabbits and wriggle about
like sand-eels, and never come to any harm!Without thought of any danger, we began selecting our bathing-place,
shallow enough, with long strips of wet shimmering sand to be crossed
before reaching even the tiniest waves; when one of us, the cautious
one, appealed to an old woman, the only human being in sight."Folks ne'er bathe here.Whether she understood us or not, or whether we
quite understood her, I am not sure, and should be sorry to libel such
a splendid bathing ground--apparently.But maternal wisdom interposed,
and the girls yielded.When, half an hour afterwards, we saw a solitary
figure moving on a distant ledge of rock, and a black dot, doubtless
a human head, swimming or bobbing about in the sea beneath--maternal
wisdom was reproached as arrant cowardice.But the sand was delicious,
the sea-wind so fresh, and the sea so bright, that disappointment could
not last.We made an encampment of our various impedimenta, stretched
ourselves out, and began the search for shells, in which every
arm's-length involved a mine of wealth and beauty.Never except at one place, on the estuary of the Mersey, have I
seen a beach made up of shells so lovely in colour and shape; very
minute; some being no bigger than a grain of rice or a pin's head.The
collecting of them was a fascination.We forgot all the historical
interests that ought to have moved us, saw neither Athelstan, King
Stephen, King John, nor Perkin Warbeck, each of whom is said to have
landed here--what were they to a tiny shell, like that moralised over
by Tennyson in "Maud"--"small, but a work divine"?I think infinite
greatness sometimes touches one less than infinite littleness--the
exceeding tenderness of Nature, or the Spirit which is behind Nature,
who can fashion with equal perfectness a starry hemisphere and a
glow-worm; an ocean and a little pink shell.The only imperfection in
creation seems--oh, strange mystery!--to be man.But away with moralising, or dreaming, though this was just a day for
dreaming, clear, bright, warm, with not a sound except the murmur
of the low waves, running in an enormous length--curling over and
breaking on the soft sands.Everything was so heavenly calm, it seemed
impossible to believe in that terrible scene when the captain and his
wife were seen clinging to the Brisons rock, just ahead.Doubtless our friend of the _Agamemnon_ was telling this and all
his other stories to an admiring circle of tourists, for we saw the
Land's End covered with a moving swarm like black flies.How thankful
we felt that we had "done" it on a Sunday!Still, we were pleased
to have another gaze at it, with its line of picturesque rocks, the
Armed Knight and the Irish Lady--though, I confess, I never could make
out which was the knight and which was the lady.Can it be that some
fragment of the legend of Tristram and Iseult originated these names?After several sweet lazy hours, we went through a "fish-cellar," a
little group of cottages, and climbed a headland, to take our veritable
farewell of the Land's End, and then decided to go home.We had rolled
or thrown our provision basket, rugs, &c., down the sandy <DW72>, but it
was another thing to carry them up again.I went in quest of a small
boy, and there presented himself a big man, coastguard, as the only
unemployed hand in the place, who apologised with such a magnificent
air for not having "cleaned" himself, that I almost blushed to ask
him to do such a menial service as to carry a bundle of wraps.But
he accepted it, conversing amiably as we went, and giving me a most
graphic picture of life at Sennen during the winter.When he left me,
making a short cut to our encampment--a black dot on the sands, with
two moving black dots near it--a fisher wife joined me, and of her own
accord began a conversation.She and I fraternised at once, chiefly on the subject of children, a
group of whom were descending the road from Sennen School.She told me
how many of them were hers, and what prizes they had gained, and what
hard work it was.She could neither read nor write, she said, but she
liked her children to be good scholars, and they learnt a deal up at
Sennen.Apparently they did, and something else besides learning, for when I
had parted from my loquacious friend, I came up to the group just in
time to prevent a stand-up fight between two small mites, the _casus
belli_ of which I could no more arrive at, than a great many wiser
people can discover the origin of national wars.So I thought the
strong hand of "intervention"--civilised intervention--was best, and
put an end to it, administering first a good scolding, and then a coin.The division of this coin among the little party compelled an extempore
sum in arithmetic, which I required them to do (for the excellent
reason that I couldn't do it myself!)Therefore I
conclude that the heads of the Sennen school-children are as solid as
their fists, and equally good for use.[Illustration: ON THE ROAD TO ST.which as the fisher wife told me, only goes to
Penzance about once a year, and is, as yet, innocent of tourists, for
the swarm at the Land's End seldom goes near Whitesand Bay.Existence
here must be very much that of an oyster,--but perhaps oysters are
happy.By the time we reached Penzance the lovely day was dying into an
equally lovely evening.It was high water, the bay was all alive with boats, and there was
quite a little crowd of people gathered at the mild little station of
Marazion.A princess was expected, that young half-English, half-foreign
princess, in whose romantic story the British public has taken such an
interest, sympathising with the motherly kindness of our good Queen,
with the wedding at Windsor, and the sad little infant funeral there,
a year after.The Princess Frederica of Hanover, and the Baron Von
Pawel-Rammingen, her father's secretary, who, like a stout mediaeval
knight, had loved, wooed, and married her, were coming to St.Michael's
Mount on a visit to the St.Marazion had evidently roused itself, and risen to the occasion.Half
the town must have turned out to the beach, and the other half secured
every available boat, in which it followed, at respectful distance,
the two boats, one full of luggage, the other of human beings, which
were supposed to be the royal party.People speculated with earnest
curiosity, which was the princess, and which her husband, and what the
St.Aubyns would do with them; whether they would be taken to see the
Land's End, and whether they would go there as ordinary tourists, or in
a grand visit of state.How hard it is that royal folk can never see
anything except in state, or in a certain adventitious garb, beautiful,
no doubt, but satisfactorily hiding the real thing.How they must long
sometimes for a walk, after the fashion of Haroun Alraschid, up and
down Regent Street and Oxford Street!or an incognito foreign tour, or
even a solitary country walk, without a "lady-in-waiting."We had no opera-glass to add to the many levelled at those two boats,
so we went in--hoping host and guests would spend a pleasant evening in
the lovely old rooms we knew.We spent ours in rest, and in arranging
for to-morrow's flight.Also in consulting with our kindly landlady
as to a possible house at Marazion for some friends whom the winter
might drive southwards, like the swallows, to a climate which, in this
one little bay shut out from east and north, is--they told us--during
all the cruel months which to many of us means only enduring life, not
living--as mild and equable almost as the Mediterranean shores.And
finally, we settled all with our faithful Charles, who looked quite
mournful at parting with his ladies."Yes, it is rather a long drive, and pretty lonely," said he."But I'll
wait till the moons up, and that'll help us.We'll get into Falmouth
by daylight.I've got to do the same thing often enough through the
summer, so I don't mind it."Thus said the good fellow, putting a cheery face on it, then with a
hasty "Good-bye, ladies," he rushed away.But we had taken his address,
not meaning to lose sight of him.(Nor have we done so up to this date
of writing; and the fidelity has been equal on both sides.)Then, in the midst of a peal of bells which was kept up unweariedly
till 10 P.M.--evidently Marazion is not blessed with the sight
of a princess every day--we closed our eyes upon all outward things,
and went away to the Land of Nod.DAY THE THIRTEENTH


Into King Arthurs land--Tintagel his birth-place, and Camelford,
where he fought his last battle--the legendary region of which one
may believe as much or as little as one pleases--we were going
to-day.With the good common sense which we flattered ourselves had
accompanied every step of our unsentimental journey, we had arranged
all before-hand, ordered a carriage to meet the mail train, and hoped
to find at Tintagel--not King Uther Pendragon, King Arthur or King
Mark, but a highly respectable landlord, who promised us a welcome at
an inn--which we only trusted would be as warm and as kindly as that we
left behind us at Marazion.The line of railway which goes to the far west of England is one of the
prettiest in the kingdom on a fine day, which we were again blessed
with.It had been a wet summer, we heard, throughout Cornwall, but
in all our journey, save that one wild storm at the Lizard, sunshine
scarcely ever failed us.Ives
Bay or sweeping through the mining district of Redruth, and the wooded
country near Truro, Grampound, and St.Austell, till we again saw the
glittering sea on the other side of Cornwall--all was brightness.Then
darting inland once more, our iron horse carried us past Lostwithiel,
the little town which once boasted Joseph Addison, M.P., as its
representative; gave us a fleeting vision of Ristormel, one of the
ancient castles of Cornwall, and on through a leafy land, beginning to
change from rich green to the still richer yellows and reds of autumn,
till we stopped at Bodmin Road.No difficulty in finding our carriage, for it was the only one there;
a huge vehicle, of ancient build, the horses to match, capable of
accommodating a whole family and its luggage.We missed our compact
little machine, and our brisk, kindly Charles, but soon settled
ourselves in dignified, roomy state, for the twenty miles, or rather
more, which lay between us and the coast.Our way ran along lonely
quiet country roads and woods almost as green as when Queen Guinevere
rode through them "a maying," before the dark days of her sin and King
Arthur's death.Here it occurs to me, as it did this day to a practical youthful mind,
"What in the world do people know about King Arthur?"Well, most people have read Tennyson, and a few are acquainted with
the "Morte d'Arthur" of Sir Thomas Malory.But, perhaps I had better
briefly give the story, or as much of it as is necessary for the
edification of outsiders.Uther Pendragon, King of Britain, falling in love with Ygrayne, wife of
the duke of Cornwall, besieged them in their twin castles of Tintagel
and Terrabil, slew the husband, and the same day married the wife.Unto
whom a boy was born, and by advice of the enchanter Merlin, carried
away, from the sea-shore beneath Tintagel, and confided to a good
knight, Sir Ector, to be brought up as his own son, and christened
Arthur.On the death of the king, Merlin produced the youth, who was
recognized by his mother Ygrayne, and proclaimed king in the stead
of Uther Pendragon.He instituted the Order of Knights of the Round
Table, who were to go everywhere, punishing vice and rescuing oppressed
virtue, for the love of God and of some noble lady.He married
Guinevere, daughter of King Leodegrance, who forsook him for the love
of Sir Launcelot, his bravest knight and dearest friend.One by one,
his best knights fell away into sin, and his nephew Mordred raised a
rebellion, fought with him, and conquered him at Camelford.Seeing his
end was near, Arthur bade his last faithful knight, Sir Bedevere, carry
him to the shore of a mere (supposed to be Dozmare Pool) and throw in
there his sword Excalibur; when appeared a boat with three queens,
who lifted him in, mourning over him.With them he sailed away across
the mere, to be healed of his grievous wound.Some say that he was
afterwards buried in a chapel near, others declare that he lives still
in fairy land, and will reappear in latter days, to reinstate the Order
of Knights of the Round Table, and rule his beloved England, which will
then be perfect as he once tried to make it, but in vain.Camelford of to-day is certainly not the Camelot of King Arthur--but
a very respectable, commonplace little town, much like other country
towns; the same genteel linendrapers' and un-genteel ironmongers'
shops; the same old-established commercial inn, and a few ugly, but
solid-looking private houses, with their faces to the street and
their backs nestled in gardens and fields.Some of the inhabitants of
these said houses were to be seen taking a quiet afternoon stroll.Doubtless they are eminently respectable and worthy folk, leading a
mild provincial life like the people in Miss Martineau's _Deerbrook_,
or Miss Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_--of which latter quality they
have probably a good share.We let our horses rest, but we ourselves felt not the slightest wish to
rest at Camelford, so walked leisurely on till we came to the little
river Camel, and to Slaughter Bridge, said to be the point where King
Arthur's army was routed and where he received his death-wound.A
slab of stone, some little distance up the stream, is still called
"King Arthur's Tomb."But as his coffin is preserved, as well as his
Round Table, at Winchester; where, according to mediaeval tradition,
the bodies of both Arthur and Guinevere were found, and the head
of Guinevere had yellow hair; also that near the little village of
Davidstow, is a long barrow, having in the centre a mound, which is
called "King Arthur's grave"--inquiring minds have plenty of "facts" to
choose from.Possibly at last they had better resort to fiction, and
believe in Arthur's disappearance, as Tennyson makes him say,

  "To the island-valley of Avillion...
  Where I may heal me of my grievous wound."Dozmare Pool we found so far out of our route that we had to make a
virtue of necessity, and imagine it all; the melancholy moorland lake,
with the bleak hill above it, and stray glimpses of the sea beyond.A ghostly spot, and full of many ghostly stories besides the legend
of Arthur.Here Tregeagle, the great demon of Cornwall, once had his
dwelling, until, selling his soul to the devil, his home was sunk to
the bottom of the mere, and himself is heard of stormy nights, wailing
round it with other ghost-demons, in which the Cornish mind still
lingeringly believes.Visionary packs of hounds; a shadowy coach and
horses, which drives round and round the pool, and then drives into it;
flitting lights, kindled by no human hand, in places where no human
foot could go--all these tales are still told by the country folk, and
we might have heard them all.Might also have seen, in fancy, the flash
of the "brand Excalibur"; heard the wailing song of the three queens;
and pictured the dying Arthur lying on the lap of his sister Morgane la
Faye.But, I forgot, this is an un-sentimental journey.The Delabole quarries are as un-sentimental a place as one could
desire.It was very curious to come suddenly upon this world of slate,
piled up in enormous masses on either side the road, and beyond them
hills of debris, centuries old--for the mines have been worked ever
since the time of Queen Elizabeth.Houses, walls, gates, fences,
everything that can possibly be made of slate, is made.No green or
other colour tempers the all-pervading shade of bluish-grey, for
vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the quarries is abolished,
the result of which would be rather dreary, save for the cheerful
atmosphere of wholesome labour, the noise of waggons, horses,
steam-engines--such a contrast to the silence of the deserted tin-mines.But, these Delabole quarries passed, silence and solitude come back
again.Even the yearly-increasing influx of tourists fails to make
the little village of Trevena anything but a village, where the
said tourists lounge about in the one street, if it can be called a
street, between the two inns and the often-painted, picturesque old
post-office.Everything looked so simple, so home-like, that we were
amused to find we had to get ready for a _table d'hote_ dinner, in
the only available eating room where the one indefatigable waitress,
a comely Cornish girl, who seemed Argus and Briareus rolled into one,
served us--a party small enough to make conversation general, and
pleasant and intelligent enough to make it very agreeable, which does
not always happen at an English hotel.Then we sallied out to find the lane which leads to Tintagel Castle,
or Castles--for one sits in the sea, the other on the opposite heights
in the mainland, with power of communicating by the narrow causeway
which now at least exists between the rock and the shore.This seems to
confirm the legend, how the luckless husband of Ygrayne shut up himself
and his wife in two castles, he being slain in the one, and she married
to the victorious King Uther Pendragon, in the other.Both looked so steep and dangerous in the fast-coming twilight that we
thought it best to attempt neither, so contented ourselves with a walk
on the cliffs and the smooth green field which led thither.Leaning
against a gate, we stood and watched one of the grandest out of the
many grand sunsets which had blessed us in Cornwall.The black rock of
Tintagel filled the foreground; beyond, the eye saw nothing but sea,
the sea which covers vanished Lyonesse, until it met the sky, a clear
amber with long bars like waves, so that you could hardly tell where
sea ended and sky began.Then into it there swam slowly a long low
cloud, shaped like a boat, with a raised prow, and two or three figures
sitting at the stern."King Arthur and the three queens," we declared, and really a very
moderate imagination could have fancied it this."But what is that long
black thing at the bow?""Oh," observed drily the most practical of the three, "it's King
Arthur's luggage."We fell into fits of laughter, and
went home to tea and bed.DAYS FOURTEENTH, FIFTEENTH, AND SIXTEENTH--


And all Arthurian days, so I will condense them into one chapter, and
not spin out the hours that were flying so fast.Yet we hardly wished
to stop them; for pleasant as travelling is, the best delight of all
is--the coming home.Walking, to one more of those exquisite autumn days, warm as summer,
yet with a tender brightness that hot summer never has, like the love
between two old people, out of whom all passion has died--we remembered
that we were at Tintagel, the home of Ygrayne and Arthur, of King Mark
and Tristram and Iseult.I had to tell that story to my girls in the
briefest form, how King Mark sent his nephew, Sir Tristram, to fetch
home Iseult of Ireland for his queen, and on the voyage Bragswaine,
her handmaiden, gave each a love-potion, which caused the usual fatal
result; how at last Tristram fled from Tintagel into Brittany, where
he married another Iseult "of the white hands," and lived peacefully,
till, stricken by death, his fancy went back to his old love, whom he
implored to come to him.A tale--of which
the only redeeming point is the innocence, simplicity, and dignity of
the second Iseult, the unloved Breton wife, to whom none of our modern
poets who have sung or travestied the wild, passionate, miserable, ugly
story, have ever done full justice.These sinful lovers, the much-wronged but brutal King Mark, the
scarcely less brutal Uther Pendragon, and hapless Ygrayne--what a
curious condition of morals and manners the Arthurian legends unfold!A time when might was right; when every one seized what he wanted just
because he wanted it, and kept it, if he could, till a stronger hand
wrenched it from him.That in such a state of society there should
ever have arisen the dimmest dream of a man like Arthur--not perhaps
Tennyson's Arthur, the "blameless king," but even Sir Thomas Malory's,
founded on mere tradition--is a remarkable thing.Clear through all
the mists of ages shines that ideal of knighthood, enjoining courage,
honour, faith, chastity, the worship of God and the service of men.Also, in the very highest degree, inculcating that chivalrous love of
woman--not women--which barbaric nations never knew.As we looked at
that hoar ruin sitting solitary in the sunny sea, and thought of the
days when it was a complete fortress, inclosing a mass of human beings,
all with human joys, sorrows, passions, crimes--things that must have
existed in essence, however legend has exaggerated or altered them--we
could not but feel that the mere possibility of a King Arthur shining
down the dim vista of long-past centuries, is something to prove that
goodness, like light, has an existence as indestructible as Him from
whom it comes.We looked at Tintagel with its risky rock-path."It will be a hot
climb, and our bathing days are numbered.Let us go in the opposite
direction to Bossinney Cove."Practicality when weighed against Poetry is poor--Poetry always kicks
the beam.While waiting for
the tide to cover the little strip of sand, we re-mounted the winding
path, and settled ourselves like seabirds on the furthermost point of
rock, whence, just by extending a hand, we could have dropped anything,
ourselves even, into a sheer abyss of boiling waves, dizzy to look down
into, and yet delicious.So was the bath, though a little gloomy, for the sun could barely reach
the shut-in cove; and we were interfered with considerably by--not
tourists--but a line of donkeys!They were seen solemnly descending the
narrow cliff-path one by one--eleven in all--each with an empty sack
over his shoulder.Lastly came a very old man, who, without taking the
least notice of us, disposed himself to fill these sacks with sand.One after the other the eleven meek animals came forward and submitted
each to his load, which proceeding occupied a good hour and a half.I hardly know which was the most patient, the old man or his donkeys.[Illustration: CRESWICK'S MILL IN THE ROCKY VALLEY.]We began some of us to talk to his beasts, and others to himself."Yes,
it was hard work," he said, "but he managed to come down to the cove
three times a day.They all had their
names; Lucy, Cherry, Sammy, Tom, Jack, Ned;" each animal pricked up its
long ears and turned round its quiet eyes when called.Some were young
and some old, but all were very sure-footed, which was necessary here."The weight some of 'em would carry was wonderful."The old man seemed proud of the creatures, and kind to them too in a
sort of way.He had been a fisherman, he said, but now was too old for
that; so got his living by collecting sand."It makes capital garden-paths, this sand.I'd be glad to bring you
some, ladies," said he, evidently with an eye to business.When we
explained that this was impracticable, unless he would come all the way
to London, he merely said, "Oh," and accepted the disappointment.Then
bidding us a civil "Good day," he disappeared with his laden train.Nothing of the past knightly days, nothing of the
busy existing modern present affected him, or ever would do so.He
might have been own brother, or cousin, to Wordsworth's "Leech-gatherer
on the lonely moor."Whenever we think of Bossinney Cove, we shall
certainly think of that mild old man and his eleven donkeys.The day was hot, and it had been a steep climb; we decided to drive in
the afternoon, "for a rest," to Boscastle.Artists and tourists haunt this picturesque nook.A village built at
the end of a deep narrow creek, which runs far inland, and is a safe
shelter for vessels of considerable size.On either side is a high
footpath, leading to two headlands, from both of which the views of
sea and coast are very fine.And there are relics of antiquity and
legends thereto belonging--a green mound, all that remains of Bottrieux
Castle; and Ferrabury Church, with its silent tower.A peal of bells
had been brought, and the ship which carried them had nearly reached
the cove, when the pilot, bidding the captain "thank God for his safe
voyage," was answered that he "thanked only himself and a fair wind."Immediately a storm arose; and the ship went down with every soul on
board--except the pilot.So the church tower is mute--but on winter
nights the lost bells are still heard, sounding mournfully from the
depths of the sea.As we sat, watching with a vague fascination the spouting, minute by
minute, of a "blow-hole," almost as fine as the Kynance post-office--we
moralised on the story of the bells, and on the strange notions people
have, even in these days, of Divine punishments; imputing to the
Almighty Father all their own narrow jealousies and petty revenges,
dragging down God into the likeness of men, such an one as themselves,
instead of striving to lift man into the image of God.Meantime the young folks rambled and scrambled--watched with anxious
and even envious eyes--for it takes one years to get entirely
reconciled to the quiescence of the down-hill journey.And then we
drove slowly back--just in time for another grand sunset, with Tintagel
black in the foreground, until it and all else melted into darkness,
and there was nothing left but to

  "Watch the twilight stars come out
    Above the lonely sea."Next morning we must climb Tintagel, for it would be our last day.How softly the waves crept in upon the
beach--just as they might have done when they laid at Merlin's feet
"the little naked child," disowned of man but dear to Heaven, who was
to grow up into the "stainless king."He and his knights--the "shadowy people of the realm of dream,"--were
all about us, as, guided by a rheumatic old woman, who climbed feebly
up the stair, where generations of ghostly feet must have ascended and
descended, we reached a bastion and gateway, quite pre-historic.Other
ruins apparently belong to the eleventh or twelfth centuries.It may have been the very landing-place of King
Uther or King Mark, or other Cornish heroes, who held this wonderful
natural-artificial fortress in the dim days of old romance."Here are King Arthur's cups and saucers," said the old woman, pausing
in the midst of a long lament over her own ailments, to point out some
holes in the slate rock."And up there you'll find the chapel.It's an
easy climb--if you mind the path--just where it passes the spring."That spring, trickling down from the very top of the rock, and making
a verdant space all round it--what a treasure it must have been to the
unknown inhabitants who, centuries ago, entrenched themselves here--for
offence or defence--against the main-land.Peacefully it flowed on
still, with the little ferns growing, and the sheep nibbling beside
it.We idle tourists alone occupied that solitary height where those
long-past warlike races--one succeeding the other--lived and loved,
fought and died.The chapel--where the high altar and a little burial-ground beside it
can still be traced--is clearly much later than Arthur's time.However,
there are so few data to go upon, and the action of sea-storms destroys
so much every year, that even to the learned archaeologist, Tintagel is
a great mystery, out of which the imaginative mind may evolve almost
anything it likes.We sat a long time on the top of the rock--realising only the one
obvious fact that our eyes were gazing on precisely the same scene,
seawards and coastwards, that all these long-dead eyes were accustomed
to behold.Beaten by winds and waves till the grey of its slate
formation is nearly black; worn into holes by the constant action of
the tide which widens yearly the space between it and the main-land,
and gnaws the rock below into dangerous hollows that in time become
sea-caves, Tintagel still remains--and one marvels that so much of it
does still remain--a landmark of the cloudy time between legend and
actual history.Whether the ruin on the opposite height was once a portion of
Tintagel Castle, before the sea divided it, making a promontory into
an island--or whether it was the Castle Terrabil, in which Gorlois,
Ygrayne's husband, was slain--no one now can say.That both the twin
fortresses were habitable till Elizabeth's time, there is evidence to
prove.But since then they have been left to decay, to the silent sheep
and the screeching ravens, including doubtless that ghostly chough, in
whose shape the soul of King Arthur is believed still to revisit the
familiar scene.We did not see that notable bird--though we watched with interest two
tame and pretty specimens of its almost extinct species walking about
in a flower-garden in the village, and superstitiously cherished there.We were told that to this day no Cornishman likes to shoot a chough
or a raven.So they live and breed in peace among the twin ruins, and
scream contentedly to the noisy stream which dances down the rocky
hollow from Trevena, and leaps into the sea at Porth Hern--the "iron
gate," over against Tintagel.We thought we had seen everything, and come to an end, but at the hotel
we found a party who had just returned from visiting some sea-caves
beyond Tintagel, which they declared were "the finest things they had
found in Cornwall."It was a lovely calm day, and it was our last day.And, I think, the looser grows one's grasp of life, the greater is
one's longing to make the most of it, to see all we can see of this
wonderful, beautiful world.So, after a hasty meal, we found ourselves
once more down at Porth Hern, seeking a boat and man--alas!not John
Curgenven--under whose guidance we might brave the stormy deep.No sooner had we rounded the rock, than the baby
waves of the tiny bay grew into hills and valleys, among which our boat
went dancing up and down like a sea-gull!"Ay, there's some sea on, there always is here, but we'll be through it
presently," indifferently said the elder of the two boatmen; and plied
his oars, as, I think, only these Cornish boatmen can do, talking all
the while.He pointed out a slate quarry, only accessible from the sea,
unless the workmen liked to be let down by ropes, which sometimes had
to be done.We saw them moving about like black emmets among the clefts
of the rocks, and heard plainly above the sound of the sea the click
of their hammers.Strange, lonely, perilous work it must be, even in
summer.In winter--

"Oh, they're used to it; we're all used to it," said our man, who was
intelligent enough, though nothing equal to John Curgenven."Many a
time I've got sea-fowls' eggs on those rocks there," pointing to a
cliff which did not seem to hold footing for a fly.The
gentry buy them, and we're glad of the money.Dangerous?--yes, rather;
but one must earn one's bread, and it's not so bad when you take to it
young."Nevertheless, I think I shall never look at a collection of sea-birds'
eggs without a slight shudder, remembering those awful cliffs."Here you are, ladies, and the sea's down a bit, as I said.Hold on,
mate, the boat will go right into the cave."And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out
of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking
on a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow
that it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them;
while beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of
the everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from
which no one could ever hope to come out alive."I don't like this at all," said a small voice."Hadn't we better get out again?"But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to
return; and begged for "only five minutes" in that wonderful place,
compared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as
nothing.Yet with its
terror was mingled an awful delight."Give me but five, nay, two
minutes more!""Very well, just as you choose," was the response of meek despair.The boatmen were told to row on into
daylight and sunshine--at least as much sunshine as the gigantic
overhanging cliffs permitted.And never, never, never in this world
shall I again behold that wonderful, mysterious sea-cave.But like all things incomplete, resigned, or lost, it has fixed itself
on my memory with an almost painful vividness.However, I promised not
to regret--not to say another word about it; and I will not.I did see
it, for just a glimpse; and that will serve.Two more pictures remain, the last gorgeous sunset, which I watched in
quiet solitude, sitting on a tombstone by Tintagel church--a building
dating from Saxon times, perched on the very edge of a lofty cliff,
and with a sea-view that reaches from Trevose Head on one side to Bude
Haven on the other.Also, our last long dreamy drive; in the mild
September sunshine, across the twenty-one miles of sparsely inhabited
country which lie between Tintagel and Launceston.In the midst of
it, on the top of a high flat of moorland, our driver turned round
and pointed with his whip to a long low mound, faintly visible about
half-a-mile off."There, ladies, that's King Arthur's grave."The third, at least, that we had either seen or heard of.These varied
records of the hero's last resting-place remind one of the three heads,
said to be still extant, of Oliver Cromwell, one when he was a little
boy, one as a young man, and the third as an old man.But after all my last and vividest recollection of King Arthur's
country is that wild sail--so wild that I wished I had taken it
alone--in the solitary boat, up and down the tossing waves in face of
Tintagel rock; the dark, iron-bound coast with its awful caves, the
bright sunshiny land, and ever-threatening sea.Just the region, in
short, which was likely to create a race like that which Arthurian
legend describes, full of passionate love and deadly hate, capable of
barbaric virtues, and equally barbaric crimes.An age in which the mere
idea of such a hero as that ideal knight

  "Who reverenced his conscience as his God:
  Whose glory was redressing human wrong:
  Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it:
  Who loved one only, and who clave to her--"

rises over the blackness of darkness like a morning star.If Arthur could "come again"--perhaps in the person of one of the
descendants of a prince who was not unlike him, who lived and died
among us in this very nineteenth century--

  "Wearing the white flower of a blameless life--"

if this could be--what a blessing for Arthur's beloved England![Illustration: THE OLD POST-OFFICE, TREVENA.]L'ENVOI


Written more than a year after.The "old hen" and her chickens have
long been safe at home.A dense December fog creeps in everywhere,
choking and blinding, as I finish the history of those fifteen innocent
days, calm as autumn, and bright as spring, when we three took our
Unsentimental Journey together through Cornwall.Many a clever critic,
like Sir Charles Coldstream when he looked into the crater of Vesuvius,
may see "nothing in it"--a few kindly readers looking a little further,
may see a little more: probably the writer only sees the whole.But such as it is, let it stay--simple memorial of what Americans would
call "a good time," the sunshine of which may cast its brightness far
forward, even into that quiet time "when travelling days are done."LONDON:
  R. CLAY, SONS, AND TAYLOR,
  BREAD STREET HILL, E.C.Soon Fancy, with a graphic sweep,
    Portrays the nightmares of the deep;
    While they can see, with living eye,
    The terrors of the air sweep by.[Illustration]

        For who would not a fierce bird dread,
        If it came flying at his head?And these were hungry, squawking things,
        With open beaks and flapping wings.They made the Brownies dodge and dip,
        Into the sea they feared to slip.The birds they viewed with chattering teeth,
    Yet dreaded more the foes beneath.The lobster, with his ready claw;
    The fish with sword, the fish with saw;
    The hermit-crab, in coral hall,
    Averse to every social call;
    The father-lasher, and the shrimp,
    The cuttle-fish, or ocean imp,
    All these increase the landsman's fright,
    As shores are fading out of sight.Such fear soon gained complete command
    Of every Brownie in the band.They looked behind, where fair and green
    The grassy banks and woods were seen.They looked ahead, where white and cold
    The foaming waves of ocean rolled,
    And then, with woful faces drew
    Comparisons between the two.[Illustration]

    Some blamed themselves for action rash
    Against all reason still to dash
    In danger's way, and never think
    Until they stood on ruin's brink.While others threw the blame on those
    Who did the risky trip propose.But meantime deep and deeper still
    The whale was settling down until
    His back looked like an island small
    That scarce gave standing-room to all.But, when their chance seemed slight indeed
    To sport again o'er dewy mead,
    The spouting whale, with movement strong,
    Ran crashing through some timbers long
    That lumbermen had strongly tied
    In cribs and rafts, an acre wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    'Twas then, in such a trying hour,
    The Brownies showed their nerve and power.The diving whale gave little time
    For them to choose a stick to climb,--
    But grips were strong; no hold was lost,
    However high the logs were tossed;
    By happy chance the boom remained
    That to the nearest shore was chained,
    And o'er that bridge the Brownies made
    A safe retreat to forest shade.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' KITES.[Illustration]

    The sun had hardly taken flight
    Unto the deepest caves of night;
    Or fowls secured a place of rest
    Where Reynard's paw could not molest,
    When Brownies gathered to pursue
    Their plans regarding pleasures new.Said one: "In spite of hand or string,
        Now hats fly round like crows in spring,
        Exposing heads to gusts of air,
    That ill the slightest draught can bear;
    While, high above the tallest tower,
    At morning, noon, and evening hour,
    The youngsters' kites with streaming tails
    Are riding out the strongest gales.The doves in steeples hide away
        Or keep their houses through the day,
        Mistaking every kite that flies
        For bird of prey of wondrous size."[Illustration]

        "You're not alone," another cried,
        "In taking note.I, too, have spied
        The boys of late, in street and court,
        Or on the roofs, at this fine sport;
        But yesternight I chanced to see
        A kite entangled in a tree.The string was nowhere to be found;
        The tail about a bough was wound.Some birds had torn the paper out,
        To line their nests, in trees about,
        But there beside the wreck I staid,
        Until I learned how kites are made.On me you safely may depend,
        To show the way to cut and bend.So let us now, while winds are high,
        Our hands at once to work apply;
        And from the hill that lifts its crown
        So far above the neighboring town,
        We'll send our kites aloft in crowds,
        To lose themselves among the clouds."A smile on every face was spread,
        At thought of fun like this, ahead;
        And quickly all the plans were laid,
        And work for every Brownie made.Some to the kitchens ran in haste,
        To manufacture pots of paste.Some ran for tacks or shingle-nails,
        And some for rags to make the tails,
        While more with loads of paper came,
        Or whittled sticks to make the frame.The strings, that others gathered, soon
        Seemed long enough to reach the moon.But where such quantities they found,
        'Tis not so easy to expound;--
        Perhaps some twine-shop, standing nigh,
        Was raided for the large supply;
        Perhaps some youthful angler whines
        About his missing fishing-lines.But let them find                   things where they will,
    The Brownies must                   be furnished still;
    And those who can't                 such losses stand,
    Will have to charge                 it to the Band.With busy fingers,                  well applied,
    They clipped and                    pasted, bent and tied;
    With paint and                      brush some ran about
    From kite to kite,                  to fit them out.On some they paint                  a visage fair,
    While others would                  affright a bear,
        Nor was it long (as one might guess
        Who knows what skill their hands possess)
        Before the kites, with string and tail,
        Were all prepared to ride the gale;
        And oh, the climax of their glee
        Was reached when kites were floating free!So quick they mounted through the air
        That tangling strings played mischief there,
    And threatened to remove from land
    Some valued members of the band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The birds of night were horrified
    At finding kites on every side,
    And netted strings, that seemed to be
    Designed to limit action free.But Brownies stood or ran about,
    Now winding up, now letting out;
    Now giving kites more tail or wing,
    Now wishing for a longer string;
    Until they saw the hints of day
    Approaching through the morning gray.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' DANCING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

    When flitting bats commenced to wheel
    Around the eaves to find their meal,
    And owls to hoot in forests wide,
    To call their owlets to their side,
    The Brownie Band, in full array,
    Through silent streets pursued their way.But as they neared a building high,
    Surprise was shown in every eye.They heard the strains of music sweet,
    And tripping of the dancers' feet;
    While o'er the tap of heel and toe,
    The twang of harp and scrape of bow,
    Arose the clear and ringing call
    Of those who had control of all.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The Brownies slackened their swift pace,
    Then gathered closely round the place,
            To study out some way to win
            A peep or two at those within.Said one: "In matters of this kind
            Opinions differ, you will find.And some might say, with sober thought,
            That children should not thus be taught
            To hop around on toe and heel
            So actively to fiddle's squeal,
                For fear 'twould turn their minds away
                From graver duties of the day."Another said: "The dancing art
                Doth ease to every move impart.It gives alike to city-bred
                And country-born a graceful tread,
            And helps them bear themselves along
            Without offense in greatest throng.The nimble step, the springing knee,
    And balanced body all agree.The feet, my friends, may glide with grace
    As well as trudge from place to place.And in the parlor or without
    They best can stand or walk about
    Who found in early life a chance
    To mingle in the sprightly dance."[Illustration]

    The Brownies need no ladders long,
    No hoists, nor elevators strong,
    To lift them to an upper flight,
    A window-sill, or transom light.The weather-vane upon the spire,
    That overlooks the town entire,
    Is not too high above the base
    If fancy leads them to the place.'Tis said the very fleecy clouds
    They can bestride in eager crowds,
    Around the world their way to find,
    And leave the lagging winds behind.Said one: "We've scaled the dizzy heights
    Of mountain-peaks on other nights,
    And crossed the stream from shore to shore
    Where but the string-piece stretched before;
    And cunning Brownies, never fear,
    Will find some way to enter here."[Illustration]

    When once the Brownies' plans were laid,
    No formal, tiresome speech was made.In mystic ways, to Brownies known,
    They clambered up the walls of stone.They clung to this and that, like briers,
    They climbed the smooth electric wires;
    Some members lending ready aid
    To those who weaker nerves displayed.And in five minutes at the most,
    By vine, by bracket, and by post,
    By every scroll, and carving bold,
    That toes could touch or fingers hold
    They made their way, and gained a chance
    To view, unnoticed, every dance.Said one: "How pleasant is the sight
    To see those children young and bright
    While skipping blithely to and fro,
    Now joined in pairs, now in a row,
    Or formed in circles, hand in hand,
    And lightly moving at command--

[Illustration]

        Like butterflies through balmy air
        When summer spreads attractions fair,
    And blends with every whispering breeze
    The drowsy hum of working bees."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Another said: "When this is o'er
    The Brownie Band will take the floor.We'll bide our time and not be slow
            To take possession when they go.Then up and down the spacious hall
              We'll imitate the steps of all.We'll show that not in Frenchmen's bones
              Lies all the grace that nature owns;
              That others at the waltz can shine
              As well as Germans from the Rhine;
            That we some capers can enjoy
            As well as natives of Savoy."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            While thus they talked, the moments flew,
            And soon the master's task was through.When children's cloaks were wrapped around,
    And heavier shoes their feet had found
    They hastened home; but while they slept
    The Brownies in that building crept
    To take their turn at lively reel,
            At graceful glide, or dizzy wheel,
            Till all the dances people know,
              From Cuba's palms to Russia's snow
              Were tried, and soon in every case
              Were mastered with surprising grace.Imagine how they skipped about,
              And how they danced, with laugh and shout![Illustration]

[Illustration]

    No sooner had the Brownies run
    Into the hall than 'twas begun.Some round the harp, with cunning stroke,
    The music in the strings awoke.The violins to others fell,
    Who scraped, and sawed, and fingered well,
    Until the sweet and stirring air
    Would rouse the feet of dullest there.Like people in the spring of life,
    Of joys and countless blessings rife,
    Who yield themselves to Pleasure's hand--
    So danced that night the Brownie Band.First one would take his place to show
    The special step for heel or toe,
    Just how to edge about with care,
    And help around the partner fair,
    Nor plant his feet upon a dress--
    To cause confusion and distress.Then more would play the master's part,
    And give some lessons in the art:

[Illustration]

        Would show the rest some figures new
        From Turkey, China, or Peru.Now smoothly glide, as if on wings,
    Then bob around, as if on springs,
    Until the sprightly steps would call
    Loud acclamations from them all.They danced in twos with skip and bound,
    They danced in circles, round and round;
    They danced in lines that coiled about
    As runs the serpent in and out,
    Some moving slow, some standing still--
    More cutting capers with a will.At length, by joining hand in hand,
    The set included all the band.A happier crowd was never seen
    On ball-room floor or village green.By turns they danced, by turns would go
    And try their skill at string and bow--
    They almost sawed the fiddle through,
    So fast the bow across it flew.And louder still the harp would ring,
    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.Alike they seemed a skillful band
    Upon the floor or music-stand.The night wore on, from hour to hour,
    And still they danced with vim and power;
    For supple-kneed and light of toe
    The Brownies are, as well you know,
    And such a thing as tiring out
    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.As long as darkness hung her pall
    In heavy folds around the hall,
    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,
    Until the very break of day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    To dance the figures o'er and o'er,
    They lingered on the polished floor;
    No sooner was one party done
    Than others the position won.They chose their partners for the set,
    And bowed, and scraped, and smiling, met.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As night advanced, and morning gray
    Nigh and still nigher cast its ray,
    The lively Brownies faster flew,
    Across and back, around and through;
    Now down the center, up the side,
    Then back to place with graceful glide--
                  Until it seemed that even day
                  Would hardly drive the band away.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                  At length some, more upon their guard
                  Against surprises, labored hard
    To urge their comrades from the place
    Before the sun would show his face.They pulled and hauled with all their might
    At those half crazy with delight,
                  Who still would struggle for a chance
                  To have, at least, another dance--
                  Some figure that was quite forgot,
                          Although "the finest of the lot."Another wished to linger still--
                          In spite of warning words--until
                          Each member present on the floor
                          Had been his partner twice or more.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Meantime, outside, the tell-tale dyes
                Of morn began to paint the skies,
                And, one by one, the stars of night
                Grew pale before the morning's light.Alone, bright Venus, in the west,
                Upheld her torch and warned the rest;
                While from the hedge the piping note
                Of waking birds began to float;
    And crows upon the wooded hills
    Commenced to stir and whet their bills,
    When Brownies scampered from the place,
    And undertook the homeward race.Nor made a halt in street or square,
    Or verdant park, however fair;
    But farther from the sight of man
    And light of day, they quickly ran.They traveled at their highest speed,
    And swiftly must they go, indeed;
    For, like the spokes of some great wheel,
    The rays of light began to steal
    Still higher up the eastern sky,
    And showed the sun was rolling nigh.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.[Illustration]

    One evening, while the Brownies sat
    Enjoying free and friendly chat,
    Some on the trees, some on the ground,
    And others perched on fences round--
    One Brownie, rising in his place,
    Addressed the band with beaming face.The listeners gathered with delight
    Around the member, bold and bright,
    To hear him tell of scenes he'd spied
    While roaming through the country wide."Last eve," said he, "to shun the blast,
    Behind a cottage fence I passed.While there, I heard a merry rout,
    And as the yard was dark without,
    I crawled along through weeds and grass,
    Through melon-vines and broken glass,
    Until I might, unnoticed, win
    A glimpse of all the sport within.At length, below the window-pane,
                    To reach the sill I stretched in vain;
                    But, thanks to my inquiring mind
                    And sundry bricks, I chanced to find
    The facts I can relate in full
    About that lively candy-pull.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "An hour or more, I well believe,
    I stood, their actions to perceive,
    With elbows resting on the sill,
    And nose against the window still.I watched them closely at their fun,
    And learned how everything was done.The younger members took the lead,
    And carried on the work with speed.With nimble feet they ran about
    From place to place, with laugh and shout;
    But older heads looked on the while,
    And cheered the youngsters with a smile,
    And gave advice in manner kind
    To guide the inexperienced mind.They placed the sugar in a pot,
    And stirred it round till boiling hot;
    Then rolled and worked it in their hands,
    And stretched it out in shining bands,
    Until it reached across the floor,
    From mantel-piece to kitchen door."These eyes of mine for many a night
    Have not beheld a finer sight.To pull the candy was the part
    Of some who seemed to know the art.The moon had slipped behind the hill,
    And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will;
    But still, with nose against the pane,
    I kept my place through wind and rain.There, perched upon the shaky pile,
    With bated breath I gazed the while.I watched them with the sharpest sight
    That I might tell the tale aright;
    For all the active youngsters there
    Appeared to have of work their share.Some put fresh sugar in the pot,
    Some kept the fire blazing hot,
    And worked away as best they could
    To keep the stove well filled with wood.Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill,
    At moving here and there at will,
    Would have to 'lively' be and 'tear
    Around' to beat those children there!Some cut it up, more passed it round,
    While others ate it by the pound!"[Illustration]

    At this, a murmur of surprise
    On every side began to rise;
    Then smiles o'er every visage flitted,
    As wide as cheeks and ears permitted,
    That told what train of thought had sped
    At once through every Brownie's head--
    A thought of pleasure near at hand
    That well would suit the cunning band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            The Brownies act without delay
            When new ideas cross their way,
            And soon one raised a finger small
            And close attention gained from all.They crowded near with anxious glance
            To learn what scheme he could advance--
    What methods mention or employ
    To bring about the promised joy.Said he: "A vacant house is near.The owner leaves it every year
    For several months, and pleasure seeks
    On ocean waves or mountain peaks.The range is there against the wall,
            The pots, the pans, the spoons, and all,
            While cans of syrup may be found
            In every grocer's store around.The Brownie must be dull and tame,
            And scarce deserves to bear the name,
            Who will not join with heart and hand
            To carry out a scheme so grand."[Illustration]

    Another cried: "When to his bed
    The sun to-morrow stoops his head,
    Again we'll muster in full force
    And to that building turn our course."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Next eve they gained the street at last
            That through the silent city passed;
            And soon they paused, their eyes they raised
            And on the vacant mansion gazed.In vain the miser hides his store,
    In vain the merchant bars his door,
    In vain the locksmith changes keys--
    The Brownies enter where they please.Through iron doors, through gates of brass,
    And walls of stone they safely pass,
    And smile to think how soon they can
    Upset the studied schemes of man.Within that house, without delay,
    Behind the guide they worked their way,
    More happy far and full of glee
    Than was the owner, out at sea.The whale, the shark, or fish that flies
    Had less attraction for his eyes
    Than had the shining candy-balls
    For Brownies, swarming through his halls.Soon coal was from the cellar brought
    And kindling wood came, quick as thought;
    Then pots and pans came rattling in
    And syrup sweet, in cans of tin.Just where the syrup had been found
    It matters not.The cunning band was soon possessed
    Of full supplies and of the best;
    Next tablespoons of silver fine
    In every hand appeared to shine,
    And ladles long, of costly ware,
    That had been laid away with care.No sooner was the syrup hot
    Than some around the kettle got,
    And dabbed away in eager haste
    To be the first to get a taste.Then some were scalded when the spoon
    Let fall its contents all too soon,
            And gave the tongue too warm a mess
            To carry without some distress.Then steps were into service brought
            That dancing-masters never taught,
            And smothered cries and swinging hand
            Would wake the wonder of the band.And when the candy boiled until
            It could be pulled and hauled at will,
    Take every shape or twist, and seem
    As free as fancy in a dream,
    The busy, happy-hearted crew
    Enjoyed the moments as they flew.The Brownies in the building stayed
    And candy ate as fast as made.But when at length the brightening sky
    Gave warning they must homeward fly,
    They quickly sought the open air
    And had but little time to spare.The shortest way, as often found,
    Was o'er the roughest piece of ground,
    Where rocks as large as houses lay
    All scattered round in wild array.Some covered o'er with clinging vines,
    Some bearing up gigantic pines,
    Or spreading oaks, that rooted fast,
    For centuries had stood the blast.But over all the rugged ground
    The Brownies passed with lightsome bound,
    Now jumping clear from block to block,
    Now sliding down the shelving rock,
    Or cheering on the lagging kind
    Who here and there would fall behind.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                One night the Brownies found their way
                To where some tracks and switches lay,
                And buildings stood, such as are found
    In every town on railroad ground.They moved about from place to place,
    With prying eyes and cautious pace
    They peeped in shops and gained a view,
    Where cars were standing bright and new;
    While others, that had service known,
    And in some crash were overthrown,
    On jack-screws, blocks, and such affairs,
    Were undergoing full repairs.The table that turns end for end
            Its heavy load, without a bend,
            Was next inspected through and through
            And tested by the wondering crew.They scanned the signal-lights with care
            That told the state of switches there,--
            Showed whether tracks kept straight ahead,
            Or simply to some siding led.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then round a locomotive strong
                They gathered in an earnest throng,
                Commenting on the style it showed,
                Its strength and speed upon the road.Said one: "That 'pilot' placed before
                Will toss a cow a block or more;
            You'd hardly find a bone intact
            When such a thing her frame has racked--
            Above the fence, and, if you please,
            Above the smoke-stack and the trees
            Will go the horns and heels in air,
            When hoisted by that same affair.""Sometimes it saves," another cried,
            "And throws an object far aside
            That would to powder have been ground,
            If rushing wheels a chance had found.I saw a goat tossed from the track
            And landed on a farmer's stack,
            And though surprised at fate so strange,
            He seemed delighted at the change;
            And lived content, on best of fare,
            Until the farmer found him there."Another said: "We'll have some fun
    And down the road this engine run.The steam is up, as gauges show;
    She's puffing, ready now to go;
    The fireman and the engineer
    Are at their supper, in the rear
    Of yonder shed.I took a peep,
    And found the watchman fast asleep.So now's our time, if we but haste,
    The joys of railway life to taste.I know the engine-driver's art,
    Just how to stop, reverse, and start;
    I've watched them when they little knew
    From every move I knowledge drew;
    We'll not be seen till under way,
    And then, my friends, here let me say,
    The man or beast will something lack
    Who strives to stop us on the track."Then some upon the engine stepped,
    And some upon the pilot crept,
    And more upon the tender found
    A place to sit and look around.And soon away the engine rolled
    At speed 'twas fearful to behold;
    It seemed they ran, where tracks were straight,
    At least at mile-a-minute rate;
    And even where the curves were short
    The engine turned them with a snort
    That made the Brownies' hearts the while
    Rise in their throats, for half a mile.But travelers many dangers run
    On safest roads beneath the sun.They ran through yards, where dogs came out
    To choke with dust that whirled about,
    And so could neither growl nor bark
    Till they had vanished in the dark;
    Some pigs that wandered late at night,
    And neither turned to left nor right,
        But on the crossing held debate
        Who first should squeeze beneath the gate,
        Were helped above the fence to rise
        Ere they had time to squeal surprise,
        And never after cared to stray
        Along the track by night or day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        But when a town was just in sight,
        And speed was at its greatest height,--
        Alas!that such a thing should be,--
        An open switch the Brownies see.Then some thought best at once to go
                        Into the weeds and ditch below;
                        But many on the engine stayed
                        And held their grip, though much dismayed.And waited for the shock to fall
                        That would decide the fate of all.In vain reversing tricks were tried,
                        And brakes to every wheel applied;
                        The locomotive forward flew,
                        In spite of all that skill could do.But just as they approached the place
                Where trouble met them face to face,
    Through some arrangement, as it seemed,
    Of which the Brownies never dreamed,
    The automatic switch was closed,
    A safety signal-light exposed,
    And they were free to roll ahead,
    And wait for those who'd leaped in dread;
    Although the end seemed near at hand
    Of every Brownie in the band,
    And darkest heads through horrid fright
    Were in a moment changed to white,
    The injuries indeed were small.A few had suffered from their fall,
    And some were sprained about the toes,
    While more were scraped upon the nose;
    But all were able to succeed
    In climbing to a place with speed,
    And there they stayed until once more
    They passed the heavy round-house door.Then jumping down on every side
    The Brownies scampered off to hide;
    And as they crossed the trestle high
    The sun was creeping up the sky,
    And urged them onward in their race
    To find some safe abiding place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' FANCY BALL.[Illustration]

    It was the season of the year
    When people, dressed in fancy gear,
    From every quarter hurried down
    And filled the largest halls in town;
    And there to flute and fiddle sweet
    Went through their sets with lively feet.The Brownies were not slow to note
    That fun indeed was now afloat;
    And ere the season passed away,
    Of longest night and shortest day,
    They looked about to find a hall
    Where they could hold their fancy ball.Said one: "A room can soon be found
    Where all the band can troop around;
    But want of costumes, much I fear,
    Will bar our pleasure all the year."My eyes have not been shut of late,--
    Don't show a weak and hopeless mind
    Because your knowledge is confined,--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For I'm prepared to take the band
    To costumes, ready to the hand,
    Of every pattern, new or old:
    The kingly robes, with chains of gold,
    The cloak and plume of belted knight,
    The pilgrim's hat and stockings white,
    The dresses for the ladies fair,
    The gems and artificial hair,
    The soldier-suits in blue and red,
    The turban for the Tartar's head,
    All can be found where I will lead,
    If friends are willing to proceed."[Illustration]

    Those knowing best the Brownie way
    Will know there was no long delay,
    Ere to the town he made a break
    With all the Brownies in his wake.It mattered not that roads were long,
    That hills were high or winds were strong;
    Soon robes were found on peg and shelf,
    And each one chose to suit himself.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The costumes, though a world too wide,
    And long enough a pair to hide,
    Were gathered in with skill and care,
    That showed the tailor's art was there.Then out they started for the hall,
    In fancy trappings one and all;
    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;
    And some like kings; and more like clowns;
    And Highlanders, with naked knees;
    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;
    While many members in the line
    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,
    And swept along the polished floor
    A train that reached a yard or more.[Illustration]

    By happy chance some laid their hand
    Upon the outfit of a band;
    The horns and trumpets took the lead,
    Supported well by string and reed;
    And violins, that would have made
    A mansion for the rogues that played,
    With flute and clarionet combined
    In music of the gayest kind.In dances wild and strange to see
    They passed the hours in greatest glee;
    Familiar figures all were lost
    In flowing robes that round them tossed;
    And well-known faces hid behind
    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.The queen and clown, a loving pair,
    Enjoyed a light fandango there;
    While solemn monks of gentle heart,
    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.The grand salute, with courteous words,
                The bobbing up and down, like birds,
                The lively skip, the stately glide,
                The double turn, and twist aside
                Were introduced in proper place
                And carried through with ease and grace.So great the pleasure proved to all,
    Too long they tarried in the hall,
    And morning caught them on the fly,
    Ere they could put the garments by!Then dodging out in great dismay,
            By walls and stumps they made their way;
            And not until the evening's shade
            Were costumes in their places laid.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.[Illustration]

    While Brownies strayed along a pier
    To view the shipping lying near,
    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;
    'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.Cried one: "See what in black and red
    Below the pilot-house is spread!In honor of the Brownie Band,
    It bears our name in letters grand.Through all the day she's on the go;
    Now with a laden scow in tow,
    And next with barges two or three,
    Then taking out a ship to sea,
    Or through the Narrows steaming round
    In search of vessels homeward bound;
    She's stanch and true from stack to keel,
    And we should highly honored feel."Another said: "An hour ago,
    The men went up to see a show,
    And left the tugboat lying here.The steam is up, our course is clear,
    We'll crowd on board without delay
    And run her up and down the bay.We have indeed a special claim,
    Because she bears the 'Brownie' name.Before the dawn creeps through the east
    We'll know about her speed at least,
    And prove how such a craft behaves
    When cutting through the roughest waves.Behind the wheel I'll take my stand
    And steer her round with skillful hand,
    Now down the river, now around
    The bay, or up the broader sound;
    Throughout the trip I'll keep her clear
    Of all that might awaken fear.When hard-a-port the helm I bring,
    Or starboard make a sudden swing,
    The Band can rest as free from dread
    As if they slept on mossy bed.I something know about the seas,
    I've boxed a compass, if you please,
    And so can steer her east or west,
    Or north or south, as suits me best.Without the aid of twinkling stars
    Or light-house lamps, I'll cross the bars.I know when north winds nip the nose,
    Or sou'-sou'-west the 'pig-wind' blows,
    As hardy sailors call the gale
    That from that quarter strikes the sail."A third replied: "No doubt you're smart
    And understand the pilot's art,
    But more than one a hand should take,
    For all our lives will be at stake.In spite of eyes and ears and hands,
    And all the skill a crew commands,
    How oft collisions crush the keel
    And give the fish a sumptuous meal!Too many rocks around the bay
    Stick up their heads to bar the way.Too many vessels, long and wide,
    At anchor in the channel ride
    For us to show ourselves unwise
    And trust to but one pair of eyes."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long the tugboat swinging clear
    Turned bow to stream and left the pier,
    While many Brownies, young and old,
    From upper deck to lower hold
    Were crowding round in happy vein
    Still striving better views to gain.Some watched the waves around them roll;
    Some stayed below to shovel coal,
    From hand to hand, with pitches strong,
    They passed the rattling loads along.Some at the engine took a place,
    More to the pilot-house would race
    To keep a sharp lookout ahead,
    Or man the wheel as fancy led.But accidents we oft record,
    However well we watch and ward,
    And vessels often go to wreck
    With careful captains on the deck;
    They had mishaps that night, for still,
    In spite of all their care and skill,
    While running straight or turning round
    In river, bay, or broader sound,
    At times they ran upon a rock,
    And startled by the sudden shock
    Some timid Brownies, turning pale,
    Would spring at once across the rail;
    And then, repenting, find all hope
    Of life depended on a rope,
    That willing hands were quick to throw
    And hoist them from the waves below.Sometimes too near a ship they ran
    For peace of mind; again, their plan
    Would come to naught through lengthy tow
    Of barges passing to and fro.The painted buoys around the bay
    At times occasioned some dismay--
    They took them for torpedoes dread
    That might the boat in fragments spread,
    Awake the city's slumbering crowds,
    And hoist the band among the clouds.But thus, till hints of dawn appeared
    Now here, now there, the boat was steered
    With many joys and many fears,
    That some will bear in mind for years;
    But at her pier once more she lay
    When night gave place to creeping day.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' TALLY-HO.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As shades of evening closed around,
        The Brownies, from some wooded ground,
        Looked out to view with staring eye
        A Tally-Ho, then passing by.Around the park they saw it roll,
    Now sweeping round a wooded knoll,
    Now rumbling o'er an arching bridge,
    Now hid behind a rocky ridge,
    Now wheeling out again in view
    To whirl along some avenue.They hardly could restrain a shout
    When they observed the grand turnout.The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud,
    The prancing horses, and the crowd
                    Of people perched so high in air
                    Pleased every wondering Brownie there.Said one: "A rig like this we see
    Would suit the Brownies to a T!And I'm the one, here let me say,
    To put such pleasures in our way:
    I know the very place to go
    To-night to find a Tally-Ho.It never yet has borne a load
                    Of happy hearts along the road;
                    But, bright and new in every part
                    'Tis ready for an early start.The horses in the stable stand
                    With harness ready for the hand;
                    If all agree, we'll take a ride
                    For miles across the country wide."Another said: "The plan is fine;
                    You well deserve to head the line;
                    But, on the road, the reins I'll draw;
    I know the way to 'gee' and 'haw,'
    And how to turn a corner round,
    And still keep wheels upon the ground."Another answered: "No, my friend,
    We'll not on one alone depend;
    But three or four the reins will hold,
                    That horses may be well controlled.The curves are short, the hills are steep,
                    The horses fast, and ditches deep,
                    And at some places half the band
                    May have to take the lines in hand."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    That night, according to their plan,
    The Brownies to the stable ran;
    Through swamps they cut to reach the place,
    And cleared the fences in their race
      As lightly as the swallow flies
        To catch its morning meal supplies.Though, in the race, some clothes were soiled,
            And stylish shoes completely spoiled,
    Across the roughest hill or rock
    They scampered like a frightened flock,
    Now o'er inclosures knee and knee,
    With equal speed they clambered free
    And soon with faces all aglow
    They crowded round the Tally-Ho;
    But little time they stood to stare
    Or smile upon the strange affair.As many hands make labor light,
    And active fingers win the fight,
    Each busy Brownie played his part,
    And soon 't was ready for the start.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But ere they took their seats to ride
    By more than one the horns were tried,
    Each striving with tremendous strain
    The most enlivening sound to gain,
    And prove he had a special right
    To blow the horn throughout the night.[Illustration]

    Though some were crowded in a seat,
    And some were forced to keep their feet
    Or sit upon another's lap,
    And some were hanging to a strap,
    With merry laugh and ringing shout,
    And tooting horns, they drove about.A dozen miles, perhaps, or more,
    The lively band had traveled o'er,
    Commenting on their happy lot
    And keeping horses on the trot,
    When, as they passed a stunted oak
    A wheel was caught, the axle broke![Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some went out with sudden pitch,
    And some were tumbled in the ditch,
    And one jumped off to save his neck,
    While others still hung to the wreck.Confusion reigned, for coats were rent,
    And hats were crushed, and horns were bent,
    And what began with fun and clatter
    Had turned to quite a serious matter.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                        Some blamed the drivers, others thought
                        The tooting horns the trouble brought.More said, that they small wisdom showed,
                        Who left the root so near the road.But while they talked about their plight
                        Upon them burst the morning light
                        With all the grandeur and the sheen
                          That June could lavish on the scene.So hitching horses where they could,
                                  The Brownies scampered for the wood.And lucky were the Brownies spry:
                                  A dark and deep ravine was nigh
                                  That seemed to swallow them alive
    So quick were they to jump and dive,
    To safely hide from blazing day
    That fast had driven night away,
    And forced them to leave all repairs
    To other heads and hands than theirs.THE BROWNIES ON

THE RACE-TRACK.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies moved around one night
                    A seaside race-track came in sight."'T is here," said one, "the finest breed
                    Of horses often show their speed;
                    Here, neck and neck, and nose and nose,
                    Beneath the jockeys' urging blows,
                    They sweep around the level mile
                    The people shouting all the while;
    And climbing up or crowding through
    To gain a better point of view,
    So they can see beyond a doubt
    How favorites are holding out."Another said: "I know the place
    Where horses wait to-morrow's race;
    We'll strap the saddles on their back,
    And lead them out upon the track.Then some will act the jockey's part,
    And some, as judges, watch the start,
    And drop the crimson flag to show
    The start is fair and all must go."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long, the Brownies turned to haul
    Each wondering race-horse from his stall.They bridled them without delay,
        And saddles strapped in proper way.Some restless horses rearing there
        Would toss their holders high in air,
        And test the courage and the art
        Of those who took an active part.Said one: "I've lurked in yonder wood,
          And watched the races when I could.I know how all is done with care
              When thus for racing they prepare;
                How every buckle must be tight,
                And every strap and stirrup right,
    Or jockeys would be on the ground
    Before they circled half way round."When all was ready for the show
    Each Brownie rogue was nowise slow
    At climbing up to take a place
    And be a jockey in the race.Full half a dozen Brownies tried
    Upon one saddle now to ride;
    But some were into service pressed
    As judges to control the rest--
    To see that rules were kept complete,
    And then decide who won the heat.A dozen times they tried to start;
    Some shot ahead like jockeys smart,
    And were prepared to take the lead
    Around the track at flying speed.But others were so far behind,
    On horses of unruly mind,
    The judges from the stand declare
    The start was anything but fair.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        So back they'd jog at his command,
        In better shape to pass the stand.Indeed it was no simple trick
        To ride those horses, shy and quick,
        And only for the mystic art
        That is the Brownies' special part,
    A dozen backs, at least, had found
    A resting-place upon the ground.The rules of racing were not quite
    Observed in full upon that night.Around and round the track they flew,
    In spite of all the judge could do.The race, he tried to let them know,
    Had been decided long ago.But still the horses kept the track,
    With Brownies clinging to each back.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Some racers of the jumping kind
            At times disturbed the riders' mind
            When from the track they sudden wheeled,
            And over fences took the field,
            As if they hoped in some such mode
            To rid themselves of half their load.But horses, howsoever smart,
        Are not a match for Brownie art,
    For still the riders stuck through all,
    In spite of fence, or ditch, or wall.Some clung to saddle, some to mane,
    While others tugged at bridle rein.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    So all the steeds found it would pay
    To let the Brownies have their way,
    Until a glimpse of rising sun
    Soon made them leave the place and run.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' BIRTHDAY DINNER.[Illustration]

    When people through the county planned
    To give their public dinners grand,
    The Brownies met at day's decline
    To have a birthday banquet fine."The proper things," a speaker cried,
    "Await us here on every side;
    We simply have to reach and take
    And choose a place to boil and bake.With meal and flour at our feet,
    And wells of water pure and sweet,
    That Brownie must be dull indeed
    Who lacks the gumption to proceed.We'll peel the pumpkins, ripened well,
    And scoop them hollow, like a shell,
    Then slice them up the proper size
    To make at length those famous pies,
    For which the people, small and great,
    Are ever quick to reach a plate."[Illustration]

    This pleased them all; so none were slow
    In finding work at which to go.A stove that chance threw in their way
    Was put in shape without delay.Though doors were cracked, and legs were rare,
                    The spacious oven still was there,
                    Where pies and cakes and puddings wide
                    Might bake together side by side.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

              The level top, though incomplete,
              Gave pots and pans a welcome seat,
              Where stews could steam and dumplings found
              A fitting place to roll around.Some lengths of pipe were raised on high
    That made the soot and cinders fly,
    And caused a draught throughout the wreck
    That door or damper failed to check.The rogues who undertook the part,
              That tries the cook's delightful art,
              Had smarting hands and faces red
              Before the table-cloth was spread;
                      But what cared they at such an hour
                      For singeing flame or scalding shower?Such ills are always reckoned slight
                      When great successes are in sight.There cakes and tarts and cookies fine,
                      Of both the "leaf" and "notched" design,
                      Were ranged in rows around the pan
                    That into heated ovens ran;
                    Where, in what seemed a minute's space,
                    Another batch would take their place;
                    While birds, that had secured repose
                    Above the reach of Reynard's nose,
                    Without the aid of wings came down
                    To be at midnight roasted brown.They found some boards and benches laid
                    Aside by workmen at their trade,
                    And these upon the green were placed
                    By willing hands with proper haste.Said one, who board and bench combined:
                    "All art is not to cooks confined,
                    And some expertness we can show
                    As well as those who mix the dough."And all was as the speaker said;
                In fact, they were some points ahead;
              For when the cooks their triumphs showed,
            The table waited for its load.The knives and forks and dishes white
        By secret methods came to light.Much space would be required to tell
    Just how the table looked so well;
    But kitchen cupboards, three or four,
    Must there have yielded up their store;
    For all the guests on every side
    With full equipments were supplied.When people find a carver hacked,
    A saucer chipped, or platter cracked,
    They should be somewhat slow to claim
    That servants are the ones to blame;
        For Brownies may have used the ware
      And failed to show the proper care.[Illustration]

     A few, as waiters, passed about
    New dishes when the old gave out,
     And saw the plates, as soon as bare,
      Were heaped again with something rare.No member, as you may believe,
        Was anxious such a place to leave,
                Until he had a taste at least
                Of all the dishes in the feast.The Brownies, when they break their fast,
                Will eat as long as viands last,
                And even birds can not depend
                On crumbs or pickings at the end:
                The plates were scraped, the kettles clean,
                And not a morsel to be seen,
                Ere Brownies from that table ran
                To shun the prying eyes of man.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' HALLOW-EVE.[Illustration]

    On Hallow-eve, that night of fun,
     When elves and goblins frisk and run,
       And many games and tricks are tried
         At every pleasant fireside,
        The Brownies halted to survey
       A village that below them lay,
      And wondered as they rested there
    To hear the laughter fill the air
    That from the happy children came
    As they enjoyed some pleasant game.Said one: "What means this merry flow
    That comes so loudly from below,
    Uncommon pleasures must abound
    Where so much laughter can be found."Another said: "Now, by your leave,
    I'll tell you 't is All-Hallow-eve,
    When people meet to have their sport
    At curious games of every sort;
    I know them all from first to last,
    And now, before the night has passed,
    For some convenient place we'll start
    Without delay to play our part."Two dozen mouths commenced to show
    Their teeth in white and even row;
    Two dozen voices cried with speed,
    "The plan is good we're all agreed."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    And in a trice four dozen feet
    Went down the hill with even beat.Without a long or wearying race
    The Brownies soon secured a place
    That answered well in every way
    For all the games they wished to play.There tubs of water could be found,
    By which to stoop or kneel around,
    And strive to bring the pennies out
    That on the bottom slipped about.Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,
    Where some would still the coin pursue,
    And mouth about now here and there
    Without a pause or breath of air
    Until in pride, with joyful cries,
    They held aloft the captured prize.More stood the tempting bait beneath,
    And with a hasty snap of teeth
    The whirling apple thought to claim
    And shun the while the candle's flame,--
    But found that with such pleasure goes
    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    More named the oats as people do
    To try which hearts are false, which true,
    And on the griddle placed the pair
    To let them part or smoulder there;
    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,
    How often hearts were true as steel.Still others tried to read their fate
    Or fortune in a dish or plate,
    Learn whether they would ever wed,
    Or lead a single life instead;
    Or if their mate would be a blessing,
    Or prove a partner most distressing.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then others in the open air,
    Of fun and frolic had their share;
    Played "hide and seek," and "blindman's buff,"
    And "tag" o'er places smooth or rough,
    And "snap the whip" and "trip the toe,"
    And games that none but Brownies know.As if their lives at stake were placed,
    They jumped around and dodged and raced,
    And tumbled headlong to the ground
    When feet some hard obstruction found;
    At times across the level mead,
    Some proved their special claims to speed,
    And as reward of merit wore
    A wreath of green till sport was o'er.The hours flew past as hours will
    When joys do every moment fill;
    The moon grew weak and said good-night,
    And turned her pallid face from sight;
    Then weakening stars began to fail,
    But still the Brownies kept the vale;
    Full many a time had hours retired
    Much faster than the band desired,
    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay
    Aside, because of coming day,
      But never yet with greater pain
        Did they behold the crimson stain
          That morning spread along the sky,
            And told them they must homeward fly




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.[Illustration]

    The Brownies through a village bound,
    Paused in their run to look around,
    And wondered why the central square
    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: "Without delay we'll go
    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest
    So straight and high above the rest,
    We soon can choose a flag-pole there
    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend
    To trim it off from end to end,
    To peel it smooth and paint it white,
    And hoist it in the square to-night."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then to the woods the Brownies ran
    At once to carry out their plan;
    While some ran here and there with speed
    For implements to serve their need,
    Some rambled through the forest free
    To find the proper kind of tree,
    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood
    To learn if it was sound and good,
                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,
                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,
                                   To work the active Brownies fell;
      And soon with sticks beneath their load,
      The band in grand procession strode;
        It gave them quite enough to do
        To safely put the project through,
        But when they reached the square, at last,
        Some ropes around the pole were passed
        And from the tops of maples tall
        A crowd began to pull and haul,
        While others gathered at the base
        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For Brownies seldom idle stand
    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round
    They come from secret haunts profound,
    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,
    They clamber over fence and wall;
    And soon on objects here and there
    That hold positions high in air,
    And most attract the human eye,
    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire
    They climb the tall cathedral spire;
    When all the town is still below,
    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,
    By light of moon, and stars alone,
    They dust the marble and the stone,
          And with their brushes, small and great,
          They paint and gild the dial-plate;
          And bring the figures plain in sight
          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down
My spirit in stillness.That day and the next
We all were silent.When we came
To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet
Outstretch'd did fling him, crying, 'Hast no help
For me, my father!'There he died, and e'en
Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three
Fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth:

"Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope
Over them all, and for three days aloud
Call'd on them who were dead.Thus having spoke,

Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
He fasten'd, like a mastiff's 'gainst the bone
Firm and unyielding.shame
Of all the people, who their dwelling make
In that fair region, where th' Italian voice
Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack
To punish, from their deep foundations rise
Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up
The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee
May perish in the waters!What if fame
Reported that thy castles were betray'd
By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou
To stretch his children on the rack.For them,
Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair
Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,
Their tender years, thou modern Thebes!Onward we pass'd,
Where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice
Not on their feet were turn'd, but each revers'd.There very weeping suffers not to weep;
For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
Impediment, and rolling inward turns
For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears
Hang cluster'd, and like crystal vizors show,
Under the socket brimming all the cup.Now though the cold had from my face dislodg'd
Each feeling, as 't were callous, yet me seem'd
Some breath of wind I felt."Whence cometh this,"
Said I, "my master?Is not here below
All vapour quench'd?"--"'Thou shalt be speedily,"
He answer'd, "where thine eye shall tell thee whence
The cause descrying of this airy shower."Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn'd:
"O souls so cruel!that the farthest post
Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove
The harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief
Impregnate at my heart, some little space
Ere it congeal again!"I thus replied:
"Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;
And if I extricate thee not, far down
As to the lowest ice may I descend!""The friar Alberigo," answered he,
"Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd
Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date
More luscious for my fig."--"Hah!"I exclaim'd,
"Art thou too dead!"--"How in the world aloft
It fareth with my body," answer'd he,
"I am right ignorant.Such privilege
Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul
Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc'd.And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
The glazed tear-drops that o'erlay mine eyes,
Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,
As I did, yields her body to a fiend
Who after moves and governs it at will,
Till all its time be rounded; headlong she
Falls to this cistern.And perchance above
Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,
Who here behind me winters.Him thou know'st,
If thou but newly art arriv'd below.The years are many that have pass'd away,
Since to this fastness Branca Doria came.""Now," answer'd I, "methinks thou mockest me,
For Branca Doria never yet hath died,
But doth all natural functions of a man,
Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."He thus: "Not yet unto that upper foss
By th' evil talons guarded, where the pitch
Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach'd,
When this one left a demon in his stead
In his own body, and of one his kin,
Who with him treachery wrought.But now put forth
Thy hand, and ope mine eyes."men perverse in every way,
With every foulness stain'd, why from the earth
Are ye not cancel'd?Such an one of yours
I with Romagna's darkest spirit found,
As for his doings even now in soul
Is in Cocytus plung'd, and yet doth seem
In body still alive upon the earth.CANTO XXXIV

"THE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth
Towards us; therefore look," so spake my guide,
"If thou discern him."As, when breathes a cloud
Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night
Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far
A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,
Such was the fabric then methought I saw,

To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew
Behind my guide: no covert else was there.Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
Record the marvel) where the souls were all
Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass
Pellucid the frail stem.Some prone were laid,
Others stood upright, this upon the soles,
That on his head, a third with face to feet
Arch'd like a bow.When to the point we came,
Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see
The creature eminent in beauty once,
He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.and lo the place,
Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."How frozen and how faint I then became,
Ask me not, reader!for I write it not,
Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.Think thyself
If quick conception work in thee at all,
How I did feel.That emperor, who sways
The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice
Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
A giant, than the giants are in his arms.Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits
With such a part.If he were beautiful
As he is hideous now, and yet did dare
To scowl upon his Maker, well from him
May all our mis'ry flow.How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy
Upon his head three faces: one in front
Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this
Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;
The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left
To look on, such as come from whence old Nile
Stoops to the lowlands.Under each shot forth
Two mighty wings, enormous as became
A bird so vast.Sails never such I saw
Outstretch'd on the wide sea.No plumes had they,
But were in texture like a bat, and these
He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still
Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth
Was frozen.At six eyes he wept: the tears
Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd
Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three
Were in this guise tormented.But far more
Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd
By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back
Was stript of all its skin."That upper spirit,
Who hath worse punishment," so spake my guide,
"Is Judas, he that hath his head within
And plies the feet without.Of th' other two,
Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw
Who hangs, is Brutus: lo!how he doth writhe
And speaks not!Th' other Cassius, that appears
So large of limb.But night now re-ascends,
And it is time for parting.I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;
And noting time and place, he, when the wings
Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,
And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd
Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh
Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,
My leader there with pain and struggling hard
Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,
And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,
That into hell methought we turn'd again."Expect that by such stairs as these," thus spake
The teacher, panting like a man forespent,
"We must depart from evil so extreme."Then at a rocky opening issued forth,
And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd
With wary step my side.I rais'd mine eyes,
Believing that I Lucifer should see
Where he was lately left, but saw him now
With legs held upward.Let the grosser sort,
Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,
Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then."Arise," my master cried, "upon thy feet.The way is long, and much uncouth the road;
And now within one hour and half of noon
The sun returns."It was no palace-hall
Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,
But natural dungeon where ill footing was
And scant supply of light."Ere from th' abyss
I sep'rate," thus when risen I began,
"My guide!vouchsafe few words to set me free
From error's thralldom.How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?And how from eve to morn in space so brief
Hath the sun made his transit?"He in few
Thus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still
On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd
Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I
Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass
That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd
All heavy substance.Thou art now arriv'd
Under the hemisphere opposed to that,
Which the great continent doth overspread,
And underneath whose canopy expir'd
The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd.Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,
Whose other aspect is Judecca.Morn
Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,
Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,
As at the first.On this part he fell down
From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,
And to our hemisphere retir'd.Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears,
That sprang aloof."There is a place beneath,
From Belzebub as distant, as extends
The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,
But by the sound of brooklet, that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock,
Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,
The wave hath eaten.By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter, to return
To the fair world: and heedless of repose
We climbed, he first, I following his steps,
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.He is much troubled at
it, and will speak to the King and Council of it this morning.So I went
to my Lady's and dined with her, and found my Lord Hinchingbroke somewhat
better.After dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Theatre, and there saw
"The Alchymist;" and there I saw Sir W. Pen, who took us when the play was
done and carried the Captain to Paul's and set him down, and me home with
him, and he and I to the Dolphin, but not finding Sir W. Batten there, we
went and carried a bottle of wine to his house, and there sat a while and
talked, and so home to bed.Creed of
the 15th of July last, that tells me that my Lord is rid of his pain
(which was wind got into the muscles of his right side) and his feaver,
and is now in hopes to go aboard in a day or two, which do give me mighty
great comfort.To the Privy Seal and Whitehall, up and down, and at noon Sir W.
Pen carried me to Paul's, and so I walked to the Wardrobe and dined with
my Lady, and there told her, of my Lord's sickness (of which though it
hath been the town-talk this fortnight, she had heard nothing) and
recovery, of which she was glad, though hardly persuaded of the latter.I
found my Lord Hinchingbroke better and better, and the worst past.Thence
to the Opera, which begins again to-day with "The Witts," never acted yet
with scenes; and the King and Duke and Duchess were there (who dined
to-day with Sir H. Finch, reader at the Temple, in great state); and
indeed it is a most excellent play, and admirable scenes.So home and was
overtaken by Sir W. Pen in his coach, who has been this afternoon with my
Lady Batten, &c., at the Theatre.So I followed him to the Dolphin, where
Sir W. Batten was, and there we sat awhile, and so home after we had made
shift to fuddle Mr.At the office all the morning, though little to be done; because
all our clerks are gone to the buriall of Tom Whitton, one of the
Controller's clerks, a very ingenious, and a likely young man to live, as
any in the Office.But it is such a sickly time both in City and country
every where (of a sort of fever), that never was heard of almost, unless
it was in a plague-time.Among others, the famous Tom Fuller is dead of it; and Dr.Nichols, Dean
of Paul's; and my Lord General Monk is very dangerously ill.Dined at
home with the children and were merry, and my father with me; who after
dinner he and I went forth about business.John Williams at an alehouse, where we staid till past nine at
night, in Shoe Lane, talking about our country business, and I found him
so well acquainted with the matters of Gravely that I expect he will be of
great use to me.I understand my Aunt Fenner is upon
the point of death.At the Privy Seal, where we had a seal this morning.Then met with
Ned Pickering, and walked with him into St.James's Park (where I had not
been a great while), and there found great and very noble alterations.And, in our discourse, he was very forward to complain and to speak loud
of the lewdness and beggary of the Court, which I am sorry to hear, and
which I am afeard will bring all to ruin again.So he and I to the
Wardrobe to dinner, and after dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Opera,
and saw "The Witts" again, which I like exceedingly.The Queen of Bohemia
was here, brought by my Lord Craven.So the Captain and I and another to
the Devil tavern and drank, and so by coach home.Troubled in mind that I
cannot bring myself to mind my business, but to be so much in love of
plays.We have been at a great loss a great while for a vessel that I
sent about a month ago with, things of my Lord's to Lynn, and cannot till
now hear of them, but now we are told that they are put into Soale Bay,
but to what purpose I know not.To our own church in the morning and so home to
dinner, where my father and Dr.Tom Pepys came to me to dine, and were
very merry.Sidney to my Lady to see
my Lord Hinchingbroke, who is now pretty well again, and sits up and walks
about his chamber.So I went to White Hall, and there hear that my Lord
General Monk continues very ill: so I went to la belle Pierce and sat with
her; and then to walk in St.James's Park, and saw great variety of fowl
which I never saw before and so home.At night fell to read in "Hooker's
Ecclesiastical Polity," which Mr.Moore did give me last Wednesday very
handsomely bound; and which I shall read with great pains and love for his
sake.At the office all the morning; at noon the children are sent for by
their mother my Lady Sandwich to dinner, and my wife goes along with them
by coach, and she to my father's and dines there, and from thence with
them to see Mrs.Cordery, who do invite them before my father goes into
the country, and thither I should have gone too but that I am sent for to
the Privy Seal, and there I found a thing of my Lord Chancellor's

     [This "thing" was probably one of those large grants which Clarendon
     quietly, or, as he himself says, "without noise or scandal,"
     procured from the king.Besides lands and manors, Clarendon states
     at one time that the king gave him a "little billet into his hand,
     that contained a warrant of his own hand-writing to Sir Stephen Fox
     to pay to the Chancellor the sum of L20,000,--[approximately 10
     million dollars in the year 2000]--of which nobody could have
     notice."In 1662 he received L5,000 out of the money voted to the
     king by the Parliament of Ireland, as he mentions in his vindication
     of himself against the impeachment of the Commons; and we shall see
     that Pepys, in February, 1664, names another sum of L20,000 given to
     the Chancellor to clear the mortgage upon Clarendon Park; and this
     last sum, it was believed, was paid from the money received from
     France by the sale of Dunkirk.--B.]to be sealed this afternoon, and so I am forced to go to Worcester House,
where severall Lords are met in Council this afternoon.And while I am
waiting there, in comes the King in a plain common riding-suit and velvet
cap, in which he seemed a very ordinary man to one that had not known him.Here I staid till at last, hearing that my Lord Privy Seal had not the
seal here, Mr.Moore and I hired a coach and went to Chelsy, and there at
an alehouse sat and drank and past the time till my Lord Privy Seal came
to his house, and so we to him and examined and sealed the thing, and so
homewards, but when we came to look for our coach we found it gone, so we
were fain to walk home afoot and saved our money.We met with a companion
that walked with us, and coming among some trees near the Neate houses, he
began to whistle, which did give us some suspicion, but it proved that he
that answered him was Mr.Marsh (the Lutenist) and his wife, and so we all
walked to Westminster together, in our way drinking a while at my cost,
and had a song of him, but his voice is quite lost.So walked home, and
there I found that my Lady do keep the children at home, and lets them not
come any more hither at present, which a little troubles me to lose their
company.At the office in the morning and all the afternoon at home to put
my papers in order.This day we come to some agreement with Sir R. Ford
for his house to be added to the office to enlarge our quarters.This morning by appointment I went to my father, and after a
morning draft he and I went to Dr.Williams, but he not within we went to
Mrs.Whately's, who lately offered a proposal of
her sister for a wife for my brother Tom, and with her we discoursed about
and agreed to go to her mother this afternoon to speak with her, and in
the meantime went to Will.Joyce's and to an alehouse, and drank a good
while together, he being very angry that his father Fenner will give him
and his brother no more for mourning than their father did give him and my
aunt at their mother's death, and a very troublesome fellow I still find
him to be, that his company ever wearys me.From thence about two o'clock
to Mrs.Whately's, but she being going to dinner we went to Whitehall and
there staid till past three, and here I understand by Mr.Moore that my
Lady Sandwich is brought to bed yesterday of a young Lady, and is very
well.Whately's again, and there were well received, and she
desirous to have the thing go forward, only is afeard that her daughter is
too young and portion not big enough, but offers L200 down with her.The
girl is very well favoured,, and a very child, but modest, and one I think
will do very well for my brother: so parted till she hears from Hatfield
from her husband, who is there; but I find them very desirous of it, and
so am I. Hence home to my father's, and I to the Wardrobe, where I supped
with the ladies, and hear their mother is well and the young child, and so
home.To the Privy Seal, and sealed; so home at noon, and there took my
wife by coach to my uncle Fenner's, where there was both at his house and
the Sessions, great deal of company, but poor entertainment, which I
wonder at; and the house so hot, that my uncle Wight, my father and I were
fain to go out, and stay at an alehouse awhile to cool ourselves.Then
back again and to church, my father's family being all in mourning, doing
him the greatest honour, the world believing that he did give us it: so to
church, and staid out the sermon, and then with my aunt Wight, my wife,
and Pall and I to her house by coach, and there staid and supped upon a
Westphalia ham, and so home and to bed.This morning I went to my father's, and there found him and my
mother in a discontent, which troubles me much, and indeed she is become
very simple and unquiet.Williams, and found him
within, and there we sat and talked a good while, and from him to Tom
Trice's to an alehouse near, and there sat and talked, and finding him
fair we examined my uncle's will before him and Dr.Williams, and had them
sign the copy and so did give T. Trice the original to prove, so he took
my father and me to one of the judges of the Court, and there we were
sworn, and so back again to the alehouse and drank and parted.Williams and I to a cook's where we eat a bit of mutton, and away, I to W.
Joyce's, where by appointment my wife was, and I took her to the Opera,
and shewed her "The Witts," which I had seen already twice, and was most
highly pleased with it.So with my wife to the Wardrobe to see my Lady,
and then home.At the office all the morning and did business; by and by we are
called to Sir W. Batten's to see the strange creature that Captain Holmes
hath brought with him from Guiny; it is a great baboon, but so much like a
man in most things, that though they say there is a species of them, yet I
cannot believe but that it is a monster got of a man and she-baboon.I do
believe that it already understands much English, and I am of the mind it
might be taught to speak or make signs.Hence the Comptroller and I to
Sir Rd.Ford's and viewed the house again, and are come to a complete end
with him to give him L200 per an.Isham
inquiring for me to take his leave of me, he being upon his voyage to
Portugal, and for my letters to my Lord which are not ready.But I took
him to the Mitre and gave him a glass of sack, and so adieu, and then
straight to the Opera, and there saw "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," done
with scenes very well, but above all, Betterton

     [Sir William Davenant introduced the use of scenery.The character
     of Hamlet was one of Betterton's masterpieces.Downes tells us that
     he was taught by Davenant how the part was acted by Taylor of the
     Blackfriars, who was instructed by Shakespeare himself.]Hence homeward, and met with
Mr.Spong and took him to the Sampson in Paul's churchyard, and there
staid till late, and it rained hard, so we were fain to get home wet, and
so to bed.At church in the morning, and dined at home alone with
my wife very comfortably, and so again to church with her, and had a very
good and pungent sermon of Mr.Mills, discoursing the necessity of
restitution.Home, and I found my Lady Batten and her daughter to look
something askew upon my wife, because my wife do not buckle to them, and
is not solicitous for their acquaintance, which I am not troubled at at
all.By and by comes in my father (he intends to go into the country
to-morrow), and he and I among other discourse at last called Pall up to
us, and there in great anger told her before my father that I would keep
her no longer, and my father he said he would have nothing to do with her.At last, after we had brought down her high spirit, I got my father to
yield that she should go into the country with my mother and him, and stay
there awhile to see how she will demean herself.That being done, my
father and I to my uncle Wight's, and there supped, and he took his leave
of them, and so I walked with [him] as far as Paul's and there parted, and
I home, my mind at some rest upon this making an end with Pall, who do
trouble me exceedingly.This morning before I went out I made even with my maid Jane, who
has this day been my maid three years, and is this day to go into the
country to her mother.The poor girl cried, and I could hardly forbear
weeping to think of her going, for though she be grown lazy and spoilt by
Pall's coming, yet I shall never have one to please us better in all
things, and so harmless, while I live.So I paid her her wages and gave
her 2s.over, and bade her adieu, with my mind full of trouble at her
going.Hence to my father, where he and I and Thomas together setting
things even, and casting up my father's accounts, and upon the whole I
find that all he hath in money of his own due to him in the world is but
L45, and he owes about the same sum: so that I cannot but think in what a
condition he had left my mother if he should have died before my uncle
Robert.Hence to Tom Trice for the probate of the will and had it done to
my mind, which did give my father and me good content.From thence to my
Lady at the Wardrobe and thence to the Theatre, and saw the "Antipodes,"
wherein there is much mirth, but no great matter else.Bostock whom I met there (a clerk formerly of Mr.Phelps) to the Devil
tavern, and there drank and so away.I to my uncle Fenner's, where my
father was with him at an alehouse, and so we three went by ourselves and
sat talking a great while about a broker's daughter that he do propose for
a wife for Tom, with a great portion, but I fear it will not take, but he
will do what he can.So we broke up, and going through the street we met
with a mother and son, friends of my father's man, Ned's, who are angry at
my father's putting him away, which troubled me and my father, but all
will be well as to that.We have news this morning of my uncle Thomas and
his son Thomas being gone into the country without giving notice thereof
to anybody, which puts us to a stand, but I fear them not.At night at
home I found a letter from my Lord Sandwich, who is now very well again of
his feaver, but not yet gone from Alicante, where he lay sick, and was
twice let blood.This letter dated the 22nd July last, which puts me out
of doubt of his being ill.In my coming home I called in at the Crane
tavern at the Stocks by appointment, and there met and took leave of Mr.Fanshaw, who goes to-morrow and Captain Isham toward their voyage to
Portugal.Here we drank a great deal of wine, I too much and Mr.Fanshaw
till he could hardly go.This morning to the Wardrobe, and there took leave of my Lord
Hinchingbroke and his brother, and saw them go out by coach toward Rye in
their way to France, whom God bless.Then I was called up to my Lady's
bedside, where we talked an hour about Mr.Edward Montagu's disposing of
the L5000 for my Lord's departure for Portugal, and our fears that he will
not do it to my Lord's honour, and less to his profit, which I am to
enquire a little after.Hence to the office, and there sat till noon, and
then my wife and I by coach to my cozen, Thos.Pepys, the Executor, to
dinner, where some ladies and my father and mother, where very merry, but
methinks he makes but poor dinners for such guests, though there was a
poor venison pasty.Hence my wife and I to the Theatre, and there saw
"The Joviall Crew," where the King, Duke and Duchess, and Madame Palmer,
were; and my wife, to her great content, had a full sight of them all the
while.Hence to my father's, and there staid to
talk a while and so by foot home by moonshine.In my way and at home, my
wife making a sad story to me of her brother Balty's a condition, and
would have me to do something for him, which I shall endeavour to do, but
am afeard to meddle therein for fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands
of him again, when I once concern myself for him.I went to bed, my wife
all the while telling me his case with tears, which troubled me.At home all the morning setting papers in order.At noon to the
Exchange, and there met with Dr.Williams by appointment, and with him
went up and down to look for an attorney, a friend of his, to advise with
about our bond of my aunt Pepys of L200, and he tells me absolutely that
we shall not be forced to pay interest for the money yet.I spent the whole afternoon drinking with him and so home.This day I counterfeited a letter to Sir W. Pen, as from the thief that
stole his tankard lately, only to abuse and laugh at him.At the office all the morning, and at noon my father, mother, and
my aunt Bell (the first time that ever she was at my house) come to dine
with me, and were very merry.After dinner the two women went to visit my
aunt Wight, &c., and my father about other business, and I abroad to my
bookseller, and there staid till four o'clock, at which time by
appointment I went to meet my father at my uncle Fenner's.So thither I
went and with him to an alehouse, and there came Mr.Evans, the taylor,
whose daughter we have had a mind to get for a wife for Tom, and then my
father, and there we sat a good while and talked about the business; in
fine he told us that he hath not to except against us or our motion, but
that the estate that God hath blessed him with is too great to give where
there is nothing in present possession but a trade and house; and so we
friendly ended.There parted, my father and I together, and walked a
little way, and then at Holborn he and I took leave of one another, he
being to go to Brampton (to settle things against my mother comes)
tomorrow morning.At noon my wife and I met at the Wardrobe, and there dined with the
children, and after dinner up to my Lady's bedside, and talked and laughed
a good while.Then my wife end I to Drury Lane to the French comedy,
which was so ill done, and the scenes and company and every thing else so
nasty and out of order and poor, that I was sick all the while in my mind
to be there.Here my wife met with a son of my Lord Somersett, whom she
knew in France, a pretty man; I showed him no great countenance, to avoyd
further acquaintance.That done, there being nothing pleasant but the
foolery of the farce, we went home.At home and the office all the morning, and at noon comes Luellin
to me, and he and I to the tavern and after that to Bartholomew fair, and
there upon his motion to a pitiful alehouse, where we had a dirty slut or
two come up that were whores, but my very heart went against them, so that
I took no pleasure but a great deal of trouble in being there and getting
from thence for fear of being seen.From hence he and I walked towards
Ludgate and parted.I back again to the fair all alone, and there met
with my Ladies Jemimah and Paulina, with Mr.Pickering and Madamoiselle,
at seeing the monkeys dance, which was much to see, when they could be
brought to do so, but it troubled me to sit among such nasty company.After that with them into Christ's Hospitall, and there Mr.Pickering
bought them some fairings, and I did give every one of them a bauble,
which was the little globes of glass with things hanging in them, which
pleased the ladies very well.After that home with them in their coach,
and there was called up to my Lady, and she would have me stay to talk
with her, which I did I think a full hour.And the poor lady did with so
much innocency tell me how Mrs.Crispe had told her that she did intend,
by means of a lady that lies at her house, to get the King to be godfather
to the young lady that she is in childbed now of; but to see in what a
manner my Lady told it me, protesting that she sweat in the very telling
of it, was the greatest pleasure to me in the world to see the simplicity
and harmlessness of a lady.Then down to supper with the ladies, and so
home, Mr.Moore (as he and I cannot easily part) leading me as far as
Fenchurch Street to the Mitre, where we drank a glass of wine and so
parted, and I home and to bed.My maid Jane newly gone, and Pall left now to do all
the work till another maid comes, which shall not be till she goes away
into the country with my mother.My Lord
Sandwich in the Straits and newly recovered of a great sickness at
Alicante.My father gone to settle at Brampton, and myself under much
business and trouble for to settle things in the estate to our content.But what is worst, I find myself lately too much given to seeing of plays,
and expense, and pleasure, which makes me forget my business, which I must
labour to amend.No money comes in, so that I have been forced to borrow
a great deal for my own expenses, and to furnish my father, to leave
things in order.I have some trouble about my brother Tom, who is now
left to keep my father's trade, in which I have great fears that he will
miscarry for want of brains and care.At Court things are in very ill
condition, there being so much emulacion, poverty, and the vices of
drinking, swearing, and loose amours, that I know not what will be the end
of it, but confusion.And the Clergy so high, that all people that I meet
with do protest against their practice.In short, I see no content or
satisfaction any where, in any one sort of people.The Benevolence

extracted honey, growing out of the ignorance of the public with regard to
this sweet, ignorance equaled only by the ignorance in regard to bees
themselves, that the sale of such honey has been very slow; so slow that
while my comb honey is reduced at this date to about 150 pounds, I have
several ten-gallon kegs of pure white honey still on hand.Especially is there a prejudice against candied honey, though that is an
absolute test of purity, and it can be readily liquified, as Mrs.When I say that it is an absolute test of purity I mean
that all honey that candies evenly is pure, though some of the best honey
I have ever had never candied at all.In one case I knew the honey to
candy in the combs of a new swarm early in autumn; but some seasons,
particularly very dry ones, it will hardly candy at all.This difference
seems to be due to the varying proportion of natural glucose, which will
crystallize, and levulose, or mellose, which will not crystallize.Manufactured glucose will not crystallize; and some of our largest honey
merchants, even the Thurbers, of New York, have mixed artificial glucose
with honey to avoid loss by the ignorant prejudice of the public.CAMM., MORGAN CO., ILL.South'n Wisconsin Bee-keepers' Ass'n.The bee-keepers met in Janesville, Wis., on the 4th inst., and organized a

Loaned netting investors 7 per cent.In a private letter to the editor of THE PRAIRIE FARMER Dr.L. S.
Pennington, of Whiteside County, Illinois, says: "Many thanks for your
instructive articles on Silk Culture.Could the many miles of Osage orange
found in this State be utilized for this purpose, the industry would give
employment to thousands of dependent women and children, by which means
they could make themselves, at least in part, self-supporting.I hope that
you will continue to publish and instruct your many readers on this
subject."Anent this subject we find the following by Prof.C. V. Riley in a late
issue of the American Naturalist:

"There is a strong disposition on the part of those who look for making
money by the propagation and sale of mulberry trees, to underrate the use
of Osage orange as silk-worm food.We have thoroughly demonstrated, by the
most careful tests, on several occasions, that when Maclura aurantiaca is
properly used for this purpose, the resulting silk loses nothing in
quantity or quality, and we have now a strain of Sericaria mori that has
been fed upon the plant for twelve consecutive years without
deterioration.There has been, perhaps, a slight loss of color which, if
anything, must be looked upon as an advantage.It is more than likely, how
ever, that the different races will differ in their adaptability to the
Maclura, and that for the first year the sudden transition to Maclura from
Morus, upon which the worms have been fed for centuries, may result in
some depreciation.Virion des Lauriers, at the silk farm at Genito,
has completed some experiments on the relative value of the two plants,
which he details in the opening number of the Silk-Grower's Guide and
Manufacturer's Gazette.The race
known as the "Var" was fed throughout on mulberry leaves.The "Pyrenean"
and "Cevennes" worms were fed throughout on leaves and branches of Osage
orange, while the "Milanese" worms were fed on Maclura up to the second
molt and then changed to mulberry leaves.At the close examples of each
variety of cocoons were sent to the Secretary of the Silk Board at Lyons,
and appraised by him The Maclura-fed cocoons were rated at 85 cents per
pound, those raised partly on Osage and partly on mulberry at 95 cents per
pound, and those fed entirely on mulberry at $1.11 per pound.des Lauriers thinks, seems to show that the difference between
Maclura and Morus as silk-worm food is some 'twenty-five to thirty per
cent in favor of the latter, while it is evident that the leaf of the
Osage orange can be used with some advantage during the first two ages of
the worms, thus allowing the mulberry tree to grow more leafy for feeding
during the last three ages.'The experiment, although interesting, is not
conclusive, from the simple fact that different races were used in the
different tests and not the same races, so that the result may have been
due, to a certain extent, to race and not to food."A writer in an English medical journal declares that the raising of the
head of the bed, by placing under each leg a block of the thickness of two
bricks, is an effective remedy for cramps.Patients who have suffered at
night, crying aloud with pain, have found this plan to afford immediate,
certain, and permanent relief.California stands fifth in the list of States in the manufacture of salt,
and is the only State in the Union where the distillation of salt from sea
water is carried on to any considerable extent.This industry has
increased rapidly during the last twenty years.The production has risen
from 44,000 bushels in 1860 to upwards of 880,000 bushels in 1883.The amount of attention given to purely technical education in Saxony is
shown by the fact that there are now in that kingdom the following
schools: A technical high school in Dresden, a technical State institute
at Chemnitz, and art schools in Dresden and Leipzig, also four builders'
schools, two for the manufacture of toys, six for shipbuilders, three for
basket weavers, and fourteen for lace making.Besides these there are the
following trade schools supported by different trades, foundations,
endowments, and districts: Two for decorative painting, one for
watchmakers, one for sheet metal workers, three for musical instrument
makers, one for druggists (not pharmacy), twenty-seven for weaving, one
for machine embroidery, two for tailors, one for barbers and hairdressers,
three for hand spinning, six for straw weaving, three for wood carving,
four for steam boiler heating, six for female handiwork.There are,
moreover, seventeen technical advanced schools, two for gardeners, eight
agricultural, and twenty-six commercial schools.The Patrie reports, with apparent faith, an invention of Dr.Raydt, of
Hanover, who claims to have developed fully the utility of carbonic acid
as a motive agent.Under the pressure of forty atmospheres this acid is
reduced to a liquid state, and when the pressure is removed it evaporates
and expands into a bulk 500 times as great as that it occupied before.It
is by means of this double process that the Hanoverian chemist proposes to
obtain such important benefits from the agent he employs.A quantity of
the fluid is liquified, and then stowed away in strong metal receptacles,
securely fastened and provided with a duct and valve.By opening the valve
free passage is given to the gas, which escapes with great force, and may
be used instead of steam for working in a piston.One of the principal
uses to which it has been put is to act as a temporary motive power for
fire engines.Iron cases of liquified carbonic acid are fitted on to the
boiler of the machine, and are always ready for use, so that while steam
is being got up, and the engines can not yet be regularly worked in the
usual way, the piston valves can be supplied with acid gas.There is,
however, another remarkable object to which the new agent can be directed,
and to which it has been recently applied in some experiments conducted at
Kiel.This is the floating of sunken vessels by means of artificial
bladders.It has been found that a bladder or balloon of twenty feet
diameter, filled with air, will raise a mass of over 100 tons.Hitherto
these floats have been distended by pumping air into them through pipes
from above by a cumbrous and tedious process, but Dr.Raydt merely affixes
a sufficient number of his iron gas-accumulators to the necks of the
floats to be used, and then by releasing the gas fills them at once with
the contents.DAIRY SUPPLIES, Etc.[Illustration of a swing churn]

[Illustration: HOUSEHOLD.]For nothing lovelier can be found
  In woman than to study _household_ good.--_Milton._


How He Ventilated the Cellar.The effect of foul air upon milk, cream, and butter was often alluded to
at the Dairymen's meeting at DeKalb.A great bane to the dairyman is
carbonic acid gas.In ill ventilated cellars it not only has a pernicious
effect upon milk and its products, but it often renders the living
apartments unhealthful, and brings disease and death to the family.W. D. Hoard, President of the Northwestern
Dairymen's Association, related the following incident showing how easily
cellars may be ventilated and rendered fit receptacles for articles of
food:

"In the city of Fort Atkinson, where I do reside, Mr.Clapp, the president
of the bank told me that for twenty years he had been unable to keep any
milk or butter or common food of the family in the cellar.I went and
looked at it, and saw gathered on the sleepers above large beads of
moisture, and then knew what was the matter.Wilkins is here and will tell you in a few
moments how to remedy this difficulty, and make your cellar a clean and
wholesome apartment of your house.'I went down and got the professor, and
he went up and looked at the cellar, and he says, 'for ten dollars I will
put you in possession of a cellar that will be clean and wholesome.'He
went to work and took a four-inch pipe, made of galvanized iron, soldered
tightly at the joints, passing it down the side of the cellar wall until
it came within two inches of the bottom of the cellar, turned a square
elbow at the top of the wall, carried it under the house, under the
kitchen, up through the kitchen floor and into the kitchen chimney, about
four feet above where the kitchen stovepipe entered.You know the kitchen
stove in all families is in operation about three times a day.The heat
from this kitchen stove acting on the column of air in that little pipe
caused a vacuum, and nature abhors a vacuum, and the result was that in
twenty-four hours that little pipe had drawn the entire foul air out of
the cellar, and he has now a perfect cellar.I drop this hint to show you
that it is within easy reach of every one, for the sum of only about ten
dollars, to have a perfectly ventilated cellar.This carbonic acid gas is
very heavy.It collects in the cellar and you can not get it out unless
you dip it out like water, or pump it out; and it becomes necessary to
apply something to it that shall operate in this way."This is a matter of such importance, and yet so little thought about, that
we had designed having an illustration made to accompany this article, but
conclude the arrangment is so simple that any one can go to work and adapt
it to the peculiar construction of his own house, and we hope thousands
will make use of Mr.As far as the nuptial ceremony itself was concerned, the Romans were in
the habit of celebrating it with many imposing rites and customs, some of
which are still in use in this country.As soon, therefore, as the
sooth-sayer had taken the necessary omens, the ceremony was commenced by a
sheep being sacrificed to Juno, under whose special guardianship marriage
was supposed to rest.The fleece was next laid upon two chairs, on which
the bride and bridegroom sat, over whom prayers were then said.At the
conclusion of the service the bride was led by three young men to the home
of her husband.She generally took with her a distaff and spindle filled
with wool, indicative of the first work in her new married life--spinning
fresh garments for her husband.The threshold of the house was gaily decorated with flowers and garlands;
and in order to keep out infection it was anointed with certain unctuous
perfumes.As a preservative, moreover, against sorcery and evil
influences, it was disenchanted by various charms.After being thus
prepared, the bride was lifted over the threshold, it being considered
unlucky for her to tread across it on first entering her husband's house.The musicians then struck up their music, and the company sang their
"Epithalamium."The keys of the house were then placed in the young wife's
hands, symbolic of her now being mistress.A cake, too, baked by the
vestal virgins, which had been carried before her in the procession from
the place of the marriage ceremony to the husband's home, was now divided
among the guests.To enhance the merriment of the festive occasion, the
bridegroom threw nuts among the boys, who then, as nowadays enjoyed
heartily a grand scramble.Once upon a time there lived a certain man and wife, and their name--well,
I think it must have been Smith, Mr.Smith said to her husband: "John, I really think we must
have the stove up in the sitting-room."Smith from behind his
newspaper answered "Well."Three hundred and forty-six times did Mr.Smith repeat this conversation, and the three hundred and
forty-seventh time Mr.Smith added: "I'll get Brown to help me about it
some day."It is uncertain how long the matter would have rested thus, had not Mrs.Smith crossed the street and asked neighbor Brown to come over and help
her husband set up a stove, and as she was not his wife he politely
consented and came at once.With a great deal of grunting, puffing, and banging, accompanied by some
words not usually mentioned in polite society, the two men at last got the
stove down from the attic.Smith had placed the zinc in its proper
position, and they put the stove way to one side of it, but of course that
didn't matter.Then they proceeded to put up the stovepipe.Smith pushed the knee
into the chimney, and Mr.The
next thing was to get the two pieces to come together.They pushed and
pulled, they yanked and wrenched, they rubbed off the blacking onto their
hands, they uttered remarks, wise and otherwise.Smith that a hammer was just the thing that
was needed, and he went for one.Brown improved the opportunity to
wipe the perspiration from his noble brow, totally oblivious of the fact
that he thereby ornamented his severe countenance with several landscapes
done in stove blacking.The hammer didn't seem to be just the thing that
was needed, after all.Smith pounded until he had spoiled the shape of
the stovepipe, and still the pesky thing wouldn't go in, so he became
exasperated and threw away the hammer.Brown's toe, and
that worthy man ejaculated--well, it's no matter what he ejaculated.Smith replied to his ejaculation, and then Mr.Smith, after making a
great deal of commotion, finally succeeded in getting the pipe into place,
that he was perfectly savage to everybody for the rest of the day, and
that the next time he and Brown met on the street both were looking
intently the other way.It came to pass in the course of the winter
that the pipe needed cleaning out.Smith dreaded the ordeal, both for
her own sake and her husband's.It happened that the kitchen was presided
over by that rarest of treasures, a good-natured, competent hired girl.This divinity proposed that they dispense with Mr.Smith's help in
cleaning out the pipe, and Mrs.Smith, with a sigh of relief, consented.They carefully pulled the pipe apart, and, holding the pieces in a
horizontal position that no soot might fall on the carpet, carried it into
the yard.After they had swept out the pipe and carried it back they attempted to
put it up.That must have been an unusually obstinate pipe, for it
steadily refused to go together.Smith and her housemaid
were sufficiently broad to grasp this fact after a few trials; therefore
they did not waste their strength in vain attempts, but rested, and in an
exceedingly un-masculine way held a consultation.The girl went for a
hammer, and brought also a bit of board.She placed this on the top of the
pipe, raised her hammer, Mrs.Smith held the pipe in place below, two
slight raps, and, lo, it was done.This story is true, with the exception of the
names and a few other unimportant items.I say, and will maintain it, that
as a general thing a woman has more brains and patience and less stupidity
than a man.I challenge any one to prove the contrary.--_N.In the course of a lecture on the resources of New Brunswick, Professor
Brown, of the Ontario Agricultural College, told the following story by an
Arabian writer:

"I passed one day by a very rude and beautifully situated hamlet in a vast
forest, and asked a savage whom I saw how long it had been there.'It is
indeed an old place,' replied he.'We know it has stood there for 100 years
as the hunting home of the great St.John, but how long previous to that
we do not know.'"One century afterward, as I passed by the same place, I found a busy
little city reaching down to the sea, where ships were loading timber for
distant lands.On asking one of the inhabitants how long this had
flourished, he replied: 'I am looking to the future years, and not to what
has gone past, and have no time to answer such questions.'"On my return there 100 years afterward, I found a very smoky and
wonderfully-populous city, with many tall chimneys, and asked one of the
inhabitants how long it had been founded.'It is indeed a mighty city,'
replied he.'We know not how long it has existed, and our ancestors there
on this subject are as ignorant as ourselves.'"Another century after that as I passed by the same place, I found a much
greater city than before, but could not see the tall chimneys, and the air
was pure as crystal; the country to the north and the east and the west,
was covered with noble mansions and great farms, full of many cattle and
sheep.I demanded of a peasant, who was reaping grain on the sands of the
sea-shore, how long ago this change took place?'In sooth, a strange
question!''This ground and city have never been different
from what you now behold them.''Were there not of old,' said I,'many
great manufacturers in this city?''Never,' answered he,'so far as we
have seen, and never did our fathers speak to us of any such.'"On my return there, 100 years afterward, I found the city was built
across the sea east-ward into the opposite country; there were no horses,
and no smoke of any kind came from the dwellings."The inhabitants were traveling through the air on wires which stretched
far into the country on every side, and the whole land was covered with
many mighty trees and great vineyards, so that the noble mansions could
not be seen for the magnitude of the fruit thereof."Lastly, on coming back again, after an equal lapse of time, I could not
perceive the slightest vestige of the city.I inquired of a very old and
saintly man, who appeared to be under deep emotion, and who stood alone
upon the spot, how long it had been destroyed.'Is this a question,' said
he, 'from a man like you?Know ye not that cities are not now part of the
human economy?Every one travels through the air on wings of electricity,
and lives in separate dwellings scattered all over the land; the ships of
the sea are driven by the same power, and go above or below as found to be
best for them.In the cultivation of the soil,' said he, 'neither horse
nor steam-power are employed; the plow is not known, nor are fertilizers
of any more value in growing the crops of the field.Electricity is
carried under the surface of every farm and all over-head like a net; when
the inhabitants require rain for any particular purpose, it is drawn down
from the heavens by similar means.The influence of electricity has
destroyed all evil things, and removed all diseases from among men and
beasts, and every living thing upon the earth.All things have changed,
and what was once the noble city of my name is to become the great meeting
place of all the leaders of science throughout the whole world.'"Gunkettle, as she spanked the baby in her calm, motherly
way, "it's a perfect shame, Mr.G., that you never bring me home anything
to read!I might as well be shut up in a lunatic asylum.""I think so, too," responded the unfeeling man.Gunkettle, as she gave the baby a marble to
swallow, to stop its noise, "have magazines till they can't rest.""Oh, yes; a horrid old report of the fruit interests of Michigan; lots of
news in that!"and she sat down on the baby with renewed vigor."I'm sure it's plum full of currant news of the latest dates," said the
miserable man.Gunkettle retorted that she wouldn't give a fig for a
whole library of such reading, when 'apple-ly the baby shrieked loud
enough to drown all other sounds, and peace was at once restored.Mouce Traps and Other Sweetemetes.The following advertisement is copied from the Fairfield Gazette of

  A SONNET ON A BONNET.A film of lace and a droop of feather,
  With sky-blue ribbons to knot them together;
  A facing (at times) of bronze-brown tresses,
  Into whose splendor each furbelow presses;
  Two strings of blue to fall in a tangle,
  And chain of pink chin In decorous angle;
  The tip of the plume right artfully twining
  Where a firm neck steals under the lining;
  And the curls and braids, the plume and the laces.Circle about the shyest of faces,
  Bonnet there is not frames dimples sweeter!Bonnet there is not that shades eyes completer!Fated is he that but glances upon it,
  Sighing to dream of that face in the bonnet.--_Winnifred Wise Jenks._

  LITTLE DILLY-DALLY.I don't believe you ever
   Knew any one so silly
  As the girl I'm going to tell about--
   A little girl named Dilly,
     Dilly-dally Dilly,
      Oh, she is very slow,
     She drags her feet
     Along the street,
      And dilly-dallies so!She's always late to breakfast
   Without a bit of reason,
  For Bridget rings and rings the bell
   And wakes her up in season.Dilly-dally Dilly,
      How can you be so slow?Why don't you try
     To be more spry,
      And not dilly-dally so?'Tis just the same at evening;
   And it's really quite distressing
  To see the time that Dilly wastes
   In dreaming and undressing.Dilly-dally Dilly
      Is always in a huff;
     If you hurry her
     Or worry her
      She says, "There's time enough."Since she's neither sick nor helpless,
   It is quite a serious matter
  That she should be so lazy that
   We still keep scolding at her.Dilly-dally Dilly,
      It's very wrong you know,
     To do no work
     That you can shirk,
      And dilly-dally so.Old "Uncle Jim," of Stonington, Conn., ought to have a whole drawer to
himself, for nothing short of it could express the easy-going enlargement
of his mind in narratives.Uncle Jim was a retired sea captain, sealer,
and whaler, universally beloved and respected for his lovely disposition
and genuine good-heartedness, not less than for the moderation of his
statements and the truthful candor of his narrations.It happened that one
of the Yale Professors, who devoted himself to ethnological studies, was
interested in the Patagonians, and very much desired information as to the
alleged gigantic stature of the race.A scientific friend, who knew the
Stonington romancer, told the Professor that he could no doubt get
valuable information from Uncle Jim, a Captain who was familiar with all
the region about Cape Horn.And the Professor, without any hint about
Uncle Jim's real ability, eagerly accompanied his friend to make the
visit.Uncle Jim was found in one of his usual haunts, and something like
the following ethnological conversation ensued:

Professor--They tell me, Capt.Pennington, that you have been a good deal
in Patagonia.Uncle Jim--Made thirty or forty voyages there, sir.Professor--And I suppose you know something about the Patagonians and
their habits?Uncle Jim--Know all about 'em, sir.Know the Patagonians, sir, all, all of
'em, as well as I know the Stonington folks.Professor--I wanted to ask you, Captain, about the size of the
Patagonians--whether they are giants, as travelers have reported?Uncle Jim--No, sir--shaking his head slowly, and speaking with the modest
tone of indifference--no, sir, they are not.(It was quite probable that
the Captain never had heard the suggestion before).The height of the
Patagonian, sir, is just five feet nine inches and a half.Professor--How did you ascertain this fact, Captain?Uncle Jim--Measured 'em, sir--measured 'em.One day when the mate and I
were ashore down there, I called up a lot of the Patagonians, and the mate
and I measured about 500 of them, and every one of them measured five feet
nine inches and a half--that's their exact height.But, Captain, don't you suppose there
were giants there long ago, in the former generations?Uncle Jim--Not a word of truth in it, sir--not a word.I'd heard that
story and I thought I'd settle it.I satisfied myself there was nothing in
it.Professor--But how could you know that they used not to be giants?Mightn't the former race have been giants?Uncle Jim--Impossible, sir, impossible.Uncle Jim--Dug 'em up, sir--dug 'em up speaking with more than usual
moderation.The next voyage, I took the bo'sen and
went ashore; we dug up 275 old Patagonians and measured 'em.They all
measured exactly five feet nine inches and a half; no difference in
'em--men, women, and all ages just the same.Five feet nine inches and a
half is the natural height of a Patagonian.Not a word of truth in the stories about giants, sir.--_Harper's
Magazine_."Nice child, very nice child," observed an old gentleman, crossing the
aisle and addressing the mother of the boy who had just hit him in the eye
with a wad of paper."None of your business," replied the youngster, taking aim at another
passenger."Fine boy," smiled the old man, as the parent regarded her offspring with
pride.shouted the youngster, with a giggle at his own wit."I thought so," continued the old man, pleasantly."If you had given me
three guesses at it, that would have been the first one I would have
struck on.Now, Puddin', you can blow those things pretty straight, can't
you?"squealed the boy, delighted at the compliment."See me take
that old fellow over there!""Try it on the old woman I
was sitting with.She has boys of her own, and she won't mind.""Can you hit the lady for the gentleman, Johnny?"Johnny drew a bead and landed the pellet on the end of the old woman's
nose.But she did mind it, and, rising in her wrath, soared down on the
small boy like a blizzard.She put him over the line, reversed him, ran
him backward till he didn't know which end of him was front, and finally
dropped him into the lap of the scared mother, with a benediction whereof
the purport was that she'd be back in a moment and skin him alive."She didn't seem to like it, Puddin'," smiled the gentleman, softly."She's a perfect stranger to me, but I understand she is a matron of
truants' home, and I thought she would like a little fun; but I was
mistaken."And the old gentleman sighed sweetly as he went back to his seat.The discovery of the alphabet is at once the triumph, the instrument and
the register of the progress of our race.The oldest abecedarium in
existence is a child's alphabet on a little ink-bottle of black ware found
on the site of Cere, one of the oldest of the Greek settlements in Central
Italy, certainly older than the end of the sixth century B. C. The
Phoenician alphabet has been reconstructed from several hundred
inscriptions.The "Moabite Stone" has yielded the honor of being the most
ancient of alphabetic records to the bronze plates found in Lebanon in
1872, fixed as of the tenth or eleventh century, and therefore the
earliest extant monuments of the Semitic alphabet.The lions of Nineveh
and an inscribed scarab found at Khorsabad have furnished other early
alphabets; while scarabs and cylinders, seals and gems, from Babylon and
Nineveh, with some inscriptions, are the scanty records of the first epoch
of the Phoenician alphabet.For the second period, a sarcophagus found in
1855, with an inscription of twenty-two lines, has tasked the skill of
more than forty of the most eminent Semitic scholars of the day, and the
literature connected with it is overwhelming.An unbroken series of coins
extending over seven centuries from 522 B. C. to 153 A. D., Hebrew
engraved gems, the Siloam inscription discovered in Jerusalem in 1880,
early Jewish coins, have each and all found special students whose
successive progress is fully detailed by Taylor.The Aramaean alphabet
lived only for seven or eight centuries; but from it sprang the scripts of
five great faiths of Asia and the three great literary alphabets of the
East.Nineveh and its public records supply most curious revelations of
the social life and commercial transactions of those primitive times.Loans, leases, notes, sales of houses, slaves, etc., all dated, show the
development of the alphabet.The early Egyptian inscriptions show which
alphabet was there in the reign of Xerxes.Fragments on stone preserved in
old Roman walls in Great Britain, Spain, France, and Jerusalem, all supply
early alphabets.Alphabets have been affected by religious controversies, spread by
missionaries, and preserved in distant regions by holy faith, in spite of
persecution and perversion.The Arabic alphabet, next in importance after
the great Latin alphabet, followed in eighty years the widespread religion
of Mohammed; and now the few Englishmen who can read and speak it are
astonished to learn that it is collaterally related to our own alphabet,
and that both can be traced back to the primitive Phoenician source.Greece alone had forty local alphabets, reduced by careful study to about
half a dozen generic groups, characterized by certain common local
features, and also by political connection.Of the oldest "a, b, c's" found in Italy, several were scribbled by
school-boys on Pompeian walls, six in Greek, four in Oscan, four in Latin;
others were scratched on children's cups, buried with them in their
graves, or cut or painted for practice on unused portions of mortuary
slabs.The earliest was found as late as 1882, a plain vase of black ware
with an Etruscan inscription and a syllabary or spelling exercise, and the
Greek alphabet twice repeated."Pa, I have signed the pledge," said a little boy to his father, on coming
home one evening; "will you help me keep it?""Well, I have brought a copy of the pledge; will you sign it, papa?"What could I do when my brother-officers
called--the father had been in the army--if I was a teetotaler?""Well, you won't ask me to pass the bottle, papa?""You are quite a fanatic, my child; but I promise not to ask you to touch
it."Some weeks after that two officers called in to spend the evening."Have you any more of that prime Scotch ale?""No," said he; "I have not, but I shall get some.Here, Willie, run to the
store, and tell them to send some bottles up."The boy stood before his father respectfully, but did not go."Come, Willie; why, what's the matter?He went, but came
back presently without any bottles."I asked them for it at the store, and they put it upon the counter, but I
could not touch it.don't be angry; I told them to send it up,
but I could not touch it myself!"The father was deeply moved, and turning to his brother-officers, he said:

"Gentlemen, do you hear that?When the ale comes
you may drink it, but not another drop shall be drank in my house, and not
another drop shall pass my lips.Willie, have you your temperance pledge?"And the boy was back with it in a moment.The father signed it and the
little fellow clung round his father's neck with delight.The ale came,
but not one drank, and the bottles stood on the table untouched.Children, sign the pledge, and ask your parents to help you keep it.Don't
touch the bottle, and try to keep others from touching it.Stock Farms FOR SALE; one of the very best in Central Illinois, the

THE PRAIRIE FARMER is the Cheapest and Best Agricultural Paper published.He owned the farm--at least 'twas thought
   He owned, since he lived upon it,--
  And when he came there, with him brought
   The men whom he had hired to run it.He had been bred to city life
   And had acquired a little money;
  But, strange conceit, himself and wife
   Thought farming must be something funny.He did not work himself at all,
   But spent his time in recreation--
  In pitching quoits and playing ball,
   And such mild forms of dissipation.He kept his "rods" and trolling spoons,
   His guns and dogs of various habits,--
  While in the fall he hunted <DW53>s,
   And in the winter skunks and rabbits.His hired help were quick to learn
   The liberties that might be taken,
  And through the season scarce would earn
   The salt it took to save their bacon.He knew no more than child unborn,
   One-half the time, what they were doing,--
  Whether they stuck to hoeing corn,
   Or had on hand some mischief brewing.His crops, although they were but few,
   With proper food were seldom nourished,
  While cockle instead of barley grew,
   And noxious weeds and thistles flourished.His cows in spring looked more like rails
   Set up on legs, than living cattle;
  And when they switched their dried-up tails
   The very bones in them would rattle.At length the sheriff came along,
   Who soon relieved him of his labors.While he became the jest and song
   Of his more enterprising neighbors.Back to the place where life began,
   Back to the home from whence he wandered,
  A sadder, if not a wiser man,
   He went with all his money squandered.On any soil, be it loam or clay,
   Mellow and light, or rough and stony,
  Those men who best make farming pay
   Find use for brains as well as money._--Tribune and Farmer._


FRANK DOBB'S WIVES."The great trouble with my son," old Dobb observed to me once, "is that he
is a genius."And the old gentleman sighed and looked with melancholy eyes at the
picture on the genius's easel.It was a clever picture, but everything
Frank Dobb did was clever, from his painting to his banjo playing.Clever
was the true name for it, for of substantial merit it possessed none.He
had begun to paint without learning to draw, and he could pick a tune out
of any musical instrument extant without ever having mastered the
mysteries of notes.He talked the most graceful of airy nothings, and
could not cover a page of note paper without his orthography going lame,
and all the rest of his small acquirements and accomplishments were
proportionately shallow and incomplete.Paternal partiality laid it to his
being too gifted to study, but the cold logic, which no ties of
consanguinity influenced, ascribed it to laziness.Frank was, indeed, the idlest and best-natured fellow in the world.You
never saw him busy, angry, or out of spirits.He painted a little,
thrummed his guitar a little longer or rattled a tune off on his piano,
smoked and read a great deal, and flirted still more, all in the same
deliberate and easy-going way.Any excuse was sufficient to absolve him
from serious work.So he lead a pleasant, useless life, with Dobb senior
to pay the bills.He had the handsomest studio in New York, a studio for one of Ouida's
heroes to luxuriate in.If the encouragement of picturesque surroundings
could have made a painter of him he would have been a master.The fame of
his studio, and the fact that he did not need the money, made his pictures
sell.He was quite a lion in society, and it was regarded as a favor to be
asked to call on him.He was the beau ideal of the artist of romance, and
was accorded a romantic eminence accordingly.So, with his pictures to
provide him with pocket money, and his father to see to the rest, he lived
the life of a young prince, feted and flattered and spoiled, artistically
despised by all the serious workers who knew him, and hated by some who
envied him the commercial success he had no necessity for, but esteemed by
most of us as a good fellow and his own worst enemy.Frank married his first wife while Dobb senior was still at the helm of
his own affairs.She was a charming little woman whose acquaintance he had
made when she visited his studio with a party of friends.She had not a
penny, but he made a draft upon "the governor," as he called him, and the
happy pair digested their honeymoon in Europe.They were absent six
months, during which time he did not set brush to canvas.Then they
returned, as he fancifully termed it, to go to work.He commenced the old life as if he had never been married.The familiar
sound of pipes and beer, and supper after the play, often with young
ladies who had been assisting in the representation on the stage, was
traveled as if there had been no Mrs.Dobb at home in the flat old Dobb
provided.Frank's expenditures on himself were as lavish as they had been
in his bachelor days.As little Brown said, it was lucky that Mrs.Dobb
had a father-in-law to buy her dinner for her.She rarely came to her
husband's studio, because he claimed that it interfered with the course of
business.He had invented a fiction that she was too weak to endure the
strain of society, and so he took her into it as little as possible.In
brief, married by the caprice of a selfish man, the poor little woman
lived through a couple of neglected years, and then died of a malady as
nearly akin to a broken heart as I can think of, while Frank was making a
trip to the Bahamas on the yacht of his friend Munnybagge, of the Stock
Exchange.He had set out on the voyage ostensibly to make studies, for he was a
marine painter, on the principle, probably, that marines are easiest to
paint.When he came back and found his wife dead, he announced that he
would move his studio to Havana for the purpose of improving his art.He
did so, putting off his mourning suit the day after he left New York and
not putting it on again, as the evidence of creditable witnesses on the
steamer and in Havana has long since proved.His son's callousness was a savage stab in old Dobb's heart.A little,
mild-looking old gentleman, without a taint of selfishness or suspicion in
his own nature, he had not seen the effect of his indulgence of him on his
son till his brutal disregard for his first duty as a man had told him of
it.The old man had appreciated and loved his daughter-in-law.In
proportion as he had discovered her unhappiness and its just cause, he had
lost his affection for his son.I hear that there was a terrible scene
when Frank came home, a week after his wife had been buried.He claimed to
have missed the telegram announcing her death to him at Nassau, but
Munnybagge had already told some friends that he had got the dispatch in
time for the steamer, but had remained over till the next one, because he
had a flirtation on hand with little Gonzales, the Cuban heiress, and old
Dobb had heard of it.Munnybagge never took him yachting again; and,
speaking to me once about him, he designated him, not by name, but as
"that infernal bloodless cad."However, as I have said, there was a desperate row between father and son,
and Frank is said to have slunk out of the house like a whipped cur, and
been quite dull company at the supper which he took after the opera that
night in Gillian Trussell's jolly Bohemian flat.When he emigrated, with
his studio traps filling half a dozen packing cases, none of the boys
bothered to see him off.They had learned to see through his good
fellowship, and recalled a poor little phantom, to whose life and
happiness he had been a wicked and bitter enemy.About a year after his departure I read the announcement in the Herald of
the marriage of Franklin D. Dobb, Sr., to a widow well-known and popular
in society.I took the trouble to ascertain that it was Frank's father,
and being among some of the boys that night, mentioned it to them."Well," remarked Smith, "that's really queer.You remember Frank left some
things in my care when he went away?Yesterday I got a letter asking about
them, and informing me that he had got married and was coming home."He did come home, and he settled in his old studio.What sort of a meeting
he had with his father this time I never heard.The old gentleman had been
paying him his allowance regularly while he was away, and I believe he
kept up the payment still.But otherwise he gave him no help, and if he
ever needed help he did now.His wife was a Cuban, as pretty and as helpless as a doll.She had been an
heiress till her brother had turned rebel and had his property
confiscated.Unfortunately for Frank, he had married her before the
culmination of this catastrophe.In fact, he had been paying court to her
with the dispatch announcing his wife's death in his pocket, and had
married her long before the poor little clay was well settled in the grave
he had sent it to.In marrying her he had evidently believed he was
establishing his future.So he was, but it was a future of expiation for
the sins and omissions of his past.Dobb was a tigress in her love and her jealousy.She was
childish and ignorant, and adored her husband as a man and an artist.She
measured his value by her estimation of him, and was on the watch
perpetually for trespassers on her domain.The domestic outbreaks between
the two were positively blood curdling.One afternoon, I remember, Gillian
Trussell, who had heard of his return, called on him.D. met her at
the studio door, told her, "Frank," as she called him, was out; slammed
the door in her face, and then flew at him with a palette scraper.We had
to break the door in, and found him holding her off by both wrists, and
she frothing in a mad fit of hysterics.From that day he was a changed
man.The life the pair lived after that was simply ridiculously miserable.He
had lost his old social popularity, and was forced to sell his pictures to
the cheap dealers, when he was lucky enough to sell them at all.The
paternal allowance would not support the flat they first occupied, and
they went into a boarding house.Inside of a month they were in the
papers, on account of outbreaks on Mrs.Dobb's part against one of the
ladies of the house.A couple of days after he leased a little room
opening into his studio, converted it into a bed-room, and they settled
there for good.Such a housekeeping as it was--like a scene in a farce.The studio had
long since run to seed, and a perpetual odor of something to eat hung over
it along with the sickening reek of the Florida water Mrs.D., like all
other creoles, made more liberal use of than of the pure element it was
half-named from.Crumbs and crusts and chop-bones, which the dog had left,
littered the rugs; and I can not recall the occasion on which the
caterer's tin box was not standing at the door, unless it was when the
dirty plates were piled up, there waiting for him to come for them.Frank had had a savage quarrel with her that day, and
wanted me for a <DW12>.But the scheme availed him nothing, for she broke
out over the soup and I left them to fight it out, and finished my feast
at a chop house.All of his old flirtations came back to curse him now.His light loves of
the playhouse and his innocent devotions of the ball room were alike the
instruments fate had forged into those of punishment for him.The very
names of his old fancies, which, with that subtle instinct all women
possess, she had found out, were sufficient to send his wife into a
frenzy.She was a chronic theatre-goer, and they never went to the theatre
without bringing a quarrel home with them.If he was silent at the play
she charged him with neglecting her; if he brisked up and tried to chat,
her jealousy would soon pick out some casus belli in the small talk he
strove to interest her with.A word to a passing friend, a glance at one
of her own sex, was sufficient to set her going.I shall never question
that jealousy is a form of actual madness, after what I saw of it in the
lives of that miserable man and woman.A year after his return he was the ghost of his old self.He was haggard
and often unshaven; his attire was shabby and carelessly put on; he had
lost his old, jaunty air, and went by you with a hurried pace, and his
head and shoulders bent with an indescribable suggestion of humility.The
fear of having her break out, regardless of any one who might be by, which
hung over him at home, haunted him out of doors, too.Dobb the first had broken his spirit as effectually as he had broken Mrs.Smith occupied the next studio to him, and one evening I was
smoking there, when an atrocious uproar commenced in the next room.We
could distinguish Frank's voice and his wife's, and another strange one.Smith looked at me, grinned, and shrugged his shoulders.The disturbance
ceased in a couple of minutes, and a door banged.Then came a crash, a shrill and furious scream, and the sound of feet.We
ran to the door, in time to see Mrs.Dobb, her hair in a tangle down her
back, in a dirty wrapper and slipshod slippers, stumbling down stairs.We
posted after her, Smith nearly breaking his neck by tripping over one of
the slippers which she had shed as she ran.The theatres were just out and
the streets full of people, among whom she jostled her way like the mad
woman that she was.We came up with her as she overtook her husband, who
was walking with McGilp, the dealer who handled his pictures.She seized
him by the arm and screamed out:

"I told you I would come with you."His face for a moment was the face of a devil, full of fury and despair.I
saw his fist clench itself and the big vein in his forehead swell.But he
slipped his hands into his pockets, looked appealingly at McGilp, and
said, shrugging his shoulders, "You see how it is, Mac?"McGilp nodded and walked abruptly away, with a look full of contempt and
scorn.We mingled with the crowd and saw the poor wretches go off
together, he grim and silent, she hysterically excited--with all the world
staring at them.Smith slept on a lounge in my room that night."I
couldn't get a wink up there," he said, "and I don't want to be even the
ear witness of a murder."The night did not witness the tragedy he anticipated, though.Next day,
Frank Dobb came to see me--a compliment he had not paid me for months.He
was the incarnation of abject misery, and so nervous that he could
scarcely speak intelligibly."I saw you in the crowd last night, old man," he said, looking at the
floor and twisting and untwisting his fingers.A
nice life for a fellow to lead, eh?"What else could I reply than, "Why do you lead it then?"he repeated, breaking into a hollow, uneasy laugh."Why, because I
love her, damn me!"Is this what you came to tell me?""No," he answered, "of course not.The fact is, I want you to help me out
of a hole.That row last night has settled me with McGilp.He came to see
me about a lot of pictures for a sale he is getting up out West, and the
senora kept up such a nagging that he got sick and suggested that we
should go to 'The Studio' for a chop and settle the business there.She
swore I shouldn't go, and that she would follow us if I did.I thought
she'd not go that far; but she did.So the McGilp affair is off for good,
I know.He's disgusted, and I don't blame him.Buy that Hoguet you wanted last year."The picture was one I had fancied and offered him a price for in his palmy
days, one that he had picked up abroad.I was only too glad to take it and
a couple more, for which I paid him at once; and next evening, at dinner,
I heard that he had levanted."Walked out this morning," said Smith, "and
sent a messenger an hour after with word that he had already left the
city.She came in to me with the letter in one hand and a dagger in the
other.She swears he has run away with another woman, and says she's going
to have her life, if she has to follow her around the world."She did not carry out her sanguinary purpose, though.There were some
consultations with old Dobb and then the studio was to let again.Some one
told me she had returned to Cuba, where she proposed to live on the
allowance her father-in-law had made her husband and which he now
continued to her.I had almost forgotten her when, several years later, in the lobby of the
Academy of Music, she touched my arm with her fan.She was promenading on
the arm of a handsome but beefy-looking Englishman, whom she introduced to
me as her husband.I had not heard of a divorce, but I took the
introduction as information that there had been one.The Englishman was a
better fellow than he looked.We supped together after the opera, and I
learned that he had met Mrs.Dobb in Havana, where he had spent some years
in business.I found her a changed woman--a new woman, indeed, in whom I
only now and then caught a glimpse of her old indolent, babyish and
foolish self.She was not only prettier than ever, but she had become a
sensible and clever woman.The influence of an intelligent man, who was
strong enough to bend her to his ways, had developed her latent brightness
and taught her to respect herself as well as him.I met her several times after that, and at the last meeting but one she
spoke of Frank for the first time.Her black eyes snapped when she uttered
his name.The devil was alive in them, though love was dead.I told her that I had heard nothing of him since his disappearance."But I have," she said, showing her white teeth in a curious smile.she went on bitterly; "and to think I could ever have loved
such a thing as he!X., that I never knew he had been
married till after he had fled?Then his father told me how he had courted
my father's money, with his wife lying dead at home.Before I heard that, I wanted to kill the woman who had
stolen you from me.The moment after I could have struck you dead at my
feet."She threw her arm up, holding her fan like a dagger.I believed her, and
so would any one who had seen her then."I had hardly settled in Havana," she continued, "before I received a
letter from him.Had the other woman
tired of him already?I asked myself, or was it really true, as his father
had told me, that he had fled alone?I answered the letter, and he wrote
again.Again I answered, and so it was kept up.For two years I played
with the love I now knew was worthless.He was traveling round the world,
and a dozen times wanted to come directly to me.I insisted that he should
keep his journey up--as a probation, you see.The exultation with which she told this was absolutely fiendish.I could
see in it, plainer than any words could tell it to me, the scheme of
vengeance she had carried out, the alternating hopes and torments to which
she had raised, and into which she had plunged him.I could see him
wandering around the globe, scourged by remorses, agonized by doubts, and
maddened by despairs, accepting the lies she wrote him as inviolable
pledges, and sustaining himself with the vision of a future never to be
fulfilled.She read the expression of my face, and laughed.And again she stabbed the air with her fan."But--pardon me the question--but you have begun the confidence," I said."I had been divorced while I was writing to him.A year ago he was to be
in London, where I was to meet him.While he was sailing from the Cape of
Good Hope I was being married to a man who loved me for myself, and to
whom I had confided all.Instead of my address at the London post office
he received a notification of my marriage, addressed to him in my own hand
and mailed to him by myself.He wrote once or twice still, but my husband
indorsed the letters with his own name and returned them unopened.He may
be dead for all I know, but I hope and pray he is still alive, and will
remain alive and love me for a thousand years."She opened her arms, as if to hug her vengeance to her heart, and looked
at me steadily with eyes that thrilled me with their lambent fire.No
wonder the wretched vagabond loved her!What a doom his selfishness and
his duplicity had invoked upon him!I believe if he could have seen her as
I saw her then, so different from and better than he knew her to be, he
would have gone mad on the spot.Dobb the first was indeed
avenged.We sipped our chocolate and talked of other things, as if such a being as
Frank Dobb had never been.Her husband joined us and we made an evening of
it at the theatre.I knew from the way he looked at me, and from the
increased warmth of his manner, that he was conversant with his wife's
having made a confidant of me.But I do not think he knew how far her
confidence had gone.I have often wondered since if he knew how deep and
fierce the hatred she carried for his predecessor was.There are things
women will reveal to strangers which they will die rather than divulge to
those they love.I saw them off to Europe, for they were going to establish themselves in
London, and I have never seen or directly heard from them since.But some
months after their departure I received a letter from Robinson, who has
been painting there ever since his picture made that great hit in the
Salon of '7--."I have odd news for you," he wrote."You remember Frank Dobb, who
belonged to our old Pen and Pencil Club, and who ran away from that Cuban
wife of his just before I left home?Well, about a year ago I met him in
Fleet street, the shabbiest beggar you ever saw.He was quite tight and
smelled of gin across the street.He was taking a couple of drawings to a
penny dreadful office which he was making pictures for at ten shillings a
piece.I went to see him once, in the dismalest street back of Drury Lane.He was doing some painting for a dealer, when he was sober enough, and of
all the holes you ever saw his was it.I soon had to sit down on him, for
he got into the habit of coming to see me and loafing around, making the
studio smell like a pub, till I would lend him five shillings to go away.I heard nothing of him till the other day I came across an event which
this from the Telegraph will explain."The following newspaper paragraph was appended:

"The man who shot himself on the door-step of Mr.Bennerley Green, the
West India merchant, last Monday, has been discovered to be an American
who for some time has been employed furnishing illustrations to the lower
order of publications here.He was known as Allan, but this is said to
have been an assumed name.He is stated to be the son of a wealthy New
Yorker, who discarded him in consequence of his habits of dissipation, and
to have once been an artist of considerable prominence in the United
States.All that is known of the suicide is the story told by the servant,
who a few minutes after admitting his master and mistress upon their
return from the theatre, heard the report of a pistol in the street, and
on opening the door found the wretched man dead upon the step.The body
was buried after the inquest at the charge of the eminent American artist,
Mr.J. J. Robinson, A. R. A., who had known him in his better days."Bennerley Green, the West

It is the best wheat I ever raised or saw.I sowed one quart and got from
it three bushels of beautiful wheat weighing 63 pounds to the bushel,
which took the first premium at our county fair.I have been offered $15 a
bushel for my seed, but would not part with a handful of it.If I could
not get more like it, I would not sell the three bushels I raised from the
quart for $100.STEABNER, Sorlien's Mill, Yellow Medicine Co., Minn.Farmers, if you want to know more of this wheat, write to

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Prairie Farmer, Vol."You don't expect US to carry it, do you?"The Superintendent settled the difficulty temporarily by informing them
that the baby could not possibly leave the home until the mother had
signed the necessary papers for its release."I thought all those details had been attended to," said Aggie, and
again the two women surveyed Jimmy with grieved disappointment."I'll get the mother's signature the first thing in the morning,"
volunteered the Superintendent."Very well," said Zoie, "and in the meantime, I'll send some new clothes
for it," and with a lofty farewell to the Superintendent, she and Aggie
followed Jimmy down stairs to the taxi."Now," said Zoie, when they were properly seated, "let's stop at a
telegraph office and let Jimmy send a wire to Alfred.""Wait until we get the baby," cautioned Aggie."We'll have it the first thing in the morning," argued Zoie."Jimmy can send him a night-letter," compromised Aggie, "that way Alfred
won't get the news until morning."A few minutes later, the taxi stopped in front of Jimmy's office and
with a sigh of thanksgiving he hurried upstairs to his unanswered mail.CHAPTER XIII

When Alfred Hardy found himself on the train bound for Detroit, he tried
to assure himself that he had done the right thing in breaking away
from an association that had kept him for months in a constant state of
ferment.Having settled this
point to his temporary satisfaction, he opened his afternoon paper
and leaned back in his seat, meaning to divert his mind from personal
matters, by learning what was going on in the world at large.No sooner had his eye scanned the first headline than he was startled by
a boisterous greeting from a fellow traveller, who was just passing down
the aisle."Detroit," answered Alfred, annoyed by the sudden interruption."THAT'S a funny thing," declared the convivial spirit, not guessing how
funny it really was."You know," he continued, so loud that everyone in
the vicinity could not fail to hear him, "the last time I met you two,
you were on your honeymoon--on THIS VERY TRAIN," and with that the
fellow sat himself down, uninvited, by Alfred's side and started on a
long list of compliments about "the fine little girl" who had in his
opinion done Alfred a great favour when she consented to tie herself to
a "dull, money-grubbing chap" like him."So," thought Alfred, "this is the way the world sees us."And he began
to frame inaudible but desperate defences of himself.Again he told
himself that he was right; but his friend's thoughtless words had
planted an uncomfortable doubt in his mind, and when he left the
train to drive to his hotel, he was thinking very little about the new
business relations upon which he was entering in Detroit, and very much
about the domestic relations which he had just severed in Chicago.Had he been merely a "dull money-grubber"?Had he left his wife too much
alone?Was she not a mere child when he married her?Could he not, with
more consideration, have made of her a more understanding companion?These were questions that were still unanswered in his mind when he
arrived at one of Detroit's most enterprising hotels.But later, having telephoned to his office and found that several
matters of importance were awaiting his decision, he forced himself to
enter immediately upon his business obligations.As might have been expected, Alfred soon won the respect and serious
consideration of most of his new business associates, and this in a
measure so mollified his hurt pride, that upon rare occasions he was
affable enough to accept the hospitality of their homes.But each
excursion that he made into the social life of these new friends, only
served to remind him of the unsettled state of his domestic affairs.his hostess would remark before they were
fairly seated at table."They tell me she is so pretty," his vis-a-vis would exclaim.Then his host would laugh and tell the "dear ladies" that in HIS
opinion, Alfred was afraid to bring his wife to Detroit, lest he might
lose her to a handsomer man.Alfred could never quite understand why remarks such as this annoyed him
almost to the point of declaring the whole truth.His LEAVING Zoie, and
his "losing" her, as these would-be comedians expressed it, were
two separate and distinct things in his mind, and he felt an almost
irresistible desire to make this plain to all concerned.But no sooner did he open his lips to do so, than a picture of Zoie in
all her child-like pleading loveliness, arose to dissuade him.He could
imagine his dinner companions all pretending to sympathise with him,
while they flayed poor Zoie alive.She would never have another chance
to be known as a respectable woman, and compared to most women of
his acquaintance, she WAS a respectable woman.True, according to
old-fashioned standards, she had been indiscreet, but apparently the
present day woman had a standard of her own.Alfred found his eye
wandering round the table surveying the wives of his friends.Was there
one of them, he wondered, who had never fibbed to her husband, or eaten
a simple luncheon unchaperoned by him?Of one thing he was certain,
there was not one of them so attractive as Zoie.Might she not be
forgiven, to some extent, if her physical charms had made her a source
of dangerous temptation to unprincipled scoundrels like the one with
whom she had no doubt lunched?Then, too, had she not offered at the
moment of his departure to tell him the "real truth"?Might this not
have been the one occasion upon which she would have done so?"She seemed
so sincere," he ruminated, "so truly penitent."Then again, how generous
it was of her to persist in writing to him with never an answer from
him to encourage her.If she cared for him so little as he had once
imagined, why should she wish to keep up even a presence of fondness?These were some of the thoughts that were going through Alfred's mind
just three months after his departure from Chicago, and all the while
his hostess was mentally dubbing him a "dull person."she said before he was down the front
steps."It's hard to believe, isn't it?"commented a third, and his host
apologised for the absent Alfred by saying that he was no doubt worried
about a particular business decision that had to be made the next
morning.But it was not the responsibility of this business decision that was
knotting Alfred's brow, as he walked hurriedly toward the hotel, where
he had told his office boy to leave the last mail.This had been
the longest interval that Zoie had ever let slip without writing.He
recalled that her last letters had hinted at a "slight indisposition."In fact, she had even mentioned "seeing the doctor"--"Good Heavens!"he
thought, "Suppose she were really ill?When Alfred reached his rooms, the boy had not yet arrived.He crossed
to the library table and took from the drawer all the letters thus far
received from Zoie."How could he have been
so stupid as not to have realised sooner that her illness--whatever it
was--had been gradually creeping upon her from the very first day of his
departure?"It contained no letter from Zoie and
Alfred went to bed with an uneasy mind.The next morning he was down at his office early, still no letter from
Zoie.Refusing his partner's invitation to lunch, Alfred sat alone in his
office, glad to be rid of intrusive eyes."He would write to Jimmy
Jinks," he decided, "and find out whether Zoie were in any immediate
danger."Not willing to await the return of his stenographer, or to acquaint her
with his personal affairs, Alfred drew pen and paper toward him and sat
helplessly before it.How could he inquire about Zoie without appearing
to invite a reconciliation with her?While he was trying to answer
this vexed question, a sharp knock came at the door.He turned to see a
uniformed messenger holding a telegram toward him.Intuitively he felt
that it contained some word about Zoie.His hand trembled so that he
could scarcely sign for the message before opening it.A moment later the messenger boy was startled out of his lethargy by a
succession of contradictory exclamations.cried Alfred incredulously as he gazed in ecstasy at the telegram.he shouted, excitedly, as he rose from his chair.he asked the astonished boy, and he began rummaging rapidly
through the drawers of his desk.And he thrust a bill into the small boy's
hand."Yes, sir," answered the boy and disappeared quickly, lest this madman
might reconsider his generosity.Alfred threw down the time table in despair."No train for Chicago until
night," he cried; but his mind was working fast.The next moment he was
at the telephone, asking for the Division Superintendent of the railway
line.When Alfred's partner returned from luncheon he found a curt note
informing him that Alfred had left on a special for Chicago and would
"write."CHAPTER XIV

During the evening of the same day that Alfred was enjoying such
pleasurable emotions, Zoie and Aggie were closeted in the pretty pink
and white bedroom that the latter had tried to describe to Jimmy.On
a rose-coloured couch in front of the fire sat Aggie threading ribbons
through various bits of soft white linen, and in front of her, at the
foot of a rose-draped bed, knelt Zoie.She was trying the effect of
a large pink bow against the lace flounce of an empty but inviting
bassinette.she called to Aggie, as she turned her head to one side
and surveyed the result of her experiment with a critical eye.Aggie shot a grudging glance at the bassinette."I wish you wouldn't
bother me every moment," she said."I'll never get all these things
finished."Apparently Zoie decided that the bow was properly placed, for she
applied herself to sewing it fast to the lining.In her excitement she
gave the thread a vicious pull."Oh, dear, oh dear, my thread is always
breaking!""Wouldn't YOU be excited," questioned Zoie'"if you were expecting a baby
and a husband in the morning?""I suppose I should," admitted Aggie.For a time the two friends sewed in silence, then Zoie looked up with
sudden anxiety."You're SURE Jimmy sent the wire?""I saw him write it," answered Aggie, "while I was in the office
to-day.""Oh, he won't GET it until to-morrow morning," said Aggie."I told you
that to-day."I wonder what he'll be doing when he gets it?"There was a
suspicion of a smile around her lips."What will he do AFTER he gets it?"Looking up at her friend in alarm, Zoie suddenly ceased sewing."You
don't mean he won't come?""Of course I don't," answered Aggie."He's only HUMAN if he is a
husband."There was a sceptical expression around Zoie's mouth, but she did not
pursue the subject."How do you suppose that red baby will ever look in
this pink basket?"And then with a regretful little sigh, she
declared that she wished she'd "used blue.""I didn't think the baby that we chose was so horribly red," said Aggie.cried Zoie, "it's magenta."she exclaimed in annoyance, and once more rethreaded her needle."I couldn't look at it," she continued with a disgusted little pucker of
her face."I wish they had let us take it this afternoon so I could have
got used to it before Alfred gets here.""Now don't be silly," scolded Aggie."You know very well that the
Superintendent can't let it leave the home until its mother signs the
papers.It will be here the first thing in the morning.You'll have all
day to get used to it before Alfred gets here.""ALL DAY," echoed Zoie, and the corners of her mouth began to droop."Won't Alfred be here before TO-MORROW NIGHT?"Aggie was becoming exasperated by Zoie's endless questions."I told
you," she explained wearily, "that the wire won't be delivered until
to-morrow morning, it will take Alfred eight hours to get here, and
there may not be a train just that minute.""Eight long hours," sighed Zoie dismally.And Aggie looked at her
reproachfully, forgetting that it is always the last hour that
is hardest to bear.Aggie was
meditating whether she should read her young friend a lecture on the
value of patience, when the telephone began to ring violently.Zoie looked up from her sewing with a frown."You answer it, will you,
Aggie?""Hello," called Aggie sweetly over the 'phone; then she added in
surprise, "Is this you, Jimmy dear?"Apparently it was; and as Zoie
watched Aggie's face, with its increasing distress she surmised that
Jimmy's message was anything but "dear."cried Aggie over the telephone, "that's awful!"was the first question that burst from Zoie's
lips.Aggie motioned to Zoie to be quiet.echoed Zoie joyfully; and without waiting for more details
and with no thought beyond the moment, she flew to her dressing table
and began arranging her hair, powdering her face, perfuming her lips,
and making herself particularly alluring for the prodigal husband's
return.Now the far-sighted Aggie was experiencing less pleasant sensations at
the phone.Then she asked irritably, "Well,
didn't you mark it 'NIGHT message'?"From the expression on Aggie's face
it was evident that he had not done so."But, Jimmy," protested Aggie,
"this is dreadful!Then calling to him to wait a
minute, and leaving the receiver dangling, she crossed the room to
Zoie, who was now thoroughly engrossed in the making of a fresh toilet.she exclaimed excitedly, "Jimmy made a mistake.""Of course he'd do THAT," answered Zoie carelessly."But you don't understand," persisted Aggie."They sent the 'NIGHT
message' TO-DAY.cried Zoie, and the next instant she was
waltzing gaily about the room."That's all very well," answered Aggie, as she followed Zoie with
anxious eyes, "but WHERE'S YOUR BABY?"cried Zoie, and for the first time she became conscious
of their predicament.She gazed at Aggie in consternation."I forgot all
about it," she said, and then asked with growing anxiety, "What can we
DO?"echoed Aggie, scarcely knowing herself what answer to make, "we've
got to GET it--TO-NIGHT."But," protested Zoie, "how CAN we get it when the mother hasn't signed
the papers yet?""Jimmy will have to arrange that with the Superintendent of the Home,"
answered Aggie with decision, and she turned toward the 'phone to
instruct Jimmy accordingly."Yes, that's right," assented Zoie, glad to be rid of all further
responsibility, "we'll let Jimmy fix it.""Say, Jimmy," called Aggie excitedly, "you'll have to go straight to the
Children's Home and get that baby just as quickly as you can.There's
some red tape about the mother signing papers, but don't mind about
that.Make them give it to you to-night.There was evidently a protest from the other end of the wire, for Aggie
added impatiently, "Go on, Jimmy, do!And with
that she hung up the receiver."Never mind about the clothes," answered Aggie."We're lucky if we get
the baby.""But I have to mind," persisted Zoie."I gave all its other things to
the laundress.And now the horrid
old creature hasn't brought them back yet.""You get into your OWN things," commanded Aggie.asked Zoie, her elation revived by the
thought of her fine raiment, and with that she flew to the foot of the
bed and snatched up two of the prettiest negligees ever imported from
Paris.she asked, as she held them both
aloft, "the pink or the blue?""It doesn't matter," answered Aggie wearily."Get into SOMETHING, that's
all.""Then unhook me," commanded Zoie gaily, as she turned her back to Aggie,
and continued to admire the two "creations" on her arm.So pleased was
she with the picture of herself in either of the garments that she began
humming a gay waltz and swaying to the rhythm."Stand still," commanded Aggie, but her warning was unnecessary, for at
that moment Zoie was transfixed by a horrible fear."Suppose," she said in alarm, "that Jimmy can't GET the baby?""He's GOT to get it," answered Aggie emphatically, and she undid the
last stubborn hook of Zoie's gown and put the girl from her."There,
now, you're all unfastened," she said, "hurry and get dressed.""You mean undressed," laughed Zoie, as she let her pretty evening gown
fall lightly from her shoulders and drew on her pink negligee.she exclaimed, as she caught sight of her reflection in the
mirror, "isn't it a love?"Alfred just adores
pink."answered Aggie, but in spite of herself, she was quite thrilled
by the picture of the exquisite young creature before her.Zoie had
certainly never looked more irresistible."Can't you get some of that
colour out of your cheeks," asked Aggie in despair."I'll put on some cold cream and powder," answered Zoie.She flew to her
dressing table; and in a moment there was a white cloud in her immediate
vicinity.She turned to Aggie to inquire the result."It couldn't be Alfred, could it?"asked Zoie with mingled hope and
dread."Of course not," answered Aggie, as she removed the receiver from the
hook."Alfred wouldn't 'phone, he would come right up."CHAPTER XV

Discovering that it was merely Jimmy "on the wire," Zoie's uneasiness
abated, but Aggie's anxiety was visibly increasing.she
repeated, then followed further explanations from Jimmy which were
apparently not satisfactory.cried his disturbed wife, "it
can't be!shrieked Zoie, trying to get her small ear close enough to
the receiver to catch a bit of the obviously terrifying message."Wait a minute," called Aggie into the 'phone.Then she turned to Zoie
with a look of despair."The mother's changed her mind," she explained;
"she won't give up the baby."cried Zoie, and she sank into the nearest chair.For an
instant the two women looked at each other with blank faces."What can
we DO," asked Zoie.This was indeed a serious predicament;
but presently Zoie saw her friend's mouth becoming very resolute, and
she surmised that Aggie had solved the problem."We'll have to get
ANOTHER baby, that's all," decided Aggie."There, in the Children's Home," answered Aggie with great confidence,
and she returned to the 'phone.Zoie crossed to the bed and knelt at its foot in search of her little
pink slippers."Oh, Aggie," she sighed, "the others were all so red!""Listen, Jimmy," she called in the
'phone, "can't you get another baby?"There was a pause, then Aggie
commanded hotly, "Well, GET in the business!"Another pause and then
Aggie continued very firmly, "Tell the Superintendent that we JUST MUST
have one."Zoie stopped in the act of putting on her second slipper and called a
reminder to Aggie."Tell him to get a HE one," she said, "Alfred wants a
boy."answered Aggie impatiently, and again she gave
her attention to the 'phone.she cried, with growing despair,
and Zoie waited to hear what had gone wrong now."Nothing under three
months," explained Aggie."A three-months' old baby is as big as a
whale.""Well, can't we say it GREW UP?"asked Zoie, priding herself on her
power of ready resource.Almost vanquished by her friend's new air of cold superiority, Zoie
was now on the verge of tears."Somebody must have a new baby," she
faltered."For their own personal USE, yes," admitted Aggie, "but who has a new
baby for US?""You're the one who ought to
know.You got me into this, and you've GOT to get me out of it.Can you
imagine," she asked, growing more and more unhappy, "what would happen
to me if Alfred were to come home now and not find a baby?He wouldn't
forgive a LITTLE lie, what would he do with a WHOPPER like this?"Then
with sudden decision, she rushed toward the 'phone."Let me talk to
Jimmy," she said, and the next moment she was chattering so rapidly and
incoherently over the 'phone that Aggie despaired of hearing one word
that she said, and retired to the next room to think out a new plan of
action."Say, Jimmy," stammered Zoie into the 'phone, "you've GOT to get me a
baby.If you don't, I'll kill myself!You got me
into this, Jimmy," she reminded him."You've GOT to get me out of it."And then followed pleadings and coaxings and cajolings, and at length,
a pause, during which Jimmy was apparently able to get in a word or so.she shrieked, tiptoeing
to get her lips closer to the receiver; then she added with conviction,
"the mother has no business to change her mind."Apparently Jimmy maintained that the mother had changed it none the
less."Well, take it away from her," commanded Zoie."Get it quick, while she
isn't looking."Then casting a furtive glance over her shoulder to make
sure that Aggie was still out of the room, she indulged in a few dark
threats to Jimmy, also some vehement reminders of how he had DRAGGED her
into that horrid old restaurant and been the immediate cause of all the
misfortunes that had ever befallen her.Could Jimmy have been sure that Aggie was out of ear-shot of Zoie's
conversation, the argument would doubtless have kept up indefinitely--as
it was--the result was a quick acquiescence on his part and by the time
that Aggie returned to the room, Zoie was wreathed in smiles."It's all right," she said sweetly."Goodness knows I hope so," she said,
then added in despair, "Look at your cheeks.Once more the powder puff was called into requisition, and Zoie turned a
temporarily blanched face to Aggie."Very much," answered Aggie, "but how about your hair?"Her reflection betrayed a
coiffure that might have turned Marie Antoinette green with envy."Would anybody think you'd been in bed for days?""Alfred likes it that way," was Zoie's defence."Turn around," said Aggie, without deigning to argue the matter further.And she began to remove handfuls of hairpins from the yellow knotted
curls.exclaimed Zoie, as she sprayed her white neck and
arms with her favourite perfume.Zoie leaned forward toward the mirror to smooth out her eyebrows with
the tips of her perfumed fingers."Good gracious," she cried in horror
as she caught sight of her reflection."You're not going to put my hair
in a pigtail!""That's the way invalids always have their hair," was Aggie's laconic
reply, and she continued to plait the obstinate curls.declared Zoie, and she shook herself free
from Aggie's unwelcome attentions and proceeded to unplait the hateful
pigtail."If you're going to make a perfect fright of me," pouted Zoie, "I just
won't see him.""He isn't coming to see YOU," reminded Aggie."He's coming to see the
baby.""If Jimmy doesn't come soon, I'll not HAVE any baby," answered Zoie."Get into bed," said Aggie, and she proceeded to turn down the soft lace
coverlets.Her eyes caught the small knot of
lace and ribbons for which she was looking, and she pinned it on top of
her saucy little curls."In you go," said Aggie, motioning to the bed."Wait," said Zoie impressively, "wait till I get my rose lights on the
pillow."She pulled the slender gold chain of her night lamp; instantly
the large white pillows were bathed in a warm pink glow--she studied
the effect very carefully, then added a lingerie pillow to the two
more formal ones, kicked off her slippers and hopped into bed.One more
glance at the pillows, then she arranged the ribbons of her negligee to
fall "carelessly" outside the coverlet, threw one arm gracefully above
her head, half-closed her eyes, and sank languidly back against her
pillows.Controlling her impulse to smile, Aggie crossed to the dressing-table
with a business-like air and applied to Zoie's pink cheeks a third
coating of powder.Zoie sat bolt upright and began to sneeze."Aggie," she said, "I just
hate you when you act like that."But suddenly she was seized with a new
idea."I wonder," she mused as she looked across the room at the soft, pink
sofa bathed in firelight, "I wonder if I shouldn't look better on that
couch under those roses."Aggie was very emphatic in her opinion to the contrary."Then," decided Zoie with a mischievous smile, "I'll get Alfred to carry
me to the couch.That way I can get my arms around his neck.And once
you get your arms around a man's neck, you can MANAGE him."Aggie looked down at the small person with distinct disapproval."Now,
don't you make too much fuss over Alfred," she continued."YOU'RE the
one who's to do the forgiving.What's more," she
reminded Zoie, "you're very, very weak."But before she had time to
instruct Zoie further there was a sharp, quick ring at the outer door.The two women glanced at each other inquiringly.The next instant a
man's step was heard in the hallway.demanded someone in a voice tense with anxiety."Lie down," commanded Aggie, and Zoie had barely time to fall back
limply on the pillows when the excited young husband burst into the
room.CHAPTER XVI

When Alfred entered Zoie's bedroom he glanced about him in bewilderment.It appeared that he was in an enchanted chamber.Through the dim rose
light he could barely perceive his young wife.She was lying white and
apparently lifeless on her pillows.He moved cautiously toward the bed,
but Aggie raised a warning finger.Afraid to speak, he grasped Aggie's
hand and searched her face for reassurance; she nodded toward Zoie,
whose eyes were closed.He tiptoed to the bedside, sank on his knees and
reverently kissed the small hand that hung limply across the side of the
bed.To Alfred's intense surprise, his lips had barely touched Zoie's
fingertips when he felt his head seized in a frantic embrace."Alfred,
Alfred!"cried Zoie in delight; then she smothered his face with kisses.As she lifted her head to survey her astonished husband, she caught
the reproving eye of Aggie.With a weak little sigh, she relaxed her
tenacious hold of Alfred, breathed his name very faintly, and sank back,
apparently exhausted, upon her pillows."It's been too much for her," said the terrified young husband, and he
glanced toward Aggie in anxiety."How pale she looks," added Alfred, as he surveyed the white face on the
pillows."She's so weak, poor dear," sympathised Aggie, almost in a whisper.Alfred nodded his understanding to Aggie.It was then that his attention
was for the first time attracted toward the crib.And again Zoie forgot Aggie's warning and
sat straight up in bed.He was making
determinedly for the crib, his heart beating high with the pride of
possession.Throwing back the coverlets of the bassinette, Alfred stared at the
empty bed in silence, then he quickly turned to the two anxious women.Zoie's lips opened to answer, but no words came.Alfred's eyes turned to Aggie.The look on her face increased his worst
fears."Don't tell me he's----" he could not bring himself to utter the
word.He continued to look helplessly from one woman to the other.Aggie also made an unsuccessful
attempt to speak.Then, driven to desperation by the strain of the
situation, Zoie declared boldly: "He's out.""With Jimmy," explained Aggie, coming to Zoie's rescue as well as she
knew how."Just for a breath of air," explained Zoie sweetly She had now entirely
regained her self-possession."Isn't he very young to be out at night?"asked Alfred with a puzzled
frown."We told Jimmy that," answered Aggie, amazed at the promptness
with which each succeeding lie presented itself."But you see," she
continued, "Jimmy is so crazy about the child that we can't do anything
with him.""He always
said babies were 'little red worms.'""Not this one," answered Zoie sweetly."No, indeed," chimed in Aggie."I'll soon put a stop to that,"
he declared.Again the two women looked at each other inquiringly, then Aggie
stammered evasively."Oh, j-just downstairs--somewhere.""I'll LOOK j-just downstairs somewhere," decided Alfred, and he snatched
up his hat and started toward the door.Coming back to her bedside to reassure her, Alfred was caught in a
frantic embrace."I'll be back in a minute, dear," he said, but Zoie
clung to him and pleaded desperately."You aren't going to leave me the very first thing?"He had no wish to be cruel to Zoie, but the thought of
Jimmy out in the street with his baby at this hour of the night was not
to be borne."Now, dearie," she said, "I
wish you'd go get shaved and wash up a bit.I don't wish baby to see you
looking so horrid.""Yes, do, Alfred," insisted Aggie."He's sure to be here in a minute.""My boy won't care HOW his father looks," declared Alfred proudly, and
Zoie told Aggie afterward that his chest had momentarily expanded three
inches."But _I_ care," persisted Zoie."Now, Zoie," cautioned Aggie, as she crossed toward the bed with
affected solicitude.Zoie was quick to understand the suggested change in her tactics, and
again she sank back on her pillows apparently ill and faint.Utterly vanquished by the dire result of his apparently inhuman
thoughtlessness, Alfred glanced at Aggie, uncertain as to how to repair
the injury.Aggie beckoned to him to come away from the bed."Let her have her own way," she whispered with a significant glance
toward Zoie.Alfred nodded understandingly and put a finger to his lips to signify
that he would henceforth speak in hushed tones, then he tiptoed back to
the bed and gently stroked the curls from Zoie's troubled forehead."There now, dear," he whispered, "lie still and rest and I'll go shave
and wash up a bit.""Mind," he whispered to Aggie, "you are to call me the moment my boy
comes," and then he slipped quietly into the bedroom.No sooner had Alfred crossed the threshold, than Zoie sat up in bed and
called in a sharp whisper to Aggie, "What's keeping them?""I can't imagine," answered Aggie, also in whisper."If I had Jimmy here," declared Zoie vindictively, "I'd wring his little
fat neck," and slipping her little pink toes from beneath the covers,
she was about to get out of bed, when Aggie, who was facing Alfred's
bedroom door, gave her a warning signal.Zoie had barely time to get back beneath the covers, when Alfred
re-entered the room in search of his satchel.Aggie found it for him
quickly.Alfred glanced solicitously at Zoie's closed eyes."I'm so sorry," he
apologised to Aggie, and again he slipped softly out of the room.Aggie and Zoie drew together for consultation."Suppose Jimmy can't get the baby," whispered Zoie."In that case, he'd have 'phoned," argued Aggie."Let's 'phone to the Home," suggested Zoie, "and find----" She was
interrupted by Alfred's voice."Say, Aggie," called Alfred from the next room.answered Aggie sweetly, and she crossed to the door and waited."Not yet, Alfred," said Aggie, and she closed the door very softly, lest
Alfred should hear her."I never knew Alfred could be so silly!"warned Aggie, and she glanced anxiously toward Alfred's door."He doesn't care a bit about me!""It's all that horrid
old baby that he's never seen.""If Jimmy doesn't come soon, he never WILL see it," declared Aggie, and
she started toward the window to look out.Just then there was a short quick ring of the bell.The two women
glanced at each other with mingled hope and fear.Then their eyes sought
the door expectantly.CHAPTER XVII

With the collar of his long ulster pushed high and the brim of his derby
hat pulled low, Jimmy Jinks crept cautiously into the room.When he at
length ceased to glance over his shoulder and came to a full stop, Aggie
perceived a bit of white flannel hanging beneath the hem of his tightly
buttoned coat."Give it to me," demanded Aggie.Jimmy stared at them as though stupefied, then glanced uneasily over his
shoulder, to make sure that no one was pursuing him.Aggie unbuttoned
his ulster, seized a wee mite wrapped in a large shawl, and clasped it
to her bosom with a sigh of relief.she exclaimed, then
crossed quickly to the bassinette and deposited her charge.In the meantime, having thrown discretion to the wind, Zoie had hopped
out of bed.As usual, her greeting to Jimmy was in the nature of a
reproach."Yes," chimed in Aggie, who was now bending over the crib.answered Jimmy hotly, "if you two think you can do any
better, you're welcome to the job," and with that he threw off his
overcoat and sank sullenly on the couch.exclaimed Zoie and Aggie, simultaneously, and they glanced
nervously toward Alfred's bedroom door.Jimmy looked at them without comprehending why he should "sh."Instead, Zoie turned her back upon him."Let's see it," she said, peeping into the bassinette.And then with a
little cry of disgust she again looked at Jimmy reproachfully.Jimmy's contempt for woman's ingratitude was too
deep for words, and he only stared at her in injured silence.But his
reflections were quickly upset when Alfred called from the next room, to
inquire again about Baby.whispered Jimmy, beginning to realise the meaning of
the women's mysterious behaviour.said Aggie again to Jimmy, and Zoie flew toward the bed,
almost vaulting over the footboard in her hurry to get beneath the
covers.For the present Alfred did not disturb them further.Apparently he was
still occupied with his shaving, but just as Jimmy was about to ask for
particulars, the 'phone rang.The three culprits glanced guiltily at
each other.whispered Zoie in a frightened voice.Jimmy paused in the act of sitting and turned his round eyes toward the
'phone."But we can't," she was
saying; "that's impossible."called Zoie across the foot of the bed, unable longer to
endure the suspense."How dare you call my husband a
thief!""Wait a minute," said Aggie, then she left the receiver hanging by the
cord and turned to the expectant pair behind her."It's the Children's
Home," she explained."That awful woman says Jimmy STOLE her baby!"exclaimed Zoie as though such depravity on Jimmy's part were
unthinkable.Then she looked at him accusingly, and asked in low,
measured tones, "DID you STEAL HER BABY, JIMMY?""How else COULD I steal a baby?"Zoie looked at the unfortunate creature as if she could strangle him,
and Aggie addressed him with a threat in her voice."Well, the Superintendent says you've got to bring it straight back.""He sha'n't bring it back," declared Zoie.asked Aggie, "he's holding the
wire.""Tell him he can't have it," answered Zoie, as though that were the end
of the whole matter."Well," concluded Aggie, "he says if Jimmy DOESN'T bring it back the
mother's coming after it."As for Jimmy, he bolted for the door.Aggie caught him by the sleeve as
he passed."Wait, Jimmy," she said peremptorily.There was a moment of
awful indecision, then something approaching an idea came to Zoie."Tell the Superintendent that it isn't here," she whispered to Aggie
across the footboard."Tell him that Jimmy hasn't got here yet.""Yes," agreed Jimmy, "tell him I haven't got here yet."Aggie nodded wisely and returned to the 'phone."Hello," she called
pleasantly; then proceeded to explain.There was a pause, then she added in her most conciliatory tone, "I'll
tell him what you say when he comes in."Another pause, and she hung up
the receiver with a most gracious good-bye and turned to the others with
increasing misgivings."He says he won't be responsible for that mother
much longer--she's half-crazy.""Well," decided Aggie after careful deliberation, "you'd better take it
back, Jimmy, before Alfred sees it."And again Jimmy bolted, but again he
failed to reach the door.CHAPTER XVIII

His face covered with lather, and a shaving brush in one hand, Alfred
entered the room just as his friend was about to escape.exclaimed the excited young father, "you're back.""Oh, yes--yes," admitted Jimmy nervously, "I'm back."cried Alfred, and he glanced toward the crib."Yes--yes," agreed Aggie uneasily, as she tried to place herself between
Alfred and the bassinette."He's here, but you mayn't have him, Alfred."exclaimed Alfred, trying to put her out of the way."Not yet," protested Aggie, "not just yet.""Give him to me," demanded Alfred, and thrusting Aggie aside, he took
possession of the small mite in the cradle."But--but, Alfred," pleaded Aggie, "your face.He was bending over the cradle in an ecstasy.Lifting the baby in his arms he circled
the room cooing to him delightedly."Was he away from home when his fadder came?Suddenly he remembered to whom he owed this wondrous
treasure and forgetful of the lather on his unshaven face he rushed
toward Zoie with an overflowing heart.he exclaimed, and
he covered her cheek with kisses.cried Zoie in disgust and she pushed Alfred from her and
brushed the hateful lather from her little pink check.But Alfred was not to be robbed of his exaltation, and again he circled
the room, making strange gurgling sounds to Baby."Did a horrid old Jimmy take him away from fadder?"he said
sympathetically, in the small person's ear; and he glanced at Jimmy with
frowning disapproval."I'd just like to see him get you away from me
again!"he added to Baby, as he tickled the mite's ear with the end of
his shaving brush.he exclaimed in trepidation, as he
perceived a bit of lather on the infant's cheek.Then lifting the boy
high in his arms and throwing out his chest with great pride, he looked
at Jimmy with an air of superiority."I guess I'm bad, aye?"As for Zoie, she was growing more and more
impatient for a little attention to herself."Rock-a-bye, Baby," sang Alfred in strident tones and he swung the child
high in his arms.Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Alfred as though hypnotised.They kept time to
his lullaby out of sheer nervousness.Suddenly Alfred stopped, held the
child from him and gazed at it in horror."Look at that baby's face," commanded
Alfred.Zoie and Aggie exchanged alarmed glances, then Zoie asked in
trepidation, "What's the matter with his face?""He's got a fever," declared Alfred.And he started toward the bed to
show the child to its mother.shrieked Zoie, waving Alfred off in wild alarm.asked Alfred, backing from her in surprise.Aggie crossed quickly to Alfred's side and looked over his shoulder at
the boy."I don't see anything wrong with its face," she said."Oh," said Jimmy with a superior air, "they're always like that.""Nothing of the sort," snorted Alfred, and he glared at Jimmy
threateningly."You've frozen the child parading him around the
streets.""Let me have him, Alfred," begged Aggie sweetly; "I'll put him in his
crib and keep him warm."His eyes followed him to the crib
with anxiety.he asked, as he glanced first from
one to the other.Zoie and Jimmy stared about the room as though expecting the desired
person to drop from the ceiling.Then Zoie turned upon her unwary
accomplice."Jimmy," she called in a threatening tone, "where IS his nurse?""Does Jimmy take the nurse out, too?"demanded Alfred, more and more
annoyed by the privileges Jimmy had apparently been usurping in his
absence."Never mind about the nurse," interposed Aggie.I'll tuck him in," and she bent fondly over the crib, but Alfred
was not to be so easily pacified."Do you mean to tell me," he exclaimed excitedly, "that my boy hasn't
any nurse?""We HAD a nurse," corrected Zoie, "but--but I had to discharge her."Alfred glanced from one to the other for an explanation."She was crazy," stammered Zoie.Alfred's eyes sought Aggie's for confirmation.The latter jerked his head up and down in
nervous assent."Well," said Alfred, amazed at their apparent lack of resource, "why
didn't you get ANOTHER nurse?""Aggie is going to stay and take care of baby to-night," declared Zoie,
and then she beamed upon Aggie as only she knew how."Yes, indeed," answered Aggie, studiously avoiding Jimmy's eye."Baby is going to sleep in the spare room with Aggie and Jimmy," said
Zoie.exclaimed Jimmy, too desperate to care what Alfred might infer.Ignoring Jimmy's implied protest, Zoie continued sweetly to Alfred:

"Now, don't worry, dear; go back to your room and finish your shaving."Then his hand went
mechanically to his cheek and he stared at Zoie in astonishment.he exclaimed, "I had forgotten all about it.That shows you how
excited I am."And with a reluctant glance toward the cradle, he went
quickly from the room, singing a high-pitched lullaby.Just as the three conspirators were drawing together for consultation,
Alfred returned to the room.It was apparent that there was something
important on his mind."By the way," he said, glancing from one to another, "I forgot to
ask--what's his name?"The conspirators looked at each other without answering.Of course his son had been given his father's name,
but he wished to HEAR someone say so."Baby's, I mean," he explained impatiently.Jimmy felt instinctively that Zoie's eyes were upon him.called Zoie, meaning only to appeal to him for a name.After waiting in vain for any response, Alfred advanced upon the
uncomfortable Jimmy."You seem to be very popular around here," he sneered.Jimmy shifted uneasily from one foot to the other and studied the
pattern of the rug upon which he was standing.After what seemed an age to Jimmy, Alfred turned his back upon his old
friend and started toward his bedroom.Jimmy peeped out uneasily from
his long eyelashes.When Alfred reached the threshold, he faced about
quickly and stared again at Jimmy for an explanation.It seemed to Jimmy
that Alfred's nostrils were dilating.He would not have been surprised
to see Alfred snort fire.He let his eyes fall before the awful
spectacle of his friend's wrath.Alfred's upper lip began to curl.He
cast a last withering look in Jimmy's direction, retired quickly from
the scene and banged the door.When Jimmy again had the courage to lift his eyes he was confronted by
the contemptuous gaze of Zoie, who was sitting up in bed and regarding
him with undisguised disapproval."Why didn't you tell him what the baby's name is?""How do _I_ know what the baby's name is?"cautioned Aggie as she glanced nervously toward the door
through which Alfred had just passed."What does it matter WHAT the baby's name is so long as we have to send
it back?""I'll NOT send it back," declared Zoie emphatically, "at least not until
morning.That will give Jimmy a whole night to get another one.""See here, you two can't be changing babies
every five minutes without Alfred knowing it."You know perfectly well that all
young babies look just alike.Their own mothers couldn't tell them
apart, if it weren't for their clothes."Before Aggie could answer, Alfred was again heard calling from the next
room.Apparently all his anger had subsided, for he inquired in the most
amiable tone as to what baby might be doing and how he might be feeling.Aggie crossed quickly to the door, and sweetly reassured the anxious
father, then she closed the door softly and turned to Zoie and Jimmy
with a new inspiration lighting her face."I have it," she exclaimed
ecstatically."Now see here," he objected, "every time YOU 'HAVE IT,' I DO IT.The
NEXT time you 'HAVE IT' YOU DO IT!"The emphasis with which Jimmy made his declaration deserved
consideration, but to his amazement it was entirely ignored by both
women.Hopping quickly out of bed, without even glancing in his
direction, Zoie gave her entire attention to Aggie."There must be OTHER babies' Homes," said Aggie, and she glanced at
Jimmy from her superior height."They aren't open all night like corner drug stores," growled Jimmy."Well, they ought to be," decided Zoie."And surely," argued Aggie, "in an extraordinary case--like----"

"This was an 'extraordinary case,'" declared Jimmy, "and you saw what
happened this time, and the Superintendent is a friend of mine--at least
he WAS a friend of mine."And with that Jimmy sat himself down on the
far corner of the couch and proceeded to ruminate on the havoc that
these two women had wrought in his once tranquil life.Zoie gazed at Jimmy in deep disgust; her friend Aggie had made an
excellent suggestion, and instead of acting upon it with alacrity, here
sat Jimmy sulking like a stubborn child."I suppose," said Zoie, as her eyebrows assumed a bored angle, "there
are SOME babies in the world outside of Children's Homes.""Of course," was Aggie's enthusiastic rejoinder; "there's one born every
minute.""But I was born BETWEEN minutes," protested Jimmy.Again Aggie exclaimed that she "had it.""She's got it twice as bad," groaned Jimmy, and he wondered what new
form her persecution of him was about to take."We can't advertise NOW," protested Zoie.answered Aggie, as she snatched the paper quickly from
the table and began running her eyes up and down its third page."Married--married," she murmured, and then with delight she found
the half column for which she was searching."Born," she exclaimed
triumphantly.Get a pencil, Zoie, and we'll take down all
the new ones.""Of course," agreed Zoie, clapping her hands in glee, "and Jimmy can get
a taxi and look them right up."shouted Jimmy as he rose with clenched fists."Now you
two, see here----"

Before Jimmy could complete his threat, there was a sharp ring of the
door bell.He looked at the two women inquiringly."It's the mother," cried Zoie in a hoarse whisper.repeated Jimmy in terror and he glanced uncertainly from
one door to the other.called Zoie, and drawing Jimmy's overcoat quickly
from his arm, Aggie threw it hurriedly over the cradle.For an instant Jimmy remained motionless in the centre of the room,
hatless, coatless, and shorn of ideas.A loud knock on the door decided
him and he sank with trembling knees behind the nearest armchair, just
as Zoie made a flying leap into the bed and prepared to draw the cover
over her head.The knock was repeated and Aggie signalled to Zoie to answer it.CHAPTER XIX

From his hiding-place Jimmy peeped around the edge of the armchair and
saw what seemed to be a large clothes basket entering the room.Closer
inspection revealed the small figure of Maggie, the washerwoman's
daughter, propelling the basket, which was piled high with freshly
laundered clothing.Jimmy drew a long sigh of relief, and unknotted his
cramped limbs."Shall I lay the things on the sofa, mum?"asked Maggie as she placed
her basket on the floor and waited for Zoie's instructions."Yes, please," answered Zoie, too exhausted for further comment.Taking the laundry piece by piece from the basket, Maggie made excuses
for its delay, while she placed it on the couch.Deaf to Maggie's
chatter, Zoie lay back languidly on her pillows; but she soon heard
something that lifted her straight up in bed."Me mother is sorry she had to kape you waitin' this week," said Maggie
over her shoulder; "but we've got twins at OUR house."Then together they stared
at Maggie as though she had been dropped from another world.Finding attention temporarily diverted from himself, Jimmy had begun to
rearrange both his mind and his cravat when he felt rather than saw that
his two persecutors were regarding him with a steady, determined gaze.In spite of himself, Jimmy raised his eyes to theirs.Now, Jimmy had heard Maggie's announcement about the bountiful supply
of offspring lately arrived at her house, but not until he caught the
fanatical gleam in the eyes of his companions did he understand the
part they meant him to play in their next adventure.He waited for no
explanation--he bolted toward the door.But it was not until she had laid firm
hold of him that he waited.Surprised by such strange behaviour on the part of those whom she
considered her superiors, Maggie looked first at Aggie, then at Jimmy,
then at Zoie, uncertain whether to go or to stay."Anythin' to go back, mum?"Zoie stared at Maggie solemnly from across the foot of the bed."Maggie," she asked in a deep, sepulchral tone, "where do you live?""Just around the corner on High Street, mum," gasped Maggie.Then,
keeping her eyes fixed uneasily on Zoie she picked up her basket and
backed cautiously toward the door.commanded Zoie; and Maggie paused, one foot in mid-air."Wait in
the hall," said Zoie."Yes'um," assented Maggie, almost in a whisper.Then she nodded her
head jerkily, cast another furtive glance at the three persons who were
regarding her so strangely, and slipped quickly through the door.Having crossed the room and stealthily closed the door, Aggie returned
to Jimmy, who was watching her with the furtive expression of a trapped
animal."It's Providence," she declared, with a grave countenance.Jimmy looked up at Aggie with affected innocence, then rolled his round
eyes away from her.He was confronted by Zoie, who had approached from
the opposite side of the room."It's Fate," declared Zoie, in awe-struck tones.Jimmy was beginning to wriggle, but he kept up a last desperate presence
of not understanding them."You needn't tell me I'm going to take the wash to the old lady," he
said, "for I'm not going to do it.""It isn't the WASH," said Aggie, and her tone warned him that she
expected no nonsense from him."You know what we are thinking about just as well as we do," said Zoie."I'll write that washerwoman a note and tell her we must have one of
those babies right now."And with that she turned toward her desk and
began rummaging amongst her papers for a pencil and pad."The luck of
these poor," she murmured."The luck of US," corrected Aggie, whose spirits were now soaring.Then
she turned to Jimmy with growing enthusiasm."Just think of it, dear,"
she said, "Fate has sent us a baby to our very door.""Well," declared Jimmy, again beginning to show signs of fight, "if
Fate has sent a baby to the door, you don't need me," and with that he
snatched his coat from the crib."Wait, Jimmy," again commanded Aggie, and she took his coat gently but
firmly from him."Now, see here," argued Jimmy, trying to get free from his strong-minded
spouse, "you know perfectly well that that washerwoman isn't going to
let us have that baby.""Nonsense," called Zoie over her shoulder, while she scribbled a hurried
note to the washerwoman."If she won't let us have it 'for keeps,' I'll
just'rent it.'""Warm, fresh,
palpitating babies rented as you would rent a gas stove!""That's all a pose," declared Aggie, in a matter-of-fact tone."You
think babies 'little red worms,' you've said so.""She'll be only too glad to rent it," declared Zoie, as she glanced
hurriedly through the note just written, and slipped it, together with
a bill, into an envelope.It's only until I can
get another one."shouted Jimmy, and his eyes turned heavenward for help."An
endless chain with me to put the links together!""Don't be so theatrical," said Aggie, irritably, as she took up Jimmy's
coat and prepared to get him into it."Why DO you make such a fuss about NOTHING," sighed Zoie.echoed Jimmy, and he looked at her with wondering eyes."I crawl about like a thief in the night snatching babies from their
mother's breasts, and you call THAT nothing?""You don't have to 'CRAWL,'" reminded Zoie, "you can take a taxi.""Here's your coat, dear," said Aggie graciously, as she endeavoured to
slip Jimmy's limp arms into the sleeves of the garment."You can take Maggie with you," said Zoie, with the air of conferring a
distinct favour upon him."And the wash on my lap," added Jimmy sarcastically."No," said Zoie, unruffled by Jimmy's ungracious behaviour."That's very kind of you," sneered Jimmy, as he unconsciously allowed
his arms to slip into the sleeves of the coat Aggie was urging upon him."All you need to do," said Aggie complacently, "is to get us the baby.""Yes," said Jimmy, "and what do you suppose my friends would say if they
were to see me riding around town with the wash-lady's daughter and a
baby on my lap?he asked Aggie, "if you didn't know
the facts?""Nobody's going to see you," answered Aggie impatiently; "it's only
around the corner.Go on, Jimmy, be a good boy.""You mean a good thing," retorted Jimmy without budging from the spot.exclaimed Zoie; "it's as easy as can be.""Yes, the FIRST one SOUNDED easy, too," said Jimmy."All you have to do," explained Zoie, trying to restrain her rising
intolerance of his stupidity, "is to give this note to Maggie's mother.She'll give you her baby, you bring it back here, we'll give you THIS
one, and you can take it right back to the Home.""And meet the other mother," concluded Jimmy with a shake of his head.There was a distinct threat in Zoie's voice when she again addressed the
stubborn Jimmy and the glitter of triumph was in her eyes."You'd better meet here THERE than HERE," she warned him; "you know what
the Superintendent said.""That's true," agreed Aggie with an anxious face."Come now," she
pleaded, "it will only take a minute; you can do the whole thing before
you have had time to think.""Before I have had time to think," repeated Jimmy excitedly."That's how
you get me to do everything.Well, this time I've HAD time to think and
I don't think I will!"and with that he threw himself upon the couch,
unmindful of the damage to the freshly laundered clothes."You haven't time to sit down," said Aggie."I'll TAKE time," declared Jimmy.His eyes blinked ominously and he
remained glued to the couch.There was a short silence; the two women gazed at Jimmy in despair.Remembering a fresh grievance, Jimmy turned upon them."By the way," he said, "do you two know that I haven't had anything to
eat yet?""And do you know," said Zoie, "that Alfred may be back at any minute?"Not unless he has cut his throat," rejoined Jimmy, "and that's what I'd
do if I had a razor."Zoie regarded Jimmy as though he were beyond redemption."Can't you ever
think of anybody but yourself?"she asked, with a martyred air.Had Jimmy been half his age, Aggie would have felt sure that she saw him
make a face at her friend for answer.As it was, she resolved to make
one last effort to awaken her unobliging spouse to a belated sense of
duty."You see, dear," she said, "you might better get the washerwoman's baby
than to go from house to house for one," and she glanced again toward
the paper."Yes," urged Zoie, "and that's just what you'll HAVE to do, if you don't
get this one."It was apparent that his courage was
slipping from him.Aggie was quick to realise her opportunity, and
before Jimmy could protect himself from her treacherous wiles, she had
slipped one arm coyly about his neck."Now, Jimmy," she pleaded as she pressed her soft cheek to his throbbing
temple, and toyed with the bay curl on his perspiring forehead, "wont
you do this little teeny-weepy thing just for me?"Jimmy's lips puckered in a pout; he began to blink nervously.Aggie
slipped her other arm about his neck."You know," she continued with a baby whine, "I got Zoie into this, and
I've just got to get her out of it.You're not going to desert me,
are you, Jimmy?You WILL help me, won't you, dear?"Her breath was on
Jimmy's cheek; he could feel her lips stealing closer to his.He had not
been treated to much affection of late.His head drooped lower--he began
to twiddle the fob on his watch chain.she repeated, and her soft eyelashes just brushed the tip
of his retrousee nose.Jimmy's head was now wagging from side to side.she entreated a fourth time, and she kissed him full on the
lips.With a resigned sigh, Jimmy rose mechanically from the heap of crushed
laundry and held out his fat chubby hand."Give me the letter," he groaned."Here you are," said Zoie, taking Jimmy's acquiescence as a matter of
course; and she thrust the letter into the pocket of Jimmy's ulster."Now, when you get back with the baby," she continued, "don't come in
all of a sudden; just wait outside and whistle.You CAN WHISTLE, can't
you?"For answer, Jimmy placed two fingers between his lips and produced a
shrill whistle that made both Zoie and Aggie glance nervously toward
Alfred's bedroom door."Yes, you can WHISTLE," admitted Zoie, then she continued her
directions."If Alfred is not in the room, I'll raise the shade and you
can come right up."asked Jimmy with a fine shade of sarcasm."If he IS in the room," explained Zoie, "you must wait outside until I
can get rid of him."Jimmy turned his eyes toward Aggie to ask if it were possible that she
still approved of Zoie's inhuman plan.For answer Aggie stroked his coat
collar fondly."We'll give you the signal the moment the coast is clear," she said,
then she hurriedly buttoned Jimmy's large ulster and wound a muffler
about his neck."There now, dear, do go, you're all buttoned up," and
with that she urged him toward the door."Just a minute," protested Jimmy, as he paused on the threshold."Let me
get this right, if the shade is up, I stay down.""Not at all," corrected Aggie and Zoie in a breath."If the shade is up,
you come up."Jimmy cast another martyred look in Zoie's direction.he said, "you know it is only twenty-three
below zero and I haven't had anything to eat yet--and----"

"Yes, we know," interrupted the two women in chorus, and then Aggie
added wearily, "go on, Jimmy; don't be funny.""With a baby on my lap and the wash lady's
daughter, I won't be funny, oh no!"It is doubtful whether Jimmy would not have worked himself into another
state of open rebellion had not Aggie put an end to his protests by
thrusting him firmly out of the room and closing the door behind him.After this act of heroic decision on her part, the two women listened
intently, fearing that he might return; but presently they heard the
bang of the outer door, and at last they drew a long breath of relief.For the first time since Alfred's arrival, Aggie was preparing to sink
into a chair, when she was startled by a sharp exclamation from Zoie."Good heavens," cried Zoie, "I forgot to ask Maggie.""Boys or girls," said Zoie, with a solemn look toward the door through
which Jimmy had just disappeared."Well," decided Aggie, after a moment's reflection, "it's too late now.Anyway," she concluded philosophically, "we couldn't CHANGE it."CHAPTER XX

With more or less damage to himself consequent on his excitement, Alfred
completed his shaving and hastened to return to his wife and the babe.Finding the supposedly ill Zoie careering about the centre of the room
expostulating with Aggie, the young man stopped dumbfounded on the
threshold."Zoie," he cried in astonishment.For an instant the startled Zoie gazed at him stupefied."Why, I--I----" Her eyes sought Aggie's for a suggestion; there was no
answer there.It was not until her gaze fell upon the cradle that she
was seized by the desired inspiration."I just got up to see baby," she faltered, then putting one hand giddily
to her head, she pretended to sway.In an instant Alfred's arms were about her."You stay here, my darling," he said tenderly."I'll bring baby
to you," and after a solicitous caress he turned toward baby's crib and
bent fondly over the little one."Ah, there's father's man," he said.Oh, goodis g'acious," then followed an incoherent
muttering of baby talk, as he bore the youngster toward Zoie's bed."Come, my precious," he called to Zoie, as he sank down on the edge of
the bed.It had suddenly dawned upon her that
this was the name by which Alfred would no doubt call her for the rest
of her life.But Alfred did not see the look of disgust on Zoie's face."What a funny face," he cooed as he pinched the youngster's cheek."Great Scott, what a grip," he cried as the infant's fingers closed
around his own."Will you look at the size of those hands," he
exclaimed.Zoie and Aggie exchanged worried glances; the baby had no doubt
inherited his large hands from his mother."Say, Aggie," called Alfred, "what are all of these little specks
on baby's forehead?""One, two,
three," he counted.Zoie was becoming more and more uncomfortable at the close proximity of
the little stranger."Oh," said Aggie, with affected carelessness as she leaned over Alfred's
shoulder and glanced at baby's forehead.exclaimed Alfred excitedly, "that's dangerous, isn't it?And he rose and started hurriedly toward the
telephone, baby in arms."Don't be silly," called Zoie, filled with vague alarm at the thought of
the family physician's appearance and the explanations that this might
entail.Stepping between Alfred and the 'phone, Aggie protested frantically."You see, Alfred," she said, "it is better to have the rash OUT, it
won't do any harm unless it turns IN.""He's perfectly well," declared Zoie, "if you'll only put him in his
crib and leave him alone."he asked, and he
tickled the little fellow playfully in the ribs."I'll tell you what,"
he called over his shoulder to Zoie, "he's a fine looking boy."And then
with a mysterious air, he nodded to Aggie to approach.Aggie glanced at her, uncertain what
answer to make."I--I hadn't thought," she stammered weakly."Go on, go on," exclaimed the proud young father, "you can't tell me
that you can look at that boy and not see the resemblance.""Why," said Alfred, "he's the image of Zoie."Zoie gazed at the puckered red face in Alfred's arms.she
shrieked in disgust, then fall back on her pillows and drew the lace
coverlet over her face.Mistaking Zoie's feeling for one of embarrassment at being over-praised,
Alfred bore the infant to her bedside."See, dear," he persisted, "see
for yourself, look at his forehead.""I'd rather look at you," pouted Zoie, peeping from beneath the
coverlet, "if you would only put that thing down for a minute."exclaimed Alfred, as though doubting his own ears.But before
he could remonstrate further, Zoie's arms were about his neck and she
was pleading jealously for his attention."Please, Alfred," she begged, "I have scarcely had a look at you, yet."Alfred shook his head and turned to baby with an indulgent smile.It was
pleasant to have two such delightful creatures bidding for his entire
attention."Dear me, tink of mudder wanting to look at
a big u'gy t'ing like fadder, when she could look at a 'itty witty t'ing
like dis," and he rose and crossed to the crib where he deposited the
small creature with yet more gurgling and endearing.Zoie's dreams of rapture at Alfred's home coming had not included such
divided attention as he was now showing her and she was growing more and
more desperate at the turn affairs had taken.She resolved to put a stop
to his nonsense and to make him realise that she and no one else was the
lode star of his existence.She beckoned to Aggie to get out of the
room and to leave her a clear field and as soon as her friend had gone
quietly into the next room, she called impatiently to Alfred who was
still cooing rapturously over the young stranger.Finding Alfred deaf
to her first entreaty, Zoie shut her lips hard, rearranged her pretty
head-dress, drew one fascinating little curl down over her shoulder,
reknotted the pink ribbon of her negligee, and then issued a final and
imperious order for her husband to attend her."Yes, yes, dear," answered Alfred, with a shade of impatience."I'm
coming, I'm coming."And bidding a reluctant farewell to the small
person in the crib, he crossed to her side.Zoie caught Alfred's hand and drew him down to her; he smiled
complacently."Well," he said in the patronising tone that Zoie always resented."How
is hubby's little girl?""It's about time," pouted Zoie, "that you made a little fuss over me for
a change."He stooped to kiss the eager lips, but just
as his young wife prepared to lend herself to his long delayed embrace,
his mind was distracted by an uneasy thought."Do you think that Baby
is----"

He was not permitted to finish the sentence.Zoie drew him back to her with a sharp exclamation."Think of ME for a while," she commanded."My darling," expostulated Alfred with a shade of surprise at her
vehemence.Again he stooped to
embrace her and again his mind was directed otherwise."I wonder if Baby
is warm enough," he said and attempted to rise."Wonder about ME for a while," snapped Zoie, clinging to him
determinedly.Was it possible there was
anything besides Baby worth wondering about?Whether there was or not,
Zoie was no longer to be resisted and with a last regretful look at the
crib, he resigned himself to giving his entire attention to his spoiled
young wife.Gratified by her hard-won conquest, Zoie now settled herself in Alfred's
arms."You haven't told me what you did all the time that you were away," she
reminded him."Oh, there was plenty to do," answered Alfred."That would be telling," laughed Alfred, as he pinched her small pink
ear."I wish to be 'told,'" declared Zoie; "I don't suppose you realise it,
but if I were to live a THOUSAND YEARS, I'd never be quite sure what you
did during those FEW MONTHS.""It was nothing that you wouldn't have been proud of," answered Alfred,
with an unconscious expansion of his chest."Do you love me as much as ever?""Behave yourself," answered Alfred, trying not to appear flattered
by the discovery that his absence had undoubtedly caused her great
uneasiness."You know I do," answered Alfred, with the diffidence of a school boy."Then kiss me," concluded Zoie, with an air of finality that left Alfred
no alternative.As a matter of fact, Alfred was no longer seeking an alternative.He was
again under the spell of his wife's adorable charms and he kissed her
not once, but many times."Foolish child," he murmured, then he laid her tenderly against the
large white pillows, remonstrating with her for being so spoiled, and
cautioning her to be a good little girl while he went again to see about
Baby.Zoie clung to his hand and feigned approaching tears."You aren't thinking of me at all?""And kisses are no
good unless you put your whole mind on them.Again Alfred stooped to humour the small importunate person who was so
jealous of his every thought, but just as his lips touched her forehead
his ear was arrested by a sound as yet new both to him and to Zoie."I don't know," answered Zoie, wondering if the cat could have got into
the room.A redoubled effort on the part of the young stranger directed their
attention in the right direction.exclaimed Alfred tragically, "it's Baby.And
with that, he rushed to the crib and clasped the small mite close to his
breast, leaving Zoie to pummel the pillows in an agony of vexation.After vain cajoling of the angry youngster, Alfred bore him excitedly to
Zoie's bedside."You'd better take him, dear," he said.To the young husband's astonishment, Zoie waved him from her in terror,
and called loudly for Aggie.But no sooner had Aggie appeared on the
scene, than a sharp whistle was heard from the pavement below.Attributing Zoie's uneasiness to a caprice of modesty, Alfred turned
from the cradle to reassure her."No one can see in way up here," he said.To Zoie's distress, the lowering of the shade was answered by a yet
shriller whistle from the street below."Was it 'up' or 'down'?"cried Zoie to Aggie in an agony of doubt, as
she tried to recall her instructions to Jimmy."I don't know," answered Aggie.Alarmed by
Zoie's increasing excitement, and thinking she was troubled merely by
a sick woman's fancy that someone might see through the window, Alfred
placed the babe quickly in its cradle and crossed to the young wife's
bed."It was up, dear," he said."Then I want it up," declared the seemingly perverse Zoie.A succession of emotional whistles set Zoie to pounding the pillows."Did I say 'up' or did I say 'down'?"moaned the half-demented Zoie,
while long whistles and short whistles, appealing whistles and impatient
whistles followed each other in quick succession."You said down, dear," persisted Alfred, now almost as distracted as his
wife."I wish you'd get out of here," she cried;
"you make me so nervous that I can't think at all.""Of course, dear," murmured Alfred, "if you wish it."And with a hurt
and perplexed expression on his face he backed quickly from the room.CHAPTER XXI

When Zoie's letter asking for the O'Flarety twin had reached that young
lady's astonished mother, Mrs.O'Flarety felt herself suddenly lifted to
a position of importance.Hardy a wantin' my little Bridget," she
exclaimed, and she began to dwell upon the romantic possibilities of
her offspring's future under the care of such a "foine stylish lady and
concluded by declaring it 'a lucky day entoirely.'"Jimmy had his misgivings about it being Bridget's "LUCKY day," but it
was not for him to delay matters by dwelling upon the eccentricities
of Zoie's character, and when Mrs.O'Flarety had deposited Bridget in
Jimmy's short arms and slipped a well filled nursing bottle into his
overcoat pocket, he took his leave hastily, lest the excited woman add
Bridget's twin to her willing offering.Once out of sight of the elated mother, Jimmy thrust the defenceless
Bridget within the folds of his already snug ulster, buttoned the
garment in such places as it would meet, and made for the taxi which,
owing to the upset condition of the street, he had been obliged to
abandon at the corner.Whether the driver had obtained a more promising "fare" or been run
in by the police, Jimmy never knew.At any rate it was in vain that he
looked for his vehicle.So intense was the cold that it was impossible
to wait for a chance taxi; furthermore, the meanness of the district
made it extremely unlikely that one would appear, and glancing guiltily
behind him to make sure that no one was taking cognisance of his strange
exploit, Jimmy began picking his way along dark lanes and avoiding the
lighted thoroughfare on which the "Sherwood" was situated, until he was
within a block of his destination.Panting with haste and excitement, he eventually gained courage to
dash through a side street that brought him within a few doors of the
"Sherwood."Again glancing behind him, he turned the well lighted corner
and arrived beneath Zoie's window to find one shade up and one down.In
his perplexity he emitted a faint whistle.Immediately he saw the other
shade lowered.Uncertain as to what arrangement he had actually made
with Zoie, he ventured a second whistle.The result was a hysterical
running up and down of the shade which left him utterly bewildered as to
what disposition he was supposed to make of the wobbly bit of humanity
pressed against his shirt front.Reaching over his artificially curved figure to grasp a bit of white
that trailed below his coat, he looked up to see a passing policeman
eyeing him suspiciously."Ye-yes," mumbled Jimmy with affected nonchalence and he knocked the
heels of his boots together in order to keep his teeth from chattering."It's a fi-fine ni-night for air," he stuttered.said the policeman, and to Jimmy's horror, he saw the fellow's
eyes fix themselves on the bit of white."Go-good-night," stammered Jimmy hurriedly, and trying to assume an
easy stride in spite of the uncomfortable addition to his already rotund
figure, he slipped into the hotel, where avoiding the lighted elevator,
he laboured quickly, up the stairs.At the very moment when Zoie was driving Alfred in consternation from
the room, Jimmy entered it uninvited."Get out," was the inhospitable greeting received simultaneously from
Zoie and Aggie, and without waiting for further instructions he "got."Fortunately for all concerned, Alfred, who was at the same moment
departing by way of the bedroom door, did not look behind him; but it
was some minutes before Aggie who had followed Jimmy into the hall could
persuade him to return.After repeated and insistent signals both from Aggie and Zoie, Jimmy's
round red face appeared cautiously around the frame of the door.It bore
unmistakable indications of apoplexy.But the eyes of the women were not
upon Jimmy's face, they too had caught sight of the bit of white that
hung below his coat, and dragging him quickly into the room and closing
the door, Aggie proceeded without inquiry or thanks to unbutton his coat
and to take from beneath it the small object for which she and Zoie had
been eagerly waiting.sighed Zoie, as she saw Aggie bearing the latest
acquisition to Alfred's rapidly increasing family safely toward the
crib.Suddenly remembering something in his right hand coat pocket, Jimmy
called to Aggie, who turned to him and waited expectantly.After
characteristic fumbling, he produced a well filled nursing bottle."For HER," grunted Jimmy, and he nodded toward the bundle in Aggie's
arms.cried Zoie and Aggie in chorus.Zoie shut her lips hard and gazed
at him with contempt."I might have known you'd get the wrong kind," she said.What Jimmy thought about the ingratitude of woman was not to be
expressed in language.He controlled himself as well as he could and
merely LOOKED the things that he would like to have said."Well, it can't be helped now," decided the philosophic Aggie; "here,
Jimmy," she said, "you hold 'HER' a minute and I'll get you the other
one."Placing the small creature in Jimmy's protesting arms, Aggie turned
toward the cradle to make the proposed exchange when she was startled by
the unexpected return of Alfred.Thanks to the ample folds of Jimmy's ulster, he was able to effectually
conceal his charge and he started quickly toward the hall, but in making
the necessary detour around the couch he failed to reach the door before
Alfred, who had chosen a more direct way."Hold on, Jimmy," exclaimed Alfred good-naturedly, and he laid a
detaining hand on his friend's shoulder."I'll be back," stammered Jimmy weakly, edging his way toward the door,
and contriving to keep his back toward Alfred."Wait a minute," said Alfred jovially, as he let his hand slip onto
Jimmy's arm, "you haven't told me the news yet.""I'll tell you later," mumbled Jimmy, still trying to escape.But
Alfred's eye had fallen upon a bit of white flannel dangling below
the bottom of Jimmy's ulster, it travelled upward to Jimmy's unusually
rotund figure.he demanded to know, as he pointed toward the
centre button of Jimmy's overcoat.echoed Jimmy vapidly, glancing at the button in question, "why,
that's just a little----" There was a faint wail from the depths of
the ulster.Jimmy began to caper about with elephantine tread."Oochie,
coochie, oochie," he called excitedly.cried the anxious father, "it's my boy."And with that
he pounced upon Jimmy, threw wide his ulster and snatched from his arms
Jimmy's latest contribution to Zoie's scheme of things.As Aggie had previously remarked, all young babies look very much alike,
and to the inexperienced eye of this new and overwrought father, there
was no difference between the infant that he now pressed to his breast,
and the one that, unsuspected by him, lay peacefully dozing in the crib,
not ten feet from him.He gazed at the face of the newcomer with the
same ecstasy that he had felt in the possession of her predecessor.But
Zoie and Aggie were looking at each other with something quite different
from ecstasy."My boy," exclaimed Alfred, with deep emotion, as he clasped the tiny
creature to his breast."What were you doing
with my baby?""I--I was just taking him out for a little walk!""You just try," threatened Alfred, and he towered over the intimidated
Jimmy.Jimmy was of the opinion that he must be crazy or he would never have
found himself in such a predicament as this, but the anxious faces of
Zoie and Aggie, denied him the luxury of declaring himself so.He sank
mutely on the end of the couch and proceeded to sulk in silence.As for Aggie and Zoie, they continued to gaze open-mouthed at Alfred,
who was waltzing about the room transported into a new heaven of delight
at having snatched his heir from the danger of another night ramble with
Jimmy."Did a horrid old Jimmy spoil his 'itty nap'?"Then
with a sudden exclamation of alarm, he turned toward the anxious women.he cried, as he stared intently into Baby's face.Aggie pretended to glance over Alfred's shoulder."Why so it has," she agreed nervously."It's all right now," counselled Aggie, "so long as it didn't turn in
too suddenly.""We'd better keep him warm, hadn't we?"suggested Alfred, remembering
Aggie's previous instructions on a similar occasion."I'll put him in
his crib," he decided, and thereupon he made a quick move toward the
bassinette.Staggering back from the cradle with the unsteadiness of a drunken man
Alfred called upon the Diety.he demanded as he pointed
toward the unexpected object before him.Neither Zoie, Aggie, nor Jimmy could command words to assist Alfred's
rapidly waning powers of comprehension, and it was not until he had
swept each face for the third time with a look of inquiry that Zoie
found breath to stammer nervously, "Why--why--why, that's the OTHER
one."echoed Alfred in a dazed manner; then he turned to
Aggie for further explanation."Yes," affirmed Aggie, with an emphatic nod, "the other one."An undescribable joy was dawning on Alfred's face."You don't mean----" He stared from the infant in his arms to the one in
the cradle, then back again at Aggie and Zoie.Alfred turned toward
Zoie for the final confirmation of his hopes."Yes, dear," assented Zoie sweetly, "that's Alfred."What Jimmy and the women saw next appeared to be the dance of a whirling
dervish; as a matter of fact, it was merely a man, mad with delight,
clasping two infants in long clothes and circling the room with them.When Alfred could again enunciate distinctly, he rushed to Zoie's side
with the babes in his arms."My darling," he exclaimed, "why didn't you tell me?""I was ashamed," whispered Zoie, hiding her head to shut out the sight
of the red faces pressed close to hers.cried Alfred, struggling to control his complicated
emotions; then gazing at the precious pair in his arms, he cast his eyes
devoutly toward heaven, "Was ever a man so blessed?"Zoie peeped from the covers with affected shyness."I love you TWICE as much," declared Alfred, and with that he sank
exhausted on the foot of the bed, vainly trying to teeter one son on
each knee.CHAPTER XXII

When Jimmy gained courage to turn his eyes in the direction of the
family group he had helped to assemble, he was not reassured by the
reproachful glances that he met from Aggie and Zoie.It was apparent
that in their minds, he was again to blame for something.Realising that
they dared not openly reproach him before Alfred, he decided to make his
escape while his friend was still in the room.He reached for his hat
and tiptoed gingerly toward the door, but just as he was congratulating
himself upon his decision, Alfred called to him with a mysterious air."Jimmy," he said, "just a minute," and he nodded for Jimmy to approach.It must have been Jimmy's guilty conscience that made him powerless
to disobey Alfred's every command.Anyway, he slunk back to the fond
parent's side, where he ultimately allowed himself to be inveigled into
swinging his new watch before the unattentive eyes of the red-faced
babes on Alfred's knees."Lower, Jimmy, lower," called Alfred as Jimmy absent-mindedly allowed
the watch to swing out of the prescribed orbit."Look at the darlings,
Jimmy, look at them," he exclaimed as he gazed at the small creatures
admiringly."Yes, look at them, Jimmy," repeated Zoie, and she glared at Jimmy
behind Alfred's back."Don't you wish you had one of them, Jimmy?'""Well, _I_ wish he had," commented Zoie, and she wondered how she was
ever again to detach either of them from Alfred's breast.Before she could form any plan, the telephone rang loud and
persistently.Jimmy glanced anxiously toward the women for instructions."I'll answer it," said Aggie with suspicious alacrity, and she crossed
quickly toward the 'phone.The scattered bits of conversation that Zoie
was able to gather from Aggie's end of the wire did not tend to soothe
her over-excited nerves.As for Alfred, he was fortunately so engrossed
with the babies that he took little notice of what Aggie was saying."Certainly not," exclaimed Aggie,
"don't let her come up; send her away.Hardy can't see anyone at
all."Then followed a bit of pantomime between Zoie and Aggie, from
which it appeared that their troubles were multiplying, then Aggie again
gave her attention to the 'phone."I don't know anything about her," she
fibbed, "that woman must have the wrong address."And with that she hung
up the receiver and came towards Alfred, anxious to get possession of
his two small charges and to get them from the room, lest the mother who
was apparently downstairs should thrust herself into their midst.asked Alfred, and he nodded toward the
telephone."Oh, just some woman with the wrong address," answered Aggie with
affected carelessness."You'd better let me take the babies now,
Alfred.""To bed," answered Aggie sweetly, "they are going to sleep in the next
room with Jimmy and me."She laid a detaining hand on Jimmy's arm."It's very late," argued Aggie."Of course it is," insisted Zoie."Please, Alfred," she pleaded, "do let
Aggie take them.""Mother knows best," he sighed, but ignoring
Aggie's outstretched arms, he refused to relinquish the joy of himself
carrying the small mites to their room, and he disappeared with the two
of them, singing his now favourite lullaby.When Alfred had left the room, Jimmy, who was now seated comfortably in
the rocker, was rudely startled by a sharp voice at either side of him.shrieked Zoie, with all the disapproval that could be got into
the one small word."You're very clever, aren't you?"sneered Aggie at Jimmy's other elbow."A nice fix you've got me into NOW," reproved Zoie."Why didn't you get out when you had the chance?""You would take your own sweet time, wouldn't you," said Zoie.exclaimed Zoie, and she walked up and down the room
excitedly, oblivious of the disarrangement of her flying negligee."Oh yes," assented Jimmy, as he sank back into the rocker and
began propelling himself to and fro."I never felt better," but a
disinterested observer would have seen in him the picture of discomfort."You're going to feel a great deal WORSE," he was warned by Aggie."Do
you know who that was on the telephone?""She's down stairs," explained Aggie.Jimmy had stopped rocking--his face now wore an uneasy expression."It's time you showed a little human intelligence," taunted Zoie, then
she turned her back upon him and continued to Aggie, "what did she say?""She says," answered Aggie, with a threatening glance toward Jimmy,
"that she won't leave this place until Jimmy gives her baby back.""Let her have her old baby," said Jimmy.snapped Zoie indignantly, "what have YOU got to do
with it?""Oh nothing, nothing," acquiesced Jimmy meekly, "I'm a mere detail.""A lot you care what becomes of me," exclaimed Zoie reproachfully; then
she turned to Aggie with a decided nod."Well, I want it," she asserted."But Zoie," protested Aggie in astonishment, "you can't mean to keep
BOTH of them?""Jimmy has presented Alfred with twins," continued Zoie testily, "and
now, he has to HAVE twins."Jimmy's eyes were growing rounder and rounder."Do you know," continued Zoie, with a growing sense of indignation,
"what would happen to me if I told Alfred NOW that he WASN'T the father
of twins?He'd fly straight out of that door and I'd never see him
again."Aggie admitted that Zoie was no doubt speaking the truth."Jimmy has awakened Alfred's paternal instinct for twins," declared
Zoie, with another emphatic nod of her head, "and now Jimmy must take
the consequences."Jimmy tried to frame a few faint objections, but Zoie waved him aside,
with a positive air.If it were only ONE, it
wouldn't be so bad, but to tell Alfred that he's lost twins, he couldn't
live through it.""But Zoie," argued Aggie, "we can't have that mother hanging around down
stairs until that baby is an old man.She'll have us arrested, the next
thing."asked Zoie, with wide baby eyes.And she nodded toward the now utterly vanquished
Jimmy."That's right," murmured Jimmy, with a weak attempt at sarcasm, "don't
leave me out of anything good.""It doesn't matter WHICH one she arrests," decided the practical Aggie."Well, it matters to me," objected Zoie."And to me too, if it's all the same to you," protested Jimmy."Whoever it is," continued Aggie, "the truth is bound to come out.Alfred will have to know sooner or later, so we might as well make a
clean breast of it, first as last.""That's the first sensible thing you've said in three months," declared
Jimmy with reviving hope.sneered Zoie, and she levelled her most malicious look
at Jimmy."What do you think Alfred would do to YOU, Mr.Jimmy, if he
knew the truth?YOU'RE the one who sent him the telegram; you are the
one who told him that he was a FATHER.""That's true," admitted Aggie, with a wrinkled forehead.Zoie was quick to see her advantage."And Alfred
hasn't any sense of humour, you know."And with that he
sank into his habitual state of dumps."Your sarcasm will do a great deal of good," flashed Zoie.Then she
dismissed him with a nod, and crossed to her dressing table."But Zoie," persisted Aggie, as she followed her young friend in
trepidation, "don't you realise that if you persist in keeping this
baby, that mother will dog Jimmy's footsteps for the rest of his life?""That will be nice," murmured Jimmy.Zoie busied herself with her toilet, and turned a deaf ear to Aggie.There was a touch of genuine emotion in Aggie's voice when she
continued."Just think of it, Zoie, Jimmy will never be able to come and go like a
free man again.""What do I care how he comes and goes?""If
Jimmy had gone when we told him to go, that woman would have had her old
baby by now; but he didn't, oh no!All he ever does is to sit around and
talk about his dinner.""Yes," cried Jimmy hotly, "and that's about as far as I ever GET with
it.""You'll never get anywhere with anything," was Zoie's exasperating
answer."Well, there's nothing slow about you," retorted Jimmy, stung to a
frenzy by her insolence."Oh please, please," interposed Aggie, desperately determined to keep
these two irascible persons to the main issue."What are we going to
tell that mother?""You can tell her whatever you like," answered Zoie, with an impudent
toss of her head, "but I'll NOT give up that baby until I get ANOTHER
one.'It was apparent that he must needs
increase the number of his brain cells if he were to follow this
extraordinary young woman's line of thought much further."You don't
expect to go on multiplying them forever, do you?""YOU are the one who has been multiplying them," was Zoie's
disconcerting reply.It was evident to Jimmy that he could not think fast enough nor clearly
enough to save himself from a mental disaster if he continued to argue
with the shameless young woman, so he contented himself by rocking to
and fro and murmuring dismally that he had "known from the first that it
was to be an endless chain."While Zoie and Jimmy had been wrangling, Aggie had been weighing the
pros and cons of the case.She now turned to Jimmy with a tone of firm
but motherly decision."Zoie is quite right," she said.Jimmy rolled his large eyes up at his spouse with a "you too, Brutus,"
expression.Aggie continued mercilessly, "It's the only way, Jimmy."No sooner had Aggie arrived at her decision than Zoie upset her
tranquillity by a triumphant expression of "I have it."Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Zoie's radiant face in consternation.They were
accustomed to see only reproach there.Her sudden enthusiasm increased
Jimmy's uneasiness."YOU have it," he grunted without attempting to conceal his disgust."SHE'S the one who generally has it."Inflamed by her young friend's enthusiasm, Aggie rushed to her eagerly.exclaimed Zoie, as though the revelation had come
straight from heaven."SHE HAD TWINS," and with that, two pairs of eyes
turned expectantly toward the only man in the room.Tracing the pattern of the rug with his toe, Jimmy remained stubbornly
oblivious of their attentions.He rearranged the pillows on the couch,
and finally, for want of a better occupation, he wound his watch.He could feel Zoie's cat-like gaze upon him."Jimmy can get the other one," she said."The hell I can," exclaimed Jimmy, starting to his feet and no longer
considering time or place.The two women gazed at him reproachfully.cried Aggie, in a shocked, hurt voice."That's the first time
I've ever heard you swear.""Well, it won't be the LAST time," declared Jimmy hotly, "if THIS keeps
up."He paced to and fro like an infuriated lion."Dearest," said Aggie, "you look almost imposing.""Nonsense," interrupted Zoie, who found Jimmy unusually ridiculous."If
I'd known that Jimmy was going to put such an idea into Alfred's head,
I'd have got the two in the first place.""Of course she will," answered Zoie, leaving Jimmy entirely out of
the conversation."She's as poor as a church mouse.What could she do with one twin, anyway?"A snort of rage from Jimmy did not disturb Zoie's enthusiasm.She
proceeded to elaborate her plan."I'll adopt them," she declared, "I'll leave them all Alfred's money.Think of Alfred having real live twins for keeps.""It would be nice, wouldn't it?"Zoie turned to Jimmy, as though they were on the best of terms.Before Jimmy could declare himself penniless, Aggie answered for him
with the greatest enthusiasm, "He has a whole lot; he drew some today."exclaimed Zoie to the abashed Jimmy, and then she continued in a
matter-of-fact tone, "Now, Jimmy," she said, "you go give the washwoman
what money you have on account, then tell her to come around here in the
morning when Alfred has gone out and I'll settle all the details with
her.Go on now, Jimmy," she continued, "you don't need another letter.""No," chimed in Aggie sweetly; "you know her now, dear.""Oh, yes," corroborated Jimmy, with a sarcastic smile and without
budging from the spot on which he stood, "we are great pals now."asked Zoie, astonished that Jimmy was not starting
on his mission with alacrity."You know what happened the last time you hesitated," warned Aggie."I know what happened when I DIDN'T hesitate," ruminated Jimmy, still
holding his ground.Zoie's eyes were wide with surprise."You don't mean to say," she
exclaimed incredulously, "that you aren't GOING--after we have thought
all this out just to SAVE you?""Say," answered Jimmy, with a confidential air, "do me a favour, will
you?"But, Jimmy----" protested both women simultaneously; but before they
could get further Alfred's distressed voice reached them from the next
room.CHAPTER XVIII

What seemed to be a streak of pink through the room was in reality Zoie
bolting for the bed.While Zoie hastened to snuggle comfortably under the covers, Aggie tried
without avail to get Jimmy started on his errand.Getting no response from Aggie, Alfred, bearing one infant in his arms,
came in search of her.Apparently he was having difficulty with the
unfastening of baby's collar."Aggie," he called sharply, "how on earth do you get this fool pin out?""Take him back, Alfred," answered Aggie impatiently; "I'll be there in a
minute."But Alfred had apparently made up his mind that he was not a success as
a nurse."You'd better take him now, Aggie," he decided, as he offered the small
person to the reluctant Aggie."I'll stay here and talk to Jimmy.""Oh, but Jimmy was just going out," answered Aggie; then she turned to
her obdurate spouse with mock sweetness, "Weren't you, dear?""Yes," affirmed Zoie, with a threatening glance toward Jimmy."Just for a little air," explained Aggie blandly."Yes," growled Jimmy, "another little heir.""He had air a while ago with my
son.He is going to stay here and tell me the news.Sit down, Jimmy,"
he commanded, and to the intense annoyance of Aggie and Zoie, Jimmy sank
resignedly on the couch.Alfred was about to seat himself beside his friend, when the 'phone rang
violently.Being nearest to the instrument, Alfred reached it first and
Zoie and Aggie awaited the consequences in dread.What they heard did
not reassure them nor Jimmy.Jimmy began to wriggle with a vague uneasiness."Well," continued Alfred at the 'phone, "that woman has the wrong
number."Then with a peremptory "Wait a minute," he turned to Zoie, "The
hall boy says that woman who called a while ago is still down stairs and
she won't go away until she has seen you, Zoie.She has some kind of an
idiotic idea that you know where her baby is.""Well," decided Alfred, "I'd better go down stairs and see what's
the matter with her," and he turned toward the door to carry out his
intention.She was half out of bed in her anxiety.'Phone down to the boy to send her away."Oh," said Alfred, "then she's been here before?answered Zoie, trying to gain time for a new inspiration."Why, she's--she's----" her face lit up with satisfaction--the idea had
arrived."She's the nurse," she concluded emphatically."Yes," answered Zoie, pretending to be annoyed with his dull memory."She's the one I told you about, the one I had to discharge.""Oh," said Alfred, with the relief of sudden comprehension; "the crazy
one?"Aggie and Zoie nodded their heads and smiled at him tolerantly, then
Zoie continued to elaborate."You see," she said, "the poor creature was
so insane about little Jimmy that I couldn't go near the child.""I'll soon tell the boy what
to do with her," he declared, and he rushed to the 'phone.Barely had
Alfred taken the receiver from the hook when the outer door was heard
to bang.Before he could speak a distracted young woman, whose excitable
manner bespoke her foreign origin, swept through the door without seeing
him and hurled herself at the unsuspecting Zoie.The woman's black hair
was dishevelled, and her large shawl had fallen from her shoulders.To
Jimmy, who was crouching behind an armchair, she seemed a giantess.cried the frenzied mother, with what was unmistakably an
Italian accent.There was no answer; her eyes sought
the cradle.she shrieked, then upon finding the cradle empty, she
redoubled her lamentations and again she bore down upon the terrified
Zoie."You," she cried, "you know where my baby is!"For answer, Zoie sank back amongst her pillows and drew the bed covers
completely over her head.Alfred approached the bed to protect his young
wife; the Italian woman wheeled about and perceived a small child in his
arms."I knew it," she cried; "I knew it!"Managing to disengage himself from what he considered a mad woman, and
elevating one elbow between her and the child, Alfred prevented the
mother from snatching the small creature from his arms."Calm yourself, madam," he commanded with a superior air."We are very
sorry for you, of course, but we can't have you coming here and going on
like this.He's OUR baby and----"

"He's NOT your baby!"cried the infuriated mother; "he's MY baby.Give him to me," and with that she sprang upon the
uncomfortable Alfred like a tigress.Throwing her whole weight on his
uplifted elbow, she managed to pull down his arm until she could look
into the face of the washerwoman's promising young offspring.The air
was rent by a scream that made each individual hair of Jimmy's head
stand up in its own defence.He could feel a sickly sensation at the top
of his short thick neck."He's NOT my baby," wailed the now demented mother, little dreaming that
the infant for which she was searching was now reposing comfortably on a
soft pillow in the adjoining room.As for Alfred, all of this was merely confirmation of Zoie's statement
that this poor soul was crazy, and he was tempted to dismiss her with
worthy forbearance."I am glad, madam," he said, "that you are coming to your senses."Now, all would have gone well and the bewildered mother would no doubt
have left the room convinced of her mistake, had not Jimmy's nerves got
the better of his judgment.Having slipped cautiously from his position
behind the armchair he was tiptoeing toward the door, and was flattering
himself on his escape, when suddenly, as his forward foot cautiously
touched the threshold, he heard the cry of the captor in his wake, and
before he could possibly command the action of his other foot, he felt
himself being forcibly drawn backward by what appeared to be his too
tenacious coat-tails."If only they would tear," thought Jimmy, but thanks to the excellence
of the tailor that Aggie had selected for him, they did NOT "tear."Not until she had anchored Jimmy safely to the centre of the rug did the
irate mother pour out the full venom of her resentment toward him.From
the mixture of English and Italian that followed, it was apparent that
she was accusing Jimmy of having stolen her baby."Take me to him," she demanded tragically; "my baby--take me to him!""Humour her," whispered Alfred, much elated by the evidence of his
own self-control as compared to Jimmy's utter demoralisation under the
apparently same circumstances.Alfred was becoming vexed; he pointed first to his own forehead, then
to that of Jimmy's hysterical captor.He even illustrated his meaning
by making a rotary motion with his forefinger, intended to remind Jimmy
that the woman was a lunatic.Still Jimmy only stared at him and all the while the woman was becoming
more and more emphatic in her declaration that Jimmy knew where her baby
was."Sure, Jimmy," said Alfred, out of all patience with Jimmy's stupidity
and tiring of the strain of the woman's presence.cried the mother, and she towered over Jimmy with a wild light in
her eyes."Take me to him," she demanded; "take me to him."Jimmy rolled his large eyes first toward Aggie, then toward Zoie and at
last toward Alfred."Take her to him, Jimmy," commanded a concert of voices; and pursued by
a bundle of waving colours and a medley of discordant sounds, Jimmy shot
from the room.CHAPTER XXIV

The departure of Jimmy and the crazed mother was the occasion for a
general relaxing among the remaining occupants of the room.Exhausted
by what had passed Zoie had ceased to interest herself in the future.It
was enough for the present that she could sink back upon her pillows and
draw a long breath without an evil face bending over her, and without
the air being rent by screams.As for Aggie, she fell back upon the window seat and closed her eyes.The horrors into which Jimmy might be rushing had not yet presented
themselves to her imagination.Of the three, Alfred was the only one who had apparently received
exhilaration from the encounter.He was strutting about the room with
the babe in his arms, undoubtedly enjoying the sensations of a hero.When he could sufficiently control his feeling of elation, he looked
down at the small person with an air of condescension and again lent
himself to the garbled sort of language with which defenceless infants
are inevitably persecuted."Tink of dat horrid old woman wanting to steal our own little oppsie,
woppsie, toppsie babykins," he said.Then he turned to Zoie with an
air of great decision."That woman ought to be locked up," he declared,
"she's dangerous," and with that he crossed to Aggie and hurriedly
placed the infant in her unsuspecting arms."Here, Aggie," he said, "you
take Alfred and get him into bed."Glad of an excuse to escape to the next room and recover her self
control, Aggie quickly disappeared with the child.For some moments Alfred continued to pace up and down the room; then he
came to a full stop before Zoie."I'll have to have something done to that woman," he declared
emphatically."Jimmy will do enough to her," sighed Zoie, weakly."She's no business to be at large," continued Alfred; then, with a
business-like air, he started toward the telephone.He was now calling into the 'phone, "Give me
information."demanded Zoie, more and more disturbed by
his mysterious manner."One can't be too careful," retorted Alfred in his most paternal
fashion; "there's an awful lot of kidnapping going on these days.""Well, you don't suspect information, do you?"Again Alfred ignored her; he was intent upon things of more importance."Hello," he called into the 'phone, "is this information?"Apparently it
was for he continued, with a satisfied air, "Well, give me the Fullerton
Street Police Station."cried Zoie, sitting up in bed and looking about the room
with a new sense of alarm.shrieked the over-wrought young wife."Now, now, dear, don't get nervous,"
he said, "I am only taking the necessary precautions."And again he
turned to the 'phone.Alarmed by Zoie's summons, Aggie entered the room hastily.She was not
reassured upon hearing Alfred's further conversation at the 'phone."Is this the Fullerton Street Police Station?"echoed Aggie, and her eyes sought Zoie's inquiringly.called Alfred over his shoulder to the excited Aggie, then
he continued into the 'phone.Well, hello, Donneghey, this is your
old friend Hardy, Alfred Hardy at the Sherwood.I've just got back,"
then he broke the happy news to the no doubt appreciative Donneghey.he said, "I'm a happy father."Zoie puckered her small face in disgust.Alfred continued to elucidate joyfully at the 'phone."Doubles," he said, "yes--sure--on the level.""I don't know why you have to tell the whole neighbourhood," snapped
Zoie.But Alfred was now in the full glow of his genial account to his friend.he repeated in answer to an evident suggestion from the
other end of the line, "I should say I would.Tell
the boys I'll be right over.And say, Donneghey," he added, in a more
confidential tone, "I want to bring one of the men home with me.I
want him to keep an eye on the house to-night"; then after a pause, he
concluded confidentially, "I'll tell you all about it when I get there.It looks like a kidnapping scheme to me," and with that he hung up the
receiver, unmistakably pleased with himself, and turned his beaming face
toward Zoie."It's all right, dear," he said, rubbing his hands together with evident
satisfaction, "Donneghey is going to let us have a Special Officer to
watch the house to-night.""I won't HAVE a special officer," declared Zoie vehemently; then
becoming aware of Alfred's great surprise, she explained half-tearfully,
"I'm not going to have the police hanging around our very door.I would
feel as though I were in prison.""You ARE in prison, my dear," returned the now irrepressible Alfred."A
prison of love--you and our precious boys."He stooped and implanted a
gracious kiss on her forehead, then turned toward the table for his hat."Now," he said, "I'll just run around the corner, set up the drinks for
the boys, and bring the officer home with me," and drawing himself up
proudly, he cried gaily in parting, "I'll bet there's not another man in
Chicago who has what I have to-night.""I hope not," groaned Zoie.Then,
thrusting her two small feet from beneath the coverlet and perching on
the side of the bed, she declared to Aggie that "Alfred was getting more
idiotic every minute.""He's worse than idiotic," corrected Aggie.If
he gets the police around here before we give that baby back, they'll
get the mother.She'll tell all she knows and that will be the end of
Jimmy!"exclaimed Zoie, "it'll be the end of ALL of us.""I can see our pictures in the papers, right now," groaned Aggie."Jimmy IS a villain," declared Zoie.How am I ever going to get that other twin?""There is only one thing to do," decided Aggie, "I must go for it
myself."And she snatched up her cape from the couch and started toward
the door.cried Zoie, in alarm, "and leave me alone?""It's our only chance," argued Aggie."I'll have to do it now, before
Alfred gets back.""But Aggie," protested Zoie, clinging to her departing friend, "suppose
that crazy mother should come back?""Nonsense," replied Aggie, and before Zoie could actually realise what
was happening the bang of the outside door told her that she was alone.CHAPTER XXV

Wondering what new terrors awaited her, Zoie glanced uncertainly from
door to door.So strong had become her habit of taking refuge in the
bed, that unconsciously she backed toward it now.Barely had she reached
the centre of the room when a terrific crash of breaking glass from the
adjoining room sent her shrieking in terror over the footboard, and head
first under the covers.Here she would doubtless have remained until
suffocated, had not Jimmy in his backward flight from one of the
inner rooms overturned a large rocker.This additional shock to Zoie's
overstrung nerves forced a wild scream from her lips, and an answering
exclamation from the nerve-racked Jimmy made her sit bolt upright.She
gazed at him in astonishment.His tie was awry, one end of his collar
had taken leave of its anchorage beneath his stout chin, and was now
just tickling the edge of his red, perspiring brow.His hair was on end
and his feelings were undeniably ruffled.As usual Zoie's greeting did
not tend to conciliate him."The fire-escape," panted Jimmy and he nodded mysteriously toward the
inner rooms of the apartment.There was only one and that led through the
bathroom window.He was now peeping cautiously out of the
window toward the pavement below.Jimmy jerked his thumb in the direction of the street.Zoie gazed at him
with grave apprehension.Jimmy shook his head and continued to peer cautiously out of the window."What did _I_ do with her?"repeated Jimmy, a flash of his old
resentment returning.For the first time, Zoie became fully conscious of Jimmy's ludicrous
appearance.Her overstrained nerves gave way and she began to laugh
hysterically."Say," shouted Jimmy, towering over the bed and devoutly wishing that
she were his wife so that he might strike her with impunity."Don't you
sic any more lunatics onto me."It is doubtful whether Zoie's continued laughter might not have provoked
Jimmy to desperate measures, had not the 'phone at that moment directed
their thoughts toward worse possibilities.After the instrument had
continued to ring persistently for what seemed to Zoie an age, she
motioned to Jimmy to answer it.He responded by retreating to the other
side of the room."It may be Aggie," suggested Zoie.For the first time, Jimmy became aware that Aggie was nowhere in the
apartment.he exclaimed, as he realised that he was again tete-a-tete
with the terror of his dreams."Gone to do what YOU should have done," was Zoie's characteristic
answer."Well," answered Jimmy hotly, "it's about time that somebody besides me
did something around this place.""YOU," mocked Zoie, "all YOU'VE ever done was to hoodoo me from the very
beginning.""If you'd taken my advice," answered Jimmy, "and told your husband the
truth about the luncheon, there'd never have been any 'beginning.'""If, if, if," cried Zoie, in an agony of impatience, "if you'd tipped
that horrid old waiter enough, he'd never have told anyway.""I'm not buying waiters to cover up your crimes," announced Jimmy with
his most self-righteous air."You'll be buying more than that to cover up your OWN crimes before
you've finished," retorted Zoie."Before I've finished with YOU, yes," agreed Jimmy.He wheeled upon her
with increasing resentment."Do you know where I expect to end up?""I know where you OUGHT to end up," snapped Zoie."I'll finish in the electric chair," said Jimmy."I can feel blue
lightning chasing up and down my spine right now.""Well, I wish you HAD finished in the electric chair," declared Zoie,
"before you ever dragged me into that awful old restaurant."answered Jimmy shaking his fist at her across the
foot of the bed.For the want of adequate words to express his further
feelings, Jimmy was beginning to jibber, when the outer door was
heard to close, and he turned to behold Aggie entering hurriedly with
something partly concealed by her long cape."It's all right," explained Aggie triumphantly to Zoie.She threw her cape aside and disclosed the fruits of her conquest."So," snorted Jimmy in disgust, slightly miffed by the apparent ease
with which Aggie had accomplished a task about which he had made so much
ado, "you've gone into the business too, have you?"She continued in a businesslike tone to
Zoie."Thank Heaven," sighed Aggie, then she turned to Jimmy and addressed him
in rapid, decided tones."Now, dear," she said, "I'll just put the new
baby to bed, then I'll give you the other one and you can take it right
down to the mother."Jimmy made a vain start in the direction of the fire-escape.Four
detaining hands were laid upon him."Don't try anything like that," warned Aggie; "you can't get out of this
house without that baby.And Aggie sailed triumphantly out of the room to
make the proposed exchange of babies.Before Jimmy was able to suggest to himself an escape from Aggie's last
plan of action, the telephone again began to cry for attention.Neither Jimmy nor Zoie could summon courage to approach the impatient
instrument, and as usual Zoie cried frantically for Aggie.Aggie was not long in returning to the room and this time she bore in
her arms the infant so strenuously demanded by its mad mother."Here you are, Jimmy," she said; "here's the other one.Now take him
down stairs quickly before Alfred gets back."She attempted to place the
unresisting babe in Jimmy's chubby arms, but Jimmy's freedom was not to
be so easily disposed of.he exclaimed, backing away from the small creature in fear and
abhorrence, "take that bundle of rags down to the hotel office and have
that woman hystericing all over me."Oh well," answered Aggie, distracted by the persistent ringing of the
'phone, "then hold him a minute until I answer the 'phone."This at least was a compromise, and reluctantly Jimmy allowed the now
wailing infant to be placed in his arms."Jig it, Jimmy, jig it," cried Zoie.Jimmy looked down helplessly at
the baby's angry red face, but before he had made much headway with the
"jigging," Aggie returned to them, much excited by the message which she
had just received over the telephone."That mother is making a scene down stairs in the office," she said."You hear," chided Zoie, in a fury at Jimmy, "what did Aggie tell you?""If she wants this thing," maintained Jimmy, looking down at the bundle
in his arms, "she can come after it.""We can't have her up here," objected Aggie."Alfred may be back at any minute.You know what
happened the last time we tried to change them.""You can send it down the chimney, for all I care," concluded Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, her face suddenly illumined."Oh Lord," groaned Jimmy, who had come to regard any elation on Zoie's
or Aggie's part as a sure forewarner of ultimate discomfort for him.Again Aggie had recourse to the 'phone."Hello," she called to the office boy, "tell that woman to go around to
the back door, and we'll send something down to her."There was a slight
pause, then Aggie added sweetly, "Yes, tell her to wait at the foot of
the fire-escape."Zoie had already caught the drift of Aggie's intention and she now fixed
her glittering eyes upon Jimmy, who was already shifting about uneasily
and glancing at Aggie, who approached him with a business-like air."Now, dear," said Aggie, "come with me.I'll hand Baby out through the
bathroom window and you can run right down the fire-escape with him.""If I do run down the fire-escape," exclaimed Jimmy, wagging his large
head from side to side, "I'll keep right on RUNNING.That's the last
you'll ever see of me.""But, Jimmy," protested Aggie, slightly hurt by his threat, "once that
woman gets her baby you'll have no more trouble."asked Jimmy, looking from one to the other."She'll be up here if you don't hurry," urged Aggie impatiently, and
with that she pulled Jimmy toward the bedroom door."Let her come," said Jimmy, planting his feet so as to resist Aggie's
repeated tugs, "I'm going to South America.""Why will you act like this," cried Aggie, in utter desperation, "when
we have so little time?""Say," said Jimmy irrelevantly, "do you know that I haven't had any----"

"Yes," interrupted Aggie and Zoie in chorus, "we know.""How long," continued Zoie impatiently, "is it going to take you to slip
down that fire-escape?""That depends on how fast I'slip,'" answered Jimmy doggedly."You'll'slip' all right," sneered Zoie.Further exchange of pleasantries between these two antagonists was cut
short by the banging of the outside door.exclaimed Aggie, glancing nervously over her shoulder,
"there's Alfred now.Hurry, Jimmy, hurry," she cried, and with that she
fairly forced Jimmy out through the bedroom door, and followed in his
wake to see him safely down the fire-escape.CHAPTER XXVI

Zoie had barely time to arrange herself after the manner of an
interesting invalid, when Alfred entered the room in the gayest of
spirits."Hello, dearie," he cried as he crossed quickly to her side.asked Zoie faintly and she glanced uneasily toward the door,
through which Jimmy and Aggie had just disappeared."I told you I shouldn't be long," said Alfred jovially, and he implanted
a condescending kiss on her forehead.he
asked, rubbing his hands together in satisfaction."You're all cold," pouted Zoie, edging away, "and you've been drinking.""I had to have one or two with the boys," said Alfred, throwing out his
chest and strutting about the room, "but never again.From now on I cut
out all drinks and cigars.This is where I begin to live my life for our
sons."asked Zoie, as she began to see long years
of boredom stretching before her."You and our boys are one and the same, dear," answered Alfred, coming
back to her side."You mean you couldn't go on loving ME if it weren't for the BOYS?"She was beginning to realise how completely
her hold upon him depended upon her hideous deception."Of course I could, Zoie," answered Alfred, flattered by what he
considered her desire for his complete devotion, "but----"

"But not so MUCH," pouted Zoie."Well, of course, dear," admitted Alfred evasively, as he sank down upon
the edge of the bed by her side--

"You needn't say another word," interrupted Zoie, and then with a shade
of genuine repentance, she declared shame-facedly that she hadn't been
"much of a wife" to Alfred.contradicted the proud young father, "you've given me the
ONE thing that I wanted most in the world.""But you see, dear," said Zoie, as she wound her little white arms about
his neck, and looked up into his face adoringly, "YOU'VE been the 'ONE'
thing that I wanted 'MOST' and I never realised until to-night how--how
crazy you are about things.""Well," said Zoie, letting her eyes fall before his and picking at a bit
of imaginary lint on the coverlet, "babies and things.""Oh," said Alfred, and he was about to proceed when she again
interrupted him."But now that I DO realise it," continued Zoie, earnestly, her fingers
on his lips, lest he again interrupt, "if you'll only have a little
patience with me, I'll--I'll----" again her eyes fell bashfully to the
coverlet, as she considered the possibility of being ultimately obliged
to replace the bogus twins with real ones."All the patience in the world," answered Alfred, little dreaming of the
problem that confronted the contrite Zoie."That's all I ask," declared Zoie, her assurance completely restored,
"and in case anything SHOULD happen to THESE----" she glanced anxiously
toward the door through which Aggie had borne the twins."But nothing is going to happen to these, dear," interrupted Alfred,
rising and again assuming an air of fatherly protection.There, there," he added, patting her small shoulder and nodding
his head wisely."That crazy woman has got on your nerves, but you
needn't worry, I've got everything fixed.Donneghey sent a special
officer over with me.shrieked Zoie, fixing her eyes on the bedroom door, through which
Jimmy had lately disappeared and wondering whether he had yet "slipped"
down the fire-escape."Yes," continued Alfred, walking up and down the floor with a masterly
stride."If that woman is caught hanging around here again, she'll get a
little surprise.My boys are safe now, God bless them!"Then reminded of
the fact that he had not seen them since his return, he started quickly
toward the bedroom door."I'll just have a look at the little rascals,"
he decided.She caught Alfred's arm as he passed the side of
her bed, and clung to him in desperation.Alfred looked down at her in surprise.She turned her face toward the door, and called lustily, "Aggie!questioned Alfred, thinking Zoie suddenly ill, "can
I get you something?"Before Zoie was obliged to reply, Aggie answered her summons.she asked, glancing inquiringly into Zoie's distressed
face."Alfred's here," said Zoie, with a sickly smile as she stroked his hand
and glanced meaningly at Aggie.cried Aggie, and involuntarily she took a step backward,
as though to guard the bedroom door."Yes," said Alfred, mistaking Aggie's surprise for a compliment to his
resource; "and now, Aggie, if you'll just stay with Zoie for a minute
I'll have a look at my boys."exclaimed Aggie, nervously, and she placed herself again in
front of the bedroom door.Alfred was plainly annoyed by her proprietory air."I'll not WAKE them," persisted Alfred, "I just wish to have a LOOK at
them," and with that he again made a move toward the door."But Alfred," protested Zoie, still clinging to his hand, "you're not
going to leave me again--so soon."Alfred was becoming more and more restive under the seeming absurdity of
their persistent opposition, but before he could think of a polite way
of over-ruling them, Aggie continued persuasively."You stay with Zoie," she said."I'll bring the boys in here and you can
both have a look at them.""But Aggie," argued Alfred, puzzled by her illogical behaviour, "would
it be wise to wake them?""Now you stay here and I'll get them."Before Alfred could protest further she was out of the room and the door
had closed behind her, so he resigned himself to her decision, banished
his temporary annoyance at her obstinacy, and glanced about the room
with a new air of proprietorship."This is certainly a great night, Zoie," he said."It certainly is," acquiesced Zoie, with an over emphasis that made
Alfred turn to her with new concern."I'm afraid that mad woman made you very nervous, dear," he said.Zoie's nerves were destined to bear still further strain, for at that
moment, there came a sharp ring at the door.Beside herself with anxiety Zoie threw her arms about Alfred, who had
advanced to soothe her, drew him down by her side and buried her head on
his breast."You ARE jumpy," said Alfred, and at that instant a wrangle of loud
voices, and a general commotion was heard in the outer hall.asked Alfred, endeavouring to disentangle himself from Zoie's
frantic embrace.Zoie clung to him so tightly that he was unable to rise, but his alert
ear caught the sound of a familiar voice rising above the din of dispute
in the hallway."That sounds like the officer," he exclaimed.cried Zoie, and she wound her arms more tightly about
him.CHAPTER XXVII

Propelled by a large red fist, attached to the back of his badly wilted
collar, the writhing form of Jimmy was now thrust through the outer
door."Let go of me," shouted the hapless Jimmy.The answer was a spasmodic shaking administered by the fist; then a
large burly officer, carrying a small babe in his arms, shoved the
reluctant Jimmy into the centre of the room and stood guard over him."I got him for you, sir," announced the officer proudly, to the
astonished Alfred, who had just managed to untwine Zoie's arms and to
struggle to his feet.Alfred's eyes fell first upon the dejected Jimmy, then they travelled to
the bundle of long clothes in the officer's arms.He snatched the infant from the officer
and pressed him jealously to his breast."I don't understand," he said,
gazing at the officer in stupefaction.asked the officer, nodding toward the unfortunate
Jimmy."I caught him slipping down your fire-escape.""I KNEW it," exclaimed Zoie in a rage, and she cast a vindictive look at
Jimmy for his awkwardness.Alfred
turned again to the officer, then to Jimmy, who was still flashing
defiance into the officer's threatening eyes.What's the matter with you,
Jimmy?This is the third time that you have tried to take my baby out
into the night.""Then you've had trouble with him before?"He
studied Jimmy with new interest, proud in the belief that he had brought
a confirmed "baby-snatcher" to justice."I've had a little trouble myself," declared Jimmy hotly, now resolved
to make a clean breast of it."I'm not asking about your troubles," interrupted the officer savagely,
and Jimmy felt the huge creature's obnoxious fingers tightening again on
his collar."Go ahead, sir," said the officer to Alfred."Well," began Alfred, nodding toward the now livid Jimmy, "he was out
with my boy when I arrived.I stopped him from going out with him
a second time, and now you, officer, catch him slipping down the
fire-escape.I don't know what to say," he finished weakly."_I_ do," exclaimed Jimmy, feeling more and more like a high explosive,
"and I'll say it."And before Jimmy could get further,
Alfred resumed with fresh vehemence."He's supposed to be a friend of mine," he explained to the officer, as
he nodded toward the wriggling Jimmy."He was all right when I left him
a few months ago.""You'll think I'm all right again," shouted Jimmy, trying to get free
from the officer, "before I've finished telling all I----"

"That won't help any," interrupted the officer firmly, and with another
twist of Jimmy's badly wilted collar he turned to Alfred with his most
civil manner, "What shall I do with him, sir?""I don't know," said Alfred, convinced that his friend was a fit subject
for a straight jacket."It's absurd," cried Zoie, on the verge of hysterics, and in utter
despair of ever disentangling the present complication without
ultimately losing Alfred, "you're all absurd," she cried wildly.exclaimed Alfred, turning upon her in amazement, "what do you
mean?""It's a joke," said Zoie, without the slightest idea of where the joke
lay."If you had any sense you could see it.""I DON'T see it," said Alfred, with hurt dignity."Neither do I," said Jimmy, with boiling resentment."Can you call it a joke," asked Alfred, incredulously, "to have our
boy----" He stopped suddenly, remembering that there was a companion
piece to this youngster.he exclaimed, "our other
boy----" He rushed to the crib, found it empty, and turned a terrified
face to Zoie."Now, Alfred," pleaded Zoie, "don't get excited; he's all right."Zoie did not know, but at that moment her eyes fell upon Jimmy, and as
usual he was the source of an inspiration for her."Jimmy never cared for the other one," she said, "did you, Jimmy?"Alfred turned to the officer, with a tone of command."Wait," he said,
then he started toward the bedroom door to make sure that his other
boy was quite safe.The picture that confronted him brought the hair
straight up on his head.True to her promise, and ignorant of Jimmy's
return with the first baby, Aggie had chosen this ill-fated moment to
appear on the threshold with one babe on each arm."Here they are," she said graciously, then stopped in amazement at sight
of the horrified Alfred, clasping a third infant to his breast.exclaimed Alfred, stroking his forehead with his unoccupied
hand, and gazing at what he firmly believed must be an apparition,
"THOSE aren't MINE," he pointed to the two red mites in Aggie's arms.stammered Aggie for the want of something better
to say.Then he turned in appeal to his young wife,
whose face had now become utterly expressionless.There was an instant's pause, then the blood returned to Zoie's face and
she proved herself the artist that Alfred had once declared her."OURS, dear," she murmured softly, with a bashful droop of her lids.persisted Alfred, pointing to the baby in his arms, and
feeling sure that his mind was about to give way."Why--why--why," stuttered Zoie, "THAT'S the JOKE."echoed Alfred, looking as though he found it anything but
such."Yes," added Aggie, sharing Zoie's desperation to get out of their
temporary difficulty, no matter at what cost in the future.stammered Alfred, "what IS there to tell?""Why, you see," said Aggie, growing more enthusiastic with each
elaboration of Zoie's lie, "we didn't dare to break it to you too
suddenly."gasped Alfred; a new light was beginning to dawn on
his face."So," concluded Zoie, now thoroughly at home in the new situation, "we
asked Jimmy to take THAT one OUT."Jimmy cast an inscrutable glance in Zoie's direction.Was it possible
that she was at last assisting him out of a difficulty?"Yes," confirmed Aggie, with easy confidence, "we wanted you to get used
to the idea gradually."He was afraid to allow his mind to accept
too suddenly the whole significance of their disclosure, lest his joy
over-power him."You--you--do--don't mean----" he stuttered."Yes, dear," sighed Zoie, with the face of an angel, and then with a
languid sigh, she sank back contentedly on her pillows.cried Alfred, now delirious with delight."Give
them to me," he called to Aggie, and he snatched the surprised infants
savagely from her arms."Give me ALL of them, ALL of them."He clasped
the three babes to his breast, then dashed to the bedside of the
unsuspecting Zoie and covered her small face with rapturous kisses.Feeling the red faces of the little strangers in such close proximity to
hers, Zoie drew away from them with abhorrence, but unconscious of her
unmotherly action, Alfred continued his mad career about the room, his
heart overflowing with gratitude toward Zoie in particular and mankind
in general.Finding Aggie in the path of his wild jubilee, he treated
that bewildered young matron to an unwelcome kiss.A proceeding which
Jimmy did not at all approve.Hardly had Aggie recovered from her surprise when the disgruntled
Jimmy was startled out of his dark mood by the supreme insult of a
loud resounding kiss implanted on his own cheek by his excitable young
friend.Jimmy raised his arm to resist a second assault, and Alfred
veered off in the direction of the officer, who stepped aside just in
time to avoid similar demonstration from the indiscriminating young
father.Finding a wide circle prescribed about himself and the babies, Alfred
suddenly stopped and gazed about from one astonished face to the other."Well," said the officer, regarding Alfred with an injured air,
and feeling much downcast at being so ignominiously deprived of his
short-lived heroism in capturing a supposed criminal, "if this is all a
joke, I'll let the woman go.""The woman," repeated Alfred; "what woman?""I nabbed a woman at the foot of the fire-escape," explained the
officer.Zoie and Aggie glanced at each other inquiringly."I thought
she might be an accomplice."His manner was
becoming more paternal, not to say condescending, with the arrival of
each new infant."Don't be silly, Alfred," snapped Zoie, really ashamed that Alfred was
making such an idiot of himself."Oh, that's it," said Alfred, with a wise nod of comprehension; "the
nurse, then she's in the joke too?""You're all in it," he exclaimed, flattered to think
that they had considered it necessary to combine the efforts of so many
of them to deceive him."Yes," assented Jimmy sadly, "we are all 'in it.'""Well, she's a great actress," decided Alfred, with the air of a
connoisseur."She sure is," admitted Donneghey, more and more disgruntled as he felt
his reputation for detecting fraud slipping from him."She put up a
phoney story about the kid being hers," he added."But I could tell she
wasn't on the level.Good-night, sir," he called to Alfred, and ignoring
Jimmy, he passed quickly from the room."Oh, officer," Alfred called after him.I'll
be down later and fix things up with you."Again Alfred gave his whole
attention to his new-found family.He leaned over the cradle and gazed
ecstatically into the three small faces below his."This is too much,"
he murmured."Much too much," agreed Jimmy, who was now sitting hunched up on the
couch in his customary attitude of gloom."You were right not to break it to me too suddenly," said Alfred, and
with his arms encircling three infants he settled himself on the couch
by Jimmy's side."You're a cute one," he continued to Jimmy, who was
edging away from the three mites with aversion.In the absence of any
answer from Jimmy, Alfred appealed to Zoie, "Isn't he a cute one, dear?""Oh, yes, VERY," answered Zoie, sarcastically.Shutting his lips tight and glancing at Zoie with a determined effort at
self restraint, Jimmy rose from the couch and started toward the door."If you women are done with me," he said, "I'll clear out."exclaimed Alfred, rising quickly and placing himself
between his old friend and the door."What a chance," and he laughed
boisterously."You're not going to get out of my sight this night," he
declared."I'm just beginning to appreciate all you've done for me.""So am I," assented Jimmy, and unconsciously his hand sought the spot
where his dinner should have been, but Alfred was not to be resisted."A man needs someone around," he declared, "when he's going through a
thing like this.I need all of you, all of you," and with his eyes he
embraced the weary circle of faces about him."I feel as though I could
go out of my head," he explained and with that he began tucking the
three small mites in the pink and white crib designed for but one.Zoie regarded him with a bored expression'

"You act as though you WERE out of your head," she commented, but Alfred
did not heed her.He was now engaged in the unhoped for bliss of singing
three babies to sleep with one lullaby.The other occupants of the room were just beginning to relax and to show
some resemblance to their natural selves, when their features were again
simultaneously frozen by a ring at the outside door.CHAPTER XXVIII

Annoyed at being interrupted in the midst of his lullaby, to three,
Alfred looked up to see Maggie, hatless and out of breath, bursting into
the room, and destroying what was to him an ideally tranquil home scene.But Maggie paid no heed to Alfred's look of inquiry.She made directly
for the side of Zoie's bed."If you plaze, mum," she panted, looking down at Zoie, and wringing her
hands.asked Aggie, who had now reached the side of the bed."'Scuse me for comin' right in"--Maggie was breathing hard--"but me
mother sint me to tell you that me father is jus afther comin' home from
work, and he's fightin' mad about the babies, mum."cautioned Aggie and Zoie, as they glanced nervously toward
Alfred who was rising from his place beside the cradle with increasing
interest in Maggie's conversation.he repeated, "your father is mad about babies?""It's all right, dear," interrupted Zoie nervously; "you see," she
went on to explain, pointing toward the trembling Maggie, "this is our
washerwoman's little girl.Our washerwoman has had twins, too, and it
made the wash late, and her husband is angry about it.""Oh," said Alfred, with a comprehensive nod, but Maggie was not to be so
easily disposed of."If you please, mum," she objected, "it ain't about the wash.repeated Alfred, drawing himself up in the fond conviction that
all his heirs were boys, "No wonder your pa's angry.Come now," he said to Maggie, patting the child on the shoulder and
regarding her indulgently, "you go straight home and tell your father
that what HE needs is BOYS.""Well, of course, sir," answered the bewildered Maggie, thinking that
Alfred meant to reflect upon the gender of the offspring donated by her
parents, "if you ain't afther likin' girls, me mother sint the money
back," and with that she began to feel for the pocket in her red flannel
petticoat.repeated Alfred, in a puzzled way, "what money?"It was again Zoie's time to think quickly."The money for the wash, dear," she explained.retorted Alfred, positively beaming generosity, "who talks
of money at such a time as this?"And taking a ten dollar bill from his
pocket, he thrust it in Maggie's outstretched hand, while she was trying
to return to him the original purchase money."Here," he said to the
astonished girl, "you take this to your father.Tell him I sent it to
him for his babies.Tell him to start a bank account with it."This was clearly not a case with which one small addled mind could deal,
or at least, so Maggie decided.She had a hazy idea that Alfred was
adding something to the original purchase price of her young sisters,
but she was quite at a loss to know how to refuse the offer of such
a "grand 'hoigh" gentleman, even though her failure to do so would no
doubt result in a beating when she reached home.She stared at Alfred
undecided what to do, the money still lay in her outstretched hand."I'm afraid Pa'll niver loike it, sir," she said.exclaimed Alfred in high feather, and he himself closed her
red little fingers over the bill, "he's GOT to like it.Now you run along," he concluded to Maggie, as he urged her
toward the door, "and tell him what I say.""Yes, sir," murmured Maggie, far from sharing Alfred's enthusiasm.Feeling no desire to renew his acquaintance with Maggie, particularly
under Alfred's watchful eye, Jimmy had sought his old refuge, the high
backed chair.As affairs progressed and there seemed no doubt of Zoie's
being able to handle the situation to the satisfaction of all concerned,
Jimmy allowed exhaustion and the warmth of the firelight to have their
way with him.His mind wandered toward other things and finally into
space.His head dropped lower and lower on his chest; his breathing
became laboured--so laboured in fact that it attracted the attention of
Maggie, who was about to pass him on her way to the door.Then coming close to the
side of the unsuspecting sleeper, she hissed a startling message in his
ear."Me mother said to tell you that me fadder's hoppin' mad at you,
sir."He studied the young person at his
elbow, then he glanced at Alfred, utterly befuddled as to what had
happened while he had been on a journey to happier scenes.Apparently
Maggie was waiting for an answer to something, but to what?Jimmy
thought he detected an ominous look in Alfred's eyes.Letting his hand
fall over the arm of the chair so that Alfred could not see it, Jimmy
began to make frantic signals to Maggie to depart; she stared at him the
harder."Go away," whispered Jimmy, but Maggie did not move.he
said, and waved her off with his hand.Puzzled by Jimmy's sudden aversion to this apparently harmless child,
Alfred turned to Maggie with a puckered brow.For once Jimmy found it in his heart to be grateful to Zoie for the
prompt answer that came from her direction."The wash, dear," said Zoie to Alfred; "Jimmy had to go after the wash,"
and then with a look which Maggie could not mistake for an invitation to
stop longer, Zoie called to her haughtily, "You needn't wait, Maggie; we
understand.""Sure, an' it's more 'an I do," answered Maggie, and shaking her head
sadly, she slipped from the room.But Alfred could not immediately dismiss from his mind the picture of
Maggie's inhuman parent."Just fancy," he said, turning his head to one side meditatively, "fancy
any man not liking to be the father of twins," and with that he again
bent over the cradle and surveyed its contents."Think, Jimmy," he said,
when he had managed to get the three youngsters in his arms, "just think
of the way THAT father feels, and then think of the way _I_ feel.""And then think of the way _I_ feel," grumbled Jimmy.exclaimed Alfred; "what have you to feel about?"Before Jimmy could answer, the air was rent by a piercing scream and a
crash of glass from the direction of the inner rooms.whispered Aggie, with an anxious glance toward Zoie."Sounded like breaking glass," said Alfred.exclaimed Zoie, for want of anything better to suggest.repeated Alfred with a superior air; "nonsense!Here," he said, turning to Jimmy, "you hold the boys and I'll go
see----" and before Jimmy was aware of the honour about to be thrust
upon him, he felt three red, spineless morsels, wriggling about in his
arms.He made what lap he could for the armful, and sat up in a stiff,
strained attitude on the edge of the couch.In the meantime, Alfred had
strode into the adjoining room with the air of a conqueror.Aggie looked
at Zoie, with dreadful foreboding.shrieked the voice of the Italian mother from the adjoining
room.Regardless of the discomfort of his three disgruntled charges, Jimmy
began to circle the room.So agitated was his mind that he could
scarcely hear Aggie, who was reporting proceedings from her place at the
bedroom door."She's come up the fire-escape," cried Aggie; "she's beating Alfred to
death."shrieked Zoie, making a flying leap from her coverlets."She's locking him in the bathroom," declared Aggie, and with that she
disappeared from the room, bent on rescue.cried Zoie, tragically, and she started in pursuit of
Aggie."Wait a minute," called Jimmy, who had not yet been able to find
a satisfactory place in which to deposit his armful of clothes and
humanity."Eat 'em," was Zoie's helpful retort, as the trailing end of her
negligee disappeared from the room.CHAPTER XXIX

Now, had Jimmy been less perturbed during the latter part of this
commotion, he might have heard the bell of the outside door, which
had been ringing violently for some minutes.As it was, he was wholly
unprepared for the flying advent of Maggie."Oh, plaze, sir," she cried, pointing with trembling fingers toward
the babes in Jimmy's arms, "me fadder's coming right behind me.He's
a-lookin' for you sir.""For me," murmured Jimmy, wondering vaguely why everybody on earth
seemed to be looking for HIM."Put 'em down, sir," cried Maggie, still pointing to the three babies,
"put 'em down.asked Jimmy, now utterly confused as to which way to
turn."There," said Maggie, and she pointed to the cradle beneath his very
eyes."Of course," said Jimmy vapidly, and he sank on his knees and strove to
let the wobbly creatures down easily.And with that
disconcerting warning, she too deserted him.Jimmy rose very cautiously from the
cradle, his eyes sought the armchair.He
looked towards the opposite door; beyond that was the mad Italian woman.His one chance lay in slipping unnoticed through the hallway; he made
a determined dash in that direction, but no sooner had he put his head
through the door, than he drew it back quickly.The conversation between
O'Flarety and the maid in the hallway was not reassuring.Jimmy decided
to take a chance with the Italian mother, and as fast as he could, he
streaked it toward the opposite door.The shrieks and denunciations that
he met from this direction were more disconcerting than those of
the Irish father.For an instant he stood in the centre of the room,
wavering as to which side to surrender himself.The thunderous tones of the enraged father drew nearer; he threw himself
on the floor and attempted to roll under the bed; the space between the
railing and the floor was far too narrow.Why had he disregarded Aggie's
advice as to diet?The knob of the door handle was turning--he vaulted
into the bed and drew the covers over his head just as O'Flarety,
trembling with excitement, and pursued by Maggie, burst into the room."Lave go of me," cried O'Flarety to Maggie, who clung to his arm in a
vain effort to soothe him, and flinging her off, he made straight for
the bed."Ah," he cried, gazing with dilated nostrils at the trembling object
beneath the covers, "there you are, mum," and he shook his fist above
what he believed to be the cowardly Mrs."'Tis well ye may cover
up your head," said he, "for shame on yez!Me wife may take in washing,
but when I comes home at night I wants me kids, and I'll be after havin'
'em too.Then getting no response from the
agitated covers, he glanced wildly about the room.he exclaimed as his eyes fell on the crib; but he stopped short in
astonishment, when upon peering into it, he found not one, or two, but
three "barren.""They're child stalers, that's what they are," he declared to Maggie,
as he snatched Bridget and Norah to his no doubt comforting breast."Me
little Biddy," he crooned over his much coveted possession."Me little
Norah," he added fondly, looking down at his second.The thought of his
narrow escape from losing these irreplaceable treasures rekindled
his wrath.Again he strode toward the bed and looked down at the now
semi-quiet comforter."The black heart of ye, mum," he roared, then ordering Maggie to give
back "every penny of that shameless creetur's money" he turned toward
the door.So intense had been O'Flarety's excitement and so engrossed was he in
his denunciation that he had failed to see the wild-eyed Italian woman
rushing toward him from the opposite door.cried the frenzied woman and, to O'Flarety's astonishment,
she laid two strong hands upon his arm and drew him round until he faced
her.she asked, then peering into
the face of the infant nearest to her, she uttered a disappointed
moan.She scanned the face of the second
infant--again she moaned.Having begun to identify this hysterical creature as the possible mother
of the third infant, O'Flarety jerked his head in the direction of the
cradle."I guess you'll find what you're lookin' for in there," he said.Then
bidding Maggie to "git along out o' this" and shrugging his shoulders
to convey his contempt for the fugitive beneath the coverlet, he swept
quickly from the room.Clasping her long-sought darling to her heart and weeping with delight,
the Italian mother was about to follow O'Flarety through the door when
Zoie staggered into the room, weak and exhausted.called the indignant Zoie to the departing mother."How dare
you lock my husband in the bathroom?"She pointed to the key, which the
woman still unconsciously clasped in her hand."Give me that key," she
demanded, "give it to me this instant.""Take your horrid old key," said the mother, and she threw it on the
floor."If you ever try to get my baby again, I'll lock your husband in
JAIL," and murmuring excited maledictions in her native tongue, she took
her welcome departure.Zoie stooped for the key, one hand to her giddy head, but Aggie, who had
just returned to the room, reached the key first and volunteered to go
to the aid of the captive Alfred, who was pounding desperately on the
bathroom door and demanding his instant release."I'll let him out," said Aggie."You get into bed," and she slipped
quickly from the room.Utterly exhausted and half blind with fatigue Zoie lifted the coverlet
and slipped beneath it.Her first sensation was of touching something
rough and scratchy, then came the awful conviction that the thing
against which she lay was alive.Without stopping to investigate the identity of her uninvited
bed-fellow, or even daring to look behind her, Zoie fled from the room
emitting a series of screams that made all her previous efforts in that
direction seem mere baby cries.So completely had Jimmy been enveloped
in the coverlets and for so long a time that he had acquired a vague
feeling of aloftness toward the rest of his fellows, and had lost all
knowledge of their goings and comings.But when his unexpected companion
was thrust upon him he was galvanised into sudden action by her scream,
and swathed in a large pink comforter, he rolled ignominiously from the
upper side of the bed, where he lay on the floor panting and enmeshed,
awaiting further developments.Of one thing he was certain, a great deal
had transpired since he had sought the friendly solace of the covers and
he had no mind to lose so good a friend as the pink comforter.By the
time he had summoned sufficient courage to peep from under its edge, a
babel of voices was again drawing near, and he hastily drew back in his
shell and waited.Not daring to glance at the scene of her fright, Zoie pushed Aggie
before her into the room and demanded that she look in the bed.Seeing the bed quite empty and noticing nothing unusual in the fact that
the pink comforter, along with other covers, had slipped down behind it,
Aggie hastened to reassure her terrified friend."You imagined it, Zoie," she declared, "look for yourself."Zoie's small face peeped cautiously around the edge of the doorway."Well, perhaps I did," she admitted; then she slipped gingerly into the
room, "my nerves are jumping like fizzy water."They were soon to "jump" more, for at this instant, Alfred, burning with
anger at the indignity of having been locked in the bathroom, entered
the room, demanding to know the whereabouts of the lunatic mother, who
had dared to make him a captive in his own house.he called to Zoie and Aggie, and his eye roved wildly
about the room.Then his mind reverted with anxiety to his newly
acquired offspring.he cried, and he rushed toward the crib."Not ALL of them," said Zoie."All," insisted Alfred, and his hands went distractedly toward his head.Zoie and Aggie looked at each other in a dazed way.They had a hazy
recollection of having seen one babe disappear with the Italian woman,
but what had become of the other two?"I don't know," said Zoie, with the first truth she had spoken that
night, "I left them with Jimmy."shrieked Alfred, and a diabolical light lit his features.he snorted, with sudden comprehension, "then he's at it again.And
with that decision he started toward the outer door.protested Zoie, really alarmed by the look that she saw on
his face.Alfred turned to his trembling wife with suppressed excitement, and
patted her shoulder condescendingly."Control yourself, my dear," he said."Control yourself; I'll get
your babies for you--trust me, I'll get them.And then," he added with
parting emphasis from the doorway, "I'll SETTLE WITH JIMMY!"By uncovering one eye, Jimmy could now perceive that Zoie and Aggie
were engaged in a heated argument at the opposite side of the room.By
uncovering one ear he learned that they were arranging a line of action
for him immediately upon his reappearance.He determined not to wait for
the details.Fixing himself cautiously on all fours, and making sure that he was
well covered by the pink comforter, he began to crawl slowly toward the
bedroom door.Turning away from Aggie with an impatient exclamation, Zoie suddenly
beheld what seemed to her a large pink monster with protruding claws
wriggling its way hurriedly toward the inner room.she screamed, and pointing in horror toward the dreadful
creature now dragging itself across the threshold, she sank fainting
into Aggie's outstretched arms.CHAPTER XXX

Having dragged the limp form of her friend to the near-by couch, Aggie
was bending over her to apply the necessary restoratives, when Alfred
returned in triumph.He was followed by the officer in whose arms were
three infants, and behind whom was the irate O'Flarety, the hysterical
Italian woman, and last of all, Maggie."Bring them all in here, officer," called Alfred over his shoulder."I'll soon prove to you whose babies those are."Then turning to Aggie,
who stood between him and the fainting Zoie he cried triumphantly,
"I've got them Aggie, I've got them.""She's fainted," said Aggie, and stepping from in front of the young
wife, she pointed toward the couch.cried Alfred, with deep concern as he rushed to Zoie
and began frantically patting her hands.Then he turned to the officer, his sense of injury welling high within
him, "You see what these people have done to my wife?Ignoring the uncomplimentary remarks of O'Flarety, he again bent over
Zoie."Rouse yourself, my dear," he begged of her.snorted O'Flarety, unable longer to control his pent up
indignation."I'll let you know when I want to hear from you," snarled the officer to
O'Flarety."But they're NOT her babies," protested the Italian woman desperately."Cut it," shouted the officer, and with low mutterings, the outraged
parents were obliged to bide their time.Lifting Zoie to a sitting posture Alfred fanned her gently until she
regained her senses."Your babies are all right," he assured her."I've
brought them all back to you."gasped Zoie weakly, and she wondered what curious fate had been
intervening to assist Alfred in such a prodigious undertaking."Yes, dear," said Alfred, "every one," and he pointed toward the three
infants in the officer's arms.Zoie turned her eyes upon what SEEMED to her numberless red faces.she moaned and again she swooned."I told you she'd be afraid to face us," shouted the now triumphant
O'Flarety.retorted the still credulous Alfred, "how dare you
persecute this poor demented mother?"Alfred's persistent solicitude for Zoie was too much for the resentful
Italian woman."She didn't persecute me, oh no!"Again Zoie was reviving and again Alfred lifted her in his arms and
begged her to assure the officer that the babies in question were hers."Let's hear her SAY it," demanded O'Flarety."You SHALL hear her," answered Alfred, with confidence.Then he beckoned
to the officer to approach, explaining that Zoie was very weak."Sure," said the officer; then planting himself directly in front of
Zoie's half closed eyes, he thrust the babies upon her attention.Zoie opened her eyes to see three small red faces immediately opposite
her own.she cried, with a frantic wave of her arm, "take them
away!"This hateful reminder brought
Alfred again to the protection of his young and defenceless wife."The excitement has unnerved her," he said to the officer."Ain't you about done with my kids?"asked O'Flarety, marvelling how any
man with so little penetration as the officer, managed to hold down a
"good payin' job.""What do you want for your proof anyway?"But Alfred's
faith in the validity of his new parenthood was not to be so easily
shaken."My wife is in no condition to be questioned," he declared."She's out
of her head, and if you don't----"

He stepped suddenly, for without warning, the door was thrown open and a
second officer strode into their midst dragging by the arm the reluctant
Jimmy."I guess I've got somethin' here that you folks need in your business,"
he called, nodding toward the now utterly demoralised Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, having at last got her breath.cried Alfred, bearing down upon the panting Jimmy with a
ferocious expression."I caught him slipping down the fire-escape," explained the officer.exclaimed Aggie and Alfred in tones of deep reproach."Jimmy," said Alfred, coming close to his friend, and fixing his eyes
upon him in a determined effort to control the poor creature's fast
failing faculties, "you know the truth of this thing.You are the one
who sent me that telegram, you are the one who told me that I was a
father."asked Aggie, trying to protect her dejected
spouse."Of course I am," replied Alfred, with every confidence, "but I have to
prove it to the officer.Then turning to
the uncomfortable man at his side, he demanded imperatively, "Tell the
officer the truth, you idiot.Am I a father or am
I not?""If you're depending on ME for your future offspring," answered Jimmy,
wagging his head with the air of a man reckless of consequences, "you
are NOT a father."gasped Alfred, and he stared at his friend in
bewilderment."Ask them," answered Jimmy, and he nodded toward Zoie and Aggie.Alfred bent over the form of the again prostrate Zoie."My darling,"
he entreated, "rouse yourself.""Now," said
Alfred, with enforced self-control, "you must look the officer squarely
in the eye and tell him whose babies those are," and he nodded toward
the officer, who was now beginning to entertain grave doubts on the
subject.cried Zoie, too exhausted for further lying.exclaimed Alfred, his hand on his forehead."I only borrowed them," said Zoie, "to get you home," and with that she
sank back on the couch and closed her eyes.cried the triumphant O'Flarety."I guess they're your'n all right," admitted the officer doggedly, and
he grudgingly released the three infants to their rightful parents."I guess they'd better be," shouted O'Flarety; then he and the Italian
woman made for the door with their babes pressed close to their hearts.O'Flarety turned in the doorway and raised a warning fist."If you don't leave my kids alone, you'll GIT 'an understanding.'""On your way," commanded the officer to the pair of them, and together
with Maggie and the officer, they disappeared forever from the Hardy
household.he exclaimed; then he turned to
Jimmy who was still in the custody of the second officer: "If I'm not a
father, what am I?""I'd hate to tell you," was Jimmy's unsympathetic reply, and in utter
dejection Alfred sank on the foot of the bed and buried his head in his
hands."What shall I do with this one, sir?"asked the officer, undecided as to
Jimmy's exact standing in the household."Shoot him, for all I care," groaned Alfred, and he rocked to and fro.exclaimed Aggie, then she signalled to the officer to
go."No more of your funny business," said the officer with a parting nod at
Jimmy and a vindictive light in his eyes when he remembered the bruises
that Jimmy had left on his shins.said Aggie sympathetically, and she pressed her hot face
against his round apoplectic cheek.And after all you
have done for us!""Yes," sneered Zoie, having regained sufficient strength to stagger to
her feet, "he's done a lot, hasn't he?"And then forgetting that her
original adventure with Jimmy which had brought about such disastrous
results was still unknown to Aggie and Alfred, she concluded bitterly,
"All this would never have happened, if it hadn't been for Jimmy and his
horrid old luncheon."This was too much, and just as he had seemed to be
well out of complications for the remainder of his no doubt short life.He turned to bolt for the door but Aggie's eyes were upon him.exclaimed Aggie and she regarded him with a puzzled frown.Zoie's hand was already over her lips, but too late.Recovering from his somewhat bewildering sense of loss, Alfred, too, was
now beginning to sit up and take notice.Zoie gazed from Alfred to Aggie, then at Jimmy, then resolving to make
a clean breast of the matter, she sidled toward Alfred with her most
ingratiating manner."Now, Alfred," she purred, as she endeavoured to act one arm about
his unsuspecting neck, "if you'll only listen, I'll tell you the REAL
TRUTH."A wild despairing cry from Alfred, a dash toward the door by Jimmy, and
a determined effort on Aggie's part to detain her spouse, temporarily
interrupted Zoie's narrative.But in spite of these discouragements, Zoie did eventually tell Alfred
the real truth, and before the sun had risen on the beginning of another
day, she had added to her confession, promises whose happy fulfillment
was evidenced for many years after by the chatter of glad young voices,
up and down the stairway of Alfred's new suburban home, and the flutter
of golden curls in and out amongst the sunlight and shadows of his
ample, well kept grounds.[Illustration]

    The Brownies through a village bound,
    Paused in their run to look around,
    And wondered why the central square
    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: "Without delay we'll go
    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest
    So straight and high above the rest,
    We soon can choose a flag-pole there
    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend
    To trim it off from end to end,
    To peel it smooth and paint it white,
    And hoist it in the square to-night."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then to the woods the Brownies ran
    At once to carry out their plan;
    While some ran here and there with speed
    For implements to serve their need,
    Some rambled through the forest free
    To find the proper kind of tree,
    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood
    To learn if it was sound and good,
                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,
                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,
                                   To work the active Brownies fell;
      And soon with sticks beneath their load,
      The band in grand procession strode;
        It gave them quite enough to do
        To safely put the project through,
        But when they reached the square, at last,
        Some ropes around the pole were passed
        And from the tops of maples tall
        A crowd began to pull and haul,
        While others gathered at the base
        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For Brownies seldom idle stand
    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round
    They come from secret haunts profound,
    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,
    They clamber over fence and wall;
    And soon on objects here and there
    That hold positions high in air,
    And most attract the human eye,
    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire
    They climb the tall cathedral spire;
    When all the town is still below,
    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,
    By light of moon, and stars alone,
    They dust the marble and the stone,
          And with their brushes, small and great,
          They paint and gild the dial-plate;
          And bring the figures plain in sight
          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place._Man._ No more--I must not hear thee.[_Going._

 _At._                    How!You must--you shall--nay, nay return, my Lord--
 Oh, fly not from me!----look upon my woes,
 And imitate the mercy of the gods:
 'Tis not their thunder that excites our reverence,
 'Tis their mild mercy, and forgiving love.'Twill add a brighter lustre to thy laurels,
 When men shall say, and proudly point thee out,
 "Behold the Consul!--He who sav'd his friend."Oh, what a tide of joy will overwhelm thee!_Man._ Thy father scorns his liberty and life,
 Nor will accept of either at the expense
 Of honour, virtue, glory, faith, and Rome._At._ Think you behold the god-like Regulus
 The prey of unrelenting savage foes,
 Ingenious only in contriving ill:----
 Eager to glut their hunger of revenge,
 They'll plot such new, such dire, unheard-of tortures--
 Such dreadful, and such complicated vengeance,
 As e'en the Punic annals have not known;
 And, as they heap fresh torments on his head,
 They'll glory in their genius for destruction.Manlius--now methinks I see my father--
 My faithful fancy, full of his idea,
 Presents him to me--mangled, gash'd, and torn--
 Stretch'd on the rack in writhing agony--
 The torturing pincers tear his quivering flesh,
 While the dire murderers smile upon his wounds,
 His groans their music, and his pangs their sport.And if they lend some interval of ease,
 Some dear-bought intermission, meant to make
 The following pang more exquisitely felt,
 Th' insulting executioners exclaim,
 --"Now, Roman!_Man._ Repress thy sorrows----

 _At._                     Can the friend of Regulus
 Advise his daughter not to mourn his fate?is friendship when compar'd
 To ties of blood--to nature's powerful impulse!Yes--she asserts her empire in my soul,
 'Tis Nature pleads--she will--she must be heard;
 With warm, resistless eloquence she pleads.--
 Ah, thou art soften'd!--see--the Consul yields--
 The feelings triumph--tenderness prevails--
 The Roman is subdued--the daughter conquers![_Catching hold of his robe._

 _Man._ Ah, hold me not!--I must not, cannot stay,
 The softness of thy sorrow is contagious;
 I, too, may feel when I should only reason.I dare not hear thee--Regulus and Rome,
 The patriot and the friend--all, all forbid it.[_Breaks from her, and exit._

 _At._ O feeble grasp!--and is he gone, quite gone?Hold, hold thy empire, Reason, firmly hold it,
 Or rather quit at once thy feeble throne,
 Since thou but serv'st to show me what I've lost,
 To heighten all the horrors that await me;
 To summon up a wild distracted crowd
 Of fatal images, to shake my soul,
 To scare sweet peace, and banish hope itself.thou pale-ey'd spectre, come,
 For thou shalt be Attilia's inmate now,
 And thou shalt grow, and twine about her heart,
 And she shall be so much enamour'd of thee,
 The pageant Pleasure ne'er shall interpose
 Her gaudy presence to divide you more.[_Stands in an attitude of silent grief._


    _Enter_ LICINIUS._Lic._ At length I've found thee--ah, my charming maid!How have I sought thee out with anxious fondness!she hears me not.----My best Attilia!Still, still she hears not----'tis Licinius speaks,
 He comes to soothe the anguish of thy spirit,
 And hush thy tender sorrows into peace._At._ Who's he that dares assume the voice of love,
 And comes unbidden to these dreary haunts?Steals on the sacred treasury of woe,
 And breaks the league Despair and I have made?_Lic._ 'Tis one who comes the messenger of heav'n,
 To talk of peace, of comfort, and of joy._At._ Didst thou not mock me with the sound of joy?Thou little know'st the anguish of my soul,
 If thou believ'st I ever can again,
 So long the wretched sport of angry Fortune,
 Admit delusive hope to my sad bosom.No----I abjure the flatterer and her train.Let those, who ne'er have been like me deceiv'd,
 Embrace the fair fantastic sycophant--
 For I, alas!am wedded to despair,
 And will not hear the sound of comfort more._Lic._ Cease, cease, my love, this tender voice of woe,
 Though softer than the dying cygnet's plaint:
 She ever chants her most melodious strain
 When death and sorrow harmonise her note._At._ Yes--I will listen now with fond delight;
 For death and sorrow are my darling themes.Well!--what hast thou to say of death and sorrow?Believe me, thou wilt find me apt to listen,
 And, if my tongue be slow to answer thee,
 Instead of words I'll give thee sighs and tears._Lic._ I come to dry thy tears, not make them flow;
 The gods once more propitious smile upon us,
 Joy shall again await each happy morn,
 And ever-new delight shall crown the day!Yes, Regulus shall live.----

 _At._                   Ah me!I'm but a poor, weak, trembling woman--
 I cannot bear these wild extremes of fate--
 Then mock me not.--I think thou art Licinius,
 The generous lover, and the faithful friend!I think thou wouldst not sport with my afflictions._Lic._ Mock thy afflictions?--May eternal Jove,
 And every power at whose dread shrine we worship,
 Blast all the hopes my fond ideas form,
 If I deceive thee!Regulus shall live,
 Shall live to give thee to Licinius' arms.we will smooth his downward path of life,
 And after a long length of virtuous years,
 At the last verge of honourable age,
 When nature's glimmering lamp goes gently out,
 We'll close, together close his eyes in peace--
 Together drop the sweetly-painful tear--
 Then copy out his virtues in our lives._At._ And shall we be so blest?Forgive me, my Licinius, if I doubt thee.Fate never gave such exquisite delight
 As flattering hope hath imag'd to thy soul.But how?----Explain this bounty of the gods._Lic._ Thou know'st what influence the name of Tribune
 Gives its possessor o'er the people's minds:
 That power I have exerted, nor in vain;
 All are prepar'd to second my designs:
 The plot is ripe,--there's not a man but swears
 To keep thy god-like father here in Rome----
 To save his life at hazard of his own._At._ By what gradation does my joy ascend!I thought that if my father had been sav'd
 By any means, I had been rich in bliss:
 But that he lives, and lives preserv'd by thee,
 Is such a prodigality of fate,
 I cannot bear my joy with moderation:
 Heav'n should have dealt it with a scantier hand,
 And not have shower'd such plenteous blessings on me;
 They are too great, too flattering to be real;
 'Tis some delightful vision, which enchants,
 And cheats my senses, weaken'd by misfortune._Lic._ We'll seek thy father, and meanwhile, my fair,
 Compose thy sweet emotions ere thou see'st him,
 Pleasure itself is painful in excess;
 For joys, like sorrows, in extreme, oppress:
 The gods themselves our pious cares approve,
 And to reward our virtue crown our love._An Apartment in the Ambassador's Palace--Guards
 and other Attendants seen at a distance._


 _Ham._ Where is this wondrous man, this matchless hero,
 This arbiter of kingdoms and of kings,
 This delegate of heav'n, this Roman god?I long to show his soaring mind an equal,
 And bring it to the standard of humanity.What pride, what glory will it be to fix
 An obligation on his stubborn soul!The very thought exalts me e'en to rapture._Enter_ REGULUS _and Guards_._Ham._ Well, Regulus!--At last--

 _Reg._                            I know it all;
 I know the motive of thy just complaint--
 Be not alarm'd at this licentious uproar
 Of the mad populace.I will depart--
 Fear not--I will not stay in Rome alive._Ham._ What dost thou mean by uproar and alarms?Hamilcar does not come to vent complaints;
 He rather comes to prove that Afric, too,
 Produces heroes, and that Tiber's banks
 May find a rival on the Punic coast._Reg._ Be it so.--'Tis not a time for vain debate:
 Collect thy people.--Let us strait depart._Ham._ Lend me thy hearing, first._Reg._                       O patience, patience!_Ham._ Is it esteem'd a glory to be grateful?_Reg._ The time has been when 'twas a duty only,
 But 'tis a duty now so little practis'd,
 That to perform it is become a glory._Ham._ If to fulfil it should expose to danger?----

 _Reg._ It rises then to an illustrious virtue._Ham._ Then grant this merit to an African.Give me a patient hearing----Thy great son,
 As delicate in honour as in love,
 Hath nobly given my Barce to my arms;
 And yet I know he doats upon the maid.I come to emulate the generous deed;
 He gave me back my love, and in return
 I will restore his father._Reg._                   Ah!_Ham._                       I will._Reg._                                But how?_Ham._ By leaving thee at liberty to _fly_._Reg._                                      Ah!_Ham._ I will dismiss my guards on some pretence,
 Meanwhile do thou escape, and lie conceal'd:
 I will affect a rage I shall not feel,
 Unmoor my ships, and sail for Africa._Reg._ Abhorr'd barbarian!_Ham._                   Well, what dost thou say?_Reg._                       I am, indeed._Ham._ Thou could'st not then have hop'd it?_Reg._                          No!_Ham._ And yet I'm not a Roman._Reg._ (_smiling contemptuously._) I perceive it._Ham._ You may retire (_aloud to the guards_)._Reg._             No!--Stay, I charge you stay._Reg._                  I thank thee for thy offer,
 But I shall go with thee._Ham._                   'Tis well, proud man!_Reg._                        No--but I pity thee._Reg._                   Because thy poor dark soul
 Hath never felt the piercing ray of virtue.the scheme thou dost propose
 Would injure me, thy country, and thyself._Reg._                   Who was it gave thee power
 To rule the destiny of Regulus?Am I a slave to Carthage, or to thee?_Ham._ What does it signify from whom, proud Roman!_Reg._                           A benefit?is it a benefit
 To lie, elope, deceive, and be a villain?not when life itself, when all's at stake?Know'st thou my countrymen prepare thee tortures
 That shock imagination but to think of?Thou wilt be mangled, butcher'd, rack'd, impal'd._Reg._ (_smiling at his threats._) Hamilcar!Dost thou not know the Roman genius better?We live on honour--'tis our food, our life.The motive, and the measure of our deeds!We look on death as on a common object;
 The tongue nor faulters, nor the cheek turns pale,
 Nor the calm eye is mov'd at sight of him:
 We court, and we embrace him undismay'd;
 We smile at tortures if they lead to glory,
 And only cowardice and guilt appal us.the valour of the tongue,
 The heart disclaims it; leave this pomp of words,
 And cease dissembling with a friend like me.I know that life is dear to all who live,
 That death is dreadful,--yes, and must be fear'd,
 E'en by the frozen apathists of Rome._Reg._ Did I fear death when on Bagrada's banks
 I fac'd and slew the formidable serpent
 That made your boldest Africans recoil,
 And shrink with horror, though the monster liv'd
 A native inmate of their own parch'd deserts?Did I fear death before the gates of Adis?--
 Ask Bostar, or let Asdrubal confess._Ham._ Or shall I rather of Xantippus ask,
 Who dar'd to undeceive deluded Rome,
 And prove this vaunter not invincible?'Tis even said, in Africa I mean,
 He made a prisoner of this demigod.--
 Did we not triumph then?_Reg._                     Vain boaster!No Carthaginian conquer'd Regulus;
 Xantippus was a Greek--a brave one too:
 Yet what distinction did your Afric make
 Between the man who serv'd her, and her foe:
 I was the object of her open hate;
 He, of her secret, dark malignity.He durst not trust the nation he had sav'd;
 He knew, and therefore fear'd you.--Yes, he knew
 Where once you were oblig'd you ne'er forgave.Could you forgive at all, you'd rather pardon
 The man who hated, than the man who serv'd you.Xantippus found his ruin ere it reach'd him,
 Lurking behind your honours and rewards;
 Found it in your feign'd courtesies and fawnings.When vice intends to strike a master stroke,
 Its veil is smiles, its language protestations.The Spartan's merit threaten'd, but his service
 Compell'd his ruin.--Both you could not pardon._Ham._ Come, come, I know full well----

 _Reg._                          Barbarian!I've heard too much.--Go, call thy followers:
 Prepare thy ships, and learn to do thy duty._Ham._ Yes!--show thyself intrepid, and insult me;
 Call mine the blindness of barbarian friendship.On Tiber's banks I hear thee, and am calm:
 But know, thou scornful Roman!that too soon
 In Carthage thou may'st fear and feel my vengeance:
 Thy cold, obdurate pride shall there confess,
 Though Rome may talk--'tis Africa can punish.[_Exit._

 _Reg._ Farewell!I've not a thought to waste on thee.I fear--but see Attilia comes!--

    _Enter_ ATTILIA._Reg._ What brings thee here, my child?_At._              I cannot speak--my father!Joy chokes my utterance--Rome, dear grateful Rome,
 (Oh, may her cup with blessings overflow!)Gives up our common destiny to thee;
 Faithful and constant to th' advice thou gav'st her,
 She will not hear of peace, or change of slaves,
 But she insists--reward and bless her, gods!--
 That thou shalt here remain._Reg._                   What!with the shame----

 _At._ Oh!no--the sacred senate hath consider'd
 That when to Carthage thou did'st pledge thy faith,
 Thou wast a captive, and that being such,
 Thou could'st not bind thyself in covenant._Reg._ He who can die, is always free, my child!Learn farther, he who owns another's strength
 Confesses his own weakness.--Let them know,
 I swore I would return because I chose it,
 And will return, because I swore to do it._Pub._ Vain is that hope, my father._Reg._                          Who shall stop me?_Pub._ All Rome.----The citizens are up in arms:
 In vain would reason stop the growing torrent;
 In vain wouldst thou attempt to reach the port,
 The way is barr'd by thronging multitudes:
 The other streets of Rome are all deserted._Reg._ Where, where is Manlius?_Pub._                       He is still thy friend:
 His single voice opposes a whole people;
 He threats this moment and the next entreats,
 But all in vain; none hear him, none obey.The general fury rises e'en to madness.The axes tremble in the lictors' hands,
 Who, pale and spiritless, want power to use them--
 And one wild scene of anarchy prevails.I tremble----
                              [_Detaining_ REGULUS._Reg._                        To assist my friend--
 T' upbraid my hapless country with her crime--
 To keep unstain'd the glory of these chains--
 To go, or perish._At._               Oh!_Reg._                                 Hold;
 I have been patient with thee; have indulg'd
 Too much the fond affections of thy soul;
 It is enough; thy grief would now offend
 Thy father's honour; do not let thy tears
 Conspire with Rome to rob me of my triumph._Reg._                             I know it does.I know 'twill grieve thy gentle heart to lose me;
 But think, thou mak'st the sacrifice to Rome,
 And all is well again._At._                   Alas!my father,
 In aught beside----

 _Reg._ What wouldst thou do, my child?Canst thou direct the destiny of Rome,
 And boldly plead amid the assembled senate?Canst thou, forgetting all thy sex's softness,
 Fiercely engage in hardy deeds of arms?Canst thou encounter labour, toil and famine,
 Fatigue and hardships, watchings, cold and heat?Canst thou attempt to serve thy country thus?Thou canst not:--but thou may'st sustain my loss
 Without these agonising pains of grief,
 And set a bright example of submission,
 Worthy a Roman's daughter._At._                         Yet such fortitude--

 _Reg._ Is a most painful virtue;--but Attilia
 Is Regulus's daughter, and must have it._At._ I will entreat the gods to give it me._Reg._ Is this concern a mark that thou hast lost it?I cannot, cannot spurn my weeping child.Receive this proof of my paternal fondness;--
 Thou lov'st Licinius--he too loves my daughter.I give thee to his wishes; I do more--
 I give thee to his virtues.--Yes, Attilia,
 The noble youth deserves this dearest pledge
 Thy father's friendship ever can bestow.wilt thou, canst thou leave me?_Reg._ I am, I am thy father!as a proof,
 I leave thee my example how to suffer.I have a heart within this bosom;
 That heart has passions--see in what we differ;
 Passion--which is thy tyrant--is my slave.Ah!--

 _Reg._                       Farewell![_Exit._

 _At._ Yes, Regulus!I feel thy spirit here,
 Thy mighty spirit struggling in this breast,
 And it shall conquer all these coward feelings,
 It shall subdue the woman in my soul;
 A Roman virgin should be something more--
 Should dare above her sex's narrow limits--
 And I will dare--and mis'ry shall assist me--
 My father!The hero shall no more disdain his child;
 Attilia shall not be the only branch
 That yields dishonour to the parent tree.is it true that Regulus,
 In spite of senate, people, augurs, friends,
 And children, will depart?_At._                       Yes, it is true._At._                                You forget--
 Barce!_Barce._ Dost thou approve a virtue which must lead
 To chains, to tortures, and to certain death?those chains, those tortures, and that death,
 Will be his triumph._Barce._                Thou art pleas'd, Attilia:
 By heav'n thou dost exult in his destruction![_Weeps._

 _Barce._                   I do not comprehend thee._At._ No, Barce, I believe it.--Why, how shouldst thou?If I mistake not, thou wast born in Carthage,
 In a barbarian land, where never child
 Was taught to triumph in a father's chains._Barce._ Yet thou dost weep--thy tears at least are honest,
 For they refuse to share thy tongue's deceit;
 They speak the genuine language of affliction,
 And tell the sorrows that oppress thy soul._At._ Grief, that dissolves in tears, relieves the heart.When congregated vapours melt in rain,
 The sky is calm'd, and all's serene again.[_Exit._

 _Barce._ Why, what a strange, fantastic land is this!This love of glory's the disease of Rome;
 It makes her mad, it is a wild delirium,
 An universal and contagious frenzy;
 It preys on all, it spares nor sex nor age:
 The Consul envies Regulus his chains--
 He, not less mad, contemns his life and freedom--
 The daughter glories in the father's ruin--
 And Publius, more distracted than the rest,
 Resigns the object that his soul adores,
 For this vain phantom, for this empty glory.This may be virtue; but I thank the gods,
 The soul of Barce's not a Roman soul.[_Exit._

Hyphenation is inconsistent.In view of the Roman context, the word "virtus" was left in place in
a speech by Manlius in Act III, although it may be a misprint for
"virtue".Even then, he asked
permission to take it to his chamber.The doctor had fallen asleep under the roof of the inquisitor's convent,
confident, under God, in the protection at that time guaranteed to
a British subject, his servants sleeping in the gallery outside
the chamber-door.About midnight, he was waked by loud shrieks and
expressions of terror from some one in the gallery.In the first moment
of surprise, he concluded it must be the alguazils of the holy office
seizing his servants to carry them to the Inquisition.But, on going
out, he saw the servants standing at the door, and the person who
had caused the alarm, a boy of about fourteen, at a little distance,
surrounded by some of the priests, who had come out of their cells on
hearing the noise.The boy said he had seen a spectre; and it was a
considerable time before the agitations of his body and voice
subsided.Next morning at breakfast, the inquisitor apologized for
the disturbance, and said the boy's alarm proceeded from a phantasma
animi,--phantom of the imagination.Phantoms might well haunt such a place.As to
Dellon's book, the inquisitor acknowledged that the descriptions
were just; but complained that he had misjudged the motives of the
inquisitors, and written uncharitably of Holy Church.Their conversation
grew earnest, and the inquisitor was anxious to impress his visitor with
the idea that the Inquisition had undergone a change in some respects,
and that its terrors were mitigated.Buchanan plainly
requested to see the Inquisition, that he might judge for himself as to
the humanity shown to the inmates,--according to the inquisitor,--and
gave, as a reason why he should be satisfied, his interest in the
affairs of India, on which he had written, and his purpose to write on
them again, in which case he could scarcely be silent concerning the
Inquisition.The countenance of his host fell; but, after some further
observations, he reluctantly promised to comply.Next morning, after
breakfast, Joseph a Doloribus went to dress for the holy office, and
soon returned in his black robes.He said he would go half an hour
before the usual time, for the purpose of showing him the Inquisition.The doctor fancied he looked more severe than usual, and that his
attendants were not as civil as before.But the truth was, that the
midnight scene still haunted him.They had proceeded in their palanquins
to the holy house, distant about a quarter of a mile from the convent,
and the inquisitor said as they were ascending the steps of the great
entrance, that he hoped the doctor would be satisfied with a transient
view of the Inquisition, and would retire when he should desire him to
do so.The doctor followed with tolerable confidence, towards the
great hall aforementioned, where they were met by several well-dressed
persons, familiars, as it afterwards appeared, who bowed very low to the
inquisitor, and looked with surprise at the stranger.Buchanan paced
the hall slowly, and in thoughtful silence; the inquisitor thoughtful
too, silent and embarrassed.A multitude of victims seemed to haunt the
place, and the doctor could not refrain from breaking silence."Would
not the Holy Church wish, in her mercy, to have those souls back again,
that she might allow them a little further probation?"The inquisitor
answered nothing, but beckoned him to go with him to a door at one end
of the hall.By that door he conducted him to some small rooms, and
thence, to the spacious apartments of the chief inquisitor.Having
surveyed those, he brought him back again to the great hall, and seemed
anxious that the troublesome visitor should depart; but only the very
words of Dr.B. can adequately describe the close of this extraordinary
interview.""Now, father," said I, "lead me to the dungeons below: I want to see the
captives.""No," said he, "that cannot be."I now began to suspect that
it had been in the mind of the inquisitor, from the beginning, to show
me only a certain part of the Inquisition, in the hope of satisfying
my inquiries in a general way.I urged him with earnestness; but he
steadily resisted, and seemed offended, or, rather, agitated, by my
importunity.I intimated to him plainly, that the only way to do justice
to his own assertion and arguments regarding the present state of the
Inquisition, was to show me the prisons and the captives.I should
then describe only what I saw; but now the subject was left in awful
obscurity."Lead me down," said I, "to the inner building, and let me
pass through the two hundred dungeons, ten feet square, described by
your former captives.Let me count the number of your present captives,
and converse with them.I WANT, TO SEE IF THERE BE ANY SUBJECTS OF THE
BRITISH GOVERNMENT, TO WHOM WE OWE PROTECTION.I want to ask how long
they have been there, how long it is since they have seen the light
of the sun, and whether they ever expect to see it again.Show me the
chamber of torture, and declare what modes of execution or punishment
are now practiced inside the walls of the Inquisition, in lieu of the
public Auto de Fe.If, after all that has passed, father, you resist
this reasonable request, I should be justified in believing that you are
afraid of exposing the real state of the Inquisition in India."To these observations the inquisitor made no reply; but seemed impatient
that I should withdraw."My good father," said I; "I am about to take
my leave of you, and to thank you for your hospitable attentions; and I
wish to preserve on my mind a favorable sentiment of your kindness and
candor.You cannot, you say, show me the captives and the dungeons; be
pleased, then, merely to answer this question, for I shall believe
your word: how many prisoners are there now below in the cells of the
Inquisition?"He replied, "That is a question which I cannot answer."On his pronouncing these words, I retired hastily towards the door, and
wished him farewell.We shook hands with as much cordiality as we could,
at the moment, assume; and both of us, I believe, were sorry that our
parting took place with a clouded countenance.Buchanan, feeling as if he could
not refrain from endeavoring to get another and perhaps a nearer view,
returned to avail himself of the pretext afforded by a promise from
the chief inquisitor, of a letter to one of the British residents at
Travancore, in answer to one which he had brought him from that officer.The inquisitors he expected to find within, in the "board of the holy
office."The door-keepers surveyed him doubtfully, but allowed him to
pass.He entered the great hall, went up directly to the lofty crucifix
described by Dellon, sat down on a form, wrote some notes, and then
desired an attendant to carry in his name to the inquisitor.As he was
walking across the hall, he saw a poor woman sitting by the wall.She
clasped her hands, and looked at him imploringly.The sight chilled
his spirits; and as he was asking the attendants the cause of her
apprehension,--for she was awaiting trial,--Joseph a Doloribus came, in
answer to his message, and was about to complain of the intrusion,
when he parried the complaint by asking for the letter from the chief
inquisitor.He promised to send it after him, and conducted him to the
door.As they passed the poor woman, the doctor pointed to her, and said
with emphasis, "Behold, father, another victim of the Holy Inquisition."The other answered nothing; they bowed, and separated without a word.Buchanan published his "Christian Researches in Asia," in the
year 1812, the Inquisition still existed at Goa; but the establishment
of constitutional government in Portugal, put an end to it throughout
the whole Portuguese dominions.APPENDIX V.

INQUISITION AT MACERATA, ITALY.I never pretended that it was for the sake of religion alone, that I
left Italy, On the contrary, I have often declared, that, had I never
belonged to the Inquisition, I should have gone on, as most Roman
Catholics do, without ever questioning the truth of the religion I was
brought up in, or thinking of any other.But the unheard of cruelties
of that hellish tribunal shocked me beyond all expression, and rendered
me,--as I was obliged, by my office of Counsellor, to be accessary to
them,--one of the most unhappy men upon earth.I therefore began
to think of resigning my office; but as I had on several occasions,
betrayed some weakness as they termed it, that is, some compassion and
humanity, and had upon that account been reprimanded by the Inquisitor,
I was well apprized that my resignation would be ascribed by him to
my disapproving the proceedings of the holy tribunal.And indeed, to
nothing else could it be ascribed, as a place at that board was a
sure way to preferment, and attended with great privileges, and a
considerable salary.Being, therefore, sensible how dangerous a thing it
would be to give the least ground for any suspicions of that nature,
and no longer able to bear the sight of the many barbarities practised
almost daily within those walls, nor the reproaches of my conscience for
being accessary to them, I determined, after many restless nights, and
much deliberation, to withdraw at the same time from the Inquisition,
and from Italy.In this mind, and in the most unhappy and tormenting
situation that can possibly be imagined, I continued near a
twelve-month, not able to prevail on myself to execute the resolution
I had taken on account of the many dangers which I foresaw would
inevitably attend it, and the dreadful consequences of my failing in
the attempt.But, being in the mean time ordered by the Inquisitor, to
apprehend a person with whom I had lived in the greatest intimacy and
friendship, the part I was obliged to act on that occasion, left so deep
an impression on my mind as soon prevailed over all my fears, and made
me determine to put into execution, at all events, and without delay,
the design I had formed.Of that transaction I shall give a particular
account, as it will show in a very strong light the nature and
proceedings of that horrid court.The person whom the Inquisitor appointed me to apprehend was Count
Vicenzo della Torre, descended from an illustrious family in Germany,
and possessed of a very considerable estate in the territory of
Macerata.He was one of my very particular friends, and had lately
married the daughter of Signior Constantini, of Fermo, a lady no less
famous for her good sense than her beauty.With her family too, I had
contracted an intimate acquaintance, while Professor of Rhetoric in
Fermo, and had often attended the Count during his courtship, from
Macerata to Fermo, but fifteen miles distant.I therefore lived with
both in the greatest friendship and intimacy; and the Count was the
only person that lived with me, after I was made Counsellor of the
Inquisition, upon the same free footing as he had done till that time.My other friends had grown shy of me, and gave me plainly to understand
that they no longer cared for my company.As this unhappy young gentleman was one day walking with another, he met
two Capuchin friars, and turning to his companion, when they had passed,
"what fools," said he, "are these, to think they shall gain heaven by
wearing sackcloth and going barefoot!Fools indeed, if they think so,
or that there is any merit in tormenting one's self; they might as well
live as we do, and they would get to heaven quite as soon."Who informed
against him, whether the friars, his companion, or somebody else, I
know not; for the inquisitors never tell the names of informers to the
Counsellors, nor the names of the witnesses, lest they should except
against them.It is to be observed, that all who hear any proposition
that appears to them repugnant to, or inconsistent with the doctrines of
holy mother church, are bound to reveal it to the Inquisitor, and also
to discover the person by whom it was uttered; and, in this affair no
regard is to be had to any ties, however sacred.The brother being bound
to accuse the brother, the father the son, the son the father, the wife
her husband, and the husband his wife; and all bound on pain of eternal
damnation, and of being treated as accomplices if they do not denounce
in a certain time; and no confessor can absolve a person who has heard
anything said in jest or in earnest, against the belief or practice
of the church, till that person has informed the Inquisitor of it, and
given him all the intelligence he can concerning the person by whom it
was spoken.Whoever it was that informed against my unhappy friend, whether the
friars, his companion, or somebody else who might have overheard him,
the Inquisitor acquainted the board one night, (for to be less observed,
they commonly meet, out of Rome, in the night) that the above mentioned
propositions had been advanced, and advanced gravely, at the sight of
two poor Capuchins; that the evidence was unexceptionable; and that
they were therefore met to determine the quality of the proposition, and
proceed against the delinquent.There are in each Inquisition twelve Counsellors, viz: four Divines,
four Canonists, and four Civilians.It is chiefly the province of the
divines to determine the quality of the proposition, whether it is
heretical, or only savors of heresy; whether it is blasphemous and
injurious to God and His saints or only erroneous, rash, schismatical,
or offensive to pious ears.The part of the proposition, "Fools!if
they think there is any merit in tormenting one's self," was judged and
declared heretical, as openly contradicting the doctrine and practice of
holy mother church recommending austerities as highly meritorious.The
Inquisitor observed, on this occasion, that by the proposition, "Fools
indeed" &c., were taxing with folly, not only the holy fathers, who had
all to a man practised great austerities, but St.Paul himself as the
Inquisitor understood it, adding that the practice of whipping one's
self, so much recommended by all the founders of religious orders, was
borrowed of the great apostle of the gentiles.The proposition being declared heretical, it was unanimously agreed by
the board that the person who had uttered it should be apprehended, and
proceeded against agreeably to the laws of the Inquisition.And now the
person was named; for, till it is determined whether the accused person
should or should not be apprehended, his name is kept concealed from
the counsellors, lest they should be biased, says the directory, in
his favor, or against him.For, in many instances, they keep up an
appearance of justice and equity, at the same time that, in truth, they
act in direct opposition to all the known laws of justice and equity.No words can express the concern and astonishment it gave me to hear,
on such an occasion, the name of a friend for whom I had the greatest
esteem and regard.The Inquisitor was apprised of it; and to give me an
opportunity of practising what he had so often recommended to me, viz.conquering nature with the assistance of grace, he appointed me to
apprehend the criminal, as he styled him, and to lodge him safe, before
daylight, in the prison of the holy inquisition.I offered to excuse
myself, but with the greatest submission, from being in any way
concerned in the execution of that order; an order, I said, which I
entirely approved of, but only wished it might be put in execution by
some other person; for your lordship knows, I said, the connection.But
the Inquisitor shocked at the word, said with a stern look and angry
tone of voice, "What!There is your guard," (pointing to the Sbirri or bailiffs in waiting)
"let the criminal be secured in St.Luke's cell," (one of the worst,)
"before three in the morning."He then withdrew, and as he passed me
said, "Thus, nature is conquered."I had betrayed some weakness or sense
of humanity, not long before, in fainting away while I attended the
torture of one who was racked with the utmost barbarity, and I had on
that occasion been reprimanded by the Inquisitor for suffering nature
to get the better of grace; it being an inexcusable weakness, as he
observed, to be in any degree affected with the suffering of the body,
however great, when afflicted, as they ever are in the Holy Inquisition,
for the good of the soul.And it was, I presume, to make trial of the
effect of that reprimand, that the execution of this cruel order was
committed to me.As I could by no possible means decline it, I summoned
all my resolution, after passing an hour by myself, I may say in the
agonies of death, and set out a little after two in the morning for my
unhappy friend's house, attended by a notary of the Inquisition, and six
armed Sbirri.We arrived at the house by different ways and knocking
at the door, a maid-servant looked out of the window, and asked who
knocked."The Holy Inquisition," was the answer, and at the same time
she was ordered to awake nobody, but to come down directly and open the
door, on pain of excommunication.At these words, the servant hastened
down, half naked as she was, and having with much ado, in her great
fright, opened the door, she conducted us as she was ordered to her
master's chamber.She often looked very earnestly at me, as she knew me,
and showed a great desire to speak with me; but of her I durst take no
kind of notice.I entered the bed-chamber with the notary, followed by
the Sbirri, when the lady awakening at the noise, and seeing the bed
surrounded by armed men, screamed out aloud and continued screaming as
out of her senses, till one of the Sbirri, provoked at the noise gave
her a blow on the forehead that made the blood flow, and she swooned
away.I rebuked the fellow severely, and ordered him to be whipped as
soon as I returned to the Inquisition.In the mean time, the husband awakening, and seeing me with my
attendants, cried out, in the utmost surprise, "MR.He said no
more, nor could I for some time utter a single word; and it was with
much ado that, in the end I so far mastered my grief as to be able
to let my unfortunate friend know that he was a prisoner of the Holy
Inquisition."Alas I what have I
done?He said many affecting things;
but as I knew it was not in my power to befriend him, I had not the
courage to look him in the face, but turning my back to him, withdrew,
while he dressed, to a corner of the room, to give vent to my grief.The
notary stood by, quite unaffected.Indeed, to be void of all humanity,
to be able to behold one's fellow-creatures groaning under the most
exquisite torments cruelty can invent, without being in the least
affected with their sufferings, is one of the chief qualifications of
an inquisitor, and what all who belong to the Inquisition must strive to
attain to.It often happens, at that infernal tribunal, that while the
unhappy, and probably innocent, person is crying out in their presence
on the rack, and begging by all that is sacred for one moment's relief,
in a manner one would think no human heart could withstand, it often
happens, I say, that the inquisitor and the rest of his infamous crew,
quite unaffected with his complaints, and deaf to his groans, to his
tears and entreaties, are entertaining one another with the news of the
town; nay, sometimes they even insult, with unheard of barbarity, the
unhappy wretches in the height of their torment.He was no sooner dressed than I
ordered the Bargello, or head of the Sbirri, to tie his hands with
a cord behind his back, as is practised on such occasions without
distinction of persons; no more regard being paid to men of the first
rank, when charged with heresy, than to the meanest offender.Heresy
dissolves all friendship; so that I durst no longer look upon the man
with whom I had lived in the greatest friendship and intimacy as my
friend, or show him, on that account, the least regard or indulgence.As we left the chamber, the countess, who had been conveyed out of the
room, met us, and screaming out in the most pitiful manner upon seeing
her husband with his hands tied behind his back like a thief or robber,
flew to embrace him, and hanging on his neck, begged, with a flood of
tears, we would be so merciful as to put an end to her life, that she
might have the satisfaction--the only satisfaction she wished for in
this world, of dying in the bosom of the man from whom she had vowed
never to part.The count, overwhelmed with grief, did not utter a single
word.I could not find it in my heart, nor was I in a condition to
interpose; and indeed a scene of greater distress was never beheld by
human eyes.However, I gave a signal to the notary to part them, which
he did accordingly, quite unconcerned; but the countess fell into a
swoon, and the count was meantime carried down stairs, and out of the
house, amid the loud lamentations and sighs of his servants, on all
sides, for he was a man remarkable for the sweetness of his temper, and
his kindness to all around him.Being arrived at the Inquisition, I consigned my prisoner into the
hands of a gaoler, a lay brother of St.Dominic, who shut him up in the
dungeon above-mentioned, and delivered the key to me.I lay that night
at the palace of the Inquisition, where every counsellor has a room, and
returned next morning the key to the inquisitor, telling him that his
order had been punctually complied with.The inquisitor had been already
informed of my conduct by the notary, and therefore, upon my delivering
the key to him, he said, "You have acted like one who is at least
desirous to overcome, with the assistance of grace, the inclinations of
nature;" that is, like one who is desirous, by the assistance of grace,
to metamorphose himself from a human creature into a brute or a devil.In the Inquisition, every prisoner is kept the first week of his
imprisonment in a dark narrow dungeon, so low that he cannot stand
upright in it, without seeing anybody but the gaoler, who brings him,
EVERY OTHER DAY, his portion of bread and water, the only food allowed
him.This is done, they say, to tame him, and render him, thus weakened,
more sensible of the torture, and less able to endure it.At the end of
the week, he is brought in the night before the board to be examined;
and on that occasion my poor friend appeared so altered, in a week's
time, that, had it not been for his dress, I should not have known him.And indeed no wonder; a change of condition so sudden and unexpected;
the unworthy and barbarous treatment he had already met with; the
apprehension of what he might and probably should suffer; and perhaps,
more than anything else, the distressed and forlorn condition of his
once happy wife, whom he tenderly loved, whose company he had enjoyed
only six months, could be attended with no other effect.Being asked, according to custom, whether he had any enemies, and
desired to name them, he answered, that he bore enmity to no man, and he
hoped no man bore enmity to him.For, as in the Inquisition the person
accused is not told of the charge brought against him, nor of the person
by whom it is brought, the inquisitor asks him if he has any enemies,
and desires him to name them.If he names the informer, all further
proceedings are stopped until the informer is examined anew; and if the
information is found to proceed from ill-will and no collateral proof
can be produced, the prisoner is discharged.Of this piece of justice
they frequently boast, at the same time that they admit, both as
informers and witnesses, persons of the most infamous characters,
and such as are excluded by all other courts.In the next place, the
prisoner is ordered to swear that he will declare the truth, and conceal
nothing from the holy tribunal, concerning himself or others, that he
knows and the holy tribunal desires to know.He is then interrogated for
what crime he has been apprehended and imprisoned by the Holy Court of
the Inquisition, of all courts the most equitable, the most cautious,
the most merciful.To that interrogatory the count answered, with a
faint and trembling voice, that he was not conscious to himself of any
crime, cognizable by the Holy Court, nor indeed by any other; that he
believed and ever had believed whatever holy mother church believed or
required him to believe.He had, it seems quite forgotten what he
had unthinkingly said at the sight of the two friars.The inquisitor,
therefore, finding that he did not remember or would not own his crime,
after many deceitful interrogatories, and promises which he never
intended to fulfil, ordered him back to his dungeon, and allowing him
another week, as is customary in such cases, to recollect himself, told
him that if he could not in that time prevail upon himself to declare
the truth, agreeably to his oath, means would be found of forcing it
from him; and he must expect no mercy.At the end of the week he was brought again before the infernal
tribunal; and being asked the same questions, returned the same answers,
adding, that if he had done or said anything amiss, unwittingly or
ignorantly, he was ready to own it, provided the least hint of it were
given him by any there present, which he entreated them most earnestly
to do.He often looked at me, and seemed to expect--which gave me such
concern as no words can express--that I should say something in his
favor.But I was not allowed to speak on this occasion, nor were any of
the counsellors; and had I been allowed to speak, I durst not have said
anything in his favor; the advocate appointed by the Inquisition, and
commonly styled, "The Devil's Advocate," being the only person that
is suffered to speak for the prisoner.The advocate belongs to the
Inquisition, receives a salary from the Inquisition, and is bound by an
oath to abandon the defence of the prisoner, if he undertakes it, or not
to undertake it, if he finds it cannot be defended agreeably to the laws
of the Holy Inquisition; go that the whole is mere sham and imposition.I have heard this advocate, on other occasions, allege something in
favor of the person accused; but on this occasion he declared that he
had nothing to offer in defence of the criminal.In the Inquisition, the person accused is always supposed guilty, unless
he has named the accuser among his enemies.And he is put to the torture
if he does not plead guilty, and own the crime that is laid to his
charge, without being so much as told what it is; whereas, in all other
courts, where tortures are used, the charge is declared to the party
accused before he is tortured; nor are they ever inflicted without
a credible evidence of his guilt.But in the Inquisition, a man is
frequently tortured upon the deposition of a person whose evidence would
be admitted in no other court, and in all cases without hearing the
charge.As my unfortunate friend continued to maintain his innocence,
not recollecting what he had said, he was, agreeably to the laws of
the Inquisition, put to the torture.He had scarcely borne it twenty
minutes, crying out the whole time, "Jesus Maria!"when his voice failed
him at once, and he fainted away.He was then supported, as he hung
by his arms, by two of the Sbirri, whose province it is to manage the
torture, till he returned to himself.He still continued to declare that
he could not recollect his having said or done anything contrary to the
Catholic faith, and earnestly begged they would let him know with what
he was charged, being ready to own it if it was true.The Inquisitor was then so gracious as to put him in mind of what he had
said on seeing the two Capuchins.The reason why they so long conceal
from the party accused the crime he is charged with, is, that if he
should be conscious to himself of his having ever said or done anything
contrary to the faith, which he is not charged with, he may discover
that too, imagining it to be the very crime he is accused of.After a
short pause, the poor gentleman owned that he had said something to that
purpose; but, as he had said it with no evil intention, he had never
more thought of it, from that time to the present.He added, but with a
voice so faint, as scarce could be heard, that for his rashness he was
willing to undergo what punishment soever the holy tribunal should,
think fit to impose on him; and he again fainted away.Being eased for
a while of his torment, and returned to himself, he was interrogated by
the promoter fiscal (whose business it is to accuse and to prosecute, as
neither the informer nor the witnesses, are ever to appear,) concerning
his intention.For in the Inquisition, it is not enough for the party
accused to confess the fact, he must declare whether his intention was
heretical or not; and many, to redeem themselves from the torments
they, can no longer endure, own their intention was heretical, though
it really was not.My poor friend often told us, he was ready to say
whatever he pleased, but as he never directly acknowledged his intention
to have been heretical, as is required by the rules of the court, he
was kept on the torture still, quite overcome with the violence of the
anguish, he was ready to expire.Being taken down, he was carried quite
senseless, back to his dungeon, and there, on the third day, death put
an end to his sufferings.The Inquisitor wrote a note to his widow, to
desire her to pray for the soul of her late husband, and warn her not
to complain of the holy Inquisition, as capable of any injustice or
cruelty.The estate was confiscated to the Inquisition, and a small
jointure allowed out of it to the widow.As they had only been
married six months, and some part of the fortune was not yet paid, the
inquisitor sent an order to the Constantini family, at Ferno, to pay the
holy office, and without delay, what they owed to the late Count Della
Torre.The effects of heretics are all ipso facto confiscated to the
Inquisition from the very day, not of their conviction, but of their
crime, so that all donations made after that time are void; and whatever
they may have given, is claimed by the Inquisition, into whatsoever
hands it may have passed; even the fortunes they have given to their
daughters in marriage, have been declared to belong to, and are claimed
by the Inquisition; nor can it be doubted, that the desire of those
confiscations is one great cause of the injustice and cruelty of that
court.The death of the unhappy Count Della Torre was soon publicly known; but
no man cared to speak of it, not even his nearest relations, nor so much
as to mention his name, lest anything should inadvertently escape them
that might be construed into a disapprobation of the proceedings of the
most holy tribunal; so great is the awe all men live in of that jealous
and merciless court.The deep impression that the death of my unhappy friend, the barbarous
and inhuman treatment he had met with, and the part I had been obliged
to act in so affecting a tragedy, made on my mind, got at once the
better of my fears, so that, forgetting in a manner the dangers I had
till then so much apprehended, I resolved, without further delay to put
in execution the design I had formed, of quitting the Inquisition, and
bidding forever adieu to Italy.To execute that design with some safety,
I proposed to beg leave to visit the Virgin of Loretto, but thirteen
miles distant, and to pass a week there; but in the mean time, to make
the best of my way out of the reach of the Inquisition.Having, therefore, after many conflicts with myself, asked leave to
visit the neighboring sanctuary, and obtained it, I set out on horseback
the very next morning, leaving, as I proposed to keep the horse, his
full value with the owner.I took the road to Loretto, but turned out
of it a short distance from Recanati, after a most violent struggle with
myself, the attempt appearing to me at that juncture, quite desperate
and impracticable; and the dreadful doom reserved for me should I
miscarry, presented itself to my mind in the strongest light.But the
reflection that I had it in my power to avoid being taken alive, and
a persuasion that a man in my situation might lawfully avoid it, when
every other means failed him, at the expense of his life, revived my
staggered resolution; and all my fears ceasing at once, I steered my
course, leaving Loretto behind me, to Rocca Contrada, to Fossonbrone, to
Calvi in the dukedom of Urbino, and from thence through the Romagna into
Bolognese, keeping the by-roads, and at a good distance from the cities
through which the high road passed.Thus I advanced very slowly, travelling in very bad roads, and often in
places where there was no road at all, to avoid, not only the cities,
and towns, but also the villages.In the mean time I seldom had any
other support but some coarse provisions, and a very small quantity
even, of them, that the poor shepherds, the countrymen or wood cleavers
I met in those unfrequented by-places, could spare me.My horse fared
not much better than myself; but, in choosing my sleeping-place I
consulted his convenience as much as my own, passing the night where I
found most shelter for myself, and most grass for him.In Italy there
are very few solitary farm-houses or cottages, the country people all
living together in villages; and I thought it far safer to lie where I
could be in any way sheltered, than to venture into any of them.Thus I
spent seventeen days before I got out of the ecclesiastical state; and
I very narrowly escaped being taken or murdered, on the very borders of
that state; it happened thus.I had passed two whole days without any kind of subsistence whatever,
meeting with no one in the by-roads that could supply me with any, and
fearing to come near any house, as I was not far from the borders of the
dominions of the Pope.I thought I should be able to hold out till I
got into the Modanese, where I believed I should be in less danger than
while I remained in the papal dominions.But finding myself, about noon
of the third day, extremely weak and ready to faint away, I came into
the high road that leads from Bologna to Florence, a few miles distant
from the former city, and alighted at a post house, that stood quite
by itself.Having asked the woman of the house whether she had any
victuals, and being told that she had, I went to open the door of the
only room in the house, (that being a place where gentlemen only stop
to change horses,) and saw to my great surprise, a placard pasted on it,
with a minute description of my whole person, sad a promise of a reward
of 900 crowns (about 200 pounds English money) for delivering me up
alive to the Inquisition, being a fugitive from that holy tribunal,
and of 600 crowns for my head.By the same placard, all persons were
forbidden, on pain of the greater excommunication, to receive or
harbor, entertain, conceal, or screen me, or to be in any way aiding, or
assisting me to make my escape.This greatly alarmed me, as the reader
may well imagine; but I was still more frightened, when entering the
room, I saw two fellows drinking there, who, fixing their eyes on me as
soon as I went in, continued looking at me very steadfastly.I strove,
by wiping my face and blowing my nose, and by looking out of the window,
to prevent their having a full view of my features.But, one of
them saying, "The gentleman seems afraid to be seen," I put up my
handkerchief, and turning to the fellow, said boldly, "What do you mean
you rascal?Look at me; am I afraid to be seen?"He said nothing, but
looking again steadfastly at me, and nodding his head, went out, and
his companion immediately followed him.I watched them, and seeing them,
with two or three more, in close conference, and no doubt consulting
whether they should apprehend me or not, I walked that moment into
the stable, mounted my horse unobserved by them, and while they were
deliberating in an orchard behind the house, rode off at full speed, and
in a few hours got into the Modanese, where I refreshed both with food
and rest, as I was there in no immediate danger, my horse and myself.I
was indeed surprised to find that those fellows did not pursue me, nor
can I in any other way account for it, but by supposing, what is not
improbable, that, as they were strangers as well as myself, and had all
the appearance of banditti or ruffians flying out of the dominions of
the Pope, the woman of the house did not care to trust them with her
horses.From the Modanese I continued my journey, more leisurely through
the Parmesan, the Milanese, and part of the Venetian territory, to
Chiavenna, subject to the Grisons, who abhor the very name of the
Inquisition, and are ever ready to receive and protect all who, flying
from it, take refuge, as many Italians do, in their dominions.Still
I carefully concealed who I was, and whence I came, for, though no
Inquisition prevails among the Swiss, yet the Pope's nuncio who resides
at Lucerne, (a popish canton through which I was to pass,) might have
persuaded the magistrate to stop me as an apostate and deserter from the
order.Having rested a few days at Chiavenna, I resumed my journey quite
refreshed, continuing it through the country of the Grisons, and the two
small cantons of Ury and Underwald, to the canton of Lucerne.There
I missed my way, as I was quite unacquainted with the country, and
discovering a city at a distance, was advancing to it, but slowly, as I
knew not where I was, when a countryman whom I met, informed me that the
city before me was Lucerne.Upon that intelligence, I turned out of the
road as soon as the countryman was out of sight, and that night I
passed with a good natured shepherd in his cottage, who supplied me with
sheep's milk, and my horse with plenty of grass.I set out early next
morning, making my way westward, as I knew that Berne lay west of
Lucerne.But, after a few miles, the country proved very mountainous,
and having travelled the whole day over mountains I was overtaken among
them by night.As I was looking out for a place where I might shelter
myself during the night, against the snow and rain, (for it both snowed
and rained,) I perceived a light at a distance, and making towards it,
I got into a kind of foot-path, but so narrow and rugged that I was
obliged to lead my horse, and feel my way with one foot, (having no
light to direct me,) before I durst move the other.Thus, with much
difficulty I reached the place where the light was, a poor little
cottage, and knocking at the door, was asked by a man within who I was,
and what I wanted?I answered that I was a stranger and had lost my way.exclaimed the man, "There is no way here to lose."I
then asked him what canton I was in?and upon his answering that I was
in the canton of Berne, I cried out transported with joy, "I thank God
that I am."The good man answered, "And so do I."I then told him who I
was, and that I was going to Berne but had quite lost myself by keeping
out of all the high roads, to avoid falling into the hands of those
who sought my destruction.He thereupon opened the door, received and
entertained me with all the hospitality his poverty would admit of;
regaled me with sour crout and some new laid eggs, the only provision
he had, and clean straw with a kind of rug for a bed, he having no other
for himself and wife.The good woman expressed as much good nature as
her husband, and said many kind things in the Swiss language, which
her husband interpreted to me in the Italian; for that language he well
understood, having learned it in his youth, while servant in a public
home on the borders of Italy, where both languages are spoken.I never
passed a more comfortable night; and no sooner did I begin to stir in
the morning, than the good man and his wife both came to know how
I rested; and, wishing they had been able to accommodate me better,
obliged me to breakfast on two eggs, which providence, they said, had
sent them for that purpose.I took leave of the wife, who seemed most
sincerely to wish me a good journey.As for the husband, he would by all
means attend me to the high road leading to Berne; which road he said
was but two miles distant from that place.But he insisted on my first
going back with him, to see the way I had come the night before; the
only way, he said, I could have possibly come from the neighboring
canton of Lucerne.I saw it, and shuddered at the danger I had escaped;
for I found I had walked and led my horse a good way along a very narrow
path on the brink of a very dangerous precipice.The man made so
many pertinent and pious remarks on the occasion, as both charmed and
surprised me.I no less admired his disinterestedness than his piety;
for, upon our parting, after he had attended me till I was out of all
danger of losing my way, I could by no means prevail upon him to accept
of any reward for his trouble.He had the satisfaction, he said, of
having relieved me in the greatest distress, which was in itself a
sufficient reward, and he wished for no other.Having at length got safe into French Flanders, I there repaired to the
college of the Scotch Jesuits at Douay, and discovering myself to the
rector, I acquainted him with the cause of my sudden departure from
Italy, and begged him to give notice of my arrival, as well as the
motives of my flight to Michael Angelo Tambuvini, general of the order,
and my very particular friend.The rector wrote as I desired him, to the general, and he, taking no
notice of my flight, in his answer, (for he could not disapprove, and
did not think it safe to approve of it,) ordered me to continue where I
was till further notice.I arrived at Douay early in May, and continued
there till the beginning of July, when the rector received a second
letter from the general, acquainting him that he had been commanded by
the congregation of the Inquisition, to order me, wherever I was, back
into Italy; to promise me, in their name, full pardon and forgiveness if
I obeyed, but if I did not obey, to treat me as an apostate.He added,
that the same order had been transmitted, soon after my flight, to
the nuncios at the different Roman Catholic courts; and he, therefore,
advised me to consult my own safety without further delay.Upon the receipt of the general's kind letter, the rector was of opinion
that I should repair by all means, and without loss of time, to England,
not only as the safest asylum I could fly to, in my present situation,
but as a place where I should soon recover my native language, and be
usefully employed, either there or in Scotland.The place being thus
agreed on, and it being at the same time settled between the rector and
me, that I should set out the very next morning, I solemnly promised, at
his request and desire, to take no kind of notice, after my arrival
in England, of his having been in any way privy to my flight, or the
general's letter to him.This promise I have faithfully and honorably
observed; and should have thought myself guilty of the blackest
ingratitude if I had not observed it, being sensible that, had it been
known at Rome, that, either the rector or general had been accessary to
my flight, THE INQUISITION WOULD HAVE RESENTED IT SEVERELY IN BOTH.For
although a Jesuit in France, in Flanders, or in Germany, is out of the
reach of the Inquisition, the general is not; and the high tribunal not
only have it in their power to punish the general himself, who resides
constantly at Rome, but may oblige him to inflict what punishment they
please on any of the order obnoxious to them.The rector went that very night out of town, and in his absence, but not
without his privity, I took one of the horses of the college, early
next morning, as if I were going for a change of air, being somewhat
indisposed, to pass a few days at Lisle; but steering a different
course, I reached Aire that night and Calais the next day.I was there
in no danger of being stopped and seized at the prosecution of the
Inquisition, a tribunal no less abhorred in France than in England.But being informed that the nuncios at the different courts had been
ordered, soon after my flight, to cause me to be apprehended in Roman
Catholic countries through which I must pass, as an apostate and
deserter from the order, I was under no small apprehension of being
discovered and apprehended as such even at Calais.No sooner, therefore,
did I alight at the Inn, than I went down to the quay, and there as I
was very little acquainted with the sea, and thought the passage much
shorter than it is, I endeavored to engage some fishermen to carry me
that very night, in one of their small vessels, over to England.This
alarmed the guards of the harbor, and I should have been certainly
apprehended as a person guilty, or suspected of some great crime,
fleeing from justice, had not Lord Baltimore, whom I had the good luck
to meet in the Inn, informed me of my danger, and pitying my condition,
attended me that moment, with all his company, to the port, and conveyed
me immediately on board his yacht.There I lay that night, leaving every
thing I had but the clothes on my back, in the Inn; and the next day his
Lordship set me ashore at Dover, from whence I came in the common stage
to London.In the year 1706, the Inquisition at Arragon was broken up by the French
troops, under the command of the Duke of Orleans.The Holy Inquisitors
were driven from their beautiful house, and in answer to their indignant
remonstrance were told that the king wanted the house to quarter his
troops in, and they were therefore compelled to leave it immediately.The doors of the prisons were then thrown open, and among the four
hundred prisoners who were set at liberty were sixty young women, very
beautiful in person, and clad in the richest attire.Anthony Gavin, formerly one of the Roman Catholic priests of Saragossa,
Spain, relates (in a book published by him after his conversion) that
when travelling in France he met one of those women in the inn at
Rotchfort; the son of the inn-keeper, formerly an officer in the French
army, having married her for her great beauty and superior intelligence.In accordance with his request, she freely related to him the incidents
of her prison life, from which we take the following extract:

"Early the next morning, Mary got up, and told me that nobody was up
yet in the house; and that she would show me the DRY PAN and the GRADUAL
FIRE, on condition that I should keep it a secret for her sake as well
as my own.This I promised, and she took me along with her, and showed
me a dark room with a thick iron door, and within it an oven and a large
brass pan upon it, with a cover of the same and a lock to it.The oven
was burning at the time, and I asked Mary for what purpose the pan was
there.Without giving me any answer, she took me by the hand and led
me to a large room, where she showed me a thick wheel, covered on both
sides with thick boards, and opening a little window in the center of
it, desired me to look with a candle on the inside of it, and I saw all
the circumference of the wheel set with SHARP RAZORS.After that she
showed me a PIT FULL OF SERPENTS AND TOADS.Then she said to me, 'Now,
my good mistress, I'll tell you the use of these things.The dry pan and
gradual fire are for those who oppose the holy father's will, and for
heretics.They are put naked and alive into the pan, and the cover of it
being locked up, the executioner begins to put in the oven a small fire,
and by degrees he augmenteth it, till the body is burned to ashes.The
second is designed for those who speak against the Pope and the holy
fathers.They are put within the wheel, and the door being locked, the
executioner turns the wheel till the person is dead.The third is for
those who contemn the images, and refuse to give the due respect and
veneration to ecclesiastical persons; for they are thrown alive into the
pit, and there they become the food of serpents and toads.'Then Mary
said to me that another day she would show me the torments for public
sinners and transgressors of the commandments of holy mother church;
but I, in deep amazement, desired her to show me no more places; for the
very thought of those three which I had seen, was enough to terrify me
to the heart.So we went to my room, and she charged me again to be very
obedient to all commands, for if I was not, I was sure to undergo the
torment of the dry pan."Llorente, the Spanish historian and secretary-general of the
Inquisition, relates the following incident: "A physician, Juan de
Salas, was accused of having used a profane expression, twelve months
before, in the heat of debate.He denied the accusation, and produced
several witnesses to prove his innocence.But Moriz, the inquisitor at
Valladolid, where the charge was laid, caused de Salas to be brought
into his presence in the torture-chamber, stripped to his shirt, and
laid on a LADDER or DONKEY, an instrument resembling a wooden trough,
just large enough to receive the body, with no bottom, but having a
bar or bars to placed that the body bent, by its own weight, into an
exquisitely painful position.His head was lower than his heels, and the
breathing, in consequence, became exceedingly difficult.The poor man,
so laid, was bound around the arms and legs with hempen cords, each of
them encircling the limb eleven times."During this part of the operation they admonished him to confess the
blasphemy; but he only answered that he had never spoken a sentence
of such a kind, and then, resigning himself to suffer, repeated the
Athanasian creed, and prayed to God and our Lady many times.Being
still bound, they raised his head, covered his face with a piece of fine
linen, and, forcing open the mouth, caused water to drip into it from an
earthen jar, slightly perforated at the bottom, producing in addition
to his sufferings from distension, a horrid sensation of choking.But
again, when they removed the jar for a moment, he declared that he had
never uttered such a sentence; and this he often repeated.They then
pulled the cords on his right leg, cutting into the flesh, replaced the
linen on his face, dropped the water as before, and tightened the cords
on his right leg the second time; but still he maintained that he
had never spoken such a thing; and in answer to the questions of his
tormentors, constantly reiterated that he HAD NEVER SPOKEN THOSE WORDS.Moriz then pronounced that the said torture should be regarded as
begun, but not finished; and De Salas was released, to live, if he could
survive, in the incessant apprehension that if he gave the slightest
umbrage to a familiar, he would be carried again into the same chamber,
and be RACKED IN EVERY LIMB."Llorente also relates, from the original records, another case quite as
cruel and unjust as the above."On the 8th day of December, 1528, one
Catalina, a woman of BAD CHARACTER, informed the inquisitors that,
EIGHTEEN YEARS BEFORE she had lived in the house with a Morisco named
Juan, by trade a coppersmith, and a native of Segovia; that she had
observed that neither he nor his children ate pork or drank wine, and
that, on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings they used to wash their
feet, which custom, as well as abstinence from pork and wine, was
peculiar to the Moors.The old man was at that time an inhabitant of
Benevente, and seventy-one years of age.But the inquisitors at once
summoned him into their presence, and questioned him at three several
interviews.All that he could tell was, that he received baptism when he
was forty-five years of age; that having never eaten pork or drunk wine,
he had no taste for them; and that, being coppersmiths, they found it
necessary to wash themselves thoroughly once a week.After some other
examinations, they sent him back to Benevente, with prohibition to go
beyond three leagues' distance from the town.Two years afterwards the
inquisitor determined that he should be threatened with torture, IN
ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP THEM TO CRIMINATE OTHERS.He was accordingly taken to Valladolid, and in a subterranean chamber,
called the 'chamber, or dungeon, of torment,' stripped naked, and bound
to the 'ladder.'This might well have extorted something like confession
from an old man of seventy-one; but he told them that whatever he might
say when under torture would be merely extorted by the extreme anguish,
and therefore unworthy of belief; that he would not, through fear of
pain, confess what had never taken place.They kept him in close prison
until the next Auto de Fe, when he walked among the penitents, with a
lighted candle in his hand, and, after seeing others burnt to death,
paid the holy office a fee of four ducats, and went home, not acquitted,
but released.He was not summoned again, as he died soon afterwards."It sometimes happened that an individual was arrested by mistake, and
a person who was entirely innocent was tortured instead of the real or
supposed criminal.Bower found related at length
in the "Annals of the Inquisition at Macerata.""An order was sent from the high tribunal at Rome to all the inquisitors
throughout Italy, enjoining them to apprehend a clergyman minutely
described in that order.One Answering the description in many
particulars being discovered in the diocese of Osimo, at a small
distance from Macerata, and subject to that Inquisition, he was there
decoyed into the holy office, and by an order from Rome SO RACKED AS TO
LOSE HIS SENSES.In the mean time, the true person being apprehended,
the unhappy wretch was dismissed, by a second order from Rome, but he
never recovered the use of his senses, NOR WAS ANY CARE TAKEN OF HIM BY
THE INQUISITION."It would be easy to fill a volume with such narratives as the above, but
we forbear.We are not writing a history of the Inquisition.We simply
wish to exhibit the true spirit by which the Romanists are actuated in
their dealings with those over whom they have power.We therefore, in
closing this chapter of horrors, beg leave to place before our readers
one of the FATHERLY BENEDICTIONS with which, His Holiness, the Pope,
dismisses his refractory subjects.Does it not show most convincingly
what he would do here in America, if he had, among us, the power he
formerly possessed in the old world, when the least inadvertent word
might perchance seal the doom of the culprit?A POPISH BULL OK CURSE."Pronounced on all who leave the Church of Rome.By the authority of God
Almighty, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and the undefiled Virgin
Mary, mother and patroness of our Saviour, and of all celestial virtues,
Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Powers, Cherubim and Seraphim,
and of all the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, and of all the Apostles and
Evangelists, of the holy innocents, who in the sight of the holy Lamb
are found worthy to sing the new song of the Holy Martyrs and Holy
Confessors, and of all the Holy Virgins, and of all the Saints, together
with the Holy Elect of God,--MAY HE BE DAMNED.We excommunicate and
anathematize him, from the threshold of the holy church of God Almighty.We sequester him, that he may be tormented, disposed, and be delivered
over with Datham and Abiram, and with those who say unto the Lord,
'Depart from us, we desire none of thy ways;' as a fire is quenched with
water, so let the light of him be put out forevermore, unless it shall
repent him, and make satisfaction."May the Father who creates man, curse him.May the Son, who suffered
for us, curse him!May the Holy Ghost who is poured out in baptism,
curse him!May the Holy Cross, which Christ for our salvation,
triumphing over his enemies, ascended, curse him!"May the Holy Mary, ever Virgin and Mother of God, curse him!May all
the Angels, Principalities, and Powers, and all heavenly Armies curse
him!May the glorious band of the Patriarchs and Prophets curse him!John the Precursor, and St John the Baptist, and St.Andrew and all other of Christ's Apostles together
curse him and may the rest of the Disciples and Evangelists who by their
preaching converted the universe, and the Holy and wonderful company
of Martyrs and Confessors, who by their works are found pleasing to God
Almighty; may the holy choir of the Holy Virgins, who for the honor of
God have despised the things of the world, damn him.May all the Saints
from the beginning of the world to everlasting ages, who are found to be
beloved of God, damn him!"May he be damned wherever he be, whether in the house or in the alley,
in the woods or in the water, or in the church!May he be cursed in
living or dying!"May he be cursed in eating and drinking, in being hungry, in being
thirsty, in fasting and sleeping, in slumbering, and in sitting, in
living, in working, in resting, and in blood letting!May he be cursed
in all the faculties of his body!"May he be cursed inwardly and outwardly.May he be cursed in his hair;
cursed be he in his brains, and his vertex, in his temples, in his
eyebrows, in his cheeks, in his jaw-bones, in his nostrils, in his
teeth, and grinders, in his lips, in his shoulders, in his arms, and in
his fingers."May he be damned in his mouth, in his breast, in his heart, and
purtenances, down to the very stomach!"May he be cursed in his reins and groins, in his thighs and his hips,
and in his knees, his legs and his feet, and his toe-nails!"May he be cursed in all his joints, and articulation of the members;
from the crown of the head to the soles of his feet, may there be no
soundness!"May the Son of the living God, with all the glory of his majesty, CURSE
HIM!And may Heaven, with all the powers that move therein, rise
up against him, and curse and damn him; unless he repent and make
satisfaction!Such was the CURSE pronounced on the Rev.Hogan, (a converted Roman
Catholic priest) a few years since, in Philadelphia.As a further proof of the cruel, persecuting spirit of Catholicism, let
us glance at a few extracts from their own publications."Children," they say, "are obliged to denounce their parents or
relations who are guilty of heresy; ALTHOUGH THEY KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE
BURNT.They may refuse them all nourishment, and permit them to die
with hunger; or they may KILL THEM as enemies, who violate the rights of
humanity.--Escobar, Theolg."A man condemned by the Pope, may be killed wherever he is found.""Children may kill their parents, if they would turn their children
from the Popish faith.""If a judge decide contrary to law, the injured
person may defend himself by killing the judge."--Fangundez Precept
Decal, vol."To secretly kill your calumniator, to avoid scandal, is
justifiable.""You may kill before hand, any person who may put you to death,
not EXCEPTING THE JUDGE, AND WITNESSES, because it is
self-defence.""A priest may kill those who hinder him from taking possession of any
Ecclesiastical office.""You may charge your opponent with false crime to take away his credit,
as well as kill him."--Guimenius, prop, 8, p."Priests may kill the laity to preserve their goods.""You may kill any man to save a crown.""BY THE COMMAND OF GOD IT IS LAWFUL TO MURDER THE INNOCENT, TO ROB, AND
TO COMMIT ALL KIND OF WICKEDNESS, BECAUSE HE IS THE LORD OF LIFE
AND DEATH, AND ALL THINGS; AND THUS TO FULFILL HIS MANDATE IS OUR
DUTY."Again, in the Romish Creed found in the pocket of Priest Murphy, who was
killed in the battle of Arklow, 1798, we find the following articles."We acknowledge that the priests can make vice virtue, and virtue vice,
according to their pleasure."We are bound to believe that the holy massacre was lawful, and lawfully
put into execution, against Protestants, and likewise WE ARE TO CONTINUE
THE SAME, PROVIDED WITH SAFETY TO OUR LIVES!"We are bound not to keep our oaths with heretics, though bound by the
most sacred ties.We are bound not to believe their oaths; for their
principles are damnation.We are bound to drive heretics with fire,
sword, <DW19>, and confusion, out of the land; as our holy fathers say,
if their heresies prevail we will become their slaves.We are bound
to absolve without money or price, those who imbrue their hands in
the blood of a heretic!"Do not these extracts show very clearly that
Romanism can do things as bad as anything in the foregoing narrative?Whenever we refer to the relentless cruelties of the Romanists, we are
told, and that, too, by the influential, the intelligent, those who are
well-informed on other subjects, that "these horrid scenes transpired
only in the 'dark ages;'" that "the civilization and refinement of the
present age has so modified human society, so increased the milk of
human kindness, that even Rome would not dare, if indeed she had the
heart, to repeat the cruelties of by-gone days."For the honor of humanity we could hope that this opinion was correct;
but facts of recent date compel us to believe that it is as false as it
is ruinous to the best interests of our country and the souls of men.A few of these facts, gathered from unquestionable sources, and some of
them related by the actors and sufferers themselves, we place before the
reader.In November, 1854, Ubaldus Borzinski, a monk of the Brothers of Mercy,
addressed an earnest petition to the Pope, setting forth the shocking
immoralities practised in the convents of his order in Bohemia.He specifies nearly forty crimes, mostly perpetrated by priors and
subpriors, giving time, place, and other particulars, entreating the
Pope to interpose his power, and correct those horrible abuses.For sending this petition, he was thrown into a madhouse of the Brothers
of Mercy, at Prague, where he still languishes in dreary confinement,
though the only mark of insanity he ever showed was in imagining that
the Pope would interfere with the pleasures of the monks.This Ubaldus has a brother, like minded with himself, also a member of
the same misnamed order of monks, who has recently effected his escape
from durance vile.John Evangelist Borzinski was a physician in the convent of the Brothers
of Mercy at Prague.By the
study of the Psalms and Lessons from the New Testament, which make up
a considerable part of the Breviary used in cloisters, he was first
led into Protestant views.He had been for seventeen years resident in
different cloisters of his order, as sick-nurse, alms gatherer,
student, and physician, and knew the conventual life out and out.As he
testifies: "There was little of the fear of God, so far as I could
see, little of true piety; but abundance of hypocrisy, eye-service,
deception, abuse of the poor sick people in the hospitals, such love
and hatred as are common among the children of this world, and the most
shocking vices of every kind."He now felt disgust for the cloister life, and for the Romish religion,
and he sought, by the aid of divine grace, to attain to the new birth
through the Word of God.Speaking of his change of views to a Prussian
clergyman, he thus describes his conversion: "Look you, it was thus I
became a Protestant.I found a treasure in that dustheap, and went away
with it."He then thought
within himself, if these detached passages can give such light, what an
illumination he must receive if he could read and understand the whole
Bible.He did not, however, betray his dissatisfaction, but devoted himself
to his professional duties with greater diligence.He might still have
remained in the Order, his life hid with Christ in God, had not the
hierarchy, under pretence of making reforms and restoring the neglected
statutes of the Order, brought in such changes for the worse as led him
to resolve to leave the order, and the Romish church as well.Following
his convictions, and the advice of a faithful but very cautious
clergyman, he betook himself to the territories of Prussia, where, on
the 17th of January, 1855, he was received into the national church at
Petershain, by Dr.Nowotny, himself formerly a Bohemian priest.This was
not done till great efforts had been made to induce him to change his
purpose, and also to get his person into the power of his adversaries.As he had now left the church of Rome, become an openly acknowledged
member of another communion, he thought he might venture to return to
his own country.Taking leave of his Prussian friends, to whom he had
greatly endeared himself by his modesty and his lively faith, he went
back to Bohemia, with a heart full of peace and joy.He lived for some time amidst many perplexities, secluded in the house
of his parents at Prosnitz, till betrayed by some who dwelt in the same
habitation.On the 6th of March he was taken out of bed, at eight, by
the police, and conveyed first to the cloister in Prosnitz, where he
suffered much abuse, and from thence to the cloister in Prague.Here the
canon Dittrich, "Apostolical Convisitator of the Order of the Brothers
of Mercy," justified all the inhuman treatment he had suffered, and
threatened him with worse in case he refused to recant and repent.Dittrich not only deprived him of his medical books, but told him that
his going over to Protestantism was a greater crime than if he had
plundered the convent of two thousand florins.He was continually dinned
with the cry, "Retract, retract!"He was not allowed to see his brother,
confined in the same convent, nor other friends, and was so sequestered
in his cell as to make him feel that he was forgotten by all the world.He managed, through some monks who secretly sympathized with him, to get
a letter conveyed occasionally to Dr.These letters were filled
with painful details of the severities practised upon him.In one of
them he says, "My only converse is with God, and the gloomy walls around
me."He was transferred to a cell in the most unwholesome spot, and
infested with noisome smells not to be described.Close by him were
confined some poor maniacs, sunk below the irrational brutes.Under date of April 23d he writes: "Every hour, in this frightful
dungeon seems endless to me.For many weeks have I sat idle in this
durance, with no occupation but prayer and communion with God."His
appeals to civil authority and to the Primate of Hungary procured him no
redress, but only subjected him to additional annoyances and hardships.His aged father, a man of four-score years, wept to see him, though of
sound understanding, locked up among madmen; and when urged to make his
son recant, would have nothing to do with it, and returned the same
day to his sorrowful home.As he had been notified that he was to be
imprisoned for life, he prayed most earnestly to the Father of mercies
for deliverance; and he was heard, for his prayers and endeavors wrought
together.The sinking of his health increased his efforts to escape;
for, though he feared not to die, he could not bear the thought of dying
imprisoned in a mad-house, where he knew that his enemies would take
advantage of his mortal weakness to administer their sacraments to him,
and give out that he had returned to the bosom of the church, or at
least to shave his head, that he might be considered as an insane
person, and his renunciation of Romanism as the effect of derangement
of mind.Several plans of escape were projected, all beset with much
difficulty and danger.The one he decided upon proved to be successful.On Saturday, the 13th of October, at half-past nine in the evening, he
fastened a cord made of strips of linen to the grate of a window, which
grate did not extend to the top.Having climbed over this, he lowered
himself into a small court-yard.He had now left that part of the
establishment reserved for the insane, and was now in the cloistered
part where the brethren dwelt.He saw
at a distance a servant of the insane approaching with a light; and
with aching heart and trembling limbs, by a desperate effort, climbed
up again.He returned to his cell, concealing his cord, and laid himself
down to rest.On the following Monday, he renewed his efforts to escape.He lowered
himself, as before, into the little court-yard; but being weak in health
and much shaken in his nervous system by all he had suffered in body and
mind, he was seized with palpitation of the heart and trembled all over,
so that he could not walk a step.He laid down to rest and recover his
breath.He felt as if he could get no further."But," he says in his
affecting narrative, "My dear Saviour to whom I turned in this time of
need, helped me wonderfully.I felt now, more than ever in my life, His
gracious and comforting presence, and believed, in that dismal moment,
with my whole soul, His holy word;" "My grace is sufficient for thee;
for my strength is made perfect in weakness."Borzinski now arose, pulled off his boots, and though every step was
made with difficulty, he ascended the stairs leading to the first story.He went along the passage way until he came to a door leading into
corridors where the cloister brethren lodged.But the trembling fit came
over him again, with indescribable anguish, as he sought to open the
door with a key with which he had been furnished.He soon rallied again,
and, like a spectre, gliding by the doors of the brethren, who occupied
the second and third corridors, many of whom had lights still burning,
he came with his boots in one hand, and his bundle in the other, to
a fourth passage way, in which was an outside window he was trying to
reach.The cord was soon fastened to the window frame, yet still in
bitter apprehension; for this window was seldom opened, and opened
hard, and with some noise.It was also only two steps distant from the
apartment of the cloister physician, where there was a light, and it was
most likely that, on the first grating of the window, he would rush
out and apprehend the fugitive.However the window was opened without
raising any alarm, and now it was necessary to see that no one was
passing below; for though the spot is not very much frequented, yet
the streets cross there, and people approach it from four different
directions.During these critical moments, one person and another kept
passing, and poor Borzinski tarried shivering in the window for near a
quarter of an hour before he ventured to let himself down.While he
was waiting his opportunity he heard the clock strike the third quarter
after nine and knew that he had but fifteen minutes to reach the house
where he was to conceal himself, which would be closed at ten.When all
was still, he called most fervently on the Saviour, and grasping the
cord, slid down into the street.He could scarce believe his feet were
on the ground.Trembling now with joy and gratitude rather than fear, he
ran bareheaded to his place of refuge, where he received a glad welcome.Having changed his garb, and tarried till three o'clock in the morning,
he took leave of his friends and passing through the gloomy old capital
of Bohemia, he reached the Portzitscher Gate, in order to pass out
as early as possible.Just then a police corporal let in a wagon, and
Borzinski, passed out unchallenged.It is needless to follow him further
in his flight.We have given enough, of his history to prove that
conventual establishments are at this moment what they ever have
been--dangerous alike to liberty and life.AMERICAN AND FOREIGN
CHRISTIAN UNION.In place of labored arguments we give the following history of personal
suffering as strikingly illustrative of the spirit of Romanism at the
present day.APPENDIX VII

NARRATIVE OP SIGNORINA FLORIENCIA D' ROMANI, A NATIVE OF THE CITY OF
NAPLES.I was born in the year 1826, of noble and wealthy parents.Our mansion
contained a small chapel, with many images, sacred paintings, and a
neatly furnished mass altar.As he lived on the rents and income
of his estates, he had little to do, except to amuse himself with his
friends.My mother, who was of as mild and sweet disposition, loved my
father very dearly, but was very unhappy the most of the time because
my father spent so much of his time in drinking with his dissolute
companions, card playing, and in balls, parties, theatres, operas,
billiards, &c. Father did not intend to be unkind to my mother, for he
gave her many servants, and abundance of gold, horses, carriages and
grooms, and said frequently in my hearing, that his wife should be as
happy as a princess.Such was the state of society in Italy that men
thought their wives had no just reason to complain, so long as they were
furnished with plenty of food, raiment and shelter.One of my father's most intimate friends was the very Rev.Father
Salvator, a Priest of the order of St.Francis; he wore the habit of
the order, his head was about half shaved.The sleeves of his habit were
very large at the elbow; in these sleeves he had small pockets, in which
he usually carried his snuff box, handkerchief, and purse of gold.This
priest was merry, full of fun and frolic; he could dance, sing, play
cards, and tell admirably funny stories, such as would make even the
devils laugh in their chains.Such was the influence and power this Franciscan had over my father and
mother, that in our house, his word was law.He was our confessor, knew
the secrets and sins, and all the weak points of every mind in the whole
household.My own dear mother taught me to read before I was seven years
of age.As I was the only child, I was much petted and caressed, indeed,
such was my mother's affection for me that I was seldom a moment out of
her sight.There was a handsome mahogany confessional in our own chapel.When the priest wanted any member of the household to come to him to
confession, he wrote the name on a slate that hung outside the chapel
door, saying that he would hear confessions at such a time to-morrow.Thus, we would always have time for the full examination of our
consciences.Only one at a time was ever admitted into the chapel, for
confessional duty, and the priest always took care to lock the door
inside and place the key in his sleeve pocket.My mother and myself were
obliged to confess once a week; the household servants, generally once a
month.My father only once a year, during Lent, when all the inhabitants
of seven years, and upwards, are obliged to kneel down to the priests,
in the confessional, and receive the wafer God under the severest
penalties.Woe to the individual who resists the ecclesiastical mandate.When I was about fourteen years of age, I was sent to the Ursuline
Convent, to receive my education.My dear mother would have preferred
a governess or a competent teacher to teach me at home but her will was
but a mere straw in the hands of our confessor and priestly tyrant.It
was solely at the recommendation of the confessor, that I was imprisoned
four years in the Ursuline Convent.As my confessor was also the
confessor of the convent, he called himself my guardian and protector,
and recommended me to the special care of the Mother Abbess, and her
holy nuns, the teachers, who spent much of their time in the school
department.As my father paid a high price, quarterly, for my tuition
and board, I had a good room to myself, my living was of the best kind,
and I always had wine at dinner.The nuns, my teachers, took much more
pains to teach me the fear of the Pope, bishops and confessors, than
the fear of God, or the love of virtue.In fact, with the exception of a
little Latin and embroidery, which I learned in those four years, I came
out as ignorant as I was before, unless a little hypocrisy may be called
a useful accomplishment.For, of all human beings on earth, none can
teach hypocrisy so well as the Romish priests and nuns.In the school
department young ladies seldom have much to complain of, unless they are
charity scholars; in that case the poor girls have to put up with very
poor fare, and much hard work, hard usage and even heavy blows; how my
heart has ached for some of those unfortunate girls, who are treated
more like brutes, than human beings, because they are orphans, and poor.Yet they in justice are entitled to good treatment, for thousands of
scudi (dollars) are sent as donations to the convents for the support
of these orphans, every year, by benevolent individuals.So that as poor
and unfortunate as these girls are, they are a source of revenue to the
convents.For the first three years of my convent life, I passed the time in
the school department, without much anxiety of mind.I was gay and
thoughtless, my great trouble was to find something to amuse myself,
and kill time in some way.Though I treated all the school-mates with
kindness, and true Italian politeness, I became intimate with only one.She was a beautiful girl, from the dukedom of Tuscany.She made me her
confidant, and told me all her heart.Her parents were wealthy, and both
very strict members of the Romish Church.But she had an aunt in the
city of Geneva, who was a follower of John Calvin, or a member of the
Christian church of Switzerland.This aunt had been yearly a visitor at
her father's house.She being her father's only sister, an affectionate
intimacy was formed between the aunt and niece.The aunt, being a very
pious, amiable woman, felt it her duty to impress the mind of the niece,
with the superiority of the religion of the holy bible over popish
traditions; and the truth of the Scriptures soon found its way to the
heart of my young friend.But her confessor soon found out that some
change was going on in her mind, and told her father.There were
only two ways to save her soul from utter ruin; one was to give her
absolution and kill her before she got entirely out of the holy mother
church; the other, was to send her to the Ursuline convent at Naples,
where by the zeal and piety of those celebrated nuns, she might be
secured from further heresy.From this, the best friend of my school days, I learned more about God's
word, and virtue, and truth, and the value of the soul, than from all
other sources.There was a garden surrounded by a high wall, in which we
frequently walked, and whispered to each other, though we trembled all
the while for fear our confessor would by some means, find out that we
looked upon the Romish church as the Babylon destined to destruction,
plainly spoken of by St.My young friend stood in great fear of the priests; she trembled at the
very sight of one.Her aunt had read to her the history and sufferings of the persecuted
Protestants of Europe.She was a frail, and timid girl, yet such was the
depth of her piety and the fervor of her religious faith, that she often
declared to me that she would prefer death to the abandonment of those
heavenly principles she had embraced, which were the source of her
joy and hope.Her aunt gave her a pocket New Testament, in the Italian
language, which she prized above all the treasures of earth, and carried
with her carefully, wherever she went.I borrowed it and read it every
opportunity I had.I took much
pains to commit to memory all I could of the blessed book, for in
case of our separation, I knew not where I could obtain another.My
god-father who was a bishop, called to see me on my fifteenth birth day,
and presented me with a splendid gold watch and chain richly studded
with jewels, made in England, and valued at 200 scudi, saying that
he had it imported expressly for my use.I had also several diamond
articles of jewelry, presents I had received from my father from time to
time.I had also, in my purse, 100 scudi in gold, which I had saved from
my pin money.All the above property, I should have cheerfully given for
a copy of the Holy Bible, in my own beautiful Italian language.A few
months after I received the rich present from the Bishop, he called with
my father and my confessor to see me.My heart almost came into my mouth
when I saw them alight from my father's carriage, and enter the chapel
door of the convent.Very soon the lady porter came to me and said,
"Signorina, you are wanted in the parlor."As my Tuscan friend had taught me to pray, and ask the Lord Jesus for
grace and strength, I walked into my room, locked the door, and on my
knees, called upon the Lord to save me from becoming a nun--for I
knew then it was a determination on the part of the Abbess, bishop
and confessor, that I should take the veil.I was the only child, and
heiress of an immense fortune, of course, too good a prize to be lost.After a short and fervent prayer to my Lord and Saviour, I walked down
to see what was to be my doom.I kissed my father's cheek, and kissed
the hands of the Bishop and confessor--yet my very soul revolted
from the touch of these whited sepulchres.All received me with great
cordiality, yea, even more than usual affection.Soon after our meeting,
my father asked permission of the Bishop to speak to me privately and
taking me into a small room, said to me, "My dear daughter, you are not
aware of the great misfortune that has recently come upon your father.While I was excited with wine at the card-table last evening, betting
high and winning vast sums of money, I so far forgot myself and my duty
to the laws of the country, that I called for a toast, and induced
a number of my inebriated companions to drink the health of Italian
liberty, and we all drank and gave three cheers for liberty and a
liberal constitution.A Benedictine Friar being present, took all our
names to the Commissary General, and offered to be a witness against
us in the King's Court.As this is my first and only offence, the holy
Bishop your god-father offers on certain conditions, to visit Rome
immediately on my behalf, and secure the mediation of the holy Father
Pius IX.Your venerable god-father has great influence at Rome, being
a special favorite with his holiness, and his holiness can obtain any
favor he asks of King Ferdinand.So if you will only consent to take the
Black Veil, your father will be saved from the State prison."This was terrible news to my young and palpitating heart.It was the
first heavy blow that I had experienced in this vale of tears.I did not
speak for some minutes; I could not.My trembling bosom heaved like the
waves of the ocean before the blast.My veins were almost bursting; my
hands and feet became as cold as marble, and when I attempted to speak
my words seemed ready to choke me to death.I fell upon my knees and called upon God for mercy and help.My
father, thinking I had gone mad, was greatly alarmed.The Bishop
and confessor, who were anxiously waiting the result of my father's
proposition, hearing my father weep and sob aloud, came in to see what
the matter was.In the midst of my prayer, I fainted away, and became
entirely unconscious.When I came to myself, I found myself on the bed.As I opened my eyes, it all seemed like a dream.The abbess spoke to me
very kindly, and sprinkled my bed with holy water, and at the same time
laid a large bronze crucifix on my breast, saying that Satan must be
driven from my soul, for had it not been for the devil, I would have
leaped for joy, and not fainted when father mentioned the black veil."No," said the holy mother, "had it not been for the devil you would
rejoice to take the holy black veil blessed by the Holy Madonna and the
blessed saints Clara and Theresa.It is a holy privilege that very few
can enjoy on earth.Yea, my daughter, there can not be a greater sin
in the sight of the Madonna and the blessed saints, than to reject a
secluded life.Yea," said the crafty old nun, (who was thinking much
more about my gold, than my soul,) "I never knew a young lady who had
the offer of becoming a nun and rejected it, who ever came to a good
end.If they refuse, and marry, they generally die in child-bed with the
first child, or they will marry cruel husbands, who beat them and kill
them by inches.Therefore, dear daughter, let me most affectionately
warn you as you have had the honor of being selected by the holy Bishop
and our holy confessor to the high dignity and privilege of a professed
nun, of the order of St.Ursula, reject it not at your peril.Be
assured, heaven knows how to punish such rebellion."My head ached so violently at the time, and I was so feverish that I
begged the old woman to send for my mother, and to talk to me no more on
the subject of the black veil, but to drop it until some future time.In
my agony on account of the foul plot against my liberty, my virtue, and
my gold, I felt such a passion of rage come upon me, that had I absolute
power for the moment I would have cast every Abbess, Pope, Bishop and
Priest into the bottomless pit.May the Lord forgive me, but I would
have done it at that time with a good will.The greatest comfort I now
had was reading my Tuscan friend's New Testament, or hearing it read by
her when we had a chance to be by ourselves, which was not very often.In the evening of the same day of my illness, father and mother came to
see me, and Satan came also in the shape of the confessor; so that I
had not a moment alone with my dear parents.The confessor feared my
determined opposition to a convent's life, for he had previous to this,
several times in the confessional, dropped hints to me on the great
happiness, purity, serenity and joy of all holy nuns.But I always told
him I would not be a nun for the world.I should be so good, it would
kill me in a short time."No, no, father," said I, "I WILL NOT BE A
NUN."Father spoke to me again of his great misfortune--told me that his trial
would come on in a few days and that he was now at liberty on a
very heavy bail; that the Bishop was only waiting my answer to start
immediately for the holy city, and throw himself at the feet of the holy
Pope to procure father's unconditional pardon from the King.I said
"my dear father, how long will you be imprisoned if you do not get a
pardon?""From two to five years," he replied."My daughter, it is
my first offence, and I have witnesses to prove that the priest who
appeared against me, urged me to drink wine several times after I had
drank a large quantity, and was the direct cause of my saying what
I did."Now it all came to me, that the whole of it was a plot, a
Jesuitical trick, to get my father in the clutches of the law, and then
make a slave of me for life through my sympathy for my dear father.The vile priests knew that I loved my father most ardently; in fact, my
father and mother were the only two beings on earth that I did love.My
mother I loved most tenderly, but my affection for my father was of a
different kind.I loved him most violently, with all the ardor of my
soul.Mother seemed all the home to me; but father was to me all the
world beside.He would frequently
come home, and get me to go out into the garden and play with him,
just as though he was my brother.There we would swing, run, jump and
exercise in several healthy games, common in our climate.He never gave
me an unkind word or an unkind reproof.If I did say anything wrong, he
would take me to my mother and say, "Clara, here I bring you a prisoner,
let her be kept on bread and water till dinner time."Even when mother
had displeased him about some trifle, so that he had not a smile for
her, he always had a smile for his Flora.Even now, while I write, a
chill comes over my frame, while I think of that vile Popish plot.I
said to my father, "You shall not be imprisoned if I can prevent it; at
the same time I do not see any great gain, comfort or profit in having
your only daughter put in prison for life, without the hope of liberty
ever more, to save you from two years imprisonment."At these words, the eyes of the confessor flashed like lurid lightnings;
his very frame shook, as though he had the fever and ague.Truth seemed
so strange to the priest, that he found it hard of digestion.Father
and mother both wept, but made no reply.The idea of putting their only
child in a dungeon for life, though it might be done in the sacred name
of religion, did not seem to give them much comfort "Father," said I, "I
wish to see you at ten o'clock to-morrow morning, without fail--I wish
to see you alone; don't bring mother or any one else with you.You shall
not go to prison, all will yet be well."On account of this reasonable
request, to see my father alone, the confessor arose in a terrible rage
and left the apartment As quick as the mad priest left us to ourselves,
I told my father my plan, or what I would like to do with his
permission.My plan was, for my mother and myself to get into our
carriage and drive to the palace of King Ferdinand and make him
acquainted with all the truth; for I was aware from what I had heard,
that the King had heard only the priest's side of the story.My father
stood in such fear of the priests that he only consented to my plan with
great reluctance, saying that we ought first to make our plan known to
the confessor, lest he should be offended.To this my mother responded,
saying, "My daughter, it would be very wrong for us to go to the King,
or take any step without the advice of our spiritual guide."Here,
I felt it to be my duty to reveal to my deceived parents some of the
secrets of the confessional, though I might, in their estimation,
be guilty of an unpardonable sin by breaking the seal of iniquity.I
revealed to my parents the frequent efforts of the priest to obtain my
consent to take the veil, and that I had opposed from first to last,
every argument made use of to rob me of the society of my parents, of my
liberty, and of everything I held dear on earth.As to the happiness of
the nuns so much talked of by the priests, from what I had seen in their
daily walk and general deportment, I was fully convinced that there was
no reality in it; they were mere slaves to their superiors, and not half
so happy as the free slaves on a plantation who have a kind master.My
parents saw my determination to resist to the death every plan for my
imprisonment in the hateful nunnery.Therefore they promised that I
should have the opportunity to see the King on the morrow in company
with my mother.On the following day, at twelve o'clock, we left the convent in our
carriage for the palace.We were very politely received by the gentleman
usher, who conducted us to seats in the reception-room.After sending
our cards to the king, we waited nearly one hour before he made his
appearance.His majesty received us with much kindness, raised us
immediately from our knees, and demanded our business.I was greatly
embarrassed at first, but the frank and cordial manner of the sovereign
soon restored me to my equilibrium, and I spoke freely in behalf of my
dear father.The king heard me through very patiently, with apparent
interest, and said, "Signorina, I am inclined to believe you have spoken
the truth; and as your father has always been a good loyal subject, I
shall, for your sake, forgive him this offence; but let him beware that
henceforth, wine or no wine, he does not trespass against the laws
of the kingdom, for a second offence I will not pardon.Go in peace,
signoras, you have my royal word."We thanked his majesty, and returned to our home with the joyful
tidings.My father, who had been waiting the
result of our visit to the palace with great impatience, received us
with open arms, and pressed us to his heart again and again.I was so excited that, long before we got to him, I cried out, "All is
well, all is well, father.We drove
home, and father went immediately to spread the happy news amongst
his friends.All our faithful domestics, including my old affectionate
nurse, were so overjoyed at the news that they danced about like
maniacs.My father was always a very indulgent and liberal master,
furnished his servants with the best of Italian fare, plenty of
fresh beef, wine, and macaroni.We had scarcely got rested, when our
tormenter, the confessor, came into our room and said, "Signoras, what
is the meaning of all this fandango and folly amongst the servants?ARE
THE HERETICS ALL KILLED, that there should be such joy, or has the queen
been delivered of a son, an heir to the throne?"My dear mother was now as pale as death, and silent, for she saw that
the priest was awfully enraged; for, although he feigned to smile, his
smile was similar to that of the hyena when digging his prey out of
the grave.The priest's dark and villainous visage had the effect of
confirming in my mother's mind all the truth regarding the plot to
enslave me for life, and secure all my father's estate to the pockets
of the priests.The confessor was now terribly mad, for two obvious
reasons: one was because he was not received by us with our usual
cordiality and blind affection; the other, because, by the king's
pardon, I was not under the necessity to sacrifice my liberty and
happiness for life to save my father from prison; and what tormented him
the most was, that he believed that I, though young, could understand
and thwart his hellish plans.As my mother trembled and was silent,
fearing the priest was cursing her and her only daughter in his
heart,--for the priests tell such awful stories about the effects of a
priest's curse that the great mass of the Italian people fear it more
than the plague or any earthly misfortune.Peter is the doorkeeper of the great
city of God, the heavenly Jerusalem, that he has the keys of the kingdom
of heaven, and has received strict orders not to admit any soul, under
any circumstances, who has been cursed by a holy priest, unless that
curse has been removed by the same priest in the tribunal of penance.I
was obliged to speak to his reverence, and I felt so free, so happy in
Christ as my only hope, that I opened my mind to the priest very freely,
and told him what I thought of him and his plot."Sir priest," said I,
"I shall never return to the convent to stay long.As soon as the time
for my education ends, I shall return to liberty and domestic life.I
am not made of the proper material to make a nun of.I love the social
domestic circle; I love my father and mother, and all our domestics,
even the dogs and the cats, pigeons, and canaries, the fish-ponds,
play-grounds, gardens, rivers, and landscapes, mountain and ocean,--all
the works of God I love.I shall live out of the convent to enjoy these
things; therefore, reverend sir, if you value my peace and good-will,
never speak to me or my parents on the subject of my becoming a nun in
any convent.I shall prefer death to the loss of my personal liberty."I was so decided, and had received such strength and grace from heaven,
that the priest was dumbfounded,--my smooth stone out of the sling
had hit him in the right place.After much effort to appear bland and
good-natured, he drew near my chair, seized my hand, and said, "My dear
daughter, you mistake me.I love you as a daughter, I wish only your
happiness.Your god-father, the holy Bishop, does not intend that you
shall remain a common nun more than a year.After the first year you
shall be raised to the highest dignity in the convent.You shall be the
Lady Superior, and all the nuns shall bow at your feet, and implicitly
obey your commands.Clara is now very old, and his lordship wishes
soon to fill her place.For that purpose he has selected his adopted
daughter.Your talents, education, wealth, and high position in society,
eminently fit you for one of the highest dignities on earth.""A thousand thanks for the kindness of my lord Bishop," said I; "but
your reverence has not altered my mind in the least.I can never bow
down to the feet of any Lady Superior, neither will I ever consent to
see a single human being degraded at my feet.The holy Bible says, 'Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.'"exclaimed the priest, "Where did you see that dangerous
book?Know you not that his holiness the Pope has placed it in the
Index Expurgatorius, because it has been the means of the damnation of
millions of souls?Not because it is in itself a bad book, but because
it is a theological work, prepared only for the priests and ministers of
our holy religion.Therefore, it is always a very dangerous book in
the hands of women or laymen, who wrest the Scriptures to their own
destruction.""Well, reverend sir," I replied, "you seem determined to differ from the
Lord Jesus and his apostles.I read in the New Testament that we should
search the Scriptures because they testify of Christ.And one of the
apostles, I don't remember which, said, 'all scripture is given by the
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine and for instruction
in righteousness.'Now, reverend sir, if the people have souls, as well
as the priests, why should they not read the word of God which speaks of
Christ and is profitable for instruction?"exclaimed the priest, "and you talk very
much like one."His countenance changed to a pale sickly hue, as he
said, "My daughter, where did you get that dangerous book?If you have,
it in your possession, give it to me, and I will bless you, and pray for
you to the blessed Madonna that she may save you from the infernal pit
of heresy.""I do not own the blessed book," said I, "but I wish I did.I would give
one hundred scudi in gold for a copy of the New Testament.I borrowed a
copy from a friend, and returned it to the owner again.But I understand
that there are copies to be had in London, and when I have a good
opportunity I shall send for a copy, if I can do it unbeknown to any
one.""I shall be in the tribunal of
penance at six o'clock P.M.You need
pardon immediately, and spiritual advice.Should you die as you now are
without absolution, you would be lost and damned forever.I tremble for
you, my dear daughter, seeing that the devil has got such a powerful
hold of you.It may even be absolutely necessary to kill the body to
save your soul; for should you relapse again into heresy after due
penance for this crime has been performed, it would be impossible to
renew you again to repentance, seeing you crucify the Lord and the
Madonna afresh, and put them to an open shame."Here my mother fainted and shook like an aspen leaf.But God gave me
strength, and I said in a moment that as his reverence thought my sins
so great, I would not go to any man, no, not even to the Pope; I
would go to God alone, and leave my cause in his hands, life or death."Therefore, reverend sir, I shall save you from all further trouble in
attending the confessional any more on my account.From henceforth no
earthly power shall drag me alive and with my consent to the tribunal of
penance."exclaimed the priest furiously, "are you mad?There are ten
thousand devils in you, and we must drive them out by some means."After
this discharge of priestly venom, the priest left in a rage giving the
door a terrible slam, which awoke my mother from her sorrowful trance.During the whole conversation, such was the electrical power of the
priest over my mother's weak and nervous system, that if she attempted
to say a word in my behalf, the keen, snakish black eye of the priest
would at once make her tremble and quail before him, and the half
uttered word would remain silent on her lips.The priest went at once
in search of my father.He came home boiling over with rage, saying he
wished I had never been born.The
cause of all this paternal fury upon my poor devoted head was the foul
misrepresentations of my father confessor, who was now in league with
the Bishop, both determined to shut me up in a prison convent, or end my
mortal career.My poor mother remained mute and heart-broken.My sweet mother; never
did she utter one word of unkindness to me; her very look to the last
was one of gentleness and love.But my father loved honor and reputation
amongst men above all other things.The idea of being the father of an
accursed heretic, tormented his pride, and he being suspected of heresy
himself caused him to be forsaken by many of his proud friends and
acquaintances.He was even insulted in the streets by the numerous
Lazaroni, with the epithet of Maldito Corrobonari, so that I lost my
father's love.And when the confessor told him there was no other way
to save me from hell than an entire life of penance in a convent, he
heartily and freely gave his consent.Mother, my own sweet mother, my
only remaining friend, turned as pale as death, but was enabled to say a
word in my behalf.I saw that my earthly doom was sealed; there was not a single voice in
all Naples to save me from imprisonment for life.Not a tongue in four
hundred thousand that would dare speak one word in my behalf.Father
commanded me to get ready to leave his house forever that very night,
saying the carriage and confessor would be on hand to take me away at
eight o'clock P.M., by moonlight.I got on my knees and begged my father
as a last request that he would allow me to remain three days with my
mother, but he refused.Said he, "That is now beyond my power.Not an
hour can you remain after eight o'clock."As I knew not when I should see my Tuscan friend again, I begged the
privilege of seeing her for a few moments.I was anxious to ask her
prayers and sympathy, and to put her on her guard, for should the
priests discover her New Testament, they would punish her as they did
me, or as they intended to do to me.But this favor was denied me, and I
could not write to her, for all letters of the scholars in the
convents, are opened under the pretence to prevent them from receiving
love-letters.The Romish church keeps all her dark plans a secret, but
never allows any secret to be kept from the priests.I went into my room to bid farewell to my home forever.I fell on my
knees and prayed to God for his dear Son's sake to help me, to give me
patience, and to keep me from the sin of suicide.The more I thought
of my utterly unprotected situation and of the savage disposition of my
foes, the priests, the more I thought of the propriety of taking my own
life, rather than live in a dungeon all my days.Such was the power of
superstition over our domestics that they looked upon me as one accursed
of the church, a Protestant heretic, and not one of them would take my
hand or bid me good bye.At tea-time I was not allowed to sit at table
with father, mother, and the confessor, as formerly.But I had my supper
sent up to my room.A short time after the bell rang for vespers, the carriage being ready,
my father and the confessor with myself and one small trunk got into the
best seats inside, and rode off at a rapid rate.I kept my veil over my
face, and said not a word neither did I shed a single tear; my sorrow,
and indignation was too deep for utterance or even for tears.The priest
and my father uttered not a word.Perhaps my father's conscience
made him ashamed of such vile work--that of laying violent hands on a
defenceless girl of eighteen years of age, for no crime whatever, only
the love of liberty and pure Bible religion.But if the priest was
silent, his vile countenance indicated a degree of hellish pleasure and
satisfaction.Never did piratical captain glory more in seeing a rich
prize along side with all hands killed and out of the way, than my
reverend confessor; yet a short time before he said he loved me as a
daughter.Yes, he did love me, as the wolf loves the lamb, as the cat
loves the mouse and as the boa constrictor the beautiful gazelle.To
my momentary satisfaction we entered the big gate of St.Ursula, for
although I knew I should suffer there perhaps even death, there was some
satisfaction in seeing a few faces that I had seen in my gay and happy
days, now alas!I was somewhat grieved by the cold
reception I received.But none
of these things moved me; I looked to God for strength, for I felt that
He alone could nerve me for the conflict.The hardest blow of all was,
my dear father left me at the mercy of the priest without one kind look
or word.He did not even shake hands with me, nor did he say farewell.Oh Popery, what a mysterious power is thine!Thou canst in a few hours
destroy powerful love which it took long years to cement in loving
hearts.When my father had left and I heard the porter lock the heavy
iron gate I felt an exquisite wretchedness come over me.I would have
given worlds for death at that moment.In a few moments the priest rung
a bell, and the old Jezebel the mother Abbess made her appearance."Take
this heretic, Holy Mother, and place her in confinement in the lower
regions; GIVE HER BREAD AND WATER ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS, THE WATER
THAT YOU HAVE WASHED YOUR SACRED FEET IN, NO OTHER; give her straw
to sleep on, but no pillow.Take all her clothing away and give her a
coarse tunic; one single coarse garment to cover her nakedness, but no
shoes.She has grievously sinned against the holy mother church, and now
she mercifully imposes upon her years of severe penance, that her body
of sin may be destroyed and her soul saved after suffering one million
of years in holy purgatory.Our chief duty now, holy mother, in order
to save this lost soul from mortal sin will be to examine her carefully
every, day to ascertain if possible what she most dislikes, or what
is most revolting to her flesh, that whatever it may be, she, must be
compelled to perform it whatever it may cost.Let a holy wax candle burn
in her cell at night, until further orders.And let the Tuscan heretic
be treated in the same way.At
the word "Tuscan heretic," possessing the spirit of Christ that I knew
on earth.Yet how true it is that misery loves company; there was even
satisfaction in being near my unfortunate friend though our sufferings
might be unutterable.Still I was unhappy in the thought that she was
suffering on my account.Had I never said a word about borrowing a New
Testament, she would never have been suspected as being the direct
cause of my conversion to the truth, and of my renunciation of the vile
confessional.I was somewhat puzzled to know what kind of a place was meant by the
lower regions; I had never heard of these regions before.But soon two
women in black habits with their faces entirely covered excepting
two small holes for the eyes to peep through, came to me and without
speaking, made signs for me to follow them.I did so without resistance,
and soon found myself in an under-ground story of the infernal building."There is your cell," said the cowled inquisitors, "look all around, see
every thing, but speak not; no not for your life.The softest whisper
will immediately reach the ears of the Mother Abbess, and then you are
loaded with heavy chains until you die, for there must be no talking
or whispering in this holy retreat of penance.And," said my jailor
further, "take off your clothes, shoes and stockings, and put on this
holy coarse garment which will chafe thy flesh but will bless thy soul.Francis saved many souls by this holy garment."As resistance was worse than useless, I complied, and soon found my poor
feet aching with the cold on the bare stone floor.I was soon made to
feel the blessing of St.My sufferings were
indescribable.It seemed as though ten thousand bees had stung me in
every part.I laid on my
coarse straw and groaned and sighed for death to come and relieve me of
my anguish.As soon as the holy wax candle was left with me I took it
in my hand and went forth to survey my dungeon; but I did not enjoy
my ramble.In one of the cells, I found my Tuscan friend--that dear
Christian sister--in great agony, having had on the accursed garment for
several days.Her body was one entire blister, and very much inflamed.Her bones were racked with pain, as with the most excruciating
inflammatory rheumatism.We recognized each other; she pointed to heaven
as if to say 'trust in the Lord, my sister, our sufferings will soon
be over.'I kissed my hand to her and returned again to my cell.I
saw other victims half dead and emaciated that made my heart sick.I
refrained from speaking to any one for I feared my condition, wretched
as it was, might be rendered even worse, if possible by the fiends who
had entire power over me.said I to myself, "why was I born?O give my soul patience to suffer every pain."On the fourth day of my imprisonment the jailor brought me some water
and soap, a towel, brush and comb, and the same clothes I wore when I
entered the foul den.They told me to make haste and prepare myself to
appear before the holy Bishop.Hope revived in my soul, for I always
thought that my god-father had some regard for me, and had now come to
release me from the foul den I was in.Cold water seemed to afford much
relief to my tortured body.I made my toilet as quick as I could in such
a place.My feet were so numb and swollen that it was difficult for me
to get my shoes on.At last the Bishop arrived as I supposed, and I
was conducted--not into his presence as I expected, but into that of
my bitterest enemy, the confessor.At the very sight of the monster, I
trembled like a reed shaken by the wind.The priest walked to each of
the doors, locked them, put the keys into a small writing desk, locked
it, took out the key and placed it carefully in his sleeve pocket.This
he did to assure me that we were alone, that not one of the inmates
could by any means disturb for the present the holy meditations of the
priest.He bade me take a seat on the sofa by him.In kind soft words he
said to me, that if I was only docile and obedient, he would cause me
to be treated like a princess, and that in a short time I should have
my liberty if I preferred to return to the world.At the same time he
attempted to put his arm around my waist.While he was talking love to me, I was looking at two large alabaster
vases full of beautiful wax flowers; one of them was as much as I could
lift.Without one thought about consequences, I seized the nearest vase
and threw it with all the strength I had at the priest's head.He fell
like a log and uttered one or two groans.It
struck the priest on the right temple, close to the ear.For a moment I
listened to see if any one were coming.I then looked at the priest, and
saw the blood running out of his wound.I quaked with fear lest I had
killed the destroyer of my peace.I did not intend to kill him, I only
wished to stun him, that I might take the keys, open the door and run,
for the back door of the priest's room led right into a back path where
the gates were frequently opened daring the day time.This was about
twelve o'clock, and a most favorable moment for me to escape.In a
moment I had searched the sleeve pocket of the priest, found the key and
a heavy purse of gold which I secured in my dress pocket.I opened the
little writing desk and took out the key to the back door.I saw that
the priest was not dead, and I had not the least doubt from appearances,
but that he would soon come to.I trembled for fear he might wake before
I could get away.I thought of my dear Tuscan sister in her wretched
cell, but I could not get to her without being discovered.I opened the door with the greatest facility and gained
the opening into the back path.I locked the door after me, and brought
the key with me for a short distance, then placed all the keys tinder
a rock.I had no hat but only a black veil.I threw that over my head
after the fashion of Italy and gained the outer gate.There were masons
at work near the gate which was open and I passed through into the
street without being questioned by any one.As I had not a nun's dress on, no one supposed I belonged to the
Institution.I could speak a
few English words which I had learned from some English friends of my
father.Before I got to where the boats lay I saw a gentleman whom I
took to be an English or American gentleman.He had a pleasant face,
looked at me very kindly, saw my pale dejected face and at once felt a
deep sympathy for me.As I appeared to be in trouble and needed help,
he extended his hand to me and said in tolerable good Italian, "Como va'
le' signorina?"that is "How do you do young lady?""Me," said he, "Americano, Americano, capitano de
Bastimento.""Signor Capitano," said I,
"I wish to go on board your ship and see an American ship.""Well," said
he, "with a great deal of pleasure; my ship lies at anchor, my men are
waiting; you shall dine with me, Signorina."I praised God in my soul for this merciful providence of meeting a
friend, though a stranger, whose face seemed to me so honest and so
true.Any condition, even honest slavery, would have been preferred by
me at that time to a convent.The American ship was the most
beautiful thing I ever saw afloat; splendid and neat in all her cabin
arrangements.The mates were polite, and the sailors appeared neat and
happy.Even the black cook showed his beautiful white teeth, as though
he was glad to see one of the ladies of Italy.Little did
they know at that time what peril I was in should I be found out and
taken back to my dungeon again.I informed the captain of my situation,
of having just escaped from a convent into which I had been forced
against my will.I told him I would pay him my passage to America, if
he would hide me somewhere until the ship was well out to sea.He said
I had come just in time, for he was only waiting for a fair wind, and
hoped to be off that evening."I have," said he, "a large number of
bread-casks on board, and two are empty.I shall have you put into one
of these, in which I shall make augur-holes, so that you can have plenty
of fresh air.Down in the hold amongst the provisions you will be safe."I thanked my kind friend and requested him to buy me some needles, silk,
and cotton thread, and some stuff for a couple of dresses, and one-piece
of fine cotton, so that I might make myself comfortable during the
voyage.After I ate my dinner, the men called the captain and said there were
several boats full of soldiers coming to the ship, accompanied by the
priests."Lady," exclaimed the captain, "they are after you.There is
not a moment to be lost.Smith, tell
the men to be careful and not make known that there is a lady on board."I followed my friend quickly, and soon
found myself coiled in a large cask.The captain coopered the head,
which was missing, and made holes for me to get the air; but the
perspiration ran off my face in a stream.Lots of things were piled on
the cask, so that I had hard work to breathe; but such was my fear
of the priests that I would rather have perished in the cask than be
returned to die by inches.The captain had been gone but a short time when I heard steps on deck,
and much noise and confusion.As the hatches were open, I could hear
very distinctly.After the whole company were on deck, the captain
invited the priests and friars, about twenty in number, to walk down to
the cabin, and explain the cause of their visit.They talked through an
interpreter, and said that "a woman of bad character had robbed one of
the churches of a large amount of gold, had attempted to murder one
of the holy priests, but they were happy to say that the holy father,
though badly wounded, was in a fair way of recovery.This woman is
young, but very desperate, has awful raving fits, and has recently
escaped from a lunatic institution.When her fits of madness come on
they are obliged to put her into a straight jacket, for she is the most
dangerous person in Italy.A great reward is offered for her by her
father and the government--five thousand scudi.Is not this enough to
tempt one to help find her?She was seen coming towards the shipping,
and we want the privilege of searching your ship.""Gentlemen," said the captain, "I do not know that the Italian
authorities have any right to search an American ship, under the stars
and stripes of the United States, for we do not allow even the greatest
naval power on earth to do that thing.But if such a mad and dangerous
woman as you have described should by any means have smuggled herself
on board my ship, you are quite welcome to take her away as soon as
possible, for I should be afraid of my life if I was within one hundred
yards of such an unfortunate creature.If you can get her into your
lunatic asylum, the quicker the better; and the five thousand scudi will
come in good time, for I am thinking of building me a larger ship on my
return home.Now, gentlemen, come; I will assist you, for I should like
to see the gold in my pocket."The captain opened all his closets and
secret places, in the cabin and forecastle and in the hold; everything
was searched, all but the identical bread-cask in which I was snugly
coiled.After something like half an hour's search, the soldiers of King
Ferdinand and the priests of King Pope left the ship, satisfied that the
crazy nun was not on board; for, judging the captain by themselves, they
thought he certainly would have given up a mad woman for the sake of
five thousand scudi in gold, and for the safety of his own peace and
comfort.A few moments after the Pope's friends had left, the excellent
benevolent captain came down, and speedily and gently knocking off a
few hoops with a hammer, took the head out, and I was free once more
to breathe God's free air.I lifted my trembling heart in thanksgiving,
while tears of gratitude rolled down my cheeks.Yet, as we were still
within the reach of the guns of the papal forts, my heart was by no
means at rest.But the good captain assured me repeatedly that
all danger was past, for he had twenty-five men on board, all true
Protestants, and he declared that all the priests of Naples would walk
over their dead bodies before they should reach his vessel a second
time."And besides," said the captain, "there are two American
men-of-war in port, who will stand up for the rights of Americans.They
have not yet forgotten Captain Ingraham, of the United States ship
St.Louis, and his rescue from the Austrian <DW7>s of the Hungarian
patriot, Martin Kozsta."The captain wisely refused to purchase any
needles or thread for me on shore, or any articles of ladies' dress,
for fear of the Jesuitical spies, who might surmise something and cause
further trouble.But he kindly furnished me with some goods he had
purchased for his own wife, and there were needles and silk enough on
board, so that I soon cut and made a few articles that made me very
comfortable during our voyage of thirty-two days to London.Early the next morning we sailed out of the beautiful harbor of Naples,
with a fair wind.The beautiful ship seemed to fly over the blue sea.I staid on deck gazing at my native city as long as I could.I thought
then of my once happy home, of my poor, broken-hearted mother, of my
unhappy father.Although he had cast me off through the foul play of
Jesuitical intrigue, my love for my dear father remained the same."Farewell, my dear Italy," I said to myself."When, my poor native land,
wilt thou be happy?Never, never, so long as the Pope lives, and his
wicked, murderous priests, to curse thee by their power."After we got out into the open sea, the motion of the ship made me feel
very sick, and I was so starved out before I came on board, that what
good provisions I ate on board did not seem to agree with me.My stomach
was in a very bad state, for while I was in the lower regions of the
convent I ate only a small quantity of very stale hard bread once in
twenty-four hours, at the ringing of the vesper bells every evening, and
the water given me was that in which the holy Mother Abbess had washed
her sacred feet.But I must give the holy mother credit for one good
omission--she did not use any soap.The captain gave me a good state-room which I occupied with an English
lady passenger.This good lady was accustomed to the sea, therefore, she
did not suffer any inconvenience from sea-sickness; but I was very sick,
so that I kept my berth for five days.This good Protestant lady was
very kind and attentive during the whole passage, and kindly assisted me
in getting my garments made up on board.On our arrival in London, the
captain said that he would sail for America in two weeks time, and very
kindly offered me a free passage to his happy, native land; and I could
not persuade him to take any money for my passage from Naples, nor for
the clothing he had given me.My fellow passenger being wealthy, and well acquainted with people in
England, took me to her splendid home, a few miles from London.At her
residence I was introduced to a young French gentleman, a member of the
Evangelical protestant church in France, and a descendant of the pious
persecuted Huguenots.This gentleman speaks good English and Italian,
having enjoyed the privilege of a superior education.His fervent
prayers at the family altar morning and evening made a very deep
impression on my mind.He became deeply interested in my history, and
offered to take me to France, after I should become his lawful wife.Though I did not like the idea of choosing another popish country for my
residence, yet as my friend assured me that I should enjoy my protestant
religion unmolested, I gave him my hand and my heart.My lady fellow
passenger was my bridesmaid.We were married by a good protestant
minister.My husband is a wealthy merchant--gives me means and
opportunities for doing good.Our
home is one of piety and peace and happiness.The blessed Bible is read
by us every day.Morning and evening we sing God's praise, and call upon
the name of the Lord.Our prayer is that God may deliver beloved France
and Italy from the curse of popery.Another proof of the persecuting spirit of Rome is furnished by the
"Narrative of Raffaele Ciocci, formerly a Benedictine Monk, but who now
'comes forth from Inquisitorial search and torture, and tells us what
he has seen, heard and felt.'"We can make but a few extracts from
this interesting little volume, published by the American and Foreign
Christian Union, who,--to use their own language--"send it forth as a
voice of instruction and warning to the American people.They are not to be set aside by an apology for the
dark ages, nor an appeal to the refinement of the nineteenth century.Here is Rome, not as she WAS in the midnight of the world, but as she
IS at the present moment.There is the same opposition to private
judgment--the same coercive measures--the same cruel persecution--the
same efforts to crush the civil and religious liberties of her own
subjects, for which she has ever been characterized."Ciocci, compelled at an early age to enter the Catholic College--forced,
notwithstanding his deep disgust and earnest remonstrance, to become a
monk--imprisoned--deceived--the victim of priestly artifice and fraud,
at length becomes a Christian.He is of course thrown into a deeper
dungeon; and more exquisite anguish inflicted upon him that he may be
constrained to return to the Romish faith.Of his imprisonment he says,
"We traversed long corridors till we arrived at the door of an apartment
which they requested me to enter, and they themselves retired.On
opening the door I found myself in a close dark room, barely large
enough for the little furniture it contained, which consisted of a small
hard bed, hard as the conscience of an inquisitor, a little table cut
all over, and a dirty ill-used chair.The window which was shut and
barred with iron resisted all my efforts to open it My heart sunk within
me, and I began to cogitate on the destiny in store for me."The Jesuit
Giuliani entering his room, he asked that the window might be opened
for the admission of light and air.Before the words were finished he
exclaimed in a voice of thunder, "How!wretched youth, thou complainest
of the dark, whilst thou art living in the clouds of error?Dost thou
desire the light of heaven, while thou rejectest the light of the
Catholic faith?"Ciocci saw that remonstrance was useless, but he reminded his jailer
that he had been sent there for three days, to receive instruction, not
to be treated as a criminal."For three days," he resumed, counterfeiting my tone of voice, "for
three days!The dainty youth will not forsooth,
be roughly treated; it remains to be seen whether he desires to be
courteously entertained.Fortunate is it for thee that thou art come to this place.THOU WILT
NEVER quit it excepting with the real fruits of repentance!Among these
silent shades canst thou meditate at thy leisure upon the deplorable
state into which thou hast fallen.Woe unto thee, if thou refusest to
listen to the voice of God, who conducts souls into solitude that he
may speak with them.""So saying," he continues, "he abruptly left me.I
remained alone drooping under the weight of a misfortune, which was the
more severe, because totally unexpected.I stood, I know not how long,
in the same position, but on recovering from this lethargy, my first
idea was of flight.Without giving a minute account of the manner
in which I passed my wearisome days and nights in this prison, let it
suffice to say that they were spent in listening to sermons preached to
me four times a day by the fathers Giuliani and Rossini, and in the most
gloomy reflections."In the mean time the miseries I endured were aggravated by the heat of
the season, the wretchedness of the chamber, scantiness of food, and the
rough severity of those by whom I was occasionally visited.Uncertainty
as to when this imprisonment would be at an end, almost drove me wild,
and the first words I addressed to those who approached me were, 'Have
the kindness to tell me when I shall be permitted to leave this place?'One replied, 'My son, think of hell.'I interrogated another; the answer
was, 'Think my son, how terrible is the death of the sinner!'I spoke
to a third, to a fourth, and one said to me, 'My son, what will be your
feeling, if, on the day of judgment you find yourself on the left hand
of God?'the other, 'Paradise, my son, Paradise!'No one gave me a
direct answer; their object appeared to be to mistify and confound me.After the first few days, I began to feel most severely the want of
a change of clothing.Accustomed to cleanliness, I found myself
constrained to wear soiled apparel.* * * For the want of a comb, my
hair became rough and entangled.After the fourth day my portion of food
was diminished; a sign, that they were pressing the siege, that it was
their intention to adopt both assault and blockade--to conquer me by
arms, or induce me to capitulate through hunger.I had been shut up in
this wretched place for thirteen days, when, one day, about noon, the
Father Mislei, the author of all my misery, entered my cell."At the sight of this man, resentment overcame every other
consideration, and I advanced towards him fully prepared to indulge my
feelings, when he, with his usual smile, expressed in bland words
his deep regret at having been the cause of my long detention in this
retreat.'Never could I have supposed,' said he, 'that my anxiety
for the salvation of your soul would have brought you into so much
tribulation.But rest assured the fault is not entirely mine.You have
yourself, in a great degree, by your useless obstinacy, been the cause
of your sufferings.Ah, well, we will yet remedy all.'Not feeling any
confidence in his assurance, I burst out into bitter invectives and
fierce words.He then renewed his protestations, and clothed them with
such a semblance of honesty and truth, that when he ended with this
tender conclusion, 'Be assured, my son, that I love you,' my anger
vanished.* * * I lost sight of the Jesuit, and thought I was addressing
a man, a being capable of sympathising in the distresses of others.'Ah,
well, father,' said I, 'I need some one on whom I can rely, some one
towards whom I can feel kindly; I will therefore place confidence in
your words.'"After some further conversation, Ciocci was asked if
he wished to leave that place.he replied, "what a
strange question!You might as well ask a condemned soul whether he
desires to escape from hell!"At these words the Jesuit started like a
goaded animal, and, forgetting his mission of deceiver, with, knit brows
and compressed lips, he allowed his ferocious soul for one moment
to appear; but, having grown old in deceit, he immediately had the
circumspection to give this movement of rage the appearance of religious
zeal, and exclaimed, "What comparisons are these?Are you not ashamed to
assume the language of the Atheist?By speaking in this way you clearly
manifest how little you deserve to leave this place.But since I have
told you that I love you, I will give you a proof of it by thinking no
more of those irreligious expressions; they shall be forgotten as though
they had never been spoken.Well, the Cardinal proposes to you an easy
way of returning to your monastery.""Here is
the way," said he, presenting me with a paper: "copy this with your
own hand; nothing more will be required of you.""I took the paper with
convulsive eagerness.It was a recantation of my faith, there condemned
as erroneous.* * * Upon reading this, I shuddered, and, starting to my
feet, in a solemn attitude and with a firm voice, exclaimed, 'Kill me,
if you please; my life is in your power; but never will I subscribe
to that iniquitous formulary.'The Jesuit, after laboring in vain
to persuade me to his wishes, went away in anger.I now momentarily
expected to be conducted to the torture.Whenever I was taken from my
room to the chapel, I feared lest some trap-door should open beneath
my feet, and therefore took great care to tread in the footsteps of the
Jesuit who preceded me.No one acquainted with the Inquisition will say
that my precaution was needless.My imagination was so filled with the
horrors of this place, that even in my short, interrupted, and feverish
dreams I beheld daggers and axes glittering around me; I heard the noise
of wheels, saw burning piles and heated irons, and woke in convulsive
terror, only to give myself up to gloomy reflections, inspired by the
reality of my situation, and the impressions left by these nocturnal
visions.What tears did I shed in those dreary moments!How innumerable
were the bitter wounds that lacerated my heart!My prayers seemed to me
unworthy to be received by a God of charity, because, notwithstanding
all my efforts to banish from my soul every feeling of resentment
towards my persecutors, hatred returned with redoubled power.I often
repeated the words of Christ, 'Father, forgive them, they know not what
they do;' but immediately a voice would answer, 'This prayer is not
intended for the Jesuits; they resemble not the crucifiers, who were
blind instruments of the rage of the Jews; while these men are fully
conscious of what they are doing; they are the modern Pharisees.'The
reading of the Bible would have afforded me great consolation, but this
was denied me."* * *

The fourteenth day of his imprisonment he was taken to the council
to hear his sentence, when he was again urged to sign the form of
recantation.The Father Rossini then spoke: "You are
decided; let it be, then, as you deserve.Rebellious son of the church,
in the fullness of the power which she has received from Christ, you
shall feel the holy rigor of her laws.She cannot permit tares to grow
with the good seed.She cannot suffer you to remain among her sons and
become the stumbling-block for the ruin of many.Abandon, therefore,
all hope of leaving this place, and of returning to dwell among the
faithful.KNOW, ALL IS FINISHED FOR YOU!"For the conclusion of this narrative we refer the reader to the volume
itself.If any more evidence were needed to show that the spirit of Romanism is
the same to-day that it has ever been, we find it in the account of
a legal prosecution against ten Christians at Beldac, in France,
for holding and attending a public worship not licensed by the civil
authority.They had made repeated, respectful, and earnest applications
to the prefect of the department of Hante-Vienne for the authorization
required by law, and which, in their case, ought to have been given.They persisted in rendering to God that worship
which his own command and their consciences required.For this they were
arraigned as above stated, on the 10th of August, 1855.On the 26th of
January, 1856, the case was decided by the "tribunal," and the three
pastors and one lady, a schoolmistress, were condemned to pay a fine
of one thousand francs each, and some of the others five-hundred francs
each, the whole amount, together with legal expenditures, exceeding the
sum of nine thousand francs.Meantime, the converts continue to hold their worship-meetings in the
woods, barns, and secret places, in order not to be surprised by the
police commissioner, and to avoid new official reports."Thus, you see," says V. De Pressense, in a letter to the 'American and
foreign Christian Union,' "that we are brought back to the religious
meetings of the desert, when the Protestants of the Cevennes evinced
such persevering fidelity.The only difference is, that these Christians
belonged only a short time ago to that church which is now instigating
persecutions against them."DESTRUCTION OF THE INQUISITION IN SPAIN.Lehmanowsky was attached to the part of Napoleon's army
which was stationed in Madrid.L., "I
used to speak freely among the people what I thought of the Priests
and Jesuits, and of the Inquisition.It had been decreed by the Emperor
Napoleon that the Inquisition and the Monasteries should be suppressed,
but the decree, he said, like some of the laws enacted in this country,
was not executed."Months had passed away, and the prisons of the Inquisition had not been
opened.One night, about ten or eleven o'clock, as he was walking one of
the streets of Madrid, two armed men sprang upon him from an alley, and
made a furious attack.He instantly drew his sword, put himself in a
posture of defence, and while struggling with them, he saw at a distance
the lights of the patrols,--French soldiers mounted, who carried
lanterns, and who rode through the streets of the city at all hours of
the night, to preserve order.He called to them in French, and as they
hastened to his assistance, the assailants took to their heels and
escaped; not, however, before he saw by their dress that they belonged
to the guards of the Inquisition.He went immediately to Marshal Soult, then Governor of Madrid, told him
what had taken place, and reminded him of the decree to suppress this
institution.Marshal Soult told him that he might go and suppress it The
Colonel said that his regiment (the 9th.of the Polish Lancers,) was not
sufficient for such a service, but if he would give him two additional
regiments, the 117th, and another which he named, he would undertake the
work.The 117th regiment was under the command of Col.De Lile, who
is now, like Col.L., a minister of the gospel, and pastor of an
evangelical church in Marseilles, France."The troops required were
granted, and I proceeded," said Col.L., "to the Inquisition which was
situated about five miles from the city.It was surrounded by a wall of
great strength, and defended by a company of soldiers.When we arrived
at the walls, I addressed one of the sentinels, and summoned the holy
fathers to surrender to the Imperial army, and open the gates of the
Inquisition.The sentinel who was standing on the wall, appeared to
enter into conversation with some one within, at the close of which he
presented his musket, and shot one of my men.This was the signal of
attack, and I ordered my troops to fire upon those who appeared on the
walls."It was soon obvious that it was an unequal warfare.The soldiers of the
holy office were partially protected by a breast-work upon the walls
which were covered with soldiers, while our troops were in the open
plain, and exposed to a destructive fire.We had no cannon, nor could
we scale the walls, and the gates successfully resisted all attempts at
forcing them.I could not retire and send for cannon to break through
the walls without giving them time to lay a train for blowing us up.I saw that it was necessary to change the mode of attack, and directed
some trees to be cut down and trimmed, to be used as battering rams.Two
of these were taken up by detachments of men, as numerous as could work
to advantage, and brought to bear upon the walls with all the power they
could exert, while the troops kept up a fire to protect them from the
fire poured upon them from the walls.Presently the walls began to
tremble, a breach was made, and the Imperial troops rushed into the
Inquisition.Here we met with an incident, which nothing but Jesuitical
effrontery is equal to.The Inquisitor General, followed by the father
confessors in their priestly robes, all came out of their rooms, as we
were making our way into the interior of the Inquisition, and with long
faces, and arms crossed over their breasts, their fingers resting on
their shoulders, as though they had been deaf to all the noise of
the attack and defence, and had just learned what was going on, they
addressed themselves in the language of rebuke to their own soldiers,
saying, "WHY DO YOU FIGHT OUR FRIENDS, THE FRENCH?"Their intention, no doubt, was to make us think that this defence was
wholly unauthorized by them, hoping, if they could make us believe
that they were friendly, they should have a better opportunity, in the
confusion of the moment, to escape.Their artifice was too shallow, and
did not succeed.I caused them to be placed under guard, and all
the soldiers of the Inquisition to be secured as prisoners.We then
proceeded to examine all the rooms of the stately edifice.We passed
through room after room; found all perfectly in order, richly furnished,
with altars and crucifixes, and wax candles in abundance, but we could
discover no evidences of iniquity being practiced there, nothing of
those peculiar features which we expected to find in an Inquisition.We found splendid paintings, and a rich and extensive library.Here was
beauty and splendor, and the most perfect order on which my eyes
had ever rested.The
ceilings and floors of wood were scoured and highly polished.The marble
floors were arranged with a strict regard to order.There was everything
to please the eye and gratify a cultivated taste; but where were those
horrid instruments of torture, of which we had been told, and where
those dungeons in which human beings were said to be buried alive?The holy father assured us that they had been
belied; that we had seen all; and I was prepared to give up the search,
convinced that this Inquisition was different from others of which I had
heard.De Idle was not so ready as myself to give up the search, and
said to me, "Colonel, you are commander to-day, and as you say, so it
must be; but if you will be advised by me, let this marble floor be
examined.Let water be brought and poured upon it, and we will watch
and see if there is any place through which it passes more freely than
others."I replied to him, "Do as you please, Colonel," and ordered
water to be brought accordingly.The slabs of marble were large and
beautifully polished.When the water had been poured over the floor,
much to the dissatisfaction of the inquisitors, a careful examination
was made of every seam in the floor, to see if the water passed through.De Lile exclaimed that he had found it.By the side of
one of these marble slabs the water passed through fast, as though
there was an opening beneath.All hands were now at work for further
discovery; the officers with their swords and the soldiers with their
bayonets, seeking to clear out the seam, and pry up the slab; others
with the butts of their muskets striking the slab with all their might
to break it, while the priests remonstrated against our desecrating
their holy and beautiful house.While thus engaged, a soldier, who was
striking with the butt of his musket, struck a spring, and the marble
slab flew up.Then the faces of the inquisitors grew pale as Belshazzar
when the hand writing appeared on the wall; they trembled all over;
beneath the marble slab, now partly up, there was a stair-case.I
stepped to the altar, and took from the candlestick one of the candles
four feet in length, which was burning that I might explore the room
below.As I was doing this, I was arrested by one of the inquisitors,
who laid his hand gently on my arm, and with a very demure and holy look
said "My son, you must not take those lights with your bloody hands they
are holy.""Well," said I, "I will take a holy thing to shed light
on iniquity; I will bear the responsibility."I took the candle, and
proceeded down the stair-case.As we reached the foot of the stairs
we entered a large room which was called the hall of judgment.In the
centre of it was a large block, and a chain fastened to it.On this they
were accustomed to place the accused, chained to his seat.On one side
of the room was an elevated seat called the Throne of Judgment.This,
the Inquisitor General occupied, and on either side were seats less
elevated, for the holy fathers when engaged in the solemn business of
the Holy Inquisition.From this room we proceeded to the right, and obtained access to small
cells extending the entire length of the edifice; and here such sights
were presented as we hoped never to see again.Three cells were places
of solitary confinement, where the wretched objects of inquisitorial
hate were confined year after year, till death released them from their
sufferings, and their bodies were suffered to remain until they were
entirely decayed, and the rooms had become fit for others to occupy.To prevent this being offensive to those who occupied the Inquisition,
there were flues or tubes extending to the open air, sufficiently
capacious to carry off the odor.In these cells we found the remains
of some who had paid the debt of nature: some of them had been dead
apparently but a short time, while of others nothing remained but their
bones, still chained to the floor of their dungeon.In others we found living sufferers of both sexes and of every age, from
three score years and ten down to fourteen or fifteen years--all naked
as they were born into the world!Here were old men
and aged women, who had been shut up for many years.Here, too, were the
middle aged, and the young man and the maiden of fourteen years old.The soldiers immediately went to work to release the captives from
their chains, and took from their knapsacks their overcoats and
other clothing, which they gave to cover their nakedness.They were
exceedingly anxious to bring them out to the light of day; but Col.L., aware of the danger, had food given them, and then brought them
gradually to the light, as they were able to bear it.L., to explore another room on the left.Here we found the instruments of torture, of every kind which the
ingenuity of men or devils could invent.L., here described four
of these horrid instruments.The first was a machine by which the victim
was confined, and then, beginning with the fingers, every joint in the
hands, arms and body, were broken or drawn one after another, until the
victim died.The second was a box, in which the head and neck of the
victim were so closely confined by a screw that he could not move in any
way.Over the box was a vessel, from which one drop of water a second,
fell upon the head of the victim;--every successive drop falling upon
precisely the same place on the head, suspended the circulation in a few
moments, and put the sufferer in the most excruciating agony.The third
was an infernal machine, laid horizontally, to which the victim was
bound; the machine then being placed between two beams, in which were
scores of knives so fixed that, by turning the machine with a crank, the
flesh of the sufferer was torn from his limbs, all in small pieces.The
fourth surpassed the others in fiendish ingenuity.Its exterior was
a beautiful woman, or large doll, richly dressed, with arms extended,
ready, to embrace its victim.Around her feet a semi-circle was drawn.The victim who passed over this fatal mark, touched a spring which
caused the diabolical engine to open; its arms clasped him, and a
thousand knives cut him into as many pieces in the deadly embrace.L., said that the sight of these engines of infernal cruelty kindled the
rage of the soldiers to fury.They declared that every inquisitor and
soldier of the inquisition should be put to the torture.They might have turned their
arms against him if he had attempted to arrest their work.The first they put to death in the machine for
breaking joints.The torture of the inquisitor put to death by the
dropping of water on his head was most excruciating.The poor man cried
out in agony to be taken from the fatal machine.The inquisitor general
was brought before the infernal engine called "The Virgin.""No" said they, "you have caused others to kiss her, and
now you must do it."They interlocked their bayonets so as to form large
forks, and with these pushed him over the deadly circle.The beautiful
image instantly prepared for the embrace, clasped him in its arms,
and he was cut into innumerable pieces.L. said, he witnessed the
torture of four of them--his heart sickened at the awful scene--and he
left the soldiers to wreak their vengeance on the last guilty inmate of
that prison-house of hell.In the mean time it was reported through Madrid that the prisons of the
Inquisition were broken open, and multitudes hastened to the fatal spot.And, Oh, what a meeting was there!About a
hundred who had been buried for many years were now restored to life.There were fathers who had found their long lost daughters; wives were
restored to their husbands, sisters to their brothers, parents to their
children; and there were some who could recognize no friend among the
multitude.The scene was such as no tongue can describe.L. caused the library, paintings,
furniture, etc., to be removed, and having sent to the city for a wagon
load of powder, he deposited a large quantity in the vaults beneath
the building, and placed a slow match in connection with it.All had
withdrawn to a distance, and in a few moments there was a most joyful
sight to thousands.The walls and turrets of the massive structure rose
majestically towards the heavens, impelled by the tremendous explosion,
and fell back to the earth an immense heap of ruins.Lehmanowsky of the destruction of the
inquisition in Spain.Was it then finally destroyed, never again to be
revived?Giacinto Achilli, D. D.
Surely, his statements in this respect can be relied upon, for he is
himself a convert from Romanism, and was formerly the "Head Professor of
Theology, and Vicar of the Master of the Sacred Apostolic Palace."He certainly had every opportunity to obtain correct information on the
subject, and in a book published by him in 1851, entitled "Dealings
with the Inquisition," we find, (page 71) the following startling
announcement."We are now in the middle of the nineteenth century, and
still the Inquisition is actually and potentially in existence.This
disgrace to humanity, whose entire history is a mass of atrocious
crimes, committed by the priests of the Church of Rome, in the name of
God and of His Christ, whose vicar and representative, the pope, the
head of the Inquisition, declares himself to be,--this abominable
institution is still in existence in Rome and in the Roman States."Again, (page 89) he says, "And this most infamous Inquisition, a hundred
times destroyed and as often renewed, still exists in Rome as in the
barbarous ages; the only difference being that the same iniquities are
at present practiced there with a little more secrecy and caution than
formerly, and this for the sake of prudence, that the Holy See may not
be subjected to the animadversions of the world at large."On page 82 of the same work we find the following language."I do not
propose to myself to speak of the Inquisition of times past, but of what
exists in Rome at the present moment; I shall therefore assert that the
laws of this institution being in no respect changed, neither can the
institution itself be said to have undergone any alteration.The present
race of priests who are now in power are too much afraid of the popular
indignation to let loose all their inquisitorial fury, which might even
occasion a revolt if they were not to restrain it; the whole world,
moreover, would cry out against them, a crusade would be raised against
the Inquisition, and, for a little temporary gratification, much power
would be endangered.This is the true reason why the severity of its
penalties is in some degree relaxed at the present time, but they still
remain unaltered in its code."Again on page 102, he says, "Are the torments which are employed at the
present day at the Inquisition all a fiction?It requires the impudence
of an inquisitor, or of the Archbishop of Westminister to deny their
existence.I have myself heard these evil-minded persons lament and
complain that their victims were treated with too much lenity.I inquired of the inquisitor of Spoleto.Thomas Aquinas says," answered he; "DEATH TO ALL THE
HERETICS.""Hand over, then, to one of these people, a person, however respectable;
give him up to one of the inquisitors, (he who quoted St.Thomas Aquinas
to me was made an Archbishop)--give up, I say, the present Archbishop of
Canterbury, an amiable and pious man, to one of these rabid inquisitors;
he must either deny his faith or be burned alive.Is not this the spirit that invariably actuates the
inquisitors?and not the inquisitors only, but all those who in any
way defile themselves with the inquisition, such as bishops and their
vicars, and all those who defend it, as the <DW7>s do.Wiseman, the Archbishop of Westminster according to the
pope's creation, the same who has had the assurance to censure me from
his pulpit, and to publish an infamous article in the Dublin Review, in
which he has raked together, as on a dunghill, every species of filth
from the sons of Ignatius Loyola; and there is no lie or calumny that he
has not made use of against me.Well, then, suppose I were to be handed
over to the tender mercy of Dr.Wiseman, and he had the full power to
dispose of me as he chose, without fear of losing his character in
the eyes of the nation to which, by parentage more than by merit, he
belongs, what do you imagine he would do with me?Should I not have to
undergo some death more terrible than ordinary?Would not a council be
held with the reverend fathers of the company of Loyola, the same who
have suggested the abominable calumnies above alluded to, in order
to invent some refined method of putting me out of the world?I feel
persuaded that if I were condemned by the Inquisition to be burned
alive, my calumniator would have great pleasure in building my funeral
pile, and setting fire to it with his own hands; or should strangulation
be preferred, that he would, with equal readiness, arrange the cord
around my neck; and all for the honor and glory of the Inquisition, of
which, according to his oath, he is a true and faithful servant."Achilli is the spirit of Romanism!Can we
doubt that it would lead to results as frightful as anything described
in the foregoing story?But let us listen to his further remarks on the present state of the
Inquisition.On page 75 he says, "What, then, is the Inquisition of the
nineteenth century?The same system of intolerance which prevailed in
the barbarous ages.That which raised the Crusade and roused all Europe
to arms at the voice of a monk [Footnote: Bernard of Chiaravalle.]and
of a hermit, [Footnote: Peter the Hermit.]That which--in the name of
a God of peace, manifested on earth by Christ, who, through love
for sinners, gave himself to be crucified--brought slaughter on the
Albigenses and the Waldenses; filled France with desolation, under
Domenico di Guzman; raised in Spain the funeral pile and the scaffold,
devastating the fair kingdoms of Granada and Castile, through the
assistance of those detestable monks, Raimond de Pennefort, Peter
Arbues, and Cardinal Forquemorda.That, which, to its eternal infamy,
registers in the annals of France the fatal 24th of August, and the 5th
of November in those of England."That same system which at this moment flourishes at Rome, which has
never yet been either worn out or modified, and which at this present
time, in the jargon of the priests, is called a "the holy, Roman,
universal, apostolic Inquisition.Holy, as the place where Christ was
crucified is holy; apostolic, because Judas Iscariot was the first
inquisitor; Roman and universal, because FROM ROME IT EXTENDS OVER ALL
THE WORLD.It is denied by some that the Inquisition which exists in
Rome as its centre, is extended throughout the world by means of the
missionaries.The Roman Inquisition and the Roman Propaganda are in
close connection with each other.Every bishop who is sent in partibus
infidelium, is an inquisitor charged to discover, through the means of
his missionaries, whatever is said or done by others in reference to
Rome, with the obligation to make his report secretly.The Apostolic
nuncios are all inquisitors, as are also the Apostolic vicars.Here,
then, we see the Roman Inquisition extending to the most remote
countries."Again this same writer informs us, (page 112,) that "the
principal object of the Inquisition is to possess themselves, by
every means in their power, of the secrets of every class of society.Consequently its agents (Jesuits and Missionaries,) enter the domestic
circle, observe every motion, listen to every conversation, and would,
if possible, become acquainted with the most hidden thoughts.It is in
fact, the police, not only of Rome, but of all Italy; INDEED, IT MAY BE
SAID OF THE WHOLE WORLD."Achilli are fully corroborated by the Rev.In a book published by him in 1852, entitled
"The Brand of Dominic," we find the following remarks in relation to the
Inquisition of the present time.The Roman Inquisition is, therefore,
acknowledged to have an infinite multitude of affairs constantly on
hand, which necessitates its assemblage thrice every week.Still there
are criminals, and criminal processes.The body of officials are still
maintained on established revenues of the holy office.So far from any
mitigation of severity or judicial improvement in the spirit of its
administration, the criminal has now no choice of an advocate; but one
person, and he a servant of the Inquisition, performs an idle ceremony,
under the name of advocacy, for the conviction of all.And let the
reader mark, that as there are bishops in partibus, so, in like manner,
there are inquisitors of the same class appointed in every country, and
chiefly, in Great Britain and the colonies, who are sworn to secrecy,
and of course communicate intelligence to this sacred congregation of
all that can be conceived capable of comprehension within the infinitude
of its affairs.We must, therefore, either believe that the court
of Rome is not in earnest, and that this apparatus of universal
jurisdiction is but a shadow,--an assumption which is contrary to all
experience,--or we must understand that the spies and familiars of the
Inquisition are listening at our doors, and intruding themselves on our
hearths.How they proceed, and what their brethren at Rome are doing,
events may tell; BUT WE MAY BE SURE THEY ARE NOT IDLE.They were not idle in Rome in 1825, when they rebuilt the prisons of
the Inquisition.They were not idle in 1842, when they imprisoned Dr.Achilli for heresy, as he assures us; nor was the captain, or some other
of the subalterns, who, acting in their name, took his watch from him
as he came out.They were not idle in 1843, when they renewed the old
edicts against the Jews.And all the world knows that the inquisitors on
their stations throughout the pontifical states, and the inquisitorial
agents in Italy, Germany, and Eastern Europe, were never more active
than during the last four years, and even at this moment, when every
political misdemeanor that is deemed offensive to the Pope, is,
constructively, a sin against the Inquisition, and visited with
punishment accordingly.A deliberative body, holding formal session
thrice every week, cannot be idle, and although it may please them to
deny that Dr.Achilli saw and examined a black book, containing the
praxis now in use, the criminal code of inquisitors in force at this
day,--as Archibald Bower had an abstract of such a book given him for
his use about one hundred and thirty years ago,--they cannot convince
me that I have not seen and handled, and used in the preparation of this
volume, the compendium of an unpublished Roman code of inquisitorial
regulations, given to the vicars of the inquisitor-general of Modena.They may be pleased to say that the mordacchia, or gag, of which Dr.Achilli speaks, as mentioned in that BLACK BOOK, is no longer used;
but that it is mentioned there, and might be used again is more than
credible to myself, after having seen that the "sacred congregation" has
fixed a rate of fees for the ordering, witnessing, and administration of
TORTURE.There was indeed, a talk of abolishing torture at Rome; but
we have reason to believe that the congregation will not drop the
mordacchia, inasmuch, as, instead of notifying any such reformation to
the courts of Europe, this congregation has kept silence.For although a
continuation of the bullary has just been published at Rome, containing
several decrees of this congregation, there is not one that announces
a fulfilment of this illusory promise,--a promise imagined by a
correspondent to French newspapers, but never given by the inquisitors
themselves.And as there is no proof that they have yet abstained from
torture, there is a large amount of circumstantial evidence that they
have delighted themselves in death.When public burnings
became inexpedient--as at Goa--did they not make provision for private
executions?For a third time at least the Roman prisons--I am not speaking of those
of the provinces--were broken open, in 1849, after the desertion of Pius
IX., and two prisoners were found there, an aged bishop and a nun.Many persons in Rome reported the event; but instead of copying what is
already before the public, I translate a letter addressed to me by P.
Alessandro Gavazzi, late chaplain-general of the Roman army, in reply
to a few questions which I had put to him.All who have heard his
statements may judge whether his account of facts be not marked with
every note of accuracy.They will believe that his power of oratory DOES
NOT betray him into random declamation.Under date of March 20th, 1852,
he writes thus:

"MY DEAR SIR,--In answering your questions concerning the palace of
Inquisition at Rome, I should say that I can give only a few superficial
and imperfect notes.So short was the time that it remained open to the
public, So great the crowd of persons that pressed to catch a sight of
it, and so intense the horror inspired by that accursed place, that I
could not obtain a more exact and particular impression."I found no instruments of torture, [Footnote: "The gag, the
thumb-screw, and many other instruments of severe torture could be
easily destroyed and others as easily procured.The non-appearance of
instruments is not enough to sustain the current belief that the use of
them is discontinued.So long as there is a secret prison, and while
all the existing standards of inquisitorial practice make torture
an ordinary expedient for extorting information, not even a bull,
prohibiting torture, would be sufficient to convince the world that
it has been discontinued.The practice of falsehood is enjoined on
inquisitors.How, then, could we believe a bull, or decree, if it were
put forth to-morrow, to release them from suspicion, or to screen them
from obloquy?It would not be entitled to belief."--Rev.for they were destroyed at the time of the first French invasion,
and because such instruments were not used afterwards by the modern
Inquisition.I did, however, find, in one of the prisons of the second
court, a furnace, and the remains of a woman's dress.I shall never be
able to believe that that furnace was placed there for the use of the
living, it not being in such a place, or of such a kind, as to be of
service to them.Everything, on the contrary, combines to persuade me
that it was made use of for horrible deaths, and to consume the remains
of the victims of inquisitorial executions.Another object of horror I
found between the great hall of judgment and the luxurious apartment of
the chief jailer (primo custode), the Dominican friar who presides over
this diabolical establishment.This was a deep trap or shaft opening
into the vaults under the Inquisition.As soon as the so-called criminal
had confessed his offence; the second keeper, who is always a Dominican
friar, sent him to the father commissary to receive a relaxation
[Footnote: "In Spain, RELAXATION is delivery to death.In the
established style of the Inquisition it has the same meaning.But in the
common language of Rome it means RELEASE.In the lips of the inquisitor,
therefore, if he used the word, it has one meaning, and another to the
ear of the prisoner."--Rev.With the
hope of pardon, the confessed culprit would go towards the apartment of
the holy inquisitor; but in the act of setting foot at its entrance,
the trap opened, and the world of the living heard no more of him.I
examined some of the earth found in the pit below this trap; it was a
compost of common earth, rottenness, ashes, and human hair, fetid to the
smell, and horrible to the sight and to the thought of the beholder."But where popular fury reached its highest pitch was in the vaults of
St.Pius V. I am anxious that you should note well that this pope was
canonized by the Roman church especially for his zeal against heretics.I will now describe to you the manner how, and the place where, those
vicars of Jesus Christ handled the living members of Jesus Christ, and
show you how they proceeded for their healing.You descend into the
vaults by very narrow stairs.A narrow corridor leads you to the
several cells, which, for smallness and stench, are a hundred times more
horrible than the dens of lions and tigers in the Colosseum.Wandering
in this labyrinth of most fearful prisons, that may be called 'graves
for the living,' I came to a cell full of skeletons without skulls,
buried in lime, and the skulls, detached from the bodies, had been
collected in a hamper by the first visitors.and why were they buried in that place and in that manner?I have heard
some popish priests trying to defend the Inquisition from the charge of
having condemned its victims to a secret death, say that the palace of
the Inquisition was built on a burial-ground, belonging anciently to a
hospital for pilgrims, and that the skeletons found were none other
than those of pilgrims who had died in that hospital.But everything
contradicts this papistical defence.Suppose that there had been a
cemetery there, it could not have had subterranean galleries and
cells, laid out with so great regularity; and even if there had been
such--against all probability--the remains of bodies would have been
removed on laying the foundation of the palace, to leave the space free
for the subterranean part of the Inquisition.Besides, it is contrary to
the use of common tombs to bury the dead by carrying them through a door
at the side; for the mouth of the sepulchre is always at the top.And
again, it has never been the custom in Italy to bury the dead singly in
quick lime; but, in time of plague, the dead bodies have been usually
laid in a grave until it was sufficiently full, and then quick lime has
been laid over them, to prevent pestilential exhalations, by hastening
the decomposition of the infected corpses.This custom was continued,
some years ago, in the cemeteries of Naples, and especially in the daily
burial of the poor.Therefore, the skeletons found in the Inquisition
of Rome could not belong to persons who had died a natural death in
a hospital; nor could any one, under such a supposition, explain the
mystery of all the bodies being buried in lime except the head.It
remains, then, beyond a doubt, that that subterranean vault contained
the victims of one of the many secret martyrdoms of the butcherly
tribunal.The following is the most probable opinion, if it be not
rather the history of a fact:

"The condemned were immersed in a bath of slaked lime, gradually filled
up to their necks.The lime by little and little enclosed the sufferers,
or walled them up alive.As the lime
rose higher and higher, the respiration became more and more painful,
because more difficult.So that what with the suffocation of the smoke,
and the anguish of the compressed breathing, they died in a manner most
horrible and desperate.Some time after their death the heads would
naturally separate from the bodies, and roll away into the hollows made
by the shrinking of the lime.Any other explanation of the feet that may
be attempted will be found improbable and unnatural.You may make what
use you please of these notes of mine, since I can warrant their
truth.I wish that writers, speaking of this infamous tribunal of the
Inquisition, would derive their information from pure history, unmingled
with romance; for so great and so many the historical atrocities of the
Inquisition, that they would more than suffice to arouse the detestation
of a thousand worlds.I know that the popish impostor-priests go about
saying that the Inquisition was never an ecclesiastical tribunal, but
a laic.But you will have shown the contrary in your work, and may also
add, in order quite to unmask these lying preachers, that the palace
of the Inquisition at Rome is under the shadow of the palace of the
Vatican; that the keepers are to this day, Dominican friars; and that
the prefect of the Inquisition at Rome is the Pope in person."I have the honor to be your affectionate Servant,

"ALESSANDRA GAVAZZI.""The Roman parliament decreed the erection of a pillar opposite the
palace of the Inquisition, to perpetuate the memory of the destruction
of that nest of abominations; but before that or any other monument
could be raised, the French army besieged and took the city, restored
the Pope, and with him the tribunal of the faith.Achilli thrown into one of its old prisons, on the 29th of July 1849,
but the violence of the people having made the building less adequate
to the purpose of safe keeping, he was transferred to the castle of
St.Angelo, which had often been employed for the custody of similar
delinquents, and there he lay in close confinement until the 9th of
January, 1850, when the French authorities, yielding to influential
representations from this country assisted him to escape in disguise as
a soldier, thus removing an occasion of scandal, but carefully leaving
the authority of the congregation of cardinals undisputed.Indeed
they first obtained the verbal sanction of the commissary, who saw it
expedient to let his victim go, and hush an outcry."Yet some have the hardihood to affirm that there is no longer any
Inquisition; and as the Inquisitors were instructed to suppress the
truth, to deny their knowledge of cases actually passing through their
hands, and to fabricate falsehoods for the sake of preserving the
SECRET, because the secret was absolutely necessary to the preservation
of their office, so do the Inquisitors in partibus falsify and illude
without the least scruple of conscience, in order to put the people of
this country off their guard."That the Inquisition really exists, is placed beyond a doubt by its
daily action as a visible institution at Rome.But if any one should
fancy that it was abolished after the release of Dr.Achilli, let him
hear a sentence contradictory, from a bull of the Pope himself, Pius IX,
a document that was dated at Rome, August 22, 1851, where the pontiff,
condemning the works of Professor Nuytz, of Turin, says, "after having
taken the advice of the doctors in theology and canon law, AFTER HAVING
COLLECTED THE SUFFRAGES OF OUR VENERABLE BROTHERS THE CARDINALS OF THE
CONGREGATION OF THE SUPREME AND UNIVERSAL INQUISITION."And so recently
as March, 1852, by letters of the Secretariate of State, he appointed
four cardinals to be "members of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy
Roman and Universal Inquisition;" giving incontrovertible evidence that
provision is made for attending to communications of Inquisitors in
partibus from all parts of the world.As the old cardinals die off,
their vacant seats are filled by others.The 'immortal legion' is
punctually recruited."After all, have we in Great Britain, Ireland and the colonies, and our
brethren of the foreign mission stations, any reason to apprehend harm
to, ourselves from the Inquisition as it is?In reply to this question,
let it be observed;

"1.That there are Inquisitors in partibus is not to be denied.That
letters of these Inquisitors are laid before the Roman Inquisition is
equally certain.Even in the time of Leo XII, when the church of
Rome was far less active in the British empire than it is now, some
particular case was always decided on Thursday, when the Pope, in his
character of universal Inquisitor, presided in the congregation.It
cannot be thought that now, in the height of its exultation, daring and
aggression, this congregation has fewer emissaries, or that they are
less active, or less communicative than they were at that time.We
also see that the number is constantly replenished.The cardinals Della
Genga-Sermattei; De Azevedo; Fornari; and Lucciardi have just been added
to it.Besides a cardinal in England, and a delegate in Ireland, there is
both in England and Ireland, a body of bishops, 'natural Inquisitors,'
as they are always acknowledged, and have often claimed to be; and these
natural Inquisitors are all sworn to keep the secret--the soul of the
Inquisition.Since, then, there are Inquisitors in partibus, appointed
to supply the lack of an avowed and stationary Inquisition, and since
the bishops are the very persons whom the court of Rome can best
command, as pledged for such a service, it is reasonable to suppose they
act in that capacity.Some of the proceedings of these bishops confirm the assurance that
there is now an Inquisition in activity in England.* * * The vigilance
exercised over families, also the intermeddling of priests with
education, both in families and schools, and with the innumerable
relations of civil society, can only be traced back to the Inquisitors
in partibus, whose peculiar duty, whether by help of confessors or
familiars, is to worm out every secret of affairs, private or public,
and to organize and conduct measures of repression or of punishment.Where the secular arm cannot be borrowed, and where offenders lie beyond
the reach of excommunication, irregular methods must be resorted to,
not rejecting any as too crafty or too violent.Discontented mobs, or
individual zealots are to be found or bought.What part the Inquisitors
in partibus play in Irish assassinations, or in the general mass of
murderous assaults that is perpetrated in the lower haunts of crime,
it is impossible to say.Under cover of confessional and Inquisitorial
secrets, spreads a broad field of action--a region of mystery--only
visible to the eye of God, and to those'most reverend and most eminent'
guardians of the papacy, who sit thrice every week, in the Minerva
and Vatican, and there manage the hidden springs of Inquisition on the
heretics, schismatics, and rebels, no less than on 'the faithful'
of realms.Who can calculate the extent of their power over those
'religious houses,' where so many of the inmates are but neophytes,
unfitted by British education for the intellectual and moral abnegation,
the surrender of mind and conscience, which monastic discipline
exacts?Yet they must be coerced into submission, and kept under penal
discipline.Who can tell how many of their own clergy are withdrawn
to Rome, and there delated, imprisoned, and left to perish, if not
'relaxed' to death, in punishment of heretical opinions or liberal
practices?We have heard of laymen, too, taken to Rome by force, or
decoyed thither under false pretences there to be punished by the
universal Inquisition; and whatever of incredibility may appear in some
tales of Inquisitorial abduction, the general fact that such abductions
have taken place, seems to be incontrovertible.And now that the
Inquisitors in partibus are distributed over Christendom, and that they
provide the Roman Inquisition with daily work from year's end to year's
end, is among the things most certain,--even the most careless of
Englishmen must acknowledge that we have all reason to apprehend much
evil from the Inquisition as it is.And no Christian can be aware of
this fact, without feeling himself more than ever bound to uphold
the cause of christianity, both at home and abroad, as the only
counteractive of so dire a curse, and the only remedy of so vast an
evil."E. A. Lawrence, writing of "Romanism at Rome," gives us the
following vivid description of the present state of the Roman Church."Next is seen at Rome the PROPAGANDA, the great missionary heart of the
whole masterly system.Noiselessly, by the multiform orders of monks and
nuns, as through so many veins and arteries, it sends out and receives
back its vital fluid.In its halls, the whole world is distinctly
mapped out, and the chief points of influence minutely marked.A kind of
telegraphic communication is established with the remotest stations in
South Africa and Siberia, and with almost every nook in our own land,
to which the myrmidons of Papal power look with the most of fear.It
is through means of this moral galvanic battery, set up in the Vatican,
that the Church of Rome has gained its power of UBIQUITY--has so well
nigh made itself OMNIPOTENT, as well as omnipresent."It is no mean or puny antagonist that strides across the path of a
free, spiritual and advancing Protestantism.And yet, with a simple
shepherd's sling, and the smooth stones gathered from Siloa's brook, God
will give it the victory."Once more let us look, and we shall find at Rome, still working in its
dark, malignant efficiency, the INQUISITION.Men are still made to pass
through fires of this Moloch.This is the grand defensive expedient of
the Papacy, and is the chief tribunal of the States.Its processes are
all as secret as the grave.Its cells are full of dead men's bones.They
call it the Asylum for the poor--a retreat for doubting and distressed
pilgrims, where they may have experience of the parental kindness of
their father the Pope, and their mother the church.Achilli had a trial of this beneficient discipline, when thrown
into the deep dungeon of St.And how many other poor victims of
this diabolical institution are at this moment pining in agony, heaven
knows."In America, we talk about Rome as having ceased to persecute.She holds to the principle as tenaciously as ever.Of the evil spirit of Protestantism she says, "This
kind goeth not out, but by fire."Hence she must hold both the principle and the power of persecution, of
compelling men to believe, or, if they doubt, of putting them to death
for their own good.Take from her this power and she bites the dust."It may perchance be said that the remarks of the Rev.William Rule,
quoted above, refer exclusively to the existing state of things is
England, Ireland, and the colonies.But who will dare to say, after a
careful investigation of the subject, that they do not apply with equal
force to these United States?Has America nothing to fear from the inquisitors--from the Jesuits?Is
it true that the "Inquisition still exists in Rome--that its code is
unchanged--that its emissaries are sent over all the world--that every
nuncio and bishop is an Inquisitor," and is it improbable that, even
now, torture rooms like those described in the foregoing story, may be
found in Roman Catholic establishments in this country?Yes, even here,
in Protestant, enlightened America!Have WE then nothing to fear from
Romanism?But a few days since a gentleman of learning and intelligence
when speaking of this subject, exclaimed, "What have we to do with the
Jesuits?The idea that we have aught
to fear from Romanism, is simply ridiculous!"In reply to this, allow
me to quote the language of the Rev.Manuel J. Gonsalves, leader of the
Madeira Exiles."The time will come when the American people will arise as one man, and
not only abolish the confessional, but will follow the example of many
of the European nations, who had no peace, or rest, till they banished
the Jesuits.These are the men, who bask in the sunbeams of popery, to
whom the pope has entrusted the vast interests of the king of Rome, in
this great Republic.Nine tenths of the Romish priests, now working hard
for their Master the pope, in this country, are full blooded Jesuits.The man of sin who is the head of the mystery of iniquity--through
the advice of the popish bishops now in this country, has selected
the Jesuitical order of priests, to carry on his great and gigantic
operations in the United States of America.Those Jesuits who
distinguish themselves the most in the destruction of Protestant Bible
religion, and who gain the largest number of protestant scholars for
popish schools and seminaries; who win most American converts to their
sect are offered great rewards in the shape of high offices in the
church.John Hughes, the Jesuit Bishop of the New York Romanists, was
rewarded by Pope Pius 9th, with an Archbishop's mitre, for his great,
zeal and success, in removing God's Holy Bible from thirty-eight public
schools in New York, and for procuring a papal school committee, to
examine every book in the hands of American children in the public
schools, that every passage of truth, in those books of history
unpalatable to the pope might be blotted out."Has America then nothing
to do with Romanism?But another gentleman exclaims, "What if Romanism be on the increase in
the United States!Is not their religion as dear to them, as ours is
to us?"M. J. Gonsalves would reply as follows."The
American people have been deceived, in believing THAT POPERY WAS A
RELIGION, not a very good one to be sure, but some kind of one.We might as well call the Archbishop of the
fallen angels, and his crew, a religious body of intelligent beings,
because they believe in an Almighty God, and tremble, as to call the man
of sin and his Jesuits, a body of religious saints.The tree is known
by its fruit, such as 'love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness,
goodness, meekness, faith, temperance, brotherly kindness;' and where
the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, Christian liberty, giving
to God and man their due unasked.Now we ask, what kind of fruit does
the tree of Popery bear, in any country, that it should claim homage,
and respect, as a good religion?"Such is the language of one who knew so well what popery was, that he
fled from it as from a hell upon earth.In his further remarks upon the horrors of convent life in the United
States, he fully confirms the statements in the foregoing narrative.He
says, "It is time that American gentlemen, who are so much occupied
in business, should think of the dangers of the confessional, and the
miseries endured by innocent, duped, American, imprisoned females in
this free country; and remember that these American ladies who have been
duped and enticed by Jesuitical intrigue and craft, into their female
convents, have no means of deliverance; they cannot write a letter to a
friend without the consent and inspection of the Mother Abbess, who
is always and invariably a female tyrant, a creature in the pay of the
Bishop, and dependent upon the Bishop for her despotic office of power.The poor, unfortunate, imprisoned American female has no means of
redress in her power.She cannot communicate her story of wrong and
suffering to any living being beyond the walls of her prison.She may
have a father, a mother, a dear brother, or a sister, who, if they knew
one-sixteenth part of her wrongs and sufferings, would fly at once to
see her and sympathize with her in her anguish.But the Jesuit confessor
attached to the prison is ever on the alert.Those ladies who appear the
most unhappy, and unreconciled to their prison, are compelled to attend
the confessional every day; and thus the artful Jesuit, by a thousand
cross questions, is made to understand perfectly the state of their
minds.The Lady Porter, or door-keeper and jailor, is always a creature
of the priest's, and a great favorite with the Mother Abbess.Should any
friends call to see an unhappy nun who is utterly unreconciled to her
fate, the Lady Porter is instructed to inform those relatives that the
dear nun they want to see so much, is so perfectly happy, and given up
to heavenly meditations, that she cannot be persuaded to see an earthly
relative.At the same time the Mother Abbess dismisses the relatives
with a very sorrowful countenance, and regrets very much, in appearance,
their disappointment.But the unhappy nun is never informed that her
friends or relatives have called to inquire after her welfare.How
amazing, that government should allow such prisons in the name of
religion!"CONVENT OF THE CAPUCHINS IN SANTIAGO

In a late number of "The American and Foreign Christian Union," we find
the following account of conventual life from a report of a Missionary
in Chile, South America."Now, my brother, let me give you an account related to me by a most
worthy English family, most of the members of which have grown up in the
country, confirmed also by common report, of the Convent of Capuchins,
in Santiago."The number of inmates is limited to thirty-two young ladies.The
admittance fee is $2000.When the nun enters she is dressed like a
bride, in the most costly material that wealth can command.There,
beside the altar of consecration, she devotes herself in the most
solemn, manner to a life of celibacy and mortification of the flesh
and spirit, with the deluded hope that her works will merit a brighter
mansion in the realms above."The forms of consecration being completed, she begins to cast off
her rich veil, costly vestments, all her splendid diamonds and
brilliants--which, in many instances, have cost, perhaps, from ten to
fifteen, or even twenty thousand dollars.Then her beautiful locks are
submitted to the tonsure; and to signify her deadness forever to the
world, she is clothed in a dress of coarse grey cloth, called serge, in
which she is to pass the miserable remnant of her days.The dark sombre
walls of her prison she can sever pass, and its iron-bound doors are
shut forever upon their new, youthful, and sensitive occupant.Rarely,
if ever, is she permitted to speak, and NEVER, NEVER, to see her friends
or The loved ones of home--to enjoy the embraces of a fond mother, or
devoted father, or the smiles of fraternal or sisterly affection.If
ever allowed to speak at all, it is through iron bars where she cannot
be seen, and in the presence of the abbess, to see that no complaint
escapes her lips.However much her bosom may swell with anxiety at the
sound of voices which were once music to her soul, and she may long to
pour out her cries and tears to those who once soothed every sorrow of
her heart; yet not a murmur must be uttered.The soul must suffer
its own sorrows solitary and alone, with none to sympathize, or grant
relief, and none to listen to its moans but the cold gloomy walls of her
tomb.No, no, not even the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that great alleviator
of all the sorrows of the heart, is allowed an entrance there.Besides being condemned to a meagre, insufficient
and unwholesome diet which they themselves must cook, the nuns are
not allowed to speak much with each other, except to say, 'Que morir
tenemos, 'we are to die,' or 'we must die,' and to reply, 'Ya los
sabemos,' 'we know it,' or 'already we know it'

"They pass most of their time in small lonely cells, where they sleep in
a narrow place dug out in the ground, in the shape of a coffin, without
bed of any kind, except a piece of coarse serge spread down; and their
daily dress is their only covering.'Tired
nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep, no more with his downy pinions
lights on his unsullied with a tear:' FOR EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY-FOUR
they are aroused by the bell to perform their 'Ave Maria's,' count their
rosaries, and such other blind devotions as may be imposed.Thus they
drag out a miserable existence, and when death calls the spirit to its
last account, the other nuns dig the grave with their own hands, within
the walls of the convent, and so perform the obsequies of their departed
sister."Thus, I have briefly given you not fiction!but a faithful narrative
of facts in regard to conventual life, and an establishment marked by
almost every form of sin, and yet making pretence of 'perfecting the
saints,' by the free and gentle influences of the gospel of Christ.What is done with the rich vestments and jewels?Where do the priests get all their brilliants to perform high mass
and adorn their processions?Where does all the hair of the saints come from, which is sold in
lockets for high prices as sure preventives of evil?Whose grave has been plundered to obtain RELICS to sell to the
ignorant.Where does the Romish Church obtain her SURPLUS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO
SELL TO THE needy, and not give it like our blessed Lord, 'without money
and without price?'Who is responsible for the FANATICISM that induces a young female
to incarcerate herself?Where is the authority in reason, in revelation, for such a life?"A young lady lately cast herself from the tower, and was dashed in
pieces, being led to do it, doubtless, in desperation.The convents of
this city, of the same order, require the same entrance fee, $2000.Of
course, none but the comparatively rich can avail themselves of this
perfection of godliness."Who will say that this mode of life has not been invented in order to
cut short life as rapidly as possible, that the $2000, with all the rich
diamonds upon initiation, may be repeated as frequently as possible?how true it is, that Romanism is the same merciless, cruel,
diabolical organisation, wherever it can fully develop itself, in
all lands.How truly is it denominated by the pen of inspiration the
'MYSTERY OF INIQUITY,' especially that part of it relating to these
secret institutions, and the whole order of the Jesuits."The editor of the "Christian Union", in his remarks on the above, says,
"Already the fair face of our country is disfigured by the existence
here and there of conventual establishments.At present they do not
show the hideous features which they, at least in some cases, assume in
countries where papal influence and authority are supreme.The genius of
our government and institutions necessarily exerts a restraining power,
which holds them from excesses to which, otherwise, they might run.But
they constitute a part of a system which is strongly at variance with
the interests of humanity, and merely wait the occurrence of favorable
circumstances to visit upon our land all the horrors which they have
inflicted elsewhere."How many conventual establishments there are now in the nation, few
Protestants, it is believed, know.And how many young females, guilty of
no crime against society, and condemned by no law of the land, are shut
up in their walls and doomed to a life which they did not anticipate
when entering them, a life which is more dreadful to them than death,
very few of the millions of our citizens conceive.The majority of our
people have slept over the whole subject, and the indifference thus
manifested has emboldened the priests to posh forward the extension
of the system, and the workmen are now busy in various places in
the construction of additional establishments.But such facts as are
revealed in this article, from the pen of our missionary, in connection
with things that are occurring around us, show that no time should be
lost in examining this whole subject of convents and monasteries, and in
legislating rightly about them."Again, when speaking of papal convents in the United States, the same
talented writer observes, "The time has fully come when Protestants
should lay aside their apathy and too long-cherished indifference in
respect to the movements of Rome in this land.It is time for them to
call to mind the testimony of their fathers, their bitter experiences
from the papal See, and to take effective measures to protect the
inheritance bequeathed to them, that they may hand it down to their
children free from corruption, as pure and as valuable as when they
received it.They should remember that Rome claims never to change, that
what she was in Europe when in the zenith of her power, she will be here
when fairly installed, and has ability to enforce her commands."Her numbers now on our soil, her nearly two thousand priests moving
about everywhere, her colleges and printing-presses, her schools and
convents, and enormous amounts of property held by her bishops, have
served as an occasion to draw out something of her spirit, and to show
that she is ARROGANT AND ABUSIVE TO THE EXTENT OF HER POWER."Scarcely a newspaper issues from her press, but is loaded with abuse of
Protestants and of their religion, and at every available point assaults
are made upon their institutions and laws; and Rome and her institutions
and interests are crowded into notice, and special privileges are loudly
clamored for."All Protestants, therefore, of every name, and of every religious and
political creed, we repeat it, who do not desire to ignore the past, and
to renounce all care or concern for the future, as to their children and
children's children, should lose no time in informing themselves of
the state of things around them in regard to the papacy and its
institutions.They should without delay devote their efforts and
influence to the protection of the country against those Popish
establishments and their usages which have been set up among us without
the authority of law, and under whose crushing weight some of the
nations of Europe have staggered and reeled for centuries, and have now
but little of their former power and glory remaining, and under which
Mexico, just upon our borders, has sunk manifestly beyond the power of
recovery."Let each individual seek to awaken an interest in this matter in
the mind of his neighbor.And if there be papal establishments in
the neighborhood under the names of'schools,''retreats','religions
communities,' or any other designation, which are at variance with, or
are not conformed to, the laws of the commonwealth in which they are
situated, let memorials be prepared and signed by the citizens, and
forwarded immediately to the legislature, praying that they may be
subjected to examination, and required to conform to the laws by which
all Protestant institutions of a public nature are governed."Let us exclude from our national territory all irresponsible
institutions.Let us seek to maintain a government of law, and insist
upon the equality of all classes before it."In closing these extracts, we beg leave to express ourselves in the
words of the Rev.Sunderland, of Washington city, in a sermon
delivered before the American and Foreign Christian Union, at its
anniversary in May, 1856."But new it is asked, 'Why all this tirade against Roman Catholics?'It is not against the unhappy millions that are
ground down under the iron heel of that enormous despotism.They are of
the common humanity, our brethren and kinsmen, according to the flesh.They need the same light instruction and salvation that we need.Like
ourselves they need the one God, the one mediator between God and man,
the man Christ Jesus; and from the heart we love and pity them.We would
grant them all the privileges which we claim to ourselves.We can have
no animosity towards them as men and candidates with ourselves for the
coming judgment.But it is the system under which they are born, and
live, and die, I repeat, which we denounce, and when we shall cease to
oppose it, then let our right hand forget her cunning, and our tongue
cleave to the roof of our mouth.What is it but a dark and terrible
power on earth before which so many horrible memories start up?Why,
sir, look at it!We drag the bones of the grim behemoth out to view, for
we would not have the world forget his ugliness nor the terror he has
inspired.'A tirade against Romanism,' is it?O sir, we remember
the persecutions of Justinian; we remember the days of the Spanish
Inquisition; we remember the reign of 'the Bloody Mary;' we remember
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes; we remember St.Bartholomew;
we remember the murdered Covenanters, Huguenots, and Piedmontese; we
remember the noble martyrs dying for the testimony of the faith along
the ancient Rhine; we remember the later wrath which pursued the
islanders of Madeira, till some of them sought refuge upon these
shores; we remember the Madiai, and we know how the beast ever seeks to
propagate his power, by force where he can, by deception where he must.And when we remember these things, we must protest against the further
vigor and prosperity of this grand Babylon of all.Take it, then, tirade
and all, for so ye must, ye ministers of Rome, sodden with the fumes of
that great deep of abominations!The voice of the Protestant shall never
be hushed; the spirit of Reformation shall never sleep.O, lands of
Farel and of Calvin, of Zwingle and of Luther!O countries where the
trumpet first sounded, marshalling the people to this fearful contest!We have heard the blast rolling still louder down the path of three
hundred years, and in our solid muster-march we come, the children
of the tenth generation.We come a growing phalanx, not with carnal
weapons, but with the armor of the gospel, and wielding the sword of
truth on the right hand and on the left, we say that ANTICHRIST MUST
FALL.Hear it, ye witnesses, and mark the word; by the majesty of the
coming kingdom of Jesus, and by the eternal purpose of Jehovah, THIS
ANTICHRIST MUST FALL."[Footnote 35: It is noted among the publications in the July

STERNE’S INFLUENCE IN GERMANY


Thus in manifold ways Sterne was introduced into German life and
letters.[1] He stood as a figure of benignant humanity, of lavish
sympathy with every earthly affliction, he became a guide and mentor,[2]
an awakener and consoler, and probably more than all, a sanction for
emotional expression.Not only in literature, but in the conduct of life
was Yorick judged a preceptor.The most important attempt to turn
Yorick’s teachings to practical service in modifying conduct in human
relationships was the introduction and use of the so-called
“Lorenzodosen.” The considerable popularity of this remarkable conceit
is tangible evidence of Sterne’s influence in Germany and stands in
striking contrast to the wavering enthusiasm, vigorous denunciation and
half-hearted acknowledgment which marked Sterne’s career in England.A century of criticism has disallowed Sterne’s claim as a prophet, but
unquestionably he received in Germany the honors which a foreign land
proverbially accords.To Johann Georg Jacobi, the author of the “Winterreise” and
“Sommerreise,” two well-known imitations of Sterne, the sentimental
world was indebted for this practical manner of expressing adherence to
a sentimental creed.[3] In the _Hamburgischer Correspondent_ he
published an open letter to Gleim, dated April 4, 1769, about the time
of the inception of the “Winterreise,” in which letter he relates at
considerable length the origin of the idea.[4] A few days before this
the author was reading to his brother, Fritz Jacobi, the philosopher,
novelist and friend of Goethe, and a number of ladies, from Sterne’s
Sentimental Journey the story of the poor Franciscan who begged alms of
Yorick.“We read,” says Jacobi, “how Yorick used this snuff-box to
invoke its former possessor’s gentle, patient spirit, and to keep his
own composed in the midst of life’s conflicts.The good Monk had died:
Yorick sat by his grave, took out the little snuff-box, plucked a few
nettles from the head of the grave, and wept.We looked at one another
in silence: each rejoiced to find tears in the others’ eyes; we honored
the death of the venerable old man Lorenzo and the good-hearted
Englishman.In our opinion, too, the Franciscan deserved more to be
canonized than all the saints of the calendar.Gentleness, contentedness
with the world, patience invincible, pardon for the errors of mankind,
these are the primary virtues he teaches his disciples.” The moment was
too precious not to be emphasized by something rememberable, perceptible
to the senses, and they all purchased for themselves horn snuff-boxes,
and had the words “Pater Lorenzo” written in golden letters on the
outside of the cover and “Yorick” within.Oath was taken for the sake of
Saint Lorenzo to give something to every Franciscan who might ask of
them, and further: “If anyone in our company should allow himself to be
carried away by anger, his friend holds out to him the snuff-box, and we
have too much feeling to withstand this reminder even in the greatest
violence of passion.” It is suggested also that the ladies, who use no
tobacco, should at least have such a snuff-box on their night-stands,
because to them belong in such a high degree those gentle feelings which
were to be associated with the article.This letter printed in the Hamburg paper was to explain the snuff-box,
which Jacobi had sent to Gleim a few days before, and the desire is also
expressed to spread the order.Jacobi goes on to say: “Perhaps in the future, I may have the pleasure
of meeting a stranger here and there who will hand me the horn snuff-box
with its golden letters.I shall embrace him as intimately as one Free
Mason does another after the sign has been given.what a joy it
would be to me, if I could introduce so precious a custom among my
fellow-townsmen.” A reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[5]
sharply condemns Jacobi for his conceit in printing publicly a letter
meant for his friend or friends, and, to judge from the words with which
Jacobi accompanies the abridged form of the letter in the later editions
it would seem that Jacobi himself was later ashamed of the whole affair.The idea, however, was warmly received, and among the teary, sentimental
enthusiasts the horn snuff-box soon became the fad.A few days after the
publication of this letter, Wittenberg,[6] the journalist in Hamburg,
writes to Jacobi (April 21) that many in Hamburg desire to possess these
snuff-boxes, and he adds: “A hundred or so are now being manufactured;
besides the name Lorenzo, the following legend is to appear on the
cover: Animae quales non candidiores terra tulit.” Wittenberg explains
that this Latin motto was a suggestion of his own, selfishly made,
for thereby he might win the opportunity of explaining it to the fair
ladies, and exacting kisses for the service.Wittenberg asserts that a
lady (Longo guesses a certain Johanna Friederike Behrens) was the first
to suggest the manufacture of the article at Hamburg.A second letter[7]
from Wittenberg to Jacobi four months later (August 21, 1769) announces
the sending of nine snuff-boxes to Jacobi, and the price is given as
one-half a reichsthaler.Jacobi himself says in his note to the later
edition that merchants made a speculation out of the fad, and that a
multitude of such boxes were sent out through all Germany, even to
Denmark and Livonia: “they were in every hand,” he says.Graf Solms had
such boxes made of tin with the name Jacobi inside.Both Martin and
Werner instance the request[8] of a Protestant vicar, Johann David Goll
in Trossingen, for a “Lorenzodose” with the promise to subscribe to the
oath of the order, and, though Protestant, to name the Catholic
Franciscan his brother.According to a spicy review[9] in the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[10] these snuff-boxes were sold in
Hamburg wrapped in a printed copy of Jacobi’s letter to Gleim, and the
reviewer adds, “like Grenough’s tooth-tincture in the directions for its
use.”[11] Nicolai in “Sebaldus Nothanker” refers to the Lorenzo cult
with evident ridicule.[12]

There were other efforts to make Yorick’s example an efficient power of
beneficent brotherliness.Kaufmann attempted to found a Lorenzo order of
the horn snuff-box.Düntzer, in his study of Kaufmann,[13] states that
this was only an effort on Kaufmann’s part to embrace a timely
opportunity to make himself prominent.This endeavor was made according
to Düntzer, during Kaufmann’s residence in Strassburg, which the
investigator assigns to the years 1774-75.Leuchsenring,[14] the
eccentric sentimentalist, who for a time belonged to the Darmstadt
circle and whom Goethe satirized in “Pater Brey,” cherished also for a
time the idea of founding an order of “Empfindsamkeit.”

In the literary remains of Johann Christ Hofmann[15] in Coburg was found
the “patent” of an order of “Sanftmuth und Versöhnung.” A “Lorenzodose”
was found with it marked XXVIII, and the seven rules of the order, dated
Coburg “im Ordens-Comtoir, den 10 August, 1769,” are merely a topical
enlargement and ordering of Jacobi’s original idea.Appell states that Jacobi explained through a friend that he knew
nothing of this order and had no share in its founding.Longo complains
that Appell does not give the source of his information, but Jacobi in
his note to the so-called “Stiftungs-Brief” in the edition of 1807
quotes the article in Schlichtegroll’s “Nekrolog” as his only knowledge
of this order, certainly implying his previous ignorance of its
existence.Somewhat akin to these attempts to incorporate Yorick’s ideas is the
fantastic laying out of the park at Marienwerder near Hanover, of which
Matthison writes in his “Vaterländische Besuche,”[16] and in a letter to
the Hofrath von Köpken in Magdeburg,[17] dated October 17, 1785.After a
sympathetic description of the secluded park, he tells how labyrinthine
paths lead to an eminence “where the unprepared stranger is surprised by
the sight of a cemetery.On the crosses there one reads beloved names
from Yorick’s Journey and Tristram Shandy.Father Lorenzo, Eliza, Maria
of Moulines, Corporal Trim, Uncle Toby and Yorick were gathered by a
poetic fancy to this graveyard.” The letter gives a similar description
and adds the epitaph on Trim’s monument, “Weed his grave clean, ye men
of goodness, for he was your brother,”[18] a quotation, which in its
fuller form, Matthison uses in a letter[19] to Bonstetten, Heidelberg,
February 7, 1794, in speaking of Böck the actor.It is impossible to
determine whose eccentric and tasteless enthusiasm is represented by
this mortuary arrangement.Louise von Ziegler, known in the Darmstadt circle as Lila, whom Merck
admired and, according to Caroline Flaschsland, “almost compared with
Yorick’s Maria,” was so sentimental that she had her grave made in her
garden, evidently for purposes of contemplation, and she led a lamb
about which ate and drank with her.Upon the death of this animal,
“a faithful dog” took its place.Thus was Maria of Moulines
remembered.[20]

It has already been noted that Yorick’s sympathy for the brute creation
found cordial response in Germany, such regard being accepted as a part
of his message.That the spread of such sentimental notions was not
confined to the printed word, but passed over into actual regulation of
conduct is admirably illustrated by an anecdote related in Wieland’s
_Teutscher Merkur_ in the January number for 1776, by a correspondent
who signs himself “S.” A friend was visiting him; they went to walk, and
the narrator having his gun with him shot with it two young doves.“What have the doves done to you?” he queries.“Nothing,” is the reply, “but they will taste good to you.” “But they
were alive,” interposed the friend, “and would have caressed
(geschnäbelt) one another,” and later he refuses to partake of the
doves.Connection with Yorick is established by the narrator himself:
“If my friend had not read Yorick’s story about the sparrow, he would
have had no rule of conduct here about shooting doves, and my doves
would have tasted better to him.” The influence of Yorick was, however,
quite possibly indirect through Jacobi as intermediary; for the latter
describes a sentimental family who refused to allow their doves to be
killed.The author of this letter, however, refers directly to Yorick,
to the very similar episode of the sparrows narrated in the continuation
of the Sentimental Journey, but an adventure original with the German
Bode.This is probably the source of Jacobi’s narrative.The other side of Yorick’s character, less comprehensible, less capable
of translation into tangibilities, was not disregarded.His humor and
whimsicality, though much less potent, were yet influential.Ramler said
in a letter to Gebler dated November 14, 1775, that everyone wished to
jest like Sterne,[21] and the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ (October
31, 1775), at almost precisely the same time, discourses at some length
on the then prevailing epidemic of whimsicality, showing that
shallowness beheld in the then existing interest in humor a
justification for all sorts of eccentric behavior and inconsistent
wilfulness.Naturally Sterne’s influence in the world of letters may be traced most
obviously in the slavish imitation of his style, his sentiment, his
whims,--this phase represented in general by now forgotten triflers; but
it also enters into the thought of the great minds in the fatherland and
becomes interwoven with their culture.Their own expressions of
indebtedness are here often available in assigning a measure of
relationship.And finally along certain general lines the German Yorick
exercised an influence over the way men thought and wanted to think.The direct imitations of Sterne are very numerous, a crowd of followers,
a motley procession of would-be Yoricks, set out on one expedition or
another.Musäus[22] in a review of certain sentimental meanderings in
the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_,[23] remarked that the increase of
such journeyings threatened to bring about a new epoch in the taste of
the time.He adds that the good Yorick presumably never anticipated
becoming the founder of a fashionable sect.Other
expressions of alarm or disapprobation might be cited.Through Sterne’s influence the account of travels became more personal,
less purely topographical, more volatile and merry, more subjective.[24]
Goethe in a passage in the “Campagne in Frankreich,” to which reference
is made later, acknowledges this impulse as derived from Yorick.Its
presence was felt even when there was no outward effort at sentimental
journeying.The suggestion that the record of a journey was personal and
tinged with humor was essential to its popularity.It was probably
purely an effort to make use of this appeal which led the author of
“Bemerkungen eines Reisenden durch Deutschland, Frankreich, England und
Holland,”[25] a work of purely practical observation, to place upon his
title-page the alluring lines from Gay: “Life is a jest and all things
shew it.I thought so once, but now I know it;” a promise of humorous
attitude which does not find fulfilment in the heavy volumes of purely
objective description which follow.Probably the first German book to bear the name Yorick in its title was
a short satirical sketch entitled, “Yorick und die Bibliothek der
elenden Scribenten, an Hrn.--” 1768, 8vo (Anspach),[26] which is linked
to the quite disgustingly scurrilous Antikriticus controversy.Attempts at whimsicality, imitations also of the Shandean gallery of
originals appear, and the more particularly Shandean style of narration
is adopted in the novels of the period which deal with middle-class
domestic life.Of books directly inspired by Sterne, or following more
or less slavishly his guidance, a considerable proportion has
undoubtedly been consigned to merited oblivion.In many cases it is
possible to determine from contemporary reviews the nature of the
individual product, and the probable extent of indebtedness to the
British model.If it were possible to find and examine them all with a
view to establishing extent of relationship, the identity of motifs,
the borrowing of thought and sentiment, such a work would give us little
more than we learn from consideration of representative examples.In the
following chapter the attempt will be made to treat a number of typical
products.Baker in his article on Sterne in Germany adopts the rather
hazardous expedient of judging merely by title and taking from Goedeke’s
“Grundriss,” works which suggests a dependence on Sterne.[27]

The early relation of several great men of letters to Sterne has been
already treated in connection with the gradual awakening of Germany to
the new force.Wieland was one of Sterne’s most ardent admirers, one of
his most intelligent interpreters; but since his relationship to Sterne
has been made the theme of special study,[28] there will be needed here
but a brief recapitulation with some additional comment.Especially in
the productions of the years 1768-1774 are the direct allusions to
Sterne and his works numerous, the adaptations of motifs frequent, and
imitation of literary style unmistakable.Behmer finds no demonstrable
evidence of Sterne’s influence in Wieland’s work prior to two poems of
the year 1768, “Endymions Traum” and “Chloe;” but in the works of the
years immediately following there is abundant evidence both in style and
in subject matter, in the fund of allusion and illustration, to
establish the author’s indebtedness to Sterne.Behmer analyzes from this
standpoint the following works: “Beiträge zur geheimen Geschichte des
menschlichen Verstandes und Herzens;” “Sokrates Mainomenos oder die
Dialogen des Diogenes von Sinope;” “Der neue Amadis;” “Der goldene
Spiegel;” “Geschichte des Philosophen Danischmende;” “Gedanken über eine
alte Aufschrift;” “Geschichte der Abderiten.”[29]

In these works, but in different measure in each, Behmer finds Sterne
copied stylistically, in the constant conversations about the worth of
the book, the comparative value of the different chapters and the
difficulty of managing the material, in the fashion of inconsequence in
unexplained beginnings and abrupt endings, in the heaping up of words of
similar meaning, or similar ending, and in the frequent digressions.Sterne also is held responsible for the manner of introducing the
immorally suggestive, for the introduction of learned quotations and
references to authorities, for the sport made of the learned professions
and the satire upon all kinds of pedantry and overwrought enthusiasm.Though the direct, demonstrable influence of Sterne upon Wieland’s
literary activity dies out gradually[30] and naturally, with the growth
of his own genius, his admiration for the English favorite abides with
him, passing on into succeeding periods of his development, as his
former enthusiasm for Richardson failed to do.[31] More than twenty
years later, when more sober days had stilled the first unbridled
outburst of sentimentalism, Wieland speaks yet of Sterne in terms of
unaltered devotion: in an article published in the _Merkur_,[32] Sterne
is called among all authors the one “from whom I would last part,”[33]
and the subject of the article itself is an indication of his concern
for the fate of Yorick among his fellow-countrymen.It is in the form of
an epistle to Herr.zu D., and is a vigorous protest against
heedless imitation of Sterne, representing chiefly the perils of such
endeavor and the bathos of the failure.Wieland includes in the letter
some “specimen passages from a novel in the style of Tristram Shandy,”
which he asserts were sent him by the author.The quotations are almost
flat burlesque in their impossible idiocy, and one can easily appreciate
Wieland’s despairing cry with which the article ends.A few words of comment upon Behmer’s work will be in place.He accepts
as genuine the two added volumes of the Sentimental Journey and the
Koran, though he admits that the former were published by a friend, not
“without additions of his own,” and he uses these volumes directly at
least in one instance in establishing his parallels, the rescue of the
naked woman from the fire in the third volume of the Journey, and the
similar rescue from the waters in the “Nachlass des Diogenes.”[34] That
Sterne had any connection with these volumes is improbable, and the
Koran is surely a pure fabrication.Behmer seeks in a few words to deny
the reproach cast upon Sterne that he had no understanding of the
beauties of nature, but Behmer is certainly claiming too much when he
speaks of the “Farbenprächtige Schilderungen der ihm ungewohnten
sonnenverklärten Landschaft,” which Sterne gives us “repeatedly” in the
Sentimental Journey, and he finds his most secure evidence for Yorick’s
“genuine and pure” feeling for nature in the oft-quoted passage
beginning, “I pity the man who can travel from Dan to Beersheba and cry
‘’Tis all barren.’” It would surely be difficult to find these repeated
instances, for, in the whole work, Sterne gives absolutely no
description of natural scenery beyond the most casual, incidental
reference: the familiar passage is also misinterpreted, it betrays no
appreciation of inanimate nature in itself, and is but a cry in
condemnation of those who fail to find exercise for their sympathetic
emotions.Sterne mentions the “sweet myrtle” and “melancholy
cypress,”[35] not as indicative of his own affection for nature, but as
exemplifying his own exceeding personal need of expenditure of human
sympathy, as indeed the very limit to which sensibility can go, when the
desert denies possibility of human intercourse.Sterne’s attitude is
much better illustrated at the beginning of the “Road to Versailles”:
“As there was nothing in this road, or rather nothing which I look for
in traveling, I cannot fill up the blank better than with a short
history of this self-same bird.” In other words, he met no possibility
for exercising the emotions.Behmer’s statement with reference to
Sterne, “that his authorship proceeds anyway from a parody of
Richardson,” is surely not demonstrable, nor that “this whole fashion of
composition is indeed but ridicule of Richardson.” Richardson’s star had
paled perceptibly before Sterne began to write, and the period of his
immense popularity lies nearly twenty years before.There is not the
slightest reason to suppose that his works have any connection
whatsoever with Richardson’s novels.One is tempted to think that Behmer
confuses Sterne with Fielding, whose career as a novelist did begin as a
parodist of the vain little printer.That the “Starling” in the
Sentimental Journey, which is passed on from hand to hand, and the
burden of government which wanders similarly in “Der Goldene Spiegel”
constitute a parallelism, as Behmer suggests (p.It could also be hardly demonstrated that what Behmer calls
“die Sternische Einführungsweise”[36] (p.54), as used in the
“Geschichte der Abderiten,” is peculiar to Sterne or even characteristic
of him.19) seems to be ignorant of any reprints or
translations of the Koran, the letters and the sermons, save those
coming from Switzerland.Bauer’s study of the Sterne-Wieland relation is much briefer
(thirty-five pages) and much less satisfactory because less thorough,
yet it contains some few valuable individual points and cited
parallelisms.Bauer errs in stating that Shandy appeared 1759-67 in
York, implying that the whole work was issued there.He gives the dates
of Sterne’s first visit to Paris, also incorrectly, as 1760-62.Finally, Wieland cannot be classed among the slavish imitators of
Yorick; he is too independent a thinker, too insistent a pedagogue to
allow himself to be led more than outwardly by the foreign model.He has
something of his own to say and is genuinely serious in a large portion
of his own philosophic speculations: hence, his connection with Sterne,
being largely stylistic and illustrative, may be designated as a drapery
of foreign humor about his own seriousness of theorizing.Wieland’s
Hellenic tendencies make the use of British humor all the more
incongruous.[37]

Herder’s early acquaintance with Sterne has been already treated.Subsequent writings offer also occasional indication of an abiding
admiration.Soon after his arrival in Paris he wrote to Hartknoch
praising Sterne’s characterization of the French people.[38] The fifth
“Wäldchen,” which is concerned with the laughable, contains reference to
Sterne.[39]

With Lessing the case is similar: a striking statement of personal
regard has been recorded, but Lessing’s literary work of the following
years does not betray a significant influence from Yorick.To be sure,
allusion is made to Sterne a few times in letters[40] and elsewhere,
but no direct manifestation of devotion is discoverable.The compelling
consciousness of his own message, his vigorous interest in deeper
problems of religion and philosophy, the then increasing worth of native
German literature, may well have overshadowed the influence of the
volatile Briton.Goethe’s expressions of admiration for Sterne and indebtedness to him
are familiar.Near the end of his life (December 16, 1828), when the
poet was interested in observing the history and sources of his own
culture, and was intent upon recording his own experience for the
edification and clarification of the people, he says in conversation
with Eckermann: “I am infinitely indebted to Shakespeare, Sterne and
Goldsmith.”[41] And a year later in a letter to Zelter,[42] (Weimar,
December 25, 1829), “The influence Goldsmith and Sterne exercised upon
me, just at the chief point of my development, cannot be estimated.This
high, benevolent irony, this just and comprehensive way of viewing
things, this gentleness to all opposition, this equanimity under every
change, and whatever else all the kindred virtues may be termed--such
things were a most admirable training for me, and surely, these are the
sentiments which in the end lead us back from all the mistaken paths of
life.”

In the same conversation with Eckermann from which the first quotation
is made, Goethe seems to defy the investigator who would endeavor to
define his indebtedness to Sterne, its nature and its measure.The
occasion was an attempt on the part of certain writers to determine the
authorship of certain distichs printed in both Schiller’s and Goethe’s
works.Upon a remark of Eckermann’s that this effort to hunt down a
man’s originality and to trace sources is very common in the literary
world, Goethe says: “Das ist sehr lächerlich, man könnte ebenso gut
einen wohlgenährten Mann nach den Ochsen, Schafen und Schweinen fragen,
die er gegessen und die ihm Kräfte gegeben.” An investigation such as
Goethe seems to warn us against here would be one of tremendous
difficulty, a theme for a separate work.It is purposed here to gather
only information with reference to Goethe’s expressed or implied
attitude toward Sterne, his opinion of the British master, and to note
certain connections between Goethe’s work and that of Sterne,
connections which are obvious or have been already a matter of comment
and discussion.In Strassburg under Herder’s[43] guidance, Goethe seems first to have
read the works of Sterne.His life in Frankfurt during the interval
between his two periods of university residence was not of a nature
calculated to increase his acquaintance with current literature, and his
studies did not lead to interest in literary novelty.This is his own
statement in “Dichtung und Wahrheit.”[44] That Herder’s enthusiasm for
Sterne was generous has already been shown by letters written in the few
years previous to his sojourn in Strassburg.Letters written to
Merck[45] (Strassburg, 1770-1771) would seem to show that then too
Sterne still stood high in his esteem.Whatever the exact time of
Goethe’s first acquaintance with Sterne, we know that he recommended the
British writer to Jung-Stilling for the latter’s cultivation in
letters.[46] Less than a year after Goethe’s departure from Strassburg,
we find him reading aloud to the Darmstadt circle the story of poor Le
Fevre from Tristram Shandy.This is reported in a letter, dated May 8,
1772, by Caroline Flachsland, Herder’s fiancée.[47] It is not evident
whether they read Sterne in the original or in the translation of
Zückert, the only one then available, unless possibly the reader gave a
translation as he read.Later in the same letter, Caroline mentions the
“Empfindsame Reisen,” possibly meaning Bode’s translation.She also
records reading Shakespeare in Wieland’s rendering, but as she speaks
later still of peeping into the English books which Herder had sent
Merck, it is a hazardous thing to reason from her mastery of English at
that time to the use of original or translation on the occasion of
Goethe’s reading.Contemporary criticism saw in the Martin of “Götz von Berlichingen”
a likeness to Sterne’s creations;[48] and in the other great work of the
pre-Weimarian period, in “Werther,” though no direct influence rewards
one’s search, one must acknowledge the presence of a mental and
emotional state to which Sterne was a contributor.Indeed Goethe himself
suggests this relationship.Speaking of “Werther” in the “Campagne in
Frankreich,”[49] he observes in a well-known passage that Werther did
not cause the disease, only exposed it, and that Yorick shared in
preparing the ground-work of sentimentalism on which “Werther” is built.According to the quarto edition of 1837, the first series of letters
from Switzerland dates from 1775, although they were not published till
1808, in the eleventh volume of the edition begun in 1806.Scherer,
in his “History of German Literature,” asserts that these letters are
written in imitation of Sterne, but it is difficult to see the occasion
for such a statement.The letters are, in spite of all haziness
concerning the time of their origin and Goethe’s exact purpose regarding
them,[50] a “fragment of Werther’s travels” and are confessedly cast in
a sentimental tone, which one might easily attribute to a Werther,
in whom hyperesthesia has not yet developed to delirium, an earlier
Werther.Yorick’s whim and sentiment are quite wanting, and the
sensuousness, especially as pertains to corporeal beauty, is distinctly
Goethean.Goethe’s accounts of his own travels are quite free from the Sterne
flavor; in fact he distinctly says that through the influence of the
Sentimental Journey all records of journeys had been mostly given up to
the feelings and opinions of the traveler, but that he, after his
Italian journey, had endeavored to keep himself objective.Robert Riemann in his study of Goethe’s novels,[52] calls Friedrich
in “Wilhelm Meister’s Lehrjahre” a representative of Sterne’s humor, and
he finds in Mittler in the “Wahlverwandtschaften” a union of seriousness
and the comic of caricature, reminiscent of Sterne and Hippel.Friedrich
is mercurial, petulant, utterly irresponsible, a creature of mirth and
laughter, subject to unreasoning fits of passion.One might, in thinking
of another character in fiction, designate Friedrich as faun-like.In
all of this one can, however, find little if any demonstrable likeness
to Sterne or Sterne’s creations.It is rather difficult also to see
wherein the character of Mittler is reminiscent of Sterne.Mittler is
introduced with the obvious purpose of representing certain opinions and
of aiding the development of the story by his insistence upon them.He
represents a brusque, practical kind of benevolence, and his
eccentricity lies only in the extraordinary occupation which he has
chosen for himself.Riemann also traces to Sterne, Fielding and their
German followers, Goethe’s occasional use of the direct appeal to the
reader.Doubtless Sterne’s example here was a force in extending this
rhetorical convention.It is claimed by Goebel[53] that Goethe’s “Homunculus,” suggested to the
master partly by reading of Paracelsus and partly by Sterne’s mediation,
is in some characteristics of his being dependent directly on Sterne’s
creation.In a meeting of the “Gesellschaft für deutsche Litteratur,”
November, 1896, Brandl expressed the opinion that Maria of Moulines was
a prototype of Mignon in “Wilhelm Meister.”[54]

The references to Sterne in Goethe’s works, in his letters and
conversations, are fairly numerous in the aggregate, but not especially
striking relatively.In the conversations with Eckermann there are
several other allusions besides those already mentioned.Goethe calls
Eckermann a second Shandy for suffering illness without calling a
physician, even as Walter Shandy failed to attend to the squeaking
door-hinge.[55] Eckermann himself draws on Sterne for illustrations in
Yorick’s description of Paris,[56] and on January 24, 1830, at a time
when we know that Goethe was re-reading Sterne, Eckermann refers to
Yorick’s (?)doctrine of the reasonable use of grief.[57] That Goethe
near the end of his life turned again to Sterne’s masterpiece is proved
by a letter to Zelter, October 5, 1830;[58] he adds here too that his
admiration has increased with the years, speaking particularly of
Sterne’s gay arraignment of pedantry and philistinism.But a few days
before this, October 1, 1830, in a conversation reported by Riemer,[59]
he expresses the same opinion and adds that Sterne was the first to
raise himself and us from pedantry and philistinism.By these remarks
Goethe commits himself in at least one respect to a favorable view of
Sterne’s influence on German letters.A few other minor allusions to
Sterne may be of interest.In an article in the _Horen_ (1795,
V. Stück,) entitled “Literarischer Sansculottismus,” Goethe mentions
Smelfungus as a type of growler.[60] In the “Wanderjahre”[61] there is a
reference to Yorick’s classification of travelers.Düntzer, in Schnorr’s
_Archiv_,[62] explains a passage in a letter of Goethe’s to Johanna
Fahlmer (August, 1775), “die Verworrenheiten des Diego und Juliens” as
an allusion to the “Intricacies of Diego and Julia” in Slawkenbergius’s
tale,[63] and to the traveler’s conversation with his beast.In a letter
to Frau von Stein[64] five years later (September 18, 1780) Goethe used
this same expression, and the editor of the letters avails himself of
Düntzer’s explanation.Düntzer further explains the word θεοδοκος,
used in Goethe’s Tagebuch with reference to the Duke, in connection with
the term θεοδιδακτος applied to Walter Shandy.The word is, however,
somewhat illegible in the manuscript.It was printed thus in the edition
of the Tagebuch published by Robert Keil, but when Düntzer himself, nine
years after the article in the _Archiv_, published an edition of the
Tagebücher he accepted a reading θεοτατος,[65] meaning, as he says, “ein
voller Gott,” thereby tacitly retracting his former theory of connection
with Sterne.The best known relationship between Goethe and Sterne is in connection
with the so-called plagiarisms in the appendix to the third volume of
the “Wanderjahre.” Here, in the second edition, were printed under the
title “Aus Makariens Archiv” various maxims and sentiments.Among these
were a number of sayings, reflections, axioms, which were later
discovered to have been taken bodily from the second part of the Koran,
the best known Sterne-forgery.Alfred Hédouin, in “Le Monde Maçonnique”
(1863), in an article “Goethe plagiaire de Sterne,” first located the
quotations.[66]

Mention has already been made of the account of Robert Springer, which
is probably the last published essay on the subject.It is entitled “Ist
Goethe ein Plagiarius Lorenz Sternes?” and is found in the volume
“Essays zur Kritik und Philosophie und zur Goethe-Litteratur.”[67]
Springer cites at some length the liberal opinions of Molière, La
Bruyère, Wieland, Heine and others concerning the literary appropriation
of another’s thought.He then proceeds to quote Goethe’s equally
generous views on the subject, and adds the uncritical fling that if
Goethe robbed Sterne, it was an honor to Sterne, a gain to his literary
fame.Near the end of his paper, Springer arrives at the question in
hand and states positively that these maxims, with their miscellaneous
companions, were never published by Goethe, but were found by the
editors of his literary remains among his miscellaneous papers, and then
issued in the ninth volume of the posthumous works.Hédouin had
suggested this possible explanation.Springer adds that the editors were
unaware of the source of this material and supposed it to be original
with Goethe.The facts of the case are, however, as follows: “Wilhelm Meister’s
Wanderjahre” was published first in 1821.[68] In 1829, a new and revised
edition was issued in the “Ausgabe letzter Hand.” Eckermann in his
conversations with Goethe[69] relates the circumstances under which the
appendices were added to the earlier work.When the book was in press,
the publisher discovered that of the three volumes planned, the last two
were going to be too thin, and begged for more material to fill out
their scantiness.In this perplexity Goethe brought to Eckermann two
packets of miscellaneous notes to be edited and added to those two
slender volumes.In this way arose the collection of sayings, scraps and
quotations “Im Sinne der Wanderer” and “Aus Makariens Archiv.” It was
later agreed that Eckermann, when Goethe’s literary remains should be
published, should place the matter elsewhere, ordered into logical
divisions of thought.All of the sentences here under special
consideration were published in the twenty-third volume of the “Ausgabe
letzter Hand,” which is dated 1830,[70] and are to be found there, on
pages 271-275 and 278-281.They are reprinted in the identical order in
the ninth volume of the “Nachgelassene Werke,” which also bore the
title, Vol.XLIX of “Ausgabe letzter Hand,” there found on pages 121-125
and 127-131.Evidently Springer found them here in the posthumous works,
and did not look for them in the previous volume, which was published
two years or thereabouts before Goethe’s death.Of the sentiments, sentences and quotations dealing with Sterne, there
are twenty which are translations from the Koran, in Loeper’s edition of
“Sprüche in Prosa,”[71] Nos.491-507 and 543-544; seventeen others (Nos.490, 508-509, 521-533, 535) contain direct appreciative criticism of
Sterne; No.538 is a comment upon a Latin quotation in the Koran and No.545 is a translation of another quotation in the same work.532
gives a quotation from Sterne, “Ich habe mein Elend nicht wie ein weiser
Mann benutzt,” which Loeper says he has been unable to find in any of
Sterne’s works.It is, however, in a letter[72] to John Hall Stevenson,
written probably in August, 1761.Loeper did not succeed in finding Nos.534, 536, 537, although their
position indicates that they were quotations from Sterne, but No.534 is
in a letter to Garrick from Paris, March 19, 1762.The German
translation however conveys a different impression from the original
English.The other two are not located; in spite of their position, the
way in which the book was put together would certainly allow for the
possibility of extraneous material creeping in.At their first
appearance in the “Ausgabe letzter Hand,” five Sprüche, Nos.491, 543,
534, 536, 537, were supplied with quotation marks, though the source was
not indicated.Thus it is seen that the most of the quotations were
published as original during Goethe’s lifetime, but he probably never
considered it of sufficient consequence to disavow their authorship in
public.It is quite possible that the way in which they were forced into
“Wilhelm Meister” was distasteful to him afterwards, and he did not care
to call attention to them.Goethe’s opinion of Sterne as expressed in the sentiments which
accompany the quotations from the Koran is significant.“Yorick Sterne,”
he says, “war der schönste Geist, der je gewirkt hat; wer ihn liest,
fühlet sich sogleich frei und schön; sein Humor ist unnachahmlich, und
nicht jeder Humor befreit die Seele” (490).“Sagacität und Penetration
sind bei ihm grenzenlos” (528).Goethe asserts here that every person of
culture should at that very time read Sterne’s works, so that the
nineteenth century might learn “what we owed him and perceive what we
might owe him.” Goethe took Sterne’s narrative of his journey as a
representation of an actual trip, or else he is speaking of Sterne’s
letters in the following:

“Seine Heiterkeit, Genügsamkeit, Duldsamkeit auf der Reise, wo diese
Eigenschaften am meisten geprüft werden, finden nicht leicht
Ihresgleichen” (No.529), and Goethe’s opinion of Sterne’s indecency is
characteristic of Goethe’s attitude.He says: “Das Element der
Lüsternheit, in dem er sich so zierlich und sinnig benimmt, würde vielen
Andern zum Verderben gereichen.”

The juxtaposition of these quotations and this appreciation of Sterne is
proof sufficient that Goethe considered Sterne the author of the Koran
at the time when the notes were made.At precisely what time this
occurred it is now impossible to determine, but the drift of the
comment, combined with our knowledge from sources already mentioned,
that Goethe turned again to Sterne in the latter years of his life,
would indicate that the quotations were made in the latter part of the
twenties, and that the re-reading of Sterne included the Koran.Since
the translations which Goethe gives are not identical with those in the
rendering ascribed to Bode (1778), Loeper suggests Goethe himself as the
translator of the individual quotations.Loeper is ignorant of the
earlier translation of Gellius, which Goethe may have used.[73]

There is yet another possibility of connection between Goethe and the
Koran.This work contained the story of the Graf von Gleichen, which is
acknowledged to have been a precursor of Goethe’s “Stella.” Düntzer in
his “Erläuterungen zu den deutschen Klassikern” says it is impossible to
determine whence Goethe took the story for “Stella.” He mentions that it
was contained in Bayle’s Dictionary, which is known to have been in
Goethe’s father’s library, and two other books, both dating from the
sixteenth century, are noted as possible sources.It seems rather more
probable that Goethe found the story in the Koran, which was published
but a few years before “Stella” was written and translated but a year
later, 1771, that is, but four years, or even less, before the
appearance of “Stella” (1775).[74]

Precisely in the spirit of the opinions quoted above is the little
essay[75] on Sterne which was published in the sixth volume of “Ueber
Kunst und Alterthum,” in which Goethe designates Sterne as a man “who
first stimulated and propagated the great epoch of purer knowledge of
humanity, noble toleration and tender love, in the second half of the
last century.” Goethe further calls attenion to Sterne’s disclosure of
human peculiarities (Eigenheiten), and the importance and interest of
these native, governing idiosyncrasies.A thorough
consideration of these problems, especially as concerns the cultural
indebtedness of Goethe to the English master would be a task demanding a
separate work.Goethe was an assimilator and summed up in himself the
spirit of a century, the attitude of predecessors and contemporaries.C. F. D. Schubart wrote a poem entitled “Yorick,”[76] beginning

  “Als Yorik starb, da flog
  Sein Seelchen auf den Himmel
  So leicht wie ein Seufzerchen.”

The angels ask him for news of earth, and the greater part of the poem
is occupied with his account of human fate.The relation is quite
characteristic of Schubart in its gruesomeness, its insistence upon
all-surrounding death and dissolution; but it contains no suggestion of
Sterne’s manner, or point of view.The only explanation of association
between the poem and its title is that Schubart shared the one-sided
German estimate of Sterne’s character and hence represented him as a
sympathetic messenger bringing to heaven on his death some tidings of
human weakness.In certain other manifestations, relatively subordinate, the German
literature of the latter part of the eighteenth century and the
beginning of the nineteenth and the life embodied therein are different
from what they would have been had it not been for Sterne’s example.Some of these secondary fruits of the Sterne cult have been mentioned
incidentally and exemplified in the foregoing pages.It would perhaps be
conducive to definiteness to gather them here.Sterne’s incontinuity of narration, the purposeful irrelation of parts,
the use of anecdote and episode, which to the stumbling reader reduce
his books to collections of disconnected essays and instances, gave to
German mediocrity a sanction to publish a mass of multifarious,
unrelated, and nondescript thought and incident.It is to be noted that
the spurious books such as the Koran, which Germany never clearly
sundered from the original, were direct examples in England of such
disjointed, patchwork books.Such a volume with a significant title is
“Mein Kontingent zur Modelectüre.”[77] Further, eccentricity in
typography, in outward form, may be largely attributed to Sterne’s
influence, although in individual cases no direct connection is
traceable.Thus, to the vagaries of Shandy is due probably the license
of the author of “Karl Blumenberg, eine tragisch-komische
Geschichte,”[78] who fills half pages with dashes and whole lines with
“Ha!Ha!”

As has been suggested already, Sterne’s example was potent in fostering
the use of such stylistic peculiarities, as the direct appeal to, and
conversation with the reader about the work, and its progress, and the
various features of the situation.It was in use by Sterne’s
predecessors in England and by their followers in Germany, before Sterne
can be said to have exercised any influence; for example, Hermes uses
the device constantly in “Miss Fanny Wilkes,” but Sterne undoubtedly
contributed largely to its popularity.One may perhaps trace to Sterne’s
blank pages and similar vagaries the eccentricity of the author of
“Ueber die Moralische Schönheit und Philosophie des Lebens,”[79] whose
eighth chapter is titled “Vom Stolz, eine Erzählung,” this title
occupying one page; the next page (210) is blank; the following page is
adorned with an urnlike decoration beneath which we read, “Es war einmal
ein Priester.” These three pages complete the chapter.The author of
“Dorset und Julie” (Leipzig, 1773-4) is also guilty of similar Yorickian
follies.[80]

Sterne’s ideas found approbation and currency apart from his general
message of the sentimental and humorous attitude toward the world and
its course.For example, the hobby-horse theory was warmly received, and
it became a permanent figure in Germany, often, and especially at first,
with playful reminder of Yorick’s use of the term.[81] Yorick’s
mock-scientific division of travelers seems to have met with especial
approval, and evidently became a part of conversational, and epistolary
commonplace allusion.Goethe in a letter to Marianne Willemer, November
9, 1830,[82] with direct reference to Sterne proposes for his son, then
traveling in Italy, the additional designation of the “bold” or
“complete” traveler.Carl August in a letter to Knebel,[83] dated
December 26, 1785, makes quite extended allusion to the classification.Lessing writes to Mendelssohn December 12, 1780: “The traveler whom you
sent to me a while ago was an inquisitive traveler.The one with whom I
now answer is an emigrating one.” The passage which follows is an
apology for thus adding to Yorick’s list.The two travelers were
respectively one Fliess and Alexander Daveson.[84] Nicolai makes similar
allusion to the “curious” traveler of Sterne’s classification near the
beginning of his “Beschreibung einer Reise durch Deutschland und die
Schweiz im Jahre 1781.”[85]

Further search would increase the number of such allusions indefinitely.A few will be mentioned in the following chapter.One of Walter Shandy’s favorite contentions was the fortuitous
dependence of great events upon insignificant details.In his
philosophy, trifles were the determining factors of existence.The
adoption of this theory in Germany, as a principle in developing events
or character in fiction, is unquestionable in Wezel’s “Tobias Knaut,”
and elsewhere.The narrative, “Die Grosse Begebenheit aus kleinen
Ursachen” in the second volume of the _Erholungen_,[86] represents a
wholesale appropriation of the idea,--to be sure not new in Shandy, but
most strikingly exemplified there.In “Sebaldus Nothanker” the Revelation of St.John is a Sterne-like
hobby-horse and is so regarded by a reviewer in the _Magazin der
deutschen Critik_.[87] Schottenius in Knigge’s “Reise nach Braunschweig”
rides his hobby in the shape of his fifty-seven sermons.[88] Lessing
uses the Steckenpferd in a letter to Mendelssohn, November 5, 1768
(Lachmann edition, XII, p.212), and numerous other examples of direct
or indirect allusion might be cited.Sterne’s worn-out coin was a simile
adopted and felt to be pointed.[89]

Jacob Minor in a suggestive article in _Euphorion_,[90] entitled
“Wahrheit und Lüge auf dem Theater und in der Literatur,” expressed the
opinion that Sterne was instrumental in sharpening powers of observation
with reference to self-deception in little things, to all the deceiving
impulses of the human soul.It is held that through Sterne’s inspiration
Wieland and Goethe were rendered zealous to combat false ideals and
life-lies in greater things.It is maintained that Tieck also was
schooled in Sterne, and, by means of powers of observation sharpened in
this way, was enabled to portray the conscious or unconscious life-lie.[Footnote 1: A writer in the _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen_, 1775
    (II, 787 ff.), asserts that Sterne’s works are the favorite
    reading of the German nation.][Footnote 2: A further illustration may be found in the following
    discourse: “Von einigen Hindernissen des akademischen Fleisses.Eine Rede bey dem Anfange der öffentlichen Vorlesungen gehalten,”
    von J. C. C. Ferber, Professor zu Helmstädt (1773, 8vo), reviewed
    in _Magazin der deutschen Critik_, III, St.This
    academic guide of youth speaks of Sterne in the following words:
    “Wie tief dringt dieser Philosoph in die verborgensten Gänge des
    menschlichen Herzens, wie richtig entdeckt er die geheimsten
    Federn der Handlungen, wie entlarvt, wie verabscheuungsvoll steht
    vor ihm das Laster, wie liebenswürdig die Tugend!wie interessant
    sind seine Schilderungen, wie eindringend seine Lehren!und woher
    diese grosse Kenntniss des Menschen, woher diese getreue
    Bezeichnung der Natur, diese sanften Empfindungen, die seine
    geistvolle Sprache hervorbringt?Dieser Saame der Tugend, den er
    mit wohlthätiger Hand ausstreuet?” Yorick held up to college or
    university students as a champion of virtue is certainly an
    extraordinary spectacle.A critic in the _Frankfurter Gel.Anz._,
    August 18, 1772, in criticising the make-up of a so-called
    “Landbibliothek,” recommends books “die geschickt sind, die guten
    einfältigen, ungekünstelten Empfindungen reiner Seelen zu
    unterhalten, einen Yorick vor allen . . ..” The long article on
    Sterne’s character in the _Götting.84-92, 1780,
    “Etwas über Sterne: Schreiben an Prof.Lichtenberg” undoubtedly
    helped to establish this opinion of Sterne authoritatively.In it
    Sterne’s weaknesses are acknowledged, but the tendency is to
    emphasize the tender, sympathetic side of his character.The
    conception of Yorick there presented is quite different from the
    one held by Lichtenberg himself.][Footnote 3: The story of the “Lorenzodosen” is given quite fully
    in Longo’s monograph, “Laurence Sterne und Johann Georg Jacobi”
    (Wien, 1898, pp.39-44), and the sketch given here is based upon
    his investigation, with consultation of the sources there cited.Nothing new is likely to be added to his account, but because of
    its important illustrative bearing on the whole story of Sterne in
    Germany, a fairly complete account is given here.Longo refers to
    the following as literature on the subject:

    “Sanftmuth und Toleranz, der eine dreyeckigte Lorenzodose zum

    their day, are not given by Goedeke; and Baker, judging only by
    one external, naturally misses Sterne products which have no
    distinctively imitative title, and includes others which have no
    connection with Sterne.For example, he gives Gellius’s “Yoricks
    Nachgelassene Werke,” which is but a translation of the Koran,
    and hence in no way an example of German imitation; he gives also
    Schummel’s “Fritzens Reise nach Dessau” (1776) and “Reise nach
    Schlesien” (1792), Nonne’s “Amors Reisen nach Fockzana zum
    Friedenscongress” (1773), none of which has anything to do with
    Sterne.“Trim oder der Sieg der Liebe über die Philosophie”
    (Leipzig, 1776), by Ludw.v. Hopffgarten, also cited by
    Baker, undoubtedly owes its name only to Sterne.See _Jenaische
    Zeitungen von gel.deutsche
    Bibl._, XXXIV, 2, p.484; similarly “Lottchens Reise ins
    Zuchthaus” by Kirtsten, 1777, is given in Baker’s list, but the
    work “Reise” is evidently used here only in a figurative sense,
    the story being but the relation of character deterioration,
    a downward journey toward the titular place of punishment.See
    _Jenaische Zeitungen von gel.; 1778,
    p. 12.deutsche Bibl._, XXXV, 1, p. 182.Baker gives Bock’s
    “Tagereise” and “Geschichte eines empfundenen Tages” as if they
    were two different books.He further states: “Sterne is the parent
    of a long list of German Sentimental Journeys which began with von
    Thümmel’s ‘Reise in die mittäglichen Provinzen Frankreichs.’” This
    work really belongs comparatively late in the story of imitations.Two of Knigge’s books are also included.[Footnote 28: “Laurence Sterne und C. M. Wieland, von Karl August
    Behmer, Forschungen zur neueren Litteraturgeschichte IX.München,
    1899.Ein Beitrag zur Erforschung fremder Einflüsse auf Wieland’s
    Dichtung.” To this reference has been made.There is also another
    briefer study of this connection: a Programm by F. Bauer, “Ueber
    den Einfluss, Laurence Sternes auf Chr.M. Wieland,” Karlsbad,
    1898.A. Mager published, 1890, at Marburg, “Wieland’s Nachlass
    des Diogenes von Sinope und das englische Vorbild,” a school
    “Abhandlung,” which dealt with a connection between this work of
    Wieland and Sterne.Wood (“Einfluss Fieldings auf die deutsche
    Litteratur,” Yokohama, 1895) finds constant imitation of Sterne in
    “Don Silvio,” which, from Behmer’s proof concerning the dates of
    Wieland’s acquaintance with Sterne, can hardly be possible.][Footnote 29: Some other works are mentioned as containing
    references and allusions.][Footnote 30: In “Oberon” alone of Wieland’s later works does
    Behmer discover Sterne’s influence and there no longer in the
    style, but in the adaptation of motif.][Footnote 31: See Erich Schmidt’s “Richardson, Rousseau und
    Goethe,” Jena, 1875, pp.[Footnote 32: 1790, I, pp.[Footnote 33: This may be well compared with Wieland’s statements
    concerning Shandy in his review of the Bode translation (_Merkur_,
    VIII, pp.247-51, 1774), which forms one of the most exaggerated
    expressions of adoration in the whole epoch of Sterne’s
    popularity.][Footnote 34: Since Germany did not sharply separate the work of
    Sterne from his continuator, this is, of course, to be classed
    from the German point of view at that time as a borrowing from
    Sterne.Mager in his study depends upon the Eugenius continuation
    for this and several other parallels.][Footnote 35: Sentimental Journey, pp.[Footnote 36: “Ich denke nicht, dass es Sie gereuen wird, den Mann

    understanding of his characteristics is indicated incidentally in
    a review of a Swedish book in the _Teutscher Merkur_, 1782, II,
    p.192, in which he designates the description of sentimental
    journeying in the seventh book of Shandy as the best of Sterne’s
    accomplishment, as greater than the Journey itself, a judgment

IMITATORS OF STERNE


Among the disciples of Sterne in Germany whose literary imitation may be
regarded as typical of their master’s influence, Johann Georg Jacobi is
perhaps the best known.His relation to the famous “Lorenzodosen”
conceit is sufficient to link his name with that of Yorick.Martin[1]
asserts that he was called “Uncle Toby” in Gleim’s circle because of his
enthusiasm for Sterne.The indebtedness of Jacobi to Sterne is the
subject of a special study by Dr.Joseph Longo, “Laurence Sterne und
Johann Georg Jacobi;” and the period of Jacobi’s literary work which
falls under the spell of Yorick has also been treated in an inaugural
dissertation, “Ueber Johann Georg Jacobi’s Jugendwerke,” by Georg
Ransohoff.The detail of Jacobi’s indebtedness to Sterne is to be found
in these two works.Longo was unable to settle definitely the date of Jacobi’s first
acquaintance with Sterne.The first mention made of him is in the letter
to Gleim of April 4, 1769, and a few days afterward,--April 10,--the
intelligence is afforded that he himself is working on a “journey.” The
“Winterreise” was published at Düsseldorf in the middle of June, 1769.Externally the work seems more under the influence of the French
wanderer Chapelle, since prose and verse are used irregularly
alternating, a style quite different from the English model.There are
short and unnumbered chapters, as in the Sentimental Journey, but,
unlike Sterne, Jacobi, with one exception, names no places and makes no
attempt at description of place or people, other than the sentimental
individuals encountered on the way.He makes no analysis of national, or
even local characteristics: the journey, in short, is almost completely
without place-influence.There is in the volume much more exuberance of
fancy, grotesque at times, a more conscious exercise of the picturing
imagination than we find in Sterne.There is use, too, of mythological
figures quite foreign to Sterne, an obvious reminiscence of Jacobi’s
Anacreontic experience.He exaggerates Yorick’s sentimentalism, is more
weepy, more tender, more sympathizing; yet, as Longo does not
sufficiently emphasize, he does not touch the whimsical side of Yorick’s
work.Jacobi, unlike his model, but in common with other German
imitators, is insistent in instruction and serious in contention for pet
theories, as is exemplified by the discussion of the doctrine of
immortality.There are opinions to be maintained, there is a message to
be delivered.Jacobi in this does not give the lie to his nationality.Like other German imitators, too, he took up with especial feeling the
relations between man and the animal world, an attitude to be connected
with several familiar episodes in Sterne.[2] The two chapters, “Der
Heerd” and “Der Taubenschlag,” tell of a sentimental farmer who mourns
over the fact that his son has cut down a tree in which the nightingale
was wont to nest.A similar sentimental regard is cherished in this
family for the doves, which no one killed, because no one could eat
them.Even as Yorick meets a Franciscan, Jacobi encounters a Jesuit
whose heart leaps to meet his own, and later, after the real journey is
done, a visit to a lonely cloister gives opportunity for converse with a
monk, like Pater Lorenzo,--tender, simple and humane.The “Sommerreise,” according to Longo, appeared in the latter part of
September, 1769, a less important work, which, in the edition of 1807,
Jacobi considered unworthy of preservation.Imitation of Sterne is
marked: following a criticism by Wieland the author attempts to be
humorous, but with dubious success; he introduces a Sterne-like
sentimental character which had not been used in the “Winterreise,”
a beggar-soldier, and he repeats the motif of human sympathy for animals
in the story of the lamb.Sympathy with erring womanhood is expressed in
the incidents related in “Die Fischerhütte” and “Der Geistliche.” These
two books were confessedly inspired by Yorick, and contemporary
criticism treated them as Yorick products.The _Deutsche Bibliothek der
schönen Wissenschaften_, published by Jacobi’s friend Klotz, would
naturally favor the volumes.Its review of the “Winterreise” is
non-critical and chiefly remarkable for the denial of foreign imitation.The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_,[3] in reviewing the same work pays
a significant tribute to Sterne, praising his power of disclosing the
good and beautiful in the seemingly commonplace.In direct criticism of
the book, the reviewer calls it a journey of fancy, the work of a
youthful poet rather than that of a sensitive philosopher.Wieland is
credited with the astounding opinion that he prefers the “Sommerreise”
to Yorick’s journey.[4] Longo’s characterization of Sterne is in the
main satisfactory, yet there is distinctly traceable the tendency to
ignore or minimize the whimsical elements of Sterne’s work: this is the
natural result of his approach to Sterne, through Jacobi, who understood
only the sentimentalism of the English master.[5]

Among the works of sentiment which were acknowledged imitations of
Yorick, along with Jacobi’s “Winterreise,” probably the most typical and
best known was the “Empfindsame Reisen durch Deutschland” by Johann
Gottlieb Schummel.Its importance as a document in the history of
sentimentalism is rather as an example of tendency than as a force
contributing materially to the spread of the movement.Its influence was
probably not great, though one reviewer does hint at a following.[6] Yet
the book has been remembered more persistently than any other work of
its genre, except Jacobi’s works, undoubtedly in part because it was
superior to many of its kind, partly, also, because its author won later
and maintained a position of some eminence, as a writer and a pedagogue;
but largely because Goethe’s well-known review of it in the _Frankfurter
Gelehrte Anzeigen_ has been cited as a remarkably acute contribution to
the discriminating criticism of the genuine and the affected in the
eighteenth-century literature of feeling, and has drawn attention from
the very fact of its source to the object of its criticism.Schummel was born in May, 1748, and hence was but twenty years of age
when Germany began to thrill in response to Yorick’s sentiments.It is
probable that the first volume was written while Schummel was still a
university student in 1768-1770.He assumed a position as teacher in
1771, but the first volume came out at Easter of that year; this would
probably throw its composition back into the year before.The second
volume appeared at Michaelmas of the same year.His publisher was
Zimmermann at Wittenberg and Zerbst, and the first volume at any rate
was issued in a new edition.The third volume came out in the spring of
1772.[7] Schummel’s title, “Empfindsame Reisen,” is, of course, taken
from the newly coined word in Bode’s title, but in face of this fact it
is rather remarkable to find that several quotations from Sterne’s
Journey, given in the course of the work, are from the Mittelstedt
translation.On two occasions, indeed, Schummel uses the title of the
Mittelstedt rendering as first published, “Versuch über die menschliche
Natur.”[8]

These facts lead one to believe that Schummel drew his inspiration from
the reading of this translation.This is interesting in connection with
Böttiger’s claim that the whole cavalcade of sentimental travelers who
trotted along after Yorick with all sorts of animals and vehicles was a
proof of the excellence and power of Bode’s translation.As one would
naturally infer from the title of Schummel’s fiction, the Sentimental
Journey is more constantly drawn upon as a source of ideas, motifs,
expression, and method, than Tristram Shandy, but the allusions to
Sterne’s earlier book, and the direct adaptations from it are both
numerous and generous.This fact has not been recognized by the critics,
and is not an easy inference from the contemporary reviews.The book is the result of an immediate impulse to imitation felt
irresistibly on the reading of Sterne’s narrative.That the critics and
readers of that day treated with serious consideration the efforts of a
callow youth of twenty or twenty-one in this direction is indicative
either of comparative vigor of execution, or of prepossession of the
critical world in favor of the literary genre,--doubtless of both.Schummel confesses that the desire to write came directly after the book
had been read.“I had just finished reading it,” he says, “and Heaven
knows with what pleasure, every word from ‘as far as this matter is
concerned’ on to ‘I seized the hand of the lady’s maid,’ were imprinted
in my soul with small invisible letters.” The characters of the Journey
stood “life-size in his very soul.” Involuntarily his inventive powers
had sketched several plans for a continuation, releasing Yorick from the
hand of the _fille de chambre_.But what he attempts is not a
continuation but a German parallel.In the outward events of his story, in the general trend of its
argument, Schummel does not depend upon either Shandy or the Journey:
the hero’s circumstances are in general not traceable to the English
model, but, spasmodically, the manner of narration and the nature of the
incidents are quite slavishly copied.A complete summary of the thread
of incident on which the various sentimental adventures, whimsical
speculations and digressions are hung, can be dispensed with: it is only
necessary to note instances where connection with Sterne as a model can
be established.Schummel’s narrative is often for many successive pages
absolutely straightforward and simple, unbroken by any attempt at
Shandean buoyancy, and unblemished by overwrought sentiment.At the
pausing places he generally indulges in Sternesque quibbling.A brief analysis of the first volume, with especial reference to the
appropriation of Yorick features, will serve to show the extent of
imitation, and the nature of the method.In outward form the Sentimental
Journey is copied.The volume is not divided into chapters, but there
are named divisions: there is also Yorick-like repetition of
section-headings.Naturally the author attempts at the very beginning to
strike a note distinctly suggesting Sterne: “Is he dead, the old
cousin?” are the first words of the volume, uttered by the hero on
receipt of the news, and in Yorick fashion he calls for guesses
concerning the mien with which the words were said.The conversation of
the various human passions with Yorick concerning the advisability of
offering the lady in Calais a seat in his chaise is here directly
imitated in the questions put by avarice, vanity, etc., concerning the
cousin’s death.The actual journey does not begin until page 97, a brief
autobiography of the hero occupying the first part of the book; this
inconsequence is confessedly intended to be a Tristram Shandy whim.[9]
The author’s relation to his parents is adapted directly from Shandy,
since he here possesses an incapable, unpractical, philosophizing
father, who determines upon methods for the superior education of his
son; and a simple, silly mockery of a mother.Left, however, an orphan, he begins his sentimental adventures: thrust
on the world he falls in with a kindly baker’s wife whose conduct toward
him brings tears to the eyes of the ten-year old lad, this showing his
early appetite for sentimental journeying.A large part of this first
section relating to his early life and youthful struggles, his kindly
benefactor, his adventure with Potiphar’s wife, is simple and direct,
with only an occasional hint of Yorick’s influence in word or phrase, as
if the author, now and then, recalled the purpose and the inspiration.For example, not until near the bottom of page 30 does it occur to him
to be abrupt and indulge in Shandean eccentricities, and then again,
after a few lines, he resumes the natural order of discourse.And again,
on page 83, he breaks off into attempted frivolity and Yorick
whimsicality of narration.In starting out upon his journey the author
says: “I will tread in Yorick’s foot-prints, what matters it if I do not
fill them out?My heart is not so broad as his, the sooner can it be
filled; my head is not so sound; my brain not so regularly formed.My
eyes are not so clear, but for that he was born in England and I in
Germany; he is a man and I am but a youth, in short, he is Yorick and I
am not Yorick.” He determines to journey where it is most sentimental
and passes the various lands in review in making his decision.Having
fastened upon Germany, he questions himself similarly with reference to
the cities.Yorick’s love of lists, of mock-serious discrimination, of
inconsequential reasonings is here copied.The call upon epic, tragic,
lyric poets, musicians, etc., which follows here is a further imitation
of Yorick’s list-making and pseudo-scientific method.On his way to Leipzig, in the post-chaise, the author falls in with a
clergyman: the manner of this meeting is intended to be Sterne-like:
Schummel sighs, the companion remarks, “You too are an unhappy one,” and
they join hands while the human heart beams in the traveler’s eyes.But, apart from these external incidents of their
meeting, the matter of their converse is in no way inspired by Sterne.It joins itself with the narrative of the author’s visit to a church in
a village by the wayside, and deals in general with the nature of the
clergyman’s relation to his people and the general mediocrity and
ineptitude of the average homiletical discourse, the failure of
clergymen to relate their pulpit utterance to the life of the common
Christian,--all of which is genuine, sane and original, undoubtedly a
real protest on the part of Schummel, the pedagogue, against a
prevailing abuse of his time and other times.This section represents
unquestionably the earnest convictions of its author, and is written
with professional zeal.This division is followed by an evidently
purposeful return to Sterne’s eccentricity of manner.The author begins
a division of his narrative, “Der zerbrochene Postwagen,” which is
probably meant to coincide with the post-chaise accident in Shandy’s
travels, writes a few lines in it, then begins the section again,
something like the interrupted story of the King of Bohemia and his
Seven Castles.Then follows an abrupt discursive study of his aptitudes
and proclivities, interspersed with Latin exclamations, interrogation
points and dashes.“What a parenthesis is that!” he cries, and a few
lines further on, “I burn with longing to begin a parenthesis again.” On
his arrival in Leipzig, Schummel imitates closely Sterne’s satirical
guide-book description of Calais[10] in his brief account of the city,
breaking off abruptly like Sterne, and roundly berating all
“Reisebeschreiber.” Here in fitting contrast with this superficial
enumeration of facts stands his brief traveler’s creed, an interest in
people rather than in places, all of which is derived from Sterne’s
chapter, “In the Street, Calais,” in which the master discloses the
sentimental possibilities of traveling and typifies the superficial,
unemotional wanderer in the persons of Smelfungus and Mundungus, and
from the familiar passage in “The Passport, Versailles,” beginning, “But
I could wish to spy out the nakedness, etc.” No sooner is he arrived in
Leipzig, than he accomplishes a sentimental rescue of an unfortunate
woman on the street.In the expression of her immediate needs, Schummel
indulges for the first time in a row of stars, with the obvious
intention of raising a low suggestion, which he contradicts with
mock-innocent questionings a few lines later, thereby fastening the
attention on the possibility of vulgar interpretation.Sterne is guilty
of this device in numerous instances in both his works, and the English
continuation of the Sentimental Journey relies upon it in greater and
more revolting measure.Once established in his hotel, the author betakes himself to the
theater: this very act he feels will bring upon him the censure of the
critics, for Yorick went to the theater too.“A merchant’s boy went
along before me,” he says in naïve defense, “was he also an imitator of
Yorick?” On the way he meets a fair maid-in-waiting, and the relation
between her and the traveler, developed here and later, is inspired
directly by Yorick’s connection with the fair _fille de chambre_.Schummel imitates Sterne’s excessive detail of description, devoting a
whole paragraph to his manner of removing his hat before a lady whom he
encounters on this walk to the theater.This was another phase of
Sterne’s pseudo-scientific method: he describes the trivial with the
attitude of the trained observer, registering minutely the detail of
phenomena, a mock-parade of scholarship illustrated by his description
of Trim’s attitude while reading his sermon, or the dropping of the hat
in the kitchen during the memorable scene when the news of Bobby’s death
is brought.In Schummel’s narration of his adventures in the house of ill-repute
there are numerous sentimental excrescences in his conduct with the poor
prisoner there, due largely to Yorick’s pattern, such as their weeping
on one another’s breast, and his wiping away her tears and his, drawn
from Yorick’s amiable service for Maria of Moulines, an act seemingly
expressing the most refined human sympathy.The remaining events of this
first volume include an unexpected meeting with the kind baker’s wife,
which takes place at Gellert’s grave.Yorick’s imitators were especially
fond of re-introducing a sentimental relationship.Yorick led the way in
his renewed acquaintance with the _fille de chambre_; Stevenson in his
continuation went to extremes in exploiting this cheap device.Other motifs derived from Sterne, less integral, may be briefly
summarized.From the Sentimental Journey is taken the motif that
valuable or interesting papers be used to wrap ordinary articles of
trade: here herring are wrapped in fragments of the father’s philosophy;
in the Sentimental Journey we find a similar degrading use for the
“Fragment.” Schummel breaks off the chapter “La Naïve,”[11] under the
Sternesque subterfuge of having to deliver manuscript to an insistent
publisher.Yorick writes his preface to the Journey in the
“Désobligeant,” that is, in the midst of the narrative itself.Schummel
modifies the eccentricity merely by placing his foreword at the end of
the volume.The value of it, he says, will repay the reader for waiting
so long,--a statement which finds little justification in the preface
itself.It begins, “Auweh!Diable, mein
Rücken, mein Fuss!” and so on for half a page,--a pitiful effort to
follow the English master’s wilful and skilful incoherence.The
following pages, however, once this outbreak is at an end, contain a
modicum of sense, the feeble, apologetic explanation of his desire in
imitating Yorick, given in forethought of the critics’ condemnation.Similarly the position of the dedication is unusual, in the midst of the
volume, even as the dedication of Shandy was roguishly delayed.The
dedication itself, however, is not an imitation of Sterne’s clever
satire, but, addressed to Yorick himself, is a striking example of
burning personal devotion and over-wrought praise.Schummel hopes[12] in
Sterne fashion to write a chapter on “Vorübergeben,” or in the chapter
“Das Komödienhaus” (pp.185-210) to write a digression on “Walking
behind a maid.” Like Sterne, he writes in praise of digressions.[13] In
imitation of Sterne is conceived the digressive speculation concerning
the door through which at the beginning of the book he is cast into the
rude world.Among further expressions savoring of Sterne, may be
mentioned a “Centner of curses” (p.39), a “Quentchen of curses,” and
the analytical description of a tone of voice as one-fourth questioning,
five-eighths entreating and one-eighth commanding (p. 229).The direct allusions to Sterne and his works are numerous.A list of
Sterne characters which were indelibly impressed upon his mind is found
near the very beginning (pp.3-4); other allusions are to M. Dessein
(p.65), La Fleur’s “Courierstiefel” (p.115), the words of the dying
Yorick (p.128), the pococurantism of Mrs.187), the division
of travelers into types (p.200), Yorick’s
violin-playing (p.274), the foolish fat scullion (p.290), Yorick’s
description of a maid’s (p.188) eyes, “als ob sie zwischen vier Wänden
einem Garaus machen könnten.”

The second volume is even more incoherent in narration, and contains
less genuine occurrence and more ill-considered attempts at
whimsicality, yet throughout this volume there are indications that the
author is awakening to the vulnerability of his position, and this is in
no other particular more easily discernible than in the half-hearted
defiance of the critics and his anticipation of their censure.The
change, so extraordinary in the third volume, is foreshadowed in the
second.Purely sentimental, effusive, and abundantly teary is the story
of the rescued baker’s wife.In this excess of sentiment, Schummel shows
his intellectual appreciation of Sterne’s individual treatment of the
humane and pathetic, for near the end of the poor woman’s narrative the
author seems to recollect a fundamental sentence of Sterne’s creed, the
inevitable admixture of the whimsical, and here he introduces into the
sentimental relation a Shandean idiosyncrasy: from page 43 the narrative
leaps back to the beginning of the volume, and Schummel advises the
reader to turn back and re-read, referring incidentally to his confused
fashion of narration.The awkwardness with which this is done proves
Schummel’s inability to follow Yorick, though its use shows his
appreciation of Sterne’s peculiar genius.The visit of the author, the
baker’s wife and her daughter (the former lady’s maid) to the graveyard
is Yorickian in flavor, and the plucking of nettles from the grave of
the dead epileptic is a direct borrowing.Attempts to be immorally,
sensuously suggestive in the manner of Sterne are found in the so-called
chapter on “Button-holes,” here cast in a more Shandean vein, and in the
adventure “die ängstliche Nacht,”--in the latter case resembling more
the less frank, more insinuating method of the Sentimental Journey.The
sentimental attitude toward man’s dumb companions is imitated in his
adventure with the house-dog; the author fears the barking of this
animal may disturb the sleep of the poor baker’s wife: he beats the dog
into silence, then grows remorseful and wishes “that I had given him no
blow,” or that the dog might at least give him back the blows.His
thought that the dog might be pretending its pain, he designates a
subtle subterfuge of his troubled conscience, and Goethe, in the review
mentioned above, exclaims, “A fine pendant to Yorick’s scene with the
Monk.”

Distinctly Shandean are the numerous digressions, as on imitation
(p.16), on authors and fairs (p.226-238)
“ein ganz originelles Gemische von Wiz, Belesenheit, Scharfsinn,
gesunder Philosophie, Erfahrung, Algebra und Mechanik,” or (p.253) “Von
der Entstehungsart eines Buches nach Erfindung der Buchdrukerkunst,”
which in reference to Sterne’s phrase, is called a “jungfräuliche
Materie.” He promises (pp.75 and 108), like Sterne, to write numerous
chapters on extraordinary subjects,--indeed, he announces his intention
of supplementing the missing sections of Shandy on “Button-holes” and on
the “Right and Left (sic) end of a Woman.” His own promised effusions
are to be “Ueber die roten und schwarzen Röcke,” “über die Verbindung
der Theologie mit Schwarz,” “Europäischenfrauenzimmerschuhabsätze,” half
a one “Ueber die Schuhsohlen” and “Ueber meinen Namen.”

His additions to Shandy are flat and witless, that on the “Right and
Wrong End of a Woman” (pp.degenerating into three brief
narratives displaying woman’s susceptibility to flattery, the whole idea
probably adapted from Sterne’s chapter, “An Act of Charity;” the chapter
on “Button-holes” is made a part of the general narrative of his
relation to his “Naïve.” Weakly whimsical is his seeking pardon for the
discourse with which the Frenchman (pp.62-66), under the pretext that
it belonged somewhere else and had inadvertently crept in.Shandean also
is the black margin to pages 199-206, the line upside down (p.175),
the twelve irregularly printed lines (p.331), inserted to indicate his
efforts in writing with a burned hand, the lines of dashes and
exclamation points, the mathematical, financial calculation of the worth
of his book from various points of view, and the description of the
maiden’s walk (p. 291).Sterne’s mock-scientific method, as already
noted, is observable again in the statement of the position of the
dagger “at an angle of 30°” (p. 248).His coining of new words, for
which he is censured by the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_, is also a
legacy of Yorick’s method.The third volume bears little relation to Sterne aside from its title,
and one can only wonder, in view of the criticism of the two parts
already published and the nature of the author’s own partial revulsion
of feeling, that he did not give up publishing it altogether, or choose
another title, and sunder the work entirely from the foregoing volumes,
with which it has in fact so contradictory a connection.It may be that
his relations to the publisher demanded the issuing of the third part
under the same title.This volume is easily divisible into several distinct parts, which are
linked with one another, and to the preceding narrative, only by a
conventional thread of introduction.These comprise: the story of
Caroline and Rosenfeld, a typical eighteenth century tale of love,
seduction and flight; the hosts’ ballad, “Es war einmahl ein Edelmann;”
the play, “Die unschuldige Ehebrecherin” and “Mein Tagebuch,” the
journal of an honest preacher, and a further sincere exploitation of
Schummel’s ideas upon the clergyman’s office, his ideal of simplicity,
kindliness, and humanity.In the latter part of the book Schummel
resumes his original narrative, and indulges once more in the luxury of
sentimental adventure, but without the former abortive attempts at
imitating Sterne’s peculiarities of diction.This last resumption of the
sentimental creed introduces to us one event evidently inspired by
Yorick: he meets a poor, maimed soldier-beggar.Since misfortune has
deprived the narrator himself of his possessions, he can give nothing
and goes a begging for the beggar’s sake, introducing the new and highly
sentimental idea of “vicarious begging” (pp.In the following
episode, a visit to a child-murderess, Schummel leaves a page entirely
blank as an appropriate proof of incapacity to express his emotions
attendant on the execution of the unfortunate.Sterne also left a page
blank for the description of the Widow Wadman’s charms.At the very end of the book Schummel drops his narrative altogether and
discourses upon his own work.It would be difficult to find in any
literature so complete a condemnation of one’s own serious and extensive
endeavor, so candid a criticism of one’s own work, so frank an
acknowledgment of the pettiness of one’s achievement.He says his work,
as an imitation of Sterne’s two novels, has “few or absolutely no
beauties of the original, and many faults of its own.” He states that
his enthusiasm for Tristram has been somewhat dampened by Sonnenfels and
Riedel; he sees now faults which should not have been imitated; the
frivolous attitude of the narrator toward his father and mother is
deprecated, and the suggestion is given that this feature was derived
from Tristram’s own frankness concerning the eccentricities and
incapacities of his parents.He begs reference to a passage in the
second volume[14] where the author alludes with warmth of appreciation
to his real father and mother; that is, genuine regard overcame the
temporary blindness, real affection arose and thrust out the transitory
inclination to an alien whimsicality.Schummel admits that he has utterly failed in his effort to characterize
the German people in the way Sterne treated the English and French; he
confesses that the ninety-page autobiography which precedes the journey
itself was intended to be Tristram-like, but openly stigmatizes his own
failure as “ill conceived, incoherent and not very well told!” After
mentioning some few incidents and passages in this first section which
he regards as passable, he boldly condemns the rest as “almost beneath
all criticism,” and the same words are used with reference to much that
follows, in which he confesses to imitation, bad taste and intolerable
indelicacy.He calls his pathetic attempts at whimsical mannerisms
(Heideldum, etc.), “kläglich, überaus kläglich,” expresses the opinion
that one would not be surprised at the reader who would throw away the
whole book at such a passage.The words of the preacher in the two
sections where he is allowed to air his opinions still meet with his
approval, and the same is true of one or two other sections.In
conclusion, he states that the first part contains hardly one hundred
good pages, and that the second part is worse than the first, so that he
is unwilling to look at it again and seek out its faults.The absence of
allusions to Sterne’s writings is marked, except in the critical section
at the end, he mentions Sterne but once (p.239), where he calls him
“schnurrigt.” This alteration of feeling must have taken place in a
brief space of time, for the third volume is signed April 25, 1772.It
is not easy to establish with probability the works of Sonnenfels and
Riedel which are credited with a share in this revulsion of feeling.In all of this Schummel is a discriminating critic of his own work; he
is also discerning in his assertion that the narrative contained in his
volume is conceived more in the vein of Fielding and Richardson.The
Sterne elements are rather embroidered on to the other fabric, or, as he
himself says, using another figure, “only fried in Shandy fat.”[15]

Goethe’s criticism of the second volume, already alluded to, is found in
the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ in the issue of March 3, 1772.The
nature of the review is familiar: Goethe calls the book a thistle which
he has found on Yorick’s grave.“Alles,” he says, “hat es dem guten
Yorick geraubt, Speer, Helm und Lanze, nur Schade!inwendig steckt der
Herr Präceptor S. zu Magdeburg.Yorick empfand, und dieser setzt
sich hin zu empfinden.Yorick wird von seiner Laune ergriffen, und
weinte und lachte in einer Minute und durch die Magie der Sympathie
lachen und weinen wir mit: hier aber steht einer und überlegt: wie lache
und weine ich?was werden die Leute sagen, wenn ich lache und weine?”
etc.Schummel is stigmatized as a childish imitator and his book is
censured as “beneath criticism,” oddly enough the very judgment its own
author accords but a few weeks later on the completion of the third
volume.The review contains several citations illustrative of Schummel’s
style.The first two parts were reviewed in the _Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek_.[16] The length of the review is testimony to the interest
in the book, and the tone of the article, though frankly unfavorable,
is not so emphatically censorious as the one first noted.It is observed
that Schummel has attempted the impossible,--the adoption of another’s
“Laune,” and hence his failure.The reviewer notes, often with generous
quotations, the more noticeable, direct imitations from Sterne, the
conversation of the emotions, the nettle-plucking at the grave, the
eccentric orthography and the new-coined words.Several passages of
comment or comparison testify to the then current admiration of Yorick,
and the conventional German interpretation of his character; “sein
gutes, empfindungsvolles Herz, mit Tugend und sittlichem Gefühl
erfüllt.” The review is signed “Sr:”[17]

A critic in the _Jenaische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen_ for January
17, 1772, treating the first two volumes, expresses the opinion that
Jacobi, the author of the “Tagereise,” and Schummel have little but the
title from Yorick.The author’s seeking for opportunity to dissolve in
emotion is contrasted unfavorably with Yorick’s method, the affected
style is condemned, yet it is admitted that the work promises better
things from its talented author; his power of observation and his good
heart are not to be unacknowledged.The severity of the review is
directed against the imitators already arising.The _Magazin der deutschen Critik_[18] reviews the third volume with
favorable comment; the comedy which Schummel saw fit to insert is
received with rather extraordinary praise, and the author is urged to
continue work in the drama; a desire is expressed even for a fourth
part.The _Hamburgische Neue Zeitung_, June 4 and October 29, 1771,
places Schummel unhesitatingly beside the English master, calls him as
original as his pattern, to Sterne belongs the honor only of the
invention.The author is hailed as a genius whose talents should be
supported, so that Germany would not have to envy England her
Yorick.[19]

After Schummel’s remarkable self-chastisement, one could hardly expect
to find in his subsequent works evidence of Sterne’s influence, save as
unconsciously a dimmed admiration might exert a certain force.Probably
contemporaneous with the composition of the third volume of the work,
but possibly earlier, Schummel wrote the fourth part of a ponderous
novel by a fellow Silesian, Christian Opitz, entitled “Die Gleichheit
der menschlichen Herzen, bey der Ungleichheit ihrer äusserlichen
Umstände in der Geschichte Herrn Redlichs und seiner Bedienten.” Goedeke
implies that Opitz was the author of all but the last part, but the
reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[20] maintains that each
part has a different author, and quotes the preface to the fourth as
substantiation.According to this review both the second and fourth
parts are characterized by a humorous fashion in writing, and the last
is praised as being the best of the four.It seems probable that
Schummel’s enthusiasm for Sterne played its part in the composition of
this work.Possibly encouraged by the critic’s approbation, Schummel devoted his
literary effort for the following years largely to the drama.In 1774 he
published his “Uebersetzer-Bibliothek zum Gebrauche der Uebersetzer,
Schulmänner und Liebhaber der alten Litteratur.” The reviewer[21] in the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ finds passages in this book in which
the author of the “Empfindsame Reisen” is visible,--where his fancy runs
away with his reason,--and a passage is quoted in which reference is
made to Slawkenberg’s book on noses.It would seem that the seeking for
wit survived the crude sentimentality.Two years later Schummel published “Fritzen’s Reise nach Dessau,”[22]
a work composed of letters from a twelve-year old boy, written on a
journey from Magdeburg to Dessau.The letters are quite without whim or
sentiment, and the book has been remembered for the extended description
of Basedow’s experimental school, “Philantropin” (opened in 1774).Its
account has been the source of the information given of this endeavor in
some pedagogical treatises[23] and it was re-issued, as a document in
the history of pedagogical experiment, in Leipzig, by Albert Richter in
1891.About fifteen years later still the “Reise durch Schlesien”[24]
was issued.It is a simple narrative of a real journey with description
of places and people, frankly personal, almost epistolary in form,
without a suggestion of Sterne-like whim or sentiment.One passage is
significant as indicating the author’s realization of his change of
attitude.The sight of a group of prisoners bound by a chain calls to
his memory his former sentimental extravagance, and he exclaims: “Twenty
years ago, when I was still a sentimental traveler, I would have wasted
many an ‘Oh’ and ‘alas’ over this scene; at present, since I have
learned to know the world and mankind somewhat more intimately, I think
otherwise.”

Johann Christian Bock (1724-1785), who was in 1772 theater-poet of the
Ackerman Company in Hamburg, soon after the publication of the
Sentimental Journey, identified himself with the would-be Yoricks by the
production of “Die Tagereise,” which was published at Leipzig in 1770.The work was re-issued in 1775 with the new title “Die Geschichte eines
empfundenen Tages.”[25] The only change in the new edition was the
addition of a number of copperplate engravings.The book is inspired in
part by Sterne directly, and in part indirectly through the intermediary
Jacobi.Unlike the work of Schummel just treated, it betrays no Shandean
influence, but is dependent solely on the Sentimental Journey.In
outward form the book resembles Jacobi’s “Winterreise,” since verse is
introduced to vary the prose narrative.The attitude of the author
toward his journey, undertaken with conscious purpose, is characteristic
of the whole set of emotional sentiment-seekers, who found in their
Yorick a challenge to go and do likewise: “Everybody is journeying,
I thought, and took Yorick and Jacobi with me.I will really see
whether I too may not chance upon a _fille de chambre_ or a
harvest-maid,” is a very significant statement of his inspiration and
intention.Once started on his journey, the author falls in with a poor
warrior-beggar, an adaptation of Sterne’s Chevalier de St.Louis,[26]
and he puts in verse Yorick’s expressed sentiment that the king and the
fatherland should not allow the faithful soldier to fall into such
distress.Bock’s next sentimental adventure is with a fair peasant-maid whom he
sees weeping by the wayside.Through Yorick-like insistence of sympathy,
he finally wins from her information concerning the tender situation:
a stern stepfather, an unwelcome suitor of his choosing, and a lover of
her own.Her inability to write and thus communicate with the latter is
the immediate cause of the present overflow.The traveler beholds in
this predicament a remarkable sentimental opportunity and offers his
services; he strokes her cheek, her tears are dried, and they part like
brother and sister.The episode is unquestionably inspired by the
episode of Maria of Moulines; in the latter development of the affair,
the sentiment, which is expressed, that the girl’s innocence is her own
defense is borrowed directly from Yorick’s statement concerning the
_fille de chambre_.[27] The traveler’s questioning of his own motives in
“Die Ueberlegung”[28] is distinctly Sterne-like, and it demonstrates
also Bock’s appreciation of this quizzical element in Yorick’s attitude
toward his own sentimental behavior.The relation of man to the domestic
animals is treated sentimentally in the episode of the old beggar and
his dead dog:[29] the tears of the beggar, his affection for the beast,
their genuine comradeship, and the dog’s devotion after the world had
forsaken his master, are all part and parcel of that fantastic humane
movement which has its source in Yorick’s dead ass.Bock practically
confesses his inspiration by direct allusion to the episode in Yorick.Bock defends with warmth the old peasant and his grief.The wanderer’s acquaintance with the lady’s companion[30] is adapted
from Yorick’s _fille de chambre_ connection, and Bock cannot avoid a
fleshly suggestion, distinctly in the style of Yorick in the section,
the “Spider.”[31] The return journey in the sentimental moonlight
affords the author another opportunity for the exercise of his broad
human sympathy: he meets a poor woman, a day-laborer with her child,
gives them a few coins and doubts whether king or bishop could be more
content with the benediction of the apostolic chair than he with the
blessing of this unfortunate,--a sentiment derived from Yorick’s
overcolored veneration for the horn snuff-box.The churchyard scene with which the journey ends is more openly
fanciful, down-right visionary in tone, but the manner is very
emphatically not that of Sterne, though in the midst the Sterne motif of
nettle-plucking is introduced.This sentimental episode took hold of
German imagination with peculiar force.The hobby-horse idea also was
sure of its appeal, and Bock did not fail to fall under its spell.[32]

But apart from the general impulse and borrowing of motif from the
foreign novel, there is in this little volume considerable that is
genuine and original: the author’s German patriotism, his praise of the
old days in the Fatherland in the chapter entitled “Die Gaststube,” his
“Trinklied eines Deutschen,” his disquisition on the position of the
poet in the world (“ein eignes Kapitel”), and his adulation of Gellert
at the latter’s grave.The reviewer in the _Deutsche Bibliothek der
schönen Wissenschaften_[33] chides the unnamed, youthful author for not
allowing his undeniable talents to ripen to maturity, for being led on
by Jacobi’s success to hasten his exercises into print.In reality Bock
was no longer youthful (forty-six) when the “Tagereise” was published.The _Almanach der deutschen Musen_ for 1771, calls the book “an
unsuccessful imitation of Yorick and Jacobi,” and wishes that this
“Rhapsodie von Cruditäten” might be the last one thrust on the market as
a “Sentimental Journey.” The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[34]
comments also on the double inspiration, and the insufficiency and
tiresomeness of the performance.And yet Boie[35] says the papers
praised the little book; for himself, however, he observes, he little
desires to read it, and adds “What will our Yoricks yet come to?At last
they will get pretty insignificant, I think, if they keep on this way.”

Bock was also the author of a series of little volumes written in the
early seventies, still under the sentimental charm: (1) Empfindsame
Reise durch die Visitenzimmer am Neujahrstag von einem deutschen Yorick
angestellt, Cosmopolis (Hamburg) 1771--really published at the end of
the previous year; (2) . . .am Ostertage, 1772; (3) Am Pfingsttage,
1772; (4) Am Johannistage, 1773; (5) Am Weynachtstage, 1773.These books
were issued anonymously, and Schröder’s Lexicon gives only (2) and (3)
under Bock’s name, but there seems no good reason to doubt his
authorship of them all.Indeed, his claim to (1) is, according to the
_Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_, well-nigh proven by an allusion to the
“Tagereise” in the introduction, and by the initials signed.None of
them are given by Goedeke.The books are evidently only in a general way
dependent on the Sterne model, and are composed of observations upon all
sorts of subjects, the first section of each volume bearing some
relation to the festival in which they appear.In the second edition of the first volume the author confesses that the
title only is derived from Yorick,[36] and states that he was forced to
this misuse because no one at that time cared to read anything but
“Empfindsame Reisen.” It is also to be noted that the description
beneath the title, “von einem deutschen Yorick angestellt,” is omitted
after the first volume.The review of (4) and (5) in the _Altonaer
Reichs-Postreuter_ finds this a commendable resumption of proper
humility.The observations are evidently loosely strung together without
the pretense of a narrative, such as “Allgemeines Perspectiv durch alle
Visitenzimmer, Empfindsamer Neujahrswunsch, Empfindsame Berechnung eines
Weisen mit sich selbst, Empfindsame Entschlüsse, Empfindsame Art sein
Geld gut unterzubringen,” etc.[37] An obvious purpose inspires the
writer, the furthering of morality and virtue; many of the meditations
are distinctly religious.That some of the observations had a local
significance in Hamburg, together with the strong sentimental tendency
there, may account for the warm reception by the _Hamburgischer
unpartheyischer Correspondent_.[38]

Some contemporary critics maintained a kinship between Matthias Claudius
and Yorick-Sterne, though nothing further than a similarity of mental
and emotional fibre is suggested.No one claimed an influence working
from the English master.Even as late as 1872, Wilhelm Röseler in his
introductory poem to a study of “Matthias Claudius und sein Humor”[39]
calls Asmus, “Deutschland’s Yorick,” thereby agreeing almost verbally
with the German correspondent of the _Deutsches Museum_, who wrote from
London nearly a hundred years before, September 14, 1778, “Asmus.is the German Sterne,” an assertion which was denied by a later
correspondent, who asserts that Claudius’s manner is very different from
that of Sterne.[40]

August von Kotzebue, as youthful narrator, betrays a dependence on
Sterne in his strange and ingeniously contrived tale, “Die Geschichte
meines Vaters, oder wie es zuging, dass ich gebohren wurde.”[41] The
influence of Sterne is noticeable in the beginning of the story:
he commences with a circumstantial account of his grandfather and
grandmother, and the circumstances of his father’s birth.The
grandfather is an original undoubtedly modeled on lines suggested by
Sterne’s hobby-horse idea.He had been chosen in days gone by to greet
the reigning prince on the latter’s return from a journey, and the old
man harks back to this circumstance with “hobby-horsical” persistence,
whatever the subject of conversation, even as all matters led Uncle Toby
to military fortification, and the elder Shandy to one of his pet
theories.In Schrimps the servant, another Shandean original is designed.When the
news comes of the birth of a son on Mount Vesuvius, master and man
discuss multifarious and irrelevant topics in a fashion reminiscent of
the conversation downstairs in the Shandy mansion while similar events
are going on above.Later in the book we have long lists, or catalogues
of things which resemble one of Sterne’s favorite mannerisms.But the
greater part of the wild, adventurous tale is far removed from its
inception, which presented domestic whimsicality in a gallery of
originals, unmistakably connected with Tristram Shandy.Göschen’s “Reise von Johann”[42] is a product of the late renascence of
sentimental journeying.Master and servant are represented in this book
as traveling through southern Germany, a pair as closely related in head
and heart as Yorick and La Fleur, or Captain Shandy and Corporal Trim.The style is of rather forced buoyancy and sprightliness, with
intentional inconsequence and confusion, an attempt at humor of
narration, which is choked by characteristic national desire to convey
information, and a fatal propensity to description of places,[43] even
when some satirical purpose underlies the account, as in the description
of Erlangen and its university.The servant Johann has mild adventures
with the maids in the various inns, which are reminiscent of Yorick,
and in one case it borders on the openly suggestive and more Shandean
method.[44] A distinctly borrowed motif is the accidental finding of
papers which contain matters of interest.This is twice resorted to;
a former occupant of the room in the inn in Nürnberg had left valuable
notes of travel; and Johann, meeting a ragged woman, bent on
self-destruction, takes from her a box with papers, disclosing a
revolting story, baldly told.German mediocrity, imitating Yorick in
this regard, and failing of his delicacy and subtlety, brought forth
hideous offspring.An attempt at whimsicality of style is apparent in
the “Furth Catechismus in Frage und Antwort” (pp.71-74), and genuinely
sentimental adventures are supplied by the death-bed scene (pp.70-71)
and the village funeral (pp.This book is classed by Ebeling[45] without sufficient reason as an
imitation of von Thümmel.This statement is probably derived from the
letter from Schiller to Goethe to which Ebeling refers in the following
lines.Schiller is writing to Goethe concerning plans for the Xenien,
December 29, 1795.[46] The abundance of material for the Xenien project
is commented upon with enthusiastic anticipation, and in a list of
vulnerable possibilities we read: “Thümmel, Göschen als sein
Stallmeister--” a collocation of names easily attributable, in
consideration of the underlying satiric purpose, to the general nature
of their work, without in any way implying the dependence of one author
on another,[47] or it could be interpreted as an allusion to the fact
that Göschen was von Thümmel’s publisher.Nor is there anything in the
correspondence to justify Ebeling’s harshness in saying concerning this
volume of Göschen, that it “enjoyed the honor of being ridiculed
(verhöhnt) in the Xenien-correspondence between Goethe and Schiller.”
Goethe replies (December 30), in approval, and exclaims, “How fine
Charis and Johann will appear beside one another.”[48] The suggestion
concerning a possible use of Göschen’s book in the Xenien was never
carried out.It will be remembered that Göschen submitted the manuscript of his book
to Schiller, and that Schiller returned the same with the statement
“that he had laughed heartily at some of the whims.[49]” Garve, in a
letter dated March 8, 1875, speaks of Göschen’s book in terms of
moderate praise.[50]

The “Empfindsame Reise von Oldenburg nach Bremen,”[51] the author of
which was a Hanoverian army officer, H. J. C. Hedemann, is characterized
by Ebeling as emphatically not inspired by Sterne.[52] Although it is
not a sentimental journey, as Schummel and Jacobi and Bock conceived it,
and is thus not an example of the earliest period of imitation, and
although it contains no passages of teary sentimentality in attitude
toward man and beast, one must hesitate in denying all connection with
Sterne’s manner.It would seem as if, having outgrown the earlier
Yorick, awakened from dubious, fine-spun dreams of human brotherhood,
perhaps by the rude clatter of the French revolution, certain would-be
men of letters turned to Yorick again and saw, as through a glass
darkly, that other element of his nature, and tried in lumbering,
Teutonic way to adopt his whimsicality, shorn now of sentimentalism, and
to build success for their wares on remembrance of a defaced idol.This
view of later sentimental journeying is practically acknowledged at any
rate in a contemporary review, the _Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung_ for
August 22, 1796, which remarks: “A sentimental voyage ist ein Quodlibet,
wo einige bekannte Sachen und Namen gezwungenen Wiz und matten Scherz
heben sollen.”[53]

Hedemann’s book is conspicuous in its effort to be whimsical and is
openly satirical in regard to the sentimentalism of former travelers.His endeavor is markedly in Sterne’s manner in his attitude toward the
writing of the book, his conversation about the difficulty of managing
the material, his discussion with himself and the reader about the
various parts of the book.Quite in Sterne’s fashion, and to be
associated with Sterne’s frequent promises of chapters, and statements
concerning embarrassment of material, is conceived his determination “to
mention some things beforehand about which I don’t know anything to
say,” and his rather humorous enumeration of them.The author satirizes
the real sentimental traveler of Sterne’s earlier imitators in the
following passage (second chapter):

“It really must be a great misfortune, an exceedingly vexatious case,
if no sentimental scenes occur to a sentimental traveler, but this is
surely not the case; only the subjects, which offer themselves must be
managed with strict economy.If one leaps over the most interesting
events entirely, one is in danger, indeed, of losing everything, at
least of not filling many pages.”

Likewise in the following account of a sentimental adventure, the
satirical purpose is evident.He has not gone far on his journey when he
is met by a troop of children; with unsentimental coldness he determines
that there is a “Schlagbaum” in the way.After the children have opened
the barrier, he debates with himself to which child to give his little
coin, concludes, as a “sentimental traveler,” to give it to the other
sex, then there is nothing left to do but to follow his instinct.He
reflects long with himself whether he was right in so doing,--all of
which is a deliberate jest at the hesitation with reference to trivial
acts, the self-examination with regard to the minutiae of past conduct,
which was copied by Sterne’s imitators from numerous instances in the
works of Yorick.Satirical also is his vision in Chapter VII, in which
he beholds the temple of stupidity where lofty stupidity sits on a paper
throne; and of particular significance here is the explanation that the
whole company who do “erhabene Dummheit” honor formerly lived in cities
of the kingdom, but “now they are on journeys.” Further examples of a
humorous manner akin to Sterne are: his statement that it would be a
“great error” to write an account of a journey without weaving in an
anecdote of a prince, his claim that he has fulfilled all duties of such
a traveler save to fall in love, his resolve to accomplish it, and his
formal declaration: “I, the undersigned, do vow and make promise to be
in love before twenty-four hours are past.” The story with which his
volume closes, “Das Ständchen,” is rather entertaining and is told
graphically, easily, without whim or satire, yet not without a Sternian
_double entendre_.[54]

Another work in which sentimentalism has dwindled away to a grinning
shade, and a certain irresponsible, light-hearted attitude is the sole
remaining connection with the great progenitor, is probably the
“Empfindsame Reise nach Schilda” (Leipzig, 1793), by Andreas Geo.von Rabenau, which is reviewed in the _Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung_
(1794, I, p.416) as a free revision of an old popular tale, “Das
lustige und lächerliche Lalenburg.” The book is evidently without
sentimental tinge, is a merry combination of wit and joke combined with
caricature and half-serious tilting against unimportant literary
celebrities.[55]

Certain miscellaneous works, which are more or less obviously connected
with Sterne may be grouped together here.To the first outburst of Sterne enthusiasm belongs an anonymous product,
“Zween Tage eines Schwindsüchtigen, etwas Empfindsames,” von L. . . .(Hamburg, 1772), yet the editor admits that the sentiment is “not
entirely like Yorick’s,” and the _Altonaer Reichs-Postreuter_ (July 2,
1772) adds that “not at all like Yorick’s” would have been nearer the
truth.This book is mentioned by Hillebrand with implication that it is
the extreme example of the absurd sentimental tendency, probably judging
merely from the title,[56] for the book is doubtless merely thoughtful,
contemplative, with a minimum of overwrought feeling.According to the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ (1775, pp.592-3),
another product of the earlier seventies, the “Leben und Schicksale des
Martin Dickius,” by Johann Moritz Schwager, is in many places a clever
imitation of Sterne,[57] although the author claims, like Wezel in
“Tobias Knaut,” not to have read Shandy until after the book was
written.Surely the digression on noses which the author allows himself
is suspicious.Blankenburg, the author of the treatise on the novel to which reference
has been made, was regarded by contemporary and subsequent criticism as
an imitator of Sterne in his oddly titled novel “Beyträge zur Geschichte
des teutschen Reiches und teutscher Sitten,”[58] although the general
tenor of his essay, in reasonableness and balance, seemed to promise a
more independent, a more competent and felicitous performance.Kurz
expresses this opinion, which may have been derived from criticisms in
the eighteenth century journals.The _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_,
July 28, 1775, does not, however, take this view; but seems to be in the
novel a genuine exemplification of the author’s theories as previously
expressed.[59] The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[60] calls the book
didactic, a tract against certain essentially German follies.Merck, in
the _Teutscher Merkur_,[61] says the imitation of Sterne is quite too
obvious, though Blankenburg denies it.Among miscellaneous and anonymous works inspired directly by Sterne,
belongs undoubtedly “Die Geschichte meiner Reise nach Pirmont” (1773),
the author of which claims that it was written before Yorick was
translated or Jacobi published.He says he is not worthy to pack
Yorick’s bag or weave Jacobi’s arbor,[62] but the review of the
_Almanach der deutschen Musen_ evidently regards it as a product,
nevertheless, of Yorick’s impulse.Kuno Ridderhoff in his study of Frau
la Roche[63] says that the “Empfindsamkeit” of Rosalie in the first part
of “Rosaliens Briefe” is derived from Yorick.The “Leben, Thaten und
Meynungen des D. J. Pet.Menadie” (Halle, 1777-1781) is charged by the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ with attempt at Shandy-like
eccentricity of narrative and love of digression.[64]

One little volume, unmistakably produced under Yorick’s spell, is worthy
of particular mention because at its time it received from the reviewers
a more cordial welcome than was accorded to the rank and file of
Sentimental Journeys.It is “M . . ..” by E. A. A. von Göchhausen
(1740-1824), which was published at Eisenach, 1772, and was deemed
worthy of several later editions.Its dependence on Sterne is confessed
and obvious, sometimes apologetically and hesitatingly, sometimes
defiantly.The imitation of Sterne is strongest at the beginning, both
in outward form and subject-matter, and this measure of indebtedness
dwindles away steadily as the book advances.Göchhausen, as other
imitators, used at the outset a modish form, returned to it consciously
now and then when once under way, but when he actually had something to
say, a message of his own, found it impracticable or else forgot to
follow his model.The absurd title stands, of course, for “Meine Reisen” and the puerile
abbreviation as well as the reasons assigned for it, were intended to be
a Sterne-like jest, a pitiful one.Why Goedeke should suggest “Meine
Randglossen” is quite inexplicable, since Göchhausen himself in the very
first chapter indicates the real title.Beneath the enigmatical title
stands an alleged quotation from Shandy: “Ein Autor borgt, bettelt und
stiehlt so stark von dem andern, dass bey meiner Seele!die Originalität
fast so rar geworden ist als die Ehrlichkeit.”[65] The book itself, like
Sterne’s Journey, is divided into brief chapters unnumbered but named.As the author loses Yorick from sight, the chapters grow longer.Göchhausen has availed himself of an odd device to disarm
criticism,--a plan used once or twice by Schummel: occasionally when the
imitation is obvious, he repudiates the charge sarcastically, or
anticipates with irony the critics’ censure.For example, he gives
directions to his servant Pumper to pack for the journey; a reader
exclaims, “a portmanteau, Mr.Author, so that everything, even to that,
shall be just like Yorick,” and in the following passage the author
quarrels with the critics who allow no one to travel with a portmanteau,
because an English clergyman traveled with one.Pumper’s
misunderstanding of this objection is used as a farther ridicule of the
critics.When on the journey, the author converses with two poor
wandering monks, whose conversation, at any rate, is a witness to their
content, the whole being a legacy of the Lorenzo episode, and the author
entitles the chapter: “The members of the religious order, or, as some
critics will call it, a wretchedly unsuccessful imitation.” In the next
chapter, “Der Visitator” (pp.in which the author encounters
customs annoyances, the critic is again allowed to complain that
everything is stolen from Yorick, a protest which is answered by the
author quite naïvely, “Yorick journeyed, ate, drank; I do too.” In “Die
Pause” the author stands before the inn door and fancies that a number
of spies (Ausspäher) stand there waiting for him; he protests that
Yorick encountered beggars before the inn in Montreuil, a very different
sort of folk.On page 253 he exclaims, “für diesen schreibe ich dieses
Kapitel nicht und ich--beklage ihn!” Here a footnote suggests “Das
übrige des Diebstahls vid.Yorick’s Gefangenen.” Similarly when he calls
his servant his “La Fleur,” he converses with the critics about his
theft from Yorick.The book is opened by a would-be whimsical note, the guessing about the
name of the book.The dependence upon Sterne, suggested by the motto, is
clinched by reference to this quotation in the section “Apologie,” and
by the following chapter, which is entitled “Yorick.” The latter is the
most unequivocal and, withal, the most successful imitation of Yorick’s
manner which the volume offers.The author is sitting on a sofa reading
the Sentimental Journey, and the idea of such a trip is awakened in him.Someone knocks and the door is opened by the postman, as the narrator is
opening his “Lorenzodose,” and the story of the poor monk is touching
his heart now for the twentieth time as strongly as ever.The postman
asks postage on the letter as well as his own trivial fee.The author
counts over money, miscounts it, then in counting forgets all about it,
puts the money away and continues the reading of Yorick.The postman
interrupts him; the author grows impatient and says, “You want four
groschen?” and is inexplicably vexed at the honesty of the man who says
it is only three pfennigs for himself and the four groschen for the
post.Here is a direct following of the Lorenzo episode; caprice rules
his behavior toward an inferior, who is modest in his request.After the
incident, his spite, his head and his heart and his “ich” converse in
true Sterne fashion as to the advisability of his beginning to read
Yorick again.He reasons with himself concerning his conduct toward the
postman, then in an apostrophe to Yorick he condemns himself for failing
in this little test.This conversation occupies so much time that he
cannot run after the postman, but he resolves that nothing, not even the
fly that lights on his nose, shall bring him so far as to forget
wherefore his friend J . . . .sent him a “Lorenzodose.” And at the end
of the section there is a picture of the snuff-box with the lid open,
disclosing the letters of the word “Yorick.” The “Lorenzodose” is
mentioned later, and later still the author calms his indignation by
opening the box; he fortifies himself also by a look at the
treasure.[66]

Following this picture of the snuff-box is an open letter to “My dear
J . . .,” who, at the author’s request, had sent him on June 29th a
“Lorenzodose.” Jacobi’s accompanying words are given.The author
acknowledges the difficulty with which sometimes the self-conquest
demanded by allegiance to the sentimental symbol has been won.Yet, compared with some other imitations of the good Yorick, the volume
contains but a moderate amount of lavish sentiment.The servant Pumper
is a man of feeling, who grieves that the horses trod the dewdrops from
the blades of grass.Cast in the real Yorick mould is the scene in which
Pumper kills a marmot (Hamster); upon his master’s expostulation that
God created the little beast also, Pumper is touched, wipes the blood
off with his cuff and buries the animal with tenderness, indulging in a
pathetic soliloquy; the whole being a variant of Yorick’s ass episode.Marked with a similar vein of sentimentality is the narrator’s conduct
toward the poor wanderer with his heavy burden: the author asserts that
he has never eaten a roll, put on a white shirt, traveled in a
comfortable carriage, or been borne by a strong horse, without bemoaning
those who were less fortunately circumstanced.A similar and truly
Sterne-like triumph of feeling over convention is the traveler’s
insistence that Pumper shall ride with him inside the coach; seemingly a
point derived from Jacobi’s failure to be equally democratic.[67]

Sterne’s emphasis upon the machinery of his story-telling, especially
his distraught pretense at logical sequence in the ordering of his
material is here imitated.For example: near the close of a chapter the
author summons his servant Pumper, but since the chapter bore the title
“Der Brief” and the servant can neither read nor write a letter, he says
the latter has nothing to do in that chapter, but he is to be introduced
in the following one.Yet with Yorick’s inconsequence, the narrator is
led aside and exclaims at the end of this chapter, “But where is
Pumper?” with the answer, “Heaven and my readers know, it was to no
purpose that this chapter was so named (and perhaps this is not the last
one to which the title will be just as appropriate)”, and the next
chapter pursues the whimsical attempt, beginning “As to whether Pumper
will appear in this chapter, about that, dear reader, I am not really
sure myself.”

The whimsical, unconventional interposition of the reader, and the
author’s reasoning with him, a Sterne device, is employed so constantly
in the book as to become a wearying mannerism.Examples have already
been cited, additional ones are numerous: the fifth section is devoted
to such conversation with the reader concerning the work; later the
reader objects to the narrator’s drinking coffee without giving a
chapter about it; the reader is allowed to express his wonder as to what
the chapter is going to be because of the author’s leap; the reader
guesses where the author can be, when he begins to describe conditions
in the moon.The chapter “Der Einwurf” is occupied entirely with the
reader’s protest, and the last two sections are largely the record of
fancied conversations with various readers concerning the nature of the
book; here the author discloses himself.[68] Sterne-like whim is found
in the chapter “Die Nacht,” which consists of a single sentence: “Ich
schenke Ihnen diesen ganzen Zeitraum, denn ich habe ihn ruhig
verschlafen.” Similar Shandean eccentricity is illustrated by the
chapter entitled “Der Monolog,” which consists of four lines of dots,
and the question, “Didn’t you think all this too, my readers?”
Typographical eccentricity is observed also in the arrangement of the
conversation of the ladies A., B., C., D., etc., in the last chapter.Like Sterne, our author makes lists of things; probably inspired by
Yorick’s apostrophe to the “Sensorium” is our traveler’s appeal to the
spring of joy.The description of the fashion of walking observed in the
maid in the moon is reminiscent of a similar passage in Schummel’s
journey.Göchhausen’s own work, untrammeled by outside influence, is
considerable, largely a genial satire on critics and philosophers;
his stay in the moon is a kind of Utopian fancy.The literary journals accepted Göchhausen’s work as a Yorick imitation,
condemned it as such apologetically, but found much in the book worthy
of their praise.[69]

Probably the best known novel which adopts in considerable measure the
style of Tristram Shandy is Wezel’s once famous “Tobias Knaut,” the
“Lebensgeschichte Tobias Knauts des Weisen sonst Stammler genannt,
aus Familiennachrichten gesammelt.”[70] In this work the influence of
Fielding is felt parallel to that of Sterne.The historians of
literature all accord the book a high place among humorous efforts of
the period, crediting the author with wit, narrative ability, knowledge
of human nature and full consciousness of plan and purpose.[71] They
unite also in the opinion that “Tobias Knaut” places Wezel in the ranks
of Sterne imitators, but this can be accepted only guardedly, for in
part the novel must be regarded as a satire on “Empfindsamkeit” and
hence in some measure be classified as an opposing force to Sterne’s
dominion, especially to the distinctively German Sterne.That this
impulse, which later became the guiding principle of “Wilhelmine Arend,”
was already strong in “Tobias Knaut” is hinted at by Gervinus, but
passed over in silence by other writers.Kurz, following Wieland, who
reviewed the novel in his _Merkur_, finds that the influence of Sterne
was baneful.Other contemporary reviews deplored the imitation as
obscuring and stultifying the undeniable and genuinely original talents
of the author.[72]

A brief investigation of Wezel’s novel will easily demonstrate his
indebtedness to Sterne.Yet Wezel in his preface, anticipating the
charge of imitation, asserts that he had not read Shandy when “Tobias”
was begun.Possibly he intends this assertion as a whim, for he quotes
Tristram at some length.[73] This inconsistency is occasion for censure
on the part of the reviewers.Wezel’s story begins, like Shandy, “ab ovo,” and, in resemblance to
Sterne’s masterpiece, the connection between the condition of the child
before its birth and its subsequent life and character is insisted upon.The work is episodical and
digressive, but in a more extensive way than Shandy; the episodes in
Sterne’s novel are yet part and parcel of the story, infused with the
personality of the writer, and linked indissolubly to the little family
of originals whose sayings and doings are immortalized by Sterne.This
is not true of Wezel: his episodes and digressions are much more purely
extraneous in event, and nature of interest.The story of the new-found
son, which fills sixty-four pages, is like a story within a story, for
its connection with the Knaut family is very remote.This very story,
interpolated as it is, is itself again interrupted by a seven-page
digression concerning Tyrus, Alexander, Pipin and Charlemagne, which the
author states is taken from the one hundred and twenty-first chapter of
his “Lateinische Pneumatologie,”--a genuine Sternian pretense, reminding
one of the “Tristrapaedia.” Whimsicality of manner distinctly
reminiscent of Sterne is found in his mock-scientific catalogues or
lists of things, as in Chapter III, “Deduktionen, Dissertationen,
Argumentationen a priori und a posteriori,” and so on; plainly adapted
from Sterne’s idiosyncrasy of form is the advertisement which in large
red letters occupies the middle of a page in the twenty-first chapter of
the second volume, which reads as follows: “Dienst-freundliche Anzeige.Jedermann, der an ernsten Gesprächen keinen Gefallen findet, wird
freundschaftlich ersucht alle folgende Blätter, deren Inhalt einem
Gespräche ähnlich sieht, wohlbedächtig zu überschlagen, d.h.von dieser
Anzeige an gerechnet.Darauf denke ich, soll jedermanniglich vom 22.Absatze fahren können,--Cuique Suum.” The following page is blank: this
is closely akin to Sterne’s vagaries.Like Sterne, he makes promise of
chapter-subject.[74] Similarly dependent on Sterne’s example, is the
Fragment in Chapter VIII, Volume III, which breaks off suddenly under
the plea that the rest could not be found.Like Sterne, our author
satirizes detailed description in the excessive account of the
infinitesimals of personal discomfort after a carouse.[75] He makes also
obscure whimsical allusions, accompanied by typographical eccentricities
(I, p. 153).To be connected with the story of the Abbess of Andouillets
is the humor “Man leuterirte, appelirte--irte,--irte,--irte.”

The author’s perplexities in managing the composition of the book are
sketched in a way undoubtedly derived from Sterne,--for example, the
beginning of Chapter IX in Volume III is a lament over the difficulties
of chronicling what has happened during the preceding learned
disquisition.When Tobias in anger begins to beat his horse, this is
accompanied by the sighs of the author, a really audible one being put
in a footnote, the whole forming a whimsy of narrative style for which
Sterne must be held responsible.Similar to this is the author’s
statement (Chap.II), that Lucian, Swift, Pope, Wieland and
all the rest could not unite the characteristics which had just been
predicated of Selmann.Like Sterne, Wezel converses with the reader
about the way of telling the story, indulging[76] in a mock-serious line
of reasoning with meaningless Sternesque dashes.Further conversation
with the reader is found at the beginning of Chapter III in Volume I,
and in Chapter VIII of the first volume, he cries, “Wake up, ladies and
gentlemen,” and continues at some length a conversation with these
fancied personages about the progress of the book.Wezel in a few cases
adopted the worst feature of Sterne’s work and was guilty of bad taste
in precisely Yorick’s style: Tobias’s adventure with the so-called
soldier’s wife, after he has run away from home, is a case in point, but
the following adventure with the two maidens while Tobias is bathing in
the pool is distinctly suggestive of Fielding.Sterne’s indecent
suggestion is also followed in the hints at the possible occasion of the
Original’s aversion to women.A similar censure could be spoken
regarding the adventure in the tavern,[77] where the author hesitates on
the edge of grossness.Wezel joined other imitators of Yorick in using as a motif the
accidental interest of lost documents, or papers: here the poems of the
“Original,” left behind in the hotel, played their rôle in the tale.The treatment of the wandering boy by the kindly peasant is clearly an
imitation of Yorick’s famous visit in the rural cottage.A parallel to
Walter Shandy’s theory of the dependence of great events on trifles is
found in the story of the volume of Tacitus, which by chance suggested
the sleeping potion for Frau v. L., or that Tobias’s inability to take
off his hat with his right hand was influential on the boy’s future
life.This is a reminder of Tristram’s obliquity in his manner of
setting up his top.As in Shandy, there is a discussion about the
location of the soul.The character of Selmann is a compound of Yorick
and the elder Shandy, with a tinge of satiric exaggeration, meant to
chastise the thirst for “originals” and overwrought sentimentalism.His
generosity and sensitiveness to human pain is like Yorick.As a boy he
would empty his purse into the bosom of a poor man; but his daily life
was one round of Shandean speculation, largely about the relationships
of trivial things: for example, his yearly periods of investigating his
motives in inviting his neighbors Herr v.Wezel’s satire on the craze for originality is exemplified in the
account of the “Original” (Chap.II), who was cold when
others were hot, complained of not liking his soup because the plate was
not full, but who threw the contents of his coffee cup at the host
because it was filled to the brim, and trembled at the approach of a
woman.Selmann longs to meet such an original.Selmann also thinks he
has found an original in the inn-keeper who answers everything with
“Nein,” greatly to his own disadvantage, though it turns out later that
this was only a device planned by another character to gain advantage
over Selmann himself.So also, in the third volume, Selmann and Tobias
ride off in pursuit of a sentimental adventure, but the latter proves to
be merely a jest of the Captain at the expense of his sentimental
friend.Satire on sentimentalism is further unmistakable in the two
maidens, Adelheid and Kunigunde, who weep over a dead butterfly, and
write a lament over its demise.In jest, too, it is said that the
Captain made a “sentimental journey through the stables.” The author
converses with Ermindus, who seems to be a kind of Eugenius,
a convenient figure for reference, apostrophe, and appeal.The novelist
makes also, like Sterne, mock-pedantic allusions, once indeed making a
long citation from a learned Chinese book.An expression suggesting
Sterne is the oath taken “bey den Nachthemden aller Musen,”[78] and an
intentional inconsequence of narration, giving occasion to conversation
regarding the author’s control of his work, is the sudden passing over
of the six years which Tobias spent in Selmann’s house.[79]

In connection with Wezel’s occupation with Sterne and Sterne products in
Germany, it is interesting to consider his poem: “Die unvermuthete
Nachbarschaft.Ein Gespräch,” which was the second in a volume of three
poems entitled “Epistel an die deutschen Dichter,” the name of the first
poem, and published in Leipzig in 1775.This slight work is written for
the most part in couplets and covers twenty-three pages.Wezel
represents Doktor Young, the author of the gloomy “Night Thoughts” and
“Der gute Lacher,--Lorenz Sterne” as occupying positions side by side in
his book-case.This proximity gives rise to a conversation between the
two antipodal British authors: Sterne says:

  “Wir brauchen beide vielen Raum,
  Your Reverence viel zum Händeringen,
  Und meine Wenigkeit, zum Pfeifen, Tanzen, Singen.”

and later,

 .“Und will von Herzen gern der Thor der Thoren seyn;
  Jüngst that ich ernst: gleich hielt die
  Narrheit mich beym Rocke.Wo, rief sie, willst du hin,--Du!Du lachtest dich gesund.”

To Sterne’s further enunciation of this joyous theory of life, Young
naturally replies in characteristic terms, emphasizing life’s
evanescence and joy’s certain blight.But Sterne, though acknowledging
the transitoriness of life’s pleasures, denies Young’s deductions.Yorick’s conception of death is quite in contrast to Young’s picture and
one must admit that it has no justification in Sterne’s writings.On the
contrary, Yorick’s life was one long flight from the grim enemy.The
idea of death cherished by Asmus in his “Freund Hein,” the welcome
guest, seems rather the conception which Wezel thrusts on Sterne.Death
comes to Yorick in full dress, a youth, a Mercury:

  “Er thuts, er kommt zu mir, ‘Komm, guter Lorenz, flieh!’
  So ruft er auf mich zu.‘Dein Haus fängt an zu wanken,
  Die Mauern spalten sich; Gewölb und Balken schwanken,
  Was nuzt dir so ein Haus?.’”

so he takes the wreathèd cup, drinks joyfully, and follows death,
embracing him.“Das ist mein Tod, ich sehe keinen Knochen,
  Womit du ihn, gleich einem Zahnarzt, schmückst,
  Geschieht es heute noch, geschieht’s in wenig Wochen,
  Dass du, Gevatter Tod, nur meine Hände drückst?Ganz nach Bequemlichkeit!du bist mir zwar willkommen.”

The latter part of the poem contains a rather extended laudation of the
part played by sympathetic feeling in the conduct of life.That there would be those in Germany as in England, who saw in Sterne’s
works only a mine of vulgar suggestion, a relation sometimes delicate
and clever, sometimes bald and ugly, of the indelicate and sensual, is a
foregone conclusion.Undoubtedly some found in the general approbation
which was accorded Sterne’s books a sanction for forcing upon the public
the products of their own diseased imaginations.This pernicious influence of the English master is exemplified by
Wegener’s “Raritäten, ein hinterlassenes Werk des Küsters von
Rummelsberg.”[80] The first volume is dedicated to “Sebaldus Nothanker,”
and the long document claims for the author unusual distinction, in thus
foregoing the possibility of reward or favor, since he dedicates his
book to a fictitious personage.The idea of the book is to present
“merry observations” for every day in the year.With the end of the
fourth volume the author has reached March 17, and, according to the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_, the sixth volume includes May 22.The
present writer was unable to examine the last volume to discover whether
the year was rounded out in this way.The author claims to write “neither for surly Catos nor for those fond
of vulgar jests and smutty books,” but for those who will laugh.At the
close of his preface he confesses the source of his inspiration: “In
order to inspire myself with something of the spirit of a Sterne, I made
a decoction out of his writings and drank the same eagerly; indeed I
have burned the finest passages to powder, and then partaken of it with
warm English ale, but”--he had the insight and courtesy to add--“it
helped me just a little as it aids a lame man, if he steps in the
footprints of one who can walk nimbly.” The very nature of this author’s
dependence on Sterne excludes here any extended analysis of the
connection.The style is abrupt, full of affected gaiety and raillery,
conversational and journalistic.The stories, observations and
reflections, in prose and verse, represent one and all the ribaldry of
Sterne at its lowest ebb, as illustrated, for example, by the story of
the abbess of Andouillets, but without the charm and grace with which
that tale begins.The author copies Sterne in the tone of his
lucubrations; the material is drawn from other sources.In the first
volume, at any rate, his only direct indebtedness to Sterne is the
introduction of the Shandean theory of noses in the article for January
11.The pages also, sometimes strewn with stars and dashes, present a
somewhat Sternesque appearance.These volumes are reviewed in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[81]
with full appreciation of their pernicious influence, and with open
acknowledgment that their success demonstrates a pervision of taste in
the fatherland.The author of the “Litterarische Reise durch
Deutschland”[82] advises his sister, to whom his letters are directed,
to put her handkerchief before her mouth at the very mention of Wegener,
and fears that the very name has befouled his pen.A similar
condemnation is meted out in Wieland’s _Merkur_.[83]

A similar commentary on contemporary taste is obtained from a somewhat
similar collection of stories, “Der Geist der Romane im letzten Viertel
des 18ten Jahrhunderts,” Breslau and Hirschberg, 1788, in which the
author (S. G.claims to follow the spirit of the period and
gives six stories of revolting sensuality, with a thin whitewash of
teary sentimentalism.The pursuit of references to Yorick and direct appeals to his writings
in the German literary world of the century succeeding the era of his
great popularity would be a monstrous and fruitless task.Such
references in books, letters and periodicals multiply beyond possibility
of systematic study.One might take the works[84] of Friedrich Matthison
as a case in point.He visits the grave of Musäus, even as Tristram
Shandy sought for the resting-place of the two lovers in Lyons (III,
p.312); as he travels in Italy, he remarks that a certain visit would
have afforded Yorick’s “Empfindsamkeit” the finest material for an
Ash-Wednesday sermon (IV, p. 67).Sterne’s expressions are cited:
“Erdwasserball” for the earth (V, p.57), “Wo keine Pflanze, die da
nichts zu suchen hatte, eine bleibende Stäte fand” (V, p.302); two
farmsteads in the Tyrol are designated as “Nach dem Ideal Yoricks” (VI,
pp.He refers to the story of the abbess of Andouillets (VI,
64); he narrates (VIII, pp.203-4) an anecdote of Sterne which has just
been printed in the _Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_ (1769, p.Levade in Lausanne, who bore a striking resemblance to
Sterne (V, p.279), and refers to Yorick in other minor regards (VII,
158; VIII, pp.51, 77, and Briefe II, 76).Yet in spite of this evident
infatuation, Matthison’s account of his own travels cannot be classed as
an imitation of Yorick, but is purely objective, descriptive, without
search for humor or pathos, with no introduction of personalities save
friends and celebrities.Heinse alluded to Sterne frequently in his
letters to Gleim (1770-1771),[85] but after August 23, 1771, Sterne
vanished from his fund of allusion, though the correspondence lasts
until 1802, a fact of significance in dating the German enthusiasm for
Sterne and the German knowledge of Shandy from the publication of the
Sentimental Journey, and likewise an indication of the insecurity of
Yorick’s personal hold.Miscellaneous allusions to Sterne, illustrating the magnitude and
duration of his popularity, may not be without interest: Kästner
“Vermischte Schriften,” II, p.134 (Steckenpferd); Lenz “Gesammelte
Werke,” Berlin, 1828, Vol.312; letter from the Duchess Amalie,
August 2, 1779, in “Briefe an und von Merck,” Darmstadt, 1838; letter of
Caroline Herder to Knebel, April 2, 1799, in “K. L.von Knebel’s
Literarischer Nachlass,” Leipzig, 1835, p.324 (Yorick’s “heiliges
Sensorium”); a rather unfavorable but apologetic criticism of Shandy in
the “Hinterlassene Schriften” of Charlotta Sophia Sidonia Seidelinn,
Nürnberg, 1793, p.227; “Schiller’s Briefe,” edited by Fritz Jonas, I,
pp.136, 239; in Hamann’s letters, “Leben und Schriften,” edited by Dr.C. H. Gildermeister, Gotha, 1875, II, p.16,
163; in C. L. Jünger’s “Anlage zu einem Familiengespräch über die
Physiognomik” in _Deutsches Museum_, II, pp.781-809, where the French
barber who proposes to dip Yorick’s wig in the sea is taken as a type of
exaggeration.And a similar reference is found in Wieland’s _Merkur_,
1799, I, p.15: Yorick’s Sensorium is again cited, _Merkur_, 1791, II,
p. 95.Other references in the _Merkur_ are: 1774, III, p.52; 1791, I,
p.19-21; _Deutsches Museum_, IV, pp.66, 462; _Neuer Gelehrter Mercurius_, Altona, 1773, August 19, in review
of Goethe’s “Götz;” _Almanach der deutschen Musen_, 1771, p. 93.And
thus the references scatter themselves down the decades.“Das Wörtlein
Und,” by F. A. Krummacher (Duisberg und Essen, 1811), bore a motto taken
from the Koran, and contained the story of Uncle Toby and the fly with a
personal application, and Yorick’s division of travelers is copied
bodily and applied to critics.Friedrich Hebbel, probably in 1828, gave
his Newfoundland dog the name of Yorick-Sterne-Monarch.[86] Yorick is
familiarly mentioned in Wilhelm Raabe’s “Chronik der Sperlingsgasse”
(1857), and in Ernst von Wolzogen’s “Der Dornenweg,” two characters
address one another in Yorick similes.Indeed, in the summer of 1902,
a Berlin newspaper was publishing “Eine Empfindsame Reise in einem
Automobile.”[87]

Musäus is named as an imitator of Sterne by Koberstein, and Erich
Schmidt implies in his “Richardson, Rousseau und Goethe,” that he
followed Sterne in his “Grandison der Zweite,” which could hardly be
possible, for “Grandison der Zweite” was first published in 1760, and
was probably written during 1759, that is, before Sterne had published
Tristram Shandy.Adolph von Knigge is also mentioned by Koberstein as a
follower of Sterne, and Baker includes Knigge’s “Reise nach
Braunschweig” and “Briefe auf einer Reise aus Lothringen” in his list.Their connection with Sterne cannot be designated as other than remote;
the former is a merry vagabond story, reminding one much more of the
tavern and way-faring adventures in Fielding and Smollett, and
suggesting Sterne only in the constant conversation with the reader
about the progress of the book and the mechanism of its construction.One example of the hobby-horse idea in this narration may perhaps be
traced to Sterne.The “Briefe auf einer Reise aus Lothringen” has even
less connection; it shares only in the increase of interest in personal
accounts of travel.Knigge’s novels, “Peter Claus” and “Der Roman meines
Lebens,” are decidedly not imitations of Sterne; a clue to the character
of the former may be obtained from the fact that it was translated into
English as “The German Gil Blas.” “Der Roman meines Lebens” is a typical
eighteenth century love-story written in letters, with numerous
characters, various intrigues and unexpected adventures; indeed, a part
of the plot, involving the abduction of one of the characters, reminds
one of “Clarissa Harlowe.” Sterne is, however, incidentally mentioned in
both books, is quoted in “Peter Claus” (Chapter VI, Vol.II), and Walter
Shandy’s theory of Christian names is cited in “Der Roman meines
Lebens.”[88] That Knigge had no sympathy with exaggerated sentimentalism
is seen in a passage in his “Umgang mit Menschen.”[89] Knigge admired
and appreciated the real Sterne and speaks in his “Ueber Schriftsteller
und Schriftstellerei”[90] of Yorick’s sharpening observation regarding
the little but yet important traits of character.Moritz August von Thümmel in his famous “Reise in die mittäglichen
Provinzen von Frankreich” adopted Sterne’s general idea of sentimental
journeying, shorn largely of the capriciousness and whimsicality which
marked Sterne’s pilgrimage.He followed Sterne also in driving the
sensuous to the borderland of the sensual.Hippel’s novels, “Lebensläufe nach aufsteigender Linie” and “Kreuz und
Querzüge des Ritters A. bis Z.” were purely Shandean products in which a
humor unmistakably imitated from Sterne struggles rather unsuccessfully
with pedagogical seriousness.Jean Paul was undoubtedly indebted to
Sterne for a part of his literary equipment, and his works afford proof
both of his occupation with Sterne’s writings and its effect upon his
own.A study of Hippel’s “Lebensläufe” in connection with both Sterne
and Jean Paul was suggested but a few years after Hippel’s death by a
reviewer in the _Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_[91] as a
fruitful topic for investigation.A detailed, minute study of von
Thümmel, Hippel and Jean Paul[92] in connection with the English master
is purposed as a continuation of the present essay.Heine’s pictures of
travel, too, have something of Sterne in them.[Footnote 1: _Quellen und Forschungen_, II, p. 27.][Footnote 2: Jacobi remarked, in his preface to the “Winterreise”
    in the edition of 1807, that this section, “Der Taubenschlag” is
    not to be reckoned as bearing the trace of the then condemned
    “Empfindeley,” for many authors, ancient and modern, have taken up
    the cause of animals against man; yet Sterne is probably the
    source of Jacobi’s expression of his feeling.][Footnote 3: XI, 2, pp.[Footnote 4: For reviews of the “Sommerreise” see _Allg.deutsche

    Sentimental Journey which was re-issued in four volumes, Hamburg
    and Bremen, 1769, whereas the edition was practically identical
    with the previous one, and the two added volumes were those of
    Stevenson’s continuation.Longo calls Sterne’s Eliza “Elisha”
    (p.28) and Tristram’s father becomes Sir Walter Shandy (p.37),
    an unwarranted exaltation of the retired merchant.][Footnote 6: Review in the _Jenaische Zeitungen von Gel.Sachen_]

OPPOSITION TO STERNE AND HIS TYPE OF SENTIMENTALISM


Sterne’s influence in Germany lived its own life, and gradually and
imperceptibly died out of letters, as an actuating principle.Yet its
dominion was not achieved without some measure of opposition.The
sweeping condemnation which the soberer critics heaped upon the
incapacities of his imitators has been exemplified in the accounts
already given of Schummel, Bock and others.It would be interesting to
follow a little more closely this current of antagonism.The tone of
protest was largely directed, the edge of satire was chiefly whetted,
against the misunderstanding adaptation of Yorick’s ways of thinking and
writing, and only here and there were voices raised to detract in any
way from the genius of Sterne.He never suffered in Germany such an
eclipse of fame as was his fate in England.He was to the end of the
chapter a recognized prophet, an uplifter and leader.The far-seeing,
clear-minded critics, as Lessing, Goethe and Herder, expressed
themselves quite unequivocally in this regard, and there was later no
withdrawal of former appreciation.Indeed, Goethe’s significant words
already quoted came from the last years of his life, when the new
century had learned to smile almost incredulously at the relation of a
bygone folly.In the very heyday of Sterne’s popularity, 1772, a critic of Wieland’s
“Diogenes” in the _Auserlesene Bibliothek der neuesten deutschen
Litteratur_[1] bewails Wieland’s imitation of Yorick, whom the critic
deems a far inferior writer, “Sterne, whose works will disappear, while
Wieland’s masterpieces are still the pleasure of latest posterity.” This
review of “Diogenes” is, perhaps, rather more an exaggerated compliment
to Wieland than a studied blow at Sterne, and this thought is recognized
by the reviewer in the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_,[2] who
designates the compliment as “dubious” and “insulting,” especially in
view of Wieland’s own personal esteem for Sterne.Yet these words, even
as a relative depreciation of Sterne during the period of his most
universal popularity, are not insignificant.Heinrich Leopold Wagner,
a tutor at Saarbrücken, in 1770, records that one member of a reading
club which he had founded “regarded his taste as insulted because I sent
him “Yorick’s Empfindsame Reise.”[3] But Wagner regarded this instance
as a proof of Saarbrücken ignorance, stupidity and lack of taste; hence
the incident is but a wavering testimony when one seeks to determine the
amount and nature of opposition to Yorick.We find another derogatory fling at Sterne himself and a regret at the
extent of his influence in an anonymous book entitled “Betrachtungen
über die englischen Dichter,”[4] published at the end of the great
Yorick decade.The author compares Sterne most unfavorably with Addison:
“If the humor of the _Spectator_ and _Tatler_ be set off against the
digressive whimsicality of Sterne,” he says, “it is, as if one of the
Graces stood beside a Bacchante.And yet the pampered taste of the
present day takes more pleasure in a Yorick than in an Addison.” But a
reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[5] discounts this
author’s criticisms of men of established fame, such as Shakespeare,
Swift, Yorick, and suggests youth, or brief acquaintance with English
literature, as occasion for his inadequate judgments.Indeed, Yorick
disciples were quick to resent any shadow cast upon his name.Thus the
remark in a letter printed in the _Deutsches Museum_ that Asmus was the
German Yorick “only a better moral character,” called forth a long
article in the same periodical for September, 1779, by L. H. N.,[6]
vigorously defending Sterne as a man and a writer.The greatness of his
human heart and the breadth and depth of his sympathies are given as the
unanswerable proofs of his moral worth.This defense is vehemently
seconded in the same magazine by Joseph von Retzer.The one great opponent of the whole sentimental tendency, whose censure
of Sterne’s disciples involved also a denunciation of the master
himself, was the Göttingen professor, Georg Christopher Lichtenberg.[7]
In his inner nature Lichtenberg had much in common with Sterne and
Sterne’s imitators in Germany, with the whole ecstatic, eccentric
movement of the time.Julian Schmidt[8] says: “So much is sure, at any
rate, that the greatest adversary of the new literature was of one flesh
and blood with it.”[9] But his period of residence in England shortly
after Sterne’s death and his association then and afterwards with
Englishmen of eminence render his attitude toward Sterne in large
measure an English one, and make an idealization either of the man or of
his work impossible for him.The contradiction between the greatness of heart evinced in Sterne’s
novels and the narrow selfishness of the author himself is repeatedly
noted by Lichtenberg.His knowledge of Sterne’s character was derived
from acquaintance with many of Yorick’s intimate friends in London.In
“Beobachtungen über den Menschen,” he says: “I can’t help smiling when
the good souls who read Sterne with tears of rapture in their eyes fancy
that he is mirroring himself in his book.Sterne’s simplicity, his warm
heart, over-flowing with feeling, his soul, sympathizing with everything
good and noble, and all the other expressions, whatever they may be; and
the sigh ‘Alas, poor Yorick,’ which expresses everything at once--have
become proverbial among us Germans. . . .Yorick was a crawling
parasite, a flatterer of the great, an unendurable burr on the clothing
of those upon whom he had determined to sponge!”[10]

In “Timorus” he calls Sterne “ein scandalum Ecclesiae”;[11] he doubts
the reality of Sterne’s nobler emotions and condemns him as a clever
juggler with words, who by artful manipulation of certain devices
aroused in us sympathy, and he snatches away the mask of loving, hearty
sympathy and discloses the grinning mountebank.With keen insight into
Sterne’s mind and method, he lays down a law by which, he says, it is
always possible to discover whether the author of a touching passage has
really been moved himself, or has merely with astute knowledge of the
human heart drawn our tears by a sly choice of touching features.[12]

Akin to this is the following passage in which the author is
unquestionably thinking of Sterne, although he does not mention him:
“A heart ever full of kindly feeling is the greatest gift which Heaven
can bestow; on the other hand, the itching to keep scribbling about it,
and to fancy oneself great in this scribbling is one of the greatest
punishments which can be inflicted upon one who writes.”[13] He exposes
the heartlessness of Sterne’s pretended sympathy: “A three groschen
piece is ever better than a tear,”[14] and “sympathy is a poor kind of
alms-giving,”[15] are obviously thoughts suggested by Yorick’s
sentimentalism.[16]

The folly of the “Lorenzodosen” is several times mentioned with open or
covert ridicule[17] and the imitators of Sterne are repeatedly told the
fruitlessness of their endeavor and the absurdity of their
accomplishment.[18] His “Vorschlag zu einem Orbis Pictus für deutsche
dramatische Schriftsteller, Romanendichter und Schauspieler”[19] is a
satire on the lack of originality among those who boasted of it, and
sought to win attention through pure eccentricities.The Fragments[20] are concerned, as the editors say, with an evil of the
literature in those days, the period of the Sentimentalists and the
“Kraftgenies.” Among the seven fragments may be noted: “Lorenzo
Eschenheimers empfindsame Reise nach Laputa,” a clever satirical sketch
in the manner of Swift, bitterly castigating that of which the English
people claim to be the discoverers (sentimental journeying) and the
Germans think themselves the improvers.In “Bittschrift der
Wahnsinnigen” and “Parakletor” the unwholesome literary tendencies of
the age are further satirized.His brief essay, “Ueber die
Vornamen,”[21] is confessedly suggested by Sterne and the sketch “Dass
du auf dem Blockberg wärst,”[22] with its mention of the green book
entitled “Echte deutsche Flüche und Verwünschungen für alle Stände,” is
manifestly to be connected in its genesis with Sterne’s famous
collection of oaths.[23] Lichtenberg’s comparison of Sterne and Fielding
is familiar and significant.[24] “Aus Lichtenbergs Nachlass: Aufsätze,
Gedichte, Tagebuchblätter, Briefe,” edited by Albert Leitzmann,[25]
contains additional mention of Sterne.The name of Helfreich Peter Sturz may well be coupled with that of
Lichtenberg, as an opponent of the Sterne cult and its German
distortions, for his information and point of view were likewise drawn
direct from English sources.Sturz accompanied King Christian VII of
Denmark on his journey to France and England, which lasted from May 6,
1768, to January 14, 1769[26]; hence his stay in England falls in a time
but a few months after Sterne’s death (March 18, 1768), when the
ungrateful metropolis was yet redolent of the late lion’s wit and humor.Sturz was an accomplished linguist and a complete master of English,
hence found it easy to associate with Englishmen of distinction whom he
was privileged to meet through the favor of his royal patron.He became
acquainted with Garrick, who was one of Sterne’s intimate friends, and
from him Sturz learned much of Yorick, especially that more wholesome
revulsion of feeling against Sterne’s obscenities and looseness of
speech, which set in on English soil as soon as the potent personality
of the author himself had ceased to compel silence and blind opinion.England began to wonder at its own infatuation, and, gaining
perspective, to view the writings of Sterne in a more rational light.Into the first spread of this reaction Sturz was introduced, and the
estimate of Sterne which he carried away with him was undoubtedly
 by it.In his second letter written to the _Deutsches Museum_
and dated August 24, 1768, but strangely not printed till April,
1777,[27] he quotes Garrick with reference to Sterne, a notable word of
personal censure, coming in the Germany of that decade, when Yorick’s
admirers were most vehement in their claims.Garrick called him “a lewd
companion, who was more loose in his intercourse than in his writings
and generally drove all ladies away by his obscenities.”[28] Sturz adds
that all his acquaintances asserted that Sterne’s moral character went
through a process of disintegration in London.In the _Deutsches Museum_ for July, 1776, Sturz printed a poem entitled
“Die Mode,” in which he treats of the slavery of fashion and in several
stanzas deprecates the influence of Yorick.[29]

  “Und so schwingt sich, zum Genie erklärt,
  Strephon kühn auf Yorick’s Steckenpferd.Trabt mäandrisch über Berg und Auen,
  Reist empfindsam durch sein Dorfgebiet,
  Oder singt die Jugend zu erbauen
  Ganz Gefühl dem Gartengott ein Lied.Gott der Gärten, stöhnt die Bürgerin,
  Lächle gütig, Rasen und Schasmin
  Haucht Gerüche!Fliehet Handlungssorgen,
  Dass mein Liebster heute noch in Ruh
  Sein Mark-Einsaz-Lomber spiele--Morgen,
  Schliessen wir die Unglücksbude zu!”

A passage at the end of the appendix to the twelfth Reisebrief is
further indication of his opposition to and his contempt for the frenzy
of German sentimentalism.The poems of Goeckingk contain allusions[30] to Sterne, to be sure
partly indistinctive and insignificant, which, however, tend in the main
to a ridicule of the Yorick cult and place their author ultimately among
the satirical opponents of sentimentalism.In the “Epistel an Goldhagen
in Petershage,” 1771, he writes:

  “Doch geb ich wohl zu überlegen,
  Was für den Weisen besser sey:
  Die Welt wie Yorick mit zu nehmen?Nach Königen, wie Diogen,
  Sich keinen Fuss breit zu bequemen,”--

a query which suggests the hesitant point of view relative to the
advantage of Yorick’s excess of universal sympathy.In “Will auch ’n
Genie werden” the poet steps out more unmistakably as an adversary of
the movement and as a skeptical observer of the exercise of Yorick-like
sympathy.“Doch, ich Patronus, merkt das wohl,
    Geh, im zerrissnen Kittel,
  Hab’ aber alle Taschen voll
    Yorickischer Capittel.Doch lass’ ich, wenn mir’s Kurzweil schafft,
    Die Hülfe fleh’nden Armen
  Durch meinen Schweitzer, Peter Kraft,
    Zerprügeln ohn’ Erbarmen.”

Goeckingk openly satirizes the sentimental cult in the poem “Der
Empfindsame”

  “Herr Mops, der um das dritte Wort
  Empfindsamkeit im Munde führet,
  Und wenn ein Grashalm ihm verdorrt,
  Gleich einen Thränenstrom verlieret--
     .Mit meinem Weibchen thut er schier
  Gleich so bekannt wie ein Franzose;
  All’ Augenblicke bot er ihr
  Toback aus eines Bettlers Dose
  Mit dem, am Zaun in tiefem Schlaf
  Er einen Tausch wie Yorik traf.Der Unempfindsamkeit zum Hohn
  Hielt er auf eine Mück’ im Glase
  Beweglich einen Leichsermon,
  Purrt’ eine Flieg’ ihm an der Nase,
  Macht’ er das Fenster auf, und sprach:
  Zieh Oheim Toby’s Fliege nach!Durch Mops ist warlich meine Magd
  Nicht mehr bey Trost, nicht mehr bey Sinnen
  So sehr hat ihr sein Lob behagt,
  Dass sie empfindsam allen Spinnen
  Zu meinem Hause, frank und frey
  Verstattet ihre Weberey.Er trat mein Hündchen auf das Bein,
  Hilf Himmel!Welch’ ein Lamentiren!Es hätte mögen einen Stein
  Der Strasse zum Erbarmen rühren,
  Auch wedelt’ ihm in einem Nu
  Das Hündgen schon Vergebung zu.Hündchen, du beschämst mich sehr,
  Denn dass mir Mops von meinem Leben
  Drey Stunden stahl, wie schwer, wie schwer,
  Wird’s halten, das ihm zu vergeben?Denn Spinnen werden oben ein
  Wohl gar noch meine Mörder seyn.”

This poem is a rather successful bit of ridicule cast on the
over-sentimental who sought to follow Yorick’s foot-prints.The other allusions to Sterne[31] are concerned with his hobby-horse
idea, for this seems to gain the poet’s approbation and to have no share
in his censure.The dangers of overwrought sentimentality, of heedless surrender to the
emotions and reveling in their exercise,--perils to whose magnitude
Sterne so largely contributed--were grasped by saner minds, and
energetic protest was entered against such degradation of mind and
futile expenditure of feeling.Joachim Heinrich Campe, the pedagogical theorist, published in 1779[32]
a brochure, “Ueber Empfindsamkeit und Empfindelei in pädagogischer
Hinsicht,” in which he deprecates the tendency of “Empfindsamkeit” to
degenerate into “Empfindelei,” and explains at some length the
deleterious effects of an unbridled “Empfindsamkeit” and an unrestrained
outpouring of sympathetic emotions which finds no actual expression, no
relief in deeds.The substance of this warning essay is repeated, often
word for word, but considerably amplified with new material, and
rendered more convincing by increased breadth of outlook and
positiveness of assertion, the fruit of six years of observation and
reflection, as part of a treatise, entitled, “Von der nöthigen Sorge für
die Erhaltung des Gleichgewichts unter den menschlichen Kräften:
Besondere Warnung vor dem Modefehler die Empfindsamkeit zu überspannen.”
It is in the third volume of the “Allgemeine Revision des gesammten
Schul- und Erziehungswesens.”[33] The differentiation between
“Empfindsamkeit” and “Empfindelei” is again and more accessibly repeated
in Campe’s later work, “Ueber die Reinigung und Bereicherung der
deutschen Sprache.”[34] In the second form of this essay (1785) Campe
speaks of the sentimental fever as an epidemic by no means entirely
cured.His analysis of “Empfindsamkeit” is briefly as follows: “Empfindsamkeit
ist die Empfänglichkeit zu Empfindnissen, in denen etwas Sittliches d.i.Freude oder Schmerz über etwas sittlich Gutes oder sittlich Böses, ist;”
yet in common use the term is applied only to a certain high degree of
such susceptibility.This sensitiveness is either in harmony or discord
with the other powers of the body, especially with the reason: if
equilibrium is maintained, this sensitiveness is a fair, worthy,
beneficent capacity (Fähigkeit); if exalted over other forces, it
becomes to the individual and to society the most destructive and
baneful gift which refinement and culture may bestow.Campe proposes to
limit the use of the word “Empfindsamkeit” to the justly proportioned
manifestation of this susceptibility; the irrational, exaggerated
development he would designate “überspannte Empfindsamkeit.”
“Empfindelei,” he says, “ist Empfindsamkeit, die sich auf eine
kleinliche alberne, vernunftlose und lächerliche Weise, also da äussert,
wo sie nicht hingehörte.” Campe goes yet further in his distinctions and
invents the monstrous word, “Empfindsamlichkeit” for the sentimentality
which is superficial, affected, sham (geheuchelte).Campe’s newly coined
word was never accepted, and in spite of his own efforts and those of
others to honor the word “Empfindsamkeit” and restrict it to the
commendable exercise of human sympathy, the opposite process was
victorious and “Empfindsamkeit,” maligned and scorned, came to mean
almost exclusively, unless distinctly modified, both what Campe
designates as “überspannte Empfindsamkeit” and “Empfindelei,” and also
the absurd hypocrisy of the emotions which he seeks to cover with his
new word.Campe’s farther consideration contains a synopsis of method
for distinguishing “Empfindsamkeit” from “Empfindelei:” in the first
place through the manner of their incitement,--the former is natural,
the latter is fantastic, working without sense of the natural properties
of things.In this connection he instances as examples, Yorick’s feeling
of shame after his heartless and wilful treatment of Father Lorenzo,
and, in contrast with this, the shallowness of Sterne’s imitators who
whimpered over the death of a violet, and stretched out their arms and
threw kisses to the moon and stars.In the second place they are
distinguished in the manner of their expression: “Empfindsamkeit” is
“secret, unpretentious, laconic and serious;” the latter attracts
attention, is theatrical, voluble, whining, vain.Thirdly, they are
known by their fruits, in the one case by deeds, in the other by shallow
pretension.In the latter part of his volume, Campe treats the problem
of preventing the perverted form of sensibility by educative endeavor.The word “Empfindsamkeit” was afterwards used sometimes simply as an
equivalent of “Empfindung,” or sensation, without implication of the
manner of sensing: for example one finds in the _Morgenblatt_[35] a poem
named “Empfindsamkeiten am Rheinfalle vom Felsen der Galerie
abgeschrieben.” In the poem various travelers are made to express their
thoughts in view of the waterfall.A poet cries, “Ye gods, what a hell
of waters;” a tradesman, “away with the rock;” a Briton complains of the
“confounded noise,” and so on.It is plain that the word suffered a
generalization of meaning.A poetical expression of Campe’s main message is found in a book called
“Winterzeitvertreib eines königlichen preussischen Offiziers.”[36]
A poem entitled “Das empfindsame Herz” (p.210) has the following lines:

  “Freund, ein empfindsames Herz ist nicht für diese Welt,
  Von Schelmen wird’s verlacht, von Thoren wirds geprellt,
  Doch üb’ im Stillen das, was seine Stimme spricht.Dein Lohn ist dir gewiss, nur hier auf Erden nicht.”

In a similar vein of protest is the letter of G. Hartmann[37] to Denis,
dated Tübingen, February 10, 1773, in which the writer condemns the
affected sentimentalism of Jacobi and others as damaging to morals.“O best teacher,” he pleads with Denis, “continue to represent these
performances as unworthy.”

Möser in his “Patriotische Phantasien”[38] represents himself as
replying to a maid-in-waiting who writes in distress about her young
mistress, because the latter is suffering from “epidemic”
sentimentalism, and is absurdly unreasonable in her practical incapacity
and her surrender to her feelings.Möser’s sound advice is the
substitution of genuine emotion.The whole section is entitled “Für die
Empfindsamen.”

Knigge, in his “Umgang mit Menschen,” plainly has those Germans in mind
who saw in Uncle Toby’s treatment of the fly an incentive to
unreasonable emphasis upon the relations between man and the animal
world, when, in the chapter on the treatment of animals, he protests
against the silly, childish enthusiasm of those who cannot see a hen
killed, but partake of fowl greedily on the table, or who passionately
open the window for a fly.[39] A work was also translated from the
French of Mistelet, which dealt with the problem of “Empfindsamkeit:”
it was entitled “Ueber die Empfindsamkeit in Rücksicht auf das Drama,
die Romane und die Erziehung.”[40] An article condemning exaggerated
sentimentality was published in the _Deutsches Museum_ for February,
1783, under the title “Etwas über deutsche Empfindsamkeit.”

Goethe’s “Der Triumph der Empfindsamkeit” is a merry satire on the
sentimental movement, but is not to be connected directly with Sterne,
since Goethe is more particularly concerned with the petty imitators of
his own “Werther.” Baumgartner in his Life of Goethe asserts that
Sterne’s Sentimental Journey was one of the books found inside the
ridiculous doll which the love-sick Prince Oronaro took about with him.This is not a necessary interpretation, for Andrason, when he took up
the first book, exclaimed merely “Empfindsamkeiten,” and, as Strehlke
observes,[41] it is not necessary here to think of a single work,
because the term was probably used in a general way, referring possibly
to a number of then popular imitations.The satires on “Empfindsamkeit” began to grow numerous at the end of the
seventies and the beginning of the eighties, so that the _Allgemeine
Litteratur-Zeitung_, in October, 1785, feels justified in remarking that
such attempts are gradually growing as numerous as the “Empfindsame
Romane” themselves, and wishes, “so may they rot together in a
grave of oblivion.”[42] Anton Reiser, the hero of Karl Philipp
Moritz’sautobiographical novel (Berlin, 1785-90), begins a satire on
affected sentimentalism, which was to bring shafts of ridicule to bear
on the popular sham, and to throw appreciative light on the real
manifestation of genuine feeling.[43] A kindred satire was “Die
Geschichte eines Genies,” Leipzig, 1780, two volumes, in which the
prevailing fashion of digression is incidentally satirized.[44]

The most extensive satire on the sentimental movement, and most vehement
protest against its excesses is the four volume novel, “Der
Empfindsame,”[45] published anonymously in Erfurt, 1781-3, but
acknowledged in the introduction to the fourth volume by its author,
Christian Friedrich Timme.He had already published one novel in which
he exemplified in some measure characteristics of the novelists whom he
later sought to condemn and satirize, that is, this first novel,
“Faramond’s Familiengeschichte,”[46] is digressive and episodical.“Der
Empfindsame” is much too bulky to be really effective as a satire; the
reiteration of satirical jibes, the repetition of satirical motifs
slightly varied, or thinly veiled, recoil upon the force of the work
itself and injure the effect.The maintenance of a single satire through
the thirteen to fourteen hundred pages which four such volumes contain
is a Herculean task which we can associate only with a genius like
Cervantes.Then, too, Timme is an excellent narrator, and his original
purpose is constantly obscured by his own interest and the reader’s
interest in Timme’s own story, in his original creations, in the variety
of his characters.These obtrude upon the original aim of the book and
absorb the action of the story in such a measure that Timme often for
whole chapters and sections seems to forget entirely the convention of
his outsetting.His attack is threefold, the centers of his opposition being “Werther,”
“Siegwart” and Sterne, as represented by their followers and imitators.But the campaign is so simple, and the satirist has been to such trouble
to label with care the direction of his own blows, that it is not
difficult to separate the thrusts intended for each of his foes.Timme’s initial purpose is easily illustrated by reference to his first
chapter, where his point of view is compactly put and the soundness of
his critical judgment and the forcefulness of his satirical bent are
unequivocally demonstrated: This chapter, which, as he says, “may serve
instead of preface and introduction,” is really both, for the narrative
really begins only in the second chapter.“Every nation, every age,”
he says, “has its own doll as a plaything for its children, and
sentimentality (Empfindsamkeit) is ours.” Then with lightness and grace,
coupled with unquestionable critical acumen, he traces briefly the
growth of “Empfindsamkeit” in Germany.“Kaum war der liebenswürdige
Sterne auf sein Steckenpferd gestiegen, und hatte es uns vorgeritten;
so versammelten sich wie gewöhnlich in Teutschland alle Jungen an ihn
herum, hingen sich an ihn, oder schnizten sich sein Steckenpferd in der
Geschwindigkeit nach, oder brachen Stecken vom nächsten Zaun oder rissen
aus einem Reissigbündel den ersten besten Prügel, setzten sich darauf
und ritten mit einer solchen Wut hinter ihm drein, dass sie einen
Luftwirbel veranlassten, der alles, was ihm zu nahe kam, wie ein
reissender Strom mit sich fortris, wär es nur unter den Jungen
geblieben, so hätte es noch sein mögen; aber unglücklicherweise fanden
auch Männer Geschmack an dem artigen Spielchen, sprangen vom ihrem Weg
ab und ritten mit Stok und Degen und Amtsperüken unter den Knaben
einher.Freilich erreichte keiner seinen Meister, den sie sehr bald aus
dem Gesicht verloren, und nun die possirlichsten Sprünge von der Welt
machen und doch bildet sich jeder der Affen ein, er reite so schön wie
der Yorick.”[47]

This lively description of Sterne’s part in this uprising is, perhaps,
the best brief characterization of the phenomenon and is all the more
significant as coming from the pen of a contemporary, and written only
about a decade after the inception of the sentimental movement as
influenced and furthered by the translation of the Sentimental Journey.It represents a remarkable critical insight into contemporaneous
literary movements, the rarest of all critical gifts, but it has been
overlooked by investigators who have sought and borrowed brief words to
characterize the epoch.[48]

The contribution of “Werther” and “Siegwart” to the sentimental frenzy
are even as succinctly and graphically designated; the latter book,
published in 1776, is held responsible for a recrudescence of the
phenomenon, because it gave a new direction, a new tone to the faltering
outbursts of Sterne’s followers and indicated a more comprehensible and
hence more efficient, outlet for their sentimentalism.Now again, “every
nook resounded with the whining sentimentality, with sighs, kisses,
forget-me-nots, moonshine, tears and ecstasies;” those hearts excited by
Yorick’s gospel, gropingly endeavoring to find an outlet for their own
emotions which, in their opinion were characteristic of their arouser
and stimulator, found through “Siegwart” a solution of their problem,
a relief for their emotional excess.Timme insists that his attack is only on Yorick’s mistaken followers and
not on Sterne himself.He contrasts the man and his imitators at the
outset sharply by comments on a quotation from the novel, “Fragmente zur
Geschichte der Zärtlichkeit”[49] as typifying the outcry of these petty
imitators against the heartlessness of their misunderstanding
critics,--“Sanfter, dultender Yorick,” he cries, “das war nicht deine
Sprache!Du priesest dich nicht mit einer pharisäischen
Selbstgenügsamkeit und schimpftest nicht auf die, die dir nicht ähnlich
waren, ‘Doch!sprachst Du am Grabe Lorenzos, doch ich bin so weichherzig
wie ein Weib, aber ich bitte die Welt nicht zu lachen, sondern mich zu
bedauern!’ Ruhe deinem Staube, sanfter, liebevoller Dulter!und nur
einen Funken deines Geistes deinen Affen.”[50] He writes not for the
“gentle, tender souls on whom the spirit of Yorick rests,”[51] for those
whose feelings are easily aroused and who make quick emotional return,
who love and do the good, the beautiful, the noble; but for those who
“bei dem wonnigen Wehen und Anhauchen der Gottheithaltenden Natur, in
huldigem Liebessinn und himmelsüssem Frohsein dahin schmelzt.die ihr
vom Sang der Liebe, von Mondschein und Tränen euch nährt,” etc.,
etc.[52] In these few words he discriminates between the man and his
influence, and outlines his intentions to satirize and chastise the
insidious disease which had fastened itself upon the literature of the
time.This passage, with its implied sincerity of appreciation for the
real Yorick, is typical of Timme’s attitude throughout the book, and his
concern lest he should appear at any time to draw the English novelist
into his condemnation leads him to reiterate this statement of purpose
and to insist upon the contrast.Brükmann, a young theological student, for a time an intimate of the
Kurt home, is evidently intended to represent the soberer, well-balanced
thought of the time in opposition to the feverish sentimental frenzy of
the Kurt household.He makes an exception of Yorick in his condemnation
of the literary favorites, the popular novelists of that day, but he
deplores the effects of misunderstood imitation of Yorick’s work, and
argues his case with vehemence against this sentimental group.[53]
Brükmann differentiates too the different kinds of sentimentalism and
their effects in much the same fashion as Campe in his treatise
published two years before.[54] In all this Brükmann may be regarded as
the mouth-piece of the author.The clever daughter of the gentleman who
entertains Pank at his home reads a satirical poem on the then popular
literature, but expressly disclaims any attack on Yorick or “Siegwart,”
and asserts that her bitterness is intended for their imitators.Lotte,
Pank’s sensible and unsentimental, long-suffering fiancée, makes further
comment on the “apes” of Yorick, “Werther,” and “Siegwart.”

The unfolding of the story is at the beginning closely suggestive of
Tristram Shandy and is evidently intended to follow the Sterne novel in
a measure as a model.As has already been suggested, Timme’s own
narrative powers balk the continuity of the satire, but aid the interest
and the movement of the story.The movement later is, in large measure,
simple and direct.The hero is first introduced at his christening, and
the discussion of fitting names in the imposing family council is taken
from Walter Shandy’s hobby.The narrative here, in Sterne fashion, is
interrupted by a Shandean digression[55] concerning the influence of
clergymen’s collars and neck-bands upon the thoughts and minds of their
audiences.Such questions of chance influence of trifles upon the
greater events of life is a constant theme of speculation among the
pragmatics; no petty detail is overlooked in the possibility of its
portentous consequences.Walter Shandy’s hyperbolic philosophy turned
about such a focus, the exaltation of insignificant trifles into
mainsprings of action.In Shandy fashion the story doubles on itself after the introduction and
gives minute details of young Kurt’s family and the circumstances prior
to his birth.The later discussion[56] in the family council concerning
the necessary qualities in the tutor to be hired for the young Kurt is
distinctly a borrowing from Shandy.[57] Timme imitates Sterne’s method
of ridiculing pedantry; the requirements listed by the Diaconus and the
professor are touches of Walter Shandy’s misapplied, warped, and
undigested wisdom.In the nineteenth chapter of the third volume[58] we
find a Sterne passage associating itself with Shandy rather more than
the Sentimental Journey.It is a playful thrust at a score of places in
Shandy in which the author converses with the reader about the progress
of the book, and allows the mechanism of book-printing and the vagaries
of publishers to obtrude themselves upon the relation between writer and
reader.As a reminiscence of similar promises frequent in Shandy, the
author promises in the first chapter of the fourth volume to write a
book with an eccentric title dealing with a list of absurdities.[59]

But by far the greater proportion of the allusions to Sterne associate
themselves with the Sentimental Journey.A former acquaintance of Frau
Kurt, whose favorite reading was Shandy, Wieland’s “Sympatien” and the
Sentimental Journey, serves to satirize the influence of Yorick’s ass
episode; this gentleman wept at the sight of an ox at work, and never
ate meat lest he might incur the guilt of the murder of these sighing
creatures.[60]

The most constantly recurring form of satire is that of contradiction
between the sentimental expression of elevated, universal sympathy and
broader humanity and the failure to seize an immediately presented
opportunity to embody desire in deed.Thus Frau Kurt,[61] buried in
“Siegwart,” refuses persistently to be disturbed by those in immediate
need of a succoring hand.Pankraz and his mother while on a drive
discover an old man weeping inconsolably over the death of his dog.[62]
The scene of the dead ass at Nampont occurs at once to Madame Kurt and
she compares the sentimental content of these two experiences in
deprivation, finding the palm of sympathy due to the melancholy
dog-bewailer before her, thereby exalting the sentimental privilege of
her own experience as a witness.Quoting Yorick, she cries: “Shame on
the world!If men only loved one another as this man loves his dog!”[63]
At this very moment the reality of her sympathy is put to the test by
the approach of a wretched woman bearing a wretched child, begging for
assistance, but Frau Kurt, steeped in the delight of her sympathetic
emotion, repulses her rudely.Pankraz, on going home, takes his Yorick
and reads again the chapter containing the dead-ass episode; he spends
much time in determining which event was the more affecting, and tears
flow at the thought of both animals.In the midst of his vehement curses
on “unempfindsame Menschen,” “a curse upon you, you hard-hearted
monsters, who treat God’s creatures unkindly,” etc., he rebukes the
gentle advances of his pet cat Riepel, rebuffs her for disturbing his
“Wonnegefühl,” in such a heartless and cruel way that, through an
accident in his rapt delight at human sympathy, the ultimate result is
the poor creature’s death by his own fault.In the second volume[64] Timme repeats this method of satire, varying
conditions only, yet forcing the matter forward, ultimately, into the
grotesque comic, but again taking his cue from Yorick’s narrative about
the ass at Nampont, acknowledging specifically his linking of the
adventure of Madame Kurt to the episode in the Sentimental Journey.Frau
Kurt’s ardent sympathy is aroused for a goat drawing a wagon, and driven
by a peasant.She endeavors to interpret the sighs of the beast and
finally insists upon the release of the animal, which she asserts is
calling to her for aid.The poor goat’s parting bleat after its
departing owner is construed as a curse on the latter’s hardheartedness.During the whole scene the
neighboring village is in flames, houses are consumed and poor people
rendered homeless, but Frau Kurt expresses no concern, even regarding
the catastrophe as a merited affliction, because of the villagers’ lack
of sympathy with their domestic animals.The same means of satire is
again employed in the twelfth chapter of the same volume.[65] Pankraz,
overcome with pain because Lotte, his betrothed, fails to unite in his
sentimental enthusiasm and persists in common-sense, tries to bury his
grief in a wild ride through night and storm.His horse tramples
ruthlessly on a poor old man in the road; the latter cries for help, but
Pank, buried in contemplation of Lotte’s lack of sensibility, turns a
deaf ear to the appeal.In the seventeenth chapter of the third volume, a sentimental journey is
proposed, and most of the fourth volume is an account of this
undertaking and the events arising from its complications.Pankraz’s
adventures are largely repetitions of former motifs, and illustrate the
fate indissolubly linked with an imitation of Sterne’s related converse
with the fair sex.[66]

The journey runs, after a few adventures, over into an elaborate
practical joke in which Pankraz himself is burlesqued by his
contemporaries.Timme carries his poignancy and keenness of satire over
into bluntness of burlesque blows in a large part of these closing
scenes.Pankraz loses the sympathy of the reader, involuntarily and
irresistibly conceded him, and becomes an inhuman freak of absurdity,
beyond our interest.[67]

Pankraz is brought into disaster by his slavish following of suggestions
aroused through fancied parallels between his own circumstances and
those related of Yorick.He finds a sorrowing woman[68] sitting, like
Maria of Moulines, beneath a poplar tree.Pankraz insists upon carrying
out this striking analogy farther, which the woman, though she betrays
no knowledge of the Sentimental Journey, is not loath to accede to, as
it coincides with her own nefarious purposes.Timme in the following
scene strikes a blow at the abjectly sensual involved in much of the
then sentimental, unrecognized and unrealized.Pankraz meets a man carrying a cage of monkeys.[69] He buys the poor
creatures from their master, even as Frau Kurt had purchased the goat.The similarity to the Starling narrative in Sterne’s volume fills
Pankraz’s heart with glee.The Starling wanted to get out and so do his
monkeys, and Pankraz’s only questions are: “What did Yorick do?” “What
would he do?” He resolves to do more than is recorded of Yorick, release
the prisoners at all costs.Yorick’s monolog occurs to him and he
parodies it.The animals greet their release in the thankless way
natural to them,--a point already enforced in the conduct of Frau Kurt’s
goat.In the last chapter of the third volume Sterne’s relationship to “Eliza”
is brought into the narrative.Pankraz writes a letter wherein he
declares amid exaggerated expressions of bliss that he has found
“Elisa,” his “Elisa.” This is significant as showing that the name Eliza
needed no further explanation, but, from the popularity of the
Yorick-Eliza letters and the wide-spread admiration of the relation, the
name Eliza was accepted as a type of that peculiar feminine relation
which existed between Sterne and Mrs.Draper, and which appealed to
Sterne’s admirers.Pankraz’s new Order of the Garter, born of his wild frenzy[70] of
devotion over this article of Elisa’s wearing apparel, is an open satire
on Leuchsenring’s and Jacobi’s silly efforts noted elsewhere.The garter
was to bear Elisa’s silhouette and the device “Orden vom Strumpfband der
empfindsamen Liebe.”

The elaborate division of moral preachers[71] into classes may be
further mentioned as an adaptation from Sterne, cast in Yorick’s
mock-scientific manner.A consideration of these instances of allusion and adaptation with a
view to classification, reveals a single line of demarkation obvious and
unaltered.And this line divides the references to Sterne’s sentimental
influence from those to his whimsicality of narration, his vagaries of
thought; that is, it follows inevitably, and represents precisely the
two aspects of Sterne as an individual, and as an innovator in the world
of letters.But that a line of cleavage is further equally discernible
in the treatment of these two aspects is not to be overlooked.On the
one hand is the exaggerated, satirical, burlesque; on the other the
modified, lightened, softened.And these two lines of division coincide
precisely.The slight touches of whimsicality, suggesting Sterne, are a part of
Timme’s own narrative, evidently adapted with approval and appreciation;
they are never carried to excess, satirized or burlesqued, but may be
regarded as purposely adopted, as a result of admiration and presumably
as a suggestion to the possible workings of sprightliness and grace on
the heaviness of narrative prose at that time.Timme, as a clear-sighted
contemporary, certainly confined the danger of Sterne’s literary
influence entirely to the sentimental side, and saw no occasion to
censure an importation of Sterne’s whimsies.Pank’s ode on the death of
Riepel, written partly in dashes and partly in exclamation points, is
not a disproof of this assertion.Timme is not satirizing Sterne’s
whimsical use of typographical signs, but rather the Germans who
misunderstood Sterne and tried to read a very peculiar and precious
meaning into these vagaries.The sentimental is, however, always
burlesqued and ridiculed; hence the satire is directed largely against
the Sentimental Journey, and Shandy is followed mainly in those
sections, which, we are compelled to believe, he wrote for his own
pleasure, and in which he was led on by his own interest.The satire on sentimentalism is purposeful, the imitation and adaptation
of the whimsical and original is half-unconscious, and bespeaks
admiration and commendation.Timme’s book was sufficiently popular to demand a second edition, but it
never received the critical examination its merits deserved.Wieland’s
_Teutscher Merkur_ and the _Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_
ignore it completely.The _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen_ announces the
book in its issue of August 2, 1780, but the book itself is not reviewed
in its columns.The _Jenaische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen_ accords
it a colorless and unappreciative review in which Timme is reproached
for lack of order in his work (a censure more applicable to the first
volume), and further for his treatment of German authors then
popular.[72] The latter statement stamps the review as unsympathetic
with Timme’s satirical purpose.In the _Erfurtische gelehrte
Zeitung_,[73] in the very house of its own publication, the novel is
treated in a long review which hesitates between an acknowledged lack of
comprehension and indignant denunciation.The reviewer fears that the
author is a “Pasquillant oder gar ein Indifferentist” and hopes the
public will find no pleasure (Geschmack) in such bitter jesting
(Schnaken).He is incensed at Timme’s contention that the Germans were
then degenerate as compared with their Teutonic forefathers, and Timme’s
attack on the popular writers is emphatically resented.“Aber nun kömmt
das Schlimme erst,” he says, “da führt er aus Schriften unserer grössten
Schenies, aus den Lieblings-büchern der Nazion, aus Werther’s Leiden,
dem Siegwart, den Fragmenten zur Geschichte der Zärtlichkeit, Müller’s
Freuden und Leiden, Klinger’s Schriften u.s.w.zur Bestätigung seiner
Behauptung, solche Stellen mit solcher Bosheit an, dass man in der That
ganz verzweifelt wird, ob sie von einem Schenie oder von einem Affen
geschrieben sind.”

In the number for July 6, 1782, the second and third volumes are
reviewed.Pity is expressed for the poor author, “denn ich fürchte es
wird sich ein solches Geschrey wider ihn erheben, wovon ihm die Ohren
gällen werden.” Timme wrote reviews for this periodical, and the general
tone of this notice renders it not improbable that he roguishly wrote
the review himself or inspired it, as a kind of advertisement for the
novel itself.It is certainly a challenge to the opposing party.The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[74] alone seems to grasp the full
significance of the satire.“We acknowledge gladly,” says the reviewer,
“that the author has with accuracy noted and defined the rise,
development, ever-increasing contagion and plague-like prevalence of
this moral pestilence;.that the author has penetrated deep into
the knowledge of this disease and its causes.” He wishes for an
engraving of the Sterne hobby-horse cavalcade described in the first
chapter, and begs for a second and third volume, “aus deutscher
Vaterlandsliebe.” Timme is called “Our German Cervantes.”

The second and third volumes are reviewed[75] with a brief word of
continued approbation.A novel not dissimilar in general purpose, but less successful in
accomplishment, is Wezel’s “Wilhelmine Arend, oder die Gefahren der
Empfindsamkeit,” Dessau and Leipzig, 1782, two volumes.The book is more
earnest in its conception.Its author says in the preface that his
desire was to attack “Empfindsamkeit” on its dangerous and not on its
comic side, hence the book avoids in the main the lighthearted and
telling burlesque, the Hudibrastic satire of Timme’s novel.He works
along lines which lead through increasing trouble to a tragic
_dénouement_.The preface contains a rather elaborate classification of kinds of
“Empfindsamkeit,” which reminds one of Sterne’s mock-scientific
discrimination.This classification is according to temperament,
education, example, custom, reading, strength or weakness of the
imagination; there is a happy, a sad, a gentle, a vehement, a dallying,
a serious, a melancholy, sentimentality, the last being the most poetic,
the most perilous.The leading character, Wilhelmine, is, like most characters which are
chosen and built up to exemplify a preconceived theory, quite
unconvincing.In his foreword Wezel analyzes his heroine’s character and
details at some length the motives underlying the choice of attributes
and the building up of her personality.This insight into the author’s
scaffolding, this explanation of the mechanism of his puppet-show, does
not enhance the aesthetic, or the satirical force of the figure.She is
not conceived in flesh and blood, but is made to order.The story begins in letters,--a method of story-telling which was the
legacy of Richardson’s popularity--and this device is again employed in
the second volume (Part VII).Wilhelmine Arend is one of those whom
sentimentalism seized like a maddening pestiferous disease.We read of
her that she melted into tears when her canary bird lost a feather, that
she turned white and trembled when Dr.Braun hacked worms to pieces in
conducting a biological experiment.On one occasion she refused to drive
home, as this would take the horses out in the noonday sun and disturb
their noonday meal,--an exorbitant sympathy with brute creation which
owes its popularity to Yorick’s ass.It is not necessary here to relate
the whole story.Wilhelmine’s excessive sentimentality estranges her
from her husband, a weak brutish man, who has no comprehension of her
feelings.He finds a refuge in the debasing affections of a French
opera-singer, Pouilly, and gradually sinks to the very lowest level of
degradation.This all is accomplished by the interposition and active
concern of friends, by efforts at reunion managed by benevolent
intriguers and kindly advisers.Braun and Irwin is especially significant in its sane
characterization of Wilhelmine’s mental disorders, and the observations
upon “Empfindsamkeit” which are scattered through the book are
trenchant, and often markedly clever.Wilhelmine holds sentimental
converse with three kindred spirits in succession, Webson, Dittmar, and
Geissing.The first reads touching tales aloud to her and they two unite
their tears, a sentimental idea dating from the Maria of Moulines
episode.The part which the physical body, with its demands and desires
unacknowledged and despised, played as the unseen moving power in these
three friendships is clearly and forcefully brought out.Allusion to
Timme’s elucidation of this principle, which, though concealed, underlay
much of the sentimentalism of this epoch, has already been made.Finally
Wilhelmine is persuaded by her friends to leave her husband, and the
scene is shifted to a little Harz village, where she is married to
Webson; but the unreasonableness of her nature develops inordinately,
and she is unable ever to submit to any reasonable human relations, and
the rest of the tale is occupied with her increasing mental aberration,
her retirement to a hermit-like seclusion, and her death.The book, as has been seen, presents a rather pitiful satire on the
whole sentimental epoch, not treating any special manifestation, but
applicable in large measure equally to those who joined in expressing
the emotional ferment to which Sterne, “Werther” and “Siegwart” gave
impulse, and for which they secured literary recognition.Wezel fails as
a satirist, partly because his leading character is not convincing, but
largely because his satirical exaggeration, and distortion of
characteristics, which by a process of selection renders satire
efficient, fails to make the exponent of sentimentalism ludicrous, but
renders her pitiful.At the same time this satirical warping impairs the
value of the book as a serious presentation of a prevailing malady.A precursor of “Wilhelmine Arend” from Wezel’s own hand was “Die
unglückliche Schwäche,” which was published in the second volume of his
“Satirische Erzählungen.”[76] In this book we have a character with a
heart like the sieve of the Danaids, and to Frau Laclerc is attributed
“an exaggerated softness of heart which was unable to resist a single
impression, and was carried away at any time, wherever the present
impulse bore it.” The plot of the story, with the intrigues of Graf.Z.,
the Pouilly of the piece, the separation of husband and wife, their
reunion, the disasters following directly in the train of weakness of
heart in opposing sentimental attacks, are undoubtedly children of the
same purpose as that which brought forth “Wilhelmine Arend.”

Another satirical protest was, as one reads from a contemporary review,
“Die Tausend und eine Masche, oder Yoricks wahres Shicksall, ein blaues
Mährchen von Herrn Stanhope” (1777, 8vo).The book purports to be the
posthumous work of a young Englishman, who, disgusted with Yorick’s
German imitators, grew finally indignant with Yorick himself.The
_Almanach der deutschen Musen_ (1778, pp.99-100) finds that the author
misjudges Yorick.The book is written in part if not entirely in verse.In 1774 a correspondent of Wieland’s _Merkur_ writes, begging this
authoritative periodical to condemn a weekly paper just started in
Prague, entitled “Wochentlich Etwas,” which is said to be written in the
style of Tristram Shandy and the Sentimental Journey, M . . .and “die Beyträge zur Geheimen Geschichte des menschlichen Herzens und
Verstandes,” and thereby is a shame to “our dear Bohemia.”

In this way it is seen how from various sources and in various ways
protest was made against the real or distorted message of Laurence
Sterne.[Footnote 2: 1772, July 7.][Footnote 3: See Erich Schmidt’s “Heinrich Leopold Wagner,

    that the underlying thought of Musäus in his “Physiognomische
    Reisen” would, if handled by Lichtenberg, have made the most
    fruitful stuff for a humorous novel in Sterne’s style.][Footnote 12: II, 11-12: “Im ersten Fall wird er nie, nach dem die

    sondern wirft den Leser oft mehr zur Bewunderung seiner Kunst, als

"O souls so cruel!that the farthest post
Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove
The harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief
Impregnate at my heart, some little space
Ere it congeal again!"I thus replied:
"Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;
And if I extricate thee not, far down
As to the lowest ice may I descend!""The friar Alberigo," answered he,
"Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd
Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date
More luscious for my fig."--"Hah!"I exclaim'd,
"Art thou too dead!"--"How in the world aloft
It fareth with my body," answer'd he,
"I am right ignorant.Such privilege
Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul
Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc'd.And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
The glazed tear-drops that o'erlay mine eyes,
Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,
As I did, yields her body to a fiend
Who after moves and governs it at will,
Till all its time be rounded; headlong she
Falls to this cistern.And perchance above
Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,
Who here behind me winters.Him thou know'st,
If thou but newly art arriv'd below.The years are many that have pass'd away,
Since to this fastness Branca Doria came.""Now," answer'd I, "methinks thou mockest me,
For Branca Doria never yet hath died,
But doth all natural functions of a man,
Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."He thus: "Not yet unto that upper foss
By th' evil talons guarded, where the pitch
Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach'd,
When this one left a demon in his stead
In his own body, and of one his kin,
Who with him treachery wrought.But now put forth
Thy hand, and ope mine eyes."men perverse in every way,
With every foulness stain'd, why from the earth
Are ye not cancel'd?Such an one of yours
I with Romagna's darkest spirit found,
As for his doings even now in soul
Is in Cocytus plung'd, and yet doth seem
In body still alive upon the earth.CANTO XXXIV

"THE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth
Towards us; therefore look," so spake my guide,
"If thou discern him."As, when breathes a cloud
Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night
Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far
A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,
Such was the fabric then methought I saw,

To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew
Behind my guide: no covert else was there.Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
Record the marvel) where the souls were all
Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass
Pellucid the frail stem.Some prone were laid,
Others stood upright, this upon the soles,
That on his head, a third with face to feet
Arch'd like a bow.When to the point we came,
Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see
The creature eminent in beauty once,
He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.and lo the place,
Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."How frozen and how faint I then became,
Ask me not, reader!for I write it not,
Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.Think thyself
If quick conception work in thee at all,
How I did feel.That emperor, who sways
The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice
Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
A giant, than the giants are in his arms.Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits
With such a part.If he were beautiful
As he is hideous now, and yet did dare
To scowl upon his Maker, well from him
May all our mis'ry flow.How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy
Upon his head three faces: one in front
Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this
Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;
The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left
To look on, such as come from whence old Nile
Stoops to the lowlands.Under each shot forth
Two mighty wings, enormous as became
A bird so vast.Sails never such I saw
Outstretch'd on the wide sea.No plumes had they,
But were in texture like a bat, and these
He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still
Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth
Was frozen.At six eyes he wept: the tears
Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd
Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three
Were in this guise tormented.But far more
Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd
By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back
Was stript of all its skin."That upper spirit,
Who hath worse punishment," so spake my guide,
"Is Judas, he that hath his head within
And plies the feet without.Of th' other two,
Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw
Who hangs, is Brutus: lo!how he doth writhe
And speaks not!Th' other Cassius, that appears
So large of limb.But night now re-ascends,
And it is time for parting.I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;
And noting time and place, he, when the wings
Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,
And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd
Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh
Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,
My leader there with pain and struggling hard
Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,
And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,
That into hell methought we turn'd again."Expect that by such stairs as these," thus spake
The teacher, panting like a man forespent,
"We must depart from evil so extreme."Then at a rocky opening issued forth,
And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd
With wary step my side.I rais'd mine eyes,
Believing that I Lucifer should see
Where he was lately left, but saw him now
With legs held upward.Let the grosser sort,
Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,
Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then."Arise," my master cried, "upon thy feet.The way is long, and much uncouth the road;
And now within one hour and half of noon
The sun returns."It was no palace-hall
Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,
But natural dungeon where ill footing was
And scant supply of light."Ere from th' abyss
I sep'rate," thus when risen I began,
"My guide!vouchsafe few words to set me free
From error's thralldom.How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?And how from eve to morn in space so brief
Hath the sun made his transit?"He in few
Thus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still
On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd
Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I
Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass
That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd
All heavy substance.Thou art now arriv'd
Under the hemisphere opposed to that,
Which the great continent doth overspread,
And underneath whose canopy expir'd
The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd.Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,
Whose other aspect is Judecca.Morn
Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,
Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,
As at the first.On this part he fell down
From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,
And to our hemisphere retir'd.Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears,
That sprang aloof."There is a place beneath,
From Belzebub as distant, as extends
The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,
But by the sound of brooklet, that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock,
Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,
The wave hath eaten.By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter, to return
To the fair world: and heedless of repose
We climbed, he first, I following his steps,
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.Ingersoll has been called the Apostle of Unbelief.But the title
is a misnomer.His mouth is full to the lips of positive statements of
strong conviction.He is above all
things the Apostle of Freedom.Freedom for Nations, for Communities, for
Men.the zeal with which he blows
the trumpet of Liberty, the enthusiasm with which he waves the banner of
Freedom, reminds one of Tennyson's fine words:--

     Of old stood Freedom on the heights,
     The thunders breaking at her feet,
     Above her shook the starry lights;
     She heard the torrents meet.Then stepped she down thro' town and field
     To mingle with the human race,
     And part by part to men revealed
     The fullness of her face--
     Her open eyes desire the truth,
     The wisdom of a thousand years
     Is in them.May perpetual youth
     Keep dry their light from tears;
     That her fair form may stand and shine:
     Make bright our days and light our dreams,
     Tuning to scorn with lips divine
     The falsehood of extremes!THE ROMANCE OF FARM LIFE




1.Ingersoll as a Farmer

When I was a farmer they used to haul wheat two hundred miles in wagons
and sell it for thirty-five cents a bushel.They would bring home about
three hundred feet of lumber, two bunches of shingles, a barrel of salt,
and a cook-stove that never would draw and never did bake.In those blessed days the people lived on corn and bacon.Eating was a necessity, not a pleasure.It was hard work
for the cook to keep on good terms even with hunger.The rain held the roofs in perfect contempt, and the snow drifted
joyfully on the floors and beds.The horses were kept
in rail pens surrounded with straw.Long before spring the sides would
be eaten away and nothing but roofs would be left.When
the cattle were exposed to all the blasts of winter, it took all
the corn and oats that could be stuffed into them to prevent actual
starvation.In those times farmers thought the best place for the
pig-pen was immediately in front of the house.Women were supposed to know the art of making fires without
fuel.The wood-pile consisted, as a general thing, of one log, upon
which an axe or two had been worn out in vain.There was nothing
to kindle a fire with.Pickets were pulled from the garden fence,
clap-boards taken from the house, and every stray plank was seized upon
for kindling.The Happy Life of the Farm

There is a quiet about the life of a farmer, and the hope of a
serene old age, that no other business or profession can promise.A professional man is doomed some time to find that his powers are
wanting.He is doomed to see younger and stronger men pass him in the
race of life.He looks forward to an old age of intellectual mediocrity.He will be last where once he was the first.But the farmer goes as it
were into partnership, with nature--he lives with trees and flowers--he
breathes the sweet air of the fields.There is no constant and frightful
strain upon his mind.He
watches his flocks and herds as they feed upon the green and sunny
<DW72>s.He hears the pleasant rain falling upon the waving corn, and the
trees he planted in youth rustle above him as he plants others for the
children yet to be.The Ambitious Farmer's Boy

Nearly every farmer's boy took an oath that he would never cultivate
the soil.The moment they arrived at the age of twenty-one they left
the desolate and dreary farms and rushed to the towns and cities.They
wanted to be book-keepers, doctors, merchants, railroad men, insurance
agents, lawyers, even preachers, anything to avoid the drudgery of the
farm.Nearly every boy acquainted with the three R's--reading, writing
and arithmetic--imagined that he had altogether more education than
ought to be wasted in raising potatoes and corn.They made haste to get
into some other business.Those who stayed upon the farm envied those
who went away.There are hundreds of graduates of Yale and Harvard and other colleges
who are agents of sewing machines, solicitors for insurance, clerks and
copyists, in short, performing a hundred varieties of menial service.They seem willing to do anything that is not regarded as work--anything
that can be done in a town, in the house, in an office, but they avoid
farming as they would leprosy.Nearly every young man educated in this
way is simply ruined.Boys and girls should be educated to help themselves; they should be
taught that it is disgraceful to be seen idle, and dishonorable to be
useless.Happiness the Object of Life

Remember, I pray you, that you are in partnership with all labor--that
you should join hands with all the sons and daughters of toil, and that
all who work belong to the same noble family.Happiness should be the object of life, and if life on the farm can be
made really happy, the children will grow up in love with the meadows,
the streams, the woods and the old home.Around the farm will cling and
cluster the happy memories of the delight-ful years.The Sunset of the Farmer's Life

For my part, I envy the man who has lived on the same broad acres from
his boyhood, who cultivates the fields where in youth he played, and
lives where his father lived and died.I can imagine no sweeter way to
end one's life than in the quiet of the country, out of the mad race
for money, place and power--far from the demands of business--out of the
dusty highway where fools struggle and strive for the hoi ow praise of
other fools.Surrounded by these pleasant fields and faithful friends,
by those I have loved, I hope to end my days.The farmers should vote only for such men as are able and willing to
guard and advance the interests of labor.We should know better than
to vote for men who will deliberately put a tariff of three dollars
a thousand upon Canada lumber, when every farmer in the States is a
purchaser of lumber.People who live upon the prairies ought to vote for
cheap lumber.We ought to have intelligence
enough to know what we want and how to get it.The real laboring men of
this country can succeed if they are united.By laboring men, I do not
mean only the farmers.I mean all who contribute in some way to the
general welfare.Eat the best things you raise and sell
the rest.Have good things to cook and good things to cook with.Of all
people in our country, you should live the best.Throw your miserable
little stoves out of the window.Get ranges, and have them so built that
your wife need not burn her face off to get you a breakfast.Do not make
her cook in a kitchen hot as the orthodox perdition.The beef, not the
cook, should be roasted.It is just as easy to have things convenient
and right as to have them any other way.There is no reason why farmers should not be the kindest and most
cultivated of men.There is nothing in plowing the fields to make men
cross, cruel and crabbed.To look upon the sunny <DW72>s covered with
daisies does not tend to make men unjust.Whoever labors for the
happiness of those he loves, elevates himself, no matter whether he
works in the dreary shop or the perfumed field.The wagons stood
in the sun and rain, and the plows rusted in the fields.There was
no leisure, no feeling that the work was done.It was all labor and
weariness and vexation of spirit.The crops were destroyed by wandering
herds, or they were put in too late, or too early, or they were blown
down, or caught by the frost, or devoured by bugs, or stung by flies,
or eaten by worms, or carried away by birds, or dug up by gophers, or
washed away by floods, or dried up by the sun, or rotted in the stack,
or heated in the crib, or they all ran to vines, or tops, or straw, or
cobs.And when in spite of all these accidents that lie in wait between
the plow and reaper, they did succeed in raising a good crop and a high
price was offered, then the roads would be impassable.And when the
roads got good, then the prices went down.The Farmer's Happy Winter

I can imagine no condition that carries with it such a promise of joy
as that of the farmer in early winter.He has his cellar filled--he had
made every preparation for the days of snow and storm--he looks forward
to three months of ease and rest; to three months of fireside content;
three months with wife and children; three months of long, delightful
evenings; three months of home; three months of solid comfort.The Almighty Dollar

Ainsworth R. Spofford--says Col.Ingersoll--gives the following facts
about interest: "One dollar loaned for one hundred years at six per
cent., with the interest collected annually and added to the principal,
will amount to three hundred and forty dollars.At eight per cent, it
amounts to two thousand two hundred and three dollars.At three per
cent, it amounts only to nineteen dollars and twenty-five cents.At ten
per cent, it is thirteen thousand eight hundred and nine dollars, or
about seven hundred times as much.At twelve per cent, it amounts
to eighty-four thousand and seventy-five dollars, or more than four
thousand times as much.At eighteen per cent, it amounts to fifteen
million one hundred and forty-five thousand and seven dollars.At
twenty-four per cent, it reaches the enormous sum of two billion, five
hundred and fifty-one million, seven hundred and ninety-five thousand,
four hundred and four dollars!"One dollar at compound interest, at
twenty-four per cent., for one hundred years, would produce a sum equal
to our national debt.The Farmer in Debt

Interest eats night and day, and the more it eats the hungrier it grows.The farmer in debt, lying awake at night, can, if he listens, hear it
gnaw.If he owes nothing, he can hear his corn grow.Get out of debt,
as soon as you possibly can.You have supported idle avarice and lazy
economy long enough.Own Your Own Home

There can be no such thing in the highest sense as a home unless you own
it.There must be an incentive to plant trees, to beautify the grounds,
to preserve and improve.It elevates a man to own a home.It gives a
certain independence, a force of character that is obtained in no other
way.A man without a home feels like a passenger.There is in such a man
a little of the vagrant.He who has sat by his
own fireside with wife and children, will defend it.Few men have been
patriotic enough to shoulder a musket in defense of a boarding-house.The prosperity and glory of our country depend upon the number of people
who are the owners of homes.What to do with the Idlers

Our country is filled with the idle and unemployed, and the great
question asking for an answer is: What shall be done with these men?To this there is but one answer: They must
cultivate the soil.Those who work
the land must have an honest pride in their business.They must educate
their children to cultivate the soil.Farm-Life Lonely

I say again, if you want more men and women on the farms, something must
be done to make farm-life pleasant.One great difficulty is that the
farm is lonely.People write about the pleasures of solitude, but they
are found only in books.The Best Farming States

The farmer in the Middle States has the best soil--the greatest return
for the least labor--more leisure--more time for enjoyment than any
other farmer in the world.He has the
long winters in which to become acquainted with his family--with his
neighbors--in which to read and keep abreast with the advanced thought
of his day.He has the time and means of self-culture.He has more time
than the mechanic, the merchant or the professional man.If the farmer
is not well informed it is his own fault.Books are cheap, and every
farmer can have enough to give him the outline of every science, and an
idea of all that has been accomplished by man.The Laborers, the Kings and Queens

The farmer has been elevated through science, and he should not forget
the debt he owes to the mechanic, to the inventor, to the thinker.He
should remember that all laborers belong to the same grand family--that
they are the real kings and queens, the only true nobility.HOME AND CHILDREN




19.The Family the Only Heaven in this World

Don't make that poor girl play ten years on a piano when she has no
ear for music, and when she has practiced until she can play "Bonaparte
Crossing the Alps," you can't tell after she has played it whether
Bonaparte ever got across or not.Men are oaks, women are vines,
children are flowers, and if there is any Heaven in this world it is
in the family.It is where the wife loves the husband, and the husband
loves the wife, and where the dimpled arms of children are about the
necks of both.I want to tell you this, you cannot get the robe of hypocrisy on you so
thick that the sharp eye of childhood will not see through every veil.Love and Freedom in a Cabin

I would rather go to the forest far away and build me a little
cabin--build it myself and daub it with mud, and live there with my wife
aud family--and have a little path that led down to the spring, where
the water bubbled out day and night, like a little poem from the heart
of the earth; a little hut with some hollyhocks at the corner, with
their bannered bosoms open to the sun, and with the thrush in the air,
like a song of joy in the morning; I would rather live there and have
some lattice work across the window, so that the sunlight would fall
checkered on the baby in the cradle; I would rather live there and have
my soul erect and free, than to live in a palace of gold and wear the
crown of imperial power and know that my soul was slimy with hypocrisy.The Turnpike Road of Happiness

Whoever marries simply for himself will make a mistake; but whoever
loves a woman so well that he says, "I will make her happy," makes no
mistake; and so with the woman who says, "I will make him happy."There
is only one way to be happy, and that is to make somebody else so, and
you can't be happy cross-lots; you have got to go the regular turnpike
road.Love Paying Ten Per Cent

I tell you to-night there is on the average more love in the homes of
the poor than in the palaces of the rich; and the meanest hut with love
in it is fit for the gods, and a palace without love is a den only fit
for wild beasts.You can't be so poor but that you
can help somebody.Good nature is the cheapest commodity in the world;
and love is the only thing that will pay ten per cent, to borrower and
lender both.Don't tell me that you have got to be rich!We have all a
false standard of greatness in the United States.We think here that a
man to be great must be notorious; he must be extremely wealthy or his
name must be between the lips of rumor.It is not
necessary to be rich to be great, or to be powerful to be happy; and the
happy man is the successful man.Happiness is the legal-tender of the
soul.A Word to the Cross-Grained

A cross man I hate above all things.What right has he to murder the
sunshine of the day?What right has he to assassinate the joy of life?When you go home you ought to feel the light there is in the house;
if it is in the night it will burst out of the doors and windows and
illuminate the darkness.It is just as well to go home a ray of sunshine
as an old, sour, cross curmudgeon, who thinks he is the head of the
family.Wise men think their mighty brains have been in a turmoil; they
have been thinking about who will be alderman from the Fifth ward; they
have been thinking about politics; great and mighty questions have been
engaging their minds; they have bought calico at eight cents or six, and
want to sell it for seven.Think of the intellectual strain that must
have been upon a man, and when he gets home everybody else in the house
must look out for his comfort.Daughters and Wives be Beautiful

I am a believer in fashion.It is the duty of every woman to make
herself as beautiful and attractive as she possibly can."Handsome is
as handsome does," but she is much handsomer if well dressed.The time
never ought to come in this country when you can tell a farmer's
daughter simply by the garments she wears.I say to every girl and
woman, no matter what the material of your dress may be, no matter how
cheap and coarse it is, cut it and make it in the fashion.Some people look upon it as barbaric, but in my judgment,
wearing jewelry is the first evidence the barbarian gives of a wish to
be civilized.To adorn ourselves seems to be a part of our nature, and
this desire, seems to be everywhere and in everything.I have sometimes
thought that the desire for beauty covers the earth with flowers.It
is this desire that paints the wings of moths, tints the chamber of the
shell, and gives the bird its plumage and its song.daughters and
wives if you would be loved, adorn yourselves--if you would be adorned,
be beautiful!A Wholesome Word to the Stingy

I despise a stingy man.I don't see how it is possible for a man to die
worth fifty millions of dollars or ten millions of dollars, in a city
full of want, when he meets almost every day the withered hand of
beggary and the white lips of famine.How a man can withstand all
that, and hold in the clutch of his greed twenty or thirty millions
of dollars, is past my comprehension.I do not see how he can do it.I
should not think he could do it any more than he could keep a pile of
lumber where hundreds and thousands of men were drowning in the sea.I
should not think he could do it.Do you know I have known men who would
trust their wives with their hearts and their honor, but not with their
pocketbook; not with a dollar.When I see a man of that kind I always
think he knows which of these articles is the most valuable.The Boss of the Family

If you are the grand emperor of the world, you had better be the grand
emperor of one loving and tender heart, and she the grand empress of
yours.The man who has really won the love of one good woman in this
world, I do not care if he dies a beggar, his life has been a success.I tell you it is an infamous word and an infamous feeling--a man who is
"boss," who is going to govern in his family; and when he speaks let all
the rest of them be still; some mighty idea is about to be launched from
his mouth.A good way to make children tell the truth is to tell it yourself.Keep
your word with your child the same as you would with your banker.Be
perfectly honor bright with your children, and they will be your friends
when you are old.The Opera at the Table

I like to hear children at the table telling what big things they have
seen during the day; I like to hear their merry voices mingling with the
clatter of knives and forks.I had rather hear that than any opera that
was ever put upon the stage.A Child's laugh sweeter than Apollo's lyre

I said, and I say again, no day can be so sacred but that the laugh of
a child will make the holiest day more sacred still.Strike with hand
of fire, oh, weird musician, thy harp, strung with Apollo's golden
hair; fill the vast cathedral aisles with symphonies sweet and dim, deft
toucher of the organ keys; blow, bugler, blow, until thy silver notes do
touch the skies, with moonlit waves, and charm the lovers wandering on
the vine-clad hills: but know, your sweetest strains are discords all,
compared with childhood's happy laugh, the laugh that fills the eyes
with light and every heart with joy; oh, rippling river of life, thou
art the blessed boundary-line between the beasts and man, and every
wayward wave of thine doth drown some fiend of care; oh, laughter,
divine daughter of joy, make dimples enough in the cheeks of the world
to catch and hold and glorify all the tears of grief.Don't Wake the Children

Let your children sleep.Do not drag them from their beds in the
darkness of night.Do not compel them to associate all that is tiresome,
irksome and dreadful with cultivating the soil.Treat your children with
infinite kindness--treat them as equals.There is no happiness in a home
not filled with love.When the husband hates his wife--where the wife
hates the husband; where the children hate their parents and each
other--there is a hell upon earth.How to Deal with Children

Some Christians act as though they thought when the Lord said, "Suffer
little children to come unto me," that he had a rawhide under his
mantle--they act as if they thought so.I tell my
children this: Go where you may, commit what crime you may, fall to what
depths of degradation you may, I can never shut my arms, my heart or my
door to you.As long as I live you shall have one sincere friend; do not
be afraid to tell anything wrong you have done; ten to one if I have not
done the same thing.I am not perfection, and if it is necessary to sin
in order to have sympathy, I am glad I have committed sin enough to have
sympathy.The sterness of perfection I do not want.I am going to live
so that my children can come to my grave and truthfully say, "He who
sleeps here never gave us one moment of pain."Whether you call that
religion or infidelity, suit yourselves; that is the way I intend to do
it.Give a Child a Chance

Do not create a child to be a post set in an orthodox row; raise
investigators and thinkers, not disciples and followers; cultivate
reason, not faith; cultivate investigation, not superstition; and if
you have any doubt yourself about a thing being so, tell them about it;
don't tell them the world was made in six days--if you think six days
means six good whiles, tell them six good whiles.If you have any doubts
about anybody being in a furnace and not being burnt, or even getting
uncomfortably warm, tell them so--be honest about it.If you look upon
the jaw-bone of a donkey as not a good weapon, say so.If you think a man never went to sea in a fish, tell them so, it
won't make them any worse.Be honest--that's all; don't cram their heads
with things that will take them years to unlearn; tell them facts--it
is just as easy.It is as easy to find out botany, and astronomy, and
geology, and history--it is as easy to find out all these things as to
cram their minds with things you know nothing about.The Greatest Liars in Michigan

I was over in Michigan the other day.There was a boy over there at
Grand Rapids about five or six years old, a nice, smart boy, as you will
see from the remark he made--what you might call a nineteenth century
boy.His father and mother had promised to take him out riding for about
three weeks, and they would slip off and go without him.Well, after
a while that got kind of played out with the little boy, and the day
before I was there they played the trick on him again.They went out and
got the carriage, and went away, and as they rode away from the front of
the house, he happened to be standing there with his nurse, and he
saw them.The whole thing flashed on him in a moment.He took in the
situation, and turned to his nurse and said, pointing to his father and
mother: "There go the two biggest liars in the State of Michigan!"When
you go home fill the house with joy, so that the light of it will stream
out the windows and doors, and illuminate even the darkness.It is just
as easy that way as any in the world.When your child confesses to you that it has com mitted a fault, take
the child in your arms, and let it feel your heart beat against its
heart, and raise your children in the sunlight of love, and they will be
sunbeams to you along the pathway of life.Abolish the club and the whip
from the house, because, if the civilized use a whip, the ignorant and
the brutal will use a club, and they will use it because you use the
whip.A Solemn Satire on Whipping Children

If there is one of you here that ever expect to whip your child again,
let me ask you something.Have your photograph taken at the time, and
let it show your face red with vulgar anger, and the face of the little
one with eyes swimming in tears.If that little child should die I
cannot think of a sweeter way to spend an Autumn afternoon than to take
that photograph and go to the cemetery, where the maples are clad in
tender gold, and when little scarlet runners are coming, like poems of
regret, from the sad heart of the earth; and sit down upon that mound,
I look upon that photograph, and think of the flesh, made dust, that you
beat.I could not bear to die in the arms of a child
that I had whipped.I could not bear to feel upon my lips, when they
were withering beneath the touch of death, the kiss of one that I had
struck.Children are better treated than they used to be; the old whips and
gods are out of the schools, and they are governing children by love and
sense.The world is getting better; it is getting better in Maine.It
has got better in Maine, in Vermont.It is getting better in every State
of the North.INDIVIDUALITY




38.Absolute Independence of the Individual

What we want to-day is what our fathers wrote.They did not attain to
their ideal; we approach it nearer, but have not yet reached it.We
want, not only the independence of a state, not only the independence of
a nation, but something far more glorious--the absolute independence of
the individual.I want it so that I, one of the
children of Nature, can stand on an equality with the rest; that I can
say this is my air, my sunshine, my earth, and I have a right to live,
and hope, and aspire, and labor, and enjoy the fruit of that labor, as
much as any individual, or any nation on the face of the globe.Saved by Disobedience

I tell you there is something splendid in man that will not always mind.Why, if we had done as the kings told us five hundred years ago, we
would all have been slaves.If we had done as the priests told us, we
would all have been idiots.If we had done as the doctors told us, we
would all have been dead.We have
been saved by that splendid thing called independence, and I want to
see more of it, day after day, and I want to see children raised so they
will have it.Intellectual Tyranny

Nothing can be more infamous than intellectual tyranny.To put chains
upon the body is as nothing compared with putting shackles on the brain.No god is entitled to the worship or the respect of man who does not
give, even to the meanest of his children, every right that he claims
for himself.Say What You Think

I do not believe that the tendency is to make men and women brave and
glorious when you tell them that there are certain ideas upon certain
subjects that they must never express; that they must go through life
with a pretense as a shield; that their neighbors will think much more
of them if they will only keep still; and that above all is a God who
despises one who honestly expresses what he believes.For my part, I
believe men will be nearer honest in business, in politics, grander in
art--in everything that is good and grand and beautiful, if they are
taught from the cradle to the coffin to tell their honest opinions.I Want to Put Out the Fires of Hell

Some people tell me that I take away the hope of immortality.I want to put out the fires of hell.I want to
transfer the war from this earth to heaven.Some tell me Jehovah is God,
and another says Ali is God, and another that Brahma is God.I say, let
Jehovah, and Ali, and Brahma fight it out.Let them fight it out there,
and whoever is victor, to that God I will bow.The Puritans

When the Puritans first came they were narrow.They did not understand
what liberty meant--what religious liberty, what political liberty, was;
but they found out in a few years.There was one feeling among them that
rises to their eternal honor like a white shaft to the clouds--they were
in favor of universal education.Wherever they went they built school
houses, introduced books, and ideas of literature.They believed that
every man should know how to read and how to write, and should find out
all that his capacity allowed him to comprehend.That is the glory of
the Puritan fathers.A Star in the Sky of Despair

Every Christian, every philanthropist, every believer in human liberty,
should feel under obligation to Thomas Paine for the splendid service
rendered by him in the darkest days of the American Revolution.In the
midnight of Valley Forge, "The Crisis" was the first star that glittered
in the wide horizon of despair.Every good man should remember with
gratitude the brave words spoken by Thomas Paine in the French
Convention against the death of Louis.He said: "We will kill the king,
but not the man.You send missionaries to Turkey, and tell them that the Koran is a lie.You tell them that Mahomet was not a prophet.You go to India, and you tell them
that Vishnu was nothing, that Purana was nothing, that Buddha was
nobody, and your Brahma, he is nothing.You should not do that; you ought not to hurt their feelings.I tell you
no man on earth has a right to be shocked at the expression of an honest
opinion when it is kindly done, and I don't believe there is any God in
the universe who has put a curtain over the fact and made it a crime for
the honest hand of investigation to endeavor to draw that curtain.I will Settle with God Myself

They say to me, "God will punish you forever, if you do these things."I had rather settle with him than
any one of his agents.In theology I am a
granger--I do not believe in middlemen.What little business I have with
Heaven I will attend to myself.I Claim my Right to Guess

I claim, standing under the flag of nature, under the blue and the
stars, that I am the peer of any other man, and have the right to think
and express my thoughts.I claim that in the presence of the Unknown,
and upon a subject that nobody knows anything about, and never did, I
have as good a right to _guess_ as anybody else.The Brain a Castle

Surely it is worth something to feel that there are no priests, no
popes, no parties, no governments, no kings, no gods, to whom your
intellect can be compelled to pay reluctant homage.Surely it is a joy
to know that all the cruel ingenuity of bigotry can devise no prison,
no dungeon, no cell in which for one instant to confine a thought; that
ideas cannot be dislocated by racks, nor crushed in iron boots, nor
burned with fire.Surely it is sublime to think that the brain is a
castle, and that within its curious bastions and winding halls the
soul, in spite of all words and all beings, is the supreme sovereign of
itself.I am Something

The universe is all there is, or was, or will be.It is both subject and
object; contemplator and contemplated; creator and created; destroyer
and destroyed; preserver and preserved; and hath within itself all
causes, modes, motions, and effects.Without the
all, the infinite cannot be.Every Man a Bight to Think

Now we have come to the conclusion that every man has a right to think.Would God give a bird wings and make it a crime to fly?Would he give me
brains and make it a crime to think?Any God that would damn one of his
children for the expression of his honest thought wouldn't make a decent
thief.When I read a book and don't believe it, I ought to say so.I
will do so and take the consequence like a man.Too Early to Write a Creed

These are the excuses I have for my race, and taking everything into
consideration, I think we have done extremely well.Let us have more
liberty and free thought.It is too
early in the history of the world to write a creed.Our fathers were
intellectual slaves; our fathers were intellectual serfs.There never
has been a free generation on the globe.Every creed you have got bears
the mark of whip, and chain, and fagot.There has been no creed written by a free brain.Wait until we have had
two or three generations of liberty and it will then be time enough to
seize the swift horse of progress by the bridle and say--thus far and
no farther; and in the meantime let us be kind to each other; let us be
decent towards each other.We are all travelers on the great plain we
call life, and there is nobody quite sure what road to take--not just
dead sure, you know.There are lots of guide-boards on the plain and you
find thousands of people swearing to-day that their guide-board is the
only board that shows the right direction.I go and talk to them and
they say: "You go that way, or you will be damned."I go to another and
they say: "You go this way, or you will be damned."Every Mind True to Itself

In my judgment, every human being should take a road of his own.Every
mind should be true to itself--should think, investigate and conclude
for itself.This is a duty alike incumbent upon pauper and prince.In every age some men carried the torch of progress and handed it
to some other, and it has been carried through all the dark ages of
barbarism, and had it not been for such men we would have been naked
and uncivilized to-night, with pictures of wild beasts tattooed on our
skins, dancing around some dried snake fetish.Gold makes a Barren Landscape

Only a few days ago I was where they wrench the precious metals from
the miserly clutch of the rocks.When I saw the mountains; treeless,
shrubless, flowerless, without even a spire of grass, it seemed to me
that gold had the same effect upon the country that holds it, as upon
the man who lives and labors only for it.It affects the land as it
does the man.It leaves the heart barren without a flower of
kindness--without a blossom of pity.A Grand Achievement

There is nothing grander than to rescue from the leprosy of slander the
reputation of a great and generous name.There is nothing nobler than to
benefit our benefactors.The Divorce of Church and State

The Constitution of the United States was the first decree entered in
the high court of a nation, forever divorcing Church and State.Professors

Instead of dismissing professors for finding something out, let us
rather discharge those who do not.Let each teacher understand that
investigation is not dangerous for him; that his bread is safe, no
matter how much truth he may discover, and that his salary will not be
reduced, simply because he finds that the ancient Jews did not know the
entire history of the world.Developement

I thought after all I had rather belong to a race of people that came
from skulless vertebrae in the dim Laurentian period, that wiggled
without knowing they were wiggling, that began to develope and came up
by a gradual developement until they struck this gentleman in the dugout
coming up slowly--up--up--up--until, for instance, they produced such a
man as Shakespeare--he who harvested all the fields of dramatic thought,
and after whom all others have been only gleaners of straw, he who found
the human intellect dwelling in a hut, touched it with the wand of his
genius and it became a palace--producing him and hundreds of others I
might mention--with the angels of progress leaning over the far horizon
beckoning this race of work and thought--I had rather belong to a race
commencing at the skulless vertebrae producing the gentleman in the
dugout and so on up, than to have descended from a perfect pair, upon
which the Lord has lost money from that day to this.I had rather belong
to a race that is going up than to one that is going down.I would
rather belong to one that commenced at the skulless vertebrae and
started for perfection, than to belong to one that started from
perfection and started for the skulless vertebrae.Poet's Dream

When every church becomes a school, every cathedral a university, every
clergyman a teacher, and all their hearers brave and honest
thinkers, then, and not until then, will the dream of poet, patriot,
philanthropist and philosopher, become a real and blessed truth.The Temple of the Future

We are laying the foundations of the grand temple of the future--not the
temple of all the gods, but of all the people--wherein, with appropriate
rites, will be celebrated the religion of Humanity.We are doing what
little we can to hasten the coming of the day when society shall cease
producing millionaires and mendicants--gorged indolence and famished
industry--truth in rags, and superstition robed and crowned.We are
looking for the time when the useful shall be the honorable; and when
Reason, throned upon the world's brain, shall be the King of Kings, and
God of Gods.The final Goal

We do not expect to accomplish everything in our day; but we want to
do what good we can, and to render all the service possible in the
holy cause of human progress.We know that doing away with gods and
supernatural persons and powers is not an end.It is a means to the end;
the real end being the happiness of man.The Eighteenth Century

At that time the seeds sown by the great Infidels were beginning to
bear fruit in France.The Eighteenth
Century was crowning its gray hairs with the wreath of Progress.On
every hand Science was bearing testimony against the Church.Voltaire
had filled Europe with light; D'Holbach was giving to the _elite_
of Paris the principles contained in his "System of Nature."The
Encyclopedists had attacked superstition with information for the
masses.A few had the
courage to keep their shoes on and let the bush burn.America had set an
example to the world.The word Liberty was in the mouths of men, and
they began to wipe the dust from their knees.The dawn of a new day had
appeared.POLITICAL QUESTIONS




63.Ours is the only flag that
has in reality written upon it: Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--the three
grandest words in all the languages of men.Liberty: Give to every man
the fruit of his own labor--the labor of his hand and of his brain.Fraternity: Every man in the right is my brother.Equality: The rights
of all are equal.No race, no color, no previous condition, can change
the rights of men.The Declaration of Independence has at last been
carried out in letter and in spirit.To-day the black man looks upon his
child and says: The avenues of distinction are open to you--upon your
brow may fall the civic wreath.We are celebrating the courage and
wisdom of our fathers, and the glad shout of a free people, the anthem
of a grand nation, commencing at the Atlantic, is following the sun to
the Pacific, across a continent of happy homes.Is it
nothing to fill the world with light, with discovery, with science?Is it nothing to dignify man and exalt the intellect?Is it nothing to
grope your way into the dreary prisons, the damp and dropping dungeons,
the dark and silent cells of superstition, where the souls of men
are chained to floors of stone?Is it nothing to conduct these souls
gradually into the blessed light of day,--to let them see again the
happy fields, the sweet, green earth, and hear the everlasting music of
the waves?Is it nothing to make men wipe the dust from their swollen
knees, the tears from their blanched and furrowed cheeks?Is it nothing
to relieve the heavens of an insatiate monster, and write upon the
eternal dome, glittering with stars, the grand word--Liberty?Ingersoll Not a Politician

I want it perfectly understood that I am not a politician.I believe in
liberty, and I want to see the time when every man, woman and child will
enjoy every human right.Civilization

Civilization is the child of free thought.The new world has drifted
away from the rotten wharf of superstition.The politics of this country
are being settled by the new ideas of individual liberty, and parties
and churches that cannot accept the new truths must perish.Cornell University

With the single exception of Cornell, there is not a college in the
United States where truth has ever been a welcome guest.The moment one
of the teachers denies the inspiration of the Bible, he is discharged.If he discovers a fact inconsistent with that book, so much the worse
for the fact, and especially for the discoverer of the fact.He must not
corrupt the minds of his pupils with demonstrations.He must beware
of every truth that cannot, in some way, be made to harmonize with the
superstitions of the Jews.Church and School Divorced

Our country will never be filled with great institutions of learning
until there is an absolute divorce between church and school.As long
as the mutilated records of a barbarous people are placed by priest and
professor above the reason of mankind, we shall reap but little benefit
from church or school.Laws That Want Repealing

All laws defining and punishing blasphemy--making it a crime to give
your honest ideas about the Bible, or to laugh at the ignorance of
the ancient Jews, or to enjoy yourself on the Sabbath, or to give your
opinion of Jehovah, were passed by impudent bigots, and should be at
once repealed by honest men.Government Secular

Our government should be entirely and purely secular.The religious
views of a candidate should be kept entirely out of sight.He should not
be compelled to give his opinion as to the inspiration of the bible,
the propriety of infant baptism, or the immaculate conception.He should be allowed to settle such
things for himself.In 1876, our forefathers retired God from politics.They said all
power comes from the people.They kept God out of the Constitution, and
allowed each State to settle the question for itself.Candidates Made Hypocrites

Candidates are forced to pretend that they are Catholics with Protestant
proclivities, or Christians with liberal tendencies, or temperance men
who now and then take a glass of wine, or, that although not members of
any church their wives are, and that they subscribe liberally to
all.The result of all this is that we reward hypocrisy and elect men
entirely destitute of real principle; and this will never change until
the people become grand enough to allow each other to do their own
thinking.The Church and the Throne

So our fathers said: "We shall form a secular government, and under the
flag with which we are going to enrich the air, we will allow every man
to worship God as he thinks best."They said: "Religion is an individual
thing between each man and his Creator, and he can worship as he pleases
and as he desires."The history of the world
warned them that the liberty of man was not safe in the clutch and grasp
of any church.They had read of and seen the thumbscrews, the racks and
the dungeons of the inquisition.They knew all about the hypocrisy of
the olden time.They knew that the church had stood side by side with
the throne; that the high priests were hypocrites, and that the kings
were robbers.They also knew that if they gave to any church power, it
would corrupt the best church in the world.And so they said that power
must not reside in a church, nor in a sect, but power must be wherever
humanity is--in the great body of the people.And the officers and
servants of the people must be responsible.And so I say again, as
I said in the commencement, this is the wisest, the profoundest, the
bravest political document that ever was written and signed by man.The Old Idea

What was the old idea?The old idea was that no political power came
from, nor in any manner belonged to, the people.The old idea was that
the political power came from the clouds; that the political power came
in some miraculous way from heaven; that it came down to kings, and
queens, and robbers.The nobles lived upon the
labor of the people; the people had no rights; the nobles stole what
they had and divided with the kings, and the kings pretended to divide
what they stole with God Almighty.The source, then, of political power
was from above.The people were responsible to the nobles, the nobles to
the king, and the people had no political rights whatever, no more than
the wild beasts of the forest.The kings were responsible to God, not to
the people.The kings were responsible to the clouds, not to the toiling
millions they robbed and plundered.Liberty for Politicians

I would like also to liberate the politician.At present, the successful
office-seeker is a good deal like the centre of the earth; he weighs
nothing himself, but draws everything else to him.There are so many
societies, so many churches, so many isms, that it is almost impossible
for an independent man to succeed in a political career.Tax all Church Property

I am in favor of the taxation of all church property.If that property
belongs to God, he is able to pay the tax.If we exempt anything, let
us exempt the home of the widow and orphan.The church has to-day
$600,000,000 or $700,000,000 of property in this country.It must cost
$2,000,000 a week, that is to say $500 a minute to run these churches.You give me this money and if I don't do more good with it than
four times as many churches I'll resign.Let them make the churches
attractive and they'll get more hearers.They will have less empty pews
if they have less empty heads in the pulpit.The time will come when the
preacher will become a teacher.The Source of Power

The Declaration of Independence announces the sublime truth, that all
power comes from the people.This was a denial, and the first denial of
a nation, of the infamous dogma that God confers the right upon one man
to govern others.It was the first grand assertion of the dignity of the
human race.It declared the governed to be the source of power, and in
fact denied the authority of any and all gods.The Best Blood of the Old Word come to the New

The kings of the old world endeavored to parcel out this land to their
favorites.There was too much courage
required for them to take and keep it, and so men had to come here
who were dissatisfied with the old country--who were dissatisfied
with England, dissatisfied with France, with Germany, with Ireland and
Holland.Men came here for liberty,
and on account of certain principles they entertained and held dearer
than life.And they were willing to work, willing to fell the forests,
to fight the savages, willing to go through all the hardships, perils
and dangers of a new country, of a new land; and the consequences was
that our country was settled by brave and adventurous spirits, by men
who had opinions of their own, and were willing to live in the wild
forests for the sake of expressing those opinions, even if they
expressed them only to trees, rocks, and savage men.The best blood of
the old world came to the new.No State Church

Happily for us, there was no church strong enough to dictate to the
rest.Fortunately for us, the colonists not only, but the colonies
differed widely in their religious views.There were the Puritans who
hated the Episcopalians, and Episcopalians who hated the Catholics,
and the Catholics who hated both, while the Quakers held them all in
contempt.There they were of every sort, and color, and kind, and how
was it that they came together?They
wanted to form a new nation.More than that, most of them cordially
hated Great Britain; and they pledged each other to forget these
religious prejudices, for a time at least, and agreed that there should
be only one religion until they got through, and that was the religion
of patriotism.They solemnly agreed that the new nation should not
belong to any particular church, but that it should secure the rights of
all.The Enthusiasts of 1776

These grand men were enthusiasts; and the world has only been raised
by enthusiasts.In every country there have been a few who have given
a national aspiration to the people.The enthusiasts of 1776 were the
builders and framers of this great and splendid government; and they
were the men who saw, although others did not, the golden fringe of the
mantle of glory, that will finally cover this world.They knew, they
felt, they believed they would give a new constellation to the political
heavens--that they would make the Americans a grand people--grand as
the continent upon which they lived.The Church Must Have no Sword

Our fathers founded the first secular government that was ever founded
in this world.The first secular government; the first
government that said every church has exactly the same rights and no
more.In other words our fathers were the first men who had the sense,
had the genius, to know that no church should be allowed to have a
sword; that it should be allowed only to exert its moral influence.I want the power where some one can use
it.As long as a man is responsible to the people there is no fear of
despotism.And when any man talks about
despotism, you may be sure he wants to steal or be up to devilment.If
we have any sense, we have got to have localization of brain.If we have
any power, we must have centralization.We want centralization of the
right kind.The man we choose for our head wants the army in one hand,
the navy in the other; and to execute the supreme will of the supreme
people.In the long run the nation that is honest, the people that are
industrious, will pass the people that are dishonest, the people that
are idle; no matter what grand ancestry they might have had.To work for others is, in reality, the only way in which a man can work
for himself.Speculators cannot make unless
somebody loses.In the realm of speculation, every success has at least
one victim.The harvest reaped by the farmer benefits all and injures
none.For him to succeed, it is not necessary that some one should fail.The same is true of all producers--of all laborers.State Sovereignty

I despise the doctrine of State sovereignty.I believe in the rights
of the States, but not in the sovereignty of the States.Rising above States as the Alps above valleys
are the rights of man.Rising above the rights of the government even in
this Nation are the sublime rights of the people.Governments are good
only so long as they protect human rights.But the rights of a man never
should be sacrificed upon the altar of the State or upon the altar of
the Nation.The King of America

I am not only in favor of free speech, but I am also in favor of an
absolutely honest ballot.There is one king in this country; there
is one emperor; there is one supreme czar; and that is the legally
expressed will of the majority of the people.The man who casts an
illegal vote, the man who refuses to count a legal vote, poisons the
fountain of power, poisons the spring of justice, and is a traitor to
the only king in this land.I have always said, and I say again, that
the more liberty there is given away the more you have.There is room in
this world for us all; there is room enough for all of our thoughts;
out upon the intellectual sea there is room for every sail, and in the
intellectual air there is space for every wing.A man that exercises a
right that he will not give to others is a barbarian.A State that does
not allow free speech is uncivilized, and is a disgrace to the American
Union.I have been told that during the war we had plenty of money.I saw promises for dollars,
but not dollars.And the greenback, unless you have the gold behind it,
is no more a dollar than a bill of fare is a dinner.You cannot make
a paper dollar without taking a dollar's worth of paper.I want it issued by the government, and I
want behind every one of these dollars either a gold or silver dollar,
so that every greenback under the flag can lift up its hand and swear,
"I know that my redeemer liveth."The Wail of Dead Nations

A government founded upon anything except liberty and justice cannot and
ought not to stand.All the wrecks on either side of the stream of time,
all the wrecks of the great cities, and all the nations that have passed
away--all are a warning that no nation founded upon injustice can stand.From the sand-enshrouded Egypt, from the marble wilderness of Athens,
and from every fallen, crumbling stone of the once mighty Rome, comes
a wail, as it were, the cry that no nation founded upon injustice can
permanently stand.What the Republican Party Did

I am a Republican.I will tell you why: This is the only free government
in the world.The Republican party took
the chains from 4,000,000 of people.The Republican party, with the wand
of progress, touched the auction-block and it became a school-house; The
Republican party put down the rebellion, saved the nation, kept the old
banner afloat in the air, and declared that slavery of every kind should
be exterpated from the face of the continent.Doings of Democrats

I am opposed to the Democratic party, and I will tell you why.Every
State that seceded from the United States was a Democratic State.Every
ordinance of secession that was drawn was drawn by a Democrat.Every man
that endeavored to tear the old flag from the heaven that it enriches
was a Democrat.Every man that tried to destroy the nation was a
Democrat.Every enemy this great republic has had for twenty years has
been a Democrat.Every man that shot Union soldiers was a Democrat.Every man that starved Union soldiers and refused them in the extremity
of death, a crust, was a Democrat.Every man that loved slavery better
than liberty was a Democrat.The man that assassinated Abraham Lincoln
was a Democrat.Every man that sympathized with the assassin--every
man glad that the noblest President ever elected was assassinated, was a
Democrat.Every man that wanted the privilege of whipping another man to make him
work for him for nothing and pay him with lashes on his naked back, was
a Democrat.Every man that raised blood-hounds to pursue human beings
was a Democrat.Every man that clutched from shrieking, shuddering,
crouching mothers, babes from their breasts, and sold them into slavery,
was a Democrat.Every man that impaired the credit of the United States,
every man that swore we would never pay the bonds, every man that swore
we would never redeem the greenbacks, every maligner of his country's
credit, every calumniator of his country's honor, was a Democrat.Every
man that resisted the draft, every man that hid in the bushes and shot
at Union men simply because they were endeavoring to enforce the laws
of their country, was a Democrat.Every man that wept over the corpse of
slavery was a Democrat.The flag that will not protect its protectors is a dirty rag that
contaminates the air in which it waves.The government that will not
defend its defenders is a disgrace to the nations of the world.I am
a Republican because the Republican party says, "We will protect the
rights of American citizens at home, and if necessary we will march
an army into any State to protect the rights of the humblest American
citizen in that State."I am a Republican because that party allows
me to be free--allows me to do my own thinking in my own way.I am a
Republican because it is a party grand enough and splendid enough and
sublime enough to invite every human being in favor of liberty and
progress to fight shoulder to shoulder for the advancement of mankind.It invites the Methodist; it invites the Catholic; it invites the
Presbyterian and every kind of sectarian; it invites the free-thinker;
it invites the infidel, provided he is in favor of giving to every other
human being every chance and every right that he claims for himself.I
am a Republican, I tell you.Every man that tried to spread smallpox and yellow fever
in the North, as the instrumentalities of civilized war, was a Democrat.Soldiers, every scar you have got on your heroic bodies was given you
by a Democrat.Every scar, every arm that is lacking, every limb that
is gone, every scar is a souvenir of a Democrat.Every man that was the enemy of human liberty in this country was a
Democrat.Every man that wanted the fruit of all the heroism of all the
ages to turn to ashes upon the lips--every one was a Democrat.Give Every Man a Chance

Now, my friends, thousands of the Southern people, and thousands of the
Northern Democrats, are afraid that the <DW64>s are going to pass them
in the race for life.Democrat, he will do it unless you attend
to your business.The simple fact that you are white cannot save you
always.You have got to be industrious, honest, to cultivate a justice.If you don't the <DW52> race will pass you, as sure as you live.I am
for giving every man a chance.Shall the people that saved this country rule it?Shall the men who
saved the old flag hold it?Shall the men who saved the ship of state
sail it?or shall the rebels walk her quarter-deck, give the orders
and sink it?Shall a solid South, a united South,
united by assassination and murder, a South solidified by the shot-gun;
shall a united South, with the aid of a divided North, shall they
control this great and splendid country?Well, then, the North must
wake up.We are right back where we were in 1861.This is simply a
prolongation of the war.This is the war of the idea, the other was the
war of the musket.The other was the war of cannon, this is the war of
thought, and we have got to beat them in this war of thought, recollect
that.The question is, Shall the men who endeavored to destroy this
country rule it?Shall the men that said, This is not a nation, have
charge of the nation?The Declaration of Independence

The Declaration of Independence is the grandest, the bravest, and
the profoundest political document that was ever signed by the
representatives of the people.It is the embodiment of physical and
moral courage and of political wisdom.I say physical courage, because
it was a declaration of war against the most powerful nation then on the
globe; a declaration of war by thirteen weak, unorganized colonies; a
declaration of war by a few people, without military stores, without
wealth, without strength, against the most powerful kingdom on the
earth; a declaration of war made when the British navy, at that day the
mistress of every sea, was hovering along the coast of America, looking
after defenseless towns and villages to ravage and destroy.It was made
when thousands of English soldiers were upon our soil, and when the
principal cities of America were in the substantial possession of
the enemy.And so, I say, all things considered, it was the bravest
political document ever signed by man.I have a dream that this world is growing better and better every day
and every year; that there is more charity, more justice, more love
every day.I have a dream that prisons will not always curse the earth;
that the shadow of the gallows will not always fall on the land; that
the withered hand of want will not always be stretched out for charity;
that finally wisdom will sit in the legislature, justice in the courts,
charity will occupy all the pulpits, and that finally the world will be
controlled by liberty and love, by justice and charity.That is my
dream, and if it does not come true, it shall not be my fault.The Column of July

I stood, a little while ago, in the city of Paris, where stood the
Bastile, where now stands the column of July, surmounted by the figure
of Liberty.In its right hand is a broken chain, in its left hand a
hammer; upon its shining forehead a glittering star--and as I looked
upon it I said, such is the Republican party of my country.A Nation of Rascals

Samuel J. Tilden says we are a nation of thieves and rascals.If that is
so he ought to be President.But I denounce him as a calumniator of
my country; a maligner of this nation.This country is
covered with asylums for the aged, the helpless, the insane, the orphan,
the wounded soldiers.Thieves and rascals don't build such things.In the cities of the Atlantic coast this summer, they built floating
hospitals, great ships, and took the little children from the
sub-cellars and narrow, dirty streets of New York city, where the
Democratic party is the strongest--took these poor waifs and put them in
these great hospitals out at sea, and let the breezes of ocean kiss the
rose of health back to their pallid cheeks.Rascals and thieves do not
do so.When Chicago burned, railroads were blocked with the charity of
the American people.Thieves and rascals did not do so.We are a Great People

We are a great people.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen
states to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the
conveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes
two hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves
his friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the
obligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest
sympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for
himself, is the best man.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of the
air, and have given one country to mankind.Mule Equality

Suppose there was a great horse-race here to-day, free to every horse
in the world, and to all the mules, and all the scrubs, and all the
donkeys.At the tap of the drum they come to the line, and the judges
say "it is a go."Let me ask you, what does the blooded horse, rushing
ahead, with nostrils distended, drinking in the breath of his own
swiftness, with his mane flying like a banner of victory, with his veins
standing out all over him, as if a net of life had been cast around
him--with his thin neck, his high withers, his tremulous flanks--what
does he care how many mules and donkeys run on the track?But the
Democratic scrub, with his chuckle-head and lop-ears, with his tail full
of cockle-burs, jumping high and short, and digging in the ground when
he feels the breath of the coming mule on his cockle-bur tail, he is
the chap that jumps the track and says, "I am down on mule equality."My
friends, the Republican party is the blooded horse in this race.There is room in the Republican air for every wing; there is room on
the Republican sea for every sail.Republicanism says to every man: "Let
your soul be like an eagle; fly out in the great dome of thought, and
question the stars for yourself."I am a Republican because it is the only free party that ever existed.It is a party that had a platform as broad as humanity, a platform as
broad as the human race, a party that says you shall have all the
fruit of the labor of your hands, a party that says you may think for
yourself; a party that says no chains for the hands, no fetters for the
soul.Our Government the best on Earth

We all want a good government.We
all want to live in a land where the law is supreme.We desire to live
beneath a flag that will protect every citizen beneath its folds.We
desire to be citizens of a government so great and so grand that it will
command the respect of the civilized world.Most of us are convinced
that our government is the best upon this earth.Will the Second Century of America be as good as the First?Standing here amid the sacred memories of the first, on the golden
threshold of the second, I ask, Will the second century be as good
as the first?I believe it will because we are growing more and more
humane; I believe there is more human kind-ness and a greater desire
to help one another in America, than in all the world besides.The steam
engine--the telegraph--these are but the toys with which science has
been amusing herself.A grander standard of character, of literature and
art.We have now half as many millions of people as we have years.We are struggling more and more to get at the philosophy of
life--trying more and more to answer the questions of the eternal
Sphinx.The second century will be grander than the first.Science found agriculture plowing with a stick--reaping with a
sickle--commerce at the mercy of the treacherous waves and the
inconstant winds--a world without books--without schools--man denying
the authority of reason, employing his ingenuity in the manufacture
of instruments of torture, in building inquisitions and cathedrals.It found the land filled with malicious monks--with persecuting
Protestants, and the burners of men.The glory of science is, that it is
freeing the soul--breaking the mental manacles--getting the brain out
of bondage--giving courage to thought--filling the world with mercy,
justice, and joy.The Tables Turned

For the establishment of facts, the word of man is now considered
far better than the word of God.In the world of science, Jehovah was
superseded by Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler.All that God told
Moses, admitting the entire account to be true, is dust and ashes
compared to the discoveries of Des Cartes, La Place, and Humboldt.In
matters of fact, the Bible has ceased to be regarded as a standard.Science has succeeded in breaking the chains of theology.A few years
ago, science endeavored to show that it was not inconsistent with the
Bible.The tables have been turned, and now, religion is endeavoring to
prove that the Bible is not inconsistent with science.Science Better than a Creed

It seems to me that a belief in the great truths of science are fully as
essential to salvation, as the creed of any church.We are taught that
a man may be perfectly acceptable to God even if he denies the rotundity
of the earth, the Copernican system, the three laws of Kepler, the
indestructibility of matter and the attraction of gravitation.And we
are also taught that a man may be right upon all these questions, and
yet, for failing to believe in the "scheme of salvation," be eternally
lost.The Religion of Science

Every assertion of individual independence has been a step toward
infidelity.Luther started toward Humboldt,--Wesley, toward John Stuart
Mill.To really reform the church is to destroy it.Every new religion
has a little less superstition than the old, so that the religion of
science is but a question of time.Science not Sectarian

The sciences are not sectarian.People do not persecute each other on
account of disagreements in mathematics.Families are not divided about
botany, and astronomy does not even tend to make a man hate his father
and mother.It is what people do not know, that they persecute each
other about.Science will bring, not a sword, but peace.The Epitaph of all Religions

Science has written over the high altar its mene, mene, tekel,
UPHARSIN--the old words, destined to be the epitaph of all religions?The Real Priest

When we abandon the doctrine that some infinite being created matter
and force, and enacted a code of laws for their government, the idea
of interference will be lost.The real priest will then be, not the
mouth-piece of some pretended deity, but the interpreter of nature.From
that moment the church ceases to exist.The tapers will die out upon the
dusty altar; the moths will eat the fading velvet of pulpit and pew;
the Bible will take its place with the Shastras, Puranas, Vedas, Eddas,
Sagas and Korans, and the fetters of a degrading faith will fall from
the minds of men.Science is Power

From a philosophical point of view, science is knowledge of the laws
of life; of the conditions of happiness; of the facts by which we are
surrounded, and the relations we sustain to men and things--by means
of which, man, so to speak, subjugates nature and bends the elemental
powers to his will, making blind force the servant of his brain.Science Supreme

The element of uncertainty will, in a great measure, be removed from the
domain of the future, and man, gathering courage from a succession of
victories over the obstructions of nature, will attain a serene grandeur
unknown to the disciples of any superstition.The plans of mankind will
no longer be interfered with by the finger of a supposed omnipotence,
and no one will believe that nations or individuals are protected or
destroyed by any deity whatever.Science, freed from the chains of pious
custom and evangelical prejudice, will, within her sphere, be supreme.The mind will investigate without reverence, and publish its conclusions
without fear.Agassiz will no longer hesitate to declare the Mosaic
cosmogony utterly inconsistent with the demonstrated truths of geology,
and will cease pretending any reverence for the Jewish scriptures.The
moment science succeeds in rendering the church powerless for evil, the
real thinkers will be outspoken.The little flags of truce carried by
timid philosophers will disappear, and the cowardly parley will give
place to victory--lasting and universal.Science Opening the Gates of Thought

We are not endeavoring to chain the future, but to free the present.We
are not forging fetters for our children, but we are breaking those our
fathers made for us.We are the advocates of inquiry, of investigation
and thought.This of itself, is an admission that we are not perfectly
satisfied with all our conclusions.Philosophy has not the egotism of
faith.While superstition builds walls and creates obstructions, science
opens all the highways of thought.Stars and Grains of Sand

We do not say that we have discovered all; that our doctrines are the
all in all of truth.We know of no end to the development of man.We
cannot unravel the infinite complications of matter and force.The
history of one monad is as unknown as that of the universe; one drop of
water is as wonderful as all the seas; one leaf, as all the forests; and
one grain of sand, as all the stars.The Trinity of Science

Reason, Observation and Experience--the Holy Trinity of Science--have
taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is
now, and the way to be happy is to make others so.In this belief we are content to live and die.If by any possibility
the existence of a power superior to, and independent of, nature shall
be demonstrated, there will then be time enough to kneel.Until then,
let us all stand nobly erect.The Old and the New Old ideas perished in the retort of the
chemist, and useful truths took their places.One by one religious
conceptions have been placed in the crucible of science, and thus far,
nothing but dross has been found.A new world has been discovered by the
microscope; everywhere has been found the infinite; in every direction
man has investigated and explored, and nowhere, in earth or stars,
has been found the footstep of any being superior to or independent
of nature.Nowhere has been discovered the slightest evidence of any
interference from without.The Triumphs of Science

I do not know what inventions are in the brain of the future; I do not
know what garments of glory may be woven for the world in the loom of
years to be; we are just on the edge of the great ocean of discovery.I
do not know what is to be discovered; I do not know what science will do
for us.I do know that science did just take a handful of sand and make
the telescope, and with it read all the starry leaves of heaven; I know
that science took the thunderbolts from the hands of Jupiter, and now
the electric spark, freighted with thought and love, flashes under the
waves of the sea; I know that science stole a tear from the cheek of
unpaid labor, converted it into steam, and created a giant that turns
with tireless arms the countless wheels of toil; I know that science
broke the chains from human limbs and gave us instead the forces of
nature for our slaves; I know that we have made the attraction of
gravitation work for us; we have made the lightnings our messengers; we
have taken advantage of fire and flames and wind and sea; these slaves
have no backs to be whipped; they have no hearts to be lacerated; they
have no children to be stolen, no cradles to be violated.I know that
science has given us better houses; I know it has given us better
pictures and better books; I know it has given us better wives and
better husbands, and more beautiful children.I know it has enriched
a thousand-fold our life; and therefore I am in favor of perfect
intellectual liberty.It found the world at the mercy of disease and famine; men trying to
read their fates in the stars, and to tell their fortunes by signs and
wonders; generals thinking to conquer their enemies by making the sign
of the cross, or by telling a rosary.It found all history full of petty
and ridiculous falsehood, and the Almighty was supposed to spend most
of his time turning sticks into snakes, drowning boys for swimming on
Sunday, and killing little children for the purpose of converting their
parents.It found the earth filled with slaves and tyrants, the people
in all countries downtrodden, half naked, half starved, without hope,
and without reason in the world.Science the only Lever

Such was the condition of man when the morning of science dawned upon
his brain, and before he had heard the sublime declaration that the
universe is governed by law.For the change that has taken place we are
indebted solely to science--the only lever capable of raising mankind.Abject faith is barbarism; reason is civilization.To obey is slavish;
to act from a sense of obligation perceived by the reason, is noble.Ignorance worships mystery; Reason explains it: the one grovels, the
other soars.I have sometimes wished that there were words of pure hatred out of
which I might construct sentences like snakes, out of which I might
construct sentences with mouths fanged, that had forked tongues, out of
which I might construct sentences that writhed and and hissed; then I
could give my opinion of the rebels during the great struggle for the
preservation of this nation.Slavery in the Name of Religion

Just think of it!Our churches and best people, as they call themselves,
defending the institution of slavery.When I was a little boy I used
to see steamers go down the Mississippi river with hundreds of men and
women chained hand to hand, and even children, and men standing about
them with whips in their hands and pistols in their pockets in the name
of liberty, in the name of civilization and in the name of religion!I
used to hear them preach to these slaves in the South and the only text
they ever took was "Servants be obedient unto your masters."That was
the salutation of the most merciful God to a man whose back was bleeding
that was the salutation of the most merciful God to the slave-mother
bending over an empty cradle, to the woman from whose breast a child
had been stolen--"Servants be obedient unto your masters."That was
what they said to a man running for his life and for his liberty through
tangled swamps and listening to the baying of blood-hounds, and when
he listened for them the voice came from heaven:--"Servants be obedient
unto your masters."Think how we have crouched and cringed before wealth even!How
they used to cringe in old times before a man who was rich--there are so
many of them gone into bankruptcy lately that we are losing a little of
our fear.The Patrons of Slavery

It is not possible for the human imagination to conceive of the horrors
of slavery.It has left no possible wrong uncommitted, no possible crime
un-perpetrated.It has been practiced and defended by all nations in
some form.It has been defended
by nearly every pulpit.From the profits derived from the slave trade,
churches have been built, cathedrals reared and priests paid.Slavery
has been blessed by bishop, by cardinal and by pope.It has received the
sanction of statesmen, of kings, of queens.Clergymen have taken their part of the spoil, reciting passages
of scripture in its defense, and judges have taken their portion in the
name of equity and law.A <DW52> Man in Congress

The world has changed!I have had the supreme pleasure of seeing a
man--once a slave--sitting in the seat of his former master in the
Congress of the United States.When I saw that sight, my eyes were
filled with tears.I felt that we had carried out the Declaration of
Independence, that we had given reality to it, and breathed the breath
of life into every word.I felt that our flag would float over and
protect the <DW52> man and his little children--standing straight in
the sun--just the same as though he were white and worth a million!The Zig-zag Strip

I have some excuses to offer for the race to which I belong.My first
excuse is that this is not a very good world to raise folks in anyway.It is not very well adapted to raising magnificent people.There's only
a quarter of it land to start with.It is three times better for raising
fish than folks; and in that one-quarter of land there is not a tenth
part fit to raise people on.You can't raise people without a good
climate.You have got to have the right kind of climate, and you have
got to have certain elements in the soil or you can't raise good people.Do you know that there is only a little zig-zag strip around the world
within which have been produced all men of genius?Black People have Suffered Enough

In my judgment the black people have suffered enough.They have been
slaves for two hundred years.They have been owned two hundred years,
and, more than all, they have been compelled to keep the company of
those who owned them.Think of being compelled to keep the society of
the man who is stealing from you.Think of being compelled to live with
a man that stole your child from the cradle before your very eyes.Think
of being compelled to live with a thief all your life, to spend your
days with a white loafer, and to be under his control.The History of Civilization

The history of civilization is the history of the slow and painful
enfranchisement of the human race.In the olden times the family was a
monarchy, the father being the monarch.The mother and children were the
veriest slaves.The will of the father was the supreme law.He had the
power of life and death.It took thousands of years to civilize this
father, thousands of years to make the condition of the wife and mother
and children even tolerable.A few families constituted a tribe; the
tribe had a chief; the chief was a tyrant; a few tribes formed a nation;
the nation was governed by a king, who was also a tyrant.A strong
nation robbed, plundered and took captive the weaker ones.Is there, in the civilized world, to-day, a clergyman who believes
in the divinity of slavery?Does the Bible teach man to enslave his
brother?If it does, is it not blasphemous to say that it is inspired
of God?If you find the institution of slavery upheld in a book said
to have been written by God, what would you expect to find in a book
inspired by the devil?Would you expect to find that book in favor of
liberty?Modern Christians, ashamed of the God of the Old Testament,
endeavor now to show that slavery was neither commanded nor opposed by
Jehovah.Solemn Defiance

For my part, I never will, I never can, worship a God who upholds the
institution of slavery.I neither want his
heaven, nor fear his hell.The Soldiers of the Republic

The soldiers of the Republic were not seekers after vulgar glory.They
were not animated by the hope of plunder or the love of conquest.They
fought to preserve the blessings of liberty and that their children
might have peace.They were the defenders of humanity, the destroyers
of prejudice, the breakers of chains, and in the name of the future they
slew the monster of their time.They blotted from the statute books laws that
had been passed by hypocrites at the instigation of robbers, and tore
with indignant hands from the Constitution that infamous clause that
made men the catchers of their fellow men.They made it possible for
judges to be just, for statesmen to be human, and for politicians to be
honest.They broke the shackles from the limbs of slaves, from the souls
of martyrs, and from the Northern brain.They kept our country on the
map of the world and our flag in heaven.Seven long years of war--fighting for what?For the principle that
all men were created equal--a truth that nobody ever disputed except
a scoundrel; nobody in the entire history of this world.No man ever
denied that truth who was not a rascal, and at heart a thief; never,
never, and never will.Simply that in
America every man should have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.Nobody ever denied that except a villain; never, never.It has been denied by kings--they were thieves.It has been denied by
statesmen--they were liars.It has been denied by priests, by clergymen,
by cardinals, by bishops and by popes--they were hypocrites.For the idea that all political power is vested
in the great body of the people.They make all the money; do all the
work.They plow the land; cut down the forests; they produce everything
that is produced.Then who shall say what shall be done with what is
produced except the producer?The Revolution Consummated

The soldiers of the Republic finished what the soldiers of the
Revolution commenced.They relighted the torch that fell from their
august hands and filled the world again with light.The soldiers went home to their waiting wives, to their glad children,
and to the girls they loved--they went back to the fields, the shops and
mines.They were
as honest in peace as they had been brave in war.Mocking at poverty,
laughing at reverses, they made a friend of toil.They said: "We saved
the nation's life, and what is life without honor?"They worked and
wrought with all of labor's sons, that every pledge the nation gave
should be redeemed.And their great leader, having put a shining hand of
friendship--a girdle of clasped and happy hands--around the globe, comes
home and finds that every promise made in war has now the ring and gleam
of gold.Manhood worth more than Gold

We say in this country manhood is worth more than gold.We say in this
country that without liberty the Nation is not worth preserving.I
appeal to every laboring man, and I ask him, "Is there another country
on this globe where you can have your equal rights with others?"Now,
then, in every country, no matter how good it is, and no matter how bad
it is--in every country there is something worth preserving, and there
is something that ought to be destroyed.Now recollect that every voter
is in his own right a king; every voter in this country wears a crown;
every voter in this country has in his hands the scepter of authority;
and every voter, poor and rich, wears the purple of authority alike.Recollect it; and the man that will sell his vote is the man that
abdicates the American throne.Grander than the Greek, nobler than the Roman, the soldiers of the
republic, with patriotism as taintless as the air, battled for the
rights of others; for the nobility of labor; fought that mothers might
own their babes; that arrogant idleness should not scar the back of
patient toil, and that our country should not be a many-headed monster
made of warring States, but a Nation, sovereign, great and free.Blood
was water; money, leaves, and life was common air until one flag floated
over a republic without a master and without a slave.Let us Drink to the Living and the Dead

The soldiers of the Union saved the South as well as the North.Their victory made us free and rendered tyranny in
every other land as insecure as snow upon volcano lips.And now let us
drink to the volunteers, to those who sleep in unknown, sunken graves,
whose names are only in the hearts of those they loved and left--of
those who only hear in happy dreams the footsteps of return.Let us
drink to those who died where lipless famine mocked at want--to all the
maimed whose scars give modesty a tongue, to all who dared and gave to
chance the care and keeping of their lives--to all the living and all
the dead--to Sherman, to Sheridan and to Grant, the foremost soldiers of
the world; and last, to Lincoln, whose loving life, like a bow of peace,
spans and arches all the clouds of war.Will the Wounds of the War be Healed?There is still another question: "Will all the wounds of the war be
healed?"The Southern people must submit, not to the
dictation of the North, but to the nation's will and to the verdict of
mankind.They were wrong, and the time will come when they will say
that they have been vanquished by the right.Freedom conquered them, and
freedom will cultivate their fields, educate their children, weave for
them the robes of wealth, execute their laws, and fill their land with
happy homes.Saviours of the Nation

They rolled the stone from the sepulchre of progress, and found therein
two angels clad in shining garments--nationality and liberty.The
soldiers were the Saviours of the Nation.In writing the proclamation of emancipation, Lincoln, greatest
of our mighty dead, whose memory is as gentle as the summer air,--when
reapers sing'mid gathered sheaves,--copied with the pen what Grant and
his brave comrades wrote with swords.General Grant

When the savagery of the lash, the barbarism of the chain, and the
insanity of secession confronted the civilization of our century, the
question, "Will the great republic defend itself?"trembled on the
lips of every lover of mankind.The North, filled with intelligence and
wealth, products of liberty, marshalled her hosts and asked only for
a leader.From civil life a man, silent, thoughtful, poised, and calm;
stepped forth, and with the lips of victory voiced the nation's first
and last demand: "Unconditional and immediate surrender."From that
moment the end was known.That utterance was the real declaration of
real war and in accordance with the dramatic unities of mighty
events, the great soldier who made it, received the final sword of the
rebellion.The soldiers of the republic were not seekers after vulgar
glory; they were not animated by the hope of plunder or the love of
conquest.They fought to preserve the homestead of liberty.MONEY THAT IS MONEY




142.Paper is not Money

Some people tell me that the government can impress its sovereignty on
a piece of paper, and that is money.Well, if it is, what's the use of
wasting it making one dollar bills?It takes no more ink and no more
paper--why not make $1000 bills?Why not make $100,000,000 and all be
billionaires?If the government can make money, what on earth does it
collect taxes for you and me for?Why don't it make what money it wants,
take the taxes out, and give the balance to us?Greenbacker, suppose
the government issued $1,000,000,000 to-morrow, how would you get any of
it?The Debt will be paid

It will be paid.The holders of the debt have got a mortgage on a
continent.They have a mortgage on the honor of the Republican party,
and it is on record.Every blade of grass that grows upon this continent
is a guarantee that the debt will be paid; every field of bannered corn
in the great, glorious West is a guarantee that the debt will be paid;
all the coal put away in the ground, millions of years ago by the old
miser, the sun; is a guarantee that every dollar of that debt will be
paid; all the cattle on the prairies, pastures and plains, every one of
them is a guarantee that this debt will be paid; every pine standing
in the sombre forests of the North, waiting for the woodman's axe, is
a guarantee that this debt will be paid; all the gold and silver hid in
the Sierra Nevadas, waiting for the miner's pick, is a guarantee that
the debt will be paid; every locomotive, with its muscles of iron and
breath of flame, and all the boys and girls bending over their books at
school, every dimpled child in the cradle, every good man and every good
woman, and every man that votes the Republican ticket, is a guarantee
that the debt will be paid.No man can imagine, all the languages of the world cannot express, what
the people of the United States suffered from 1873 to 1879.Men who
considered themselves millionaires found that they were beggars; men
living in palaces, supposing they had enough to give sunshine to the
winter of their age, supposing they had enough to have all they loved
in affluence and comfort, suddenly found that they were mendicants with
bonds, stocks, mortgages, all turned to ashes in their aged, trembling
hands.The chimneys grew cold, the fires in furnaces went out, the poor
families were turned adrift, and the highways of the United States were
crowded with tramps.Into the home of the poor crept the serpent of
temptation, and whispered in the ear of poverty the terrible word
"repudiation."A Voter because a Man

A man does not vote in this country simply because he is rich; he does
not vote in this country simply because he has an education; he does
not vote simply because he has talent or genius; we say that he votes
because he is a man, and that he has his manhood to support; and we
admit in this country that nothing can be more valuable to any human
being than his manhood, and for that reason we put poverty on an
equality with wealth.If you are a German, recollect that this country is kinder to you than
your own fatherland,--no matter what country you came from, remember
that this country is an asylum, and vote as in your conscience you
believe you ought to vote to keep this flag in heaven.I beg every
American to stand with that part of the country that believes in law, in
freedom of speech, in an honest vote, in civilization, in progress, in
human liberty, and in universal justice.Prosperity and Resumption hand in hand

The Republicans of the United States demand a man who knows that
prosperity and resumption, when they come, must come together; that when
they come they will come hand in hand through the golden harvest fields;
hand in hand by the whirling spindles and the turning wheels; hand in
hand past the open furnace doors; hand in hand by the chimneys filled
with eager fire, greeted and grasped by the countless sons of toil.This money has to be dug out of the earth.You cannot make it by passing
resolutions in a political convention.Every Poor Man should Stand by the Government

It is the only Nation where the man clothed in a rag stands upon an
equality with the one wearing purple.It is the only country in the
world where, politically, the hut is upon an equality with the palace.For that reason, every poor man should stand by the government, and
every poor man who does not is a traitor to the best interests of his
children; every poor man who does not is willing his children should
bear the badge of political inferiority; and the only way to make this
government a complete and perfect success is for the poorest man to
think as much of his manhood as the millionaire does of his wealth.I want to tell you that you cannot conceive of what the American people
suffered as they staggered over the desert of bankruptcy from 1873 to
1879.We are too near now to know how grand we were.The poor mechanic said
"No;" the ruined manufacturer said "No;" the once millionaire said "No,
we will settle fair; we will agree to pay whether we ever pay or
not, and we will never soil the American name with the infamous word,
'repudiation.'"Are you not glad
that our flag is covered all over with financial honors?The stars shine
and gleam now because they represent an honest nation.A Government with a Long Arm

I believe in a Government with an arm long enough to reach the collar
of any rascal beneath its flag.I want it with an arm long enough and
a sword sharp enough to strike down tyranny wherever it may raise its
snaky head.I want a nation that can hear the faintest cries of its
humblest citizen.I want a nation that will protect a freedman standing
in the sun by his little cabin, just as quick as it would protect
Vanderbilt in a palace of marble and gold.No Repudiation

Then it was, that the serpent of temptation whispered in the ear of want
that dreadful word "Repudiation."They
appealed to want, to misery, to threatened financial ruin, to the bare
hearthstones, to the army of beggars, We had grandeur enough to say:
"No; we'll settle fair if we don't pay a cent!"Is there a Democrat now who wishes we had taken the advice of
Bayard to scale the bonds?Is there an American, a Democrat here, who
is not glad we escaped the stench and shame of repudiation, and did not
take Democratic advice?Is there a Greenbacker here who is not glad we
didn't do it?He may say he is, but he isn't.I think there is the greatest heroism in living for a thing!There's no
glory in digging potatoes.You don't wear a uniform when you're picking
up stones.You can't have a band of music when you dig potatoes!In,
1873 came the great crash.No one can estimate the anguish of that time!Millionaires found
themselves paupers.The aged man,
who had spent his life in hard labor, and who thought he had accumulated
enough to support himself in his old age, and leave a little something
to his children and grandchildren, found they were all beggars.The
highways were filled with tramps.Promises Don't Pay

If I am fortunate enough to leave a dollar when I die, I want it to be
a good one; I don't wish to have it turn to ashes in the hands of
widowhood, or become a Democratic broken promise in the pocket of the
orphan; I want it money.I saw not long ago a piece of gold bearing the
stamp of the Roman Empire.That Empire is dust, and over it has been
thrown the mantle of oblivion, but that piece of gold is as good as
though Julius Caesar were still riding at the head of the Roman Legion.I want money to that will outlive the Democratic party.They told
us--and they were honest about it--they said, "when we have plenty of
money we are prosperous."And I said: "When we are prosperous, then we
have credit, and, credit inflates the currency.Whenever a man buys a
pound of sugar and says, 'Charge it,' he inflates the currency; whenever
he gives his note, he inflates the currency; whenever his word takes the
place of money, he inflates the currency."The consequence is that when
we are prosperous, credit takes the place of money, and we have what
we call "plenty."But you can't increase prosperity simply by using
promises to pay.I do not wish to trust the wealth of this nation with the demagogues of
the nation.I do not wish to trust the wealth of the country to every
blast of public opinion.I want money as solid as the earth on which we
tread, as bright as the stars that shine above us.The South and the Tariff

Where did this doctrine of a tariff for revenue only come from?The South would like to stab the prosperity of the North.They
had rather trade with Old England than with New England.They had rather
trade with the people who were willing to help them in war than those
who conquered the rebellion.They knew what gave us our strength in
war.They knew all the brooks and creeks and rivers in New England were
putting down the rebellion.They knew that every wheel that turned,
every spindle that revolved, was a soldier in the army of human
progress.They were so lured by the greed of office that
they were willing to trade upon the misfortune of a nation.I don't wish to belong to a party that succeeds only when my country
falls.I don't wish to belong to a party whose banner went up with
the banner of rebellion.I don't wish to belong to a party that was in
partnership with defeat and disaster.I am for Protection

And I will tell you why I am for protection, too.If we were all farmers
we would be stupid.If we were all shoemakers we would be stupid.If
we all followed one business, no matter what it was, we would become
stupid.Protection to American labor diversifies American industry, and
to have it diversified touches and developes every part of the human
brain.Protection protects integrity; it protects intelligence; and
protection raises sense; and by protection we have greater men and
better-looking women and healthier children.Free trade means that our
laborer is upon an equality with the poorest paid labor of this world.The Old Woman of Tewksbury

You Greenbackers are like the old woman in the Tewksbury, Mass.,
Poor-House.She used to be well off, and didn't like her quarters.You
Greenbackers have left your father's house of many mansions and have fed
on shucks about long enough.The Supervisor came into the Poor-House one
day and asked the old lady how she liked it.She said she didn't like
the company, and asked him what he would advise her to do under similar
circumstances."Do you think anybody is ever prejudiced in their sleep?"I dreamed I died and went to
Heaven.A nice man came to me and asked
me where I was from.Says I, 'From Tewksbury, Mass.'He looked in his
book and said, 'You can't stay here.'"I asked what he would advise me
to do under similar circumstances."'Well,' he said, 'there's hell down
there, you might try that.'"Well, I went down there, and the men told
me my name wasn't on the book and I couldn't stay there.'Well,' said I,
'What would you advise me to do under similar circumstances?''Said he,
'You'll have to go back to Tewksbury.'And when Green-backers remember
what they once were, you must feel now, when you were forced to join
the Democratic party, as bad as the old lady who had to go back to
Tewksbury.American Muscle, Coined into Gold

I believe in American labor, and I tell you why.The other day a man
told me that we had produced in the United States of America one million
tons of rails.In other
words, the million tons are worth $60,000,000.How much is a ton of iron
worth in the ground?American labor takes 25 cents of
iron in the ground and adds to it $59.75.One million tons of rails, and
the raw material not worth $24,000.We build a ship in the United States
worth $500,000, and the value of the ore in the earth, of the trees in
the great forest, of all that enters into the composition of that ship
bringing $500,000 in gold is only $20,000; $480,000 by American labor,
American muscle, coined into gold; American brains made a legal-tender
the world around.Inflation

I don't blame the man who wanted inflation.I don't blame him for
praying for another period of inflation."When it comes," said the man
who had a lot of shrunken property on his hands, "blame me, if I don't
unload, you may shoot me."It's a good deal like the game of poker!I
don't suppose any of you know anything about that game!Along towards
morning the fellow who is ahead always wants another deal.The fellow
that is behind says his wife's sick, and he must go home.You ought
to hear that fellow descant on domestic virtue!And the other fellow
accuses him of being a coward and wanting to jump the game.A man whose
dead wood is hung up on the shore in a dry time, wants the water to rise
once more and float it out into the middle of the stream.We have fifty-six thousand
square miles of land--nearly thirty-six million acres.Upon these plains
we can raise enough to feed and clothe twenty million people.Beneath
these prairies were hidden, millions of ages ago, by that old miser, the
sun, thirty-six thousand square miles of coal.The aggregate thickness
of these veins is at least fifteen feet.Think of a column of coal one
mile square and one hundred miles high!What
a sunbeam such a column would be!Think of all this force, willed and
left to us by the dead morning of the world!Think of the fireside of
the future around which will sit the fathers, mothers and children of
the years to be!Think of the sweet and happy faces, the loving and
tender eyes that will glow and gleam in the sacred light of all these
flames!They say that money is a measure of value.A bushel doesn't
measure values.If it measured
values, a bushel of potatoes would be worth as much as a bushel of
diamonds.They used to say,
"there's no use in having a gold yard-stick."You
don't buy the yard-stick.If money bore the same relation to trade as
a yard-stick or half-bushel, you would have the same money when you
got through trading as you had when you begun.A man don't sell
half-bushels.All we want is a little sense about these
things.Some said there
wasn't enough money.That's so; I know what that means myself.They said
if we had more money we'd be more prosperous.The truth is, if we
were more prosperous we'd have more money.They said more money would
facilitate business.Money by Work

How do you get your money?You have got to dig it
out of the ground.In old times there were
some men who thought they could get some way to turn the baser metals
into gold, and old gray-haired men, trembling, tottering on the verge of
the grave, were hunting for something to turn ordinary metals into gold;
they were searching for the fountain of eternal youth, but they did not
find it.No human ear has ever heard the silver gurgle of the spring of
immortal youth.Meat Twice a Year

I have been in countries where the laboring man had meat once a year;
sometimes twice--Christmas and Easter.And I have seen women carrying
upon their heads a burden that no man would like to carry, and at the
same time knitting busily with both hands.And those women lived without
meat; and when I thought of the American laborer I said to myself,
"After all, my country is the best in the world."And when I came back
to the sea and saw the old flag flying in the air, it seemed to me as
though the air from pure joy had burst into blossom.America a Glorious Land

Labor has more to eat and more to wear in the United States than in
any other land of this earth.I want America to produce everything
that Americans need.I want it so if the whole world should declare war
against us, so if we were surrounded by walls of cannon and bayonets and
swords, we could supply all human wants in and of ourselves.I want to
live to see the American woman dressed in American silk; the American
man in everything from hat to boots produced in America by the cunning
hand of the American toiler.How to Spend a Dollar

If you have only a dollar in the world and have got to spend it, spend
it like a man; spend it like a prince, like a king!If you have to spend
it, spend it as though it were a dried leaf, and you were the owner of
unbounded forests.Honesty is Best always and Everywhere

I am next in favor of honest money.I am in favor of gold and silver,
and paper with gold and silver behind it.I believe in silver, because
it is one of the greatest of American products, and I am in favor of
anything that will add to the value of American products.But I want a
silver dollar worth a gold dollar, even if you make it or have to make
it four feet in diameter.No government can afford to be a clipper of
coin.A great Republic cannot afford to stamp a lie upon silver or gold.Honest money, an honest people, an honest Nation.When our money is only
worth 80 cents on the dollar, we feel 20 per cent, below par.When our
money is good we feel good.When our money is at par, that is where we
are.I am a profound believer in the doctrine that for nations as well
as men, honesty is the best, always, everywhere and forever.A Fountain of Greenbacks

There used to be mechanics that tried to make perpetual motion by
combinations of wheels, shifting weights, and rolling balls; but somehow
the machine would never quite run.A perpetual fountain of greenbacks,
of wealth without labor, is just as foolish as a fountain of eternal
youth.The idea that you can produce money without labor is just as
foolish as the idea of perpetual motion.They are old follies under new
names.We had to borrow some money to pay for shot and
shell to shoot Democrats with.We found that we could get along with a
few less Democrats, but not with any less country, and so we borrowed
the money, and the question now is, will we pay it?And which party is
the most apt to pay it, the Republican party, that made the debt--the
party that swore it was constitutional, or the party that said it was
unconstitutional?Whenever a Democrat sees a greenback, the greenback
says to the Democrat, "I am one of the fellows that whipped you."Whenever a Republican sees a greenback, the greenback says to him, "You
and I put down the rebellion and saved the country."Honest Methods

So many presidents of savings banks, even those belonging to the Young
Men's Christian Association, run off with the funds; so many railroad
and insurance companies are in the hands of receivers; there is so much
bankruptcy on every hand, that all capital is held in the nervous clutch
of fear.Slowly, but surely, we are coming back to honest methods in
business.Confidence will return, and then enterprise will unlock the
safe and money will again circulate as of yore; the dollars will leave
their hitting places, and every one will be seeking investment.For my part I do not ask any interference on the part of the government
except to undo the wrong it has done.I do not ask that money be made
out of nothing.I do not ask for the prosperity born of paper.But I do
ask for the remonetization of silver.It was an imposition upon every solvent man; a fraud upon every honest
debtor in the United States.It was done in the
interest of avarice and greed, and should be undone by honest men.RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS




171.Redden your hands with human blood; blast by slander the fair fame
of the innocent; strangle the smiling child upon its mother's knees;
deceive, ruin and desert the beautiful girl who loves and trusts you,
and your case is not hopeless.For all this, and for all these you
may be forgiven.For all this, and for all these, that bankrupt court
established by the gospel, will give you a discharge; but deny the
existence of these divine ghosts, of these gods, and the sweet and
tearful face of Mercy becomes livid with eternal hate.Heaven's golden
gates are shut, and you, with an infinite curse ringing in your
ears, with the brand of infamy upon your brow, commence your endless
wanderings in the lurid gloom of hell--an immortal vagrant--an eternal
outcast--a deathless convict.Faith--A Mixture of Insanity and Ignorance

The doctrine that future happiness depends upon belief is monstrous.It is the infamy of infamies.The notion that faith in Christ is to
be rewarded by an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon reason,
observation, and experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for
refutation, and can be relieved only by that unhappy mixture of insanity
and ignorance; called "faith."The church in the days of Voltaire contended that its servants were the
only legitimate physicians.The priests cured in the name of the church,
and in the name of God--by exorcism, relics, water, salt and oil.Gervasius was good for rheumatism, St.Ovidius
for deafness, St.Apollonia for
toothache, St.Clara for rheum in the eye, St.Devils were driven out with wax tapers, with incence (sp.), with holy
water, by pronouncing prayers.The church, as late as the middle of the
twelfth century, prohibited good Catholics from having anything to do
with physicians.The Sleep of Persecutors

All the persecutors sleep in peace, and the ashes of those who burned
their brothers in the name of Christ rest in consecrated ground.Whole
libraries could not contain even the names of the wretches who have
filled the world with violence and death in defense of book and creed,
and yet they all died the death of the righteous, and no priest or|
minister describes the agony and fear, the remorse and horror with which
their guilty souls were filled in the last moments of their lives.These
men had never doubted; they accepted the creed; they were not infidels;
they had not denied the divinity of Christ; they had been baptized;
they had partaken of the last supper; they had respected priests; they
admitted that the Holy Ghost had "proceeded;" and these things put
pillows beneath their dying heads and covered them with the drapery of
peace.There is no recorded instance where the uplifted hand of murder has been
paralyzed--no truthful account in all the literature of the world of the
innocent shielded by God.Thousands of crimes are being committed every
day--men are this moment lying in wait for their human prey; wives
are whipped and crushed, driven to insanity and death; little children
begging for mercy, lifting imploringly tear-filled eyes to the brutal
faces of fathers and mothers; sweet girls are deceived, lured, and
outraged; but God has no time to prevent these things--no time to defend
the good and to protect the pure.He is too busy numbering hairs and
watching sparrows.All kinds of criminals, except infidels, meet death with reasonable
serenity.As a rule, there is nothing in the death of a pirate to cast
any discredit on his profession.The murderer upon the scaffold, with
a priest on either side, smilingly exhorts the multitude to meet him in
heaven.The man who has succeeded in making his home a hell meets death
without a quiver, provided he has never expressed any doubt as to the
divinity of Christ or the eternal "procession" of the holy ghost.The
king who has waged cruel and useless war, who has filled countries with
widows and fatherless children, with the maimed and diseased, and who
has succeeded in offering to the Moloch of ambition the best and bravest
of his subjects, dies like a saint.The first Corpse and the first Cathedral

Now and then, in the history of this world, a man of genius, of sense,
of intellectual honesty has appeared.These men have denounced the
superstitions of their day.To see priests
devour the substance of the people filled them with indignation.These
men were honest enough to tell their thoughts.Then they were denounced,
condemned, executed.Some of them escaped the fury of the people who
loved their enemies, and died naturally in their beds.It would not be
for the church to admit that they died peacefully.That would show that
religion was not actually necessary in the last moment.Religion got
much of its power from the terror of death.Superstition is the child of
ignorance and fear.The first
corpse was the first priest.It would not do to have the common people
understand that a man could deny the Bible, refuse to look at the cross,
contend that Christ was only a man, and yet die as calmly as Calvin did
after he had murdered Servetus, or as King David, after advising one son
to kill another.The Sixteenth Century

In the sixteenth century every science was regarded as an outcast and an
enemy, and the church influenced the world, which was under its
power, to believe anything, and the ignorant mob was always too ready,
brutalized by the church, to hang, kill or crucify at their bidding.Such was the result of a few centuries of Christianity.An Orthodox Gentleman

By Orthodox I mean a gentleman who is petrified in his mind, whooping
around intellectually, simply to save the funeral expenses of his soul.A Bold Assertion

The churches point to their decayed saints, and their crumbled Popes
and say, "Do you know more than all the ministers that ever lived?"And without the slightest egotism or blush I say, yes, and the name of
Humboldt outweighs them all.The men who stand in the front rank, the
men who know most of the secrets of nature, the men who know most are
to-day the advanced infidels of this world.I have lived long enough to
see the brand of intellectual inferiority on every orthodox brain.If we admit that some infinite being has controlled the destinies of
persons and peoples, history becomes a most cruel and bloody farce.Age after age, the strong have trampled upon the weak; the crafty
and heartless have ensnared and enslaved the simple and innocent,
and nowhere, in all the annals of mankind, has any god succored the
oppressed.Weak ones Suffering--Heaven deaf

Most of the misery has been endured by the weak, the loving and the
innocent.Women have been treated like poisonous beasts, and little
children trampled upon as though they had been vermin.Numberless altars
have been reddened, even with the blood of babes; beautiful girls have
been given to slimy serpents; whole races of men doomed to centuries
of slavery, and everywhere there has been outrage beyond the power
of genius to express.During all these years the suffering have
supplicated; the withered lips of famine have prayed; the pale victims
have implored, and Heaven has been deaf and blind.Heaven has no Ear, no Hand

Man should cease to expect aid from on high.By this time he should know
that heaven has no ear to hear, and no hand to help.The present is the
necessary child of all the past.There has been no chance, and there can
be no interference.Religion is Tyrannical

Religion does not, and cannot, contemplate man as free.She accepts only
the homage of the prostrate, and scorns the offerings of those who stand
erect.The wide and sunny
fields belong not to her domain.The star-lit heights of genius and
individuality are above and beyond her appreciation and power.Her
subjects cringe at her feet, covered with the dust of obedience.Religion and Facts

What has religion to do with facts?Is there any such thing
as Methodist mathematics, Presbyterian botany, Catholic astronomy or
Baptist biology?What has any form of superstition or religion to do
with a fact or with any science?Nothing but hinder, delay or embarass.I want, then, to free the schools; and I want to free the politicians,
so that a man will not have to pretend he is a Methodist, or his wife
a Baptist, or his grandmother a Catholic; so that he can go through
a campaign, and when he gets through will find none of the dust of
hypocrisy on his knees.Religion not the End of Life

We deny that religion is the end or object of this life.When it is so
considered it becomes destructive of happiness--the real end of life.It becomes a hydra-headed monster, reaching in terrible coils from the
heavens, and thrusting its thousand fangs into the bleeding, quivering
hearts of men.It devours their substance, builds palaces for God, (who
dwells not in temples made with hands,) and allows his children to
die in huts and hovels.It fills the earth with mourning, heaven with
hatred, the present with fear, and all the future with despair.Creeds

Just in proportion that the human race has advanced, the Church has lost
power.No nation ever materially
advanced that held strictly to the religion of its founders.No nation
ever gave itself wholly to the control of the Church without losing its
power, its honor, and existence.Every Church pretends to have found
the exact truth.Every creed is a rock in running
water; humanity sweeps by it.Every creed cries to the universe, "Halt!"A creed is the ignorant Past bullying the enlightened Present.The Worst Religion in the World

The worst religion of the world was the Presbyterianism of Scotland as
it existed in the beginning of the eighteenth century.The kirk had all
the faults of the church of Rome, without a redeeming feature.The kirk
hated music, painting, statuary, and architecture.Anything touched with
humanity--with the dimples of joy--was detested and accursed.God was
to be feared, not loved.Happiness was a snare, and human love was wicked,
weak, and vain.The Presbyterian priest of Scotland was as cruel,
bigoted, and heartless as the familiar of the inquisition.In the beginning of this, the nineteenth century, a boy
seventeen years of age, Thomas Aikenhead, was indicted and tried
at Edinburgh for blasphemy.He had on several occasions, when cold,
jocularly wished himself in hell, that he might get warm.The poor,
frightened boy recanted--begged for mercy; but he was found guilty,
hanged, thrown in a hole at the foot of the scaffold; and his weeping
mother vainly begged that his bruised and bleeding body might be given
to her.Religion Demanding Miracles

The founder of a religion must be able to turn water into wine--cure
with a word the blind and lame, and raise with a simple touch the dead
to life.It was necessary for him to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of his barbarian disciple, that he was superior to nature.In times of
ignorance this was easy to do.The credulity of the savage was almost
boundless.To him the marvelous was the beautiful, the mysterious was
the sublime.Consequently, every religion has for its foundation a
miracle--that is to say, a violation of nature--that is to say, a
falsehood.We Want One Fact

We have heard talk enough.We have listened to all the drowsy, idealess,
vapid sermons that we wish to hear.We have read your Bible and the
works of your best minds.We have heard your prayers, your solemn groans
and your reverential amens.We beg at the doors of your churches for just one little
fact.We pass our hats along your pews and under your pulpits and
implore you for just one fact.We know all about your mouldy wonders and
your stale miracles.The Design Argument

These religious people see nothing but designs everywhere, and personal,
intelligent interference in everything.They insist that the universe
has been created, and that the adaptation of means to ends is perfectly
apparent.They point us to the sunshine, to the flowers, to the April
rain, and to all there is of beauty and of use in the world.Did it ever
occur to them that a cancer is as beautiful in its development as is the
reddest rose?That what they are pleased to call the adaptation of
means to ends, is as apparent in the cancer as in the April rain?By what ingenious methods the
blood is poisoned so that the cancer shall have food!By what wonderful
contrivances the entire system of man is made to pay tribute to this
divine and charming cancer!See by what admirable instrumentalities it
feeds itself from the surrounding quivering, dainty flesh!See how it
gradually but surely expands and grows!By what marvelous mechanism
it is supplied with long and slender roots that reach out to the most
secret nerves of pain for sustenance and life!Down, Forever Down

Down, forever down, with any religion that requires upon its ignorant
altar the sacrifice of the goddess Reason, that compels her to abdicate
forever the shining throne of the soul, strips from her form the
imperial purple, snatches from her hand the sceptre of thought and makes
her the bondwoman of a senseless faith!The Back

Upon this rack I have described, this victim was placed, and those
chains were attached to his ankles and then to his waist, and clergyman,
good men pious men!men that were shocked at the immorality of their
day!they talked about playing cards and the horrible crime of dancing!how such things shocked them; men going to the theatres and seeing a
play written by the grandest genius the world ever has produced--how it
shocked their sublime and tender souls!but they commenced turning this
machine and they kept on turning until the ankles, knees, hips, elbows,
shoulders and wrists were all dislocated and the victim was red with the
sweat of agony, and they had standing by a physician to feel the pulse,
so that the last faint flutter of life would not leave his veins.simply that they might
have the pleasure of racking him once again.That is the spirit, and it
is a spirit born of the doctrine that there is upon the throne of the
universe a being who will eternally damn his children, and they said:
"If God is going to have the supreme happiness of burning them forever,
certainly he might not to begrudge to us the joy of burning them for an
hour or two."That was their doctrine, and when I read these things it
seems to me that I have suffered them myself.An Awful Admission

Just think of going to the day of judgment, if there is one, and
standing up before God and admitting without a blush that you had lived
and died a Scotch Presbyterian.I would expect the next sentence would
be, "Depart ye curged into everlasting fire."CHURCHES AND PRIESTS




195.The Church Forbids Investigation

The first doubt was the womb and cradle of progress, and from the first
doubt, man has continued to advance.Men began to investigate, and the
church began to oppose.The astronomer scanned the heavens, while the
church branded his grand forehead with the word, "Infidel;" and now,
not a glittering star in all the vast expanse bears a Christian name.In spite of all religion, the geologist penetrated the earth, read her
history in books of stone, and found, hidden within her bosom souvenirs
of all the ages.The Church Charges Falsely

Notwithstanding the fact that infidels in all ages have battled for
the rights of man, and have at all times been the fearless advocates
of liberty and justice, we are constantly charged by the Church with
tearing down without building again.The Church in the "Dark Ages"

During that frightful period known as the "Dark Ages," Faith reigned,
with scarcely a rebellious subject.Her temples were "carpeted with
knees," and the wealth of nations adorned her countless shrines.The
great painters prostituted their genius to immortalize her vagaries,
while the poets enshrined them in song.At her bidding, man covered the
earth with blood.The scales of Justice were turned with her gold, and
for her use were invented all the cunning instruments of pain.She built
cathedrals for God, and dungeons for men.She peopled the clouds with
angels and the earth with slaves.For ages, a deadly conflict has been waged between a few brave men and
women of thought and genius upon the one side, and the great ignorant
religious mass on the other.The few have appealed to reason, to honor, to law, to freedom, to the
known, and to happiness here in this world.The many have appealed
to prejudice, to fear, to miracle, to slavery, to the unknown, and
to misery hereafter.The many have said,
"Believe!"The Church and the Tree of Knowledge

The gods dreaded education and knowledge then just as they do now.The
church still faithfully guards the dangerous tree of knowledge, and has
exerted in all ages her utmost power to keep mankind from eating the
fruit thereof.The priests have never ceased repeating the old falsehood
and the old threat: "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye die."Let the church, or one of its
intellectual saints, perform a miracle, and we will believe.We are told
that nature has a superior.Let this superior, for one single instant,
control nature and we will admit the truth of your assertions.The Heretics Cried, "Halt!"A few infidels--a few heretics cried, "Halt!"to the great rabble of
ignorant devotion, and made it possible for the genius of the nineteenth
century to revolutionize the cruel creeds and superstitions of mankind.The World not so Awful Flat

According to the Christian system this world was the centre of
everything.The stars were made out of what little God happened to have
left when he got the world done.God lived up in the sky, and they said
this earth must rest upon something, and finally science passed its hand
clear under, and there was nothing.It was self-existent in infinite
space.Then the Church began to say they didn't say it was flat, not so
awful flat--it was kind of rounding.According to the ancient Christians God lived from all eternity, and
never worked but six days in His whole life, and then had the impudence
to tell us to be industrious.Christian nations are the warlike nations of this world.Christians have
invented the most destructive weapons of war.Christianity gave us the
revolver, invented the rifle, made the bombshell; and Christian
nations here and there had above all other arts the art of war; and as
Christians they have no respect for the rights of barbarians or for the
rights of any nation or tribe that happens to differ with them.See what
it does in our society; we are divided off into little sects that used
to discuss these questions with fire and sword, with chain and <DW19>,
and that discuss, some of them, even to-day, with misrepresentation and
slander.Every day something happens to show me that the old spirit that
that was in the inquisition still slumbers in the breasts of men.Another Day of Divine Work

I heard of a man going to California over the plains, and there was a
clergyman on board, and he had a great deal to say, and finally he
fell in conversation with the forty-niner, and the latter said to the
clergyman, "Do you believe that God made this world in six days?"They were then going along the Humboldt.Says he, "Don't you think
he could put in another day to advantage right around here?"The Donkey and the Lion

Owing to the attitude of the churches for the last fifteen hundred
years, truth-telling has not been a very lucrative business.As a rule,
hypocrisy has worn the robes, and honesty the rags.You cannot now answer the argument of a man by pointing at
the holes in his coat.Thomas Paine attacked the Church when it was
powerful--when it had what is called honors to bestow--when it was
the keeper of the public conscience--when it was strong and cruel.The
Church waited till he was dead, and then attacked his reputation and his
clothes.Once upon a time a donkey kicked a lion, but the lion was dead.The Orthodox Christian

The highest type of the orthodox Christian does not forget; neither
does he learn.He is a living fossil
embedded in that rock called faith.He makes no effort to better his
condition, because all his strength is exhausted in keeping other people
from improving theirs.The supreme desire of his heart is to force all
others to adopt his creed, and in order to accomplish this object he
denounces free-thinking as a crime, and this crime he calls heresy.When
he had power, heresy was the most terrible and formidable of words.It
meant confiscation, exile, imprisonment, torture, and death.Alms-Dish and Sword

I will not say the Church has been an unmitigated evil in all respects.It has delighted in the production
of extremes.It has furnished murderers for its own martyrs.It has
sometimes fed the body, but has always starved the soul.It has been a
charitable highwayman--a profligate beggar--a generous pirate.It
has produced some angels and a multitude of devils.It has built more
prisons than asylums.It made a hundred orphans while it cared for one.In one hand it has carried the alms-dish and in the other a sword.The Church the Great Robber

The Church has been, and still is, the great robber.She has rifled not
only the pockets but the brains of the world.She is the stone at the
sepulchre of liberty; the upas tree, in whose shade the intellect of man
has withered; the Gorgon beneath whose gaze the human heart has turned
to stone.Under her influence even the Protestant mother expects to be
happy in heaven, while her brave boy, who fell fighting for the rights
of man, shall writhe in hell.The Church Impotent

The Church, impotent and malicious, regrets, not the abuse, but the loss
of her power, and seeks to hold by falsehood what she gained by cruelty
and force, by fire and fear.Christianity cannot live in peace with any
other form of faith.Toleration

Let it be remembered that all churches have persecuted heretics to the
extent of their power.Toleration has increased only when and where the
power of the church has diminished.From Augustine until now the
spirit of the Christians has remained the same.There has been the same
intolerance, the same undying hatred of all who think for themselves,
and the same determination to crush out of the human brain all knowledge
inconsistent with an ignorant creed.Shakespeare's Plays v. Sermons

What would the church people think if the theatrical people should
attempt to suppress the churches?What harm would it do to have an opera
here tonight?It would elevate us more than to hear ten thousand sermons
on the worm that never dies.There is more practical wisdom in one of
the plays of Shakespeare than in all the sacred books ever written.What
wrong would there be to see one of those grand plays on Sunday?There
was a time when the church would not allow you to cook on Sunday.You
had to eat your victuals cold.There was a time they thought the more
miserable you feel the better God feels.Give any orthodox church the power, and to-day they would punish heresy
with whip, and chain, and fire.As long as a church deems a certain
belief essential to salvation, just so long it will kill and burn if it
has the power.Why should the Church pity a man whom her God hates?Why
should she show mercy to a kind and noble heretic whom her God will burn
in eternal fire?Cathedrals and domes, and chimes and chants--temples frescoed and
groined and carved, and gilded with gold--altars and tapers, and
paintings of virgin and babe--censer and chalice--chasuble, paten
and alb--organs, and anthems and incense rising to the winged and
blest--maniple, amice and stole--crosses and crosiers, tiaras
and crowns--mitres and missals and masses--rosaries, relics and
robes--martyrs and saints, and windows stained as with the blood of
Christ--never, never for one moment awed the brave, proud spirit of the
Infidel.He knew that all the pomp and glitter had been purchased with
Liberty--that priceless jewel of the soul.In looking at the cathedral
he remembered the dungeon.The music of the organ was loud enough to
drown the clank of fetters.He could not forget that the taper had
lighted the fagot.He knew that the cross adorned the hilt of the sword,
and so where others worshiped, he wept and scorned.Back to Chaos

Suppose the Church could control the world today, we would go back to
chaos and old night philosophy would be branded as infamous; science
would again press its pale and thoughtful face against the prison bars,
and round the limbs of liberty would climb the bigot's flame.Infinite Impudence of the Church

Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church assuming to think for
the human race?Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church
that pretends to be the mouthpiece of God, and in his name threatens to
inflict eternal punishment upon those who honestly reject its claims and
scorn its pretensions?By what right does a man, or an organization
of men, or a god, claim to hold a brain in bondage?When a fact can be
demonstrated, force is unnecessary; when it cannot be demonstrated, an
appeal to force is infamous.In the presence of the unknown all have an
equal right to think.Wanted!--A New Method

The world is covered with forts to protect Christians from Christians,
and every sea is covered with iron monsters ready to blow Christian
brains into eternal froth.Millions upon millions are annually expended
in the effort to construct still more deadly and terrible engines of
death.Industry is crippled, honest toil is robbed, and even beggary is
taxed to defray the expenses of Christian warfare.There must be some
other way to reform this world.The Kirk of Scotland

The Church was ignorant, bloody, and relentless.In Scotland the "Kirk"
was at the summit of its power.It was a full sister of the Spanish
Inquisition.It was the enemy of
happiness, the hater of joy, and the despiser of religious liberty.It
taught parents to murder their children rather than to allow them to
propagate error.If the mother held opinions of which the infamous
"Kirk" disapproved, her children were taken from her arms, her babe from
her very bosom, and she was not allowed to see them, or to write them a
word.It would not allow shipwrecked sailors to be rescued from drowning
on Sunday.It sought to annihilate pleasure, to pollute the heart by
filling it with religious cruelty and gloom, and to change mankind into
a vast horde of pious, heartless fiends.One of the most famous Scotch
divines said: "The Kirk holds that religious toleration is not far from
blasphemy."The Church Looks Back

The Church is, and always has been, incapable of a forward movement.The Church has already reduced Spain to a
guitar, Italy to a hand-organ, and Ireland to exile.Diogenes

The Church used painting, music and architecture, simply to degrade
mankind.There have been at all
times brave spirits that dared even the gods.Some proud head has always
been above the waves.In every age some Diogenes has sacrificed to all
the gods.True genius never cowers, and there is always some Samson
feeling for the pillars of authority.The Church and War

It does seem as though the most zealous Christian must at times
entertain some doubt as to the divine origin of his religion.For
eighteen hundred years the doctrine has been preached.For more than
a thousand years the Church had, to a great extent, the control of the
civilized world, and what has been the result?Are the Christian nations
patterns of charity and forbearance?On the contrary, their principal
business is to destroy each other.More than five millions of Christians
are trained, educated, and drilled to murder their fellow-christians.Every nation is groaning under a vast debt incurred in carrying on war
against other Christians.The Call to Preach

An old deacon, wishing to get rid of an unpopular preacher, advised him
to give up the ministry and turn his attention to something else.The
preacher replied that he could not conscientiously desert the pulpit, as
he had had a "call" to the ministry.To which the deacon replied, "That
may be so, but it's very unfortunate for you, that when God called you
to preach, he forgot to call anybody to hear you."Burning Servetus

The maker of the Presbyterian creed caused the fugitive Servetus to be
arrested for blasphemy.He was
convicted and condemned to death by fire.On the morning of the fatal
day, Calvin saw him, and Servetus, the victim, asked forgiveness of
Calvin, the murderer.Servetus was bound to the stake, and the <DW19>s
were lighted.The wind carried the flames somewhat away from his body,
so that he slowly roasted for hours.Vainly he implored a speedy death.At last the flames climbed round his form; through smoke and fire his
murderers saw a white, heroic face.And there they watched until a man
became a charred and shriveled mass.Liberty was banished from Geneva,
and nothing but Presbyterianism was left.Freedom for the Clergy

One of the first things I wish to do is to free the orthodox clergy.I
am a great friend of theirs, and in spite of all they may say against
me, I am going to do them a great and lasting service.Upon their necks
are visible the marks of the collar, and upon their backs those of the
lash.They are not allowed to read and think for themselves.They are
taught like parrots, and the best are those who repeat, with the fewest
mistakes, the sentences they have been taught.They sit like owls upon
some dead limb of the tree of knowledge, and hoot the same old hoots
that have been hooted for eighteen hundred years.The Pulpit Weakening

There was a time when a falsehood, fulminated from the pulpit, smote
like a sword; but, the supply having greatly exceeded the demand,
clerical misrepresentation has at last become almost an innocent
amusement.Remembering that only a few years ago men, women, and even
children, were imprisoned, tortured and burned, for having expressed
in an exceedingly mild and gentle way, the ideas entertained by me, I
congratulate myself that calumny is now the pulpit's last resort.Origin of the Priesthood

This was the origin of the priesthood.The priest pretended to stand
between the wrath of the gods and the helplessness of man.He was man's
attorney at the court of heaven.Sandra went to the hallway.He carried to the invisible world a
flag of truce, a protest and a request.He came back with a command,
with authority and with power.Man fell upon his knees before his own
servant, and the priest, taking advantage of the awe inspired by his
supposed influence with the gods, made of his fellow-man a cringing
hypocrite and slave.The Clergy on Heaven

The clergy, however, balance all the real ills of this life with the
expected joys of the next.We are assured that all is perfection in
heaven--there the skies are cloudless--there all is serenity and peace.Here empires may be overthrown; dynasties may be extinguished in blood;
millions of slaves may toil 'neath the fierce rays of the sun, and the
cruel strokes of the lash; yet all is happiness in heaven.Pestilences
may strew the earth with corpses of the loved; the survivors may bend
above them in agony--yet the placid bosom of heaven is unruffled.Children may expire vainly asking for bread; babes may be devoured by
serpents, while the gods sit smiling in the clouds.The Parson, the Crane and the Fish

A devout clergyman sought every opportunity to impress upon the mind
of his son the fact, that God takes care of all his creatures; that the
falling sparrow attracts his attention, and that his loving-kindness is
over all his works.Happening, one day, to see a crane wading in quest
of food, the good man pointed out to his son the perfect adaptation of
the crane to get his living in that manner."See," said he, "how his
legs are formed for wading!Observe how
nicely he folds his feet when putting them in or drawing them out of
the water!He is thus enabled
to approach the fish without giving them any notice of his arrival.My son," said he, "it is impossible to look at that bird without
recognizing the design, as well as the goodness of God, in thus
providing the means of subsistence.""Yes," replied the boy, "I think I
see the goodness of God, at least so far as the crane is concerned; but,
after all, father, don't you think the arrangement a little tough on the
fish?"Give me the storm of tempest and action, rather than the dead calm of
ignorance and faith.Banish me from Eden when you will; but first let me
eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge!The Pulpit's Cry of Fear

From every pulpit comes the same cry, born of the same fear: "Lest
they eat and become as gods, knowing good and evil."For this reason,
religion hates science, faith detests reason, theology is the sworn
enemy of philosophy, and the church with its flaming sword still guards
the hated tree, and like its supposed founder, curses to the lowest
depths the brave thinkers who eat and become as gods.Restive Clergymen

Some of the clergy have the independence to break away, and the
intellect to maintain themselves as free men, but the most are compelled
to submit to the dictation of the orthodox, and the dead.They are
not employed to give their thoughts, but simply to repeat the ideas of
others.They are not expected to give even the doubts that may suggest
themselves, but are required to walk in the narrow, verdureless path
trodden by the ignorance of the past.The forests and fields on either
side are nothing to them.The Parson Factory at Andover

They have in Massachusetts, at a place called Andover, a kind of
minister-factory; and every professor in that factory takes an oath once
in every five years--that is as long as an oath will last--that not only
has he not during the last five years, but so help him God, he will not
during the next five years intellectually advance; and probably there is
no oath he could easier keep.Since the foundation of that institution
there has not been one case of perjury.They believe the same creed they
first taught when the foundation stone was laid, and now when they send
out a minister they brand him as hardware from Sheffield and Birmingham.And every man who knows where he was educated knows his creed, knows
every argument of his creed, every book that he reads, and just what he
amounts to intellectually, and knows he will shrink and shrivel.A Charge to Presbyteries

Go on, presbyteries and synods, go on!Thrust the heretics out of the
Church--that is to say, throw away your brains,--put out your eyes.Every
deserter from your camp is a recruit for the army of progress.Cling to
the ignorant dogmas of the past; read the 109th Psalm; gloat over the
slaughter of mothers and babes; thank God for total depravity; shower
your honors upon hypocrites, and silence every minister who is touched
with that heresy called genius.Turn out the
astronomers, the geologists, the naturalists, the chemists, and all the
honest scientists.With a whip of scorpions, drive them all out.Nature the True Bible

The true Bible appeals to man in the name of demonstration.It has no fear of being read, of being contradicted,
of being investigated and understood.It does not pretend to be holy, or
sacred; it simply claims to be true.It challenges the scrutiny of
all, and implores every reader to verify every line for himself.It is
incapable of being blasphemed.This book appeals to all the surroundings
of man.Each thing that exists testifies of its perfection.The earth,
with its heart of fire and crowns of snow; with its forests and plains,
its rocks and seas; with its every wave and cloud; with its every leaf
and bud and flower, confirms its every word, and the solemn stars,
shining in the infinite abysses, are the eternal witnesses of its truth.Inspiration

I will tell you what I mean by inspiration.I go and look at the sea,
and the sea says something to me; it makes an impression upon my mind.That impression depends, first, upon my experience; secondly, upon
my intellectual capacity.He has a
different brain, he has had a different experience, he has different
memories and different hopes.The sea may speak to him of joy and to me
of grief and sorrow.The sea cannot tell the same thing to two beings,
because no two human beings have had the same experience.So, when I
look upon a flower, or a star, or a painting, or a statue, the more I
know about sculpture the more that statue speaks to me.The more I have
had of human experience, the more I have read, the greater brain I have,
the more the star says to me.In other words, nature says to me all that
I am capable of understanding.Think of a God wicked and malicious enough to inspire this prayer in
the 109th Psalm.Had this
inspired psalm been found in some temple erected for the worship of
snakes, or in the possession of some cannibal king, written with blood
upon the dried skins of babes, there would have been a perfect harmony
between its surroundings and its sentiments.I Don't Believe the Bible

Now, I read the Bible, and I find that God so loved this world that he
made up his mind to damn the most of us.I have read this book, and what
shall I say of it?I believe it is generally better to be honest.Now,
I don't believe the Bible.They say that if you
do you will regret it when you come to die.If that be true, I know a
great many religious people who will have no cause to regret it--they
don't tell their honest convictions about the Bible.The Bible the Real Persecutor

The Bible was the real persecutor.The Bible burned heretics, built
dungeons, founded the Inquisition, and trampled upon all the liberties
of men.How long, O how long will mankind worship a book?How long will
they grovel in the dust before the ignorant legends of the barbaric
past?How long, O how long will they pursue phantoms in a darkness
deeper than death?Immoralities of the Bible

The believers in the Bible are loud in their denunciation of what they
are pleased to call the immoral literature of the world; and yet few
books have been published containing more moral filth than this inspired
word of God.These stories are not redeemed by a single flash of wit or
humor.They never rise above the dull details of stupid vice.For one,
I cannot afford to soil my pages with extracts from them; and all such
portions of the Scriptures I leave to be examined, written upon, and
explained by the clergy.Clergymen may know some way by which they can
extract honey from these flowers.Until these passages are expunged from
the Old Testament, it is not a fit book to be read by either old or
young.It contains pages that no minister in the United States would
read to his congregation for any reward whatever.There are chapters
that no gentleman would read in the presence of a lady.There are
chapters that no father would read to his child.There are narratives
utterly unfit to be told; and the time will come when mankind will
wonder that such a book was ever called inspired.The Bible Stands in the Way

But as long as the Bible is considered as the work of God, it will be
hard to make all men too good and pure to imitate it; and as long as it
is imitated there will be vile and filthy books.The literature of
our country will not be sweet and clean until the Bible ceases to be
regarded as the production of a god.The Bible False

In the days of Thomas Paine the Church believed and taught that every
word in the Bible was absolutely true.Since his day it has been proven
false in its cosmogony, false in its astronomy, false in its chronology,
false in its history, and so far as the Old Testament is concerned,
false in almost everything.There are but few, if any, scientific men
who apprehend that the Bible is literally true.Who on earth at this
day would pretend to settle any scientific question by a text from
the Bible?The old belief is confined to the ignorant and zealous.The Church itself will before long be driven to occupy the position of
Thomas Paine.The Man I Love

I love any man who gave me, or helped to give me, the liberty I enjoy
to-night.I love every man who helped put our flag in heaven.I love
every man who has lifted his voice in all the ages for liberty, for a
chainless body, and a fetterless brain.I love every man who has given
to every other human being every right that he claimed for himself.I
love every man who thought more of principle than he did of position.I
love the men who have trampled crowns beneath their feet that they might
do something for mankind.Whale, Jonah and All

The best minds of the orthodox world, to-day, are endeavoring to prove
the existence of a personal Deity.You are no longer asked to swallow the Bible whole, whale,
Jonah and all; you are simply required to believe in God, and pay your
pew-rent.There is not now an enlightened minister in the world who will
seriously contend that Samson's strength was in his hair, or that the
necromancers of Egypt could turn water into blood, and pieces of wood
into serpents.Damned for Laughing at Samson

For my part, I would infinitely prefer to know all the results of
scientific investigation, than to be inspired as Moses was.Supposing
the Bible to be true; why is it any worse or more wicked for free
thinkers to deny it, than for priests to deny the doctrine of Evolution,
or the dynamic theory of heat?Why should we be damned for laughing at
Samson and his foxes, while others, holding the Nebular Hypothesis in
utter contempt, go straight to heaven?The Man, Not the Book, Inspired

Now when I come to a book, for instance I read the writings of
Shakespeare--Shakespeare, the greatest human being who ever existed upon
this globe.All that I have sense enough to
understand.Let another read him who knows
nothing of the drama, who knows nothing of the impersonation of passion;
what does he get from him?In other words, every man gets
from a book, a flower, a star, or the sea, what he is able to get from
his intellectual development and experience.Do you then believe that
the Bible is a different book to every human being that receives it?Can God, then, through the Bible, make the same revelation to two
men?Because the man who reads is the man who inspires.Inspiration is in the man and not in the book.The Bible a Chain

The real oppressor, enslaver and corrupter of the people is the Bible.That book is the chain that binds, the dungeon that holds the clergy.That book spreads the pall of superstition over the colleges and
schools.That book puts out the eyes of science, and makes honest
investigation a crime.That book unmans the politician and degrades the
people.That book fills the world with bigotry, hypocrisy and fear.Absurd and Foolish Fables

Volumes might be written upon the infinite absurdity of this most
incredible, wicked and foolish of all the fables contained in that
repository of the impossible, called the Bible.To me it is a matter
of amazement, that it ever was for a moment believed by any intelligent
human being.The Bible the Work of Man

Is it not infinitely more reasonable to say that this book is the work
of man, that it is filled with mingled truth and error, with mistakes
and facts, and reflects, too faithfully perhaps, the "very form and
pressure of its time?"If there are mistakes in the Bible, certainly
they were made by man.If there is anything contrary to nature, it
was written by man.If there is anything immoral, cruel, heartless
or infamous, it certainly was never written by a being worthy of the
adoration of mankind.Something to Admire, not Laugh at

It strikes me that God might write a book that would not necessarily
excite the laughter of his children.In fact, I think it would be
safe to say that a real God could produce a work that would excite the
admiration of mankind.An Intellectual Deformity

The man who now regards the Old Testament as, in any sense, a sacred or
inspired book, is, in my judgment, an intellectual and moral deformity.There is in it so much that is cruel, ignorant, and ferocious, that it
is to me a matter of amazement that it was ever thought to be the work
of a most merciful Deity.The Bible a Poor Product

Admitting that the Bible is the Book of God, is that his only good job?Will not a man be damned as quick for denying the equator as denying
the Bible?Will he not be damned as quick for denying geology as for
denying the scheme of salvation?When the Bible was first written it was
not believed.Had they known as much about science as we know now, that
Bible would not have been written.The Bible the Battle Ground of Sects

Every sect is a certificate that God has not plainly revealed his will
to man.To each reader the Bible conveys a different meaning.About the
meaning of this book, called a revelation, there have been ages of war,
and centuries of sword and flame.If written by an infinite God, he must
have known that these results must follow; and thus knowing, he must be
responsible for all.The Bible Childish

Paine thought the barbarities of the Old Testament inconsistent with
what he deemed the real character of God.He believed that murder,
massacre and indiscriminate slaughter had never been commanded by
the Deity.He regarded much of the Bible as childish, unimportant
and foolish.Paine
attacked the Bible precisely in the same spirit in which he had attacked
the pretensions of kings.All the pomp in the
world could not make him cower.His reason knew no "Holy of Holies,"
except the abode of Truth.Where Moses got the Pentateuch

Nothing can be clearer than that Moses received from the Egyptians the
principal parts of his narrative, making such changes and additions as
were necessary to satisfy the peculiar superstitions of his own people.God's Letter to His Children

According to the theologians, God, the Father of us all, wrote a letter
to his children.The children have always differed somewhat as to the
meaning of this letter.In consequence of these honest differences,
these brothers began to cut out each other's hearts.In every land,
where this letter from God has been read, the children to whom and for
whom it was written have been filled with hatred and malice.They have
imprisoned and murdered each other, and the wives and children of each
other.In the name of God every possible crime has been committed, every
conceivable outrage has been perpetrated.Brave men, tender and loving
women, beautiful girls, and prattling babes have been exterminated in
the name of Jesus Christ.Examination a Crime

The Church has burned honesty and rewarded hypocrisy.And all this,
because it was commanded by a book--a book that men had been taught
implicitly to believe, long before they knew one word that was in it.They had been taught that to doubt the truth of this book--to examine
it, even--was a crime of such enormity that it could not be forgiven,
either in this world or in the next.All that is necessary, as it seems to me, to convince any reasonable
person that the Bible is simply and purely of human invention--of
barbarian invention--is to read it.Read it as you would any other book;
think of it as you would any other; get the bandage of reverence from
your eyes; drive from your heart the phantom of fear; push from the
throne of your brain the cowled form of superstition--then read the Holy
Bible, and you will be amazed that you ever, for one moment, supposed a
being of infinite wisdom, goodness and purity, to be the author of such
ignorance and such atrocity.An Infallible Book Makes Slaves

Whether the Bible is false or true, is of no consequence in comparison
with the mental freedom of the race.Salvation from slavery is inestimable.As long as man
believes the Bible to be infallible, that book is his master.The
civilization of this century is not the child of faith, but of
unbelief--the result of free thought.Can a Sane Man Believe in Inspiration?What man who ever thinks, can believe that blood can appease God?And
yet our entire system of religion is based on that belief.The Jews
pacified Jehovah with the blood of animals, and according to the
Christian system, the blood of Jesus softened the heart of God a little,
and rendered possible the salvation of a fortunate few.It is hard to
conceive how any sane man can read the Bible and still believe in the
doctrine of inspiration.An Inspiration Test

The Bible was originally written in the Hebrew language, and the Hebrew
language at that time had no vowels in writing.It was written entirely
with consonants, and without being divided into chapters and verses, and
there was no system of punctuation whatever.After you go home to-night
write an English sentence or two with only consonants close together,
and you will find that it will take twice as much inspiration to read it
as it did to write it.The Real Bible

The real Bible is not the work of inspired men, nor prophets, nor
evangelists, nor of Christs.The real Bible has not yet been written,
but is being written.Every man who finds a fact adds a word to this
great book.The Bad Passages in the Bible not Inspired

The bad passages in the Bible are not inspired.No God ever upheld
human slavery, polygamy or a war of extermination.No God ever ordered
a soldier to sheathe his sword in the breast of a mother.No God ever
ordered a warrior to butcher a smiling, prattling babe.No God ever said, be subject to the powers that be.No
God ever endeavored to make man a slave and woman a beast of burden.There are thousands of good passages in the Bible.There are in it wise laws, good customs, some lofty and splendid things.And I do not care whether they are inspired or not, so they are true.But what I do insist upon is that the bad is not inspired.Too much Pictorial

There is no hope for you.It is just as bad to deny hell as it is to
deny heaven.The Garden of Eden is pictorial; a pictorial snake and
a pictorial woman, I suppose, and a pictorial man, and may be it was a
pictorial sin.One Plow worth a Million Sermons

Man must learn to rely upon himself.Reading Bibles will not protect
him from the blasts of winter, but houses, fire and clothing will.To
prevent famine one plow is worth a million sermons, and even patent
medicines will cure more diseases than all the prayers uttered since the
beginning of the world.The Infidels of 1776

By the efforts of these infidels--Paine, Jefferson and Franklin--the
name of God was left out of the Constitution of the United States.They
knew that if an infinite being was put in, no room would be left for the
people.They knew that if any church was made the mistress of the state,
that mistress, like all others, would corrupt, weaken, and destroy.Washington wished a church, established by law, in Virginia.He was
prevented by Thomas Jefferson.It was only a little while ago that
people were compelled to attend church by law in the Eastern States,
and taxes were raised for the support of churches the same as for the
construction of highways and bridges.The great principle enunciated
in the Constitution has silently repealed most of these laws.In the
presence of this great instrument the constitutions of the States grew
small and mean, and in a few years every law that puts a chain upon the
mind, except in Delaware, will be repealed, and for these our children
may thank the infidels of 1776.The Legitimate Influence of Religion

Religion should have the influence upon mankind that its goodness, that
its morality, its justice, its charity, its reason and its argument give
it, and no more.Religion should have the effect upon mankind that it
necessarily has, and no more.Infidels the Flowers of the World

The infidels have been the brave and thoughtful men; the flower of all
the world; the pioneers and heralds of the blessed day of liberty and
love; the generous spirits of the unworthy past; the seers and
prophets of our race; the great chivalric souls, proud victors on the
battle-fields of thought, the creditors of all the years to be.The Noblest Sons of, Earth

Who at the present day can imagine the courage, the devotion to
principle, the intellectual and moral grandeur it once required to be an
infidel, to brave the Church, her racks, her fagots, her dungeons, her
tongues of fire--to defy and scorn her heaven and her hell--her devil
and her God?They were the noblest sons of earth.They were the real
saviors of our race, the destroyers of superstition, and the creators
of Science.They were the real Titans who bared their grand foreheads to
all the thunderbolts of all the gods.How Ingersoll became an Infidel

I may say right here that the Christian idea that any God can make me
His friend by killing mine is about as great a mistake as could be made.They seem to have the idea that just as soon as God kills all the people
that a person loves, he will then begin to love the Lord.What drew
my attention first to these questions was the doctrine of eternal
punishment.This was so abhorrent to my mind that I began to hate the
book in which it was taught.Then, in reading law, going back to find
the origin of laws, I found one had to go but a little way before the
legislator and priest united.This led me to study a good many of the
religions of the world.At first I was greatly astonished to find most
of them better than ours.I then studied our own system to the best of
my ability, and found that people were palming off upon children
and upon one another as the inspired words of God a book that upheld
slavery, polygamy, and almost every other crime.Whether I am right or
wrong, I became convinced that the Bible is not an inspired book, and
then the only question for me to settle was as to whether I should say
what I believed or not.This realty was not the question in my mind,
because, before even thinking of such a question, I expressed my belief,
and I simply claim that right, and expect to exercise it as long as I
live.I may be damned for it in the next world, but it is a great source
of pleasure to me in this.Why should it be taken for granted that the men who devoted their lives
to the liberation of their fellowmen should have been hissed at in
the hour of death by the snakes of conscience, while men who defended
slavery--practiced polygamy--justified the stealing of babes from the
breasts of mothers, and lashed the naked back of unpaid labor, are
supposed to have passed smilingly from earth to the embraces of the
angels?Why should we think that the brave thinkers, the investigators,
the honest men must have left the crumbling shore of time in dread and
fear, while the instigators of the massacre of St.Bartholomew, the
inventors and users of thumb screws, of iron boots and racks, the
burners and tearers of human flesh, the stealers, the whippers, and the
enslavers of men, the buyers and beaters of maidens, mothers, and babes,
the founders of the inquisition, the makers of chains, the builders of
dungeons, the calumniators of the living, the slanderers of the
dead, and even the murderers of Jesus Christ, all died in the odor of
sanctity, with white, forgiven hands folded upon the breasts of peace,
while the destroyers of prejudice, the breakers of fetters, the creators
of light, died surrounded by the fierce fiends of God?Infidelity is Liberty

Infidelity is liberty; all religion is slavery.In every creed man is
the slave of God--woman is the slave of man and the sweet children are
the slaves of all.We do not want creeds; we want knowledge--we want
happiness.The World in Debt to Infidels

What would the world be if infidels had never been?Did all the priests of Rome increase the mental wealth of man as much
as Bruno?Did all the priests of France do as great a work for the
civilization of the world as Diderot and Voltaire?Did all the ministers
of Scotland add as much to the sum of human knowledge as David Hume?Have all the clergymen, monks, friars, ministers, priests, bishops,
cardinals, and popes, from the day of Pentecost to the last election,
done as much for human liberty as Thomas Paine?Infidels the Pioneers of Progress

The history of intellectual progress is written in the lives of
infidels.Political rights have been preserved by traitors--the liberty
of the mind by heretics.To attack the king was treason--to dispute the
priest was blasphemy.The throne and the altar were twins--vultures from the same
egg.It was James I. who said: "No bishop, no king."He might have said:
"No cross, no crown."The king owned the bodies, and the priest the
souls, of men.One lived on taxes, the other on alms.One was a robber,
the other a beggar.The king made laws, the priest made creeds.With bowed backs the people
received the burdens of the one, and, with wonder's open mouth, the
dogmas of the other.If any aspired to be free, they were slaughtered by
the king, and every priest was a Herod who slaughtered the children
of the brain.The king ruled by force, the priest by fear, and both by
both.The king said to the people: "God made you peasants, and He made
me king.He made rags and hovels for you, robes and palaces for me.And the priest said: "God made you ignorant and
vile.If you do not obey me, God will punish
you here and torment you hereafter.Infidels the Great Discoverers

Infidels are the intellectual discoverers.They sail the unknown seas,
and in the realms of thought they touch the shores of other worlds.An
infidel is the finder of a new fact--one who in the mental sky has seen
another star.He is an intellectual capitalist, and for that reason
excites the envy of theological paupers.The Altar of Reason

Virtue is a subordination, of the passions to the intellect.It is to
act in accordance with your highest convictions.It does not consist in
believing, but in doing.This is the sublime truth that the Infidels in
all ages have uttered.They have handed the torch from one to the other
through all the years that have fled.Upon the altar of reason they have
kept the sacred fire, and through the long midnight of faith they fed
the divine flame.GODS AND DEVILS




275.Every Nation has Created a God

Each nation has created a God, and the God has always resembled his
creators.He hated and loved what they hated and loved.Each God was
intensely patriotic, and detested all nations but his own.All these
gods demanded praise, flattery and worship.Most of them were pleased
with sacrifice, and the smell of innocent blood has ever been considered
a divine perfume.All these gods have insisted on having a vast number
of priests, and the priests have always insisted upon being supported
by the people; and the principle business of these priests has been
to boast that their God could easily vanquish all the other gods put
together.Gods with Back-Hair

Man, having always been the physical superior of woman, accounts for
the fact that most of the high gods have been males.Had women been the
physical superior; the powers supposed to be the rulers of Nature would
have been woman, and instead of being represented in the apparel of man,
they would have luxuriated in trains, low-necked dresses, laces and
back-hair.Creation the Decomposition of the Infinite

Admitting that a god did create the universe, the question then arises,
of what did he create it?Nothing,
considered in the light of a raw material, is a most decided failure.It
follows, then, that the god must have made the universe out of himself,
he being the only existence.The universe is material, and if it was
made of god, the god must have been material.With this very thought in
his mind, Anaximander of Miletus, said: "Creation is the decomposition
of the infinite."The Gods Are as the People Are

No god was ever in advance of the nation that created him.The <DW64>s
represented their deities with black skins and curly hair: The Mongolian
gave to his a yellow complexion and dark almond-shaped eyes.The Jews
were not allowed to paint theirs, or we should have seen Jehovah with
a full beard, an oval face, and an aquiline nose.Zeus was a perfect
Greek, and Jove looked as though a member of the Roman senate.The gods
of Egypt had the patient face and placid look of the loving people who
made them.The gods of northern countries were represented warmly clad
in robes of fur; those of the tropics were naked.The gods of India
were often mounted upon elephants; those of some islanders were great
swimmers, and the deities of the Arctic zone were passionately fond of
whale's blubber.Gods Shouldn't Make Mistakes

Generally the devotee has modeled them after himself, and has given them
hands, heads, feet, eyes, ears, and organs of speech.Each nation made
its gods and devils not only speak its language, but put in their mouths
the same mistakes in history, geography, astronomy, and in all matters
of fact, generally made by the people.Miracles

No one, in the world's whole history, ever attempted to substantiate a
truth by a miracle.Nothing but
falsehood ever attested itself by signs and wonders.No miracle ever was
performed, and no sane man ever thought he had performed one, and until
one is performed, there can be no evidence of the existence of any power
superior to, and independent of nature.Plenty of Gods on Hand

Man has never been at a loss for gods.He has worshipped almost
everything, including the vilest and most disgusting beasts.He has
worshipped fire, earth, air, water, light, stars, and for hundreds, of
ages prostrated himself before enormous snakes.Savage tribes often make
gods of articles they get from civilized people.The Todas worship
a cowbell.The Kodas worship two silver plates, which they regard as
husband and wife, and another tribe manufactured a god out of a king of
hearts.The Devil Difficulty

In the olden times the existence of devils was universally admitted.The
people had no doubt upon that subject, and from such belief it followed
as a matter of course, that a person, in order to vanquish these devils,
had either to be a god, or to be assisted by one.All founders of
religions have established their claims to divine origin by controlling
evil spirits, and suspending the laws of nature.Casting out devils was
a certificate of divinity.A prophet, unable to cope with the powers of
darkness, was regarded with contempt.The utterance of the highest and
noblest sentiments, the most blameless and holy life, commanded but
little respect, unless accompanied by power to work miracles and command
spirits.If he was God, of course
the devil knew that fact, and yet, according to this account, the devil
took the omnipotent God and placed him upon a pinnacle of the temple,
and endeavored to induce him, to dash himself against the earth.Failing
in that, he took the creator, owner and governor of the universe up into
an exceeding high mountain, and offered him this world--this grain of
sand--if he, the God of all the worlds, would fall down and worship
him, a poor devil, without even a tax title to one foot of dirt!Is it
possible the devil was such an idiot?Should any great credit be given
to this deity for not being caught with such chaff?The
devil--the prince of sharpers--the king of cunning--the master of
finesse, trying to bribe God with a grain of sand that belonged to God!Industrious Deities

Few nations have been so poor as to have but one god.Gods were made
so easily, and the raw material cost so little, that generally the god
market was fairly glutted, and heaven crammed with these phantoms.These
gods not only attended to the skies, but were supposed to interfere in
all the affairs of men.All was supposed to be under their
immediate control.Nothing was too small--nothing too large; the falling
of sparrows and the motions of the planets were alike attended to by
these industrious and observing deities.God in Idleness

If a god created the universe, then, there must have been a time when he
commenced to create.Back of that time there must have been an eternity,
during which there had existed nothing--absolutely nothing--except this
supposed god.According to this theory, this god spent an eternity, so
to speak, in an infinite vacuum, and in perfect idleness.Fancy a Devil Drowning a World

One of these gods, according to the account, drowned an entire world,
with the exception of eight persons.The old, the young, the beautiful
and the helpless were remorselessly devoured by the shoreless sea.This,
the most fearful tragedy that the imagination of ignorant priests ever
conceived, was the act, not of a devil, but of a god, so-called, whom
men ignorantly worship unto this day.What a stain such an act would
leave upon the character of a devil!Some Gods Very Particular About Little Things

From their starry thrones they frequently came to the earth for the
purpose of imparting information to man.It is related of one that he
came amid thunderings and lightnings in order to tell the people that
they should not cook a kid in its mother's milk.Some left their shining
abodes to tell women that they should, or should not, have children, to
inform a priest how to cut and wear his apron, and to give directions as
to the proper manner of cleaning the intestines of a bird.288 The Gods of To-day the Scorn of To-morrow

Nations, like individuals, have their periods of youth, of manhood and
decay.The same inexorable destiny awaits them
all.The gods created by the nations must perish with their creators.They were created by men, and like men, they must pass away.The deities
of one age are the by-words of the next.No Evidence of a God in Nature

The best minds, even in the religious world, admit that in the material
nature there is no evidence of what they are pleased to call a god.They find their evidence in the phenomena of intelligence, and very
innocently assert that intelligence is above, and in fact, opposed to
nature.They insist that man, at least, is a special creation; that
he has somewhere in his brain a divine spark, a little portion of the
"Great First Cause."They say that matter cannot produce thought; but
that thought can produce matter.They tell us that man has intelligence,
and therefore there must be an intelligence greater than his.Why not
say, God has intelligence, therefore there must be an intelligence
greater than his?So far as we know, there is no intelligence apart
from matter.We cannot conceive of thought, except as produced within a
brain.Great Variety in Gods

Gods have been manufactured after numberless models., and according to
the most grotesque fashions.Some have a thousand arms, some a hundred
heads, some are adorned with necklaces of living snakes, some are armed
with clubs, some with sword and shield, some with bucklers, and some
have wings as a cherub; some were invisible, some would show themselves
entire, and some would only show their backs; some were jealous, some
were foolish, some turned themselves into men, some into swans, some
into bulls, some into doves, and some into Holy-Ghosts, and made love
to the beautiful daughters of men: Some were married--all ought to have
been--and some were considered as old bachelors from all eternity.Some
had children, and the children were turned into gods and worshiped as
their fathers had been.Most of these gods were revengeful, savage,
lustful, and ignorant.As they generally depended upon their priests for
information, their ignorance can hardly excite our astonishment.God Grows Smaller

"But," says the religionist, "you cannot explain everything; and that
which you cannot explain, that which you do not comprehend, is my God."We are understanding more every day;
consequently your God is growing smaller every day.Give the Devil His Due

If the account given in Genesis is really true, ought we not, after all,
to thank this serpent?He was the first schoolmaster, the first advocate
of learning, the first enemy of ignorance, the first to whisper in human
ears the sacred word liberty, the creator of ambition, the author of
modesty, of inquiry, of doubt, of investigation, of progress and of
civilization.Casting out Devils

Even Christ, the supposed son of God, taught that persons were possessed
of evil spirits, and frequently, according to the account, gave proof of
his divine origin and mission by frightening droves of devils out of his
unfortunate countrymen.Casting out devils was his principal employment,
and the devils thus banished generally took occasion to acknowledge him
as the true Messiah; which was not only very kind of them, but quite
fortunate for him.On the Horns of a Dilemma

The history of religion is simply the story of man's efforts in all ages
to avoid one of two great powers, and to pacify the other.Both powers
have inspired little else than abject fear.The cold, calculating sneer
of the devil, and the frown of God, were equally terrible.In any event,
man's fate was to be arbitrarily fixed forever by an unknown power
superior to all law, and to all fact.The Devil and the Swine

How are you going to prove a miracle?How would you go to work to prove
that the devil entered into a drove of swine?Who saw it, and who would
know a devil if he did see him?Some tell me that it is the desire of God that I should worship Him?If he is in want and I can assist Him and will
not, I would be an ingrate and an infamous wretch.But I am satisfied
that I cannot by any possibility assist the infinite.I can help feed the hungry, clothe the naked, enlighten
ignorance.I can help at least, in some degree, toward covering this
world with a mantle of joy I may be wrong, but I do not believe that
there is any being in this universe who gives rain for praise, who gives
sunshine for prayer, or who blesses a man simply because he kneels.If the infinite "Father" allows a majority of his children to live in
ignorance and wretchedness now, what evidence is there that he will ever
improve their condition?Can the conduct
of infinite wisdom, power and love ever change?Is the infinite capable
of any improvement whatever?According to the theologians, God prepared this globe expressly for the
habitation of his loved children, and yet he filled the forests with
ferocious beasts; placed serpents in every path; stuffed the world
with earthquakes, and adorned its surface with mountains of flame.Notwithstanding all this, we are told that the world is perfect; that
it was created by a perfect being, and is therefore necessarily perfect.The next moment, these same persons will tell us that the world was
cursed; covered with brambles, thistles and thorns, and that man was
doomed to disease and death, simply because our poor, dear mother ate an
apple contrary to the command of an arbitrary God.The Devils better than the Gods

Our ancestors not only had their God-factories, but they made devils
as well.These devils were generally disgraced and fallen gods.These
devils generally sympathized with man.In nearly all the theologies,
mythologies and religions, the devils have been much more humane and
merciful than the gods.No devil ever gave one of his generals an order
to kill children and to rip open the bodies of pregnant women.Such
barbarities were always ordered by the good gods!The pestilences were
sent by the most merciful gods!The frightful famine, during which the
dying child with pallid lips sucked the withered bosom of a dead
mother, was sent by the loving gods.No devil was ever charged with such
fiendish brutality.Is it possible that an infinite God created this world simply to be the
dwelling-place of slaves and serfs?simply for the purpose of raising
orthodox Christians?That he did a few miracles to astonish them; that
all the evils of life are simply his punishments, and that he is finally
going to turn heaven into a kind of religious museum filled with Baptist
barnacles, petrified Presbyterians and Methodist mummies?I want no
heaven for which I must give my reason; no happiness in exchange for
my liberty, and no immortality that demands the surrender of my
individuality.Better rot in the windowless tomb, to which there is no
door but the red mouth of the pallid worm, than wear the jeweled collar
even of a god.It is impossible to conceive of a more thoroughly despicable, hateful,
and arrogant being, than the Jewish god.In the mythology of the world he has no parallel.He, only, is
never touched by agony and tears.He cares neither for love nor music,
beauty nor joy.A false friend, an unjust judge, a braggart, hypocrite,
and tyrant.Compared with Jehovah, Pharaoh was a benefactor, and the
tyranny of Egypt was freedom to those who suffered the liberty of God.HEAVEN AND HELL




302.Hope of a Future Life

For my part I know nothing of any other state of existence, either
before or after this, and I have never become personally acquainted with
anybody who did.There may be another life, and if there is the best
way to prepare for it is by making somebody happy in this.God certainly
cannot afford to put a man in hell who has made a little heaven in this
world.I would like to see how things come
out in this world when I am dead.There are some people I should like to
see again, but if there is no other life I shall never know it.I am Immortal

So far as I am concerned I am immortal; that is to say, I can't
recollect when I did not exist, and there never will be a time when I
will remember that I do not exist.I would like to have several millions
of dollars, and I may say I have a lively hope that some day I may be
rich; but to tell you the truth I have very little evidence of it.Our
hope of immortality does not come from any religions, but nearly all
religions come from that hope.The Old Testament, instead of telling
us that we are immortal, tells us how we lost immortality.You will
recollect that if Adam and Eve could have gotten to the tree of life,
they would have eaten of its fruit and would have lived forever; but for
the purpose of preventing immortality God turned them out of the Garden
of Eden, and put certain angels with swords or sabres at the gate to
keep them from getting back.The Old Testament proves, if it proves
anything, which I do not think it does, that there is no life after
this; and the New Testament is not very specific on the subject.There
were a great many opportunities for the Savior and his apostles to
tell us about another world, but they didn't improve them to any great
extent; and the only evidence so far as I know about another life is,
first, that we have no evidence; and, secondly, that we are rather sorry
that we have not, and wish we had.And suppose, after all, that death does end all.Next to eternal joy,
next to being forever with those we love and those who have loved us,
next to that is to be wrapped in the dreamless drapery of eternal peace.Upon the shadowy shore of death
the sea of trouble casts no wave.Eyes that have been curtained by the
everlasting dark will never know again the touch of tears.Lips that
have been touched by the eternal silence will never utter another word
of grief.And I had
rather think of those I have loved, and those I have lost, as having
returned to earth, as having become a part of the elemental wealth of
the the world.I would rather think of them as unconscious dust.I would
rather think of them as gurgling in the stream, floating in the cloud,
bursting into light upon the shores of worlds.I would rather think
of them thus than to have even a suspicion that their souls had been
clutched by an orthodox God.The Old World Ignorant of Destiny

Moses differed from most of the makers of sacred books by his failure
to say anything of a future life, by failing to promise heaven, and to
threaten hell.Upon the subject of a future state, there is not one
word in the Pentateuch.Probably at that early day God did not deem
it important to make a revelation as to the eternal destiny of man.He seems to have thought that he could control the Jews, at least, by
rewards and punishments in this world, and so he kept the frightful
realities of eternal joy and torment a profound secret from the people
of his choice.He thought it far more important to tell the Jews their
origin than to enlighten them as to their destiny.Where the Doctrine of Hell was born

I honestly believe that the doctrine of hell was born in the glittering
eyes of snakes that run in frightful coils watching for their prey.I
believe it was born in the yelping and howling and growling and snarling
of wild beasts.I believe it was born in the grin of hyenas and in the
malicious clatter of depraved apes.I despise it, I defy it, and I hate
it; and when the great ship freighted with the world goes down in
the night of death, chaos and disaster, I will not be guilty of the
ineffable meanness of pushing from my breast my wife and children and
paddling off in some orthodox canoe.I will go down with those I love
and with those who love me.I will go down with the ship and with my
race.Nothing can make me believe that there is any being that is going to
burn and torment and damn his children forever.The Grand Companionships of Hell

Since hanging has got to be a means of grace, I would prefer hell.I had
a thousand times rather associate with the pagan philosophers than with
the inquisitors of the middle ages.I certainly should prefer the worst
man in Greek or Roman history to John Calvin, and I can imagine no man
in the world that I would not rather sit on the same bench with than the
puritan fathers and the founders of orthodox churches.I would trade off
my harp any minute for a seat in the other country.All the poets will
be in perdition, and the greatest thinkers, and, I should think, most
of the women whose society would tend to increase the happiness of
man, nearly all the painters, nearly all the sculptors, nearly all
the writers of plays, nearly all the great actors, most of the best
musicians, and nearly all the good fellows--the persons who know good
stories, who can sing songs, or who will loan a friend a dollar.They will mostly all be in that country, and if I did not live there
permanently, I certainly would want it so I could spend my winter months
there.Let me put one case and I will be through with this branch of the
subject.The husband is a good
fellow and the wife a splendid woman.They live and love each other and
all at once he is taken sick, and they watch day after day and night
after night around his bedside until their property is wasted and
finally she has to go to work, and she works through eyes blinded with
tears, and the sentinel of love watches at the bedside of her prince,
and at the least breath or the least motion she is awake; and she
attends him night after night and day after day for years, and finally
he dies, and she has him in her arms and covers his wasted face with the
tears of agony and love.He dies, and
she buries him and puts flowers above his grave, and she goes there in
the twilight of evening and she takes her children, and tells her little
boys and girls through her tears how brave and how true and how tender
their father was, and finally she dies and goes to hell, because she was
not a believer; and he goes to the battlements of heaven and looks over
and sees the woman who loved him with all the wealth of her love, and
whose tears made his dead face holy and sacred, and he looks upon her
in the agonies of hell without having his happiness diminished in the
least.With all due respect to everybody I say, damn any such doctrine
as that.The Drama of Damnation

When you come to die, as you look back upon the record of your life, no
matter how many men you have wrecked and ruined, and no matter how many
women you have deceived and deserted--all that may be forgiven you;
but if you recollect that you have laughed at God's book you will see
through the shadows of death, the leering looks of fiends and the forked
tongues of devils.For instance, it
is the day of judgment.When the man is called up by the recording
secretary, or whoever does the cross-examining, he says to his soul:
"Where are you from?""Well, I don't like to talk about myself.""Well, I was a good fellow; I loved
my wife; I loved my children.My home was my heaven; my fireside was my
paradise, and to sit there and see the lights and shadows falling on the
faces of those I love, that to me was a perpetual joy.I never gave one
of them a solitary moment of pain.I don't owe a dollar in the world,
and I left enough to pay my funeral expenses and keep the wolf of want
from the door of the house I loved.That is the kind of a man I am."They were always expecting to be happy simply because somebody else was
to be damned.""Well, did you believe that rib story?"To tell you the
God's truth, that was a little more than I could swallow.""Yes, sir, and to the Young Men's Christian
Association.""Did you
ever run off with any of the money?""I don't like to tell, sir.""What kind of a bank did you have?""How much did you
run off with?""Did you take anything
else along with you?""Did you have a wife and children of your own?""Oh, yes; but such was my confidence in God that I
believed he would take care of them."I believed all of it, sir; I often used to be sorry that there were
not harder stories yet in the Bible, so that I could show what my faith
could do."Annihilation rather than be a God

No God has a right to make a man he intends to drown.Eternal wisdom has
no right to make a poor investment, no right to engage in a speculation
that will not finally pay a dividend.No God has a right to make
a failure, and surely a man who is to be damned forever is not a
conspicuous success.Yet upon love's breast, the Church has placed that
asp; around the child of immortality the Church has coiled the worm that
never dies.For my part I want no heaven, if there is to be a hell.I
would rather be annihilated than be a god and know that one human soul
would have to suffer eternal agony."All that have Red Hair shall be Damned."I admit that most Christians are honest--always have admitted it.I
admit that most ministers are honest, and that they are doing the best
they can in their way for the good of mankind; but their doctrines are
hurtful; they do harm in the world; and I am going to do what I can
against their doctrines.They preach this infamy: "He that believes
shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned."Every word
of that text has been an instrument of torture; every letter in that
text has been a sword thrust into the bleeding and quivering heart of
man; every letter has been a dungeon; every line has been a chain; and
that infamous sentence has covered this world with blood.I deny that
"whoso believes shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be
damned."No man can control his belief; you might as well say, "All that
have red hair shall be damned."The Conscience of a Hyena

But, after all, what I really want to do is to destroy the idea of
eternal punishment.That
doctrine fills hell with honest men, and heaven with intellectual and
moral paupers.That doctrine allows people to sin on a credit.That
doctrine allows the basest to be eternally happy and the most honorable
to suffer eternal pain.I think of all doctrines it is the most
infinitely infamous, and would disgrace the lowest savage, and any man
who believes it, and has imagination enough to understand it, has the
heart of a serpent and the conscience of a hyena.I Leave the Dead

But for me I leave the dead where nature leaves them, and whatever
flower of hope springs up in my heart I will cherish.But I cannot
believe that there is any being in this universe who has created a
soul for eternal pain, and I would rather that every God would destroy
himself, I would rather that we all should go back to the eternal chaos,
to the black and starless night, than that just one soul should suffer
eternal agony.Swedenborg did one thing for which I feel almost grateful.He gave an
account of having met John Calvin in hell.Nothing connected with the
supernatural could be more natural than this.The only thing detracting
from the value of this report is, that if there is a hell, we know
without visiting the place that John Calvin must be there.GOVERNING GREAT MEN




315.Jesus Christ

And let me say here once for all, that for the man Christ I have
infinite respect.Let me say once for all that the place where man has
died for man is holy ground.Let me say once for all, to that great and
serene man I gladly pay--I _gladly_ pay the tribute of my admiration and
my tears.He was an infidel in his
time.He was regarded as a blasphemer, and his life was destroyed by
hypocrites who have in all ages done what they could to trample freedom
out of the human mind.Had I lived at that time I would have been his
friend.And should he come again he will not find a better friend than
I will be.For the theological creation I have
a different feeling.If he was in fact God, he knew there was no such
thing as death; he knew that what we call death was but the eternal
opening of the golden gates of everlasting joy.And it took no heroism
to face a death that was simply eternal life.The Emperor Constantine, who lifted Christianity into power, murdered
his wife Fausta and his eldest son Crispus the same year that he
convened the council of Nice to decide whether Jesus Christ was a man or
the son of God.The council decided that Christ was substantial with
the Father.We are thus indebted to a wife
murderer for settling the vexed question of the divinity of the Savior.Theodosius called a council at Constantinople in 381, and this council
decided that the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father.Theodosius,
the younger, assembled another council at Ephesus to ascertain who the
Virgin Mary really was, and it was solemnly decided in the year 431 that
she was the mother of God.In 451 it was decided by a council held at
Chalcedon, called together by the Emperor Marcian, that Christ had two
natures--the human and divine.In 680, in another general council, held
at Constantinople, convened by order of Pognatius, it was also decided
that Christ had two wills, and in the year 1274 it was decided at the
council of Lyons that the Holy Ghost proceeded not only from the Father,
but from the Son as well.Had it not been for these councils we might
have been without a trinity even unto this day.When we take into
consideration the fact that a belief in the trinity is absolutely
essential to salvation, how unfortunate it was for the world that this
doctrine was not established until the year 1274.Think of the millions
that dropped into hell while these questions were being discussed.The church never has pretended that Jefferson or Franklin died in fear.Franklin wrote no books against the fables of the ancient Jews.He
thought it useless to cast the pearls of thought before the swine of
ignorance and fear.He was the father of a
great party.He gave his views in letters and to trusted friends.He
was a Virginian, author of the Declaration of Independence, founder of a
university, father of a political party, President of the United States,
a statesman and philosopher.He was too powerful for the churches of
his day.Paine was a foreigner, a citizen of the world.He had done these things openly, and what
he had said could not be answered.His arguments were so good that his
character was bad.The Emperor, stained with every crime, is supposed to have died like a
Christian.We hear nothing of fiends leering at him in the shadows of
death.He does not see the forms of his murdered wife and son covered
with the blood he shed.From his white and shriveled lips issued no
shrieks of terror.He does not cover his glazed eyes with thin and
trembling hands to shut out the visions of hell.His chamber is filled
with the rustle of wings waiting to bear his soul to the thrilling
realms of joy.Against the Emperor Constantine the church has hurled no
anathema.She has accepted the story of his vision in the clouds, and
his holy memory has been guarded by priest and pope.Diderot

Diderot was born in 1713.His parents were in what may be called the
humbler walks of life.Like Voltaire, he was educated by the Jesuits.He
had in him something of the vagabond, and was for several years almost a
beggar in Paris.He was endeavoring to live by his pen.In that day and
generation a man without a patron, endeavoring to live by literature,
was necessarily almost a beggar.He nearly starved--frequently going
for days without food.Afterward, when he had something himself, he was
generous as the air.No man ever was more willing to give, and no man
less willing to receive, than Diderot.His motto was, "Incredulity
is the first step toward philosophy."He had the vices of most
Christians--was nearly as immoral as the majority of priests.His vices
he shared in common--his virtues were his own--All who knew him united
in saying that he had the pity of a woman, the generosity of a prince,
the self-denial of an anchorite, the courage of Caesar, an insatiate
thirst foi knowledge, and the enthusiasm of a poet.He attacked with
every power of his mind the superstition of his day.He was in favor of universal
education--the church despised it.He wished to put the knowledge of
the whole world within reach of the poorest.He wished to drive from
the gate of the Garden of Eden the cherubim of superstition, so that
the child of Adam might return to eat once more the fruit of the tree
of knowledge.His poor little desk was
ransacked by the police, searching for manuscripts in which something
might be found that would justify the imprisonment of such a dangerous
man.Whoever, in 1750, wished to increase the knowledge of mankind was
regarded as the enemy of social order.Benedict Spinoza

One of the greatest thinkers of the world was Benedict Spinoza--a Jew,
born at Amsterdam in 1638.He asked the rabbis so many questions, and insisted to such a degree on
what he called reason, that his room was preferred to his company.His Jewish brethren excommunicated him from the synagogue.Under the
terrible curse of their religion he was made an outcast from every
Jewish home.His own father could not give him shelter, and his mother,
after the curse had been pronounced, could not give him bread, could not
even speak to him, without becoming an outcast herself.All the cruelty
of Jehovah was in this curse.Spinoza was but twenty-four years old
when he found himself without friends and without kindred.He earned his bread with willing hands, and cheerfully
divided his poor crust with those below.He tried to solve the problem
of existence.According to him the universe did not commence to
be.It is; from eternity it was; and to eternity it will be.He insisted
that God is inside, not outside, of what we call substance.Thomas Paine

Poverty was his mother--Necessity his master.He had more brains than
books; more sense than education; more courage than politeness;
more strength than polish.He had no veneration for old mistakes--no
admiration for ancient lies.He loved the truth for the truth's
sake, and for man's sake.He saw oppression on every hand; injustice
everywhere; hypocrisy at the altar, venality on the bench, tyranny on
the throne; and with a splendid courage he espoused the cause of the
weak against the strong--of the enslaved many against the titled few.The Greatest of all Political Writers

In my judgment, Thomas Paine was the best political writer that ever
lived."What he wrote was pure nature, and his soul and his pen ever
went together."Ceremony, pageantry, and all the paraphernalia of
power, had no effect upon him.He examined into the why and wherefore of
things.He was perfectly radical in his mode of thought.Nothing short
of the bed-rock satisfied him.His enthusiasm for what he believed to
be right knew no bounds.During all the dark scenes of the Revolution,
never for one moment did he despair.Year after year his brave words
were ringing through the land, and by the bivouac fires the weary
soldiers read the inspiring words of "Common Sense," filled with ideas
sharper than their swords, and consecrated themselves anew to the cause
of Freedom.The Writings of Paine

The writings of Paine are gemmed with compact statements that carry
conviction to the dullest.Day and night he labored for America, until
there was a government of the people and for the people.At the close
of the Revolution no one stood higher than Thomas Paine.Had he been
willing to live a hypocrite, he would have been respectable, he at least
could have died surrounded by other hypocrites, and at his death there
would have been an imposing funeral, with miles of carriages, filled
with hypocrites, and above his hypocritical dust there would have been a
hypocritical monument covered with lies.The truth is, he died as he had lived.Some ministers were impolite
enough to visit him against his will.Several of them he ordered
from his room.A couple of Catholic priests, in all the meekness of
hypocrisy, called that they might enjoy the agonies of a dying friend
of man.Thomas Paine, rising in his bed, the few embers of expiring life
blown into flame by the breath of indignation, had the goodness to curse
them both.His physician, who seems to have been a meddling fool, just
as the cold hand of death was touching the patriot's heart, whispered
in the dull ear of the dying man: "Do you believe, or do you wish to
believe, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?"And the reply was: "I
have no wish to believe on that subject."These were the last remembered
words of Thomas Paine.He died as serenely as ever Christian passed
away.He died in the full possession of his mind, and on the very brink
and edge of death proclaimed the doctrines of his life.Paine Believed in God

Thomas Paine was a champion in both hemispheres of human liberty; one of
the founders and fathers of the Republic; one of the foremost men of his
age.He never wrote a word in favor of injustice.He was a despiser of
slavery.He wast in the widest and
best sense, a friend of all his race.His head was as clear as his heart
was good, and he had the courage to speak his honest thought.He was
the first man to write these words: "The United States of America."He furnished every thought
that now glitters in the Declaration of Independence.He believed in one
God and no more.He was a believer even in special providence, and he
hoped for immortality.The Intellectual Hera

Thomas Paine was one of the intellectual heroes--one of the men to whom
we are indebted.His name is associated forever with the Great Republic.As long as free government exists he will be remembered, admired and
honored.He lived a long, laborious and useful life.The world is better
for his having lived.Daniel journeyed to the garden.For the sake of truth he accepted hatred and
reproach for his portion.His friends
were untrue to him because he was true to himself, and true to them.He
lost the respect of what is called society, but kept his own.His life
is what the world calls failure and what history calls success.If to
love your fellow-men more than self is goodness, Thomas Paine was good.If to be in advance of your time--to be a pioneer in the direction of
right--is greatness.If to avow your principles and discharge your
duty in the presence of death is heroic, Thomas Paine was a hero.At the
age of seventy-three, death touched his tired heart.He died in the land
his genius defended--under the flag he gave to the skies.Slander cannot
touch him now--hatred cannot reach him more.He sleeps in the sanctuary
of the tomb, beneath the quiet of the stars.Paine, Franklin, Jefferson

In our country there were three infidels--Paine, Franklin and Jefferson.The colonies were full of superstition, the Puritans with the spirit
of persecution.Laws savage, ignorant, and malignant had been passed in
every colony for the purpose of destroying intellectual liberty.The toleration acts of
Maryland tolerated only Christians--not infidels, not thinkers, not
investigators.The charity of Roger Williams was not extended to those
who denied the Bible, or suspected the divinity of Christ.It was not
based upon the rights of man, but upon the rights of believers, who
differed in non-essential points.David Hume

On the 26th of April, 1711, David Hume was born.David Hume was one of
the few Scotchmen of his day who were not owned by the church.He had
the manliness to examine historical and religious questions for himself,
and the courage to give his conclusions to the world.He was singularly
capable of governing himself.He was a philosopher, and lived a calm
and cheerful life, unstained by an unjust act, free from all excess,
and devoted in a reasonable degree to benefiting his fellow-men.After
examining the Bible he became convinced that it was not true.For
failing to suppress his real opinion, for failing to tell a deliberate
falsehood, he brought upon him the hatred of the church.Voltaire

Voltaire was the intellectual autocrat of his time.From his throne at
the foot of the Alps he pointed the finger of scorn at every hypocrite
in Europe.He left the quiver of ridicule without an arrow.He was the
pioneer of his century.Through the
shadows of faith and fable, through the darkness of myth and miracle,
through the midnight of Christianity, through the blackness of bigotry,
past cathedral and dungeon, past rack and stake, past altar and throne,
he carried, with brave and chivalric hands, the torch of reason.John Calvin

Calvin was of a pallid, bloodless complexion, thin, sickly, irritable,
gloomy, impatient, egotistic, tyrannical, heartless, and infamous.He
was a strange compound of revengeful morality, malicious forgiveness,
ferocious charity, egotistic humility, and a kind of hellish justice.In other words, he was as near like the God of the Old Testament as his
health permitted.Calvin's Five Fetters

This man forged five fetters for the brain.That is to say, predestination, particular redemption, total
depravity, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints.About
the neck of each follower he put a collar bristling with these five iron
points.The presence of all these points on the collar is still the test
of orthodoxy in the church he founded.This man, when in the flush of
youth, was elected to the office of preacher in Geneva.He at once,
in union with Farel, drew up a condensed statement of the Presbyterian
doctrine, and all the citizens of Geneva, on pain of banishment, were
compelled to take an oath that they believed this statement.Of this
proceeding Calvin very innocently remarked that it produced great
satisfaction.A man named Caroli had the audacity to dispute with
Calvin.Humboldt

Humboldt breathed the atmosphere of investigation.Old ideas were
abandoned; old creeds, hallowed by centuries, were thrown aside; thought
became courageous; the athlete, Reason, challenged to mortal combat the
monsters of superstition.Humbolt's Travels

Europe becoming too small for his genius, he visited the tropics.He
sailed along the gigantic Amazon--the mysterious Orinoco--traversed the
Pampas--climbed the Andes until he stood upon the crags of Chimborazo,
more than eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, and climbed
on until blood flowed from his eyes and lips.For nearly five years he
pursued his investigations in the new world, accompanied by the intrepid
Bonplandi.He was the best intellectual
organ of these new revelations of science.He was calm, reflective and
eloquent; filled with a sense of the beautiful, and the love of truth.His collections were immense, and valuable beyond calculation to every
science.He endured innumerable hardships, braved countless dangers in
unknown and savage lands, and exhausted his fortune for the advancement
of true learning.Humboldt's Illustrious Companions

Humboldt was the friend and companion of the greatest poets, historians,
philologists, artists, statesmen, critics, and logicians of his time.He was the companion of Schiller, who believed that man would be
regenerated through the influence of the Beautiful of Goethe, the grand
patriarch of German literature; of Weiland, who has been called
the Voltaire of Germany; of Herder, who wrote the outlines of a
philosophical history of man; of Kotzebue, who lived in the world of
romance; of Schleiermacher, the pantheist; of Schlegel, who gave to
his countrymen the enchanted realm of Shakespeare; of the sublime Kant,
author of the first work published in Germany on Pure Reason; of Fichte,
the infinite idealist; of Schopenhauer, the European Buddhist who
followed the great Gautama to the painless and dreamless Nirwana, and
of hundreds of others, whose names are familiar to and honored by the
scientific world.Humboldt the Apostle of Science

Upon his return to Europe he was hailed as the second Columbus; as the
scientific discover of America; as the revealer of a new world; as the
great demonstrator of the sublime truth, that the universe is governed
by law.I have seen a picture of the old man, sitting upon a mountain
side--above him the eternal snow--below, the smiling valley of the
tropics, filled with vine and palm; his chin upon his breast, his
eyes deep, thoughtful and calm his forehead majestic--grander than the
mountain upon which he sat--crowned with the snow of his whitened hair,
he looked the intellectual autocrat of this world.Not satisfied with
his discoveries in America, he crossed the steppes of Asia, the wastes
of

Siberia, the great Ural range adding to the knowledge of mankind at
every step.H is energy acknowledged no obstacle, his life knew no
leisure; every day was filled with labor and with thought.He was one
of the apostles of science, and he served his divine master with
a self-sacrificing zeal that knew no abatement; with an ardor that
constantly increased, and with a devotion unwavering and constant as the
polar star.Ingersoll Muses by Napoleon's Tomb

A little while ago I stood by the grave of the old Napoleon--a
magnificent tomb of gilt and gold, fit almost for a dead deity--and
gazed upon the sarcophagus of black Egyptian marble, where rest at last
the ashes of the restless man.I leaned over the balustrade and thought
about the career of the greatest soldier of the modern world.I saw him
walking upon the banks of the Seine, contemplating suicide--I saw him
at Toulon--I saw him putting down the mob in the streets of Paris--I saw
him at the head of the army of Italy--I saw him crossing the bridge of
Lodi with the tri-color in his hand--I saw him in Egypt in the shadows
of the pyramids--I saw him conquer the Alps and mingle the eagles of
France with the eagles of the crags.I saw him at Marengo--at Ulm and
Austerlitz.I saw him in Russia, where the infantry of the snow and the
cavalry of the wild blast scattered his legions like Winter's withered
leaves.I saw him at Leipsic in defeat and disaster--driven by a million
bayonets back upon Paris--clutched like a wild beast--banished to Elba.I saw him escape and retake an empire by the force of his genius.I saw
him upon the frightful field of Waterloo, where chance and fate combined
to wreck the fortunes of their former king.Helena,
with his hands crossed behind him, gazing out upon the sad and solemn
sea.I thought of the orphans and widows he had made--of the tears that
had been shed for his glory, and of the only woman who ever loved him,
pushed from his heart by the cold hand of ambition.And I said I would
rather have been a French peasant, and worn wooden shoes.I would rather
have lived in a hut with a vine growing over the door, and the grapes
growing purple in the kisses of the Autumn sun.I would rather have been
that poor peasant with my loving wife by my side, knitting as the day
died out of the sky--with my children upon my knees and their arms about
me; I would rather have been that man and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust, than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder known as Napoleon the Great.And so I
would, ten thousand times.Eulogy on J. G. Blaine

This is a grand year--a year filled with recollections of the
Revolution; filled with the proud and tender memories of the past; with
the sacred legends of liberty; a year in which the sons of freedom will
drink from the fountains of enthusiasm; a year in which the people call
for a man who has preserved in Congress what our soldiers won upon
the field; a year in which they call for the man who has torn from the
throat of treason the tongue of slander--for the man who has snatched
the mask of Democracy from the hideous face of rebellion; for this man
who, like an intellectual athlete, has stood in the arena of debate and
challenged all comers, and who is still a total stranger to defeat.Like
an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine marched down the
halls of the American Congress and threw his shining lance full and
fair against the brazen foreheads of the defamers of his country and the
maligners of her honor.For the Republican party to desert this gallant
leader now is as though an army should desert their General upon the
field of battle.James G. Blaine is now and has been for years the
bearer of the sacred standard of the Republican party.A Model Leader

The Republicans of the United States want a man who knows that this
Government should protect every citizen, at home and abroad; who knows
that any Government that will not defend its defenders and protect its
protectors is a disgrace to the map of the world.They demand a man who
believes in the eternal separation and divorcement of church and school.They demand a man whose political reputation is as spotless as a star;
but they do not demand that their candidate shall have a certificate of
moral character signed by a Confederate Congress.The man who has, in
full, heaped and rounded measure, all these splendid qualifications is
the present grand and gallant leader of the Republican party--James G.
Blaine.Our country, crowned with the vast and marvelous achievements
of its first century, asks for a man worthy of the past and prophetic
of her future; asks for a man who has the audacity of genius; asks for
a man who is the grandest combination of heart, conscience and brain
beneath her flag.Such a man is James G. Blaine.Abraham Lincoln

This world has not been fit to live in fifty years.There is no liberty
in it--very little.Why, it is only a few years ago that all the
Christian nations were engaged in the slave trade.It was not until 1808
that England abolished the slave trade, and up to that time her priests
in her churches and her judges on her benches owned stock in slave
ships, and luxuriated on the profits of piracy and murder; and when a
man stood up and denounced it they mobbed him as though he had been a
common burglar or a horse thief.It was not until the 28th
day of August, 1833, that England abolished slavery in her colonies; and
it was not until the 1st day of January, 1862, that Abraham Lincoln, by
direction of the entire North, wiped that infamy out of this country;
and I never speak of Abraham Lincoln but I want to say that he was, in
my judgment, in many respects the grandest man ever President of the
United States.I say that upon his tomb there ought to be this line--and
I know of no other man deserving it so well as he: "Here lies one who
having been clothed with almost absolute power never abused it except on
the side of mercy."Swedenborg

Swedenborg was a man of great intellect, of vast acquirements, and of
honest intentions; and I think it equally clear that upon one subject,
at least, his mind was touched, shattered and shaken.Misled by
analogies, imposed upon by the bishop, deceived by the woman, borne to
other worlds upon the wings of dreams, living in the twilight of reason
and the dawn of insanity, he regarded every fact as a patched and ragged
garment with a lining of the costliest silk, and insisted that the wrong
side, even of the silk, was far more beautiful than the right.Jeremy Bentham

The glory of Bentham is, that he gave the true basis of morals, and
furnished the statesmen with the star and compass of this sentence: "The
greatest happiness of the greatest number."Charles Fourier

Fourier sustained about the same relation to this world that Swedenborg
did to the other.There must be something wrong about the brain of one
who solemnly asserts that "the elephant, the ox and the diamond were
created by the Sun; the horse, the lily, and the ruby, by Saturn; the
cow, the jonquil and the topaz, by Jupiter; and the dog, the violet
and the opal stones by the earth itself."And yet, forgetting these
aberrations of the mind, this lunacy of a great and loving soul, for
one, that's in tender-est regard the memory of Charles Fourier, one of
the best and noblest of our race.Auguste Comte

There was in the brain of the great Frenchman--Auguste Comte--the dawn
of that happy day in which humanity will be the only religion, good the
only God, happiness the only object, restitution the only atonement,
mistake the only sin, and affection guided by intelligence, the only
savior of mankind.This dawn enriched his poverty, illuminated the
darkness of his life, peopled his loneliness with the happy millions yet
to be, and filled his eyes with proud and tender tears.When everything
connected with Napoleon, except his crimes, shall be forgotten, Auguste
Comte will be lovingly remembered as a benefactor of the human race.Herbert Spencer

Herbert Spencer relies upon evidence, upon demonstration, upon
experience; and occupies himself with one world at a time.He perceives
that there is a mental horizon that we cannot pierce, and that beyond
that is the unknown, possibly the unknowable.He endeavors to examine
only that which is capable of being examined, and considers the
theological method as not only useless, but hurtful.After all God is
but a guess, throned and established by arrogance and assertion.Turning his attention to those things that have in some way affected
the condition of mankind, Spencer leaves the unknowable to priests and
believers.Robert Collyer

I have the honor of a slight acquaintance with Robert Collyer.I have
read with pleasure some of his exquisite productions.He has a brain
full of the dawn, the head of a philosopher, the imagination of a poet
and the sincere heart of a child.Had such men as Robert Collyer and
John Stuart Mill been present at the burning of Servetus, they would
have extinguished the flames with their tears.Had the presbytery of
Chicago been there, they would have quietly turned their backs, solemnly
divided their coat tails, and warmed themselves.John Milton

England was filled with Puritan gloom and Episcopal ceremony.All
religious conceptions were of the grossest nature.The ideas of crazy
fanatics and extravagant poets were taken as sober facts.Milton had
clothed Christianity in the soiled and faded finery of the gods--had
added to the story of Christ the fables of Mythology, He gave to the
Protestant Church the most outrageously material ideas of the Deity.He turned all the angels into soldiers--made heaven a battlefield, put
Christ in uniform, and described God as a militia general.His works
were considered by the Protestants nearly as sacred as the Bible
itself, and the imagination of the people was thoroughly polluted by the
horrible imagery, the sublime absurdity of the blind Milton.Ernst Haeckel

Amongst the bravest, side by side with the greatest of the world in
Germany, the land of science--stands Ernst Haeckel, who may be said
not only to have demonstrated the theories of Darwin, but the monistic
conception of the world.He has endeavored--and I think with complete
success--to show that there is not, and never was, and never can be,
the creator of anything.Haeckel is one of the bitterest enemies of the
church, and is, therefore, one of the bravest friends of man.Professor Swing, a Dove amongst Vultures

Professor Swing was too good a man to stay in the Presbyterian Church.He was a rose amongst thistles; he was a dove amongst vultures; and they
hunted him out, and I am glad he came out.I have the greatest respect
for Professor Swing, but I want him to tell whether the 109th Psalm is
inspired.Queen Victoria and George Eliot

Compare George Eliot with Queen Victoria.The Queen is clad in garments
given her by blind fortune and unreasoning chance, while George Eliot
wears robes of glory woven in the loom of her own genius.The time is coming when men will be rated at their real
worth; when we shall care nothing for an officer if he does not fill his
place.Bough on Rabbi Bien

I will not answer Rabbi Bien, and I will tell you why.Because he has
taken himself outside of all the limits of a gentleman; because he has
taken upon himself to traduce American women in language the beastliest
I ever read; and any man who says that the American women are not just
as good women as any God can make, and pick his mind to-day, is an
unappreciative barbarian.I will let him alone because he denounced all
the men in this country, all the members of Congress, all the members
of the Senate, all the Judges on the bench, as thieves and robbers.I
pronounce him a vulgar falsifier, and let him alone.General Garfield

No man has been nominated for the office since I was born, by either
party, who had more brains and more heart than James A. Garfield.He
was a soldier, he is a statesman.In time of peace he preferred the
avocations of peace; when the bugle of war blew in his ears he withdrew
from his work and fought for the flag, and then he went back to the
avocation of peace.And I say to-day that a man who, in a time of
profound peace, makes up his mind that he would like to kill folks for
a living is no better, to say the least of it, than the man who loves
peace in the time of peace, and who, when his country is attacked,
rushes to the rescue of her flag."Wealthy in Integrity; In Brain a Millionaire."James A. Garfield is to-day a poor man, and you know that there is not
money enough in this magnificent street to buy the honor and manhood of
James A. Garfield.Money cannot make such a man, and I will swear to you
that money cannot buy him.James A. Garfield to-day wears the glorious
robe of honest poverty.He is a poor man; but I like to say it here in
Wall street; I like to say it surrounded by the millions of America; I
like to say it in the midst of banks, and bonds, and stocks; I love to
say it where gold is piled--that, although a poor man, he is rich in
honor, in integrity he is wealthy, and in brain he is a millionaire.Garfield a Certificate of the Splendor of the American Constitution

Garfield is a certificate of the splendor of our Government, that says
to every poor boy: "All the avenues of honor are open to you."He is a scholar; he is a statesman; he was a
soldier; he is a patriot; and above all he is a magnificent man, and if
every man in New York knew him as well as I do, Garfield would not lose
a hundred votes in this city.W. Hiram Thomas

The best thing that has come from the other side is from Dr.I
regard him as by far the grandest intellect in the Methodist Church.He
is intellectually a wide and tender man.I cannot conceive of an article
being written in a better spirit.He finds a little fault with me for
not being exactly fair.Thomas
the probability is I never should have laid myself liable to criticism.There is some human nature in me, and I find it exceedingly difficult
to preserve at all times perfect serenity.I have the greatest possible
respect for Dr.Thomas, and must heartily thank him for his perfect
fairness.MISCELLANEOUS




355.Heresy and Orthodoxy

It has always been the man ahead that has been called the heretic.Heresy is the last and best thought always!Heresy extends the
hospitality of the brain to a new idea; that is what the rotting says to
flax growing; that is what the dweller in the swamp says to the man on
the sun-lit hill; that is what the man in the darkness cries out to the
grand man upon whose forehead is shining the dawn of a grander day; that
is what the coffin says to the cradle.Orthodoxy is a kind of shroud,
and heresy is a banner--Orthodoxy is a fog and Heresy a star shining
forever upon the cradle of truth.I do not mean simply in religion, I
mean in everything and the idea I wish to impress upon you is that you
should keep your minds open to all the influences of nature, you should
keep your minds open to reason; hear what a man has to say, and do not
let the turtle-shell of bigotry grow above your brain.Give everybody a
chance and an opportunity; that is all.We used to worship the golden calf, and the worst you can say of us now,
is, we worship the gold of the calf, and even the calves are beginning
to see this distinction.We used to go down on our knees to every man
that held office, now he must fill it if he wishes any respect.We care
nothing for the rich, except what will they do with their money?How does he fill it?--that is the question.And there is rapidly growing
up in the world an aristocracy of heart and brain--the only aristocracy
that has a right to exist.Truth will Bear the Test

If a man has a diamond that has been examined by the lapidaries of the
world, and some ignorant stonecutter told him that it is nothing but
an ordinary rock, he laughs at him; but if it has not been examined
by lapidaries, and he is a little suspicious himself that it is not
genuine, it makes him mad.Any doctrine that will not bear investigation
is not a fit tenant for the mind of an honest man.Any man who is afraid
to have his doctrine investigated is not only a coward but a hypocrite.Paring Nails

Why should we in this age of the world be dominated by the dead?Why
should barbarian Jews who went down to death and dust three thousand
years ago, control the living world?Why should we care for the
superstition of men who began the sabbath by paring their nails,
"beginning at the fourth finger, then going to the second, then to the
fifth, then to the third, and ending with the thumb?"How pleasing to
God this must have been.There may be a God

There may be for aught I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast,
some being whose dreams are constellations and within whose thought the
infinite exists.About this being, if such an one exists, I have nothing
to say.He has written no books, inspired no barbarians, required no
worship, and has prepared no hell in which to burn the honest seeker
after truth.The People are Beginning to Think

The people are beginning to think, to reason and to investigate.Slowly,
painfully, but surely, the gods are being driven from the earth.Only
upon rare occasions are they, even by the most religious, supposed to
interfere in the affairs of men.In most matters we are at last supposed
to be free.Since the invention of steamships and railways, so that the
products of all countries can be easily interchanged, the gods have quit
the business of producing famine.Unchained Thought

For the vagaries of the clouds the infidels propose to substitute the
realities of earth; for superstition, the splendid demonstrations and
achievements of science; and for theological tyranny, the chainless
liberty of thought.Man the Victor of the Future

If abuses are destroyed, man must destroy them.If slaves are freed, man
must free them.If new truths are discovered, man must discover them.If the naked are clothed; if the hungry are fed; if justice is done;
if labor is rewarded; if superstition is driven from the mind; if the
defenseless are protected, and if the right finally triumphs, all must
be the work of man.The grand victories of the future must be won by
man, and by man alone.The Sacred Sabbath

Of all the superstitious of mankind, this insanity about the "sacred
Sabbath" is the most absurd.The idea of feeling it a duty to be solemn
and sad one-seventh of the time!To think that we can please an infinite
being by staying in some dark and sombre room, instead of walking in the
perfumed fields!Why should God hate to see a man happy?Why should it
excite his wrath to see a family in the woods, by some babbling stream,
talking, laughing and loving?Nature works on that "sacred" day.The
earth turns, the rivers run, the trees grow, buds burst into flower, and
birds fill the air with song.Why should we look sad, and think about
death, and hear about-hell?Why should that day be filled with gloom
instead of joy?Make the Sabbath Merry

Freethinkers should make the Sabbath a day of mirth and music; a day to
spend with wife and child--a day of games, and books, and dreams--a day
to put fresh flowers above our sleeping dead--a day of memory and hope,
of love and rest.Away to the Hills and the Sea

A poor mechanic, working all the week in dust and noise, needs a day of
rest and joy, a day to visit stream and wood--a day to live with wife
and child; a day in which to laugh at care, and gather hope and strength
for toils to come.And his weary wife needs a breath of sunny air, away
from street and wall, amid the hills or by the margin of the sea, where
she can sit and prattle with her babe, and fill with happy dreams the
long, glad day.Melancholy Sundays

When I was a little fellow most everybody thought that some days were
too sacred for the young ones to enjoy themselves in.Sunday used to commence Saturday night at sundown, under
the old text, "The evening and the morning were the first day."They
commenced then, I think, to get a good ready.When the sun went down
Saturday night, darkness ten thousand times deeper than ordinary night
fell upon that house.The boy that looked the sickest was regarded as
the most pious.You could not crack hickory nuts that night, and if you
were caught chewing gum it was another evidence of the total depravity
of the human heart.We would sometimes
sing, "Another day has passed."Everybody looked as though they had the
dyspesia--you know lots of people think they are pious, just because
they are bilious, as Mr.It was a solemn night, and the next
morning the solemnity had increased.Then we went to church, and the
minister was in a pulpit about twenty feet high.If it was in the winter
there was no fire; it was not thought proper to be comfortable while you
were thanking the Lord.The minister commenced at firstly and ran up to
about twenty-fourthly, and then he divided it up again; and then he
made some concluding remarks, and then he said lastly, and when he said
lastly he was about half through.Moses took Egyptian Law for his Model

It has been contended for many years that the ten commandments are the
foundation of all ideas of justice and of law.Eminent jurists have
bowed to popular prejudice, and deformed their works by statements to
the effect that the Mosaic laws are the fountains from which sprang all
ideas of right and wrong.Nothing can be more stupidly false than such
assertions.Thousands of years before Moses was born, the Egyptians
had a code of laws.They had laws against blasphemy, murder, adultery,
larceny, perjury, laws for the collection of debts, and the enforcement
of contracts.A False Standard of Success

It is not necessary to be rich, nor powerful, nor great, to be a
success; and neither is it necessary to have your name between the
putrid lips of rumor to be great.We have had a false standard of
success.In the years when I was a little boy we read in our books that
no fellow was a success that did not make a fortune or get a big office,
and he generally was a man that slept about three hours a night.They
never put down in the books the gentlemen who succeeded in life and yet
slept all they wanted to.Toilers and Idlers

You can divide mankind into two classes: the laborers and the idlers,
the supporters and the supported, the honest and the dishonest.Every
man is dishonest who lives upon the unpaid labor of others, no matter
if he occupies a throne.The laborers
should have equal-rights before the world and before the law.And I want
every farmer to consider every man who labors either with hand or brain
as his brother.Until genius and labor formed a partnership there was
no such thing as prosperity among men.Every reaper and mower, every
agricultural implement, has elevated the work of the farmer, and his
vocation grows grander with every invention.In the olden time the
agriculturist was ignorant; he knew nothing of machinery, he was the
slave of superstition.The Sad Wilderness History

While reading the Pentateuch, I am filled with indignation, pity and
horror.Nothing can be sadder than the history of the starved and
frightened wretches who wandered over the desolate crags and sands of
wilderness and desert, the prey of famine, sword and plague.Ignorant
and superstitious to the last degree, governed by falsehood, plundered
by hypocrisy, they were the sport of priests, and the food of fear.God
was their greatest enemy, and death their only friend.Law Much Older than Sinai

Laws spring from the instinct of self-preservation.Industry objected
to supporting idleness, and laws were made against theft.Laws were made
against murder, because a very large majority of the people have always
objected to being murdered.All fundamental laws were born simply of the
instinct of self-defence.Long before the Jewish savages assembled at
the foot of Sinai, laws had been made and enforced, not only in Egypt
and India, but by every tribe that ever existed.God raised the black flag, and
commanded his soldiers to kill even the smiling infant in its mother's
arms.Who is the blasphemer; the man who denies the existence of God, or
he who covers the robes of the infinite with innocent blood?Standing Tip for God

We are told in the Pentateuch that God, the father of us all, gave
thousands of maidens, after having killed their fathers, their mothers,
and their brothers, to satisfy the brutal lusts of savage men.If there
be a God, I pray him to write in his book, opposite my name, that I
denied this lie for him.Matter and Force

The statement in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, I
cannot accept.It is contrary to my reason, and I cannot believe it.It
appears reasonable for me that force has existed from eternity.Force
cannot, as it appears to me, exist apart from matter.Force, in its
nature, is forever active, and without matter it could not act; and so
I think matter must have existed forever.To conceive of matter without
force, or of force without matter, or of a time when neither existed,
or of a being who existed for an eternity without either, and who out of
nothing created both, is to me utterly impossible.It may be that I am led to these conclusions by "total depravity," or
that I lack the necessary humility of spirit to satisfactorily harmonize
Haeckel and Moses; or that I am carried away by pride, blinded by
reason, given over to hardness of heart that I might be damned, but I
never can believe that the earth was covered with leaves, and buds, and
flowers, and fruits, before the sun with glittering spear had driven
back the hosts of night.We are told that God made man; and the question naturally arises, how
was this done?Was it by a process of "evolution," "development;" the
"transmission of acquired habits;" the "survival of the fittest," or was
the necessary amount of clay kneaded to the proper consistency, and then
by the hands of God moulded into form?Modern science tells that man has
been evolved, through countless epochs, from the lower forms; that he
is the result of almost an infinite number of actions, reactions,
experiences, states, forms, wants and adaptations.General Joshua

My own opinion is that General Joshua knew no more about the motions of
the earth than he did mercy and justice.If he had known that the earth
turned upon its axis at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, and swept
in its course about the sun at the rate of sixty-eight thousand miles
an hour, he would have doubled the hailstones, spoken of in the same
chapter, that the Lord cast down from heaven, and allowed the sun and
moon to rise and set in the usual way.This getting up so early in the morning is a relic of barbarism.It has
made hundreds of thousands of young men curse business.There is no need
of getting up at three or four o'clock in the winter morning.The farmer
who persists in dragging his wife and children from their beds ought to
be visited by a missionary.It is time enough to rise after the sun has
set the example.Why
not feed them more the night before?In the old
times they used to get up about three o'clock in the morning, and go to
work long before the sun had risen with "healing upon his wings," and as
a just punishment they all had the ague; and they ought to have it now.Sleep is the best medicine
in the world.There is no such thing as health, without plenty of sleep.When you work, work;
and when you get through take a good, long and refreshing sleep.Never Rise at Four O'Clock

The man who cannot get a living upon Illinois soil without rising before
daylight ought to starve.Eight hours a day is enough for any farmer to
work except in harvest time.When you rise at four and work till dark
what is life worth?Of what use are all the improvements in farming?Of what use is all the improved machinery unless it tends to give the
farmer a little more leisure?What is harvesting now, compared with what
it was in the old time?Think of the days of reaping, of cradling, of
raking and binding and mowing.Think of threshing with the flail and
winnowing with the wind.And now think of the reapers and mowers, the
binders and threshing machines, the plows and cultivators, upon which
the farmer rides protected from the sun.If, with all these advantages,
you cannot get a living without rising in the middle of the night, go
into some other business.The Hermit is Mad

A hermit is a mad man.Without friends and wife and child, there is
nothing left worth living for.They
are filled with egotism and envy, with vanity and hatred.People who
live much alone become narrow and suspicious.They are apt to be the
property of one idea.They begin to think there is no use in anything.They look upon the happiness of others as a kind of folly.They hate
joyous folks, because, way down in their hearts, they envy them.Duke Orang-Outang

I think we came from the lower animals.I am not dead sure of it, but
think so.When I first read about it I didn't like it.My heart was
filled with sympathy for those people who leave nothing to be proud of
except ancestors.I thought how terrible this will be upon the nobility
of the old world.Think of their being forced to trace their ancestry
back to the Duke Orang-Outang or to the Princess Chimpanzee.After
thinking it all over I came to the conclusion that I liked that
doctrine.I read about
rudimentary bones and muscles.I was told that everybody had rudimentary
muscles extending from the ear into the cheek.I was told: "They are the remains of muscles; they became rudimentary
from the lack of use."They are the muscles
with which your ancestors used to flap their ears.Well, at first I was
greatly astonished, and afterward I was more astonished to find they had
become rudimentary.Self-Made Men

It is often said of this or that man that he is a self-made man--that
he was born of the poorest and humblest parents, and that with every
obstacle to overcome he became great.Most of the intellectual giants of the world
have been nursed at the sad but loving breast of poverty.Most of those
who have climbed highest on the shining ladder of fame commenced at the
lowest round.They were reared in the straw thatched cottages of Europe;
in the log houses of America; in the factories of the great cities; in
the midst of toil; in the smoke and din of labor.The One Window in the Ark

A cubit is twenty-two inches; so that the ark was five hundred and fifty
feet long, ninety-one feet and eight inches wide, and fifty-five feet
high.The ark was divided into three stories, and had on top, one window
twenty-two inches square.Ventillation must have been one of Jehovah's
hobbies.Think of a ship larger than the Great Eastern with only one
window, and that but twenty-two inches square!No Ante-Diluvian Camp-Meetings!It is a little curious that when God wished to reform the ante-diluvian
world he said nothing about hell; that he had no revivals, no
camp-meetings, no tracts, no out-pourings of the Holy Ghost, no
baptisms, no noon prayer meetings, and never mentioned the great
doctrine of salvation by faith.If the orthodox creeds of the world are
true, all those people went to hell without ever having heard that such
a place existed.If eternal torment is a fact, surely these miserable
wretches ought to have been warned.They were threatened only with water
when they were in fact doomed to eternal fire!Hard Work in the Ark

Eight persons did all the work.They attended to the wants of 175,000
birds, 3,616 beasts, 1,300 reptiles, and 2,000,000 insects, saying
nothing of countless animalculae.Can we believe that the inspired writer had any idea of the size of the
sun?Draw a circle five inches in diameter, and by its side thrust a pin
through the paper.The hole made by the pin will sustain about the same
relation to the circle that the earth does to the sun.Did he know that
the sun was eight hundred and sixty thousand miles in diameter; that it
was enveloped in an ocean of fire thousands of miles in depth, hotter
even than the Christian's hell?Did he know that the volume of the Earth
is less than one-millionth of that of the sun?Did he know of the one
hundred and four planets belonging to our solar system, all children of
the sun?Did he know of Jupiter eighty-five thousand miles in diameter,
hundreds of times as large as our earth, turning on his axis at the rate
of twenty-five thousand miles an hour accompanied by four moons making
the tour of his orbit once only in fifty years?Something for Nothing

It is impossible for me to conceive of something being created for
nothing.Nothing, regarded in the light of raw material, is a decided
failure.Neither is it
possible to think of force disconnected with matter.You cannot imagine
matter going back to absolute nothing.Neither can you imagine nothing
being changed into something.You may be eternally damned if you do not
say that you can conceive these things, but you cannot conceive them.Polygamy

Polygamy is just as pure in Utah as it could have been in the promised
land.Love and virtue are the same the whole world around, and justice
is the same in every star.All the languages of the world are not
sufficient to express the filth of polygamy.It makes of man a beast,
of woman a trembling slave.It destroys the fireside, makes virtue an
outcast, takes from human speech its sweetest words, and leaves the
heart a den, where crawl and hiss the slimy serpents of most loathsome
lust.The good family is the unit
of good government.The virtues grow about the holy hearth of home--they
cluster, bloom, and shed their perfume round the fireside where the
one man loves the one woman.Lover--husband--wife--mother--father--child--home!--without these sacred
words the world is but a lair, and men and women merely beasts.The Colonel in the Kitchen--How to Cook a Beefsteak

There ought to be a law making it a crime, punishable by imprisonment,
to fry a beefsteak.Broil it; it is just as easy, and when broiled it
is delicious.Fried beefsteak is not fit for a wild beast.You can broil
even on a stove.Shut the front damper--open the back one, and then take
off a griddle.There will then be a draft down through this opening.Put
on your steak, using a wire broiler, and not a particle of smoke will
touch it, for the reason that the smoke goes down.If you try to broil
it with the front damper open the smoke will rise.For broiling, coal,
even soft coal, makes a better fire than wood.Do not huddle together in a little room
around a red-hot stove, with every window fastened down.Do not live in
this poisoned atmosphere, and then, when one of your children dies, put
a piece in the papers commencing with, "Whereas, it has pleased divine
Providence to remove from our midst--."Have plenty of air, and plenty
of warmth.Do not imagine anything is unhealthy
simply because it is pleasant.Cooking a Fine Art

Cooking is one of the fine arts.Give your wives and daughters things to
cook, and things to cook with, and they will soon become most excellent
cooks.The man whose arteries
and veins are filled with rich blood made of good and well cooked food,
has pluck, courage, endurance and noble impulses.Remember that your
wife should have things to cook with.Scathing Impeachment of Intemperance

Intemperance cuts down youth in its vigor, manhood in its strength, and
age in its weakness.It breaks the father's heart, bereaves the doting
mother, extinguishes natural affections, erases conjugal loves, blots
out filial attachments, blights parental hope, and brings down mourning
age in sorrow to the grave.It produces weakness, not strength;
sickness, not health; death, not life.It makes wives widows; children
orphans; fathers fiends, and all of them paupers and beggars.It feeds
rheumatism, nurses gout, welcomes epidemics, invites cholera, imports
pestilence and embraces consumption.It covers the land with idleness,
misery and crime.It fills your jails, supplies your almshouses and
demands your asylums.It engenders controversies, fosters quarrels, and
cherishes riots.It crowds your penitentiaries and furnishes victims to
your scaffolds.It is the life blood of the gambler, the element of
the burglar, the prop of the highwayman and the support of the midnight
incendiary.It countenances the liar, respects the thief, esteems
the blasphemer.It violates obligations, reverences fraud, and honors
infamy.It defames benevolence, hates love, scorns virtue and slanders
innocence.It incites the father to butcher his helpless offspring,
helps the husband to massacre his wife, and the child to grind the
parricidal ax.It burns up men, consumes women, detests life, curses God,
and despises heaven.It suborns witnesses, nurses perjury, defiles
the jury box, and stains the judicial ermine.It degrades the citizen,
debases the legislator, dishonors statesmen, and disarms the patriot.It
brings shame, not honor; terror, not safety; despair, not hope; misery,
not happiness; and with the malevolence of a fiend, it calmly surveys
its frightful desolation, and unsatisfied with its havoc, it poisons
felicity, kills peace, ruins morals, blights confidence, slays
reputation, and wipes out national honors, then curses the world and
laughs at its ruin.Liberty Defined

The French convention gave the best definition of liberty I have ever
read: "The liberty of one citizen ceases only where the liberty of
another citizen commences."I ask you
to-day to make a declaration of individual independence.And if you are
independent, be just.Allow everybody else to make his declaration of
individual independence.Allow your wife, allow your husband, allow
your children to make theirs.It is a grand thing to be the owner of
yourself.It is a grand thing to protect the rights of others.It is a
sublime thing to be free and just.Free, Honest Thought

I am going to say what little I can to make the American people brave
enough and generous enough and kind enough to give everybody else the
rights they have themselves.Can there ever be any progress in this
world to amount to anything until we have liberty?The thoughts of a man
who is not free are not worth much--not much.A man who thinks with the
club of a creed above his head--a man who thinks casting his eye askance
at the flames of hell, is not apt to have very good thoughts.And for
my part, I would not care to have any status or social position even in
heaven if I had to admit that I never would have been there only I got
scared.When we are frightened we do not think very well.If you want to
get at the honest thoughts of a man he must free.If he is not free you
will not get his honest thought.Ingersoll Prefers Shoemakers to Princes

The other day there came shoemakers, potters, workers in wood and iron,
from Europe, and they were received in the city of New York as though
they had been princes.They had been sent by the great republic of
France to examine into the arts and manufactures of the great republic
of America.They looked a thousand times better to me than the Edward
Alberts and Albert Edwards--the royal vermin, that live on the body
politic.And I would think much more of our government if it would fete
and feast them, instead of wining and dining the imbeciles of a royal
line.I never saw a dignified man that was not after all an
old idiot Dignity is a mask; a dignified man is afraid that you will
know he does not know everything.A man of sense and argument is always
willing to admit what he don't know--why?--because there is so much
that he does know; and that is the first step towards learning
anything--willingness to admit what you don't know, and when you don't
understand a thing, ask--no matter how small and silly it may look to
other people--ask, and after that you know.A man never is in a state of
mind that he can learn until he gets that dignified nonsense out of him.The time is coming when a man will be rated at his real worth, and that
by his brain and heart.We care nothing now about an officer unless he
fills his place.The time will come when no matter how much money a man
has he will not be respected unless he is using it for the benefit of
his fellow-men.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen
States to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the
conveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes
two hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves
his friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the
obligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest
sympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for
himself, is the true nobleman.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of
the air and have given one country to mankind.Wanted!--More Manliness

I had a thousand times rather have a farm and be independent, than to be
President of the United States, without independence, filled with
doubt and trembling, feeling of the popular pulse, resorting to art and
artifice, inquiring about the wind of opinion, and succeeding at last in
losing my self-respect without gaining the respect of others.Man needs
more manliness, more real independence.This we can do by labor, and in this way we can preserve our
independence.We should try and choose that business or profession the
pursuit of which will give us the most happiness.We can be happy without being rich--without holding office--without
being famous.I am not sure that we can be happy with wealth, with
office, or with fame.Education of Nature

It has been a favorite idea with me that our forefathers were educated
by nature; that they grew grand as the continent upon which they landed;
that the great rivers--the wide plains--the splendid lakes--the lonely
forests--the sublime mountains--that all these things stole into and
became a part of their being, and they grew great as the country in
which they lived.They began to hate the narrow, contracted views of
Europe.The Worker Wearing the Purple

I want to see a workingman have a good house, painted white, grass in
the front yard, carpets on the floor and pictures on the wall.I want to
see him a man feeling that he is a king by the divine right of living in
the Republic.And every man here is just a little bit a king, you know.Every man here is a part of the sovereign power.Every man wears a
little of purple; every man has a little of crown and a little of
sceptre; and every man that will sell his vote for money or be ruled by
prejudice is unfit to be an American citizen.Flowers

Beautify your grounds with plants and flowers and vines.Remember that everything of beauty tends to the elevation of
man.Every little morning-glory whose purple bosom is thrilled with the
amorous kisses of the sun tends to put a blossom in your heart.Do not
judge of the value of everything by the market reports.Every flower
about a house certifies to the refinement of somebody.Every vine,
climbing and blossoming, tells of love and joy.The grave is not a throne, and a corpse is not a king.The living have
a right to control this world.I think a good deal more of to day than
I do of yesterday, and I think more of to-morrow than I do of this day;
because it is nearly gone--that is the way I feel.The time to be happy
is now; the way to be happy is to make somebody else happy and the place
to be happy is here.The School House a Fort

Education is the most radical thing in the world.To teach the alphabet is to inaugurate a revolution.To build a school
house is to construct a fort.We are Getting Free

We are getting free.We are
investigating with the microscope and the telescope.We are digging
into the earth and finding souvenirs of all the ages.We are finding out
something about the laws of health and disease.We are adding years to
the span of human life and we are making the world fit to live in.That is what we are doing, and every man that has an honest thought and
expresses it helps, and every man that tries to keep honest thought from
being expressed is an obstruction and a hindrance.The Solid Rock

I have made up my mind that if there is a God He will be merciful to the
merciful.That He will forgive the forgiving;
upon that rock I stand.That every man should be true to himself, and
that there is no world, no star, in which honesty is a crime; and upon
that rock I stand.An honest man, a good, kind, sweet woman, or a happy
child, has nothing to fear, neither in this world nor the world to come;
and upon that rock I stand.INGERSOLL'S FIVE GOSPELS




408.The Gospel of Cheerfulness

I believe in the gospel of cheerfulness; the gospel of good nature; in
the gospel of good health.Let us pay some attention to our bodies; take
care of our bodies, and our souls will take care of themselves.I believe the time will come when the public thought will be so
great and grand that it will be looked upon as infamous to perpetuate
disease.I believe the time will come when men will not fill the future
with consumption and with insanity.I believe the time will come when
with studying ourselves and understanding the laws of health, we will
say we are under obligations to put the flags of health in the cheeks of
our children.Even if I got to Heaven, and had a harp, I would hate to
look back upon my children and see them diseased, deformed, crazed, all
suffering the penalty of crimes that I had committed.The Gospel of Liberty

And I believe, too, in the gospel of liberty,---of giving to others what
we claim.And I believe there is room everywhere for thought, and
the more liberty you give away the more you will have.In liberty
extravagance is economy.Let us be just, let us be generous to each
other.The Gospel of 'Good Living

I believe in the gospel of good living.You cannot make any God happy by
fasting.Let us have good food, and let us have it well cooked; it is
a thousand times better to know how to cook it than it is to understand
any theology in the world.I
believe in the gospel of good houses; in the gospel of water and soap.The Gospel of Intelligence

I believe in the gospel of intelligence.That is the only lever capable
of raising mankind.I believe in the gospel of intelligence; in the
gospel of education.The school-house is my cathedral; the universe
is my Bible.And no God can put a man into hell in another world who has
made a little heaven in this.God cannot make miserable a man who has
made somebody else happy.God can not hate anybody who is capable of
loving his neighbor.So I believe in this great gospel of generosity.Ah, but they say it won't do.My gospel
of health will prolong life; my gospel of intelligence, my gospel of
loving, my gospel of good-fellowship will cover the world with happy
homes.My doctrine will put carpets upon your floors, pictures upon your
walls.My doctrine will put books upon your shelves, ideas in your mind.My doctrine will relieve the world of the abnormal monsters born of the
ignorance of superstition.My doctrine will give us health, wealth, and
happiness.The Gospel of Justice

I believe in the gospel of justice,--that we must reap what we sow.Smith, and God forgive me,
how does that help Smith?If I by slander cover some poor girl with
the leprosy of some imputed crime, and she withers away like a blighted
flower, and afterwards I get forgiveness, how does that help her?If
there is another world, we have got to settle; no bankruptcy court
there.Among the ancient Jews if you committed a crime you
had to kill a sheep; now they say, "Charge it.For every crime you commit you must answer to yourself and
to the one you injure.And if you have ever clothed another with
unhappiness as with a garment cf pain, you will never be quite as
happy as though you hadn't done that thing.No forgiveness, eternal,
inexorable, everlasting justice--that is what I believe in.And if it goes hard with me, I will stand it.And I will stick to my
logic, and I will bear it like a man.GEMS FROM THE CONTROVERSIAL GASKET

     Latest Utterances of Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll,
     in a Controversy with Judge Jere 8.Black,
     on "The Christian Religion"




413.The Origin of the Controversy

Several months ago, _The North American Review_ asked me to write an
article, saying that it would be published if some one would furnish a
reply.I wrote the article that appeared in the August number, and by
me it was entitled "Is All of the Bible Inspired?"Not until the
article was written did I know who was expected to answer.I make this
explanation for the purpose of dissipating the impression that Mr.To have struck his shield with my lance might
have given birth to the impression that I was somewhat doubtful as to
the correctness of my position.I naturally expected an answer from some
professional theologian, and was surprised to find that a reply had been
written by a "policeman," who imagined that he had answered my arguments
by simply telling me that my statements were false.It is somewhat
unfortunate that in a discussion like this any one should resort to the
slightest personal detraction.The theme is great enough to engage the
highest faculties of the human mind, and in the investigation of such a
subject vituperation is singularly and vulgarly out of place.Arguments
cannot be answered with insults.It is unfortunate that the intellectual
arena should be entered by a "policeman," who has more confidence in
concussion than discussion.Good nature is often
mistaken for virtue, and good health sometimes passes for genius.Anger blows out the lamp of the mind.In the examination of a great and
important question, every one should be serene, slow-pulsed, and calm.Black's reply, feeling that so
grand a subject should not be blown and tainted with malicious words, I
proceed to answer as best I may the arguments he has urged.Of course it is still claimed that we are a Christian people, indebted
to something we call Christianity, for all the progress we have made.There is still a vast difference of opinion as to what Christianity
really is, although many wavering sects have been discussing that
question, with fire and sword through centuries of creed and crime.Every new sect has been denounced at its birth as illegitimate, as
something born out of orthodox wedlock, and that should have been
allowed to perish on the steps where it was found.Summary of Evangelical Belief

Among the evangelical churches there is a substantial agreement
upon what they consider the fundamental truths of the gospel.These
fundamental truths, as I understand them, are:--That there is a personal
God, the creator of the material universe; that he made man of the dust,
and woman from part of the man; that the man and woman were tempted by
the devil; that they were turned out of the garden of Eden; that, about
fifteen hundred years afterward, God's patience having been exhausted by
the wickedness of mankind, He drowned His children, with the exception
of eight persons; that afterward He selected from their descendants
Abraham, and through him the Jewish people; that He gave laws to these
people, and tried to govern them in all things; that He made known His
will in many ways; that He wrought a vast number of miracles; that
He inspired men to write the Bible; that, in the fullness of time, it
having been found impossible to reform mankind, this God came upon earth
as a child born of the Virgin Mary; that He lived in Palestine; that He
preached for about three years, going from place to place, occasionally
raising the dead, curing the blind and the halt; that He was
crucified--for the crime of blasphemy, as the Jews supposed, but, that
as a matter of fact, He was offered as a sacrifice for the sins of
all who might have faith in Him; that He was raised from the dead and
ascended into heaven, where He now is, making intercession for His
followers; that He will forgive the sins of all who believe on Him,
and that those who do not believe will be consigned to the dungeons of
eternal pain.These--(it may be with the addition of the sacraments of
Baptism and the Last Supper)--constitute what is generally known as the
Christian religion.A Profound Change in the World of Thought

A profound change has taken place in the world of thought.The pews are
trying to set themselves somewhat above the pulpit.The layman discusses
theology with the minister, and smiles.Christians excuse themselves
for belonging to the church by denying a part of the creed.The idea
is abroad that they who know the most of nature believe the least about
theology.The sciences are regarded as infidels, and facts as scoffers.Thousands of most excellent people avoid churches, and, with few
exceptions, only those attend prayer meetings who wish to be alone.The
pulpit is losing because the people are rising.The Believer in the Inspiration of the Bible has too Much to Believe

But the believer in the inspiration of the Bible is compelled to declare
that there was a time when slavery was right--when men could buy and
women sell their babes.He is compelled to insist that there was a time
when polygamy was the highest form of virtue; when wars of extermination
were waged with the sword of mercy; when religious toleration was a
crime, and when death was the just penalty for having expressed an
honest thought.He must maintain that Jehovah is just as bad now as he
was four thousand years ago, or that he was just as good then as he is
now, but that human conditions have so changed that slavery, polygamy,
religious persecutions and wars of conquest are now perfectly devilish.Once they were right--once they were commanded by God himself; now, they
are prohibited.There has been such a change in the conditions of man
that, at the present time, the devil is in favor of slavery, polygamy,
religious persecution and wars of conquest.That is to say, the devil
entertains the same opinion to-day that Jehovah held four thousand
years ago, but in the meantime Jehovah has remained exactly the
same--changeless and incapable of change.A Frank Admission

It is most cheerfully admitted that a vast number of people not only
believe these things, but hold them in exceeding reverence, and imagine
them to be of the utmost importance to mankind.They regard the Bible as
the only light that God has given for the guidance of His children; that
it is the one star in nature's sky--the foundation of all morality, of
all law, of all order, and of all individual and national progress.They
regard it as the only means we have for ascertaining the will of God,
the origin of man, and the destiny of the soul.The mistake has hindered in countless ways the civilization of
man.The Bible Should be Better than any other Book

In all ages of which any record has been preserved, there have been
those who gave their ideas of justice, charity, liberty, love, and
law.Now, if the Bible is really the work of God, it should contain the
grandest and sublimest truths.It should, in all respects, excel the
works of man.Within that book should be found the best and loftiest
definitions of justice; the truest conceptions of human liberty; the
clearest outlines of duty; the tenderest, the highest, and the noblest
thoughts,--not that the human mind has produced, but that the human mind
is capable of receiving.Upon every page should be found the luminous
evidence of its divine origin.Unless it contains grander and more
wonderful things than man has written, we are not only justified in
saying, but we are compelled to say, that it was written by no being
superior to man.A Serious Charge

The Bible has been the fortress and the defense of nearly every crime.No civilized country could re-enact its laws.And in many respects its
moral code is abhorrent to every good and tender man.It is admitted,
however, that many of its precepts are pure, that many of its laws are
wise and just, and that many of its statements are absolutely true.If the Bible is Not Verbally Inspired, What Then?It may be said that it is unfair to call attention to certain bad things
in the Bible, while the good are not so much as mentioned.To this it
may be replied that a divine being would not put bad things in a book.Certainly a being of infinite intelligence, power, and goodness could
never fall below the ideal of "depraved and barbarous" man.It will not
do, after we find that the Bible upholds what we now call crimes, to say
that it is not verbally inspired.If the words are not inspired, what
is?It may be said that the thoughts are inspired.But this would
include only the thoughts expressed without words.If the ideas are
inspired, they must be contained in and expressed only by inspired
words; that is to say, the arrangement of the words, with relation to
each other, must have been inspired.A Hindu Example

Suppose that we should now discover a Hindu book of equal antiquity with
the Old Testament, containing a defense of slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution, would we regard it as evidence
that the writers were inspired by an infinitely wise and merciful God?A Test Fairly Applied

Suppose we knew that after "inspired" men had finished the Bible, the
devil had got possession of it and wrote a few passages, what part of
the sacred Scriptures would Christians now pick out as being probably
his work?Which of the following passages would naturally be selected
as having been written by the devil--"Love thy neighbor as thyself," or
"Kill all the males among the little ones, and kill every woman; but all
the women children keep alive for yourselves?"It will hardly be claimed at this day, that the passages in the
Bible upholding slavery, polygamy, war, and religious persecution are
evidences of the inspiration of that book.Suppose that there had been
nothing in the Old Testament upholding these crimes would any modern
Christian suspect that it was not inspired on account of that omission?Suppose that there had been nothing in the Old Testament but laws in
favor of these crimes, would any intelligent Christian now contend that
it was the work of the true God?Proofs of Civilization

We know that there was a time in the history of almost every nation when
slavery, polygamy, and wars of extermination were regarded as divine
institutions; when women were looked upon as beasts of burden, and when,
among some people, it was considered the duty of the husband to murder
the wife for differing with him on the subject of religion.Nations that
entertain these views to-day are regarded as savage, and, probably, with
the exception of the South Sea islanders, the Feejees, some citizens
of Delaware, and a few tribes in Central Africa, no human beings can be
found degraded enough to agree upon these subjects with the Jehovah of
the ancient Jews.The only evidence we have, or can have, that a
nation has ceased to be savage is the fact that it has abandoned these
doctrines.To every one, except the theologian, it is perfectly easy to
account for the mistakes, atrocities, and crimes of the past, by
saying that civilization is a slow and painful growth; that the moral
perceptions are cultivated through ages of tyranny, of want, of crime,
and of heroism; that it requires centuries for man to put out the eyes
of self and hold in lofty and in equal poise the scales of justice;
that conscience is born of suffering; that mercy is the child of the
imagination--of the power to put oneself in the sufferers place, and
that man advances only as he becomes acquainted with his surroundings,
with the mutual obligations of life, and learns to take advantage of the
forces of nature.A Persian Gospel

Do not misunderstand me.My position is that the cruel passages in
the Old Testament are not inspired; that slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution always have been, are, and
forever will be, abhorred and cursed by the honest, virtuous, and the
loving; that the innocent cannot justly suffer for the guilty, and that
vicarious vice and vicarious virtue are equally absurd; that eternal
punishment is eternal revenge; that only the natural can happen; that
miracles prove the dishonesty of the few and the credulity of the many;
and that, according to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, salvation does not
depend upon belief, nor the atonement, nor a "second birth," but that
these gospels are in exact harmony with the declaration of the great
Persian: "Taking the first footstep with the good thought, the second
with the good word, and the third with the good deed, I entered
paradise."The dogmas of the past no longer reach the level of the
highest thought, nor satisfy the hunger of the heart.While dusty
faiths, embalmed and sepulchered in ancient texts, remain the same,
the sympathies of men enlarge; the brain no longer kills its young; the
happy lips give liberty to honest thoughts; the mental firmament expands
and lifts; the broken clouds drift by; the hideous dreams, the foul,
misshapen children of the monstrous night, dissolve and fade.Man the Author of all Books

So far as we know, man is the author of all books.If a book had been
found on the earth by the first man, he might have regarded it as the
work of God; but as men were here a good while before any books were
found, and as man has produced a great many books, the probability is
that the Bible is no exception.God and Brahma

Can we believe that God ever said of any: "Let his children be
fatherless and his wife a widow; let his children be continually
vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also out of their desolate
places; let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the stranger
spoil his labor, let there be none to extend mercy unto him, neither let
there be any to favor his fatherless children."If he ever said these
words, surely he had never heard this line, this strain of music, from
the Hindu: "Sweet is the lute to those who have not heard the prattle of
their own children."Jehovah, "from the clouds and darkness of Sinai,"
said to the Jews: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me.... Thou
shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."Contrast this with the words put by the Hindu in the mouth of Brahma:
"I am the same to all mankind.They who honestly serve other gods,
involuntarily worship me.I am he who partaketh of all worship, and I
am the reward of all worshipers."The first, a
dungeon where crawl the things begot of jealous slime; the other, great
as the domed firmament inlaid with suns.Matthew, Mark, and Luke

And I here take occasion to say, that with most of the teachings of the
gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke I most heartily agree.The miraculous
parts must, of course, be thrown aside.I admit that the necessity of
belief, the atonement, and the scheme of salvation are all set forth
in the Gospel of John,--a gospel, in my opinion, not written until long
after the others.Christianity Takes no Step in Advance

All the languages of the world have not words of horror enough to
paint the agonies of man when the church had power.Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, Nero, Domitian, and Commodus were not as cruel, false,
and base as many of the Christian Popes.Opposite the names of these
imperial criminals write John the XII., Leo the VIII., Boniface the VII.,
Benedict the IX., Innocent the III., and Alexander the VI.Was it under
these pontiffs that the "church penetrated the moral darkness like a
new sun," and covered the globe with institutions of mercy?Rome was far
better when Pagan than when Catholic.It was better to allow gladiators
and criminals to fight than to burn honest men.The greatest of Romans
denounced the cruelties of the arena.Seneca condemned the combats even
of wild beasts.He was tender enough to say that "we should have a bond
of sympathy for all sentiment beings, knowing that only the depraved
and base take pleasure in the sight of blood and suffering."Aurelius
compelled the gladiators to fight with blunted swords.Roman lawyers
declared that all men are by nature free and equal.Woman, under Pagan
rule in Rome, become as free as man.Zeno, long before the birth of
Christ, taught that virtue alone establishes a difference between men.We know that the Civil Law is the foundation of our codes.We know that
fragments of Greek and Roman art--a few manuscripts saved from Christian
destruction, some inventions and discoveries of the Moors--were the
seeds of modern civilization.Christianity, for a thousand years,
taught memory to forget and reason to believe.Not one step was taken in
advance.Over the manuscripts of philosophers and poets, priests, with
their ignorant tongues thrust out, devoutly scrawled the forgeries of
faith.Christianity a Mixture of Good and Evil

Mr.Black attributes to me the following expression: "Christianity is
pernicious in its moral effect, darkens the mind, narrows the soul,
arrests the progress of human society, and hinders civilization."Strange, that he is only able to answer what I did
not say.I endeavored to show that the passages in the Old Testament
upholding slavery, polygamy, wars of extermination, and religious
intolerance had filled the world with blood and crime.I admitted
that there are many wise and good things in the Old Testament.I also
insisted that the doctrine of the atonement--that is to say, of moral
bankruptcy--the idea that a certain belief is necessary to salvation,
and the frightful dogma of eternal pain, had narrowed the soul, had
darkened the mind, and had arrested the progress of human society.Like
other religions, Christianity is a mixture of good and evil.The church
has made more orphans than it has fed.It has never built asylums enough
to hold the insane of its own making.Jehovah, Epictetus and Cicero

If the Bible is really inspired, Jehovah commanded the Jewish people to
buy the children of the strangers that sojourned among them, and ordered
that the children thus bought should be an inheritance for the children
of the Jews, and that they should be bondmen and bondwomen forever.Yet
Epictetus, a man to whom no revelation was ever made, a man whose soul
followed only the light of nature, and who had never heard of the Jewish
God, was great enough to say: "Will you not remember that your servants
are by nature your brothers, the children of God?In saying that you
have bought them, you look down on the earth and into the pit, on the
wretched law of men long since dead,--but you see not the laws of the
Gods."We find that Jehovah, speaking to his chosen people, assured them
that their bondmen and bondmaids must be "of the heathen that were
round about them.""Of them," said Jehovah, "shall ye buy bondmen
and bondmaids."And yet Cicero, a pagan, Cicero, who had never been
enlightened by reading the Old Testament, had the moral grandeur to
declare: "They who say that we should love our fellow-citizens, but not
foreigners, destroy the universal brotherhood of mankind, with which
benevolence and justice would perish forever."The Atonement

In countless ways the Christian world has endeavored, for nearly two
thousand years, to explain the atonement, and every effort has ended in
an an mission that it cannot be understood, and a declaration that it
must be believed.Is it not immoral to teach that man can sin, that he
can harden his heart and pollute his soul, and that, by repenting
and believing something that he does not comprehend, he can avoid the
consequences of his crimes?Has the promise and hope of forgiveness ever
prevented the commission of a sin?Should men be taught that sin gives
happiness here; that they ought to bear the evils of a virtuous life in
this world for the sake of joy in the next; that they can repent between
the last sin and the last breath; that after repentance every stain
of the soul is washed away by the innocent blood of another; that the
serpent of regret will not hiss in the ear of memory; that the saved
will not even pity the victims of their own crimes; that the goodness
of another can be transferred to them; and that sins forgiven cease to
affect the unhappy wretches sinned against?Sin as a Debt

The Church says that the sinner is in debt to God, and that the
obligation is discharged by the Saviour.The best that can possibly be
said of such a transaction is, that the debt is transferred, not paid.The truth is, that a sinner is in debt to the person he has injured.If a man injures his neighbor, it is not enough for him to get the
forgiveness of God, but he must have the forgiveness of his neighbor.If a man puts his hand in the fire and God forgives him, his hand will
smart exactly the same.You must, after all, reap what you sow.No god
can give you wheat when you sow tares, and no devil can give you tares
when you sow wheat.The Logic of the Coffin

As to the doctrine of the atonement, Mr.Black has nothing to offer
except the barren statement that it is believed by the wisest and the
best.A Mohammedan, speaking in Constantinople, will say the same of the
Koran.A Brahman, in a Hindu temple, will make the same remark, and so
will the American Indian, when he endeavors to enforce something upon
the young of his tribe.He will say: "The best, the greatest of our
tribe have believed in this."This is the argument of the cemetery, the
philosophy of epitaphs, the logic of the coffin.We are the greatest and
wisest and most virtuous of mankind?This statement, that it has been
believed by the best, is made in connection with an admission that it
cannot be fathomed by the wisest.It is not claimed that a thing is
necessarily false because it is not understood, but I do claim that
it is not necessarily true because it cannot be comprehended.I still
insist that "the plan of redemption," as usually preached, is absurd,
unjust, and immoral.Judas Iscariot

For nearly two thousand years Judas Iscariot has been execrated by
mankind; and yet, if the doctrine of the atonement is true, upon his
treachery hung the plan of salvation.Suppose Judas had known of this
plan--known that he was selected by Christ for that very purpose, that
Christ was depending on him.And suppose that he also knew that only
by betraying Christ could he save either himself or others; what ought
Judas to have done?Are you willing to rely upon an argument that
justifies the treachery of that wretch?The Standard of Right

According to Mr.Black, the man who does not believe in a supreme being
acknowledges no standard of right and wrong in this world, and therefore
can have no theory of rewards and punishments in the next.Is it
possible that only those who believe in the God who persecuted for
opinion's sake have any standard of right and wrong?Were the greatest
men of all antiquity without this standard?In the eyes of intelligent
men of Greece and Rome, were all deeds, whether good or evil, morally
alike?Is it necessary to believe in the existence of an infinite
intelligence before you can have any standard of right and wrong?Is it
possible that a being cannot be just or virtuous unless he believes in
some being infinitely superior to himself?If this doctrine be true, how
can God be just or virtuous?Does He believe in some being superior to
himself?If man were incapable of suffering, if man could not
feel pain, the word "conscience" never would have passed his lips.The
man who puts himself in the place of another, whose imagination has been
cultivated to the point of feeling the agonies suffered by another, is
the man of conscience.Black says, "We have neither jurisdiction or capacity to rejudge
the justice of God."In other words, we have no right to think upon
this subject, no right to examine the questions most vitally affecting
human-kind.We are simply to accept the ignorant statements of barbarian
dead.This question cannot be settled by saying that "it would be a
mere waste of time and space to enumerate the proofs which show that the
universe was created by a pre-existent and self-conscious being."The
time and space should have been "wasted," and the proofs should have
been enumerated.These "proofs" are what the wisest and greatest are
trying to find.It cares nothing
for the opinions of the "great," nothing for the prejudices of the many,
and least of all, for the superstitions of the dead.In the world of
science--a fact is a legal tender.Assertions and miracles are base and
spurious coins.We have the right to rejudge the justice even of a god.No one should throw away his reason--the fruit of all experience.It is
the intellectual capital of the soul, the only light, the only guide,
and without it the brain becomes the palace of an idiot king, attended
by a retinue of thieves and hypocrites.The Liberty of the Bible

This is the religious liberty of the Bible.If you had lived in
Palestine, and if the wife of your bosom, dearer to you than your
own soul, had said: "I like the religion of India better than that of
Palestine," it would have been your duty to kill her."Your eye must not
pity her, your hand must be first upon her, and afterwards the hand of
all the people."If she had said: "Let us worship the sun--the sun that
clothes the earth in garments of green--the sun, the great fireside of
the world--the sun that covers the hills and valleys with flowers--that
gave me your face, and made it possible for me to look into the eyes
of my babe,--let us worship the sun," it was your duty to kill her.You
must throw the first stone, and when against her bosom--a bosom filled
with love for you--you had thrown the jagged and cruel rock, and had
seen the red stream of her life oozing from the dumb lips of death,
you could then look up and receive the congratulations of the God whose
commandment you had obeyed.Is it possible that a being of infinite
mercy ordered a husband to kill his wife for the crime of having
expressed, an opinion on the subject of religion?Has there been found
upon the records of the savage world anything more perfectly fiendish
than this commandment of Jehovah?This is justified on the ground that
"blasphemy was a breach of political allegiance, and idolatry an act of
overt treason."We can understand how a human king stands in need of the
service of his people.We can understand how the desertion of any of
his soldiers weakens his army; but were the king infinite in power,
his strength would still remain the same, and under no conceivable
circumstances could the enemy triumph.Slavery in Heaven

According to Mr.Black, there will be slavery in Heaven, and fast by
the throne of God will be the auction-block, and the streets of the New
Jerusalem will be adorned with the whipping-post, while the music of
the harp will be supplemented by the crack of the driver's whip.Black, "incorporate him into his family,
tame him, teach him to think, and give him a knowledge of the true
principles of human liberty and government, he would confer upon him a
most beneficent boon."Black is too late with his protest against
the freedom of his fellow-men.Liberty is making the tour of the world.Russia has emancipated her serfs; the slave trade is prosecuted only
by thieves and pirates; Spain feels upon her cheek the burning blush
of shame; Brazil, with proud and happy eyes, is looking for the dawn of
freedom's day; the people of the South rejoice that slavery is no more,
and every good and honest man (excepting Mr.Black) of every land and
clime hopes that the limbs of men will never feel again the weary weight
of chains.Jehovah Breaking His Own Laws

A very curious thing about these Commandments is that their supposed
author violated nearly every one.From Sinai, according to the account,
He said: "Thou shalt not kill," and yet He ordered the murder of
millions; "Thou shalt not commit adultery," and He gave captured maidens
to gratify the lust of captors; "Thou shalt not steal," and yet He gave
to Jewish marauders the flocks and herds of others; "Thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's house, nor his wife," and yet He allowed His chosen
people to destroy the homes of neighbors and to steal their wives;
"Honor thy father and mother," and yet this same God had thousands of
fathers butchered, and with the sword of war killed children yet unborn;
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," and yet
He sent abroad "lying spirits" to deceive His own prophets, and in a
hundred ways paid tribute to deceit.So far as we know, Jehovah kept
only one of these Commandments--He worshiped no other god.I know as little as anyone else about the "pla" of the universe; and as
to the "design," I know just as little.It will not do to say that the
universe was designed, and therefore there must be a designer.There
must first be proof that it was "designed."It will not do to say that
the universe has a "plan," and then assert that there must have been an
infinite maker.The idea that a design must have a beginning, and that a
designer need not, is a simple expression of human ignorance.We find
a watch, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a thing must have had a
maker."We find the watchmaker, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a
thing as man must have had a maker."We find God and we then say: "He is
so wonderful that he must _not_ have had a maker."In other words, all
things a little wonderful must have been created, but it is possible for
something to be so wonderful that it always existed.One would suppose
that just as the wonder increased the necessity for a creator increased,
because it is the wonder of the thing that suggests the idea of
creation.Is it possible that a designer exists from all eternity
without design?Was there no design in having an infinite designer?For
me, it is hard to see the plan or design in earthquakes and pestilences.It is somewhat difficult to discern the design or the benevolence in so
making the world that billions of animals live only on the agonies of
others.The justice of God is not visible to me in the history of this
world.When I think of the suffering and death, of the poverty and
crime, of the cruelty and malice, of the heartlessness of this "design"
and "plan," where beak and claw and tooth tear and rend the quivering
flesh of weakness and despair, I cannot convince myself that it is the
result of infinite wisdom, benevolence, and justice.What we Know of the Infinite

Of course, upon a question like this, nothing can be absolutely known.We live on an atom called Earth, and what we know of the infinite is
almost infinitely limited; but, little as we know, all have an equal
right to give their honest thought.Life is a shadowy, strange,
and winding road on which we travel for a little way--a few short
steps--just from the cradle, with its lullaby of love, to the low and
quiet wayside inn, where all at last must sleep, and where the only
salutation is--Good-night.The Universe Self-Existent

The universe, according to my idea, is, always was, and forever will
be.It did not "come into being;" it is the one eternal being--the only
thing that ever did, does, or can exist.We know nothing of what we call the laws of Nature except as we gather
the idea of law from the uniformity of phenomena springing from like
conditions.To make myself clear: Water always runs down hill.The
theist says that this happens because there is behind the phenomenon an
active law.As a matter of fact law is this side of the phenomenon.Law
does not cause the phenomenon, but the phenomenon causes the idea of law
in our minds, and this idea is produced from the fact that under like
circumstances the same phenomena always happens.Black probably
thinks that the difference in the weight of rocks and clouds was created
by law; that parallel lines fail to imite only because it is illegal;
that diameter and circumference could have been so made that it would
be a greater distance across than around a circle, that a straight line
could inclose a triangle if not prevented by law, and that a little
legislation could make it possible for two bodies to occupy the same
space at the same time.It seems to me that law can not be the cause of
phenomena, but it is an effect produced in our minds by their succession
and resemblance.To put a God back of the universe compels us to admit
that there was a time when nothing existed except this God; that this
God had lived from eternity in an infinite vacuum and in an absolute
idleness.The mind of every thoughtful man is forced to one of these two
conclusions, either that the universe is self-existent or that it
was created by a self-existent being.To my mied there are far more
difficulties in the second hypothesis than in the first.Jehovah's Promise Broken

If Jehovah was in fact God, He knew the end from the beginning.He knew
that his Bible would be a breastwork behind which tyranny and hypocrisy
would crouch; that it would be quoted by tyrants; that it would be the
defense of robbers called kings and of hypocrites called priests.He
knew that He had taught the Jewish people but little of importance.He
knew that He found them free and left them captives.He knew that He
had never fulfilled the promises made to them.He knew that while other
nations had advanced in art and science his chosen people were savage
still.He promised them the world, and gave them a desert.He promised
them liberty, and He made them slaves.He promised them victory, and He
gave them defeat.He said they should be kings, and He made them
serfs.He promised them universal empire, and gave them exile.When one
finishes the Old Testament, he is compelled to say: Nothing can add to
the misery of a nation whose King is Jehovah!Character Bather than Creed

For a thousand years the torch of progress was extinguished in the blood
of Christ, and His disciples, moved by ignorant zeal, by insane, cruel
creeds, destroyed with flame and sword a hundred millions of their
fellow-men.But if cathedrals had been
universities--if dungeons of the Inquisition had been laboratories--if
Christians had believed in character instead of creed--if they had taken
from the Bible all the good and thrown away the wicked and absurd--if
domes of temples had been observatories--if priests had been
philosophers--if missionaries had taught the useful arts--if astrology
had been astronomy--if the black art had been chemistry--if superstition
had been science--if religion had been humanity--it would have been a
heaven filled with love, with liberty, and joy.Mohammed the Prophet of God

Mohammed was a poor man, a driver of camels.He was without education,
without influence, and without wealth, and yet in a few years he
consolidated thousands of tribes, and millions of men confess that there
is "one God, and Mohammed is his prophet."His success was a thousand
times greater during his life than that of Christ.He was not crucified;
he was a conqueror."Of all men, he exercised the greatest influence
upon the human race."Never in the world's history did a religion
spread with the rapidity of his.It burst like a storm over the fairest
portions of the globe.Black is right in his position that
rapidity is secured only by the direct aid of the Divine Being,
then Mohammed was most certainly the prophet of God.As to wars of
extermination and slavery, Mohammed agreed with Mr.Black, and upon
polygamy with Jehovah.As to religious toleration, he was great enough
to say that "men holding to any form of faith might be saved, provided
they were virtuous."In this he was far in advance both of Jehovah and
Mr.Wanted!--A Little More Legislation

We are informed by Mr.Black that "polygamy is neither commanded or
prohibited in the Old Testament--that it is only discouraged."It seems
to me that a little legislation on that subject might have tended to its
"discouragement."Black assures us "consists of certain immutable rules to govern the
conduct of all men at all times and at all places in their private and
personal relations with others," not one word is found on the subject of
polygamy.There is nothing "discouraging" in the Ten Commandments, nor
in the records of any conversation Jehovah is claimed to have had with
Moses upon Sinai.The life of Abraham, the story of Jacob and Laban,
the duty of a brother to be the husband of the widow of his deceased
brother, the life of David, taken in connection with the practice of
one who is claimed to have been the wisest of men--all these things are
probably relied on to show that polygamy was at least "discouraged."Certainly Jehovah had time to instruct Moses as to the infamy of
polygamy.He could have spared a few moments from a description of
patterns of tongs and basins for a subject so important as this.A
few-words in favor of the one wife and one husband--in favor of the
virtuous and loving home--might have taken the place of instructions
as to cutting the garments of priests and fashioning candlesticks and
ounces of gold.If he had left out simply the order that rams' skins
should be dyed red, and in its place had said, "A man shall have but one
wife, and the wife but one husband," how much better it would have been.Again, it is urged that "the acceptance of Christianity by a large
portion of the generation contemporary with its Founder and His
Apostles, was under the circumstances, an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."If this is true,
then "the acceptance of Buddhism by a large portion of the generation
contemporary with its Founder was an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."The same could
be said of Mohammedanism, and, in fact, of every religion that has
ever benefited or cursed this world.This argument, when reduced to its
simplest form, is this: All that succeeds is inspired.The Morality in Christianity

The morality in Christianity has never opposed the freedom of thought.It has never put, nor tended to put, a chain on a human mind, nor a
manacle on a human limb; but the doctrines distinctively Christian--the
necessity of believing a certain thing; the idea that eternal punishment
awaited him who failed to believe; the idea that the innocent can suffer
for the guilty--these things have |opposed, and for a thousand years
substantially destroyed the freedom of the human mind.All religions
have, with ceremony, magic, and mystery, deformed, darkened, and
corrupted, the soul.Around the sturdy oaks of morality have grown and
clung the parasitic, poisonous vines of the miraculous and monstrous.Irenaeus assures us that all Christians possessed the power of
working miracles; that they prophesied, cast out devils, healed the
sick, and even raised the dead.Epiphanius asserts that some rivers
and fountains were annually transmuted into wine, in attestation of the
miracle of Cana, adding that he himself had drunk of these fountains.Augustine declares that one was told in a dream where the bones of
St.Stephen were buried and the bones were thus discovered and brought
to Hippo, and that they raised five dead persons to life, and that in
two years seventy miracles were performed with these relics.Justin
Martyr states that God once sent some angels to guard the human race,
that these angels fell in love with the daughters of men, and became the
fathers of innumerable devils.For hundreds of years miracles were
about the only things that happened.They were wrought by thousands of
Christians, and testified to by millions.The saints and martyrs, the
best and greatest, were the witnesses and workers of wonders.Even
heretics, with the assistance of the devil, could suspend the "laws
of nature."Must we believe these wonderful accounts because they were
written by "good men," by Christians," who made their statements in the
presence and expectation of death"?The truth is that these "good men"
were mistaken.They fed their minds on prodigies, and their imaginations
feasted on effects without causes.Doubts were regarded as "rude disturbers of the congregation."Credulity
and sanctity walked hand in hand.As the philosophy of the ancients was rendered almost worthless by the
credulity of the common people, so the proverbs of Christ, his religion
of forgiveness, his creed of kindness, were lost in the mist of miracle
and the darkness of superstition.The Honor Due to Christ

For the man Christ--for the reformer who loved his fellow-men--for the
man who believed in an Infinite Father, who would shield the innocent
and protect the just--for the martyr who expected to be rescued from the
cruel cross, and who at last, finding that his rope was dust, cried out
in the gathering gloom of death; "My God!--for that great and suffering man, mistaken though he was, I have
the highest admiration and respect.That man did not, as I believe,
claim a miraculous origin; he did not pretend to heal the sick nor raise
the dead.He claimed simply to be a man, and taught his fellow-men
that love is stronger far than hate.His life was written by reverent
ignorance.Loving credulity belittled his career with feats of jugglery
and magic art, and priests wishing to persecute and slay, put in his
mouth the words of hatred and revenge.The theological Christ is the
impossible union of the human and divine--man with the attributes of
God, and God with the limitations and weakness of man.Christianity has no Monopoly in Morals

The morality of the world is not distinctively Christian.Zoroaster,
Gautama, Mohammed, Confucius, Christ, and, in fact, all founders of
religions, have said to their disciples: You must not steal; You must
not murder; You must not bear false witness; You must discharge your
obligations.Christianity is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the
miraculous origin of Jesus Christ, his crucifixion, his resurrection,
his ascension, the inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the
atonement, and the necessity of belief.Buddhism is the ordinary moral
code, _plus_ the miraculous illumination of Buddha, the performance of
certain ceremonies, a belief in the transmigration of the soul, and
in the final absorption of the human by the infinite.The religion of
Mohammed is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the belief that Mohammed
was the prophet of God, total abstinence from the use of intoxicating
drinks, a harem for the faithful here and hereafter, ablutions, prayers,
alms, pilgrimages, and fasts.Old Age in Superstition's Lap

And here I take occasion to thank Mr.Black for having admitted that
Jehovah gave no commandment against the practice of polygamy, that he
established slavery, waged wars of extermination, and persecuted for
opinions' sake even unto death, Most theologians endeavor to putty,
patch, and paint the wretched record of inspired crime, but Mr.Black
has been bold enough and honest enough to admit the truth.In this age
of fact and demonstration it is refreshing to find a man who believes
so thoroughly in the monstrous and miraculous, the impossible and
immoral--who still clings lovingly to the legends of the bib and
rattle--who through the bitter experiences of a wicked world has kept
the credulity of the cradle, and finds comfort and joy in thinking about
the Garden of Eden, the subtile serpent, the flood, and Babel's tower,
stopped by the jargon of a thousand tongues--who reads with happy eyes
the story of the burning brimstone storm that fell upon the cities
of the plain, and smilingly explains the transformation of the
retrospective Mrs.Lot--who laughs at Egypt's plagues and Pharaoh's
whelmed and drowning hosts--eats manna with the wandering Jews, warms
himself at the burning bush, sees Korah's company by the hungry earth
devoured, claps his wrinkled hands with glee above the heathens'
butchered babes, and longingly looks back to the patriarchal days of
concubines and slaves.How touching when the learned and wise crawl back
in cribs and ask to hear the rhymes and fables once again!How charming
in these hard and scientific times to see old age in Superstition's lap,
with eager lips upon her withered breast!Ararat in Chicago

A little while ago, in the city of Chicago, a gentleman addressed a
number of Sunday-school children.In his address he stated that some
people were wicked enough to deny the story of the deluge; that he was
a traveler; that he had been to the top of Mount Ararat, and had brought
with him a stone from that sacred locality.The children were then
invited to form in procession and walk by the pulpit, for the purpose of
seeing this wonderful stone.After they had looked at it, the lecturer
said: "Now, children, if you ever hear anybody deny the story of the
deluge, or say that the ark did not rest on Mount Ararat, you can tell
them that you know better, because you have seen with your own eyes a
stone from that very mountain."How Gods and Devils are Made

It was supposed that God demanded worship; that he loved to be
flattered; that he delighted in sacrifice; that nothing made him happier
than to see ignorant faith upon its knees; that above all things he
hated and despised doubters and heretics, and regarded investigation as
rebellion.Each community felt it a duty to see that the enemies of God
were converted or killed.To allow a heretic to live in peace was
to invite the wrath of God.Every public evil--every misfortune--was
accounted for by something the community had permitted or done.When
epidemics appeared, brought by ignorance and welcomed by filth, the
heretic was brought out and sacrificed to appease the anger of God.By putting intention behind what man called good, God was produced.By
putting intention behind what man called bad, the Devil was created.Leave this "intention" out, and gods and devils fade away.If not a
human being existed, the sun would continue to shine, and tempest now
and then would devastate the earth; the rain would fall in pleasant
showers; violets would spread their velvet bosoms to the sun, the
earthquake would devour, birds would sing, and daisies bloom, and
roses blush, and volcanoes fill the heavens with their lurid glare; the
procession of the seasons would not be broken, and the stars would shine
as serenely as though the world were filled with loving hearts and happy
homes.The Romance of Figures

How long, according to the universal benevolence of the New Testament,
can a man be reasonably punished in the next world for failing to
believe something unreasonable in this?Can it be possible that any
punishment can endure forever?Suppose that every flake of snow that
ever fell was a figure nine, and that the first flake was multiplied by
the second, and that product by the third, and so on to the last flake.And then suppose that this total should be multiplied by every drop of
rain that ever fell, calling each drop a figure nine; and that total by
each blade of grass that ever helped to weave a carpet for the earth,
calling each blade a figure nine; and that again by every grain of sand
on every shore, so that the grand total would make a line of nines so
long that it would require millions upon millions of years for light,
traveling at the rate of one hundred and eighty-five thousand miles per
second, to reach the end.And suppose, further, that each unit in this
almost infinite total, stood for billions of ages--still that vast and
almost endless time, measured by all the years beyond, is as one flake,
one drop, one leaf, one blade, one grain, compared with all the flakes,
and drops, and leaves, and blades and grains.Upon love's breast the
Church has placed the eternal asp.And yet, in the same book in which is
taught this most infamous of doctrines, we are assured that "The Lord is
good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works."God and Zeno

If the Bible is inspired, Jehovah, God of all worlds, actually said:
"And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under
his hand, he shall be surely punished; notwithstanding, if he continue
a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money."And yet
Zeno, founder of the Stoics, centuries before Christ was born, insisted
that no man could be the owner of another, and that the title was bad,
whether the slave had become so by conquest, or by purchase.Jehovah,
ordered a Jewish general to make war, and gave, among others, this
command: "When the Lord thy God shall drive them before thee, thou shalt
smite them and utterly destroy them."And yet Epictetus, whom we have
already quoted, gave this marvelous rule for the guidance of human
conduct: "Live with thy inferiors as thou wouldst have thy superiors
live with thee."If Christ was in fact God, he knew all the future.Before him, like a
panorama, moved the history yet to be.He knew exactly how his words
would be interpreted.He knew what crimes, what horrors, what infamies,
would be committed in his name.He knew that the fires of persecution
would climb around the limbs of countless martyrs.He knew that brave
men would languish in dungeons, in darkness, filled with pain; that the
church would use instruments of torture, that his followers would appeal
to whip and chain.He must have seen the horizon of the future red with
the flames of the _auto da fe_.He knew all the creeds that would spring
like poison fungi from every text.He saw the sects waging war against
each other.He saw thousands of men, under the orders of priests,
building dungeons for their fellow-men.He heard the groans, saw the faces white with agony, the tears,
the blood--heard the shrieks and sobs of all the moaning, martyred
multitudes.He knew that commentaries would be written on his words with
swords, to be read by the light of fagots.He knew that the Inquisition
would be born of teachings attributed to him.He saw all the
interpolations and falsehoods that hypocrisy would write and tell.He
knew that above these fields of death, these dungeons, these burnings,
for a thousand years would float the dripping banner of the cross.He
knew that in his name his followers would trade in human flesh, that
cradles would be robbed and women's breasts unbabed for gold;--and yet
he died with voiceless lips.Why did he not
tell his disciples, and through them the world, that man should not
persecute, for opinion's sake, his fellow-man?Why did he not cry, You
shall not persecute in my name; you shall not burn and torment those who
differ from you in creed?Why did he not plainly say, I am the Son of
God?Why did he not explain the doctrine of the trinity?Why did he not
tell the manner of baptism that was pleasing to him?Why did he not say
something positive, definite, and satisfactory about another world?Why
did he not turn the tear-stained hope of heaven to the glad knowledge
of another life?Why did he go dumbly to his death, leaving the world to
misery and to doubt?The Philosophy of Action

Consequences determine the quality of an action.If consequences are
good, so is the action.If actions had no consequences, they would be
neither good nor bad.Man did not get his knowledge of the consequences
of actions from God, but from experience and reason.If man can, by
actual experiment, discover the right and wrong of actions, is it not
utterly illogical to declare that they who do not believe in God can
have no standard of right and wrong?Consequences are the standard by
which actions are judged.They are the children that testify as to the
real character of their parents.God or no God, larceny is the enemy of
industry--industry is the mother of prosperity--prosperity is a good,
and therefore larceny is an evil.God or no God, murder is a crime.There has always been a law against larceny, because the laborer wishes
to enjoy the fruit of his toil.As long as men object to being killed,
murder will be illegal.I have insisted, and I still insist, that it is still impossible for
a finite man to commit a crime deserving infinite punishment; and upon
this subject Mr.Black admits that "no revelation has lifted the veil
between time and eternity;" and, consequently, neither the priest nor
the "policeman" knows anything with certainty regarding another world.He simply insists that "in shadowy figures we are warned that a very
marked distinction will be made between the good and bad in the next
world."There is "a very marked distinction" in this; but there is this
rainbow in the darkest human cloud: The worst have hope of reform.All I
insist is, if there is another life, the basest soul that finds its way
to that dark or radiant shore will have the everlasting chance of
doing right.Nothing but the most cruel ignorance, the most heartless
superstition, the most ignorant theology, ever imagined that the
few days of human life spent here, surrounded by mists and clouds of
darkness, blown over life's sea by storms and tempests of passion, fixed
for all eternity the condition of the human race.If this doctrine be
true, this life is but a net, in which Jehovah catches souls for hell.We are told that "there is no good reason to doubt that the statements
of the Evangelists, as we have them now, are genuine."The fact is, no
one knows who made the "statements of the Evangelists."There are three
important manuscripts upon which the Christian world relies."The first
appeared in the catalogue of the Vatican, in 1475.Of the New, it contains the four gospels,--the Acts, the
seven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the
Epistle to the Hebrews, so far as the fourteenth verse of the ninth
chapter,"--and nothing more."The
second, the Alexandrine, was presented to King Charles the First, in
1628.It contains the Old and New Testaments, with some exceptions;
passages are wanting in Matthew, in John, and in II.It
also contains the Epistle of Clemens Romanus, a letter of Athanasius,
and the treatise of Eusebius on the Psalms."The last is the Sinaitic
Codex, discovered about 1850, at the Convent of St."It contains the Old and New Testaments, and in addition
the entire Epistle of Barnabas, and a portion of the Shepherd of
Hennas--two books which, up to the beginning of the fourth century, were
looked upon by many as Scripture."In this manuscript, or codex, the
gospel of St.Mark concludes with the eighth verse of the sixteenth
chapter, leaving out the frightful passage: "Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature.He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."In
matters of the utmost importance these manuscripts disagree, but even if
they all agreed it would not furnish the slightest evidence of their
truth.It will not do to call the statements made in the gospels
"depositions," until it is absolutely established who made them, and the
circumstances under which they were made.Neither can we say that "they
were made in the immediate prospect of death," until we know who made
them.It is absurd to say that "the witnesses could not have been
mistaken, because the nature of the facts precluded the possibility of
any delusion about them."Can it be pretended that the witnesses could
not have been mistaken about the relation the Holy Ghost is alleged to
have sustained to Jesus Christ?Is there no possibility of delusion
about a circumstance of that kind?Did the writers of the four gospels
have "the sensible and true avouch of their own eyes and ears" in that
behalf?How was it possible for any one of the four Evangelists to know
that Christ was the Son of God, or that he was God?Matthew says that an angel of the Lord told
Joseph in a dream, but Joseph never wrote an account of this wonderful
vision.Luke tells us that the angel had a conversation with Mary, and
that Mary told Elizabeth, but Elizabeth never wrote a word.There is no
account of Mary, or Joseph, or Elizabeth, or the angel, having had any
conversation with Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, in which one word was
said about the miraculous origin of Jesus Christ.The persons who knew
did not write, so that the account is nothing but hearsay.Black pretend that such statements would be admitted as evidence in any
court?But how do we know that the disciples of Christ wrote a word of
the gospels?How do we know
that the writers of the gospels "were men of unimpeachable character?"Black's Admission

For the purpose of defending the character of his infallible God, Mr.Black is forced to defend religious intolerance, wars of extermination,
human slavery, and almost polygamy.He admits that God established
slavery; that he commanded his chosen people to buy the children of the
heathen; that heathen fathers and mothers did right to sell their girls
and boys; that God ordered the Jews to wage wars of extermination and
conquest; that it was right to kill the old and young; that God forged
manacles for the human brain; that he commanded husbands to murder their
wives for suggesting the worship of the sun or moon; and that every
cruel, savage passage in the Old Testament was inspired by him.Such is
a "policeman's" view of God.The Stars Upon the Door of France

Mr.Black justifies all the crimes and horrors, excuses all the tortures
of all the Christian years, by denouncing the cruelties of the French
Revolution.Thinking people will not hasten to admit that an infinitely
good being authorized slavery in Judea, because of the atrocities of the
French Revolution.They will remember the sufferings of the Huguenots.They will not forget
the countless cruelties of priest and king.They will not forget the
dungeons of the Bastile.They will know that the Revolution was an
effect, and that liberty was not the cause--that atheism was not the
cause.Behind the Revolution they will see altar and throne--sword and
fagot--palace and cathedral--king and priest--master and slave--tyrant
and hypocrite.They will see that the excesses, the cruelties, and
crimes were but the natural fruit of seeds the church had sown.Upon that cloud of war, black with
the myriad miseries of a thousand years, dabbled with blood of king and
queen, of patriot and priest, there was this bow: "Beneath the flag of
France all men are free."In spite of all the blood and crime, in spite
of deeds that seem insanely base, the People placed upon a Nation's brow
these stars:--Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--grander words than ever
issued from Jehovah's lips.A KIND WORD FOR JOHN CHINAMAN

On the 27th day of March, 1880, Messrs.Wright, Dickey, O'Conner, and
Murch, of the Select Committee appointed by Congress to "Consider
the causes of the present depression of labor," presented the majority
special report on Chinese Immigration.The following quotations are
excerpts from Col.R. G. Ingersoll's caustic review of that report.The Select Committee Afraid

These gentlemen are in great fear for the future of our most holy and
perfectly authenticated religion, and have, like faithful watchmen,
from the walls and towers of Zion, hastened to give the alarm.They have
informed Congress that "Joss has his temple of worship in the Chinese
quarters, in San Francisco.Within the walls of a dilapidated structure
is exposed to the view of the faithful the God of the Chinaman, and here
are his altars of worship, Here he tears up his pieces of paper; here he
offers up his prayers; here he receives his religious consolations,
and here is his road to the celestial land."That "Joss is located in a
long, narrow room, in a building in a back alley, upon a kind of altar;"
that "he is a wooden image, looking as much like an alligator as like a
human being;" that the Chinese "think there is such a place as heaven;"
that "all classes of Chinamen worship idols;" that "the temple is open
every day at all hours;" that "the Chinese have no Sunday;" that this
heathen god has "huge jaws, a big red tongue, large white teeth, a half
dozen arms, and big, fiery, eyeballs.About him are placed offerings of
meat, and other eatables--a sacrificial offering."The Gods of the Joss-House and Patmos

No wonder that these members of the committee were shocked at such a
god, knowing as they did, that the only true God was correctly described
by the inspired lunatic of Patmos in the following words: "And there sat
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of
Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps
with a golden girdle.His head and his hairs were white like wool, as
white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like
unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the
sound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out
of his mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword; and his countenance was as
the sun shining in his strength."Certainly, a large mouth, filled
with white teeth, is preferable to one used as the scabbard of a sharp,
two-edged sword.Why should these gentlemen object to a god with big
fiery eyeballs, when their own Deity has eyes like a flame of fire?A Little Too Late

Is it not a little late in the day to object to people because they
sacrifice meat and other eatables to their god?We all know, that for
thousands of years the "real" God was exceedingly fond of roasted meat;
that He loved the savor of burning flesh, and delighted in the perfume
of fresh warm blood.Christianity has a Fair Show in San Francisco

The world is also informed by these gentlemen that "the idolatry of
the Chinese produces a demoralizing effect upon our American youth by
bringing sacred things into disrespect and making religion a theme of
disgust and contempt."In San Francisco there are some three hundred
thousand people.Is it possible that a few Chinese can bring "our holy
religion" into disgust and contempt?In that city there are fifty times
as many churches as joss-houses.Scores of sermons are uttered every
week; religious books and papers are plentiful as leaves in autumn, and
somewhat dryer; thousands of bibles are within the reach of all.An Arrow from the Quiver of Satire

And there, too, is the example of a Christian city.Why should we send
missionaries to China, if we cannot convert the heathen when they come
here?When missionaries go to a foreign land the poor benighted people
have to take their word for the blessings showered upon a Christian
people; but when the heathen come here, they can see for themselves.What was simply a story becomes a demonstrated fact.They come in
contact with people who love their enemies.They see that in a Christian
land men tell the truth; that they will not take advantage of strangers;
that they are just and patient; kind and tender; and have no prejudice
on account of color, race or religion; that they look upon mankind as
brethren; that they speak of God as a Universal Father, and are
willing to work and even to suffer, for the good, not only of their own
countrymen, but of the heathen as well.All this the Chinese see and
know, and why they still cling to the religion of their country is, to
me, a matter of amazement.We Have no Religious System

I take this, the earliest opportunity, to inform these gentlemen
composing a majority of the committee, that we have in the United States
no "religious system;" that this is a secular government.That it has
no religious creed; that it does not believe nor disbelieve in a future
state of reward or punishment; that it neither affirms nor denies the
existence of a "living" God.Congress Nothing to Do with Religion

Congress has nothing to do with the religion of the people.Its members
are not responsible to God for the opinions of their constituents, and
it may tend to the happiness of the constituents for me to state that
they are in no way responsible for the religion of the members.Religion
is an individual, not a national matter.And where the nation interferes
with the right of conscience, the liberties of the people are devoured
by the monster Superstition.But I am astonished that four Christian statesmen, four members of
Congress in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, who seriously
object to people on account of their religious convictions, should
still assert that the very religion in which they believe--and the only
religion established by the living god-head of the American system--is
not adapted to the spiritual needs of one-third of the human race.It is
amazing that these four gentlemen have, in the defense of the Christian
religion, announced the discovery that it is wholly inadequate for
the civilization of mankind; that the light of the cross can never
penetrate the darkness of China; "that all the labors of the missionary,
the example of the good, the exalted character of our civilization, make
no impression upon the pagan life of the Chinese;" and that even
the report of this committee will not tend to elevate, refine and
Christianize the yellow heathen of the Pacific coast.In the name
of religion these gentlemen have denied its power and mocked at the
enthusiasm of its founder.Worse than this, they have predicted for the
Chinese a future of ignorance and idolatry in this world, and, if the
"American system" of religion is true, hell-fire in the next.Do not Trample on John Chinaman

Do not trample upon these people because they have a different
conception of things about which even this committee knows nothing.Give them the same privilege you enjoy of making a God after their own
fashion.Would you be willing
to have them remain, if one of their race, thousands of years ago, had
pretended to have seen God, and had written of him as follows: "There
went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth; coals
were kindled by it, * * * and he rode upon a cherub and did fly."Why
should you object to these people on account of their religion?Your
objection has in it the spirit of hate and intolerance.That spirit lighted the fagot, made the
thumb-screw, put chains upon the limbs, and lashes upon the backs of
men.The same spirit bought and sold, captured and kidnapped human
beings; sold babes, and justified all the horrors of slavery.Be Honest with the Chinese

If you wish to drive out the Chinese, do not make a pretext of religion.Do not pretend that you are trying to do God a favor.Injustice in his
name is doubly detestable.The assassin cannot sanctify his dagger by
falling on his knees, and it does not help a falsehood if it be uttered
as a prayer.Religion, used, to intensify the hatred of men toward men,
under the pretense of pleasing God, has cursed this world.An Honest Merchant the Best Missionary

I am almost sure that I have read somewhere that "Christ died for _all_
men," and that "God is no respecter of persons."It was once taught
that it was the duty of Christians to tell to all people the "tidings of
great joy."I have never believed these things myself, but have always
contended that an honest merchant was the best missionary.Commerce
makes friends, religion makes enemies; the one enriches, and the other
impoverishes; the one thrives best where the truth is told, the other
where falsehoods are believed.For myself, I have but little confidence
in any business, or enterprise, or investment, that promises dividends
only after the death of the stockholders.Good Words from Confucius

For the benefit of these four philosophers and prophets, I will give a
few extracts from the writings of Confucius that will, in my judgment,
compare favorably with the best passages of their report:

"My doctrine is that man must be true to the principles of his nature,
and the benevolent exercises of them toward others.""With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and with my bended arm
for a pillow, I still have joy.""Riches and honor acquired by injustice are to me but floating clouds.""The man who, in view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who, in view of
danger, forgets life; and who remembers an old agreement, however far
back it extends, such a man may be reckoned a complete man.""Recompense injury with justice, and kindness with kindness."There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's
life: Reciprocity is that word.The Ancient Chinese

When the ancestors of the four Christian Congressmen were barbarians,
when they lived in caves, gnawed bones, and worshiped dry snakes; the
infamous Chinese were reading these sublime sentences of Confucius.When
the forefathers of these Christian statesmen were hunting toads to
get the jewels out of their heads to be used as charms, the wretched
Chinamen were calculating eclipses, and measuring the circumference
of the earth.When the progenitors of these representatives of the
"American system of religion" were burning women charged with nursing
devils, these people "incapable of being influenced by the exalted
character of our civilization," were building asylums for the insane.The Chinese and Civil Service Reform

Neither should it be forgotten that, for thousands of years, the Chinese
have honestly practised the great principle known as civil service
reform--a something that even the administration of Mr.Hayes has
reached only through the proxy of promise.Invading China in the Name of Opium and Christ

The English battered down the door of China in the names of Opium and
Christ.This infamy was regarded as another triumph of the gospel.At last in self-defense the Chinese allowed Christians to touch their
shores.Their wise men, their philosophers, protested, and prophesied
that time would show that Christians could not be trusted.This re port
proves that the wise men were not only philosophers but prophets.Don't be Dishonest in the Name of God

Treat China as you would England.Change it if you will, according to the laws of nations, but on no
account excuse a breach of national faith by pretending that we are
dishonest for God's sake.CONCERNING CREEDS AND THE TYRANNY OF SECTS




482.Diversity of Opinion Abolished by Henry VIII

In the reign of Henry VIII--that pious and moral founder of the
apostolic Episcopal Church,--there was passed by the parliament
of England an act entitled, "An act for abolishing of diversity of
opinion."And in this act was set forth what a good Christian was
obliged to believe:

First, That in the sacrament was the real body and blood of Jesus
Christ.Second, That the body and blood of Jesus Christ was in the bread, and
the blood and body of Jesus Christ was in the wine.Fourth, That vows of chastity were of perpetual obligation.Fifth, That private masses ought to be continued; and,

Sixth, That auricular confession to a priest must be maintained.This creed was made by law, in order that all men might know just what
to believe by simply reading the statute.The Church hated to see the
people wearing out their brains in thinking upon these subjects.Spencer and Darwin Damned

According to the philosophy of theology, man has continued to degenerate
for six thousand years.To teach that there is that in nature which
impels to higher forms and grander ends, is heresy, of course.The
Deity will damn Spencer and his "Evolution," Darwin and his "Origin
of Species," Bastian and his "Spontaneous Generation," Huxley and his
"Protoplasm," Tyndall and his "Prayer Gauge," and will save those, and
those only, who declare that the universe has been cursed, from the
smallest atom to the grandest star; that everything tends to evil and to
that only, and that the only perfect thing in nature is the Presbyterian
Confession of Faith.The Dead do Not Persecute

Imagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The
end that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are
orthodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated
church.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,
side by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this
difference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois

The supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that
an unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not
be allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have
been murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other
witnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He
was liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to
contribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges
who decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any
court.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption
of the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored
to chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot

Now and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,
and has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious
get together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most
prophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the
tree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students

Thousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various
Churches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate
the phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only
object, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may
learn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in
the dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus
trained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,
he is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly
impossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you
think the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it
wrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,
that most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of
fear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy

A trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in
the Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it
still thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined
to prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are
shambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that
the Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with
force.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be
bound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and
dungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening

Fortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon
the Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and
sciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,
succumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,
but by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a
relic of the past.The cry of "heresy" has been growing fainter and
fainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination
have ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of
infants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist "Hoist with his own Petard."A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a
piece of friendly advice."Although you may disbelieve the bible," said
he, "you ought not to say so."Do
you believe the bible," said I. He replied, "Most assuredly."To which
I retorted, "Your answer conveys no information to me.You may be
following your own advice.Of
course a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be
particular about telling the truth himself."The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity

What a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human
heart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and
great were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother
bears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of
the natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;
that for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to
heaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling
in the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy

Whoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be
guilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name
given by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of
the hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and
who, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of
intellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet
used in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian
era, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment
inflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This
effort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the
salvation of the soul.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as
certainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They
do not say, "we _think_ this is so," but "we _know_ this is so."They do
not appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They
keep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing
has been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the
authority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly
sin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation
of superstition has always horrified the Church.By some unaccountable
infatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense
importance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will
forever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts
or denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.To practice
justice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some
incomprehensible creed.You must say, "Once one is three, and three
times one is one."The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to
believe, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church
as a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago

One hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have
perished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in
England, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves
in the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their
ears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads
branded.The Despotism of Faith

The despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian
countries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time
the same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,
in Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the
world, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the
assumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware

And what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says
a heretic, "Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your
children cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I
will hunt you to the very portals of the grave."Calvin's Petrified Heart

Luther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor
of his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified
heart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly
declared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the
founders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous
tenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily
inconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion
as to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Common sense
belongs exclusively to no tongue.Logic is not confined to, nor has it
been buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is
translated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue
of Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: "O Jupiter!He then added: "Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven
again, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you
were prostrate."The Tail of a Lion

There is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the
tail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think
and act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they
join something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party
can act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to
pay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself
about the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept

The fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The
fall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began
to have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the
congregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories
themselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short
of irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside
world was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while
the church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress

Christianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human
race.Across the highway of progress it has always been building
breastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,
dogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered
together behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of
malice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into
a deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
crowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of
hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you
will not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to
smilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not
been found.The Real Eden is Beyond

Nations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy
becomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the
years sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are
behind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for
knowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,
it will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men

Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,
Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and
women.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All
other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
given up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS




507.On which of the six days was he
created?Is it possible that God would make a successful
rival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what
a snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced
woman.He knew that if the serpent
got into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive
them out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he
himself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be
good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman
was a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to
take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it
not possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these
fables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God
take him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam
and Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not
acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's
reputation.Questions About the Ark

How was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what
was done with the filth?How were some
portions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others
kept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their
respective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,
and they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things
must have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept
up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the
slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the
plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate
rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and
so sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon
their health.Of course, all the polar
bears did not go.It could be confounded only by the
destruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at
that time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain
presiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak
the words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch
the brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in
the machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the
language of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man
to be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in
the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take
myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a
holy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,
candlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,
at the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put
any of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,
the Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,
that whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off
from his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot
believe it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
are?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
earth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters
happen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of
others?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a
legal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an
altar?Were the
stealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and
eloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these
things; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who
will burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who
burns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the
investigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,
laugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase
or decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an
eternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has
not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
entitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat
this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG

I do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the
clouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,
soil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every
heretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast
out and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give
his individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really
valuable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or
State solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically
we are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect
minds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give
up your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory
of reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,
the ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:
"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of
man."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,
but after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of
men and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the
human heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only
justice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the
same as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been
wet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne
have leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated
to excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his
existence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the
conditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what
would have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen
is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all
religions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our
right to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his
intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this
sense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own
in which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all
the gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;
they have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think
a man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long
time.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike
ourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than
servile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt
to ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any
time, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from
human speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of
the Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too
much thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the
sword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition
Science has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality
enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one
who had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the
moon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church.""On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and
success.INGERSOLL'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE

     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother
     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs
     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our
     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish
     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would
do for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were
falling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest
point; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,
using his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that
kisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured
with the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour
of all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a
sunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther
shore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every
life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment
jeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep
and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but
in the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic
souls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to
tears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly
gave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully
discharged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand
times I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a
temple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only
good, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only
religion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;
and were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom
to his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet
flowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,
and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless
lips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the
return of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that
these dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,
to do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR

     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were
     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran
     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the
great struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the
music of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We
see thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see
the pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those
assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the
great army of freedom.Some are
walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they
adore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as
they lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing
babes that are asleep.Some are parting with
mothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,
and say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand
waves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,
keeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the
great cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the
fields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory
fields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand
guard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with
them in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are
with them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,
the life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them
pierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in
the whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech
can never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden
in the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man
bowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
governed by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the
strokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through
tangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the
sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
brutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner
of the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting
shell.Instead of
slaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches
the auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see
homes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want
and crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They
are at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag
they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the
tearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of
the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less
palace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In
the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of
death.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for
the living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by
vermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother
of all abominations, the devil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva

The Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought

Prejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the
home.I believe in truth, in
investigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and
intelligence.Among the latter
is the one here mentioned, which was simply called 'Forum,' so long as
it was the only one of its kind existing at Rome, and, indeed, after
that period, as in the present instance.At a later period of the
Republic, and under the Empire, when other 'fora,' for judicial
purposes, were erected, this Forum' was distinguished by the epithets
'vetus,' 'old,' or'magnum, 'great.'It was situate between the
Capitoline and Palatine hills, and was originally a swamp or marsh,
which was filled up hy Romulus or Tatius.It was chiefly used for
judicial proceedings, and is supposed to have been surrounded with
the hankers' shops or offices, 'argentaria.'Gladiatorial games were
occasionally held there, and sometimes prisoners of war, and faithless
legionary soldiers, were there put to death.A second 'Forum,' for
judicial purposes, was erected hy Julius Caesar, and was called hy his
name.It was adorned with a splendid temple of Venus Genitrix.A third
was built hy Augustus, and was called 'Forum Augusts' It was adorned
with a temple of Mars, and the statues of the most distinguished men
of the republic.Having suffered severely from fire, this Forum was
restored by the Emperor Hadrian.It is mentioned in the Fourth Book of
the Pontic Epistles, Ep.[Footnote 609: With regard to me.--Ver.He says that because he is
poor she makes excuses, and pretends that she is afraid of her husband
and those whom he has set to watch her.][Footnote 610: Of thy own inspiration.--Ver.Burmann remarks, that
the word 'opus' is especially applied to the sacred rites of the Gods;
literally 'the priest of thy rites.'][Footnote 611: The erected pile--Ver.Among the Romans the corpse
was burnt on a pile of wood, which was called 'pyra,' or 'rogus.'According to Servius, it was called by the former name before, and hy
the latter after, it was lighted, but this distinction is not observed
by the Latin writers.]It was in the form of an altar with four equal sides, but it varied in
height and the mode of decoration, according to the circumstances of the
deceased.On the pile the body was placed with the couch on which it had
been carried; and frankincense, ointments, locks of hair, and garlands,
were thrown upon it.Even ornaments, clothes, and dishes of food were
sometimes used for the same purpose.This was done not only by the
family of the deceased, but by such persons as joined the funeral
procession.][Footnote 612: The cruel boar.--Ver.He alludes to the death of
Adonis, by the tusk of a boar, which pierced his thigh.See the Tenth
Book of the Metamorphoses, l.[Footnote 613: We possess inspiration.--Ver.In the Sixth Book of
the Fasti, 1.'There is a Deity within us (Poets): under
his guidance we glow with inspiration; this poetic fervour contains the
impregnating.particles of the mind of the Divinity.'][Footnote 614: She lays her.--Ver.It must be remembered that,
whereas we personify Death as of the masculine gender; the Romans
represented the grim tyrant as being a female.It is a curious fact
that we find Death very rarely represented as a skeleton on the Roman
monuments.The skeleton of a child has, in one instance, been found
represented on one of the tombs of Pompeii.The head of a horse was
one of the most common modes of representing death, as it signified
departure.][Footnote 615: Ismarian Orpheus.--Ver.Apollo and the Muse Calliope
were the parents of Orpheus, who met with a cruel death.See the
beginning of the Eleventh Book of the Metamorphoses.]'Ælinon' was said to have been
the exclamation of Apollo, on the death of his son, the poet Linus.The
word is derived from the Greek, 'di Aivôç,' 'Alas!A certain
poetic measure was called by this name; but we learn from Athenaeus,
that it was not always confined to pathetic subjects.There appear to
have been two persons of the name of Linus.One was a Theban, the son of
Apollo, and the instructor of Orpheus and Hercules, while the other was
the son of an Argive princess, by Apollo, who, according to Statius, was
torn to pieces in his infancy by dogs.][Footnote 617: The son of Mæon.See the Note to the ninth
line of the Fifteenth Elegy of the First Book of the Amores.][Footnote 618: Slow web woven.--Ver.[Footnote 619: Nemesis, so Delia.--Ver.Nemesis and Delia were the
names of damsels whose charms were celebrated by Tibullus.][Footnote 620: Sacrifice avail thee.--Ver.He alludes to two lines
in the]

First Elegy of Tibullus.]'Quid tua nunc Isis mihi Delia?quid mihi prosunt]

Ilia tuâ toties sera repuisa manu.']What have I now to do, Delia, with your Isis?what avail me those sistra
so often shaken by your hand?'][Footnote 621: What lying apart.--Ver.During the festival of Isis,
all intercourse with men was forbidden to the female devotees.][Footnote 622: The yawning tomb.--Ver.The place where a person was
burnt was called 'bustum,' if he was afterwards buried on the same spot,
and 'ustrina,' or 'ustrinum,' if he was buried at a different place.See
the Notes to the Fasti, B. ii.[Footnote 623: The towers of Eryx--Ver.He alludes to Venus, who
had a splendid temple on Mount Eryx, in Sicily.][Footnote 624: The Phæacian land.--Ver.The Phæacians were the
ancient people of Corcyra, now the isle of Corfu.Tibullus had attended
Messala thither, and falling ill, was unable to accompany his patron on
his return to Rome, on which he addressed to him the First Elegy of his
Third Book, in which he expressed a hope that he might not die among
the Phæacians.Tibullus afterwards
recovered, and died at Rome.When he penned this line, Ovid little
thought that his own bones would one day rest in a much more ignoble
spot than Corcyra, and one much more repulsive to the habits of
civilization.]1 Hie'here seems to be the preferable
reading; alluding to Rome, in contradistinction to Corcyra.][Footnote 626: His tearful eyes.--Ver.He alludes to the custom of
the nearest relative closing the eyes of the dying person.][Footnote 627: The last gifts.--Ver.The perfumes and other
offerings which were thrown on the burning pile, are here alluded to.Tibullus says, in the same Elegy--]

'Non soror Assyrios cineri quæ dedat odores,]

Et Heat effusis ante sepulchra comis']

'No sister have I here to present to my ashes the Assyrian perfumes,
and to weep before my tomb with dishevelled locks.'To this passage Ovid
makes reference in the next two lines.][Footnote 628: Thy first love.--Ver.'Prior;' his former love was
Delia, who was forsaken by him for Nemesis.They are both represented
here as attending his obsequies.Tibullus says, in the First Elegy of
the First Book, addressing Delia:--]

1 Te spectem, suprema mihi cum venerit hora,]

Te teneam moriens, déficiente manu.]Flebis et arsuro positum me, Delia, lecto,]

Tristibus et lacrymis oscula mista dabis.']May I look upon you when my last hour comes, when dying, may I hold you
with my failing hand.Delia, you will lament me, too, when placed on my
bier, doomed to the pile, and will give me kisses mingled with the tears
of grief.'It would appear
from the present passage, that it was the custom to give the last kiss
when the body was laid on the funeral pile.][Footnote 629: With his failing hand.--Ver.Nemesis here alludes
to the above line, and tells Delia, that she, herself, alone engaged his
affection, as it was she alone who held his hand when he died.][Footnote 630: Learned Catullus.--Ver.Catullus was a Roman poet, a
native of Verona.Calvus was also a Roman poet of great merit.The poems
of Catullus and Calvus were set to music by Hermogenes, Tigellius, and
Demetrius, who were famous composers.lines
427 and 431, and the Notes to the passages.][Footnote 631: Prodigal of thy blood.--Ver.He alludes to the fact
of Gallus having killed himself, and to his having been suspected
of treason against Augustus, from whom he had received many marks of
kindness Ovid seems to hint, in the Tristia, Book ii.446, that the
fault of Gallus was his having divulged the secrets of Augustus, when
he was in a state o* inebriety.Some writers say, that when Governor of
Egypt, he caused his name and exploits to be inscribed on the Pyramids,
and that this constituted his crime.Others again, suppose that he was
guilty of extortion in Egypt, and that he especially harassed the people
of Thebea with his exactions.Some of the Commentators think that under
the name 'amicus,' Augustus is not here referred to, inasmuch as it
woulc seem to bespeak a familiar acquaintanceship, which is not known
to have existed.Scaliger thinks that it must refer to some
misunderstanding which had taken place between Gallus and Tibullus, in
which the former was accused of having deceived his friend.][Footnote 632: The rites of Ceres--Ver.This festival of Ceres
occurred on the Fifth of the Ides of April, being the 12th day of that
month.White garments, were worn at this
festival, and woollen robes of dark colour were prohibited.The worship
was conducted solely by females, and all intercourse with men was
forbidden, who were not allowed to approach the altars of the Goddess.][Footnote 633: The oaks, the early oracles.--Ver.On the oaks, the
oracles of Dodona, see the Translation of the Metamorphoses, pages 253
and 467.][Footnote 634: Having nurtured Jove.--Ver.See an account of the
education of Jupiter, by the Curetes, in Crete, in the Fourth Book of
the Fasti, L 499, et seq.][Footnote 635: Beheld Jasius.--Ver.Iasius, or Iasion, was,
according to most accounts, the son of Jupiter and Electra, and enjoyed
the favour of Ceres, by whom he was the father of Plutus.According
to the Scholiast on Theocritus, he was the son of Minos, and the Nymph
Phronia.According to Apollodorus, he was struck dead by the bolts of
Jupiter, for offering violence to Ceres.He was also said by some to
be the husband of Cybele.He is supposed to have been a successful
husbandman when agriculture was but little known; which circumstance is
thought to have given rise to the story of his familiarity with Ceres.Ovid repeats this charge against the chastity of Ceres, in the Tristia,
Book ii.[Footnote 636: Proportion of their wheat.--Ver.With less corn than
had been originally sown.][Footnote 637: The law-giving Mims.--Ver.Minos is said to have
been the first who gave laws to the Cretans.][Footnote 638: Late have the horns.--Ver.This figure is derived
from the horns, the weapons of the bull.'At length I have assumed the
weapons of defence.'It is rendered in a singular manner in Nisard's
Translation, 'Trop tard, helas 1 J'ai connu l'outrage fait a mon front.'I have known the outrage done to my forehead.'!!!][Footnote 639: Have patience and endure.--Ver.He addresses himself,
recommending fortitude as his only cure.][Footnote 640: The hard ground.--Ver.At the door of his mistress;
a practice which seems to have been very prevalent with the Roman
lovers.][Footnote 641: I was beheld by him.--Ver.As, of courser, his rival
would only laugh at him for his folly, and very deservedly.][Footnote 642: As you walked.--Ver.By the use of the word
'spatiantis,' he alludes to her walks under the Porticos of Rome, which
were much frequented as places for exercise, sheltered from the heat.][Footnote 643: The Gods forsworn.--Ver.This forms the subject of
the Third Elegy of the present Book.][Footnote 644: Young mem at banquets.--Ver.See the Fifth Elegy of
the Second Book of the Amores.][Footnote 645: She was not ill.--Ver.When he arrived, he found his
rival in her company.][Footnote 646: I will hate.--Ver.This and the next line are
considered by Heinsius and other Commentators to be spurious.][Footnote 647: She who but lately.--Ver.Commentators are at a
loss to know whether he is here referring to Corinna, or to his other
mistress, to whom he alludes in the Tenth Elegy of the Second Book,
when he confesses that he is in love with two mistresses.If Corinna was
anything more than an ideal personage, it is probable that she is not
meant here, as he made it a point not to discover to the world who was
meant under that name; whereas, the mistress here mentioned has been
recommended to the notice of the Roman youths by his poems.][Footnote 648: Made proclamation.--Ver.He says that, unconsciously,
he has been doing the duties of the 'præco' or 'crier,' in recommending
his mistress to the public.The 'præco,' among the Romans, was employed
in sales by auction, to advertise the time, place, and conditions of
sale, and very probably to recommend and praise the property offered
for sale.These officers also did the duty of the auctioneer, so far
as calling out the biddings, but the property was knocked down by the
'magister auctionum.'The 'præcones' were also employed to keep silence
in the public assemblies, to pronounce the votes of the centuries, to
summon the plaintiff and defendant upon trials, to proclaim the victors
in the public games, to invite the people to attend public funerals,
to recite the laws that were enacted, and, when goods were lost, to cry
them and search for them.The office of a 'præco' was, in the time of
Cicero, looked upon as rather disreputable.][Footnote 649: Thebes.--Ver.He speaks of the Theban war, the
Trojan war, and the exploits of Caesar, as being good subjects for Epic
poetry; but he says that he had neglected them, and had wasted his time
in singing in praise of Corinna.This, however, may be said in reproof
of his general habits of indolence, and not as necessarily implying that
Corinna is the cause of his present complaint.The Roman poet Statius
afterwards chose the Theban war as his subject.][Footnote 650: Poets as witnesses.--Ver.That is, 'to rely
implicitly on the testimony of poets.'The word 'poetas' requires a
semicolon after it, and not a comma.][Footnote 651: The raging dogs.--Ver.He here falls into his usual
mistake of confounding Scylla, the daughter of Nisus, with Scylla, the
Nymph, the rival of Circe, in the affections of Glaucus.33 of the First Epistle of Sabinus, and the Eighth and Fourteenth
Books of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 652: Descendant of Abas.--Ver.In the Fourth Book of the
Metamorphoses he relates the rescue of Andromeda from the sea monster,
by Perseus, the descendant of Abas, and clearly implies that he used
the services of the winged horse Pegasus on that occasion.It has been
suggested by some Commentators, that he here refers to Bellerophon; but
that hero was not a descendant of Abas, and, singularly enough, he is
not on any occasion mentioned or referred to by Ovid.][Footnote 653: Extended Tityus.--Ver.Tityus was a giant, the son
of Jupiter and Elara.Offering violence to Latona, he was pierced by the
darts of Apollo and hurled to the Infernal Regions, where his liver was
doomed to feed a vulture, without being consumed.][Footnote 654: Enceladus.--Ver.He was the son of Titan and Terra,
and joining in the war against the Gods, he was struck by lightning,
and thrown beneath Mount Ætna.See the Pontic Epistles, Book ii.[Footnote 655: The-two-shaped damsels.--Ver.He evidently alludes
to the Sirens, with their two shapes, and not to Circe, as some have
imagined.][Footnote 656: The Ithacan bags.--Ver.Æolus gave Ulysses
favourable wind* sewn up in a leather bag, to aid him in his return to
Ithaca.See tha Metamorphoses, Book xiv.223]

[Footnote 657: The Cecropian bird.--Ver.He calls Philomela the
daughter of Pandion, king of Athens, 'Cecropis ales Cc crops having been
the first king of Athens.Her story is told in the Sixth Book of the
Metamorphoses.][Footnote 658: A bird, or into gold.--Ver.He alludes to the
transformation of Jupiter into a swan, a shower of gold, and a bull; in
the cases of Leda, Danaë, and Europa.][Footnote 659: The Theban seed.--Ver.He alludes to the dragon's
teeth sown by Cadmus.See the Third Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 660: Distil amber tears.--Ver.Reference is made to the
transformation of the sisters of Phaeton into poplars that distilled
amber.See the Second Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 661: Who once were ships.--Ver.He alludes to the ships
of Æneas, which, when set on fire by Turnus, were changed into sea
Nymphs.][Footnote 662: The hellish banquet.--Ver.Reference is made to the
revenge of Atreus, who killed the children of Thyestes, and set them
on table before their father, on which occasion the Sun is said to have
hidden his face.][Footnote 663: Stonesfollowed the lyre.--Ver.Amphion is said to
have raised the walls of Thebes by the sound of his lyre.][Footnote 664: Camillus, by thee.--Ver.Marcus Furius Camillus, the
Roman general, took the city of Falisci.][Footnote 665: The covered paths.--Ver.The pipers, or flute
players, led the procession, while the ground was covered with carpets
or tapestry.][Footnote 666: Snow-white heifers.--Ver.Pliny the Elder, in his
Second Book, says, 'The river Clitumnus, in the state of Falisci, makes
those cattle white that drink of its waters.'][Footnote 667: In the lofty woods.--Ver.It is not known to what
occasion this refers.Juno is stated to have concealed herself on two
occasions; once before her marriage, when she fled from the pursuit of
Jupiter, who assumed the form of a cuckoo, that he might deceive her;
and again, when, through fear of the giants, the Gods took refuge in
Egypt and Libya.[Footnote 668: As a mark.--Ver.This is similar to the alleged
origin of the custom of throwing sticks at cocks on Shrove Tuesday.The
Saxons being about to rise in rebellion against their Norman oppressors,
the conspiracy is said to have been discovered through the inopportune
crowing of a cock, in revenge for which the whole race of chanticleers
were for centuries submitted to this cruel punishment.][Footnote 669: With garments.--Ver.As'vestis' was a general name
for a covering of any kind, it may refer to the carpets which appear to
be mentioned in the twelfth line, or it may mean, that the youths and
damsels threw their own garments in the path of the procession.][Footnote 670: After the Grecian manner.--Ver.Falisci was said to
have been a Grecian colony.][Footnote 671: Hold religious silence.--Ver.'Favere linguis' seems
here to mean, 'to keep religious silence as to the general meaning of
the term, see the Fasti, Book i.[Footnote 672: Halesus.--Ver.Halesus is said to have been the son
of Agamemnon, by a concubine.Alarmed at the tragic death of his father,
and of the murderers, Ægisthus and Clytemnestra, he fled to Italy, where
he founded the city of Phalesus, which title, with the addition of
one letter, was given to it after his name.Phalesus afterwards became
corrupted, to 'Faliscus,' or 'Falisci.'][Footnote 673: One side and the other.--Ver.For the 'torus
exterior' and 'interior,' and the construction of the beds of the
ancients, see the Note to the Eighth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.This passage seems to be hopelessly
corrupt.][Footnote 674: Turning-place is grazed.--Ver.On rounding the'meta'
in the chariot race, from which the present figure is derived, see the
Note to the 69th line of the Second Elegy of this Book.][Footnote 675: Heir to my rank.--Ver.112, where he enlarges upon the rank and circumstances of his family.][Footnote 676: To glorious arms.--Ver.He alludes to the Social
war which was commenced in the year of the City 659, by the Marsi, the
Peligni, and the Picentes, for the purpose of obtaining equal rights
and privileges with the Roman citizens.He calls them 'arma honesta,'
because wielded in defence of their liberties.][Footnote 677: Rome dreaded.--Ver.The Romans were so alarmed, that
they vowed to celebrate games in honour of Jupiter, if their arms should
prove successful.][Footnote 678: Amathusian parent.--Ver.Venus was worshipped
especially at Amathus, a city of Cyprus; it is mentioned by Ovid as
abounding in metals.[Footnote 679: The homed.--Ver.In addition to the reasons already
mentioned for Bacchus being represented as horned, it is said, by some,
that it arose from the fact, of wine being drunk from horns in the
early ages.It has been suggested, that it had a figurative meaning, and
implied the violence of those who are overtaken with wine.][Footnote 680: Lyæus.--Ver.For the meaning of the word Lyæus, see
the Metamorphoses, Book iv.[Footnote 681: My sportive.--Ver.Genialis; the Genii were the
Deities of pure, unadorned nature.58, and
the Note to the passage.'Genialis,' consequently, 'voluptuous,' or
'pleasing to the impulses of nature.']It was
prearranged that Theodore, in the sixth or seventh round, was to knock
Hill out, but as the battle progressed, Theodore made a false pass and
Hill could not desist from taking advantage of it, and the prearranged
plan was reversed by Hill knocking Theodore out.And Hill has kept
right on taking advantage of the false movements of his adversaries,
and is now knocking them out with more adroitness than he did forty
years ago.PRINTERS AND EDITORS OF TERRITORIAL DAYS.SHELLEY THE PIONEER PRINTER OF MINNESOTA--A LARGE NUMBER OF

only known survivors: H.O.Bassford, George W. Benedict, David Brock,
John C. Devereux, Barrett Smith, J.B.H.Mitchell, David Ramaley, M.R.Prendergast, Jacob T. McCoy, A.S.Much has been written of the trials and tribulations of the pioneer
editors of Minnesota and what they have accomplished in bringing to
the attention of the outside world the numerous advantages possessed
by this state as a place of permanent location for all classes of
people, but seldom, if ever, has the nomadic printer, "the man behind
the gun," received even partial recognition from the chroniclers of
our early history.In the spring of 1849 James M. Goodhue arrived in
St.Paul from Lancaster, Wis., with a Washington hand press and a few
fonts of type, and he prepared to start a paper at the capital of the
new territory of Minnesota.Accompanying him were two young printers,
named Ditmarth and Dempsey, they being the first printers to set foot
on the site of what was soon destined to be the metropolis of the
great Northwest.These two young men quickly tired of their isolation
and returned to their former home.They were soon followed by another
young man, who had only recently returned from the sunny plains
of far-off Mexico, where he had been heroically battling for his
country's honor.Shelly was born in Bucks county, Pa.,
on the 25th of September, 1827.When a mere lad he removed to
Philadelphia, where he was instructed in the art preservative, and, on
the breaking out of the Mexican war, he laid aside the stick and rule
and placed his name on the roster of a company that was forming to
take part in the campaign against the Mexicans.He was assigned to
the Third United States dragoons and started at once for the scene of
hostilities.On arriving at New Orleans the Third dragoons was ordered
to report to Gen.Taylor, who was then in the vicinity of Matamoras.Taylor was in readiness he drove the Mexicans across
the Rio Grande, and the battles of Palo Alto, Monterey and Buena Vista
followed in quick succession, in all of which the American forces
were successful against an overwhelming force of Mexicans, the Third
dragoons being in all the engagements, and they received special
mention for their conspicuous gallantry in defending their position
against the terrible onslaught of the Mexican forces under the
leadership of Santa Ana.Soon after the battle of Buena Vista, Santa
Ana withdrew from Gen.Taylor's front and retreated toward the City
of Mexico, in order to assist in the defense of that city against the
American forces under the command of Gen.Peace was declared in
1848 and the Third dragoons were ordered to Jefferson barracks, St.Louis, where they were mustered out of the service.Shelly took
passage in a steamer for St.Paul, where he arrived in July, 1849,
being the first printer to permanently locate in Minnesota.The
Pioneer was the first paper printed in St.Paul, but the Register and
Chronicle soon followed.Shelly's first engagement was in the
office of the Register, but he soon changed to the Pioneer, and was
employed by Mr.Goodhue at the time of his tragic death.Shelly was connected
with that office, and remained there until the Pioneer and Democrat
consolidated.Shelly was a member of the old Pioneer guards, and
when President Lincoln called for men to suppress the rebellion the
old patriotism was aroused in him, and he organized, in company with
Major Brackett, a company for what was afterward known as Brackett's
battalion.Brackett's battalion consisted of three Minnesota companies, and they
were mustered into service in September, 1861.They were ordered to
report at Benton barracks, Mo., and were assigned to a regiment known
as Curtis horse, but afterward changed to Fifth Iowa cavalry.In
February, 1862, the regiment was ordered to Fort Henry, Tenn., and
arrived just in time to take an important part in the attack and
surrender of Fort Donelson.Brackett's battalion was the only
Minnesota force engaged at Fort Donelson, and, although they were
not in the thickest of the fight, yet they performed tremendous and
exhaustive service in preventing the rebel Gen.Buckner from receiving
reinforcements.After the surrender the regiment was kept on continual
scout duty, as the country was overrun with bands of guerrillas and
the inhabitants nearly all sympathized with them.From Fort Donelson
three companies of the regiment went to Savannah, (one of them being
Capt.Shelly's) where preparations were being made to meet Gen.Beauregard, who was only a short distance away.Brackett's company was
sent out in the direction of Louisville with orders to see that the
roads and bridges were not molested, so that the forces under Gen.Buell would not be obstructed on the march to reinforce Gen.Buell to arrive at Pittsburg
Landing just in time to save Gen.Shelly's company was engaged in
protecting the long line of railroad from Columbus, Ky., to Corinth,
Miss.On the 25th of August, 1862, Fort Donalson was attacked by the
rebels and this regiment was ordered to its relief.This attack of the
rebels did not prove to be very serious, but on the 5th of February,
1863, the rebels under Forrest and Wheeler made a third attack on Fort
Donelson.They were forced to retire, leaving a large number of their
dead on the field, but fortunately none of the men under Capt.Nearly the entire spring and summer of 1863 was spent in
scouring the country in the vicinity of the Tennessee river, sometimes
on guard duty, sometimes on the picket line and often in battle.They
were frequently days and nights without food or sleep, but ever kept
themselves in readiness for an attack from the wily foes.Opposed to
them were the commands of Forest and Wheeler, the very best cavalry
officers in the Confederate service.A number of severe actions ended
in the battle of Chickamauga, in which the First cavalry took a
prominent part.After the battle of Chickamauga the regiment was kept
on duty on the dividing line between the two forces.About the 1st
of January, 1864, most of Capt.Shelly's company reinlisted and they
returned home on a thirty days' furlough.After receiving a number
of recruits at Fort Snelling, the command, on the 14th of May, 1864,
received orders to report to Gen.Sully at Sioux City, who was
preparing to make a final campaign against the rebellious Sioux.On
the 28th of June the expedition started on its long and weary march
over the plains of the Dakotas toward Montana.It encountered the
Indians a number of times, routing them, and continued on its way.About the middle of August the expedition entered the Bad Lands, and
the members were the first white men to traverse that unexplored
region.In the fall the battalion returned to Fort Ridgley, where
they went into winter quarters, having marched over 3,000 miles since
leaving Fort Snelling.Shelly was mustered out of the service in
the spring of 1865, and since that time, until within a few years, has
been engaged at his old profession.Shelly was almost painfully modest, seldom alluding to the many
stirring events with which he had been an active participant, and it
could well be said of him, as Cardinal Wolsey said of himself, that
"had he served his God with half the zeal he has served his country,
he would not in his old age have forsaken him."Political preferment
and self-assurance keep some men constantly before the public eye,
while others, the men of real merit, who have spent the best part of
their lives in the service of their country, are often permitted by an
ungrateful community to go down to their graves unhonored and unsung.*       *       *       *       *

OTHER PRINTERS IN THE CIVIL WAR.Henry C. Coates was foreman of the job department of the Pioneer
office.He was an officer in the Pioneer Guards, and when the war
broke out was made a lieutenant in the First regiment, was in all the
battles of that famous organization up to and including Gettysburg;
was commander of the regiment for some time after the battle.After
the war he settled in Philadelphia, where he now resides.Jacob J. Noah at one time set type, with Robert Bonner.He was elected
clerk of the supreme court at the first election of state officers;
was captain of Company K Second Minnesota regiment, but resigned early
in the war and moved to New York City, his former home.Frank H. Pratt was an officer in the Seventh regiment and served
through the war.He published a paper at Taylor's Falls at one time.After the war he was engaged in the mercantile business in St.John C. Devereux was foreman of the old Pioneer and was an officer in
the Third regiment, and still resides in the city.Jacob T. McCoy was an old-time typo and worked in all the St.Paul
offices before and after the rebellion.McCoy was a fine singer
and his voice was always heard at typographical gatherings.He
enlisted as private in the Second Minnesota and served more than four
years, returning as first lieutenant.He now resides in Meadeville,
Pa.Martin Williams was printer, editor, reporter and publisher, both
before and after the war.He was quartermaster of the Second Minnesota
cavalry.Robert P. Slaughter and his brother, Thomas Slaughter, were both
officers in the volunteer service and just previous to the rebellion
were engaged in the real estate business.Edward Richards was foreman of the Pioneer and Minnesotian before the
war and foreman of the old St.He enlisted
during the darkest days of the rebellion in the Eighth regiment and
served in the dual capacity of correspondent and soldier.No better
soldier ever left the state.He was collector of customs of the port
of St.Paul under the administration of Presidents Garfield and
Arthur, and later was on the editorial staff of the Pioneer Press.The most remarkable compositor ever in the Northwest, if not in the
United States, was the late Charles R. Stuart.He claimed to be a
lineal descendant of the royal house of Stuart.For two years in
succession he won the silver cup in New York city for setting more
type than any of his competitors.At an endurance test in New York he
is reported to have set and distributed 26,000 ems solid brevier in
twenty-four hours.In the spring of
1858 he wandered into the Minnesotian office and applied for work.The
Minnesotian was city printer and was very much in need of some one
that day to help them out.Stuart was put to work and soon
distributed two cases of type, and the other comps wondered what he
was going to do with it.After he had been at work a short time
they discovered that he would be able to set up all the type he had
distributed and probably more, too.When he pasted up the next morning
the foreman measured his string and remeasured it, and then went over
and took a survey of Mr.Stuart, and then went back and measured it
again.He then called up the comps, and they looked it over, but no
one could discover anything wrong with it.The string measured 23,000
ems, and was the most remarkable feat of composition ever heard of in
this section of the country.Stuart to set 2,000 ems of solid bourgeois an hour, and keep it up for
the entire day.Stuart's reputation as a rapid compositor spread
all over the city in a short time and people used to come to the
office to see him set type, with as much curiosity as they do now to
see the typesetting machine.Stuart enlisted in the Eighth
regiment and served for three years, returning home a lieutenant.For
a number of years he published a paper at Sault Ste Marie, in which
place he died about five years ago.He was not only a good printer,
but a very forceful writer, in fact he was an expert in everything
connected with the printing business.Lightbourn was one of the old-time printers.He served three
years in the Seventh Minnesota and after the war was foreman of the
Pioneer.Clum is one of the oldest printers in St.He was born in
Rensselar county, New York, in 1832, and came to St.He learned his trade in Troy, and worked with John M. Francis, late
minister to Greece, and also with C.L.McArthur, editor of the
Northern Budget.Clum was a member of Company D, Second Minnesota,
and took part in several battles in the early part of the rebellion.Chancy came to Minnesota before the state was admitted to the
Union.At one time he was foreman of a daily paper at St.During the war he was a member of Berdan's sharpshooters, who
were attached to the First regiment.S J. Albright worked on the Pioneer in territorial days.In 1859 he
went to Yankton, Dak., and started the first paper in that territory.He was an officer in a Michigan regiment during the rebellion.For
many years was a publisher of a paper in Michigan, and under the last
administration of Grover Cleveland was governor of Alaska.Prendergast, though not connected with the printing business
for some time, yet he is an old time printer, and was in the Tenth
Minnesota during the rebellion.Underwood was a member of Berdan's Sharp-shooters, and was
connected with a paper at Fergus Falls for a number of years.Robert V. Hesselgrave was employed in nearly all the St.He was lieutenant in the First Minnesota Heavy
Artillery, and is now engaged in farming in the Minnesota valley.He was a
member of the Seventh Minnesota.Ole Johnson was a member of the First Minnesota regiment, and died in
a hospital in Virginia.William F. Russel, a compositor on the Pioneer, organized a company of
sharpshooters in St.Paul, and they served throughout the war in the
army of the Potomac.S. Teverbaugh and H.I.Vance were territorial printers, and were both
in the army, but served in regiments outside the state.There were a large number of other printers in the military service
during the civil war, but they were not territorial printers and their
names are not included in the above list.TERRITORIAL PRINTERS IN CIVIL LIFE.One of the brightest of the many bright young men who came to
Minnesota at an early day was Mr.For a time he worked on
the case at the old Pioneer office, but was soon transferred to the
editorial department, where he remained for a number of years.After
the war he returned to Pittsburgh, his former home, and is now and for
a number of years has been editor-in-chief of the Pittsburgh Post.Paul who were musically inclined
no one was better known than the late O.G.He belonged to the
Great Western band, and was tenor singer in several churches in the
city for a number of years.Miller was a 33d Degree Mason, and
when he died a midnight funeral service was held for him in Masonic
hall, the first instance on record of a similar service in the city.Paul in 1850, and for a short time was
foreman for Mr.In 1852 he formed a partnership with John P.
Owens in the publication of the Minnesotian.He sold his interest
in that paper to Dr.Foster in 1860, and in 1861 was appointed by
President Lincoln collector of the port of St.Paul, a position he
held for more than twenty years.Louis E. Fisher was one of God's noblemen.Paul he was foreman of the Commercial Advertiser.For a long time he
was one of the editors of the Pioneer, and also the Pioneer Press.He
was a staunch democrat and a firm believer in Jeffersonian simplicity.At one time he was a candidate for governor on the democratic ticket.Had it not been for a little political chicanery he would have been
nominated, and had he been elected would have made a model governor.George W. Armstrong was the Beau Brummel of the early printers.He
wore kid gloves when he made up the forms of the old Pioneer, and he
always appeared as if he devoted more attention to his toilet than
most of his co-laborers.He was elected state treasurer on the
democratic ticket in 1857, and at the expiration of his term of office
devoted his attention to the real estate business.Another old printer that was somewhat fastidious was James M.
Culver.Old members of the Sons of Malta will recollect
how strenuously he resisted the canine portion of the ceremony when
taking the third degree of that noble order.He is one of the best as well as
one of the best known printers in the Northwest.He has been printer,
reporter, editor, publisher and type founder.Although he has been
constantly in the harness for nearly fifty years, he is still active
and energetic and looks as if it might be an easy matter to round out
the century mark.Bassford, now of the Austin Register, was one of the fleetest and
cleanest compositers among the territorial printers.He was employed
on the Minnesotian.Francis P. McNamee occupied most all positions connected with the
printing business--printer, reporter, editor.He was a most estimable
man, but of very delicate constitution, and he has long since gone to
his reward.The genial, jovial face of George W. Benedict was for many years
familiar to most old-time residents.At one time he was foreman of the
old St.He is now editor and publisher of the Sauk Rapids
Sentinel.Paul Times had no more reliable man than the late Richard
Bradley.He was foreman of the job department of that paper, and held
the same position on the Press and Pioneer Press for many years.Paine was the author of the famous poem entitled "Who Stole Ben
Johnson's Spaces."The late John O. Terry was the first hand pressman in St.Owens in the publication of the
Minnesotian.For a long time he was assistant postmaster of St.Paul,
and held several other positions of trust.Mitchell was a, member of the firm of Newson, Mitchell & Clum,
publishers of the Daily Times.For several years after the war he was
engaged as compositor in the St.Paul offices, and is now farming in
Northern Minnesota.Among the freaks connected with the printing business was a poet
printer by the name of Wentworth.He was called "Long Haired
Wentworth."Early in the war he enlisted in the First Minnesota regiment.Gorman caught sight of him he ordered his hair cut.Wentworth
would not permit his flowing locks to be taken off, and he was
summarly dismissed from the service.After being ordered out of the
regiment he wrote several letters of doubtful loyalty and Secretary
Stanton had him arrested and imprisoned in Fort Lafayette with other
political prisoners.Marshall Robinson was a partner of the late John H. Stevens in the
publication of the first paper at Glencoe.At one time he was a
compositor on the Pioneer, and the last heard from him he was state
printer for Nevada.Robertson and made foreman of the Democrat.He was a
printer-politician and possessed considerable ability.At one time he
was one of the editors of the Democrat.He was said to bear a striking
resemblance to the late Stephen A. Douglas, and seldom conversed with
any one without informing them of the fact.He was one of the original
Jacksonian Democrats, and always carried with him a silver dollar,
which he claimed was given him by Andrew Jackson when he was
christened.No matter how much Democratic principle Jack would consume
on one of his electioneering tours he always clung to the silver
dollar.He died in Ohio more than forty years ago, and it is said that
the immediate occasion of his demise was an overdose of hilarity.Another old timer entitled to a good position in the hilarity column
was J.Q.A.He was business manager
of the Minnesotian during the prosperous days of that paper.The first
immigration pamphlet ever gotten out in the territory was the product
of Jack's ingenuity.Jack created quite a sensation at one time by
marrying the daughter of his employer on half an hour's ball room
acquaintance.He was a very bright man and should have been one of the
foremost business men of the city, but, like many other men, he was
his own worst enemy.Another Jack that should not be overlooked was Jack Barbour.His
theory was that in case the fiery king interfered with your business
it was always better to give up the business.Carver was one of the best job printers in the country, and he
was also one of the best amateur actors among the fraternity.It was
no uncommon thing for the old time printers to be actors and actors to
be printers.Lawrence Barrett, Stuart Robson and many other eminent
actors were knights of the stick and rule.Frequently during the happy
distribution hour printers could be heard quoting from the dramatist
and the poet, and occasionally the affairs of church and state would
receive serious consideration, and often the subject would be handled
in a manner that would do credit to the theologian or the diplomat,
but modern ingenuity has made it probable that no more statesmen will
receive their diplomas from the composing room.Since the introduction
of the iron printer all these pleasantries have passed away, and the
sociability that once existed in the composing room will be known
hereafter only to tradition.The late William Jebb was one of the readiest debaters in the old
Pioneer composing room.He was well posted on all topics and was
always ready to take either side of a question for the sake of
argument.Possessing a command of language and fluency of speech that
would have been creditable to some of the foremost orators, he would
talk by the hour, and his occasional outbursts of eloquence often
surprised and always entertained the weary distributors.At one time
Jebb was reporter on the St.Raising blooded chickens
was one of his hobbies.One night some one entered his premises and
appropriated, a number of his pet fowls.The next day the Times had a
long account of his misfortune, and at the conclusion of his article
he hurled the pope's bull of excommunication at the miscreant.It was
a fatal bull and was Mr.A fresh graduate from the case at one time wrote a scurrilous
biography of Washington.The editor of the paper on which he was
employed was compelled to make editorial apology for its unfortunate
appearance.To make the matter more offensive the author on several
different occasions reproduced the article and credited its authorship
to the editor who was compelled to apologize for it.In two different articles on nationalities by two different young
printer reporters, one referred to the Germans as "the beer-guzzling
Dutch," and the other, speaking of the English said "thank the Lord we
have but few of them in our midst," caused the writers to be promptly
relegated back to the case.Bishop Willoughby was a well-known character of the early times.A
short conversation with him would readily make patent the fact that he
wasn't really a bishop.In an account of confirming a number of people
at Christ church a very conscientious printer-reporter said "Bishop
Willoughby administered the rite of confirmation," when he should have
said Bishop Whipple.He was so mortified at his unfortunate blunder
that he at once tendered his resignation.Editors and printers of territorial times were more closely affiliated
than they are to-day.Meager hotel accommodations and necessity for
economical habits compelled many of them to work and sleep in the same
room.All the offices contained blankets and cots, and as morning
newspapers were only morning newspapers in name, the tired and weary
printer could sleep the sleep of the just without fear of disturbance.Earle S. Goodrich,
editor-in-chief of the Pioneer: Thomas Foster, editor of the
Minnesotian; T.M.Newson, editor of the Times, and John P. Owens,
first editor of the Minnesotian, were all printers.When the old Press
removed from Bridge Square in 1869 to the new building on the corner
of Third and Minnesota streets, Earle S. Goodrich came up into the
composing room and requested the privilege of setting the first type
in the new building.He was provided with a stick and rule and set

A DECISIVE VICTORY--THE SECOND MINNESOTA THE HEROES OF THE DAY--THE
REBEL GENERAL ZOLLICOFFER KILLED.Every Minnesotian's heart swells with pride whenever mention is made
of the grand record of the volunteers from the North Star State in the
great struggle for the suppression of the rebellion.At the outbreak
of the war Minnesota was required to furnish one regiment, but so
intensely patriotic were its citizens that nearly two regiments
volunteered at the first call of the president.As only ten companies
could go in the first regiment the surplus was held in readiness for
a second call, which it was thought would be soon forthcoming.On the
16th of June, 1861, Gov.Ramsey received notice that a second regiment
would be acceptable, and accordingly the companies already organized
with two or three additions made up the famous Second Minnesota.Van Cleve was appointed colonel, with headquarters at Fort Snelling.Several of the companies were sent to the frontier to relieve
detachments of regulars stationed at various posts, but on the 16th of
October, 1861, the full regiment started for Washington.On reaching
Pittsburgh, however, their destination was changed to Louisville, at
which place they were ordered to report to Gen.Sherman, then in
command of the Department of the Cumberland, and they at once received
orders to proceed to Lebanon Junction, about thirty miles south of
Louisville.The regiment remained at this camp about six weeks before
anything occurred to relieve the monotony of camp life, although there
were numerous rumors of night attacks by large bodies of Confederates.On the 15th of November, 1861, Gen.Buell assumed command of all the
volunteers in the vicinity of Louisville, and he at once organized
them into divisions and brigades.Early in December the Second
regiment moved to Lebanon, Ky., and, en route, the train was fired at.At Lebanon the Second Minnesota, Eighteenth United States infantry,
Ninth and Thirty-fifth Ohio regiments were organized into a brigade,
and formed part of Gen.Thomas started his troops on the Mill Springs campaign
and from the 1st to the 17th day of January, spent most of its time
marching under rain, sleet and through mud, and on the latter date
went into camp near Logan's Cross Roads, eight miles north of
Zollicoffer's intrenched rebel camp at Beech Grove.18, Company A was on picket duty.It had been raining incessantly
and was so dark that it was with difficulty that pickets could be
relieved.Just at daybreak the rebel advance struck the pickets of
the Union lines, and several musket shots rang out with great
distinctness, and in quick succession, it being the first rebel shot
that the boys had ever heard.The
firing soon commenced again, nearer and more distinct than at first,
and thicker and faster as the rebel advance encountered the Union
pickets.The Second Minnesota had entered the woods and passing
through the Tenth Indiana, then out of ammunition and retiring and no
longer firing.The enemy, emboldened by the cessation and mistaking
its cause, assumed they had the Yanks on the run, advanced to the rail
fence separating the woods from the field just as the Second Minnesota
was doing the same, and while the rebels got there first, they were
also first to get away and make a run to their rear.But before
they ran their firing was resumed and Minnesotians got busy and the
Fifteenth Mississippi and the Sixteenth Alabama regiments were made
to feel that they had run up against something.To the right of the
Second were two of Kinney's cannon and to their right was the Ninth
Ohio.The mist and smoke which hung closely was too thick to see
through, but by lying down it was possible to look under the smoke and
to see the first rebel line, and that it was in bad shape, and back of
it and down on the low ground a second line, with their third line
on the high ground on the further side of the field.That the Second
Minnesota was in close contact with the enemy was evident all along
its line, blasts of fire and belching smoke coming across the fence
from Mississippi muskets.The contest was at times hand to hand--the
Second Minnesota and the rebels running their guns through the fence,
firing and using the bayonet when opportunity offered.The firing was
very brisk for some time when it was suddenly discovered that
the enemy had disappeared.The battle was over, the Johnnies had
"skedaddled," leaving their dead and dying on the bloody field.Many
of the enemy were killed and wounded, and some few surrendered.After
the firing had ceased one rebel lieutenant bravely stood in front
of the Second and calmly faced his fate.After being called on to
surrender he made no reply, but deliberately raised his hand and shot
Lieut.His name proved
to be Bailie Peyton, son of one of the most prominent Union men in
Tennessee.Zollicoffer, commander of the Confederate forces, was
also killed in this battle.This battle, although a mere skirmish when
compared to many other engagements in which the Second participated
before the close of the war, was watched with great interest by the
people of St.Two full companies had been recruited in the city
and there was quite a number of St.Paulites in other companies of
this regiment.When it became known that a battle had been fought
in which the Second had been active participants, the relatives and
friends of the men engaged in the struggle thronged the newspaper
offices in quest of information regarding their safety.The casualties
in the Second Minnesota, amounted to twelve killed and thirty-five
wounded.Two or three days after the battle letters were received from
different members of the Second, claiming that they had shot Bailie
Payton and Zollicoffer.It afterward was learned that no one ever
knew who shot Peyton, and that Col.Fry of the Fourth Kentucky shot
Zollicoffer.Tuttle captured Peyton's sword and still has it in
his possession.It was presented to
Bailie Peyton by the citizens of New Orleans at the outbreak of the
Mexican war, and was carried by Col.Scott's staff at the close of the war, and
when Santa Anna surrendered the City of Mexico to Gen.Peyton was the staff officer designated by Scott to receive the
surrender of the city, carrying this sword by his side.It bears
this inscription: "Presented to Col.Bailie Peyton, Fifth Regiment
Louisiana Volunteer National Guards, by his friends of New Orleans.His deeds will add glory to
her arms."There has been considerable correspondence between the
government and state, officials and the descendants of Col.Peyton
relative to returning this trophy to Col.Peyton's relatives, but so
far no arrangements to that effect have been concluded.It was reported by Tennesseeans at the time of the battle that young
Peyton was what was known as a "hoop-skirt" convert to the Confederate
cause.Southern ladies were decidedly more pronounced secessionists
than were the sterner sex, and whenever they discovered that one of
their chivalric brethren was a little lukewarm toward the cause of the
South they sent him a hoop skirt, which indicated that the recipient
was lacking in bravery.For telling of his loyalty to the Union he
was insulted and hissed at on the streets of Nashville, and when he
received a hoop skirt from his lady friends he reluctantly concluded
to take up arms against the country he loved so well.He paid the
penalty of foolhardy recklessness in the first battle in which he
participated.A correspondent of the Cincinnati Commercial, who was an eye-witness
of the battle, gave a glowing description of the heroic conduct of the
Second Minnesota during the engagement.He said: "The success of the
battle was when the Second Minnesota and the Ninth Ohio appeared in
good order sweeping through the field.The Second Minnesota, from its
position in the column, was almost in the center of the fight, and in
the heaviest of the enemy's fire.They were the first troops that used
the bayonet, and the style with which they went into the fight is the
theme of enthusiastic comment throughout the army."It was the boast of Confederate leaders at the outbreak of the
rebellion that one regiment of Johnnies was equal to two or more
regiments of Yankees.After the battle of Mill Springs they had
occasion to revise their ideas regarding the fighting qualities of the
detested Yankees.From official reports of both sides, gathered after
the engagement was over, it was shown that the Confederate forces
outnumbered their Northern adversaries nearly three to one.The victory proved a dominant factor in breaking up the Confederate
right flank, and opened a way into East Tennessee, and by transferring
the Union troops to a point from which to menace Nashville made the
withdrawal of Gen.Albert Sidney Johnston's troops from Bowling Green,
Ky., to Nashville necessary.Confederate loss, 600 in killed, wounded and prisoners.Union loss,
248 in killed and wounded.Twelve rebel cannon and caissons complete
were captured.Two hundred wagons with horses in harness were
captured, as were large quantities of ammunition, store and camp
equipments--in fact, the Union troops took all there was.Fry's version of the killing of Zollicoffer is as follows: While
on the border of "old fields" a stranger in citizen clothes rode up by
his side, so near that he could have put his hand upon his shoulder,
and said: "Don't let us be firing on our own men.Those are our men,"
pointing at the same time toward our forces.Fry looked upon him
inquiringly a moment, supposing him to be one of his own men, after
which he rode forward not more than fifteen paces, when an officer
came dashing up, first recognizing the stranger and almost the same
instant firing upon Col.At the same moment the stranger wheeled
his horse, facing Col.Fry, when the colonel shot him in the breast.Zollicoffer was a prominent and influential citizen of Nashville
previous to the war, and stumped the state with Col.Peyton in
opposition to the ordinance of secession, but when Tennessee seceded
he determined to follow the fortunes of his state.Zollicoffer made a speech to his troops in which he said
he would take them to Indiana or go to hell himself.The poet of the Fourth Kentucky perpetrated the following shortly
after the battle:

  "Old Zollicoffer is dead
  And the last word he said:
  I see a wild cat coming.And he hit him in the eye
  And he sent him to the happy land of Canaan.Hip hurrah for the happy land of freedom."The loyal Kentuckians were in great glee and rejoiced over the
victory.It was their battle against rebel invaders from Tennessee,
Mississippi and Alabama, who were first met by their own troops of
Wolford's First cavalry and the Fourth Kentucky infantry, whose blood
was the first to be shed in defense of the Stars and Stripes; and
their gratitude went out to their neighbors from Minnesota, Indiana
and Ohio who came to their support and drove the invaders out of their
state.24, 1862, the Second Minnesota was again in Louisville,
where the regiment had admirers and warm friends in the loyal ladies,
who as evidence of their high appreciation, though the mayor of the
city, Hon.Dolph, presented to the Second regiment a silk flag."Each regiment is equally entitled to like honor, but
the gallant conduct of those who came from a distant state to unite
in subduing our rebel invaders excites the warmest emotions of our
hearts."25 President Lincoln's congratulations were read to the
regiment, and on Feb.9, at Waitsboro, Ky., the following joint
resolution of the Minnesota legislature was read before the regiment:


Whereas, the noble part borne by the First regiment, Minnesota
infantry, in the battles of Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, Va., is
yet fresh in our minds; and, whereas, we have heard with equal
satisfaction the intelligence of the heroism displayed by the Second
Minnesota infantry in the late brilliant action at Mill Springs, Ky.:

Therefore be it resolved by the legislature of Minnesota, That while
it was the fortune of the veteran First regiment to shed luster upon
defeat, it was reserved for the glorious Second regiment to add
victory to glory.Resolved, that the bravery of our noble sons, heroes whether in defeat
or victory, is a source of pride to the state that sent them forth,
and will never fail to secure to them the honor and the homage of the
government and the people.Resolved, That we sympathize with the friends of our slain soldiers,
claiming as well to share their grief as to participate in the renown
which the virtues and valor of the dead have conferred on our arms.Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions, having the signature
of the executive and the great seal of the state, be immediately
forwarded by the governor to the colonels severally in command of
the regiments, to be by them communicated to their soldiers at dress
parade.The battle at Mill Springs was the first important victory achieved by
the Union army in the Southwest after the outbreak of the rebellion,
and the result of that engagement occasioned great rejoicing
throughout the loyal North.Although the battle was fought forty-five
years ago, quite a number of men engaged in that historic event
are still living in St.Paul, a number of them actively engaged in
business.Clum, William Bircher, Robert G. Rhodes,

OF THE CIVIL WAR--TERRIBLE LOSS OF LIFE--GALLANT ACTION OF THE FIRST
MINNESOTA BATTERY--DEATH OF CAPT.The battle of Pittsburg Landing on the 6th and 7th of April, 1862, was
one of the most terrific of the many great battles of the great Civil
war.It has been likened to the battle of Waterloo.Napoleon sought to
destroy the army of Wellington before a junction could be made with
Blucher.Johnston and Beauregard undertook to annihilate the Army of
the Tennessee, under Gen.Grant, before the Army of the Cumberland,
under Buell, could come to his assistance.At the second battle of
Bull Run Gen.Pope claimed that Porter was within sound of his guns,
yet he remained inactive.At Pittsburg Landing it was claimed by
military men that Gen.Buell could have made a junction with Grant
twenty-four hours sooner and thereby saved a terrible loss of life had
he chosen to do so.Both generals were subsequently suspended from
their commands and charges of disloyalty were made against them by
many newspapers in the North.Porter was tried by court-martial
and dismissed from the service.Many years after this decision was
revoked by congress and the stigma of disloyalty removed from his
name.Buell was tried by court-martial, but the findings of the
court were never made public.Buell
was guilty of the charges against him, and when he became
commander-in-chief of the army in 1864 endeavored to have him restored
to his command, but the war department did not seem inclined to do so.About two weeks before the battle of Pittsburg Landing Gen.Grant
was suspended from the command of the Army of the Tennessee by Gen.Halleck, but owing to some delay in the transmission of the order, an
order came from headquarters restoring him to his command before he
knew that he had been suspended.Grant's success at Fort Henry
and Fort Donelson made his superiors jealous of his popularity.McClellan, but the order was held up by the
war department until Gen.The reason for
his arrest was that he went to Nashville to consult with Buell without
permission of the commanding general.Dispatches sent to Grant for
information concerning his command was never delivered to him, but
were delivered over to the rebel authorities by a rebel telegraph
operator, who shortly afterward joined the Confederate forces.Badeau, one of Grant's staff officers,
was in search of information for his "History of Grant's Military
Campaigns," and he unearthed in the archives of the war department the
full correspondence between Halleck, McClellan and the secretary of
war, and it was not until then that Gen.Grant learned the full extent
of the absurd accusations made against him.Halleck assumed personal
command of all the forces at that point and Gen.Grant was placed
second in command, which meant that he had no command at all.This
was very distasteful to Gen.Grant and he would have resigned his
commission and returned to St.Louis but for the interposition of his
friend, Gen.Grant had packed up his belongings
and was about to depart when Gen.Sherman met him at his tent and
persuaded him to refrain.In a short time Halleck was ordered to
Washington and Grant was made commander of the Department of West
Tennessee, with headquarters at Memphis.Grant's subsequent
career proved the wisdom of Sherman's entreaty.Halleck assumed command he constructed magnificent
fortifications, and they were a splendid monument to his engineering
skill, but they were never occupied.He was like the celebrated king
of France, who "with one hundred thousand men, marched up the hill and
then down again."Halleck had under his immediate command more
than one hundred thousand well equipped men, and the people of
the North looked to him to administer a crushing blow to the then
retreating enemy.The hour had arrived--the man had not."Flushed with the victory of Forts Henry and Donelson," said the
envious Halleck in a dispatch to the war department, previous to
the battle, "the army under Grant at Pittsburg Landing was more
demoralized than the Army of the Potomac after the disastrous defeat
of Bull Run."Scott predicted that the
war would soon be ended--that thereafter there would be nothing but
guerrilla warfare at interior points.Grant himself in his
memoirs says that had the victory at Pittsburg Landing been followed
up and the army been kept intact the battles at Stone River,
Chattanooga and Chickamauga would not have been necessary.Probably the battle of Pittsburg Landing was the most misunderstood
and most misrepresented of any battle occurring during the war.It
was charged that Grant was drunk; that he was far away from the
battleground when the attack was made, and was wholly unprepared to
meet the terrible onslaught of the enemy in the earlier stages of the
encounter.Beauregard is said to have stated on the morning
of the battle that before sundown he would water his horses in the
Tennessee river or in hell.That the rebels did not succeed in
reaching the Tennessee was not from lack of dash and daring on their
part, but was on account of the sturdy resistance and heroism of their
adversaries.Grant's own account of the battle,
though suffering intense pain from a sprained ankle, he was in the
saddle from early morning till late at night, riding from division to
division, giving directions to their commanding officers regarding the
many changes in the disposition of their forces rendered necessary
by the progress of the battle.The firm resistance made by the force
under his command is sufficient refutation of the falsity of the
charges made against him.Misunderstanding of orders, want of
co-operation of subordinates as well as superiors, and rawness of
recruits were said to have been responsible for the terrible slaughter
of the Union forces on the first day of the battle.*       *       *       *       *

The battle of Pittsburg Landing is sometimes called the battle of
Shiloh, some of the hardest lighting having been done in the vicinity
of an old log church called the Church of Shiloh, about three miles
from the landing.The battle ground traversed by the opposing forces occupied a
semi-circle of about three and a half miles from the town of
Pittsburg, the Union forces being stationed in the form of a
semi-circle, the right resting on a point north of Crump's Landing,
the center being directly in front of the road to Corinth, and the
left extending to the river in the direction of Harrisburg--a small
place north of Pittsburg Landing.At about 2 o'clock on Sunday
morning, Col.Peabody of Prentiss' division, fearing that everything
was not right, dispatched a body of 400 men beyond the camp for the
purpose of looking after any body of men which might be lurking in
that direction.This step was wisely taken, for a half a mile advance
showed a heavy force approaching, who fired upon them with great
slaughter.This force taken by surprise, was compelled to retreat,
which they did in good order under a galling fire.At 6 o'clock the
fire had become general along the entire front, the enemy having
driven in the pickets of Gen.Sherman's division and had fallen with
vengeance upon three Ohio regiments of raw recruits, who knew nothing
of the approach of the enemy until they were within their midst.The
slaughter on the first approach of the enemy was very severe, scores
falling at every discharge of rebel guns.It soon became apparent that
the rebel forces were approaching in overwhelming numbers and there
was nothing left for them to do but retreat, which was done with
considerable disorder, both officers and men losing every particle of
their baggage, which fell into rebel hands.At 8:30 o'clock the fight had become general, the second line of
divisions having received the advance in good order and made every
preparation for a suitable reception of the foe.At this time many
thousand stragglers, many of whom had never before heard the sound
of musketry, turned their backs to the enemy, and neither threats or
persuasion could induce them to turn back.Grant, who had hastened up from Savannah, led to the adoption of
measures that put a stop to this uncalled-for flight from the battle
ground.A strong guard was placed across the thoroughfare, with orders
to hault every soldier whose face was turned toward the river, and
thus a general stampede was prevented.At 10 o'clock the entire line
on both sides was engaged in one of the most terrible battles ever
known in this country.The roar of the cannon and musketry was without
intermission from the main center to a point extending halfway down
the left wing.The great struggle was most upon the forces which had
fallen back on Sherman's position.By 11 o'clock quite a number of the
commanders of regiments had fallen, and in some instances not a single
field officer remained; yet the fighting continued with an earnestness
that plainly showed that the contest on both sides was for death or
victory.The almost deafening sound of artillery and the rattle of
musketry was all that could be heard as the men stood silently and
delivered their fire, evidently bent on the work of destruction which
knew no bounds.Foot by foot the ground was contested, a single narrow
strip of open land dividing the opponents.Many who were maimed fell
back without help, while others still fought in the ranks until they
were actually forced back by their company officers.Finding it
impossible to drive back the center of our column, at 12 o'clock the
enemy slackened fire upon it and made a most vigorous effort on our
left wing, endeavoring to drive it to the river bank at a point about
a mile and a half above Pittsburg Landing.With the demonstration of
the enemy upon the left wing it was soon seen that all their fury was
being poured out upon it, with a determination that it should give
way.For about two hours a sheet of fire blazed both columns, the
rattle of musketry making a most deafening noise.For about an hour it
was feared that the enemy would succeed in driving our forces to the
river bank, the rebels at times being plainly seen by those on the
main landing below.While the conflict raged the hottest in this
quarter the gunboat Tyler passed slowly up the river to a point
directly opposite the enemy and poured in a broadside from her immense
guns.The shells went tearing and crashing through the woods, felling
trees in their course and spreading havoc wherever they fell.The
explosions were fearful, the shells falling far inland, and they
struck terror to the rebel force.Foiled in this attempt, they now
made another attack on the center and fought like tigers.They found
our lines well prepared and in full expectation of their coming.Every
man was at his post and all willing to bring the contest to a definite
conclusion.In hourly expectation of the arrival of reinforcements,
under Generals Nelson and Thomas of Buell's army, they made every
effort to rout our forces before the reinforcements could reach the
battle ground.They were, however, fighting against a wall of steel.Volley answered volley and for a time the battle of the morning was
re-enacted on the same ground and with the same vigor on both sides.At 5 o'clock there was a short cessation in the firing of the enemy,
their lines falling back on the center for about half a mile.They
again wheeled and suddenly threw their entire force upon the left
wing, determined to make the final struggle of the day in that
quarter.The gunboat Lexington in the meantime had arrived from
Savannah, and after sending a message to Gen.Grant to ascertain in
which direction the enemy was from the river, the Lexington and Tyler
took a position about half a mile above the river landing, and poured
their shells up a deep ravine reaching to the river on the right.Their shots were thick and fast and told with telling effect.Lew Wallace, who had taken a circuitous route from
Crump's Landing, appeared suddenly on the left wing of the rebels.In
face of this combination the enemy felt that their bold effort was for
the day a failure and as night was about at hand, they slowly fell
back, fighting as they went, until they reached an advantageous
position, somewhat in the rear, yet occupying the main road to
Corinth.The gunboats continued to send their shells after them until
they were far beyond reach.Throughout the day the rebels evidently had fought with the Napoleonic
idea of massing their entire force on weak points of the enemy, with
the intention of braking through their lines, creating a panic and
cutting off retreat.The first day's battle, though resulting in a terrible loss of Union
troops, was in reality a severe disappointment to the rebel leaders.They fully expected, with their overwhelming force to annihilate
Grant's army, cross the Tennessee river and administer the same
punishment to Buell, and then march on through Tennessee, Kentucky and
into Ohio.They had conceived a very bold movement, but utterly failed
to execute it.Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of the Confederate forces,
was killed in the first day's battle, being shot while attempting to
induce a brigade of unwilling Confederates to make a charge on the
enemy.Buell was at Columbia, Tenn., on the 19th of March with a veteran
force of 40,000 men, and it required nineteen days for him to reach
the Tennessee river, eighty-five miles distant, marching less than
five miles a day, notwithstanding the fact that he had been ordered to
make a junction with Grant's forces as soon as possible, and was well
informed of the urgency of the situation.During the night steamers were engaged in carrying the troops of
Nelson's division across the river.As soon as the boats reached the
shore the troops immediately left, and, without music, took their way
to the advance of the left wing of the Union forces.They had come up
double quick from Savannah, and as they were regarded as veterans, the
greatest confidence was soon manifest as to the successful termination
of the battle.With the first hours of daylight it was evident that
the enemy had also been strongly reinforced, for, notwithstanding they
must have known of the arrival of new Union troops, they were first to
open the ball, which they did with considerable alacrity.The attacks
that began came from the main Corinth road, a point to which they
seemed strongly attached, and which at no time did they leave
unprotected.Within half an hour from the first firing in the morning
the contest then again spread in either direction, and both the main
and left wings were not so anxious to fight their way to the river
bank as on the previous day, having a slight experience of what they
might expect if again brought under the powerful guns of the Tyler and
Lexington.They were not, however, lacking in activity, and they
were met by our reinforced troops with an energy that they did not
anticipate.At 9 o'clock the sound of the artillery and musketry fully
equaled that of the day before.It now became evident that the rebels
were avoiding our extreme left wing, and were endeavoring to find a
weak point in our line by which they could turn our force and thus
create a panic.They left one point but to return to it immediately,
and then as suddenly would direct an assault upon a division where
they imagined they would not be expected.The fire of the united
forces was as steady as clockwork, and it soon became evident that
the enemy considered the task they had undertaken a hopeless one.Notwithstanding continued repulses, the rebels up to 11 o'clock had
given no evidence of retiring from the field.Their firing had been as
rapid and vigorous at times as during the most terrible hours of
the previous day.Generals Grant, Buell, Nelson and Crittenden were
present everywhere directing the movements on our part for a new
strike against the foe.Lew Wallace's division on the right had
been strongly reinforced, and suddenly both wings of our army were
turned upon the enemy, with the intention of driving the immense body
into an extensive ravine.At the same time a powerful battery had been
stationed upon an open field, and they poured volley after volley into
the rebel ranks and with the most telling effect.At 11:30 o'clock the
roar of battle almost shook the earth, as the Union guns were being
fired with all the energy that the prospect of ultimate victory
inspired.The fire from the enemy was not so vigorous and they began
to evince a desire to withdraw.They fought as they slowly moved back,
keeping up their fire from their artillery and musketry, apparently
disclaiming any notion that they thought of retreating.As they
retreated they went in excellent order, halting at every advantageous
point and delivering their fire with considerable effect.At noon it
was settled beyond dispute that the rebels were retreating.They were
making but little fire, and were heading their center column for
Corinth.From all divisions of our lines they were closely pursued,
a galling fire being kept up on their rear, which they returned at
intervals with little or no effect.From Sunday morning until Monday
noon not less than three thousand cavalry had remained seated In their
saddles on the hilltop overlooking the river, patiently awaiting the
time when an order should come for them to pursue the flying enemy.That time had now arrived and a courier from Gen.Grant had scarcely
delivered his message before the entire body was in motion.The wild
tumult of the excited riders presented a picture seldom witnessed on a
battlefield.*       *       *       *       *

Gen.Grant, in his memoirs, summarizes the results of the two days'
fighting as follows: "I rode forward several miles the day of the
battle and found that the enemy had dropped nearly all of their
provisions and other luggage in order to enable them to get off with
their guns.An immediate pursuit would have resulted in the capture
of a considerable number of prisoners and probably some guns...." The
effective strength of the Union forces on the morning of the 6th was
33,000 men.Lew Wallace brought 5,000 more after nightfall.Beauregard
reported the rebel strength at 40,955.Excluding the troops who fled,
there was not with us at any time during the day more than 25,000 men
in line.Our loss in the two days' fighting was 1,754 killed, 8,408
wounded and 2,885 missing.Beauregard reported a total loss of 10,699,
of whom 1,728 were killed, 8,012 wounded and 957 missing.Prentiss, during a change of
position of the Union forces, became detached from the rest of the
troops, and was taken prisoner, together with 2,200 of his men.Wallace, division commander, was killed in the early part of
the struggle.The hardest fighting during the first day was done in front of the
divisions of Sherman and McClernand."A casualty to Sherman," says
Gen.Grant, "that would have taken him from the field that day would
have been a sad one for the Union troops engaged at Shiloh.On the 6th Sherman was shot twice, once in the
hand, once in the shoulder, the ball cutting his coat and making a
slight wound, and a third ball passed through his hat.In addition to
this he had several horses shot during the day."Hawkins got beyond the left of our troops.There did not appear
to be an enemy in sight, but suddenly a battery opened on them from
the edge of the woods.They made a hasty retreat and when they were
at a safe distance halted to take an account of the damage.McPherson's horse dropped dead, having been shot just
back of the saddle.Hawkins' hat and a
ball had struck the metal of Gen.Grant's sword, breaking it nearly
off.On the first day of the battle about 6,000 fresh recruits who had
never before heard the sound of musketry, fled on the approach of the
enemy.They hid themselves on the river bank behind the bluff, and
neither command nor persuasion could induce them to move.Buell discovered them on his arrival he threatened to fire on them,
but it had no effect.Grant says that afterward those same men
proved to be some of the best soldiers in the service.Grant, in his report, says he was prepared with the
reinforcements of Gen.Lew Wallace's division of 5,000 men to assume
the offensive on the second day of the battle, and thought he could
have driven the rebels back to their fortified position at Corinth
without the aid of Buell's army.*       *       *       *       *

At banquet hall, regimental reunion or campfire, whenever mention is
made of the glorious record of Minnesota volunteers in the great Civil
war, seldom, if ever, is the First Minnesota battery given credit
for its share in the long struggle.Probably very few of the present
residents of Minnesota are aware that such an organization existed.This battery was one of the finest organizations that left the state
during the great crisis.It was in the terrible battle of Pittsburg
Landing, the siege of Vicksburg, in front of Atlanta and in the great
march from Atlanta to the sea, and in every position in which they
were placed they not only covered themselves with glory, but they were
an honor and credit to the state that sent them.The First Minnesota
battery, light artillery, was organized at Fort Snelling in the fall
of 1861, and Emil Munch was made its first captain.Shortly after
being mustered in they were ordered to St.Louis, where they received
their accoutrements, and from there they were ordered to Pittsburg
Landing, arriving at the latter place late in February, 1862.The day
before the battle, they were transferred to Prentiss' division of
Grant's army.On Sunday morning, April 6, the battery was brought out
bright and early, preparing for inspection.About 7 o'clock great
commotion was heard at headquarters, and the battery was ordered to be
ready to march at a moment's notice.In about ten minutes they were
ordered to the front, the rebels having opened fire on the Union
forces.In a very short time rebel bullets commenced to come thick and
fast, and one of their number was killed and three others wounded.It
soon became evident that the rebels were in great force in front
of the battery, and orders were issued for them to choose another
position.At about 11 o'clock the battery formed in a new position
on an elevated piece of ground, and whenever the rebels undertook to
cross the field in front of them the artillery raked them down with
frightful slaughter.Several times the rebels placed batteries In the
timber at the farther end of the field, but in each instance the
guns of the First battery dislodged them before they could get into
position.For hours the rebels vainly endeavored to break the lines
of the Union forces, but in every instance they were repulsed with
frightful loss, the canister mowing them down at close range.About 5
o'clock the rebels succeeded in flanking Gen.Prentiss and took part
of his force prisoners.The battery was immediately withdrawn to an
elevation near the Tennessee river, and it was not long before firing
again commenced and kept up for half an hour, the ground fairly
shaking from the continuous firing on both sides of the line.At
about 6 o'clock the firing ceased, and the rebels withdrew to a safe
distance from the landing.The casualties of the day were three killed
and six wounded, two of the latter dying shortly afterward.The fight
at what was known as the "hornet's nest" was most terrific, and had
not the First battery held out so heroically and valiantly the rebels
would have succeeded in forcing a retreat of the Union lines to a
point dangerously near the Tennessee river.Munch's horse
received a bullet In his head and fell, and the captain himself
received a wound in the thigh, disabling him from further service
during the battle.Pfaender took
command of the battery, and he had a horse shot from under him during
the day.Buell having arrived, the
battery was held in reserve and did not participate in the battle
that day.The First battery was the only organization from Minnesota
engaged in the battle, and their conduct in the fiercest of the
struggle, and in changing position in face of fire from the whole
rebel line, was such as to receive the warmest commendation from the
commanding officer.It was the first battle in which they had taken
part, and as they had only received their guns and horses a few weeks
before, they had not had much opportunity for drill work.Their
terrible execution at critical times convinced the rebels that they
had met a foe worthy of their steel.*       *       *       *       *

Among the many thousands left dead and dying on the blood-stained
field of Pittsburg Landing there was one name that was very dear in
the hearts of the patriotic people of St.Paul,--a name that was as
dear to the people of St.Paul as was the memory of the immortal
Ellsworth to the people of Chicago.William Henry Acker, while
marching at the head of his company, with uplifted sword and with
voice and action urging on his comrades to the thickest of the fray,
was pierced in the forehead by a rebel bullet and fell dead upon the
ill-fated field.Acker was advised by his comrades not
to wear his full uniform, as he was sure to be a target for rebel
bullets, but the captain is said to have replied that if he had to die
he would die with his harness on.Soon after forming his command into
line, and when they had advanced only a few yards, he was singled out
by a rebel sharpshooter and instantly killed--the only man in the."Loved, almost adored, by the
company," says one of them, writing of the sad event, "Capt.Acker's
fall cast a deep shadow of gloom over his command."With a last look at their dead commander, and with the
watchword 'this for our captain,' volley after volley from their guns
carried death into the ranks of his murderers.From that moment but
one feeling seemed to possess his still living comrades--that of
revenge for the death of their captain.How terribly they carried out
that purpose the number of rebel slain piled around the vicinity of
his body fearfully attest.Acker was a very severe blow to
his relatives and many friends in this city.No event thus far in the
history of the Rebellion had brought to our doors such a realizing
sense of the sad realities of the terrible havoc wrought upon the
battlefield.A noble life had been sacrificed in the cause of
freedom--one more name had been added to the long death roll of the
nation's heroes.Acker was born a soldier--brave, able, popular and
courteous--and had he lived would undoubtedly been placed high in rank
long before the close of the rebellion.No person ever went to the
front in whom the citizens of St.Paul had more hope for a brilliant
future.He was born in New York State in 1833, and was twenty-eight
years of age at the time of his death.Paul in 1854 and
commenced the study of law in the office of his brother-in-law, Hon.He did not remain long in the law business, however, but
soon changed to a position in the Bank of Minnesota, which had just
been established by ex-Gov.For some time he was captain of
the Pioneer Guards, a company which he was instrumental in forming,
and which was the finest military organization in the West at
that time.In 1860 he was chosen commander of the Wide-Awakes, a
marching-club, devoted to the promotion of the candidacy of Abraham
Lincoln, and many of the men he so patiently drilled during that
exciting campaign became officers in the volunteer service in that
great struggle that soon followed.Little did the captain imagine at
that time that the success of the man whose cause he espoused would so
soon be the means of his untimely death.At the breaking out of the
war Capt.Acker was adjutant general of the State of Minnesota, but he
thought he would be of more use to his country in active service and
resigned that position and organized a company for the First Minnesota
regiment, of which he was made captain.At the first battle of Bull
Run he was wounded, and for his gallant action was made captain in
the Seventeenth United States Regulars, an organization that had
been recently created by act of congress.The Sixteenth regiment was
attached to Buell's army, and participated in the second day's battle,
and Cat.Acker was one of the first to fall on that terrible day,
being shot in the identical spot in the forehead where he was wounded
at the first battle of Bull Run.As soon as the news was received in
St.Paul of the captain's death his father, Hon.Henry Acker, left for
Pittsburg Landing, hoping to be able to recover the remains of his
martyred son and bring the body back to St.His body was easily
found, his burial place having been carefully marked by members of the
Second Minnesota who arrived on the battleground a short time after
the battle.Paul they were met at
the steamboat landing by a large number of citizens and escorted to
Masonic hall, where they rested till the time of the funeral.The
funeral obsequies were held at St.Paul's church on Sunday, May 4,
1862, and were attended by the largest concourse of citizens that
had ever attended a funeral in St.Paul, many being present from
Minneapolis, St.The respect shown to the
memory of Capt.Acker was universal, and of a character which fully
demonstrated the high esteem in which he was held by the people of St.When the first Grand Army post was formed in St.Paul a name
commemorative of one of Minnesota's fallen heroes was desired for the
organization.Out of the long list of martyrs Minnesota gave to the
cause of the Union no name seemed more appropriate than that of the
heroic Capt.Acker, and it was unanimously decided that the first
association of Civil war veterans in this city should be known as
Acker post.*       *       *       *       *

The terrible and sensational news that Abraham Lincoln had been
assassinated, which was flashed over the wires on the morning of
April 15, 1865 (forty years ago yesterday), was the most appalling
announcement that had been made during the long crisis through which
the country had just passed.No tongue
could find language sufficiently strong to express condemnation of the
fiendish act.It was not
safe for any one to utter a word against the character of the martyred
president.At no place in the entire country was the terrible calamity
more deeply felt than in St.All public and private buildings
were draped in mourning.The
services at the little House of Hope church on Walnut street will long
be remembered by all those who were there.The church was heavily
draped in mourning.It had been suddenly transformed from a house of
hope to a house of sorrow, a house of woe.The pastor of the church
was the Rev.He was one of the most eloquent and
learned divines in the city--fearless, forcible and aggressive--the
Henry Ward Beecher of the Northwest.The members of the House of Hope were intensely patriotic.Many of
their number were at the front defending their imperiled country.Scores and scores of times during the desperate conflict had the
eloquent pastor of this church delivered stirring addresses favoring
a vigorous prosecution of the war.During the darkest days of the
Rebellion, when the prospect of the final triumph of the cause of the
Union seemed furthest off, Mr.Noble never faltered; he believed that
the cause was just and that right would finally triumph.When the
terrible and heart-rending news was received that an assassin's bullet
had ended the life of the greatest of all presidents the effect was
so paralyzing that hearts almost ceased beating.Every member of the
congregation felt as if one of their own household had been suddenly
taken from them.The services at the church on the Sunday morning
following the assassination were most solemn and impressive.The
little edifice was crowded almost to suffication, and when the pastor
was seen slowly ascending the pulpit, breathless silence prevailed.He
was pale and haggard, and appeared to be suffering great mental agony.With bowed head and uplifted hands, and with a voice trembling with
almost uncontrollable emotion, he delivered one of the most fervent
and impressive invocations ever heard by the audience.Had the dead
body of the president been placed in front of the altar, the solemnity
of the occasion could not have been greater.In the discourse that
followed, Mr.Noble briefly sketched the early history of the
president, and then devoted some time to the many grand deeds he had
accomplished during the time he had been in the presidential chair.For more than four years he had patiently and anxiously watched the
progress of the terrible struggle, and now, when victory was in sight,
when it was apparent to all that the fall of Richmond, the surrender
of Lee and the probable surrender of Johnston would end the long war,
he was cruelly stricken down by the hand of an assassin."With malice
towards none and with charity to all, and with firmness for the right,
as God gives us to see the right," were utterances then fresh from the
president's lips.To strike down such a man at such a time was indeed
a crime most horrible.There was scarcely a dry eye in the audience.It was supposed at the time that Secretary
of State Seward had also fallen a victim of the assassin's dagger.It was the purpose of the conspirators to murder the president, vice
president and entire cabinet, but in only one instance did the attempt
prove fatal.Secretary Seward was the foremost statesmen of the
time.His diplomatic skill had kept the country free from foreign
entanglements during the long and bitter struggle.He, too, was
eulogized by the minister, and it rendered the occasion doubly
mournful.Since that time two other presidents have been mercilessly slain by
the hand of an assassin, and although the shock to the country was
terrible, it never seemed as if the grief was as deep and universal
as when the bullet fired by John Wilkes Booth pierced the temple of
Abraham Lincoln.AN ALLEGORICAL HOROSCOPE

       *       *       *       *       *

IN TWO CHAPTERS.*       *       *       *       *

CHAPTER I.--AN OPTIMISTIC FORECAST.As the sun was gently receding in the western horizon on a beautiful
summer evening nearly a century ago, a solitary voyageur might have
been seen slowly ascending the sinuous stream that stretches from the
North Star State to the Gulf of Mexico.He was on a mission of peace
and good will to the red men of the distant forest.On nearing the
shore of what is now a great city the lonely voyageur was amazed
on discovering that the pale face of the white man had many years
preceded him.he muttered to himself; "methinks I see a
paleface toying with a dusky maiden.On
approaching near where the two were engaged in some weird incantation
the voyageur overheard the dusky maiden impart a strange message to
the paleface by her side."From the stars I see in the firmament, the
fixed stars that predominate in the configuration, I deduce the future
destiny of man.This elixer
which I now do administer to thee has been known to our people for
countless generations.The possession of it will enable thee to
conquer all thine enemies.Thou now beholdest, O Robert, the ground
upon which some day a great city will be erected.Thou art destined to
become the mighty chief of this great metropolis.Thy reign will be
long and uninterrupted.Thou wert born when the conjunction of the
planets did augur a life of perfect beatitude.As the years roll
away the inhabitants of the city will multiply with great rapidity.Questions of great import regarding the welfare of the people will
often come before thee for adjustment.To be successful In thy calling
thou must never be guilty of having decided convictions on any
subject, as thy friends will sometimes be pitted against each other in
the advocacy of their various schemes.Thou must not antagonize either
side by espousing the other's cause, but must always keep the rod and
the gun close by thy side, so that when these emergencies arise and
thou doth scent danger in the air thou canst quietly withdraw from the
scene of action and chase the festive bison over the distant prairies
or revel in piscatorial pleasure on the placid waters of a secluded
lake until the working majority hath discovered some method of
relieving thee of the necessity of committing thyself, and then, O
Robert.thou canst return and complacently inform the disappointed
party that the result would have been far different had not thou been
called suddenly away.Thou canst thus preserve the friendship of all
parties, and their votes are more essential to thee than the mere
adoption of measures affecting the prosperity of thy people.When the
requirements of the people of thy city become too great for thee alone
to administer to all their wants, the great family of Okons, the
lineal descendants of the sea kings from the bogs of Tipperary, will
come to thy aid.Take friendly counsel with them, as to incur their
displeasure will mean thy downfall.Let all the ends thou aimest at be
to so dispose of the offices within thy gift that the Okons, and the
followers of the Okons, will be as fixed in their positions as are the
stars in their orbits."After delivering this strange astrological exhortation the dusky
maiden slowly retreated toward the entrance of a nearby cavern, the
paleface meandered forth to survey the ground of his future greatness
and the voyageur resumed his lonely journey toward the setting sun.*       *       *       *       *

CHAPTER II.--A TERRIBLE REALITY.After the lapse of more than four score of years the voyageur from the
frigid North returned from his philanthropic visit to the red man.A
wonderful change met the eye.A transformation as magnificent as it
was bewildering had occurred.The same grand old bluffs looked proudly
down upon the Father of Water.The same magnificent river pursued
its unmolested course toward the boundless ocean.The hostile warrior no longer impeded the onward march of
civilization, and cultivated fields abounded on every side.Steamers were hourly traversing the translucent waters of the great
Mississippi; steam and electricity were carrying people with the
rapidity of lightning in every direction; gigantic buildings appeared
on the earth's surface, visible in either direction as far as the
eye could reach; on every corner was a proud descendant of Erin's
nobility, clad in gorgeous raiment, who had been branded "St.Paul's
finest" before leaving the shores of his native land.In the midst of
this great city was a magnificent building, erected by the generosity
of its people, in which the paleface, supported on either side by the
Okons, was the high and mighty ruler.The Okons and the followers of
the Okons were in possession of every office within the gift of the
paleface.Floating proudly from the top of this great building was an
immense banner, on which was painted in monster letters the talismanic
words: "For mayor, 1902, Robert A. Smith," Verily the prophecy of the
dusky maiden had been fulfilled.The paleface had become impregnably
intrenched.The Okons could never be dislodged.With feelings of unutterable anguish at the omnipresence of the Okons,
the aged voyageur quietly retraced his footsteps and was never more
seen by the helpless and overburdened subjects of the paleface.*       *       *       *       *

When I was about twelve years of age I resided in a small village in
one of the mountainous and sparsely settled sections of the northern
part of Pennsylvania.It was before the advent of the railroad and telegraph in that
locality.The people were not blessed with prosperity as it is known
to-day.Neither were they gifted with the intellectual attainments
possessed by the inhabitants of the same locality at the present time.Many of the old men served in the war of 1812, and they were looked up
to with about the same veneration as are the heroes of the Civil War
to-day.It was at a time when the younger generation was beginning to
acquire a thirst for knowledge, but it was not easily obtained under
the peculiar conditions existing at that period.A school district
that was able to support a school for six months in each year was
indeed considered fortunate, but even in these the older children were
not permitted to attend during the summer months, as their services
were considered indispensable in the cultivation of the soil.Reading, writing and arithmetic were about all the studies pursued in
those rural school districts, although occasionally some of the better
class of the country maidens could be seen listlessly glancing over a
geography or grammar, but they were regarded as "stuck up," and the
other pupils thought they were endeavoring to master something far
beyond their capacity.Our winter school term generally commenced the first week in December
and lasted until the first week in March, with one evening set apart
each week for a spelling-match and recitation.We had our spelling
match on Saturday nights, and every four weeks we would meet with
schools in other districts in a grand spelling contest.I was
considered too young to participate in any of the joint spelling
matches, and my heart was heavy within me every time I saw a great
four-horse sleigh loaded with joyful boys and girls on their way to
one of the great contests.One Saturday night there was to be a grand spelling match at a country
crossroad about four miles from our village, and four schools were to
participate.As I saw the great sleigh loaded for the coming struggle
the thought occurred to me that if I only managed to secure a ride
without being observed I might in some way be able to demonstrate to
the older scholars that in spelling at least I was their equal.While
the driver was making a final inspection of the team preparatory to
starting I managed to crawl under his seat, where I remained as quiet
as mouse until the team arrived at the point of destination.I had not
considered the question of getting back--I left that to chance.As
soon as the different schools had arrived two of the best spellers
were selected to choose sides, and it happened that neither of them
was from our school.I stood in front of the old-fashioned fire-place
and eagerly watched the pupils as they took their places in the line.They were drawn in the order of their reputation as spellers.When
they had finished calling the names I was still standing by the
fireplace, and I thought my chance was hopeless.The school-master
from our district noticed my woebegone appearance, and he arose from
his seat and said:

"That boy standing by the fireplace is one of the best spellers in our
school."My name was then reluctantly called, and I took my place at the
foot of the column.I felt very grateful towards our master for his
compliment and I thought I would be able to hold my position in the
line long enough to demonstrate that our master was correct.The
school-master from our district was selected to pronounce the words,
and I inwardly rejoiced.After going down the line several times and a number of scholars had
fallen on some simple word the school-master pronounced the word
"phthisic."My heart leaped as the word fell from the school-master's
lips.It was one of my favorite hard words and was not in the spelling
book.It had been selected so as to floor the entire line in order to
make way for the exercises to follow.As I looked over the long line of overgrown country boys and girls I
felt sure that none of them would be able to correctly spell the word.said the school-master, and my pulse beat
faster and faster as the older scholars ahead of me were relegated to
their seats.As the school-master stood directly in front of me and said "Next," I
could see by the twinkle in his eye that he thought I could correctly
spell the word.With a clear and
distinct voice loud enough to be heard by every one in the room
I spelled out "ph-th-is-ic--phthisic.""Correct," said the
school-master, and all the scholars looked aghast at my promptness.I shall never forget the kindly smile of the old school-master, as he
laid the spelling book upon the teacher's desk, with the quiet remark:
"I told you he could spell."I had spelled down four schools, and my
reputation as a speller was established.Our school was declared to
have furnished the champion speller of the four districts, and ever
after my name was not the last one to be called.On my return home I was not compelled to ride under the driver's seat.HALF A CENTURY WITH THE PIONEER PRESS.Pioneer Press, April 18, 1908:--Frank Moore, superintendent of the
composing room if the Pioneer Press, celebrated yesterday the fiftieth
anniversary of his connection with the paper.A dozen of the old
employes of the Pioneer Press entertained Mr.Moore at an informal
dinner at Magee's to celebrate the unusual event.Moore's service
on the Pioneer Press, in fact, has been longer than the Pioneer
Press itself, for he began his work on one of the newspapers which
eventually was merged into the present Pioneer Press.He has held his
present position as the head of the composing room for about forty
years.Frank Moore was fifteen years old when he came to St.Paul from Tioga
county, Pa., where he was born.He came with his brother, George W.
Moore, who was one of the owners and managers of the Minnesotian.His
brother had been East and brought the boy West with him.Moore's
first view of newspaper work was on the trip up the river to St.There had been a special election on a bond issue and on the way his
brother stopped at the various towns to got the election returns.Moore went to work for the Minnesotian on April 17, 1858, as a
printer's "devil."It is interesting in these days of water works and
telegraph to recall that among his duties was to carry water for the
office.He got it from a spring below where the Merchants hotel now
stands.Another of his jobs was to meet the boats.Whenever a steamer
whistled Mr.Moore ran to the dock to get the bundle of newspapers the
boat brought, and hurry with it back to the office.It was from these
papers that the editors got the telegraph news of the world.He also
was half the carrier staff of the paper.His territory covered all
the city above Wabasha street, but as far as he went up the hill
was College avenue and Ramsey street was his limit out West Seventh
street.When the Press absorbed the Minnesotian in 1861, Mr.Moore went with
it, and when in 1874 the Press and Pioneer were united Mr.His service has been continuous,
excepting during his service as a volunteer in the Civil war.The
Pioneer Press, with its antecedents, has been his only interest.Moore's service is notable for its length, it is still more
notable for the fact that he has grown with the paper, so that
to-day at sixty-five he is still filling his important position as
efficiently on a large modern newspaper as he filled it as a young man
when things in the Northwest, including its newspapers, were in the
beginning.Successive managements found that his services always gave
full value and recognized in him an employe of unusual loyalty and
devotion to the interests of the paper.Successive generations of
employes have found him always just the kind of man it is a pleasure
to have as a fellow workman.And now, the
tables removed, many a guest had gone away; a couple of youths _only_
were _there_ dead drunk.But then I saw you _both_ giving wanton kisses;
I am sure that there was billing enough on your part; such, _in fact_,
as no sister gives to a brother of correct conduct, but _rather such_
as some voluptuous mistress gives to the eager lover; such as we may
suppose that Phoebus did not give to Diana, but that Venus many a time
save to her own _dear_ Mars.I cried out; "whither are you taking those
transports that belong to me?On what belongs to myself, I will lay the
hand of a master, [347] These _delights_ must be in common with you and
me, _and_ with me and you; _but_ why does any third person take a share
in them?"This did I say; and what, _besides_, sorrow prompted my tongue to say;
but the red blush of shame rose on her conscious features; just as the
sky, streaked by the wife of Tithonus, is tinted with red, or the
maiden when beheld by her new-made husband; [348] just as the roses are
beauteous when mingled among their _encircling_ lilies; or when the
Moon is suffering from the enchantment of her steeds; [349] or the Assyrian
ivory [350] which the Mæonian woman has stained, [351] that from length
of time it may not turn yellow.That complexion _of hers_ was extremely
like to these, or to some one of these; and, as it happened, she never
was more beauteous _than then_.She looked towards the ground; to look
upon the ground, added a charm; sad were her features, in her sorrow was
she graceful.I had been tempted to tear her locks just as they were,
(and nicely dressed they were) and to make an attack upon her tender
cheeks.When I looked on her face, my strong arms fell powerless; by arms of
her own was my mistress defended.I, who the moment before had been so
savage, _now_, as a suppliant and of my own accord, entreated that she
would give me kisses not inferior _to those given-to my rival_.She
smiled, and with heartiness she gave me her best _kisses_; such as might
have snatched his three-forked bolts from Jove.To my misery I am _now_
tormented, lest that other person received them in equal perfection; and
I hope that those were not of this quality.[352]

Those _kisses,_ too, were far better than those which I taught her; and
she seemed to have learned something new.That they were too delightful,
is a bad sign; that so lovingly were your lips joined to mine, _and_
mine to yours.And yet, it is not at this alone that I am grieved; I do
not only complain that kisses were given; although I do complain as well
that they were given; such could never have been taught but on a closer
acquaintanceship.I know not who is the master that has received a
remuneration so ample._He laments the death of the parrot which he had given to Corinna._

|The parrot, the imitative bird [353] sent from the Indians of the East,
is dead; come in flocks to his obsequies, ye birds.Come, affectionate
denizens of air, and beat your breasts with your wings; and with your
hard claws disfigure your delicate features.Let your rough feathers be
torn in place of your sorrowing hair; instead of the long trumpet, [354]
let your songs resound.Why, Philomela, are you complaining of the cruelty of _Tereus,_ the
Ismarian tyrant?_Surely,_ that grievance is worn out by its _length of_
years.Turn your attention to the sad end of a bird so prized.It is
is a great cause of sorrow, but, _still,_ that so old.All, who poise
yourselves in your career in the liquid air; but you, above the rest,
affectionate turtle-dove, [360] lament him.Throughout life there was a
firm attachment between you, and your prolonged and lasting friendship
endured to the end.What the Phocian youth [361] was to the Argive
Orestes, the same, parrot, was the turtle-dove to you, so long as it was
allowed _by fate._

But what _matters_ that friendship?What the beauty of your rare
plumage?What your voice so ingenious at imitating sounds?What
avails it that _ever_ since you were given, you pleased my mistress?Unfortunate pride of _all_ birds, you are indeed laid low.With your
feathers you could outvie the green emerald, having your purple beak
tinted with the ruddy saffron.There was no bird on earth more skilled
at imitating sounds; so prettily [362] did you utter words with your
lisping notes.Through envy, you were snatched away _from us_: you were the cause of
no cruel wars; you were a chatterer, and the lover of peaceful concord.See, the quails, amid _all_ their battles, [363] live on; perhaps, too,
for that reason, they become old.With a very little you were satisfied;
and, through your love of talking, you could not give time to your mouth
for much food.A nut was your food, and poppies the cause of sleep; and
a drop of pure water used to dispel your thirst.The gluttonous vulture
lives on, the kite, too, that forms its circles in the air, and the
jackdaw, the foreboder [364] of the shower of rain.The crow, too, lives
on, hateful to the armed Minerva; [366] it, indeed, will hardly die
after nine ages.[367] The prattling parrot is dead, the mimic of the
human voice, sent as a gift from the ends of the earth.What is best,
is generally first carried off by greedy hands; what is worthless, fills
its _destined_ numbers.[368] Thersites was the witness of the lamented
death of him from Phylax; and now Hector became ashes, while his
brothers _yet_ lived.Why should I mention the affectionate prayers of my anxious mistress in
your behalf; prayers borne over the seas by the stormy North wind?The
seventh day was come, [369] that was doomed to give no morrow; and now
stood your Destiny, with her distaff all uncovered.And yet your words
did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died, your tongue
cried aloud, "Corinna, farewell!"[370]

At the foot of the Elysian hill [371] a grove, overshaded with dark holm
oaks, and the earth, moist with never-dying grass, is green.If there
is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of
innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled.There range far
and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole
bird _of its kind.There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers;
the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate.Received in this home
in the groves, amid these the Parrot attracts the guileless birds by his
words.[372]

A sepulchre covers his bones; a sepulchre small as his body; on which a
little stone has _this_ inscription, well suited to itself: "From this
very tomb [377] I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress.I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds."_He attempts to convince his mistress, who suspects the contrary, that
he is not in love with her handmaid Cypassis._

|Am I then [378] 'to be for ever made the object of accusation by new
charges?Though I should conquer, _yet_ I am tired of entering the
combat so oft.Do I look up to the _very_ top of the marble theatre,
from the multitude, you choose some woman, from whom to receive a cause
of grief.Or does some beauteous fair look on me with inexpressive
features; you find out that there are secret signs on the features.Do
I praise any one; with your nails you attack her ill-starred locks; if
I blame any one, you think I am hiding some fault.If my colour is
healthy, _then I am pronounced_ to be indifferent towards you; if
unhealthy, _then_ I am said to be dying with love for another.But
I _only_ wish I was conscious to myself of some fault; those endure
punishment with equanimity, who are deserving of it.Now you accuse
me without cause; and by believing every thing at random, you yourself
forbid your anger to be of any consequence.See how the long-eared ass,
[379] in his wretched lot, walks leisurely along, _although_ tyrannized
over with everlasting blows.a fresh charge; Cypassis, so skilled at tiring, [380] is
blamed for having been the supplanter of her mistress.May the Gods
prove more favourable, than that if I should have any inclination for
a faux pas, a low-born mistress of a despised class should attract me!What free man would wish to have amorous intercourse with a bondwoman,
and to embrace a body mangled with the whip?[387] Add, _too_, that she
is skilled in arranging your hair, and is a valuable servant to you for
the skill of her hands.And would I, forsooth, ask _such a thing_ of a
servant, who is so faithful to you?Only that a refusal
might be united to a betrayal?I swear by Venus, and by the bow of the
winged boy, that I am accused of a crime which I never committed._He wonders how Corinna has discovered his intrigue with Cypassis, her
handmaid, and tells the latter how ably he has defended her and himself
to her mistress._

|Cypassis, perfect in arranging the hair in a thousand fashions, but
deserving to adorn the Goddesses alone; discovered, too, by me, in our
delightful intrigue, to be no novice; useful, indeed, to your mistress,
but still more serviceable to myself; who, _I wonder_, was the informant
of our stolen caresses?"Whence was Corinna made acquainted with your
escapade?Is it that, making a slip in any
expression, I have given any guilty sign of our stealthy amours?And
have I _not_, too, declared that if any one can commit the sin with a
bondwoman, that man must want a sound mind?The Thessalian was inflamed by the beauty of the captive daughter of
Brises; the slave priestess of Phoebus was beloved by the general from
Mycenæ.I am not greater than the descendant of Tantalus, nor greater
than Achilles; why should I deem that a disgrace to me, which was
becoming for monarchs?But when she fixed her angry eyes upon you, I saw you blushing all
over your cheeks.But, if, perchance, you remember, with how much more
presence of mind did I myself make oath by the great Godhead of Venus!Do thou, Goddess, do thou order the warm South winds to bear away over
the Carpathian ocean [388] the perjuries of a mind unsullied.In return
for these services, swarthy Cypassis, [389] give me a sweet reward,
your company to-day.Why refuse me, ungrateful one, and why invent new
apprehensions?'Tis enough to have laid one of your superiors under an
obligation.But if, in your folly, you refuse me, as the informer, I
will tell what has taken place before; and I myself will be the betrayer
of my own failing.And I will tell Cypassis, in what spots I have met
you, and how often, and in ways how many and what._To Cupid._

O Cupid, never angered enough against me, O boy, that hast taken up thy
abode in my heart!why dost thou torment me, who, _thy_ soldier, have
never deserted thy standards?And _why_, in my own camp, am I _thus_
wounded?Why does thy torch burn, thy bow pierce, thy friends?'Twere a
greater glory to conquer those who war _with thee_.Nay more, did not
the Hæmonian hero, afterwards, relieve him, when wounded, with his
healing aid, whom he had struck with his spear.[390] The hunter follows
_the prey_ that flies, that which is caught he leaves behind; and he is
ever on the search for still more than he has found.We, a multitude
devoted to thee, are _too well_ acquainted with thy arms; _yet_ thy
tardy hand slackens against the foe that resists.Of what use is it to
be blunting thy barbed darts against bare bones?_for_ Love has left my
bones _quite_ bare.Many a man is there free from Love, many a damsel,
too, free from Love; from these, with great glory, may a triumph be
obtained by thee.Rome, had she not displayed her strength over the boundless earth,
would, even to this day, have been planted thick with cottages of
thatch.[391] The invalid soldier is drafted off to the fields [392]
that he has received; the horse, when free from the race, [393] is sent
into the pastures; the lengthened docks conceal the ship laid up; and
the wand of repose [394] is demanded, the sword laid by.It were
time for me, too, who have served so oft in love for the fair, now
discharged, to be living in quiet._And yet_, if any Divinity were to say to me, 'Live on, resigning love
I should decline it; so sweet an evil are the fair.When I am quite
exhausted, and the passion has faded from my mind, I know not by what
perturbation of my wretched feelings I am bewildered.Just as the horse
that is hard of mouth bears his master headlong, as he vainly pulls in
the reins covered with foam; just as a sudden gale, the land now nearly
made, carries out to sea the vessel, as she is entering harbour; so,
many a time, does the uncertain gale of Cupid bear me away, and rosy
Love resumes his well-known weapons.Pierce me, boy; naked am I exposed
to thee, my arms laid aside; hither let thy strength be _directed_:
here thy right hand tells _with effect_.Here, as though bidden, do thy
arrows now spontaneously come; in comparison to myself, their own quiver
is hardly so well known to them.Wretched is he who endures to rest the whole night, and who calls
slumber a great good.Fool, what is slumber but the image of cold death?The Fates will give abundance of time for taking rest.Only let the words of my deceiving mistress beguile me; in hoping,
at least, great joys shall I experience.And sometimes let her use
caresses; sometimes let her find fault; oft may I enjoy _the favour_ of
my mistress; often may I be repulsed.That Mars is one so dubious,
is through thee, his step-son, Cupid; and after thy example does thy
step-father wield his arms.Thou art fickle, and much more wavering
than thy own wings; and thou both dost give and refuse thy joys at thy
uncertain caprice.Still if thou dost listen to me, as I entreat thee,
with thy beauteous mother; hold a sway never to be relinquished in my
heart.May the damsels, a throng too flighty _by far_, be added to thy
realms; then by two peoples wilt thou be revered._He tells Græcinus how he is in love with two mistresses at the same
time._

|Thou wast wont to tell me, Græcinus [395] (I remember well), 'twas
thou, I am sure, that a person cannot be in love with two females at the
same time.Through thee have I been deceived; through thee have I been
caught without my arms.to my shame, I am in love with two at
the same moment.Both of them are charming; both most attentive to their
dress; in skill, 'tis a matter of doubt, whether the one or the other is
superior.That one is more beauteous than this; this one, too, is more
beauteous than that; and this one pleases me the most, and that one the
most.The one passion and the other fluctuate, like the skiff, [397]
impelled by the discordant breezes, and keep me distracted.Why,
Erycina, dost thou everlastingly double my pangs?Was not one damsel
sufficient for my anxiety?Why add leaves to the trees, why stars to the
heavens filled _with them?_ Why additional waters to the vast ocean?But still this is better, than if I were languishing without a flame;
may a life of seriousness be the lot of my foes.May it be the lot of
my foes to sleep in the couch of solitude, and to recline their limbs
outstretched in the midst of the bed.But, for me, may cruel Love _ever_
disturb my sluggish slumbers; and may I be not the solitary burden of
my couch.May my mistress, with no one to hinder it, make me die _with
love_, if one is enough to be able to do so; _but_ if one is not enough,
_then_ two.Limbs that are thin, [401] but not without strength, may
suffice; flesh it is, not sinew that my body is in want of.Delight,
too, will give resources for vigour to my sides; through me has no fair
ever been deceived.Often, robust through the hours of delicious night,
have I proved of stalwart body, even in the mom.Happy the man, who
proves the delights of Love?Oh that the Gods would grant that to be the
cause of my end!Let the soldier arm his breast [402] that faces the opposing darts, and
with his blood let him purchase eternal fame.Let the greedy man seek
wealth; and with forsworn mouth, let the shipwrecked man drink of the
seas which he has wearied with ploughing them.But may it be my lot to
perish in the service of Love: _and_, when I die, may I depart in the
midst of his battles; [403] and may some one say, when weeping at my
funeral rites: "Such was a fitting death for his life."_He endeavours to dissuade Corinna from her voyage to Baiæ._

|The pine, cut on the heights of Pelion, was the first to teach the
voyage full of danger, as the waves of the ocean wondered: which, boldly
amid the meeting rocks, [404] bore away the ram remarkable for his
yellow fleece.would that, overwhelmed, the Argo had drunk of the
fatal waves, so that no one might plough the wide main with the oar.Corinna flies from both the well-known couch, and the Penates of
her home, and prepares to go upon the deceitful paths _of the ocean_.why, for you, must I dread the Zephyrs, and the Eastern
gales, and the cold Boreas, and the warm wind of the South?There no
cities will you admire, _there_ no groves; _ever_ the same is the azure
appearance of the perfidious main.The midst of the ocean has no tiny shells, or tinted pebbles; [405] that
is the recreation [406] of the sandy shore.The shore _alone_, ye fair,
should be pressed with your marble feet.Thus far is it safe; the rest
of _that_ path is full of hazard.And let others tell you of the warfare
of the winds: the waves which Scylla infests, or those which Charybdis
_haunts_: from what rocky range the deadly Ceraunia projects: in what
gulf the Syrtes, or in what Malea [407] lies concealed.Of these let
others tell: but do you believe what each of them relates: no storm
injures the person who credits them.After a length of time _only_ is the land beheld once more, when, the
cable loosened, the curving ship runs out upon the boundless main: where
the anxious sailor dreads the stormy winds, and _sees_ death as near
him, as he sees the waves.What if Triton arouses the agitated waves?How parts the colour, then, from all your face!Then you may invoke the
gracious stars of the fruitful Leda: [409] and may say, 'Happy she, whom
her own _dry_ land receives!'Tis far more safe to lie snug in the couch,
[410] to read amusing books, [411] _and_ to sound with one's fingers the
Thracian lyre.But if the headlong gales bear away my unavailing words, still may
Galatea be propitious to your ship.The loss of such a damsel, both ye
Goddesses, daughters of Nereus, and thou, father of the Nereids, would
be a reproach to you.Go, mindful of me, on your way, _soon_ to return
with favouring breezes: may that, a stronger gale, fill your sails.Then may the mighty Nereus roll the ocean towards this shore: in this
direction may the breezes blow: hither may the tide impel the waves.Do
you yourself entreat, that the Zephyrs may come full upon your canvass:
do you let out the swelling sails with your own hand.I shall be the first, from the shore, to see the well-known ship, and
I shall exclaim, "'Tis she that carries my Divinities: [412] and I will
receive you in my arms, and will ravish, indiscriminately, many a kiss;
the victim, promised for your return, shall fall; the soft sand shall
be heaped, too, in the form of a couch; and some sand-heap shall be as a
table [413] _for us_.There, with wine placed before us, you shall tell
many a story, how your bark was nearly overwhelmed in the midst of the
waves: and how, while you were hastening to me, you dreaded neither the
hours of the dangerous night, nor yet the stormy Southern gales.Though
they be fictions, [414] _yet_ all will I believe as truth; why should
I not myself encourage what is my own wish?May Lucifer, the most
brilliant in the lofty skies, speedily bring me that day, spurring on
his steed."_He rejoices in the possession of his mistress, having triumphed over
every obstacle._

|Come, triumphant laurels, around my temples; I am victorious: lo!in my
bosom Corinna is; she, whom her husband, whom a keeper, whom a door _so_
strong, (so many foes!)were watching, that she might by no stratagem
be taken.This victory is deserving of an especial triumph: in which the
prize, such as it is, is _gained_ without bloodshed.Not lowly walls,
not towns surrounded with diminutive trenches, but a _fair_ damsel has
been taken by my contrivance.When Pergamus fell, conquered in a war of twice five years: [415] out of
so many, how great was the share of renown for the son of Atreus?But
my glory is undivided, and shared in by no soldier: and no other has
the credit of the exploit.Myself the general, myself the troops, I have
attained this end of my desires: I, myself, have been the cavalry, I
the infantry, I, the standard-bearer _too_.Fortune, too, has mingled
no hazard with my feats.Come hither, _then_, thou Triumph, gained by
exertions _entirely_ my own.And the cause [416] of my warfare is no new one; had not the daughter
of Tyndarus been carried off, there would have been peace between Europe
and Asia.A female disgracefully set the wild Lapithæ and the two-formed
race in arms, when the wine circulated.A female again, [417] good
Latinus, forced the Trojans to engage in ruthless warfare, in thy
realms.'Twas the females, [421] when even now the City was but new,
that sent against the Romans their fathers-in-law, and gave them cruel
arms.I have beheld the bulls fighting for a snow-white mate: the
heifer, herself the spectator, afforded fresh courage.Me, too, with
many others, but still without bloodshed, has Cupid ordered to bear the
standard in his service._He entreats the aid of Isis and Lucina in behalf of Corinna, in her
labour._

|While Corinna, in her imprudence, is trying to disengage the burden of
her pregnant womb, exhausted, she lies prostrate in danger of her life.She, in truth, who incurred so great a risk unknown to me, is worthy
of my wrath; but anger falls before apprehension.But yet, by me it was
that she conceived; or so I think.That is often as a fact to me, which
is possible.Isis, thou who dost [422] inhabit Parætonium, [423] and the genial
fields of Canopus, [424] and Memphis, [425] and palm-bearing Pharos,
[426] and where the rapid.Nile, discharged from its vast bed, rushes
through its seven channels into the ocean waves; by thy'sistra' [428]
do I entreat thee; by the faces, _too_, of revered Anubis; [429] and
then may the benignant Osiris [430] ever love thy rites, and may the
sluggish serpent [431] ever wreath around thy altars, and may the horned
Apis [432] walk in the procession as thy attendant; turn hither thy
features, [433] and in one have mercy upon two; for to my mistress wilt
thou be giving life, she to me.Full many a time in thy honour has she
sat on thy appointed days, [434] on which [435] the throng of the Galli
[436] wreathe _themselves_ with thy laurels.[437]

Thou, too, who dost have compassion on the females who are in labour,
whose latent burden distends their bodies slowly moving; come,
propitious Ilithyia, [438] and listen to my prayers.She is worthy for
thee to command to become indebted to thee.I, myself, in white array,
will offer frankincense at thy smoking altars; I, myself, will
offer before thy feet the gifts that I have vowed.I will add _this_
inscription too; "Naso, for the preservation of Corinna, _offers
these_."But if, amid apprehensions so great, I may be allowed to give
you advice, let it suffice for you, Corinna, to have struggled in this
_one_ combat._He reproaches his mistress for having attempted to procure abortion._

|Of what use is it for damsels to live at ease, exempt from war, and
not with their bucklers, [439] to have any inclination to follow the
bloodstained troops; if, without warfare, they endure wounds from
weapons of their own, and arm their imprudent hands for their own
destruction?She who was the first to teach how to destroy the tender
embryo, was deserving to perish by those arms of her own.That the
stomach, forsooth, may be without the reproach of wrinkles, the sand
must [440] be lamentably strewed for this struggle of yours.If the same custom had pleased the matrons of old, through _such_
criminality mankind would have perished; and he would be required, who
should again throw stones [441] on the empty earth, for the second time
the original of our kind.Who would have destroyed the resources
of Priam, if Thetis, the Goddess of the waves, had refused to bear
_Achilles_, her due burden?If Ilia had destroyed [442] the twins in her
swelling womb, the founder of the all-ruling City would have perished.If Venus had laid violent hands on Æneas in her pregnant womb, the earth
would have been destitute of _its_ Cæsars.You, too, beauteous one,
might have died at the moment you might have been born, if your mother
had tried the same experiment which you have done.I, myself, though
destined as I am, to die a more pleasing death by love, should have
beheld no days, had my mother slain me.Why do you deprive the loaded vine of its growing grapes?And why pluck
the sour apples with relentless hand?When ripe, let them fall of their
own accord; _once_ put forth, let them grow.Life is no slight reward
for a little waiting.Why pierce [443] your own entrails, by applying
instruments, and _why_ give dreadful poisons to the _yet_ unborn?People
blame the Colchian damsel, stained with the blood of her sons; and they
grieve for Itys, Slaughtered by his own mother.Each mother was cruel;
but each, for sad reasons, took vengeance on her husband, by shedding
their common blood.Tell me what Tereus, or what Jason excites you to
pierce your body with an anxious hand?This neither the tigers do in their Armenian dens, [444] nor does the
lioness dare to destroy an offspring of her own.But, delicate females
do this, not, however, with impunity; many a time [445] does she die
herself, who kills her _offspring_ in the womb.She dies herself, and,
with her loosened hair, is borne upon the bier; and those whoever only
catch a sight of her, cry "She deserved it."[446] But let these words
vanish in the air of the heavens, and may there be no weight in _these_
presages of mine.Ye forgiving Deities, allow her this once to do wrong
with safety _to herself_; that is enough; let a second transgression
bring _its own_ punishment._He addresses a ring which he has presented to his mistress, and envi
its happy lot._

|O ring, [447] about to encircle the finger of the beauteous fair, in
which there is nothing of value but the affection of the giver; go as a
pleasing gift; _and_ receiving you with joyous feelings, may she at once
place you upon her finger.May you serve her as well as she is constant
to me; and nicely fitting, may you embrace her finger in your easy
circle.Happy ring, by my mistress will you be handled.To my sorrow, I
am now envying my own presents.that I could suddenly be changed into my own present, by the arts of
her of Ææa, or of the Carpathian old man![448] Then could I wish you
to touch the bosom of my mistress, and for her to place her left hand
within her dress.Though light and fitting well, I would escape from
her finger; and loosened by _some_ wondrous contrivance, into her bosom
would I fall.I too, _as well_, that I might be able to seal [449] her
secret tablets, and that the seal, neither sticky nor dry, might not
drag the wax, should first have to touch the lips [450] of the charming
fair.Only I would not seal a note, the cause of grief to myself.Should
I be given, to be put away in her desk, [459] I would refuse to depart,
sticking fast to your fingers with ray contracted circle.To you, my life, I would never be a cause of disgrace, or a burden
which your delicate fingers would refuse to carry.Wear me, when you
are bathing your limbs in the tepid stream; and put up with the
inconvenience of the water getting beneath the stone.But, I doubt, that
_on seeing you_ naked, my passion would be aroused; and that, a ring, I
should enact the part of the lover._But_ why wish for impossibilities?Go, my little gift; let her understand that my constancy is proffered
with you._He enlarges on the beauties of his native place, where he is now
staying; but, notwithstanding the delights of the country, he says that
he cannot feel happy in the absence of his mistress, whom he invites to
visit him._

|Sulmo, [460] the third part of the Pelignian land, [461] _now_ receives
me; a little spot, but salubrious with its flowing streams.Though the
Sun should cleave the earth with his approaching rays, and though the
oppressive Constellation [462] of the Dog of Icarus should shine, the
Pelignian fields are traversed by flowing streams, and the shooting
grass is verdant on the soft ground.The earth is fertile in corn, and
much more fruitful in the grape; the thin soil [463] produces, too, the
olive, that bears its berries.[464] The rivers also trickling amid the
shooting blades, the grassy turfs cover the moistened ground.In one word, I am mistaken; she who excites
my flame is far off; my flame is here.I would not choose, could I be
placed between Pollux and Castor,
