As it plunges into the darkness it would seem to be inevitable
that something must happen, and that, whatever happens, it must
necessarily involve both the train and every one in it in utter
and irremediable destruction.Here is a body weighing in the
neighborhood of two hundred tons, moving over the face of the earth
at a speed of sixty feet a second and held to its course only by two
slender lines of iron rails;--and yet it is safe!--We have seen how
when, half a century ago, the possibility of something remotely like
this was first discussed, a writer in the _British Quarterly_ earned
for himself a lasting fame by using the expression that "We should
as soon expect people to suffer themselves to be fired off upon
one of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as to trust themselves to the
mercy of such a machine, going at such a rate;"--while Lord Brougham
exclaimed that "the folly of seven hundred people going fifteen
miles an hour, in six trains, exceeds belief."At the time they
wrote, the chances were ninety-nine in a hundred that both reviewer
and correspondent were right; and yet, because reality, not for the
first nor the last time, saw fit to outstrip the wildest flights of
imagination, the former at least blundered, by being prudent, into
an immortality of ridicule.The thing, however, is still none the
less a miracle because it is with us matter of daily observation.That, indeed, is the most miraculous part of it.At all hours of the
day and of the night, during every season of the year, this movement
is going on.It depends for its even action
on every conceivable contingency, from the disciplined vigilance
of thousands of employ√©s to the condition of the atmosphere, the
heat of an axle, or the strength of a nail.The vast machine is in
constant motion, and the derangement of a single one of a myriad of
conditions may at any moment occasion one of those inequalities of
movement which are known as accidents.Yet at the end of the year,
of the hundreds of millions of passengers fewer have lost their
lives through these accidents than have been murdered in cold blood.Not without reason, therefore, has it been asserted that, viewing
at once the speed, the certainty, and the safety with which the
intricate movement of modern life is carried on, there is no more
creditable monument to human care, human skill, and human foresight
than the statistics of railroad accidents.Abergele, accident at, 72.Accidents, railroad, about stations, 166.

Transcriber's note: The following has been moved from the beginning
of the book to the end.=By the same Author.=


=Railroads and Railroad Questions.= 12mo, cloth, $1 25.The volume
treats of "The Genesis of the Railroad System," "Accidents," and
the "Present Railroad Problem."The author has made himself the
acknowledged authority on this group of subjects.If his book goes
only to those who are interested in the ownership, the use, or the
administration of railroads, it is sure of a large circle of readers.--_Railway World._

"Characterized by broad, progressive, liberal ideas."--_Railway
Review._

"The entire conclusions are of great value."--_N.Y.Reports of all transactions must be sent
to Colombo.A.--No remarks are necessary in regard to the introduction.B.--In elucidation of the document sent by us with regard to the
opening of the harbours of the Kandyan King, as to how far the
instructions extend and how they are to be applied within the Company's
jurisdiction, nothing need be said here, as this will be sufficiently
clear from our successive letters from Colombo.We would only state
that it would seem as if Mr.Zwaardecroon had forgotten that the
prohibition against the clandestine export of cinnamon applies also
to the export of elephants, and that these may not be sold either
directly or indirectly by any one but the Company.C.--It is not apparent that our people would be allowed to
purchase areca-nut in Trincomalee on account of the opening of
the harbours.Zwaardecroon's plan has been submitted to Their
Excellencies at Batavia, who replied in their letters of December 12,
1695, and July 3, 1696, that some success might be obtained by getting
the nuts through the Wanny from the King's territory.An experiment
might be made (provided Their Excellencies approve) charging Rds.1/3
per ammunam, as is done in Colombo, Galle, Matura, &c. This toll could
be farmed out, and the farmers authorized to collect the duty at the
passes, no further duties being imposed whether the nuts are exported
or not.If the duty were levied only on the nuts that are exported,
the inhabitants who now buy them from the Company at Rds.6 per ammunam
would no longer do so, and this profit would be lost.Whether the
duty ought to be higher than Rds.The same
rule must be applied to pepper, cotton, &c., imported at the passes,
7 1/2 per cent.[81] This being paid,
the articles may be sold here, exported, or anything done as the
inhabitants please, without further liability to duty.D.--In the proclamation referred to here, in which free trade is
permitted at all harbours in Ceylon in the Company's territory,
it is clearly stated that the harbours may be freely entered with
merchandise, provided the customary duties are paid, and that only
the subjects of the Kandyan King are exempted from the payment of
these.It does not seem to me that this rule is in agreement with
the supposition that because of this free trade the duty on foreign
and native cloth would be abolished.Zwaardecroon had made
inquiries he would have been informed that, as far as the import of
foreign cloth is concerned, the duty is the same as that in Colombo and
Galle.The proposed change would apparently bring about an increase of
the alphandigo, but where then would be found the Rds.7,1 0 as duty
on the native and foreign cloths?I cannot see on what basis this
proposal is founded, and I therefore think that the Customs duty of
20 per cent.on the imported foreign cloths and the 20 per cent.for
the stamping of native cloths must be continued when, on the 31st
December next, the lease for the duty of 25 per cent.expires, the
more so as it has been pointed out in this Memoir wherever possible
that the inhabitants are increasing in prosperity.This agrees with
what was discussed at the general Paresse.With regard to the Moorish
merchants from Bengal, there would be no objection to the duty on the
cloths imported by them being fixed at 7 1/2 per cent., because they
have to make a much longer voyage than the merchants from Coromandel
and other places on the opposite coast; while we have to humour them
in order to induce them to provide us with rice.Moreover the Bengal
cloths are not very much in demand, and these people usually ask to
be paid in elephants, which do not cost the Company very much, rather
than in cash, as has been done again by the owner of the ship that is
here at present on behalf of the Bengal Nabob Caungaarekan.He also
complained of the duty of 20 per cent.and said he would pay no more
than the Company pays in Bengal.He said his master the Nabob would
be very angry, &c. We therefore considered whether the duty could not
be reduced to 7 1/2 per cent., as may be seen in the resolutions of
June 4 last.On December 12, 1695, a letter was received from Batavia
in answer to the difficulties raised by Mr.Zwaardecroon with regard
to these impositions, in which it is said that the Customs duty for
Bengal from the date of the license for free trade should be regulated
as it had been in olden times, with authority to remove difficulties
in their way and to give them redress where necessary.I found that
the duty paid by them formerly on these cloths was 7 1/2 per cent.,
both in Galle and here, and I therefore authorize Your Honours to
levy from them only that amount.This must be kept in mind at the
farming out of these revenues at the end of the year, in order to
prevent difficulties with the farmer, as happened only lately.I
trust, however, that the farming out will not yield less than other
years.Meantime, and before any other vessels from Bengal arrive, the
approbation of Their Excellencies at Batavia must be obtained with
regard to this matter, so that alterations may be made according to
their directions without any difficulty.E.--I must confess that I do not understand how the subject of
free trade can be brought forward again as being opposed to the
Company's interests, as is done again with regard to the 24 casks
of coconut oil which the inhabitants have to deliver to the Company,
which are properly paid for and are not required for the purpose of
sale but for the use of the Company's servants, or how any one dares
to maintain that the lawful sovereign who extends his graciousness
and favours over his subjects and neighbours would be tied down and
prejudiced by such rules.It is true that the coconut trees in Matura
are required for the elephants, but in Galle and Colombo it is not so;
but the largest number of trees there is utilized for the drawing of
surie [82] for arrack, &c. It is true that some nuts are exported,
but only a small quantity, while the purchasers or transporters have
to sell one-third of what they export to the Company at Rds.2 a
thousand, while they must cost them at least Rds.Out of these we
had the oil pressed ourselves, and this went largely to supplement
the requirements for local consumption, which are very large, since
the vessels also have to be supplied, because as a matter of economy
the native harpuis (resin) has been largely used for rubbing over
the ships, so as to save the Dutch resin as much as possible, and
for the manufacture of this native resin a large quantity of oil is
required.Your Honours must therefore continue to have all suitable
casks filled with oil, and send to Colombo all that can be spared
after the required quantity has been sent to Coromandel, Trincomalee,
and Batticaloa, reserving what is necessary for the next pearl fishery
and the use of the Commandement.In order to avoid difficulties, Your
Honours are required to send to Colombo yearly (until we send orders
to the contrary) 12 casks of coconut oil and 2 casks of margosa oil,
which are expected without failure.For the rest we refer to what is
said under the heading of Coconut Trees.F.--This form for a passport was sent for no other purpose but that
it should be introduced according to instructions.G.--There is sufficient time yet for the opening of the road from
Putulang to Mantotte.I am well pleased with the work of the Dessave,
and approve of the orders given by him to the Toepas Adigar Rodrigo,
and the various reports submitted by him.In these he states that the
roads are now in good condition, while on June 5, when 34 elephants
arrived from Colombo, on this side of Putulang nothing had been done
yet, and even on July 16 and 17 when His Excellency the Governor
passed part of that road the work had advanced but very little.I
therefore sent on the 14th instant the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, who
had successfully transported the animals from Colombo to Putulang,
and is a man who can be depended upon, with two surveyors to see
that the roads, which were narrow and extraordinary crooked, were
widened to 2 roods and straightened somewhat in the forest, and to
cut roads leading to the water tanks.Sixty Wallias or wood-cutters,
150 coolies, and 25 Lascoreens were sent to complete this work, so
that in future there will be no difficulties of this kind, except
that the dry tanks must be deepened.Isaacsz on this
subject on my return.On account of his shameful neglect and lying
and for other well-known reasons I have dismissed the Adigar Domingo
Rodrigo as unworthy to serve the Company again anywhere or at any
time, and have appointed in his place Alexander Anamale, who has
been an Adigar for many years in the same place.In giving him this
appointment I as usual obtained the verbal and written opinions of
several of the Commandeurs, who stated that he had on the whole been
vigilant and diligent in his office, but was discharged last year
by the Commission from Colombo without any reasons being known here,
to make room for the said incapable Domingo Rodrigo, who was Adigar of
Ponneryn at the time.I suppose he was taken away from there to please
the Wannia chiefs Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarene,
whose eldest son Gaspar, junior, was appointed Master of the Hunt,
as stated under the heading of the Wanny and Ponneryn.With regard to
the instructions to compile various lists, this order must be carried
out in so far as they are now complete.With regard to the significant
statement that the Honourable Company does not possess any lands in
Jaffnapatam, and that there is not the smallest piece of land known
of which the Company does not receive taxes, and that it therefore
would be impossible to compile a list of lands belonging to or given
away on behalf of the Company, and in case of the latter by whom, to
whom, when, why, &c., I am at a loss to follow the reasoning, and it
seems to me that there is something wrong in it, because the protocols
at the Secretariate here show that during the years 1695, 1696, and
1697 five pieces of land were given away by Mr.Zwaardecroon himself,
and this without the least knowledge or consent of His Excellency the
Governor; while, on the other hand, I know that there are still many
fields in the Provinces which are lying waste and have never been
cultivated; so that they belong to the Company and no one else.At
present the inhabitants send their cattle to these lands to graze,
as the animals would otherwise destroy their cultivated fields,
but in the beginning all lands were thus lying waste.With a view
to find out how many more of these lands there are here, and where
they are situated, I have instructed the Thombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho,
to draw up a list of them from the newly compiled Thombo, beginning
with the two Provinces Willigamme and Waddamoraatschie, the Thombo of
which is completed; the other three Provinces must be taken up later
on.Perhaps the whole thing could be done on one sheet of paper, and
it need not take two years, nor do we want the whole Thombo in several
reams of imperial paper.Bolscho
return from their work at the road to Putulang, this work must be
taken in hand and the list submitted as soon as possible.I also do
not see the difficulty of compiling a list of all the small pieces
of land which, in the compiling of the new Thombo, were discovered on
re-survey to have been unlawfully taken possession of.Since my arrival
here I had two such lists prepared for the Provinces Willigamme and
Waddamoraatschie covering two sheets of paper each.This work was well
worth the trouble, as the pieces of cultivated land in the Province
of Willigamme amounted to 299,977 1/2 and in Waddamoraatschie to
128,013 roods, making altogether 427,990 1/2 roods.These, it is
said, might be sold to the present owners for about Rds.I
think it would be best if these lands were publicly leased out, so
that the people could show their deeds.I think this would not be
unreasonable, and consider it would be sufficient favour to them,
since they have had the use of the lands for so many years without
ever paying taxes.When the new Thombo is compiled for the Provinces
of Patchelepalle and Timmeraatsche and the six inhabited islands,
some lands will surely be discovered there also.H.--It is in compliance with instructions, and with my approbation,
that the accounts with the purchasers of elephants in Golconda and
with the Brahmin Timmerza have been settled.For various reasons which
it is not necessary to state here he is never to be employed as the
Company's broker again, the more so as the old custom of selling the
elephants by public auction has been reintroduced this year, as has
been mentioned in detail under the heading of Trade.Your Honours must comply with our orders contained in the letter
of May 4 last from Colombo, as to how the cheques from Golconda are
to be drawn up and entered in the books.With regard to the special
request of the merchants that the amount due to them might be paid in
cash or elephants through the said Timmerza to their attorneys, this
does not appear in their letter of December 7, 1696, from Golconda,
but the principal purchasers of elephants request that the Company
may assist the people sent by them in the obtaining of vessels, and,
if necessary, give them an advance of 300 or 400 Pagodas, stating
that these had been the only reasons why they had consented to deal
with the said Timmerza.In our letter of May 4 Your Honours have been
informed that His Excellency Laurens Pit, Governor of Coromandel, has
consented at our request to communicate with you whenever necessary, as
the means of the Golconda merchants who desire to obtain advances from
the Company, and how much could be advanced to their attorneys.Such
cases must be carefully dealt with, but up to the present no such
request has been made, which is so much the better.I.--The 20,000 paras or 866 2/3 lasts of nely applied for from
Negapatam will come in useful here, although since the date of this
Memoir or the 6th of June the Council agreed to purchase on behalf
of the Company the 125 1/5 lasts of rice brought here in the Bengal
ship of the Nabob of Kateck Caim Caareham, because even this does
not bring the quantity in store to the 600 lasts which are considered
necessary for Jaffnapatam, as is shown under the heading of provisions
and ammunition.It will be necessary to encourage the people from
Bengal in this trade, as has been repeatedly stated.K.--The petition mentioned here, submitted by the bargemen of the
Company's pontons, stating that they have been made to pay all that
had been lost on various cargoes of rice above one per cent., that they
had not been fairly dealt with in the measuring, &c., deserves serious
investigation.It must be seen to that these people are not made to
refund any loss for which they are not responsible and which they could
not prevent, and the annexed recommendation should be followed as far
as reasonable.The point of the unfair measuring must be especially
attended to, since such conduct would deserve severe correction.L.--The instructions given here with regard to the receipt of Pagodas
must be carried out, but none but Negapatam or Palicatte Pagodas
must be received or circulated.Our instructions under the heading
of Golden Pagodas must be observed.M.--The Dessave de Bitter is to employ the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz
in the Public Works Department on his return from Putulang after the
transport of the elephants, being a capable man for this work.The most
necessary work must be carried out first.van Keulen and Petitfilz, presented the son of the deceased
Don Philip Sangerepulle with a horse and a sombreer [83] by order
of His Excellency the Governor, apparently because he was the chief
of the highest caste, or on account of his father's services.Much
has been said against the father, but nothing has been proved, and
indeed greater scoundrels might be found on investigation.Zwaardecroon, because no act of authority was shown
to him, has rejected this presentation and ordered the Political
Council here from the yacht "Bekenstyn" on March 29 of this year to
demand back from the youth this horse and sombreer.This having been
done without my knowledge and consent, I countermand this order, and
expect Your Honours to carry out the orders of His late Excellency the
Governor.[84] With regard to the administration of this Commandement,
I have stated what was necessary under the heading of the Form of
Government at the conclusion of the Memoir to which I herewith refer.I
will only add here that since then I have had reason to doubt whether
my instructions with regard to the Political Council and the manner
in which the administration is to be carried out has been properly
understood.I reiterate therefore that the Dessave de Bitter will be
looked upon and respected as the Chief in the Commandement during
the absence of the Commandeur, and that to him is entrusted the
duty of convening the meetings both of the Political Council and of
the Court of Justice.Also that he will pass and sign all orders,
such as those for the Warehouses, the Treasury, the Workshop, the
Arsenal, and other of the Company's effects.Further, that when he
stays over night in the Castle, he is to give out the watch-word and
see to the opening and the closing of the gates, which, in the event
of his absence, is deputed to the Captain.The Dessave will see that
order and discipline are maintained, especially among the military,
and also that they are regularly drilled.He is further to receive
the daily reports, not only of the military but also of all master
workmen, &c.; in short, he is to carry out all work just as if the
Commandeur were present.Recommending thus far and thus briefly these
instructions as a guidance to the Administrateur and the Political
Council, and praying God's blessing--


I remain, Sirs, etc.,

person employed in the transaction.[28] The juice of the palmyra fruit dried into cakes.[34] Bananas: the word is in use in Java.[36] This has been translated into English, and forms an Appendix to
the Memoir of Governor Ryckloff van Goens, junior, to be had at the

the course of time its local value appears to have depreciated, and as
a denomination of currency it came to represent only 48 stivers.Yet
to preserve a fictitious identity with the original rix-dollar, the
local mint turned out stivers of lower value, of which 60 were made
to correspond to 48 of the Dutch stivers.[38] In China a picol is equal to 133-1/3 lb.[39] Probably the Malay word bahar.The

Blom dated 1690 will be translated for this series.[66] The figures are as given in the MS.It is difficult to reconcile
these equivalents with the rate of 3 guilders to the rix-dollar.The

1697.It was made
when thousands of English soldiers were upon our soil, and when the
principal cities of America were in the substantial possession of
the enemy.And so, I say, all things considered, it was the bravest
political document ever signed by man.I have a dream that this world is growing better and better every day
and every year; that there is more charity, more justice, more love
every day.I have a dream that prisons will not always curse the earth;
that the shadow of the gallows will not always fall on the land; that
the withered hand of want will not always be stretched out for charity;
that finally wisdom will sit in the legislature, justice in the courts,
charity will occupy all the pulpits, and that finally the world will be
controlled by liberty and love, by justice and charity.That is my
dream, and if it does not come true, it shall not be my fault.The Column of July

I stood, a little while ago, in the city of Paris, where stood the
Bastile, where now stands the column of July, surmounted by the figure
of Liberty.In its right hand is a broken chain, in its left hand a
hammer; upon its shining forehead a glittering star--and as I looked
upon it I said, such is the Republican party of my country.A Nation of Rascals

Samuel J. Tilden says we are a nation of thieves and rascals.If that is
so he ought to be President.But I denounce him as a calumniator of
my country; a maligner of this nation.This country is
covered with asylums for the aged, the helpless, the insane, the orphan,
the wounded soldiers.Thieves and rascals don't build such things.In the cities of the Atlantic coast this summer, they built floating
hospitals, great ships, and took the little children from the
sub-cellars and narrow, dirty streets of New York city, where the
Democratic party is the strongest--took these poor waifs and put them in
these great hospitals out at sea, and let the breezes of ocean kiss the
rose of health back to their pallid cheeks.Rascals and thieves do not
do so.When Chicago burned, railroads were blocked with the charity of
the American people.Thieves and rascals did not do so.We are a Great People

We are a great people.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen
states to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the
conveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes
two hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves
his friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the
obligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest
sympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for
himself, is the best man.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of the
air, and have given one country to mankind.Mule Equality

Suppose there was a great horse-race here to-day, free to every horse
in the world, and to all the mules, and all the scrubs, and all the
donkeys.At the tap of the drum they come to the line, and the judges
say "it is a go."Let me ask you, what does the blooded horse, rushing
ahead, with nostrils distended, drinking in the breath of his own
swiftness, with his mane flying like a banner of victory, with his veins
standing out all over him, as if a net of life had been cast around
him--with his thin neck, his high withers, his tremulous flanks--what
does he care how many mules and donkeys run on the track?But the
Democratic scrub, with his chuckle-head and lop-ears, with his tail full
of cockle-burs, jumping high and short, and digging in the ground when
he feels the breath of the coming mule on his cockle-bur tail, he is
the chap that jumps the track and says, "I am down on mule equality."My
friends, the Republican party is the blooded horse in this race.There is room in the Republican air for every wing; there is room on
the Republican sea for every sail.Republicanism says to every man: "Let
your soul be like an eagle; fly out in the great dome of thought, and
question the stars for yourself."I am a Republican because it is the only free party that ever existed.It is a party that had a platform as broad as humanity, a platform as
broad as the human race, a party that says you shall have all the
fruit of the labor of your hands, a party that says you may think for
yourself; a party that says no chains for the hands, no fetters for the
soul.Our Government the best on Earth

We all want a good government.We
all want to live in a land where the law is supreme.We desire to live
beneath a flag that will protect every citizen beneath its folds.We
desire to be citizens of a government so great and so grand that it will
command the respect of the civilized world.Most of us are convinced
that our government is the best upon this earth.Will the Second Century of America be as good as the First?Standing here amid the sacred memories of the first, on the golden
threshold of the second, I ask, Will the second century be as good
as the first?I believe it will because we are growing more and more
humane; I believe there is more human kind-ness and a greater desire
to help one another in America, than in all the world besides.The steam
engine--the telegraph--these are but the toys with which science has
been amusing herself.A grander standard of character, of literature and
art.We have now half as many millions of people as we have years.We are struggling more and more to get at the philosophy of
life--trying more and more to answer the questions of the eternal
Sphinx.The second century will be grander than the first.Science found agriculture plowing with a stick--reaping with a
sickle--commerce at the mercy of the treacherous waves and the
inconstant winds--a world without books--without schools--man denying
the authority of reason, employing his ingenuity in the manufacture
of instruments of torture, in building inquisitions and cathedrals.It found the land filled with malicious monks--with persecuting
Protestants, and the burners of men.The glory of science is, that it is
freeing the soul--breaking the mental manacles--getting the brain out
of bondage--giving courage to thought--filling the world with mercy,
justice, and joy.The Tables Turned

For the establishment of facts, the word of man is now considered
far better than the word of God.In the world of science, Jehovah was
superseded by Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler.All that God told
Moses, admitting the entire account to be true, is dust and ashes
compared to the discoveries of Des Cartes, La Place, and Humboldt.In
matters of fact, the Bible has ceased to be regarded as a standard.Science has succeeded in breaking the chains of theology.A few years
ago, science endeavored to show that it was not inconsistent with the
Bible.The tables have been turned, and now, religion is endeavoring to
prove that the Bible is not inconsistent with science.Science Better than a Creed

It seems to me that a belief in the great truths of science are fully as
essential to salvation, as the creed of any church.We are taught that
a man may be perfectly acceptable to God even if he denies the rotundity
of the earth, the Copernican system, the three laws of Kepler, the
indestructibility of matter and the attraction of gravitation.And we
are also taught that a man may be right upon all these questions, and
yet, for failing to believe in the "scheme of salvation," be eternally
lost.The Religion of Science

Every assertion of individual independence has been a step toward
infidelity.Luther started toward Humboldt,--Wesley, toward John Stuart
Mill.To really reform the church is to destroy it.Every new religion
has a little less superstition than the old, so that the religion of
science is but a question of time.Science not Sectarian

The sciences are not sectarian.People do not persecute each other on
account of disagreements in mathematics.Families are not divided about
botany, and astronomy does not even tend to make a man hate his father
and mother.It is what people do not know, that they persecute each
other about.Science will bring, not a sword, but peace.The Epitaph of all Religions

Science has written over the high altar its mene, mene, tekel,
UPHARSIN--the old words, destined to be the epitaph of all religions?The Real Priest

When we abandon the doctrine that some infinite being created matter
and force, and enacted a code of laws for their government, the idea
of interference will be lost.The real priest will then be, not the
mouth-piece of some pretended deity, but the interpreter of nature.From
that moment the church ceases to exist.The tapers will die out upon the
dusty altar; the moths will eat the fading velvet of pulpit and pew;
the Bible will take its place with the Shastras, Puranas, Vedas, Eddas,
Sagas and Korans, and the fetters of a degrading faith will fall from
the minds of men.Science is Power

From a philosophical point of view, science is knowledge of the laws
of life; of the conditions of happiness; of the facts by which we are
surrounded, and the relations we sustain to men and things--by means
of which, man, so to speak, subjugates nature and bends the elemental
powers to his will, making blind force the servant of his brain.Science Supreme

The element of uncertainty will, in a great measure, be removed from the
domain of the future, and man, gathering courage from a succession of
victories over the obstructions of nature, will attain a serene grandeur
unknown to the disciples of any superstition.The plans of mankind will
no longer be interfered with by the finger of a supposed omnipotence,
and no one will believe that nations or individuals are protected or
destroyed by any deity whatever.Science, freed from the chains of pious
custom and evangelical prejudice, will, within her sphere, be supreme.The mind will investigate without reverence, and publish its conclusions
without fear.Agassiz will no longer hesitate to declare the Mosaic
cosmogony utterly inconsistent with the demonstrated truths of geology,
and will cease pretending any reverence for the Jewish scriptures.The
moment science succeeds in rendering the church powerless for evil, the
real thinkers will be outspoken.The little flags of truce carried by
timid philosophers will disappear, and the cowardly parley will give
place to victory--lasting and universal.Science Opening the Gates of Thought

We are not endeavoring to chain the future, but to free the present.We
are not forging fetters for our children, but we are breaking those our
fathers made for us.We are the advocates of inquiry, of investigation
and thought.This of itself, is an admission that we are not perfectly
satisfied with all our conclusions.Philosophy has not the egotism of
faith.While superstition builds walls and creates obstructions, science
opens all the highways of thought.Stars and Grains of Sand

We do not say that we have discovered all; that our doctrines are the
all in all of truth.We know of no end to the development of man.We
cannot unravel the infinite complications of matter and force.The
history of one monad is as unknown as that of the universe; one drop of
water is as wonderful as all the seas; one leaf, as all the forests; and
one grain of sand, as all the stars.The Trinity of Science

Reason, Observation and Experience--the Holy Trinity of Science--have
taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is
now, and the way to be happy is to make others so.In this belief we are content to live and die.If by any possibility
the existence of a power superior to, and independent of, nature shall
be demonstrated, there will then be time enough to kneel.Until then,
let us all stand nobly erect.The Old and the New Old ideas perished in the retort of the
chemist, and useful truths took their places.One by one religious
conceptions have been placed in the crucible of science, and thus far,
nothing but dross has been found.A new world has been discovered by the
microscope; everywhere has been found the infinite; in every direction
man has investigated and explored, and nowhere, in earth or stars,
has been found the footstep of any being superior to or independent
of nature.Nowhere has been discovered the slightest evidence of any
interference from without.The Triumphs of Science

I do not know what inventions are in the brain of the future; I do not
know what garments of glory may be woven for the world in the loom of
years to be; we are just on the edge of the great ocean of discovery.I
do not know what is to be discovered; I do not know what science will do
for us.I do know that science did just take a handful of sand and make
the telescope, and with it read all the starry leaves of heaven; I know
that science took the thunderbolts from the hands of Jupiter, and now
the electric spark, freighted with thought and love, flashes under the
waves of the sea; I know that science stole a tear from the cheek of
unpaid labor, converted it into steam, and created a giant that turns
with tireless arms the countless wheels of toil; I know that science
broke the chains from human limbs and gave us instead the forces of
nature for our slaves; I know that we have made the attraction of
gravitation work for us; we have made the lightnings our messengers; we
have taken advantage of fire and flames and wind and sea; these slaves
have no backs to be whipped; they have no hearts to be lacerated; they
have no children to be stolen, no cradles to be violated.I know that
science has given us better houses; I know it has given us better
pictures and better books; I know it has given us better wives and
better husbands, and more beautiful children.I know it has enriched
a thousand-fold our life; and therefore I am in favor of perfect
intellectual liberty.It found the world at the mercy of disease and famine; men trying to
read their fates in the stars, and to tell their fortunes by signs and
wonders; generals thinking to conquer their enemies by making the sign
of the cross, or by telling a rosary.It found all history full of petty
and ridiculous falsehood, and the Almighty was supposed to spend most
of his time turning sticks into snakes, drowning boys for swimming on
Sunday, and killing little children for the purpose of converting their
parents.It found the earth filled with slaves and tyrants, the people
in all countries downtrodden, half naked, half starved, without hope,
and without reason in the world.Science the only Lever

Such was the condition of man when the morning of science dawned upon
his brain, and before he had heard the sublime declaration that the
universe is governed by law.For the change that has taken place we are
indebted solely to science--the only lever capable of raising mankind.Abject faith is barbarism; reason is civilization.To obey is slavish;
to act from a sense of obligation perceived by the reason, is noble.Ignorance worships mystery; Reason explains it: the one grovels, the
other soars.I have sometimes wished that there were words of pure hatred out of
which I might construct sentences like snakes, out of which I might
construct sentences with mouths fanged, that had forked tongues, out of
which I might construct sentences that writhed and and hissed; then I
could give my opinion of the rebels during the great struggle for the
preservation of this nation.Slavery in the Name of Religion

Just think of it!Our churches and best people, as they call themselves,
defending the institution of slavery.When I was a little boy I used
to see steamers go down the Mississippi river with hundreds of men and
women chained hand to hand, and even children, and men standing about
them with whips in their hands and pistols in their pockets in the name
of liberty, in the name of civilization and in the name of religion!I
used to hear them preach to these slaves in the South and the only text
they ever took was "Servants be obedient unto your masters."That was
the salutation of the most merciful God to a man whose back was bleeding
that was the salutation of the most merciful God to the slave-mother
bending over an empty cradle, to the woman from whose breast a child
had been stolen--"Servants be obedient unto your masters."That was
what they said to a man running for his life and for his liberty through
tangled swamps and listening to the baying of blood-hounds, and when
he listened for them the voice came from heaven:--"Servants be obedient
unto your masters."Think how we have crouched and cringed before wealth even!How
they used to cringe in old times before a man who was rich--there are so
many of them gone into bankruptcy lately that we are losing a little of
our fear.The Patrons of Slavery

It is not possible for the human imagination to conceive of the horrors
of slavery.It has left no possible wrong uncommitted, no possible crime
un-perpetrated.It has been practiced and defended by all nations in
some form.It has been defended
by nearly every pulpit.From the profits derived from the slave trade,
churches have been built, cathedrals reared and priests paid.Slavery
has been blessed by bishop, by cardinal and by pope.It has received the
sanction of statesmen, of kings, of queens.Clergymen have taken their part of the spoil, reciting passages
of scripture in its defense, and judges have taken their portion in the
name of equity and law.A <DW52> Man in Congress

The world has changed!I have had the supreme pleasure of seeing a
man--once a slave--sitting in the seat of his former master in the
Congress of the United States.When I saw that sight, my eyes were
filled with tears.I felt that we had carried out the Declaration of
Independence, that we had given reality to it, and breathed the breath
of life into every word.I felt that our flag would float over and
protect the <DW52> man and his little children--standing straight in
the sun--just the same as though he were white and worth a million!The Zig-zag Strip

I have some excuses to offer for the race to which I belong.My first
excuse is that this is not a very good world to raise folks in anyway.It is not very well adapted to raising magnificent people.There's only
a quarter of it land to start with.It is three times better for raising
fish than folks; and in that one-quarter of land there is not a tenth
part fit to raise people on.You can't raise people without a good
climate.You have got to have the right kind of climate, and you have
got to have certain elements in the soil or you can't raise good people.Do you know that there is only a little zig-zag strip around the world
within which have been produced all men of genius?Black People have Suffered Enough

In my judgment the black people have suffered enough.They have been
slaves for two hundred years.They have been owned two hundred years,
and, more than all, they have been compelled to keep the company of
those who owned them.Think of being compelled to keep the society of
the man who is stealing from you.Think of being compelled to live with
a man that stole your child from the cradle before your very eyes.Think
of being compelled to live with a thief all your life, to spend your
days with a white loafer, and to be under his control.The History of Civilization

The history of civilization is the history of the slow and painful
enfranchisement of the human race.In the olden times the family was a
monarchy, the father being the monarch.The mother and children were the
veriest slaves.The will of the father was the supreme law.He had the
power of life and death.It took thousands of years to civilize this
father, thousands of years to make the condition of the wife and mother
and children even tolerable.A few families constituted a tribe; the
tribe had a chief; the chief was a tyrant; a few tribes formed a nation;
the nation was governed by a king, who was also a tyrant.A strong
nation robbed, plundered and took captive the weaker ones.Is there, in the civilized world, to-day, a clergyman who believes
in the divinity of slavery?Does the Bible teach man to enslave his
brother?If it does, is it not blasphemous to say that it is inspired
of God?If you find the institution of slavery upheld in a book said
to have been written by God, what would you expect to find in a book
inspired by the devil?Would you expect to find that book in favor of
liberty?Modern Christians, ashamed of the God of the Old Testament,
endeavor now to show that slavery was neither commanded nor opposed by
Jehovah.Solemn Defiance

For my part, I never will, I never can, worship a God who upholds the
institution of slavery.I neither want his
heaven, nor fear his hell.The Soldiers of the Republic

The soldiers of the Republic were not seekers after vulgar glory.They
were not animated by the hope of plunder or the love of conquest.They
fought to preserve the blessings of liberty and that their children
might have peace.They were the defenders of humanity, the destroyers
of prejudice, the breakers of chains, and in the name of the future they
slew the monster of their time.They blotted from the statute books laws that
had been passed by hypocrites at the instigation of robbers, and tore
with indignant hands from the Constitution that infamous clause that
made men the catchers of their fellow men.They made it possible for
judges to be just, for statesmen to be human, and for politicians to be
honest.They broke the shackles from the limbs of slaves, from the souls
of martyrs, and from the Northern brain.They kept our country on the
map of the world and our flag in heaven.Seven long years of war--fighting for what?For the principle that
all men were created equal--a truth that nobody ever disputed except
a scoundrel; nobody in the entire history of this world.No man ever
denied that truth who was not a rascal, and at heart a thief; never,
never, and never will.Simply that in
America every man should have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.Nobody ever denied that except a villain; never, never.It has been denied by kings--they were thieves.It has been denied by
statesmen--they were liars.It has been denied by priests, by clergymen,
by cardinals, by bishops and by popes--they were hypocrites.For the idea that all political power is vested
in the great body of the people.They make all the money; do all the
work.They plow the land; cut down the forests; they produce everything
that is produced.Then who shall say what shall be done with what is
produced except the producer?The Revolution Consummated

The soldiers of the Republic finished what the soldiers of the
Revolution commenced.They relighted the torch that fell from their
august hands and filled the world again with light.The soldiers went home to their waiting wives, to their glad children,
and to the girls they loved--they went back to the fields, the shops and
mines.They were
as honest in peace as they had been brave in war.Mocking at poverty,
laughing at reverses, they made a friend of toil.They said: "We saved
the nation's life, and what is life without honor?"They worked and
wrought with all of labor's sons, that every pledge the nation gave
should be redeemed.And their great leader, having put a shining hand of
friendship--a girdle of clasped and happy hands--around the globe, comes
home and finds that every promise made in war has now the ring and gleam
of gold.Manhood worth more than Gold

We say in this country manhood is worth more than gold.We say in this
country that without liberty the Nation is not worth preserving.I
appeal to every laboring man, and I ask him, "Is there another country
on this globe where you can have your equal rights with others?"Now,
then, in every country, no matter how good it is, and no matter how bad
it is--in every country there is something worth preserving, and there
is something that ought to be destroyed.Now recollect that every voter
is in his own right a king; every voter in this country wears a crown;
every voter in this country has in his hands the scepter of authority;
and every voter, poor and rich, wears the purple of authority alike.Recollect it; and the man that will sell his vote is the man that
abdicates the American throne.Grander than the Greek, nobler than the Roman, the soldiers of the
republic, with patriotism as taintless as the air, battled for the
rights of others; for the nobility of labor; fought that mothers might
own their babes; that arrogant idleness should not scar the back of
patient toil, and that our country should not be a many-headed monster
made of warring States, but a Nation, sovereign, great and free.Blood
was water; money, leaves, and life was common air until one flag floated
over a republic without a master and without a slave.Let us Drink to the Living and the Dead

The soldiers of the Union saved the South as well as the North.Their victory made us free and rendered tyranny in
every other land as insecure as snow upon volcano lips.And now let us
drink to the volunteers, to those who sleep in unknown, sunken graves,
whose names are only in the hearts of those they loved and left--of
those who only hear in happy dreams the footsteps of return.Let us
drink to those who died where lipless famine mocked at want--to all the
maimed whose scars give modesty a tongue, to all who dared and gave to
chance the care and keeping of their lives--to all the living and all
the dead--to Sherman, to Sheridan and to Grant, the foremost soldiers of
the world; and last, to Lincoln, whose loving life, like a bow of peace,
spans and arches all the clouds of war.Will the Wounds of the War be Healed?There is still another question: "Will all the wounds of the war be
healed?"The Southern people must submit, not to the
dictation of the North, but to the nation's will and to the verdict of
mankind.They were wrong, and the time will come when they will say
that they have been vanquished by the right.Freedom conquered them, and
freedom will cultivate their fields, educate their children, weave for
them the robes of wealth, execute their laws, and fill their land with
happy homes.Saviours of the Nation

They rolled the stone from the sepulchre of progress, and found therein
two angels clad in shining garments--nationality and liberty.The
soldiers were the Saviours of the Nation.In writing the proclamation of emancipation, Lincoln, greatest
of our mighty dead, whose memory is as gentle as the summer air,--when
reapers sing'mid gathered sheaves,--copied with the pen what Grant and
his brave comrades wrote with swords.General Grant

When the savagery of the lash, the barbarism of the chain, and the
insanity of secession confronted the civilization of our century, the
question, "Will the great republic defend itself?"trembled on the
lips of every lover of mankind.The North, filled with intelligence and
wealth, products of liberty, marshalled her hosts and asked only for
a leader.From civil life a man, silent, thoughtful, poised, and calm;
stepped forth, and with the lips of victory voiced the nation's first
and last demand: "Unconditional and immediate surrender."From that
moment the end was known.That utterance was the real declaration of
real war and in accordance with the dramatic unities of mighty
events, the great soldier who made it, received the final sword of the
rebellion.The soldiers of the republic were not seekers after vulgar
glory; they were not animated by the hope of plunder or the love of
conquest.They fought to preserve the homestead of liberty.MONEY THAT IS MONEY




142.Paper is not Money

Some people tell me that the government can impress its sovereignty on
a piece of paper, and that is money.Well, if it is, what's the use of
wasting it making one dollar bills?It takes no more ink and no more
paper--why not make $1000 bills?Why not make $100,000,000 and all be
billionaires?If the government can make money, what on earth does it
collect taxes for you and me for?Why don't it make what money it wants,
take the taxes out, and give the balance to us?Greenbacker, suppose
the government issued $1,000,000,000 to-morrow, how would you get any of
it?The Debt will be paid

It will be paid.The holders of the debt have got a mortgage on a
continent.They have a mortgage on the honor of the Republican party,
and it is on record.Every blade of grass that grows upon this continent
is a guarantee that the debt will be paid; every field of bannered corn
in the great, glorious West is a guarantee that the debt will be paid;
all the coal put away in the ground, millions of years ago by the old
miser, the sun; is a guarantee that every dollar of that debt will be
paid; all the cattle on the prairies, pastures and plains, every one of
them is a guarantee that this debt will be paid; every pine standing
in the sombre forests of the North, waiting for the woodman's axe, is
a guarantee that this debt will be paid; all the gold and silver hid in
the Sierra Nevadas, waiting for the miner's pick, is a guarantee that
the debt will be paid; every locomotive, with its muscles of iron and
breath of flame, and all the boys and girls bending over their books at
school, every dimpled child in the cradle, every good man and every good
woman, and every man that votes the Republican ticket, is a guarantee
that the debt will be paid.No man can imagine, all the languages of the world cannot express, what
the people of the United States suffered from 1873 to 1879.Men who
considered themselves millionaires found that they were beggars; men
living in palaces, supposing they had enough to give sunshine to the
winter of their age, supposing they had enough to have all they loved
in affluence and comfort, suddenly found that they were mendicants with
bonds, stocks, mortgages, all turned to ashes in their aged, trembling
hands.The chimneys grew cold, the fires in furnaces went out, the poor
families were turned adrift, and the highways of the United States were
crowded with tramps.Into the home of the poor crept the serpent of
temptation, and whispered in the ear of poverty the terrible word
"repudiation."A Voter because a Man

A man does not vote in this country simply because he is rich; he does
not vote in this country simply because he has an education; he does
not vote simply because he has talent or genius; we say that he votes
because he is a man, and that he has his manhood to support; and we
admit in this country that nothing can be more valuable to any human
being than his manhood, and for that reason we put poverty on an
equality with wealth.If you are a German, recollect that this country is kinder to you than
your own fatherland,--no matter what country you came from, remember
that this country is an asylum, and vote as in your conscience you
believe you ought to vote to keep this flag in heaven.I beg every
American to stand with that part of the country that believes in law, in
freedom of speech, in an honest vote, in civilization, in progress, in
human liberty, and in universal justice.Prosperity and Resumption hand in hand

The Republicans of the United States demand a man who knows that
prosperity and resumption, when they come, must come together; that when
they come they will come hand in hand through the golden harvest fields;
hand in hand by the whirling spindles and the turning wheels; hand in
hand past the open furnace doors; hand in hand by the chimneys filled
with eager fire, greeted and grasped by the countless sons of toil.This money has to be dug out of the earth.You cannot make it by passing
resolutions in a political convention.Every Poor Man should Stand by the Government

It is the only Nation where the man clothed in a rag stands upon an
equality with the one wearing purple.It is the only country in the
world where, politically, the hut is upon an equality with the palace.For that reason, every poor man should stand by the government, and
every poor man who does not is a traitor to the best interests of his
children; every poor man who does not is willing his children should
bear the badge of political inferiority; and the only way to make this
government a complete and perfect success is for the poorest man to
think as much of his manhood as the millionaire does of his wealth.I want to tell you that you cannot conceive of what the American people
suffered as they staggered over the desert of bankruptcy from 1873 to
1879.We are too near now to know how grand we were.The poor mechanic said
"No;" the ruined manufacturer said "No;" the once millionaire said "No,
we will settle fair; we will agree to pay whether we ever pay or
not, and we will never soil the American name with the infamous word,
'repudiation.'"Are you not glad
that our flag is covered all over with financial honors?The stars shine
and gleam now because they represent an honest nation.A Government with a Long Arm

I believe in a Government with an arm long enough to reach the collar
of any rascal beneath its flag.I want it with an arm long enough and
a sword sharp enough to strike down tyranny wherever it may raise its
snaky head.I want a nation that can hear the faintest cries of its
humblest citizen.I want a nation that will protect a freedman standing
in the sun by his little cabin, just as quick as it would protect
Vanderbilt in a palace of marble and gold.No Repudiation

Then it was, that the serpent of temptation whispered in the ear of want
that dreadful word "Repudiation."They
appealed to want, to misery, to threatened financial ruin, to the bare
hearthstones, to the army of beggars, We had grandeur enough to say:
"No; we'll settle fair if we don't pay a cent!"Is there a Democrat now who wishes we had taken the advice of
Bayard to scale the bonds?Is there an American, a Democrat here, who
is not glad we escaped the stench and shame of repudiation, and did not
take Democratic advice?Is there a Greenbacker here who is not glad we
didn't do it?He may say he is, but he isn't.I think there is the greatest heroism in living for a thing!There's no
glory in digging potatoes.You don't wear a uniform when you're picking
up stones.You can't have a band of music when you dig potatoes!In,
1873 came the great crash.No one can estimate the anguish of that time!Millionaires found
themselves paupers.The aged man,
who had spent his life in hard labor, and who thought he had accumulated
enough to support himself in his old age, and leave a little something
to his children and grandchildren, found they were all beggars.The
highways were filled with tramps.Promises Don't Pay

If I am fortunate enough to leave a dollar when I die, I want it to be
a good one; I don't wish to have it turn to ashes in the hands of
widowhood, or become a Democratic broken promise in the pocket of the
orphan; I want it money.I saw not long ago a piece of gold bearing the
stamp of the Roman Empire.That Empire is dust, and over it has been
thrown the mantle of oblivion, but that piece of gold is as good as
though Julius Caesar were still riding at the head of the Roman Legion.I want money to that will outlive the Democratic party.They told
us--and they were honest about it--they said, "when we have plenty of
money we are prosperous."And I said: "When we are prosperous, then we
have credit, and, credit inflates the currency.Whenever a man buys a
pound of sugar and says, 'Charge it,' he inflates the currency; whenever
he gives his note, he inflates the currency; whenever his word takes the
place of money, he inflates the currency."The consequence is that when
we are prosperous, credit takes the place of money, and we have what
we call "plenty."But you can't increase prosperity simply by using
promises to pay.I do not wish to trust the wealth of this nation with the demagogues of
the nation.I do not wish to trust the wealth of the country to every
blast of public opinion.I want money as solid as the earth on which we
tread, as bright as the stars that shine above us.The South and the Tariff

Where did this doctrine of a tariff for revenue only come from?The South would like to stab the prosperity of the North.They
had rather trade with Old England than with New England.They had rather
trade with the people who were willing to help them in war than those
who conquered the rebellion.They knew what gave us our strength in
war.They knew all the brooks and creeks and rivers in New England were
putting down the rebellion.They knew that every wheel that turned,
every spindle that revolved, was a soldier in the army of human
progress.They were so lured by the greed of office that
they were willing to trade upon the misfortune of a nation.I don't wish to belong to a party that succeeds only when my country
falls.I don't wish to belong to a party whose banner went up with
the banner of rebellion.I don't wish to belong to a party that was in
partnership with defeat and disaster.I am for Protection

And I will tell you why I am for protection, too.If we were all farmers
we would be stupid.If we were all shoemakers we would be stupid.If
we all followed one business, no matter what it was, we would become
stupid.Protection to American labor diversifies American industry, and
to have it diversified touches and developes every part of the human
brain.Protection protects integrity; it protects intelligence; and
protection raises sense; and by protection we have greater men and
better-looking women and healthier children.Free trade means that our
laborer is upon an equality with the poorest paid labor of this world.The Old Woman of Tewksbury

You Greenbackers are like the old woman in the Tewksbury, Mass.,
Poor-House.She used to be well off, and didn't like her quarters.You
Greenbackers have left your father's house of many mansions and have fed
on shucks about long enough.The Supervisor came into the Poor-House one
day and asked the old lady how she liked it.She said she didn't like
the company, and asked him what he would advise her to do under similar
circumstances."Do you think anybody is ever prejudiced in their sleep?"I dreamed I died and went to
Heaven.A nice man came to me and asked
me where I was from.Says I, 'From Tewksbury, Mass.'He looked in his
book and said, 'You can't stay here.'"I asked what he would advise me
to do under similar circumstances."'Well,' he said, 'there's hell down
there, you might try that.'"Well, I went down there, and the men told
me my name wasn't on the book and I couldn't stay there.'Well,' said I,
'What would you advise me to do under similar circumstances?''Said he,
'You'll have to go back to Tewksbury.'And when Green-backers remember
what they once were, you must feel now, when you were forced to join
the Democratic party, as bad as the old lady who had to go back to
Tewksbury.American Muscle, Coined into Gold

I believe in American labor, and I tell you why.The other day a man
told me that we had produced in the United States of America one million
tons of rails.In other
words, the million tons are worth $60,000,000.How much is a ton of iron
worth in the ground?American labor takes 25 cents of
iron in the ground and adds to it $59.75.One million tons of rails, and
the raw material not worth $24,000.We build a ship in the United States
worth $500,000, and the value of the ore in the earth, of the trees in
the great forest, of all that enters into the composition of that ship
bringing $500,000 in gold is only $20,000; $480,000 by American labor,
American muscle, coined into gold; American brains made a legal-tender
the world around.Inflation

I don't blame the man who wanted inflation.I don't blame him for
praying for another period of inflation."When it comes," said the man
who had a lot of shrunken property on his hands, "blame me, if I don't
unload, you may shoot me."It's a good deal like the game of poker!I
don't suppose any of you know anything about that game!Along towards
morning the fellow who is ahead always wants another deal.The fellow
that is behind says his wife's sick, and he must go home.You ought
to hear that fellow descant on domestic virtue!And the other fellow
accuses him of being a coward and wanting to jump the game.A man whose
dead wood is hung up on the shore in a dry time, wants the water to rise
once more and float it out into the middle of the stream.We have fifty-six thousand
square miles of land--nearly thirty-six million acres.Upon these plains
we can raise enough to feed and clothe twenty million people.Beneath
these prairies were hidden, millions of ages ago, by that old miser, the
sun, thirty-six thousand square miles of coal.The aggregate thickness
of these veins is at least fifteen feet.Think of a column of coal one
mile square and one hundred miles high!What
a sunbeam such a column would be!Think of all this force, willed and
left to us by the dead morning of the world!Think of the fireside of
the future around which will sit the fathers, mothers and children of
the years to be!Think of the sweet and happy faces, the loving and
tender eyes that will glow and gleam in the sacred light of all these
flames!They say that money is a measure of value.A bushel doesn't
measure values.If it measured
values, a bushel of potatoes would be worth as much as a bushel of
diamonds.They used to say,
"there's no use in having a gold yard-stick."You
don't buy the yard-stick.If money bore the same relation to trade as
a yard-stick or half-bushel, you would have the same money when you
got through trading as you had when you begun.A man don't sell
half-bushels.All we want is a little sense about these
things.Some said there
wasn't enough money.That's so; I know what that means myself.They said
if we had more money we'd be more prosperous.The truth is, if we
were more prosperous we'd have more money.They said more money would
facilitate business.Money by Work

How do you get your money?You have got to dig it
out of the ground.In old times there were
some men who thought they could get some way to turn the baser metals
into gold, and old gray-haired men, trembling, tottering on the verge of
the grave, were hunting for something to turn ordinary metals into gold;
they were searching for the fountain of eternal youth, but they did not
find it.No human ear has ever heard the silver gurgle of the spring of
immortal youth.Meat Twice a Year

I have been in countries where the laboring man had meat once a year;
sometimes twice--Christmas and Easter.And I have seen women carrying
upon their heads a burden that no man would like to carry, and at the
same time knitting busily with both hands.And those women lived without
meat; and when I thought of the American laborer I said to myself,
"After all, my country is the best in the world."And when I came back
to the sea and saw the old flag flying in the air, it seemed to me as
though the air from pure joy had burst into blossom.America a Glorious Land

Labor has more to eat and more to wear in the United States than in
any other land of this earth.I want America to produce everything
that Americans need.I want it so if the whole world should declare war
against us, so if we were surrounded by walls of cannon and bayonets and
swords, we could supply all human wants in and of ourselves.I want to
live to see the American woman dressed in American silk; the American
man in everything from hat to boots produced in America by the cunning
hand of the American toiler.How to Spend a Dollar

If you have only a dollar in the world and have got to spend it, spend
it like a man; spend it like a prince, like a king!If you have to spend
it, spend it as though it were a dried leaf, and you were the owner of
unbounded forests.Honesty is Best always and Everywhere

I am next in favor of honest money.I am in favor of gold and silver,
and paper with gold and silver behind it.I believe in silver, because
it is one of the greatest of American products, and I am in favor of
anything that will add to the value of American products.But I want a
silver dollar worth a gold dollar, even if you make it or have to make
it four feet in diameter.No government can afford to be a clipper of
coin.A great Republic cannot afford to stamp a lie upon silver or gold.Honest money, an honest people, an honest Nation.When our money is only
worth 80 cents on the dollar, we feel 20 per cent, below par.When our
money is good we feel good.When our money is at par, that is where we
are.I am a profound believer in the doctrine that for nations as well
as men, honesty is the best, always, everywhere and forever.A Fountain of Greenbacks

There used to be mechanics that tried to make perpetual motion by
combinations of wheels, shifting weights, and rolling balls; but somehow
the machine would never quite run.A perpetual fountain of greenbacks,
of wealth without labor, is just as foolish as a fountain of eternal
youth.The idea that you can produce money without labor is just as
foolish as the idea of perpetual motion.They are old follies under new
names.We had to borrow some money to pay for shot and
shell to shoot Democrats with.We found that we could get along with a
few less Democrats, but not with any less country, and so we borrowed
the money, and the question now is, will we pay it?And which party is
the most apt to pay it, the Republican party, that made the debt--the
party that swore it was constitutional, or the party that said it was
unconstitutional?Whenever a Democrat sees a greenback, the greenback
says to the Democrat, "I am one of the fellows that whipped you."Whenever a Republican sees a greenback, the greenback says to him, "You
and I put down the rebellion and saved the country."Honest Methods

So many presidents of savings banks, even those belonging to the Young
Men's Christian Association, run off with the funds; so many railroad
and insurance companies are in the hands of receivers; there is so much
bankruptcy on every hand, that all capital is held in the nervous clutch
of fear.Slowly, but surely, we are coming back to honest methods in
business.Confidence will return, and then enterprise will unlock the
safe and money will again circulate as of yore; the dollars will leave
their hitting places, and every one will be seeking investment.For my part I do not ask any interference on the part of the government
except to undo the wrong it has done.I do not ask that money be made
out of nothing.I do not ask for the prosperity born of paper.But I do
ask for the remonetization of silver.It was an imposition upon every solvent man; a fraud upon every honest
debtor in the United States.It was done in the
interest of avarice and greed, and should be undone by honest men.RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS




171.Redden your hands with human blood; blast by slander the fair fame
of the innocent; strangle the smiling child upon its mother's knees;
deceive, ruin and desert the beautiful girl who loves and trusts you,
and your case is not hopeless.For all this, and for all these you
may be forgiven.For all this, and for all these, that bankrupt court
established by the gospel, will give you a discharge; but deny the
existence of these divine ghosts, of these gods, and the sweet and
tearful face of Mercy becomes livid with eternal hate.Heaven's golden
gates are shut, and you, with an infinite curse ringing in your
ears, with the brand of infamy upon your brow, commence your endless
wanderings in the lurid gloom of hell--an immortal vagrant--an eternal
outcast--a deathless convict.Faith--A Mixture of Insanity and Ignorance

The doctrine that future happiness depends upon belief is monstrous.It is the infamy of infamies.The notion that faith in Christ is to
be rewarded by an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon reason,
observation, and experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for
refutation, and can be relieved only by that unhappy mixture of insanity
and ignorance; called "faith."The church in the days of Voltaire contended that its servants were the
only legitimate physicians.The priests cured in the name of the church,
and in the name of God--by exorcism, relics, water, salt and oil.Gervasius was good for rheumatism, St.Ovidius
for deafness, St.Apollonia for
toothache, St.Clara for rheum in the eye, St.Devils were driven out with wax tapers, with incence (sp.), with holy
water, by pronouncing prayers.The church, as late as the middle of the
twelfth century, prohibited good Catholics from having anything to do
with physicians.The Sleep of Persecutors

All the persecutors sleep in peace, and the ashes of those who burned
their brothers in the name of Christ rest in consecrated ground.Whole
libraries could not contain even the names of the wretches who have
filled the world with violence and death in defense of book and creed,
and yet they all died the death of the righteous, and no priest or|
minister describes the agony and fear, the remorse and horror with which
their guilty souls were filled in the last moments of their lives.These
men had never doubted; they accepted the creed; they were not infidels;
they had not denied the divinity of Christ; they had been baptized;
they had partaken of the last supper; they had respected priests; they
admitted that the Holy Ghost had "proceeded;" and these things put
pillows beneath their dying heads and covered them with the drapery of
peace.There is no recorded instance where the uplifted hand of murder has been
paralyzed--no truthful account in all the literature of the world of the
innocent shielded by God.Thousands of crimes are being committed every
day--men are this moment lying in wait for their human prey; wives
are whipped and crushed, driven to insanity and death; little children
begging for mercy, lifting imploringly tear-filled eyes to the brutal
faces of fathers and mothers; sweet girls are deceived, lured, and
outraged; but God has no time to prevent these things--no time to defend
the good and to protect the pure.He is too busy numbering hairs and
watching sparrows.All kinds of criminals, except infidels, meet death with reasonable
serenity.As a rule, there is nothing in the death of a pirate to cast
any discredit on his profession.The murderer upon the scaffold, with
a priest on either side, smilingly exhorts the multitude to meet him in
heaven.The man who has succeeded in making his home a hell meets death
without a quiver, provided he has never expressed any doubt as to the
divinity of Christ or the eternal "procession" of the holy ghost.The
king who has waged cruel and useless war, who has filled countries with
widows and fatherless children, with the maimed and diseased, and who
has succeeded in offering to the Moloch of ambition the best and bravest
of his subjects, dies like a saint.The first Corpse and the first Cathedral

Now and then, in the history of this world, a man of genius, of sense,
of intellectual honesty has appeared.These men have denounced the
superstitions of their day.To see priests
devour the substance of the people filled them with indignation.These
men were honest enough to tell their thoughts.Then they were denounced,
condemned, executed.Some of them escaped the fury of the people who
loved their enemies, and died naturally in their beds.It would not be
for the church to admit that they died peacefully.That would show that
religion was not actually necessary in the last moment.Religion got
much of its power from the terror of death.Superstition is the child of
ignorance and fear.The first
corpse was the first priest.It would not do to have the common people
understand that a man could deny the Bible, refuse to look at the cross,
contend that Christ was only a man, and yet die as calmly as Calvin did
after he had murdered Servetus, or as King David, after advising one son
to kill another.The Sixteenth Century

In the sixteenth century every science was regarded as an outcast and an
enemy, and the church influenced the world, which was under its
power, to believe anything, and the ignorant mob was always too ready,
brutalized by the church, to hang, kill or crucify at their bidding.Such was the result of a few centuries of Christianity.An Orthodox Gentleman

By Orthodox I mean a gentleman who is petrified in his mind, whooping
around intellectually, simply to save the funeral expenses of his soul.A Bold Assertion

The churches point to their decayed saints, and their crumbled Popes
and say, "Do you know more than all the ministers that ever lived?"And without the slightest egotism or blush I say, yes, and the name of
Humboldt outweighs them all.The men who stand in the front rank, the
men who know most of the secrets of nature, the men who know most are
to-day the advanced infidels of this world.I have lived long enough to
see the brand of intellectual inferiority on every orthodox brain.If we admit that some infinite being has controlled the destinies of
persons and peoples, history becomes a most cruel and bloody farce.Age after age, the strong have trampled upon the weak; the crafty
and heartless have ensnared and enslaved the simple and innocent,
and nowhere, in all the annals of mankind, has any god succored the
oppressed.Weak ones Suffering--Heaven deaf

Most of the misery has been endured by the weak, the loving and the
innocent.Women have been treated like poisonous beasts, and little
children trampled upon as though they had been vermin.Numberless altars
have been reddened, even with the blood of babes; beautiful girls have
been given to slimy serpents; whole races of men doomed to centuries
of slavery, and everywhere there has been outrage beyond the power
of genius to express.During all these years the suffering have
supplicated; the withered lips of famine have prayed; the pale victims
have implored, and Heaven has been deaf and blind.Heaven has no Ear, no Hand

Man should cease to expect aid from on high.By this time he should know
that heaven has no ear to hear, and no hand to help.The present is the
necessary child of all the past.There has been no chance, and there can
be no interference.Religion is Tyrannical

Religion does not, and cannot, contemplate man as free.She accepts only
the homage of the prostrate, and scorns the offerings of those who stand
erect.The wide and sunny
fields belong not to her domain.The star-lit heights of genius and
individuality are above and beyond her appreciation and power.Her
subjects cringe at her feet, covered with the dust of obedience.Religion and Facts

What has religion to do with facts?Is there any such thing
as Methodist mathematics, Presbyterian botany, Catholic astronomy or
Baptist biology?What has any form of superstition or religion to do
with a fact or with any science?Nothing but hinder, delay or embarass.I want, then, to free the schools; and I want to free the politicians,
so that a man will not have to pretend he is a Methodist, or his wife
a Baptist, or his grandmother a Catholic; so that he can go through
a campaign, and when he gets through will find none of the dust of
hypocrisy on his knees.Religion not the End of Life

We deny that religion is the end or object of this life.When it is so
considered it becomes destructive of happiness--the real end of life.It becomes a hydra-headed monster, reaching in terrible coils from the
heavens, and thrusting its thousand fangs into the bleeding, quivering
hearts of men.It devours their substance, builds palaces for God, (who
dwells not in temples made with hands,) and allows his children to
die in huts and hovels.It fills the earth with mourning, heaven with
hatred, the present with fear, and all the future with despair.Creeds

Just in proportion that the human race has advanced, the Church has lost
power.No nation ever materially
advanced that held strictly to the religion of its founders.No nation
ever gave itself wholly to the control of the Church without losing its
power, its honor, and existence.Every Church pretends to have found
the exact truth.Every creed is a rock in running
water; humanity sweeps by it.Every creed cries to the universe, "Halt!"A creed is the ignorant Past bullying the enlightened Present.The Worst Religion in the World

The worst religion of the world was the Presbyterianism of Scotland as
it existed in the beginning of the eighteenth century.The kirk had all
the faults of the church of Rome, without a redeeming feature.The kirk
hated music, painting, statuary, and architecture.Anything touched with
humanity--with the dimples of joy--was detested and accursed.God was
to be feared, not loved.Happiness was a snare, and human love was wicked,
weak, and vain.The Presbyterian priest of Scotland was as cruel,
bigoted, and heartless as the familiar of the inquisition.In the beginning of this, the nineteenth century, a boy
seventeen years of age, Thomas Aikenhead, was indicted and tried
at Edinburgh for blasphemy.He had on several occasions, when cold,
jocularly wished himself in hell, that he might get warm.The poor,
frightened boy recanted--begged for mercy; but he was found guilty,
hanged, thrown in a hole at the foot of the scaffold; and his weeping
mother vainly begged that his bruised and bleeding body might be given
to her.Religion Demanding Miracles

The founder of a religion must be able to turn water into wine--cure
with a word the blind and lame, and raise with a simple touch the dead
to life.It was necessary for him to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of his barbarian disciple, that he was superior to nature.In times of
ignorance this was easy to do.The credulity of the savage was almost
boundless.To him the marvelous was the beautiful, the mysterious was
the sublime.Consequently, every religion has for its foundation a
miracle--that is to say, a violation of nature--that is to say, a
falsehood.We Want One Fact

We have heard talk enough.We have listened to all the drowsy, idealess,
vapid sermons that we wish to hear.We have read your Bible and the
works of your best minds.We have heard your prayers, your solemn groans
and your reverential amens.We beg at the doors of your churches for just one little
fact.We pass our hats along your pews and under your pulpits and
implore you for just one fact.We know all about your mouldy wonders and
your stale miracles.The Design Argument

These religious people see nothing but designs everywhere, and personal,
intelligent interference in everything.They insist that the universe
has been created, and that the adaptation of means to ends is perfectly
apparent.They point us to the sunshine, to the flowers, to the April
rain, and to all there is of beauty and of use in the world.Did it ever
occur to them that a cancer is as beautiful in its development as is the
reddest rose?That what they are pleased to call the adaptation of
means to ends, is as apparent in the cancer as in the April rain?By what ingenious methods the
blood is poisoned so that the cancer shall have food!By what wonderful
contrivances the entire system of man is made to pay tribute to this
divine and charming cancer!See by what admirable instrumentalities it
feeds itself from the surrounding quivering, dainty flesh!See how it
gradually but surely expands and grows!By what marvelous mechanism
it is supplied with long and slender roots that reach out to the most
secret nerves of pain for sustenance and life!Down, Forever Down

Down, forever down, with any religion that requires upon its ignorant
altar the sacrifice of the goddess Reason, that compels her to abdicate
forever the shining throne of the soul, strips from her form the
imperial purple, snatches from her hand the sceptre of thought and makes
her the bondwoman of a senseless faith!The Back

Upon this rack I have described, this victim was placed, and those
chains were attached to his ankles and then to his waist, and clergyman,
good men pious men!men that were shocked at the immorality of their
day!they talked about playing cards and the horrible crime of dancing!how such things shocked them; men going to the theatres and seeing a
play written by the grandest genius the world ever has produced--how it
shocked their sublime and tender souls!but they commenced turning this
machine and they kept on turning until the ankles, knees, hips, elbows,
shoulders and wrists were all dislocated and the victim was red with the
sweat of agony, and they had standing by a physician to feel the pulse,
so that the last faint flutter of life would not leave his veins.simply that they might
have the pleasure of racking him once again.That is the spirit, and it
is a spirit born of the doctrine that there is upon the throne of the
universe a being who will eternally damn his children, and they said:
"If God is going to have the supreme happiness of burning them forever,
certainly he might not to begrudge to us the joy of burning them for an
hour or two."That was their doctrine, and when I read these things it
seems to me that I have suffered them myself.An Awful Admission

Just think of going to the day of judgment, if there is one, and
standing up before God and admitting without a blush that you had lived
and died a Scotch Presbyterian.I would expect the next sentence would
be, "Depart ye curged into everlasting fire."CHURCHES AND PRIESTS




195.The Church Forbids Investigation

The first doubt was the womb and cradle of progress, and from the first
doubt, man has continued to advance.Men began to investigate, and the
church began to oppose.The astronomer scanned the heavens, while the
church branded his grand forehead with the word, "Infidel;" and now,
not a glittering star in all the vast expanse bears a Christian name.In spite of all religion, the geologist penetrated the earth, read her
history in books of stone, and found, hidden within her bosom souvenirs
of all the ages.The Church Charges Falsely

Notwithstanding the fact that infidels in all ages have battled for
the rights of man, and have at all times been the fearless advocates
of liberty and justice, we are constantly charged by the Church with
tearing down without building again.The Church in the "Dark Ages"

During that frightful period known as the "Dark Ages," Faith reigned,
with scarcely a rebellious subject.Her temples were "carpeted with
knees," and the wealth of nations adorned her countless shrines.The
great painters prostituted their genius to immortalize her vagaries,
while the poets enshrined them in song.At her bidding, man covered the
earth with blood.The scales of Justice were turned with her gold, and
for her use were invented all the cunning instruments of pain.She built
cathedrals for God, and dungeons for men.She peopled the clouds with
angels and the earth with slaves.For ages, a deadly conflict has been waged between a few brave men and
women of thought and genius upon the one side, and the great ignorant
religious mass on the other.The few have appealed to reason, to honor, to law, to freedom, to the
known, and to happiness here in this world.The many have appealed
to prejudice, to fear, to miracle, to slavery, to the unknown, and
to misery hereafter.The many have said,
"Believe!"The Church and the Tree of Knowledge

The gods dreaded education and knowledge then just as they do now.The
church still faithfully guards the dangerous tree of knowledge, and has
exerted in all ages her utmost power to keep mankind from eating the
fruit thereof.The priests have never ceased repeating the old falsehood
and the old threat: "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye die."Let the church, or one of its
intellectual saints, perform a miracle, and we will believe.We are told
that nature has a superior.Let this superior, for one single instant,
control nature and we will admit the truth of your assertions.The Heretics Cried, "Halt!"A few infidels--a few heretics cried, "Halt!"to the great rabble of
ignorant devotion, and made it possible for the genius of the nineteenth
century to revolutionize the cruel creeds and superstitions of mankind.The World not so Awful Flat

According to the Christian system this world was the centre of
everything.The stars were made out of what little God happened to have
left when he got the world done.God lived up in the sky, and they said
this earth must rest upon something, and finally science passed its hand
clear under, and there was nothing.It was self-existent in infinite
space.Then the Church began to say they didn't say it was flat, not so
awful flat--it was kind of rounding.According to the ancient Christians God lived from all eternity, and
never worked but six days in His whole life, and then had the impudence
to tell us to be industrious.Christian nations are the warlike nations of this world.Christians have
invented the most destructive weapons of war.Christianity gave us the
revolver, invented the rifle, made the bombshell; and Christian
nations here and there had above all other arts the art of war; and as
Christians they have no respect for the rights of barbarians or for the
rights of any nation or tribe that happens to differ with them.See what
it does in our society; we are divided off into little sects that used
to discuss these questions with fire and sword, with chain and <DW19>,
and that discuss, some of them, even to-day, with misrepresentation and
slander.Every day something happens to show me that the old spirit that
that was in the inquisition still slumbers in the breasts of men.Another Day of Divine Work

I heard of a man going to California over the plains, and there was a
clergyman on board, and he had a great deal to say, and finally he
fell in conversation with the forty-niner, and the latter said to the
clergyman, "Do you believe that God made this world in six days?"They were then going along the Humboldt.Says he, "Don't you think
he could put in another day to advantage right around here?"The Donkey and the Lion

Owing to the attitude of the churches for the last fifteen hundred
years, truth-telling has not been a very lucrative business.As a rule,
hypocrisy has worn the robes, and honesty the rags.You cannot now answer the argument of a man by pointing at
the holes in his coat.Thomas Paine attacked the Church when it was
powerful--when it had what is called honors to bestow--when it was
the keeper of the public conscience--when it was strong and cruel.The
Church waited till he was dead, and then attacked his reputation and his
clothes.Once upon a time a donkey kicked a lion, but the lion was dead.The Orthodox Christian

The highest type of the orthodox Christian does not forget; neither
does he learn.He is a living fossil
embedded in that rock called faith.He makes no effort to better his
condition, because all his strength is exhausted in keeping other people
from improving theirs.The supreme desire of his heart is to force all
others to adopt his creed, and in order to accomplish this object he
denounces free-thinking as a crime, and this crime he calls heresy.When
he had power, heresy was the most terrible and formidable of words.It
meant confiscation, exile, imprisonment, torture, and death.Alms-Dish and Sword

I will not say the Church has been an unmitigated evil in all respects.It has delighted in the production
of extremes.It has furnished murderers for its own martyrs.It has
sometimes fed the body, but has always starved the soul.It has been a
charitable highwayman--a profligate beggar--a generous pirate.It
has produced some angels and a multitude of devils.It has built more
prisons than asylums.It made a hundred orphans while it cared for one.In one hand it has carried the alms-dish and in the other a sword.The Church the Great Robber

The Church has been, and still is, the great robber.She has rifled not
only the pockets but the brains of the world.She is the stone at the
sepulchre of liberty; the upas tree, in whose shade the intellect of man
has withered; the Gorgon beneath whose gaze the human heart has turned
to stone.Under her influence even the Protestant mother expects to be
happy in heaven, while her brave boy, who fell fighting for the rights
of man, shall writhe in hell.The Church Impotent

The Church, impotent and malicious, regrets, not the abuse, but the loss
of her power, and seeks to hold by falsehood what she gained by cruelty
and force, by fire and fear.Christianity cannot live in peace with any
other form of faith.Toleration

Let it be remembered that all churches have persecuted heretics to the
extent of their power.Toleration has increased only when and where the
power of the church has diminished.From Augustine until now the
spirit of the Christians has remained the same.There has been the same
intolerance, the same undying hatred of all who think for themselves,
and the same determination to crush out of the human brain all knowledge
inconsistent with an ignorant creed.Shakespeare's Plays v. Sermons

What would the church people think if the theatrical people should
attempt to suppress the churches?What harm would it do to have an opera
here tonight?It would elevate us more than to hear ten thousand sermons
on the worm that never dies.There is more practical wisdom in one of
the plays of Shakespeare than in all the sacred books ever written.What
wrong would there be to see one of those grand plays on Sunday?There
was a time when the church would not allow you to cook on Sunday.You
had to eat your victuals cold.There was a time they thought the more
miserable you feel the better God feels.Give any orthodox church the power, and to-day they would punish heresy
with whip, and chain, and fire.As long as a church deems a certain
belief essential to salvation, just so long it will kill and burn if it
has the power.Why should the Church pity a man whom her God hates?Why
should she show mercy to a kind and noble heretic whom her God will burn
in eternal fire?Cathedrals and domes, and chimes and chants--temples frescoed and
groined and carved, and gilded with gold--altars and tapers, and
paintings of virgin and babe--censer and chalice--chasuble, paten
and alb--organs, and anthems and incense rising to the winged and
blest--maniple, amice and stole--crosses and crosiers, tiaras
and crowns--mitres and missals and masses--rosaries, relics and
robes--martyrs and saints, and windows stained as with the blood of
Christ--never, never for one moment awed the brave, proud spirit of the
Infidel.He knew that all the pomp and glitter had been purchased with
Liberty--that priceless jewel of the soul.In looking at the cathedral
he remembered the dungeon.The music of the organ was loud enough to
drown the clank of fetters.He could not forget that the taper had
lighted the fagot.He knew that the cross adorned the hilt of the sword,
and so where others worshiped, he wept and scorned.Back to Chaos

Suppose the Church could control the world today, we would go back to
chaos and old night philosophy would be branded as infamous; science
would again press its pale and thoughtful face against the prison bars,
and round the limbs of liberty would climb the bigot's flame.Infinite Impudence of the Church

Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church assuming to think for
the human race?Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church
that pretends to be the mouthpiece of God, and in his name threatens to
inflict eternal punishment upon those who honestly reject its claims and
scorn its pretensions?By what right does a man, or an organization
of men, or a god, claim to hold a brain in bondage?When a fact can be
demonstrated, force is unnecessary; when it cannot be demonstrated, an
appeal to force is infamous.In the presence of the unknown all have an
equal right to think.Wanted!--A New Method

The world is covered with forts to protect Christians from Christians,
and every sea is covered with iron monsters ready to blow Christian
brains into eternal froth.Millions upon millions are annually expended
in the effort to construct still more deadly and terrible engines of
death.Industry is crippled, honest toil is robbed, and even beggary is
taxed to defray the expenses of Christian warfare.There must be some
other way to reform this world.The Kirk of Scotland

The Church was ignorant, bloody, and relentless.In Scotland the "Kirk"
was at the summit of its power.It was a full sister of the Spanish
Inquisition.It was the enemy of
happiness, the hater of joy, and the despiser of religious liberty.It
taught parents to murder their children rather than to allow them to
propagate error.If the mother held opinions of which the infamous
"Kirk" disapproved, her children were taken from her arms, her babe from
her very bosom, and she was not allowed to see them, or to write them a
word.It would not allow shipwrecked sailors to be rescued from drowning
on Sunday.It sought to annihilate pleasure, to pollute the heart by
filling it with religious cruelty and gloom, and to change mankind into
a vast horde of pious, heartless fiends.One of the most famous Scotch
divines said: "The Kirk holds that religious toleration is not far from
blasphemy."The Church Looks Back

The Church is, and always has been, incapable of a forward movement.The Church has already reduced Spain to a
guitar, Italy to a hand-organ, and Ireland to exile.Diogenes

The Church used painting, music and architecture, simply to degrade
mankind.There have been at all
times brave spirits that dared even the gods.Some proud head has always
been above the waves.In every age some Diogenes has sacrificed to all
the gods.True genius never cowers, and there is always some Samson
feeling for the pillars of authority.The Church and War

It does seem as though the most zealous Christian must at times
entertain some doubt as to the divine origin of his religion.For
eighteen hundred years the doctrine has been preached.For more than
a thousand years the Church had, to a great extent, the control of the
civilized world, and what has been the result?Are the Christian nations
patterns of charity and forbearance?On the contrary, their principal
business is to destroy each other.More than five millions of Christians
are trained, educated, and drilled to murder their fellow-christians.Every nation is groaning under a vast debt incurred in carrying on war
against other Christians.The Call to Preach

An old deacon, wishing to get rid of an unpopular preacher, advised him
to give up the ministry and turn his attention to something else.The
preacher replied that he could not conscientiously desert the pulpit, as
he had had a "call" to the ministry.To which the deacon replied, "That
may be so, but it's very unfortunate for you, that when God called you
to preach, he forgot to call anybody to hear you."Burning Servetus

The maker of the Presbyterian creed caused the fugitive Servetus to be
arrested for blasphemy.He was
convicted and condemned to death by fire.On the morning of the fatal
day, Calvin saw him, and Servetus, the victim, asked forgiveness of
Calvin, the murderer.Servetus was bound to the stake, and the <DW19>s
were lighted.The wind carried the flames somewhat away from his body,
so that he slowly roasted for hours.Vainly he implored a speedy death.At last the flames climbed round his form; through smoke and fire his
murderers saw a white, heroic face.And there they watched until a man
became a charred and shriveled mass.Liberty was banished from Geneva,
and nothing but Presbyterianism was left.Freedom for the Clergy

One of the first things I wish to do is to free the orthodox clergy.I
am a great friend of theirs, and in spite of all they may say against
me, I am going to do them a great and lasting service.Upon their necks
are visible the marks of the collar, and upon their backs those of the
lash.They are not allowed to read and think for themselves.They are
taught like parrots, and the best are those who repeat, with the fewest
mistakes, the sentences they have been taught.They sit like owls upon
some dead limb of the tree of knowledge, and hoot the same old hoots
that have been hooted for eighteen hundred years.The Pulpit Weakening

There was a time when a falsehood, fulminated from the pulpit, smote
like a sword; but, the supply having greatly exceeded the demand,
clerical misrepresentation has at last become almost an innocent
amusement.Remembering that only a few years ago men, women, and even
children, were imprisoned, tortured and burned, for having expressed
in an exceedingly mild and gentle way, the ideas entertained by me, I
congratulate myself that calumny is now the pulpit's last resort.Origin of the Priesthood

This was the origin of the priesthood.The priest pretended to stand
between the wrath of the gods and the helplessness of man.He was man's
attorney at the court of heaven.He carried to the invisible world a
flag of truce, a protest and a request.He came back with a command,
with authority and with power.Man fell upon his knees before his own
servant, and the priest, taking advantage of the awe inspired by his
supposed influence with the gods, made of his fellow-man a cringing
hypocrite and slave.The Clergy on Heaven

The clergy, however, balance all the real ills of this life with the
expected joys of the next.We are assured that all is perfection in
heaven--there the skies are cloudless--there all is serenity and peace.Here empires may be overthrown; dynasties may be extinguished in blood;
millions of slaves may toil 'neath the fierce rays of the sun, and the
cruel strokes of the lash; yet all is happiness in heaven.Pestilences
may strew the earth with corpses of the loved; the survivors may bend
above them in agony--yet the placid bosom of heaven is unruffled.Children may expire vainly asking for bread; babes may be devoured by
serpents, while the gods sit smiling in the clouds.The Parson, the Crane and the Fish

A devout clergyman sought every opportunity to impress upon the mind
of his son the fact, that God takes care of all his creatures; that the
falling sparrow attracts his attention, and that his loving-kindness is
over all his works.Happening, one day, to see a crane wading in quest
of food, the good man pointed out to his son the perfect adaptation of
the crane to get his living in that manner."See," said he, "how his
legs are formed for wading!Observe how
nicely he folds his feet when putting them in or drawing them out of
the water!He is thus enabled
to approach the fish without giving them any notice of his arrival.My son," said he, "it is impossible to look at that bird without
recognizing the design, as well as the goodness of God, in thus
providing the means of subsistence.""Yes," replied the boy, "I think I
see the goodness of God, at least so far as the crane is concerned; but,
after all, father, don't you think the arrangement a little tough on the
fish?"Give me the storm of tempest and action, rather than the dead calm of
ignorance and faith.Banish me from Eden when you will; but first let me
eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge!The Pulpit's Cry of Fear

From every pulpit comes the same cry, born of the same fear: "Lest
they eat and become as gods, knowing good and evil."For this reason,
religion hates science, faith detests reason, theology is the sworn
enemy of philosophy, and the church with its flaming sword still guards
the hated tree, and like its supposed founder, curses to the lowest
depths the brave thinkers who eat and become as gods.Restive Clergymen

Some of the clergy have the independence to break away, and the
intellect to maintain themselves as free men, but the most are compelled
to submit to the dictation of the orthodox, and the dead.They are
not employed to give their thoughts, but simply to repeat the ideas of
others.They are not expected to give even the doubts that may suggest
themselves, but are required to walk in the narrow, verdureless path
trodden by the ignorance of the past.The forests and fields on either
side are nothing to them.The Parson Factory at Andover

They have in Massachusetts, at a place called Andover, a kind of
minister-factory; and every professor in that factory takes an oath once
in every five years--that is as long as an oath will last--that not only
has he not during the last five years, but so help him God, he will not
during the next five years intellectually advance; and probably there is
no oath he could easier keep.Since the foundation of that institution
there has not been one case of perjury.They believe the same creed they
first taught when the foundation stone was laid, and now when they send
out a minister they brand him as hardware from Sheffield and Birmingham.And every man who knows where he was educated knows his creed, knows
every argument of his creed, every book that he reads, and just what he
amounts to intellectually, and knows he will shrink and shrivel.A Charge to Presbyteries

Go on, presbyteries and synods, go on!Thrust the heretics out of the
Church--that is to say, throw away your brains,--put out your eyes.Every
deserter from your camp is a recruit for the army of progress.Cling to
the ignorant dogmas of the past; read the 109th Psalm; gloat over the
slaughter of mothers and babes; thank God for total depravity; shower
your honors upon hypocrites, and silence every minister who is touched
with that heresy called genius.Turn out the
astronomers, the geologists, the naturalists, the chemists, and all the
honest scientists.With a whip of scorpions, drive them all out.Nature the True Bible

The true Bible appeals to man in the name of demonstration.It has no fear of being read, of being contradicted,
of being investigated and understood.It does not pretend to be holy, or
sacred; it simply claims to be true.It challenges the scrutiny of
all, and implores every reader to verify every line for himself.It is
incapable of being blasphemed.This book appeals to all the surroundings
of man.Each thing that exists testifies of its perfection.The earth,
with its heart of fire and crowns of snow; with its forests and plains,
its rocks and seas; with its every wave and cloud; with its every leaf
and bud and flower, confirms its every word, and the solemn stars,
shining in the infinite abysses, are the eternal witnesses of its truth.Inspiration

I will tell you what I mean by inspiration.I go and look at the sea,
and the sea says something to me; it makes an impression upon my mind.That impression depends, first, upon my experience; secondly, upon
my intellectual capacity.He has a
different brain, he has had a different experience, he has different
memories and different hopes.The sea may speak to him of joy and to me
of grief and sorrow.The sea cannot tell the same thing to two beings,
because no two human beings have had the same experience.So, when I
look upon a flower, or a star, or a painting, or a statue, the more I
know about sculpture the more that statue speaks to me.The more I have
had of human experience, the more I have read, the greater brain I have,
the more the star says to me.In other words, nature says to me all that
I am capable of understanding.Think of a God wicked and malicious enough to inspire this prayer in
the 109th Psalm.Had this
inspired psalm been found in some temple erected for the worship of
snakes, or in the possession of some cannibal king, written with blood
upon the dried skins of babes, there would have been a perfect harmony
between its surroundings and its sentiments.I Don't Believe the Bible

Now, I read the Bible, and I find that God so loved this world that he
made up his mind to damn the most of us.I have read this book, and what
shall I say of it?I believe it is generally better to be honest.Now,
I don't believe the Bible.They say that if you
do you will regret it when you come to die.If that be true, I know a
great many religious people who will have no cause to regret it--they
don't tell their honest convictions about the Bible.The Bible the Real Persecutor

The Bible was the real persecutor.The Bible burned heretics, built
dungeons, founded the Inquisition, and trampled upon all the liberties
of men.How long, O how long will mankind worship a book?How long will
they grovel in the dust before the ignorant legends of the barbaric
past?How long, O how long will they pursue phantoms in a darkness
deeper than death?Immoralities of the Bible

The believers in the Bible are loud in their denunciation of what they
are pleased to call the immoral literature of the world; and yet few
books have been published containing more moral filth than this inspired
word of God.These stories are not redeemed by a single flash of wit or
humor.They never rise above the dull details of stupid vice.For one,
I cannot afford to soil my pages with extracts from them; and all such
portions of the Scriptures I leave to be examined, written upon, and
explained by the clergy.Clergymen may know some way by which they can
extract honey from these flowers.Until these passages are expunged from
the Old Testament, it is not a fit book to be read by either old or
young.It contains pages that no minister in the United States would
read to his congregation for any reward whatever.There are chapters
that no gentleman would read in the presence of a lady.There are
chapters that no father would read to his child.There are narratives
utterly unfit to be told; and the time will come when mankind will
wonder that such a book was ever called inspired.The Bible Stands in the Way

But as long as the Bible is considered as the work of God, it will be
hard to make all men too good and pure to imitate it; and as long as it
is imitated there will be vile and filthy books.The literature of
our country will not be sweet and clean until the Bible ceases to be
regarded as the production of a god.The Bible False

In the days of Thomas Paine the Church believed and taught that every
word in the Bible was absolutely true.Since his day it has been proven
false in its cosmogony, false in its astronomy, false in its chronology,
false in its history, and so far as the Old Testament is concerned,
false in almost everything.There are but few, if any, scientific men
who apprehend that the Bible is literally true.Who on earth at this
day would pretend to settle any scientific question by a text from
the Bible?The old belief is confined to the ignorant and zealous.The Church itself will before long be driven to occupy the position of
Thomas Paine.The Man I Love

I love any man who gave me, or helped to give me, the liberty I enjoy
to-night.I love every man who helped put our flag in heaven.I love
every man who has lifted his voice in all the ages for liberty, for a
chainless body, and a fetterless brain.I love every man who has given
to every other human being every right that he claimed for himself.I
love every man who thought more of principle than he did of position.I
love the men who have trampled crowns beneath their feet that they might
do something for mankind.Whale, Jonah and All

The best minds of the orthodox world, to-day, are endeavoring to prove
the existence of a personal Deity.You are no longer asked to swallow the Bible whole, whale,
Jonah and all; you are simply required to believe in God, and pay your
pew-rent.There is not now an enlightened minister in the world who will
seriously contend that Samson's strength was in his hair, or that the
necromancers of Egypt could turn water into blood, and pieces of wood
into serpents.Damned for Laughing at Samson

For my part, I would infinitely prefer to know all the results of
scientific investigation, than to be inspired as Moses was.Supposing
the Bible to be true; why is it any worse or more wicked for free
thinkers to deny it, than for priests to deny the doctrine of Evolution,
or the dynamic theory of heat?Why should we be damned for laughing at
Samson and his foxes, while others, holding the Nebular Hypothesis in
utter contempt, go straight to heaven?The Man, Not the Book, Inspired

Now when I come to a book, for instance I read the writings of
Shakespeare--Shakespeare, the greatest human being who ever existed upon
this globe.All that I have sense enough to
understand.Let another read him who knows
nothing of the drama, who knows nothing of the impersonation of passion;
what does he get from him?In other words, every man gets
from a book, a flower, a star, or the sea, what he is able to get from
his intellectual development and experience.Do you then believe that
the Bible is a different book to every human being that receives it?Can God, then, through the Bible, make the same revelation to two
men?Because the man who reads is the man who inspires.Inspiration is in the man and not in the book.The Bible a Chain

The real oppressor, enslaver and corrupter of the people is the Bible.That book is the chain that binds, the dungeon that holds the clergy.That book spreads the pall of superstition over the colleges and
schools.That book puts out the eyes of science, and makes honest
investigation a crime.That book unmans the politician and degrades the
people.That book fills the world with bigotry, hypocrisy and fear.Absurd and Foolish Fables

Volumes might be written upon the infinite absurdity of this most
incredible, wicked and foolish of all the fables contained in that
repository of the impossible, called the Bible.To me it is a matter
of amazement, that it ever was for a moment believed by any intelligent
human being.The Bible the Work of Man

Is it not infinitely more reasonable to say that this book is the work
of man, that it is filled with mingled truth and error, with mistakes
and facts, and reflects, too faithfully perhaps, the "very form and
pressure of its time?"If there are mistakes in the Bible, certainly
they were made by man.If there is anything contrary to nature, it
was written by man.If there is anything immoral, cruel, heartless
or infamous, it certainly was never written by a being worthy of the
adoration of mankind.Something to Admire, not Laugh at

It strikes me that God might write a book that would not necessarily
excite the laughter of his children.In fact, I think it would be
safe to say that a real God could produce a work that would excite the
admiration of mankind.An Intellectual Deformity

The man who now regards the Old Testament as, in any sense, a sacred or
inspired book, is, in my judgment, an intellectual and moral deformity.There is in it so much that is cruel, ignorant, and ferocious, that it
is to me a matter of amazement that it was ever thought to be the work
of a most merciful Deity.The Bible a Poor Product

Admitting that the Bible is the Book of God, is that his only good job?Will not a man be damned as quick for denying the equator as denying
the Bible?Will he not be damned as quick for denying geology as for
denying the scheme of salvation?When the Bible was first written it was
not believed.Had they known as much about science as we know now, that
Bible would not have been written.The Bible the Battle Ground of Sects

Every sect is a certificate that God has not plainly revealed his will
to man.To each reader the Bible conveys a different meaning.About the
meaning of this book, called a revelation, there have been ages of war,
and centuries of sword and flame.If written by an infinite God, he must
have known that these results must follow; and thus knowing, he must be
responsible for all.The Bible Childish

Paine thought the barbarities of the Old Testament inconsistent with
what he deemed the real character of God.He believed that murder,
massacre and indiscriminate slaughter had never been commanded by
the Deity.He regarded much of the Bible as childish, unimportant
and foolish.Paine
attacked the Bible precisely in the same spirit in which he had attacked
the pretensions of kings.All the pomp in the
world could not make him cower.His reason knew no "Holy of Holies,"
except the abode of Truth.Where Moses got the Pentateuch

Nothing can be clearer than that Moses received from the Egyptians the
principal parts of his narrative, making such changes and additions as
were necessary to satisfy the peculiar superstitions of his own people.God's Letter to His Children

According to the theologians, God, the Father of us all, wrote a letter
to his children.The children have always differed somewhat as to the
meaning of this letter.In consequence of these honest differences,
these brothers began to cut out each other's hearts.In every land,
where this letter from God has been read, the children to whom and for
whom it was written have been filled with hatred and malice.They have
imprisoned and murdered each other, and the wives and children of each
other.In the name of God every possible crime has been committed, every
conceivable outrage has been perpetrated.Brave men, tender and loving
women, beautiful girls, and prattling babes have been exterminated in
the name of Jesus Christ.Examination a Crime

The Church has burned honesty and rewarded hypocrisy.And all this,
because it was commanded by a book--a book that men had been taught
implicitly to believe, long before they knew one word that was in it.They had been taught that to doubt the truth of this book--to examine
it, even--was a crime of such enormity that it could not be forgiven,
either in this world or in the next.All that is necessary, as it seems to me, to convince any reasonable
person that the Bible is simply and purely of human invention--of
barbarian invention--is to read it.Read it as you would any other book;
think of it as you would any other; get the bandage of reverence from
your eyes; drive from your heart the phantom of fear; push from the
throne of your brain the cowled form of superstition--then read the Holy
Bible, and you will be amazed that you ever, for one moment, supposed a
being of infinite wisdom, goodness and purity, to be the author of such
ignorance and such atrocity.An Infallible Book Makes Slaves

Whether the Bible is false or true, is of no consequence in comparison
with the mental freedom of the race.Salvation from slavery is inestimable.As long as man
believes the Bible to be infallible, that book is his master.The
civilization of this century is not the child of faith, but of
unbelief--the result of free thought.Can a Sane Man Believe in Inspiration?What man who ever thinks, can believe that blood can appease God?And
yet our entire system of religion is based on that belief.The Jews
pacified Jehovah with the blood of animals, and according to the
Christian system, the blood of Jesus softened the heart of God a little,
and rendered possible the salvation of a fortunate few.It is hard to
conceive how any sane man can read the Bible and still believe in the
doctrine of inspiration.An Inspiration Test

The Bible was originally written in the Hebrew language, and the Hebrew
language at that time had no vowels in writing.It was written entirely
with consonants, and without being divided into chapters and verses, and
there was no system of punctuation whatever.After you go home to-night
write an English sentence or two with only consonants close together,
and you will find that it will take twice as much inspiration to read it
as it did to write it.The Real Bible

The real Bible is not the work of inspired men, nor prophets, nor
evangelists, nor of Christs.The real Bible has not yet been written,
but is being written.Every man who finds a fact adds a word to this
great book.The Bad Passages in the Bible not Inspired

The bad passages in the Bible are not inspired.No God ever upheld
human slavery, polygamy or a war of extermination.No God ever ordered
a soldier to sheathe his sword in the breast of a mother.No God ever
ordered a warrior to butcher a smiling, prattling babe.No God ever said, be subject to the powers that be.No
God ever endeavored to make man a slave and woman a beast of burden.There are thousands of good passages in the Bible.There are in it wise laws, good customs, some lofty and splendid things.And I do not care whether they are inspired or not, so they are true.But what I do insist upon is that the bad is not inspired.Too much Pictorial

There is no hope for you.It is just as bad to deny hell as it is to
deny heaven.The Garden of Eden is pictorial; a pictorial snake and
a pictorial woman, I suppose, and a pictorial man, and may be it was a
pictorial sin.One Plow worth a Million Sermons

Man must learn to rely upon himself.Reading Bibles will not protect
him from the blasts of winter, but houses, fire and clothing will.To
prevent famine one plow is worth a million sermons, and even patent
medicines will cure more diseases than all the prayers uttered since the
beginning of the world.Mary journeyed to the bathroom.The Infidels of 1776

By the efforts of these infidels--Paine, Jefferson and Franklin--the
name of God was left out of the Constitution of the United States.They
knew that if an infinite being was put in, no room would be left for the
people.They knew that if any church was made the mistress of the state,
that mistress, like all others, would corrupt, weaken, and destroy.Washington wished a church, established by law, in Virginia.He was
prevented by Thomas Jefferson.It was only a little while ago that
people were compelled to attend church by law in the Eastern States,
and taxes were raised for the support of churches the same as for the
construction of highways and bridges.The great principle enunciated
in the Constitution has silently repealed most of these laws.In the
presence of this great instrument the constitutions of the States grew
small and mean, and in a few years every law that puts a chain upon the
mind, except in Delaware, will be repealed, and for these our children
may thank the infidels of 1776.The Legitimate Influence of Religion

Religion should have the influence upon mankind that its goodness, that
its morality, its justice, its charity, its reason and its argument give
it, and no more.Religion should have the effect upon mankind that it
necessarily has, and no more.Infidels the Flowers of the World

The infidels have been the brave and thoughtful men; the flower of all
the world; the pioneers and heralds of the blessed day of liberty and
love; the generous spirits of the unworthy past; the seers and
prophets of our race; the great chivalric souls, proud victors on the
battle-fields of thought, the creditors of all the years to be.The Noblest Sons of, Earth

Who at the present day can imagine the courage, the devotion to
principle, the intellectual and moral grandeur it once required to be an
infidel, to brave the Church, her racks, her fagots, her dungeons, her
tongues of fire--to defy and scorn her heaven and her hell--her devil
and her God?They were the noblest sons of earth.They were the real
saviors of our race, the destroyers of superstition, and the creators
of Science.They were the real Titans who bared their grand foreheads to
all the thunderbolts of all the gods.How Ingersoll became an Infidel

I may say right here that the Christian idea that any God can make me
His friend by killing mine is about as great a mistake as could be made.They seem to have the idea that just as soon as God kills all the people
that a person loves, he will then begin to love the Lord.What drew
my attention first to these questions was the doctrine of eternal
punishment.This was so abhorrent to my mind that I began to hate the
book in which it was taught.Then, in reading law, going back to find
the origin of laws, I found one had to go but a little way before the
legislator and priest united.This led me to study a good many of the
religions of the world.At first I was greatly astonished to find most
of them better than ours.I then studied our own system to the best of
my ability, and found that people were palming off upon children
and upon one another as the inspired words of God a book that upheld
slavery, polygamy, and almost every other crime.Whether I am right or
wrong, I became convinced that the Bible is not an inspired book, and
then the only question for me to settle was as to whether I should say
what I believed or not.This realty was not the question in my mind,
because, before even thinking of such a question, I expressed my belief,
and I simply claim that right, and expect to exercise it as long as I
live.I may be damned for it in the next world, but it is a great source
of pleasure to me in this.Why should it be taken for granted that the men who devoted their lives
to the liberation of their fellowmen should have been hissed at in
the hour of death by the snakes of conscience, while men who defended
slavery--practiced polygamy--justified the stealing of babes from the
breasts of mothers, and lashed the naked back of unpaid labor, are
supposed to have passed smilingly from earth to the embraces of the
angels?Why should we think that the brave thinkers, the investigators,
the honest men must have left the crumbling shore of time in dread and
fear, while the instigators of the massacre of St.Bartholomew, the
inventors and users of thumb screws, of iron boots and racks, the
burners and tearers of human flesh, the stealers, the whippers, and the
enslavers of men, the buyers and beaters of maidens, mothers, and babes,
the founders of the inquisition, the makers of chains, the builders of
dungeons, the calumniators of the living, the slanderers of the
dead, and even the murderers of Jesus Christ, all died in the odor of
sanctity, with white, forgiven hands folded upon the breasts of peace,
while the destroyers of prejudice, the breakers of fetters, the creators
of light, died surrounded by the fierce fiends of God?Infidelity is Liberty

Infidelity is liberty; all religion is slavery.In every creed man is
the slave of God--woman is the slave of man and the sweet children are
the slaves of all.We do not want creeds; we want knowledge--we want
happiness.The World in Debt to Infidels

What would the world be if infidels had never been?Did all the priests of Rome increase the mental wealth of man as much
as Bruno?Did all the priests of France do as great a work for the
civilization of the world as Diderot and Voltaire?Did all the ministers
of Scotland add as much to the sum of human knowledge as David Hume?Have all the clergymen, monks, friars, ministers, priests, bishops,
cardinals, and popes, from the day of Pentecost to the last election,
done as much for human liberty as Thomas Paine?Infidels the Pioneers of Progress

The history of intellectual progress is written in the lives of
infidels.Political rights have been preserved by traitors--the liberty
of the mind by heretics.To attack the king was treason--to dispute the
priest was blasphemy.The throne and the altar were twins--vultures from the same
egg.It was James I. who said: "No bishop, no king."He might have said:
"No cross, no crown."The king owned the bodies, and the priest the
souls, of men.One lived on taxes, the other on alms.One was a robber,
the other a beggar.The king made laws, the priest made creeds.With bowed backs the people
received the burdens of the one, and, with wonder's open mouth, the
dogmas of the other.If any aspired to be free, they were slaughtered by
the king, and every priest was a Herod who slaughtered the children
of the brain.The king ruled by force, the priest by fear, and both by
both.The king said to the people: "God made you peasants, and He made
me king.He made rags and hovels for you, robes and palaces for me.And the priest said: "God made you ignorant and
vile.If you do not obey me, God will punish
you here and torment you hereafter.Infidels the Great Discoverers

Infidels are the intellectual discoverers.They sail the unknown seas,
and in the realms of thought they touch the shores of other worlds.An
infidel is the finder of a new fact--one who in the mental sky has seen
another star.He is an intellectual capitalist, and for that reason
excites the envy of theological paupers.The Altar of Reason

Virtue is a subordination, of the passions to the intellect.It is to
act in accordance with your highest convictions.It does not consist in
believing, but in doing.This is the sublime truth that the Infidels in
all ages have uttered.They have handed the torch from one to the other
through all the years that have fled.Upon the altar of reason they have
kept the sacred fire, and through the long midnight of faith they fed
the divine flame.GODS AND DEVILS




275.Every Nation has Created a God

Each nation has created a God, and the God has always resembled his
creators.He hated and loved what they hated and loved.Each God was
intensely patriotic, and detested all nations but his own.All these
gods demanded praise, flattery and worship.Most of them were pleased
with sacrifice, and the smell of innocent blood has ever been considered
a divine perfume.All these gods have insisted on having a vast number
of priests, and the priests have always insisted upon being supported
by the people; and the principle business of these priests has been
to boast that their God could easily vanquish all the other gods put
together.Gods with Back-Hair

Man, having always been the physical superior of woman, accounts for
the fact that most of the high gods have been males.Had women been the
physical superior; the powers supposed to be the rulers of Nature would
have been woman, and instead of being represented in the apparel of man,
they would have luxuriated in trains, low-necked dresses, laces and
back-hair.Creation the Decomposition of the Infinite

Admitting that a god did create the universe, the question then arises,
of what did he create it?Nothing,
considered in the light of a raw material, is a most decided failure.It
follows, then, that the god must have made the universe out of himself,
he being the only existence.The universe is material, and if it was
made of god, the god must have been material.With this very thought in
his mind, Anaximander of Miletus, said: "Creation is the decomposition
of the infinite."The Gods Are as the People Are

No god was ever in advance of the nation that created him.The <DW64>s
represented their deities with black skins and curly hair: The Mongolian
gave to his a yellow complexion and dark almond-shaped eyes.The Jews
were not allowed to paint theirs, or we should have seen Jehovah with
a full beard, an oval face, and an aquiline nose.Zeus was a perfect
Greek, and Jove looked as though a member of the Roman senate.The gods
of Egypt had the patient face and placid look of the loving people who
made them.The gods of northern countries were represented warmly clad
in robes of fur; those of the tropics were naked.The gods of India
were often mounted upon elephants; those of some islanders were great
swimmers, and the deities of the Arctic zone were passionately fond of
whale's blubber.Gods Shouldn't Make Mistakes

Generally the devotee has modeled them after himself, and has given them
hands, heads, feet, eyes, ears, and organs of speech.Each nation made
its gods and devils not only speak its language, but put in their mouths
the same mistakes in history, geography, astronomy, and in all matters
of fact, generally made by the people.Miracles

No one, in the world's whole history, ever attempted to substantiate a
truth by a miracle.Nothing but
falsehood ever attested itself by signs and wonders.No miracle ever was
performed, and no sane man ever thought he had performed one, and until
one is performed, there can be no evidence of the existence of any power
superior to, and independent of nature.Plenty of Gods on Hand

Man has never been at a loss for gods.He has worshipped almost
everything, including the vilest and most disgusting beasts.He has
worshipped fire, earth, air, water, light, stars, and for hundreds, of
ages prostrated himself before enormous snakes.Savage tribes often make
gods of articles they get from civilized people.The Todas worship
a cowbell.The Kodas worship two silver plates, which they regard as
husband and wife, and another tribe manufactured a god out of a king of
hearts.The Devil Difficulty

In the olden times the existence of devils was universally admitted.The
people had no doubt upon that subject, and from such belief it followed
as a matter of course, that a person, in order to vanquish these devils,
had either to be a god, or to be assisted by one.All founders of
religions have established their claims to divine origin by controlling
evil spirits, and suspending the laws of nature.Casting out devils was
a certificate of divinity.A prophet, unable to cope with the powers of
darkness, was regarded with contempt.The utterance of the highest and
noblest sentiments, the most blameless and holy life, commanded but
little respect, unless accompanied by power to work miracles and command
spirits.If he was God, of course
the devil knew that fact, and yet, according to this account, the devil
took the omnipotent God and placed him upon a pinnacle of the temple,
and endeavored to induce him, to dash himself against the earth.Failing
in that, he took the creator, owner and governor of the universe up into
an exceeding high mountain, and offered him this world--this grain of
sand--if he, the God of all the worlds, would fall down and worship
him, a poor devil, without even a tax title to one foot of dirt!Is it
possible the devil was such an idiot?Should any great credit be given
to this deity for not being caught with such chaff?The
devil--the prince of sharpers--the king of cunning--the master of
finesse, trying to bribe God with a grain of sand that belonged to God!Industrious Deities

Few nations have been so poor as to have but one god.Gods were made
so easily, and the raw material cost so little, that generally the god
market was fairly glutted, and heaven crammed with these phantoms.These
gods not only attended to the skies, but were supposed to interfere in
all the affairs of men.All was supposed to be under their
immediate control.Nothing was too small--nothing too large; the falling
of sparrows and the motions of the planets were alike attended to by
these industrious and observing deities.God in Idleness

If a god created the universe, then, there must have been a time when he
commenced to create.Back of that time there must have been an eternity,
during which there had existed nothing--absolutely nothing--except this
supposed god.According to this theory, this god spent an eternity, so
to speak, in an infinite vacuum, and in perfect idleness.Fancy a Devil Drowning a World

One of these gods, according to the account, drowned an entire world,
with the exception of eight persons.The old, the young, the beautiful
and the helpless were remorselessly devoured by the shoreless sea.This,
the most fearful tragedy that the imagination of ignorant priests ever
conceived, was the act, not of a devil, but of a god, so-called, whom
men ignorantly worship unto this day.What a stain such an act would
leave upon the character of a devil!Some Gods Very Particular About Little Things

From their starry thrones they frequently came to the earth for the
purpose of imparting information to man.It is related of one that he
came amid thunderings and lightnings in order to tell the people that
they should not cook a kid in its mother's milk.Some left their shining
abodes to tell women that they should, or should not, have children, to
inform a priest how to cut and wear his apron, and to give directions as
to the proper manner of cleaning the intestines of a bird.288 The Gods of To-day the Scorn of To-morrow

Nations, like individuals, have their periods of youth, of manhood and
decay.The same inexorable destiny awaits them
all.The gods created by the nations must perish with their creators.They were created by men, and like men, they must pass away.The deities
of one age are the by-words of the next.No Evidence of a God in Nature

The best minds, even in the religious world, admit that in the material
nature there is no evidence of what they are pleased to call a god.They find their evidence in the phenomena of intelligence, and very
innocently assert that intelligence is above, and in fact, opposed to
nature.They insist that man, at least, is a special creation; that
he has somewhere in his brain a divine spark, a little portion of the
"Great First Cause."They say that matter cannot produce thought; but
that thought can produce matter.They tell us that man has intelligence,
and therefore there must be an intelligence greater than his.Why not
say, God has intelligence, therefore there must be an intelligence
greater than his?So far as we know, there is no intelligence apart
from matter.We cannot conceive of thought, except as produced within a
brain.Great Variety in Gods

Gods have been manufactured after numberless models., and according to
the most grotesque fashions.Some have a thousand arms, some a hundred
heads, some are adorned with necklaces of living snakes, some are armed
with clubs, some with sword and shield, some with bucklers, and some
have wings as a cherub; some were invisible, some would show themselves
entire, and some would only show their backs; some were jealous, some
were foolish, some turned themselves into men, some into swans, some
into bulls, some into doves, and some into Holy-Ghosts, and made love
to the beautiful daughters of men: Some were married--all ought to have
been--and some were considered as old bachelors from all eternity.Some
had children, and the children were turned into gods and worshiped as
their fathers had been.Most of these gods were revengeful, savage,
lustful, and ignorant.As they generally depended upon their priests for
information, their ignorance can hardly excite our astonishment.God Grows Smaller

"But," says the religionist, "you cannot explain everything; and that
which you cannot explain, that which you do not comprehend, is my God."We are understanding more every day;
consequently your God is growing smaller every day.Give the Devil His Due

If the account given in Genesis is really true, ought we not, after all,
to thank this serpent?He was the first schoolmaster, the first advocate
of learning, the first enemy of ignorance, the first to whisper in human
ears the sacred word liberty, the creator of ambition, the author of
modesty, of inquiry, of doubt, of investigation, of progress and of
civilization.Casting out Devils

Even Christ, the supposed son of God, taught that persons were possessed
of evil spirits, and frequently, according to the account, gave proof of
his divine origin and mission by frightening droves of devils out of his
unfortunate countrymen.Casting out devils was his principal employment,
and the devils thus banished generally took occasion to acknowledge him
as the true Messiah; which was not only very kind of them, but quite
fortunate for him.On the Horns of a Dilemma

The history of religion is simply the story of man's efforts in all ages
to avoid one of two great powers, and to pacify the other.Both powers
have inspired little else than abject fear.The cold, calculating sneer
of the devil, and the frown of God, were equally terrible.In any event,
man's fate was to be arbitrarily fixed forever by an unknown power
superior to all law, and to all fact.The Devil and the Swine

How are you going to prove a miracle?How would you go to work to prove
that the devil entered into a drove of swine?Who saw it, and who would
know a devil if he did see him?Some tell me that it is the desire of God that I should worship Him?If he is in want and I can assist Him and will
not, I would be an ingrate and an infamous wretch.But I am satisfied
that I cannot by any possibility assist the infinite.I can help feed the hungry, clothe the naked, enlighten
ignorance.I can help at least, in some degree, toward covering this
world with a mantle of joy I may be wrong, but I do not believe that
there is any being in this universe who gives rain for praise, who gives
sunshine for prayer, or who blesses a man simply because he kneels.If the infinite "Father" allows a majority of his children to live in
ignorance and wretchedness now, what evidence is there that he will ever
improve their condition?Can the conduct
of infinite wisdom, power and love ever change?Is the infinite capable
of any improvement whatever?According to the theologians, God prepared this globe expressly for the
habitation of his loved children, and yet he filled the forests with
ferocious beasts; placed serpents in every path; stuffed the world
with earthquakes, and adorned its surface with mountains of flame.Notwithstanding all this, we are told that the world is perfect; that
it was created by a perfect being, and is therefore necessarily perfect.The next moment, these same persons will tell us that the world was
cursed; covered with brambles, thistles and thorns, and that man was
doomed to disease and death, simply because our poor, dear mother ate an
apple contrary to the command of an arbitrary God.The Devils better than the Gods

Our ancestors not only had their God-factories, but they made devils
as well.These devils were generally disgraced and fallen gods.These
devils generally sympathized with man.In nearly all the theologies,
mythologies and religions, the devils have been much more humane and
merciful than the gods.No devil ever gave one of his generals an order
to kill children and to rip open the bodies of pregnant women.Such
barbarities were always ordered by the good gods!The pestilences were
sent by the most merciful gods!The frightful famine, during which the
dying child with pallid lips sucked the withered bosom of a dead
mother, was sent by the loving gods.No devil was ever charged with such
fiendish brutality.Is it possible that an infinite God created this world simply to be the
dwelling-place of slaves and serfs?simply for the purpose of raising
orthodox Christians?That he did a few miracles to astonish them; that
all the evils of life are simply his punishments, and that he is finally
going to turn heaven into a kind of religious museum filled with Baptist
barnacles, petrified Presbyterians and Methodist mummies?I want no
heaven for which I must give my reason; no happiness in exchange for
my liberty, and no immortality that demands the surrender of my
individuality.Better rot in the windowless tomb, to which there is no
door but the red mouth of the pallid worm, than wear the jeweled collar
even of a god.It is impossible to conceive of a more thoroughly despicable, hateful,
and arrogant being, than the Jewish god.In the mythology of the world he has no parallel.He, only, is
never touched by agony and tears.He cares neither for love nor music,
beauty nor joy.A false friend, an unjust judge, a braggart, hypocrite,
and tyrant.Compared with Jehovah, Pharaoh was a benefactor, and the
tyranny of Egypt was freedom to those who suffered the liberty of God.HEAVEN AND HELL




302.Hope of a Future Life

For my part I know nothing of any other state of existence, either
before or after this, and I have never become personally acquainted with
anybody who did.There may be another life, and if there is the best
way to prepare for it is by making somebody happy in this.God certainly
cannot afford to put a man in hell who has made a little heaven in this
world.I would like to see how things come
out in this world when I am dead.There are some people I should like to
see again, but if there is no other life I shall never know it.I am Immortal

So far as I am concerned I am immortal; that is to say, I can't
recollect when I did not exist, and there never will be a time when I
will remember that I do not exist.I would like to have several millions
of dollars, and I may say I have a lively hope that some day I may be
rich; but to tell you the truth I have very little evidence of it.Our
hope of immortality does not come from any religions, but nearly all
religions come from that hope.The Old Testament, instead of telling
us that we are immortal, tells us how we lost immortality.You will
recollect that if Adam and Eve could have gotten to the tree of life,
they would have eaten of its fruit and would have lived forever; but for
the purpose of preventing immortality God turned them out of the Garden
of Eden, and put certain angels with swords or sabres at the gate to
keep them from getting back.The Old Testament proves, if it proves
anything, which I do not think it does, that there is no life after
this; and the New Testament is not very specific on the subject.There
were a great many opportunities for the Savior and his apostles to
tell us about another world, but they didn't improve them to any great
extent; and the only evidence so far as I know about another life is,
first, that we have no evidence; and, secondly, that we are rather sorry
that we have not, and wish we had.And suppose, after all, that death does end all.Next to eternal joy,
next to being forever with those we love and those who have loved us,
next to that is to be wrapped in the dreamless drapery of eternal peace.Upon the shadowy shore of death
the sea of trouble casts no wave.Eyes that have been curtained by the
everlasting dark will never know again the touch of tears.Lips that
have been touched by the eternal silence will never utter another word
of grief.And I had
rather think of those I have loved, and those I have lost, as having
returned to earth, as having become a part of the elemental wealth of
the the world.I would rather think of them as unconscious dust.I would
rather think of them as gurgling in the stream, floating in the cloud,
bursting into light upon the shores of worlds.I would rather think
of them thus than to have even a suspicion that their souls had been
clutched by an orthodox God.The Old World Ignorant of Destiny

Moses differed from most of the makers of sacred books by his failure
to say anything of a future life, by failing to promise heaven, and to
threaten hell.Upon the subject of a future state, there is not one
word in the Pentateuch.Probably at that early day God did not deem
it important to make a revelation as to the eternal destiny of man.He seems to have thought that he could control the Jews, at least, by
rewards and punishments in this world, and so he kept the frightful
realities of eternal joy and torment a profound secret from the people
of his choice.He thought it far more important to tell the Jews their
origin than to enlighten them as to their destiny.Where the Doctrine of Hell was born

I honestly believe that the doctrine of hell was born in the glittering
eyes of snakes that run in frightful coils watching for their prey.I
believe it was born in the yelping and howling and growling and snarling
of wild beasts.I believe it was born in the grin of hyenas and in the
malicious clatter of depraved apes.I despise it, I defy it, and I hate
it; and when the great ship freighted with the world goes down in
the night of death, chaos and disaster, I will not be guilty of the
ineffable meanness of pushing from my breast my wife and children and
paddling off in some orthodox canoe.I will go down with those I love
and with those who love me.I will go down with the ship and with my
race.Nothing can make me believe that there is any being that is going to
burn and torment and damn his children forever.The Grand Companionships of Hell

Since hanging has got to be a means of grace, I would prefer hell.I had
a thousand times rather associate with the pagan philosophers than with
the inquisitors of the middle ages.I certainly should prefer the worst
man in Greek or Roman history to John Calvin, and I can imagine no man
in the world that I would not rather sit on the same bench with than the
puritan fathers and the founders of orthodox churches.I would trade off
my harp any minute for a seat in the other country.All the poets will
be in perdition, and the greatest thinkers, and, I should think, most
of the women whose society would tend to increase the happiness of
man, nearly all the painters, nearly all the sculptors, nearly all
the writers of plays, nearly all the great actors, most of the best
musicians, and nearly all the good fellows--the persons who know good
stories, who can sing songs, or who will loan a friend a dollar.They will mostly all be in that country, and if I did not live there
permanently, I certainly would want it so I could spend my winter months
there.Let me put one case and I will be through with this branch of the
subject.The husband is a good
fellow and the wife a splendid woman.They live and love each other and
all at once he is taken sick, and they watch day after day and night
after night around his bedside until their property is wasted and
finally she has to go to work, and she works through eyes blinded with
tears, and the sentinel of love watches at the bedside of her prince,
and at the least breath or the least motion she is awake; and she
attends him night after night and day after day for years, and finally
he dies, and she has him in her arms and covers his wasted face with the
tears of agony and love.He dies, and
she buries him and puts flowers above his grave, and she goes there in
the twilight of evening and she takes her children, and tells her little
boys and girls through her tears how brave and how true and how tender
their father was, and finally she dies and goes to hell, because she was
not a believer; and he goes to the battlements of heaven and looks over
and sees the woman who loved him with all the wealth of her love, and
whose tears made his dead face holy and sacred, and he looks upon her
in the agonies of hell without having his happiness diminished in the
least.With all due respect to everybody I say, damn any such doctrine
as that.The Drama of Damnation

When you come to die, as you look back upon the record of your life, no
matter how many men you have wrecked and ruined, and no matter how many
women you have deceived and deserted--all that may be forgiven you;
but if you recollect that you have laughed at God's book you will see
through the shadows of death, the leering looks of fiends and the forked
tongues of devils.For instance, it
is the day of judgment.When the man is called up by the recording
secretary, or whoever does the cross-examining, he says to his soul:
"Where are you from?""Well, I don't like to talk about myself.""Well, I was a good fellow; I loved
my wife; I loved my children.My home was my heaven; my fireside was my
paradise, and to sit there and see the lights and shadows falling on the
faces of those I love, that to me was a perpetual joy.I never gave one
of them a solitary moment of pain.I don't owe a dollar in the world,
and I left enough to pay my funeral expenses and keep the wolf of want
from the door of the house I loved.That is the kind of a man I am."They were always expecting to be happy simply because somebody else was
to be damned.""Well, did you believe that rib story?"To tell you the
God's truth, that was a little more than I could swallow.""Yes, sir, and to the Young Men's Christian
Association.""Did you
ever run off with any of the money?""I don't like to tell, sir.""What kind of a bank did you have?""How much did you
run off with?""Did you take anything
else along with you?""Did you have a wife and children of your own?""Oh, yes; but such was my confidence in God that I
believed he would take care of them."I believed all of it, sir; I often used to be sorry that there were
not harder stories yet in the Bible, so that I could show what my faith
could do."Annihilation rather than be a God

No God has a right to make a man he intends to drown.Eternal wisdom has
no right to make a poor investment, no right to engage in a speculation
that will not finally pay a dividend.No God has a right to make
a failure, and surely a man who is to be damned forever is not a
conspicuous success.Yet upon love's breast, the Church has placed that
asp; around the child of immortality the Church has coiled the worm that
never dies.For my part I want no heaven, if there is to be a hell.I
would rather be annihilated than be a god and know that one human soul
would have to suffer eternal agony."All that have Red Hair shall be Damned."I admit that most Christians are honest--always have admitted it.I
admit that most ministers are honest, and that they are doing the best
they can in their way for the good of mankind; but their doctrines are
hurtful; they do harm in the world; and I am going to do what I can
against their doctrines.They preach this infamy: "He that believes
shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned."Every word
of that text has been an instrument of torture; every letter in that
text has been a sword thrust into the bleeding and quivering heart of
man; every letter has been a dungeon; every line has been a chain; and
that infamous sentence has covered this world with blood.I deny that
"whoso believes shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be
damned."No man can control his belief; you might as well say, "All that
have red hair shall be damned."The Conscience of a Hyena

But, after all, what I really want to do is to destroy the idea of
eternal punishment.That
doctrine fills hell with honest men, and heaven with intellectual and
moral paupers.That doctrine allows people to sin on a credit.That
doctrine allows the basest to be eternally happy and the most honorable
to suffer eternal pain.I think of all doctrines it is the most
infinitely infamous, and would disgrace the lowest savage, and any man
who believes it, and has imagination enough to understand it, has the
heart of a serpent and the conscience of a hyena.I Leave the Dead

But for me I leave the dead where nature leaves them, and whatever
flower of hope springs up in my heart I will cherish.But I cannot
believe that there is any being in this universe who has created a
soul for eternal pain, and I would rather that every God would destroy
himself, I would rather that we all should go back to the eternal chaos,
to the black and starless night, than that just one soul should suffer
eternal agony.Swedenborg did one thing for which I feel almost grateful.He gave an
account of having met John Calvin in hell.Nothing connected with the
supernatural could be more natural than this.The only thing detracting
from the value of this report is, that if there is a hell, we know
without visiting the place that John Calvin must be there.GOVERNING GREAT MEN




315.Jesus Christ

And let me say here once for all, that for the man Christ I have
infinite respect.Let me say once for all that the place where man has
died for man is holy ground.Let me say once for all, to that great and
serene man I gladly pay--I _gladly_ pay the tribute of my admiration and
my tears.He was an infidel in his
time.He was regarded as a blasphemer, and his life was destroyed by
hypocrites who have in all ages done what they could to trample freedom
out of the human mind.Had I lived at that time I would have been his
friend.And should he come again he will not find a better friend than
I will be.For the theological creation I have
a different feeling.If he was in fact God, he knew there was no such
thing as death; he knew that what we call death was but the eternal
opening of the golden gates of everlasting joy.And it took no heroism
to face a death that was simply eternal life.The Emperor Constantine, who lifted Christianity into power, murdered
his wife Fausta and his eldest son Crispus the same year that he
convened the council of Nice to decide whether Jesus Christ was a man or
the son of God.The council decided that Christ was substantial with
the Father.We are thus indebted to a wife
murderer for settling the vexed question of the divinity of the Savior.Theodosius called a council at Constantinople in 381, and this council
decided that the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father.Theodosius,
the younger, assembled another council at Ephesus to ascertain who the
Virgin Mary really was, and it was solemnly decided in the year 431 that
she was the mother of God.In 451 it was decided by a council held at
Chalcedon, called together by the Emperor Marcian, that Christ had two
natures--the human and divine.In 680, in another general council, held
at Constantinople, convened by order of Pognatius, it was also decided
that Christ had two wills, and in the year 1274 it was decided at the
council of Lyons that the Holy Ghost proceeded not only from the Father,
but from the Son as well.Had it not been for these councils we might
have been without a trinity even unto this day.When we take into
consideration the fact that a belief in the trinity is absolutely
essential to salvation, how unfortunate it was for the world that this
doctrine was not established until the year 1274.Think of the millions
that dropped into hell while these questions were being discussed.The church never has pretended that Jefferson or Franklin died in fear.Franklin wrote no books against the fables of the ancient Jews.He
thought it useless to cast the pearls of thought before the swine of
ignorance and fear.He was the father of a
great party.He gave his views in letters and to trusted friends.He
was a Virginian, author of the Declaration of Independence, founder of a
university, father of a political party, President of the United States,
a statesman and philosopher.He was too powerful for the churches of
his day.Paine was a foreigner, a citizen of the world.He had done these things openly, and what
he had said could not be answered.His arguments were so good that his
character was bad.The Emperor, stained with every crime, is supposed to have died like a
Christian.We hear nothing of fiends leering at him in the shadows of
death.He does not see the forms of his murdered wife and son covered
with the blood he shed.From his white and shriveled lips issued no
shrieks of terror.John went to the hallway.He does not cover his glazed eyes with thin and
trembling hands to shut out the visions of hell.His chamber is filled
with the rustle of wings waiting to bear his soul to the thrilling
realms of joy.Against the Emperor Constantine the church has hurled no
anathema.She has accepted the story of his vision in the clouds, and
his holy memory has been guarded by priest and pope.Diderot

Diderot was born in 1713.His parents were in what may be called the
humbler walks of life.Like Voltaire, he was educated by the Jesuits.He
had in him something of the vagabond, and was for several years almost a
beggar in Paris.He was endeavoring to live by his pen.In that day and
generation a man without a patron, endeavoring to live by literature,
was necessarily almost a beggar.He nearly starved--frequently going
for days without food.Afterward, when he had something himself, he was
generous as the air.No man ever was more willing to give, and no man
less willing to receive, than Diderot.His motto was, "Incredulity
is the first step toward philosophy."He had the vices of most
Christians--was nearly as immoral as the majority of priests.His vices
he shared in common--his virtues were his own--All who knew him united
in saying that he had the pity of a woman, the generosity of a prince,
the self-denial of an anchorite, the courage of Caesar, an insatiate
thirst foi knowledge, and the enthusiasm of a poet.He attacked with
every power of his mind the superstition of his day.He was in favor of universal
education--the church despised it.He wished to put the knowledge of
the whole world within reach of the poorest.He wished to drive from
the gate of the Garden of Eden the cherubim of superstition, so that
the child of Adam might return to eat once more the fruit of the tree
of knowledge.His poor little desk was
ransacked by the police, searching for manuscripts in which something
might be found that would justify the imprisonment of such a dangerous
man.Whoever, in 1750, wished to increase the knowledge of mankind was
regarded as the enemy of social order.Benedict Spinoza

One of the greatest thinkers of the world was Benedict Spinoza--a Jew,
born at Amsterdam in 1638.He asked the rabbis so many questions, and insisted to such a degree on
what he called reason, that his room was preferred to his company.His Jewish brethren excommunicated him from the synagogue.Under the
terrible curse of their religion he was made an outcast from every
Jewish home.His own father could not give him shelter, and his mother,
after the curse had been pronounced, could not give him bread, could not
even speak to him, without becoming an outcast herself.All the cruelty
of Jehovah was in this curse.Spinoza was but twenty-four years old
when he found himself without friends and without kindred.He earned his bread with willing hands, and cheerfully
divided his poor crust with those below.He tried to solve the problem
of existence.According to him the universe did not commence to
be.It is; from eternity it was; and to eternity it will be.He insisted
that God is inside, not outside, of what we call substance.Thomas Paine

Poverty was his mother--Necessity his master.He had more brains than
books; more sense than education; more courage than politeness;
more strength than polish.He had no veneration for old mistakes--no
admiration for ancient lies.He loved the truth for the truth's
sake, and for man's sake.He saw oppression on every hand; injustice
everywhere; hypocrisy at the altar, venality on the bench, tyranny on
the throne; and with a splendid courage he espoused the cause of the
weak against the strong--of the enslaved many against the titled few.The Greatest of all Political Writers

In my judgment, Thomas Paine was the best political writer that ever
lived."What he wrote was pure nature, and his soul and his pen ever
went together."Ceremony, pageantry, and all the paraphernalia of
power, had no effect upon him.He examined into the why and wherefore of
things.He was perfectly radical in his mode of thought.Nothing short
of the bed-rock satisfied him.His enthusiasm for what he believed to
be right knew no bounds.During all the dark scenes of the Revolution,
never for one moment did he despair.Year after year his brave words
were ringing through the land, and by the bivouac fires the weary
soldiers read the inspiring words of "Common Sense," filled with ideas
sharper than their swords, and consecrated themselves anew to the cause
of Freedom.The Writings of Paine

The writings of Paine are gemmed with compact statements that carry
conviction to the dullest.Day and night he labored for America, until
there was a government of the people and for the people.At the close
of the Revolution no one stood higher than Thomas Paine.Had he been
willing to live a hypocrite, he would have been respectable, he at least
could have died surrounded by other hypocrites, and at his death there
would have been an imposing funeral, with miles of carriages, filled
with hypocrites, and above his hypocritical dust there would have been a
hypocritical monument covered with lies.The truth is, he died as he had lived.Some ministers were impolite
enough to visit him against his will.Several of them he ordered
from his room.A couple of Catholic priests, in all the meekness of
hypocrisy, called that they might enjoy the agonies of a dying friend
of man.Thomas Paine, rising in his bed, the few embers of expiring life
blown into flame by the breath of indignation, had the goodness to curse
them both.His physician, who seems to have been a meddling fool, just
as the cold hand of death was touching the patriot's heart, whispered
in the dull ear of the dying man: "Do you believe, or do you wish to
believe, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?"And the reply was: "I
have no wish to believe on that subject."These were the last remembered
words of Thomas Paine.He died as serenely as ever Christian passed
away.He died in the full possession of his mind, and on the very brink
and edge of death proclaimed the doctrines of his life.Paine Believed in God

Thomas Paine was a champion in both hemispheres of human liberty; one of
the founders and fathers of the Republic; one of the foremost men of his
age.He never wrote a word in favor of injustice.He was a despiser of
slavery.He wast in the widest and
best sense, a friend of all his race.His head was as clear as his heart
was good, and he had the courage to speak his honest thought.He was
the first man to write these words: "The United States of America."He furnished every thought
that now glitters in the Declaration of Independence.He believed in one
God and no more.He was a believer even in special providence, and he
hoped for immortality.The Intellectual Hera

Thomas Paine was one of the intellectual heroes--one of the men to whom
we are indebted.His name is associated forever with the Great Republic.As long as free government exists he will be remembered, admired and
honored.He lived a long, laborious and useful life.The world is better
for his having lived.For the sake of truth he accepted hatred and
reproach for his portion.His friends
were untrue to him because he was true to himself, and true to them.He
lost the respect of what is called society, but kept his own.His life
is what the world calls failure and what history calls success.If to
love your fellow-men more than self is goodness, Thomas Paine was good.If to be in advance of your time--to be a pioneer in the direction of
right--is greatness.If to avow your principles and discharge your
duty in the presence of death is heroic, Thomas Paine was a hero.At the
age of seventy-three, death touched his tired heart.He died in the land
his genius defended--under the flag he gave to the skies.Slander cannot
touch him now--hatred cannot reach him more.He sleeps in the sanctuary
of the tomb, beneath the quiet of the stars.Paine, Franklin, Jefferson

In our country there were three infidels--Paine, Franklin and Jefferson.The colonies were full of superstition, the Puritans with the spirit
of persecution.Laws savage, ignorant, and malignant had been passed in
every colony for the purpose of destroying intellectual liberty.The toleration acts of
Maryland tolerated only Christians--not infidels, not thinkers, not
investigators.The charity of Roger Williams was not extended to those
who denied the Bible, or suspected the divinity of Christ.It was not
based upon the rights of man, but upon the rights of believers, who
differed in non-essential points.David Hume

On the 26th of April, 1711, David Hume was born.David Hume was one of
the few Scotchmen of his day who were not owned by the church.He had
the manliness to examine historical and religious questions for himself,
and the courage to give his conclusions to the world.He was singularly
capable of governing himself.He was a philosopher, and lived a calm
and cheerful life, unstained by an unjust act, free from all excess,
and devoted in a reasonable degree to benefiting his fellow-men.After
examining the Bible he became convinced that it was not true.For
failing to suppress his real opinion, for failing to tell a deliberate
falsehood, he brought upon him the hatred of the church.Voltaire

Voltaire was the intellectual autocrat of his time.From his throne at
the foot of the Alps he pointed the finger of scorn at every hypocrite
in Europe.He left the quiver of ridicule without an arrow.He was the
pioneer of his century.Through the
shadows of faith and fable, through the darkness of myth and miracle,
through the midnight of Christianity, through the blackness of bigotry,
past cathedral and dungeon, past rack and stake, past altar and throne,
he carried, with brave and chivalric hands, the torch of reason.John Calvin

Calvin was of a pallid, bloodless complexion, thin, sickly, irritable,
gloomy, impatient, egotistic, tyrannical, heartless, and infamous.He
was a strange compound of revengeful morality, malicious forgiveness,
ferocious charity, egotistic humility, and a kind of hellish justice.In other words, he was as near like the God of the Old Testament as his
health permitted.Calvin's Five Fetters

This man forged five fetters for the brain.That is to say, predestination, particular redemption, total
depravity, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints.About
the neck of each follower he put a collar bristling with these five iron
points.The presence of all these points on the collar is still the test
of orthodoxy in the church he founded.This man, when in the flush of
youth, was elected to the office of preacher in Geneva.He at once,
in union with Farel, drew up a condensed statement of the Presbyterian
doctrine, and all the citizens of Geneva, on pain of banishment, were
compelled to take an oath that they believed this statement.Of this
proceeding Calvin very innocently remarked that it produced great
satisfaction.A man named Caroli had the audacity to dispute with
Calvin.Humboldt

Humboldt breathed the atmosphere of investigation.Old ideas were
abandoned; old creeds, hallowed by centuries, were thrown aside; thought
became courageous; the athlete, Reason, challenged to mortal combat the
monsters of superstition.Humbolt's Travels

Europe becoming too small for his genius, he visited the tropics.He
sailed along the gigantic Amazon--the mysterious Orinoco--traversed the
Pampas--climbed the Andes until he stood upon the crags of Chimborazo,
more than eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, and climbed
on until blood flowed from his eyes and lips.For nearly five years he
pursued his investigations in the new world, accompanied by the intrepid
Bonplandi.He was the best intellectual
organ of these new revelations of science.He was calm, reflective and
eloquent; filled with a sense of the beautiful, and the love of truth.His collections were immense, and valuable beyond calculation to every
science.He endured innumerable hardships, braved countless dangers in
unknown and savage lands, and exhausted his fortune for the advancement
of true learning.Humboldt's Illustrious Companions

Humboldt was the friend and companion of the greatest poets, historians,
philologists, artists, statesmen, critics, and logicians of his time.He was the companion of Schiller, who believed that man would be
regenerated through the influence of the Beautiful of Goethe, the grand
patriarch of German literature; of Weiland, who has been called
the Voltaire of Germany; of Herder, who wrote the outlines of a
philosophical history of man; of Kotzebue, who lived in the world of
romance; of Schleiermacher, the pantheist; of Schlegel, who gave to
his countrymen the enchanted realm of Shakespeare; of the sublime Kant,
author of the first work published in Germany on Pure Reason; of Fichte,
the infinite idealist; of Schopenhauer, the European Buddhist who
followed the great Gautama to the painless and dreamless Nirwana, and
of hundreds of others, whose names are familiar to and honored by the
scientific world.Humboldt the Apostle of Science

Upon his return to Europe he was hailed as the second Columbus; as the
scientific discover of America; as the revealer of a new world; as the
great demonstrator of the sublime truth, that the universe is governed
by law.I have seen a picture of the old man, sitting upon a mountain
side--above him the eternal snow--below, the smiling valley of the
tropics, filled with vine and palm; his chin upon his breast, his
eyes deep, thoughtful and calm his forehead majestic--grander than the
mountain upon which he sat--crowned with the snow of his whitened hair,
he looked the intellectual autocrat of this world.Not satisfied with
his discoveries in America, he crossed the steppes of Asia, the wastes
of

Siberia, the great Ural range adding to the knowledge of mankind at
every step.H is energy acknowledged no obstacle, his life knew no
leisure; every day was filled with labor and with thought.He was one
of the apostles of science, and he served his divine master with
a self-sacrificing zeal that knew no abatement; with an ardor that
constantly increased, and with a devotion unwavering and constant as the
polar star.Ingersoll Muses by Napoleon's Tomb

A little while ago I stood by the grave of the old Napoleon--a
magnificent tomb of gilt and gold, fit almost for a dead deity--and
gazed upon the sarcophagus of black Egyptian marble, where rest at last
the ashes of the restless man.I leaned over the balustrade and thought
about the career of the greatest soldier of the modern world.I saw him
walking upon the banks of the Seine, contemplating suicide--I saw him
at Toulon--I saw him putting down the mob in the streets of Paris--I saw
him at the head of the army of Italy--I saw him crossing the bridge of
Lodi with the tri-color in his hand--I saw him in Egypt in the shadows
of the pyramids--I saw him conquer the Alps and mingle the eagles of
France with the eagles of the crags.I saw him at Marengo--at Ulm and
Austerlitz.I saw him in Russia, where the infantry of the snow and the
cavalry of the wild blast scattered his legions like Winter's withered
leaves.I saw him at Leipsic in defeat and disaster--driven by a million
bayonets back upon Paris--clutched like a wild beast--banished to Elba.I saw him escape and retake an empire by the force of his genius.I saw
him upon the frightful field of Waterloo, where chance and fate combined
to wreck the fortunes of their former king.Helena,
with his hands crossed behind him, gazing out upon the sad and solemn
sea.I thought of the orphans and widows he had made--of the tears that
had been shed for his glory, and of the only woman who ever loved him,
pushed from his heart by the cold hand of ambition.And I said I would
rather have been a French peasant, and worn wooden shoes.I would rather
have lived in a hut with a vine growing over the door, and the grapes
growing purple in the kisses of the Autumn sun.I would rather have been
that poor peasant with my loving wife by my side, knitting as the day
died out of the sky--with my children upon my knees and their arms about
me; I would rather have been that man and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust, than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder known as Napoleon the Great.And so I
would, ten thousand times.Eulogy on J. G. Blaine

This is a grand year--a year filled with recollections of the
Revolution; filled with the proud and tender memories of the past; with
the sacred legends of liberty; a year in which the sons of freedom will
drink from the fountains of enthusiasm; a year in which the people call
for a man who has preserved in Congress what our soldiers won upon
the field; a year in which they call for the man who has torn from the
throat of treason the tongue of slander--for the man who has snatched
the mask of Democracy from the hideous face of rebellion; for this man
who, like an intellectual athlete, has stood in the arena of debate and
challenged all comers, and who is still a total stranger to defeat.Like
an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine marched down the
halls of the American Congress and threw his shining lance full and
fair against the brazen foreheads of the defamers of his country and the
maligners of her honor.For the Republican party to desert this gallant
leader now is as though an army should desert their General upon the
field of battle.James G. Blaine is now and has been for years the
bearer of the sacred standard of the Republican party.A Model Leader

The Republicans of the United States want a man who knows that this
Government should protect every citizen, at home and abroad; who knows
that any Government that will not defend its defenders and protect its
protectors is a disgrace to the map of the world.They demand a man who
believes in the eternal separation and divorcement of church and school.They demand a man whose political reputation is as spotless as a star;
but they do not demand that their candidate shall have a certificate of
moral character signed by a Confederate Congress.The man who has, in
full, heaped and rounded measure, all these splendid qualifications is
the present grand and gallant leader of the Republican party--James G.
Blaine.Our country, crowned with the vast and marvelous achievements
of its first century, asks for a man worthy of the past and prophetic
of her future; asks for a man who has the audacity of genius; asks for
a man who is the grandest combination of heart, conscience and brain
beneath her flag.Such a man is James G. Blaine.Abraham Lincoln

This world has not been fit to live in fifty years.There is no liberty
in it--very little.Why, it is only a few years ago that all the
Christian nations were engaged in the slave trade.It was not until 1808
that England abolished the slave trade, and up to that time her priests
in her churches and her judges on her benches owned stock in slave
ships, and luxuriated on the profits of piracy and murder; and when a
man stood up and denounced it they mobbed him as though he had been a
common burglar or a horse thief.It was not until the 28th
day of August, 1833, that England abolished slavery in her colonies; and
it was not until the 1st day of January, 1862, that Abraham Lincoln, by
direction of the entire North, wiped that infamy out of this country;
and I never speak of Abraham Lincoln but I want to say that he was, in
my judgment, in many respects the grandest man ever President of the
United States.I say that upon his tomb there ought to be this line--and
I know of no other man deserving it so well as he: "Here lies one who
having been clothed with almost absolute power never abused it except on
the side of mercy."Swedenborg

Swedenborg was a man of great intellect, of vast acquirements, and of
honest intentions; and I think it equally clear that upon one subject,
at least, his mind was touched, shattered and shaken.Misled by
analogies, imposed upon by the bishop, deceived by the woman, borne to
other worlds upon the wings of dreams, living in the twilight of reason
and the dawn of insanity, he regarded every fact as a patched and ragged
garment with a lining of the costliest silk, and insisted that the wrong
side, even of the silk, was far more beautiful than the right.Jeremy Bentham

The glory of Bentham is, that he gave the true basis of morals, and
furnished the statesmen with the star and compass of this sentence: "The
greatest happiness of the greatest number."Charles Fourier

Fourier sustained about the same relation to this world that Swedenborg
did to the other.There must be something wrong about the brain of one
who solemnly asserts that "the elephant, the ox and the diamond were
created by the Sun; the horse, the lily, and the ruby, by Saturn; the
cow, the jonquil and the topaz, by Jupiter; and the dog, the violet
and the opal stones by the earth itself."And yet, forgetting these
aberrations of the mind, this lunacy of a great and loving soul, for
one, that's in tender-est regard the memory of Charles Fourier, one of
the best and noblest of our race.Auguste Comte

There was in the brain of the great Frenchman--Auguste Comte--the dawn
of that happy day in which humanity will be the only religion, good the
only God, happiness the only object, restitution the only atonement,
mistake the only sin, and affection guided by intelligence, the only
savior of mankind.This dawn enriched his poverty, illuminated the
darkness of his life, peopled his loneliness with the happy millions yet
to be, and filled his eyes with proud and tender tears.When everything
connected with Napoleon, except his crimes, shall be forgotten, Auguste
Comte will be lovingly remembered as a benefactor of the human race.Herbert Spencer

Herbert Spencer relies upon evidence, upon demonstration, upon
experience; and occupies himself with one world at a time.He perceives
that there is a mental horizon that we cannot pierce, and that beyond
that is the unknown, possibly the unknowable.He endeavors to examine
only that which is capable of being examined, and considers the
theological method as not only useless, but hurtful.After all God is
but a guess, throned and established by arrogance and assertion.Turning his attention to those things that have in some way affected
the condition of mankind, Spencer leaves the unknowable to priests and
believers.Robert Collyer

I have the honor of a slight acquaintance with Robert Collyer.I have
read with pleasure some of his exquisite productions.He has a brain
full of the dawn, the head of a philosopher, the imagination of a poet
and the sincere heart of a child.Had such men as Robert Collyer and
John Stuart Mill been present at the burning of Servetus, they would
have extinguished the flames with their tears.Had the presbytery of
Chicago been there, they would have quietly turned their backs, solemnly
divided their coat tails, and warmed themselves.John Milton

England was filled with Puritan gloom and Episcopal ceremony.All
religious conceptions were of the grossest nature.The ideas of crazy
fanatics and extravagant poets were taken as sober facts.Milton had
clothed Christianity in the soiled and faded finery of the gods--had
added to the story of Christ the fables of Mythology, He gave to the
Protestant Church the most outrageously material ideas of the Deity.He turned all the angels into soldiers--made heaven a battlefield, put
Christ in uniform, and described God as a militia general.His works
were considered by the Protestants nearly as sacred as the Bible
itself, and the imagination of the people was thoroughly polluted by the
horrible imagery, the sublime absurdity of the blind Milton.Ernst Haeckel

Amongst the bravest, side by side with the greatest of the world in
Germany, the land of science--stands Ernst Haeckel, who may be said
not only to have demonstrated the theories of Darwin, but the monistic
conception of the world.He has endeavored--and I think with complete
success--to show that there is not, and never was, and never can be,
the creator of anything.Haeckel is one of the bitterest enemies of the
church, and is, therefore, one of the bravest friends of man.Professor Swing, a Dove amongst Vultures

Professor Swing was too good a man to stay in the Presbyterian Church.He was a rose amongst thistles; he was a dove amongst vultures; and they
hunted him out, and I am glad he came out.I have the greatest respect
for Professor Swing, but I want him to tell whether the 109th Psalm is
inspired.Queen Victoria and George Eliot

Compare George Eliot with Queen Victoria.The Queen is clad in garments
given her by blind fortune and unreasoning chance, while George Eliot
wears robes of glory woven in the loom of her own genius.The time is coming when men will be rated at their real
worth; when we shall care nothing for an officer if he does not fill his
place.Bough on Rabbi Bien

I will not answer Rabbi Bien, and I will tell you why.Because he has
taken himself outside of all the limits of a gentleman; because he has
taken upon himself to traduce American women in language the beastliest
I ever read; and any man who says that the American women are not just
as good women as any God can make, and pick his mind to-day, is an
unappreciative barbarian.I will let him alone because he denounced all
the men in this country, all the members of Congress, all the members
of the Senate, all the Judges on the bench, as thieves and robbers.I
pronounce him a vulgar falsifier, and let him alone.General Garfield

No man has been nominated for the office since I was born, by either
party, who had more brains and more heart than James A. Garfield.He
was a soldier, he is a statesman.In time of peace he preferred the
avocations of peace; when the bugle of war blew in his ears he withdrew
from his work and fought for the flag, and then he went back to the
avocation of peace.And I say to-day that a man who, in a time of
profound peace, makes up his mind that he would like to kill folks for
a living is no better, to say the least of it, than the man who loves
peace in the time of peace, and who, when his country is attacked,
rushes to the rescue of her flag."Wealthy in Integrity; In Brain a Millionaire."James A. Garfield is to-day a poor man, and you know that there is not
money enough in this magnificent street to buy the honor and manhood of
James A. Garfield.Money cannot make such a man, and I will swear to you
that money cannot buy him.James A. Garfield to-day wears the glorious
robe of honest poverty.He is a poor man; but I like to say it here in
Wall street; I like to say it surrounded by the millions of America; I
like to say it in the midst of banks, and bonds, and stocks; I love to
say it where gold is piled--that, although a poor man, he is rich in
honor, in integrity he is wealthy, and in brain he is a millionaire.Garfield a Certificate of the Splendor of the American Constitution

Garfield is a certificate of the splendor of our Government, that says
to every poor boy: "All the avenues of honor are open to you."He is a scholar; he is a statesman; he was a
soldier; he is a patriot; and above all he is a magnificent man, and if
every man in New York knew him as well as I do, Garfield would not lose
a hundred votes in this city.W. Hiram Thomas

The best thing that has come from the other side is from Dr.I
regard him as by far the grandest intellect in the Methodist Church.He
is intellectually a wide and tender man.I cannot conceive of an article
being written in a better spirit.He finds a little fault with me for
not being exactly fair.Thomas
the probability is I never should have laid myself liable to criticism.There is some human nature in me, and I find it exceedingly difficult
to preserve at all times perfect serenity.I have the greatest possible
respect for Dr.Thomas, and must heartily thank him for his perfect
fairness.MISCELLANEOUS




355.Heresy and Orthodoxy

It has always been the man ahead that has been called the heretic.Heresy is the last and best thought always!Heresy extends the
hospitality of the brain to a new idea; that is what the rotting says to
flax growing; that is what the dweller in the swamp says to the man on
the sun-lit hill; that is what the man in the darkness cries out to the
grand man upon whose forehead is shining the dawn of a grander day; that
is what the coffin says to the cradle.Orthodoxy is a kind of shroud,
and heresy is a banner--Orthodoxy is a fog and Heresy a star shining
forever upon the cradle of truth.I do not mean simply in religion, I
mean in everything and the idea I wish to impress upon you is that you
should keep your minds open to all the influences of nature, you should
keep your minds open to reason; hear what a man has to say, and do not
let the turtle-shell of bigotry grow above your brain.Give everybody a
chance and an opportunity; that is all.We used to worship the golden calf, and the worst you can say of us now,
is, we worship the gold of the calf, and even the calves are beginning
to see this distinction.We used to go down on our knees to every man
that held office, now he must fill it if he wishes any respect.We care
nothing for the rich, except what will they do with their money?How does he fill it?--that is the question.And there is rapidly growing
up in the world an aristocracy of heart and brain--the only aristocracy
that has a right to exist.Truth will Bear the Test

If a man has a diamond that has been examined by the lapidaries of the
world, and some ignorant stonecutter told him that it is nothing but
an ordinary rock, he laughs at him; but if it has not been examined
by lapidaries, and he is a little suspicious himself that it is not
genuine, it makes him mad.Any doctrine that will not bear investigation
is not a fit tenant for the mind of an honest man.Any man who is afraid
to have his doctrine investigated is not only a coward but a hypocrite.Paring Nails

Why should we in this age of the world be dominated by the dead?Why
should barbarian Jews who went down to death and dust three thousand
years ago, control the living world?Why should we care for the
superstition of men who began the sabbath by paring their nails,
"beginning at the fourth finger, then going to the second, then to the
fifth, then to the third, and ending with the thumb?"How pleasing to
God this must have been.There may be a God

There may be for aught I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast,
some being whose dreams are constellations and within whose thought the
infinite exists.About this being, if such an one exists, I have nothing
to say.He has written no books, inspired no barbarians, required no
worship, and has prepared no hell in which to burn the honest seeker
after truth.The People are Beginning to Think

The people are beginning to think, to reason and to investigate.Slowly,
painfully, but surely, the gods are being driven from the earth.Only
upon rare occasions are they, even by the most religious, supposed to
interfere in the affairs of men.In most matters we are at last supposed
to be free.Since the invention of steamships and railways, so that the
products of all countries can be easily interchanged, the gods have quit
the business of producing famine.Unchained Thought

For the vagaries of the clouds the infidels propose to substitute the
realities of earth; for superstition, the splendid demonstrations and
achievements of science; and for theological tyranny, the chainless
liberty of thought.Man the Victor of the Future

If abuses are destroyed, man must destroy them.If slaves are freed, man
must free them.If new truths are discovered, man must discover them.If the naked are clothed; if the hungry are fed; if justice is done;
if labor is rewarded; if superstition is driven from the mind; if the
defenseless are protected, and if the right finally triumphs, all must
be the work of man.The grand victories of the future must be won by
man, and by man alone.The Sacred Sabbath

Of all the superstitious of mankind, this insanity about the "sacred
Sabbath" is the most absurd.The idea of feeling it a duty to be solemn
and sad one-seventh of the time!To think that we can please an infinite
being by staying in some dark and sombre room, instead of walking in the
perfumed fields!Why should God hate to see a man happy?Why should it
excite his wrath to see a family in the woods, by some babbling stream,
talking, laughing and loving?Nature works on that "sacred" day.The
earth turns, the rivers run, the trees grow, buds burst into flower, and
birds fill the air with song.Why should we look sad, and think about
death, and hear about-hell?Why should that day be filled with gloom
instead of joy?Make the Sabbath Merry

Freethinkers should make the Sabbath a day of mirth and music; a day to
spend with wife and child--a day of games, and books, and dreams--a day
to put fresh flowers above our sleeping dead--a day of memory and hope,
of love and rest.Away to the Hills and the Sea

A poor mechanic, working all the week in dust and noise, needs a day of
rest and joy, a day to visit stream and wood--a day to live with wife
and child; a day in which to laugh at care, and gather hope and strength
for toils to come.And his weary wife needs a breath of sunny air, away
from street and wall, amid the hills or by the margin of the sea, where
she can sit and prattle with her babe, and fill with happy dreams the
long, glad day.Melancholy Sundays

When I was a little fellow most everybody thought that some days were
too sacred for the young ones to enjoy themselves in.Sunday used to commence Saturday night at sundown, under
the old text, "The evening and the morning were the first day."They
commenced then, I think, to get a good ready.When the sun went down
Saturday night, darkness ten thousand times deeper than ordinary night
fell upon that house.The boy that looked the sickest was regarded as
the most pious.You could not crack hickory nuts that night, and if you
were caught chewing gum it was another evidence of the total depravity
of the human heart.We would sometimes
sing, "Another day has passed."Everybody looked as though they had the
dyspesia--you know lots of people think they are pious, just because
they are bilious, as Mr.It was a solemn night, and the next
morning the solemnity had increased.Then we went to church, and the
minister was in a pulpit about twenty feet high.If it was in the winter
there was no fire; it was not thought proper to be comfortable while you
were thanking the Lord.The minister commenced at firstly and ran up to
about twenty-fourthly, and then he divided it up again; and then he
made some concluding remarks, and then he said lastly, and when he said
lastly he was about half through.Moses took Egyptian Law for his Model

It has been contended for many years that the ten commandments are the
foundation of all ideas of justice and of law.Eminent jurists have
bowed to popular prejudice, and deformed their works by statements to
the effect that the Mosaic laws are the fountains from which sprang all
ideas of right and wrong.Nothing can be more stupidly false than such
assertions.Thousands of years before Moses was born, the Egyptians
had a code of laws.They had laws against blasphemy, murder, adultery,
larceny, perjury, laws for the collection of debts, and the enforcement
of contracts.A False Standard of Success

It is not necessary to be rich, nor powerful, nor great, to be a
success; and neither is it necessary to have your name between the
putrid lips of rumor to be great.We have had a false standard of
success.In the years when I was a little boy we read in our books that
no fellow was a success that did not make a fortune or get a big office,
and he generally was a man that slept about three hours a night.They
never put down in the books the gentlemen who succeeded in life and yet
slept all they wanted to.Toilers and Idlers

You can divide mankind into two classes: the laborers and the idlers,
the supporters and the supported, the honest and the dishonest.Every
man is dishonest who lives upon the unpaid labor of others, no matter
if he occupies a throne.The laborers
should have equal-rights before the world and before the law.And I want
every farmer to consider every man who labors either with hand or brain
as his brother.Until genius and labor formed a partnership there was
no such thing as prosperity among men.Every reaper and mower, every
agricultural implement, has elevated the work of the farmer, and his
vocation grows grander with every invention.In the olden time the
agriculturist was ignorant; he knew nothing of machinery, he was the
slave of superstition.The Sad Wilderness History

While reading the Pentateuch, I am filled with indignation, pity and
horror.Nothing can be sadder than the history of the starved and
frightened wretches who wandered over the desolate crags and sands of
wilderness and desert, the prey of famine, sword and plague.Ignorant
and superstitious to the last degree, governed by falsehood, plundered
by hypocrisy, they were the sport of priests, and the food of fear.God
was their greatest enemy, and death their only friend.Law Much Older than Sinai

Laws spring from the instinct of self-preservation.Industry objected
to supporting idleness, and laws were made against theft.Laws were made
against murder, because a very large majority of the people have always
objected to being murdered.All fundamental laws were born simply of the
instinct of self-defence.Long before the Jewish savages assembled at
the foot of Sinai, laws had been made and enforced, not only in Egypt
and India, but by every tribe that ever existed.God raised the black flag, and
commanded his soldiers to kill even the smiling infant in its mother's
arms.Who is the blasphemer; the man who denies the existence of God, or
he who covers the robes of the infinite with innocent blood?Standing Tip for God

We are told in the Pentateuch that God, the father of us all, gave
thousands of maidens, after having killed their fathers, their mothers,
and their brothers, to satisfy the brutal lusts of savage men.If there
be a God, I pray him to write in his book, opposite my name, that I
denied this lie for him.Matter and Force

The statement in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, I
cannot accept.It is contrary to my reason, and I cannot believe it.It
appears reasonable for me that force has existed from eternity.Force
cannot, as it appears to me, exist apart from matter.Force, in its
nature, is forever active, and without matter it could not act; and so
I think matter must have existed forever.To conceive of matter without
force, or of force without matter, or of a time when neither existed,
or of a being who existed for an eternity without either, and who out of
nothing created both, is to me utterly impossible.It may be that I am led to these conclusions by "total depravity," or
that I lack the necessary humility of spirit to satisfactorily harmonize
Haeckel and Moses; or that I am carried away by pride, blinded by
reason, given over to hardness of heart that I might be damned, but I
never can believe that the earth was covered with leaves, and buds, and
flowers, and fruits, before the sun with glittering spear had driven
back the hosts of night.We are told that God made man; and the question naturally arises, how
was this done?Was it by a process of "evolution," "development;" the
"transmission of acquired habits;" the "survival of the fittest," or was
the necessary amount of clay kneaded to the proper consistency, and then
by the hands of God moulded into form?Modern science tells that man has
been evolved, through countless epochs, from the lower forms; that he
is the result of almost an infinite number of actions, reactions,
experiences, states, forms, wants and adaptations.General Joshua

My own opinion is that General Joshua knew no more about the motions of
the earth than he did mercy and justice.If he had known that the earth
turned upon its axis at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, and swept
in its course about the sun at the rate of sixty-eight thousand miles
an hour, he would have doubled the hailstones, spoken of in the same
chapter, that the Lord cast down from heaven, and allowed the sun and
moon to rise and set in the usual way.This getting up so early in the morning is a relic of barbarism.It has
made hundreds of thousands of young men curse business.There is no need
of getting up at three or four o'clock in the winter morning.The farmer
who persists in dragging his wife and children from their beds ought to
be visited by a missionary.It is time enough to rise after the sun has
set the example.Why
not feed them more the night before?In the old
times they used to get up about three o'clock in the morning, and go to
work long before the sun had risen with "healing upon his wings," and as
a just punishment they all had the ague; and they ought to have it now.Sleep is the best medicine
in the world.There is no such thing as health, without plenty of sleep.When you work, work;
and when you get through take a good, long and refreshing sleep.Never Rise at Four O'Clock

The man who cannot get a living upon Illinois soil without rising before
daylight ought to starve.Eight hours a day is enough for any farmer to
work except in harvest time.When you rise at four and work till dark
what is life worth?Of what use are all the improvements in farming?Of what use is all the improved machinery unless it tends to give the
farmer a little more leisure?What is harvesting now, compared with what
it was in the old time?Think of the days of reaping, of cradling, of
raking and binding and mowing.Think of threshing with the flail and
winnowing with the wind.And now think of the reapers and mowers, the
binders and threshing machines, the plows and cultivators, upon which
the farmer rides protected from the sun.If, with all these advantages,
you cannot get a living without rising in the middle of the night, go
into some other business.The Hermit is Mad

A hermit is a mad man.Without friends and wife and child, there is
nothing left worth living for.They
are filled with egotism and envy, with vanity and hatred.People who
live much alone become narrow and suspicious.They are apt to be the
property of one idea.They begin to think there is no use in anything.They look upon the happiness of others as a kind of folly.They hate
joyous folks, because, way down in their hearts, they envy them.Duke Orang-Outang

I think we came from the lower animals.I am not dead sure of it, but
think so.When I first read about it I didn't like it.My heart was
filled with sympathy for those people who leave nothing to be proud of
except ancestors.I thought how terrible this will be upon the nobility
of the old world.Think of their being forced to trace their ancestry
back to the Duke Orang-Outang or to the Princess Chimpanzee.After
thinking it all over I came to the conclusion that I liked that
doctrine.I read about
rudimentary bones and muscles.I was told that everybody had rudimentary
muscles extending from the ear into the cheek.I was told: "They are the remains of muscles; they became rudimentary
from the lack of use."They are the muscles
with which your ancestors used to flap their ears.Well, at first I was
greatly astonished, and afterward I was more astonished to find they had
become rudimentary.Self-Made Men

It is often said of this or that man that he is a self-made man--that
he was born of the poorest and humblest parents, and that with every
obstacle to overcome he became great.Most of the intellectual giants of the world
have been nursed at the sad but loving breast of poverty.Most of those
who have climbed highest on the shining ladder of fame commenced at the
lowest round.They were reared in the straw thatched cottages of Europe;
in the log houses of America; in the factories of the great cities; in
the midst of toil; in the smoke and din of labor.The One Window in the Ark

A cubit is twenty-two inches; so that the ark was five hundred and fifty
feet long, ninety-one feet and eight inches wide, and fifty-five feet
high.The ark was divided into three stories, and had on top, one window
twenty-two inches square.Ventillation must have been one of Jehovah's
hobbies.Think of a ship larger than the Great Eastern with only one
window, and that but twenty-two inches square!No Ante-Diluvian Camp-Meetings!It is a little curious that when God wished to reform the ante-diluvian
world he said nothing about hell; that he had no revivals, no
camp-meetings, no tracts, no out-pourings of the Holy Ghost, no
baptisms, no noon prayer meetings, and never mentioned the great
doctrine of salvation by faith.If the orthodox creeds of the world are
true, all those people went to hell without ever having heard that such
a place existed.If eternal torment is a fact, surely these miserable
wretches ought to have been warned.They were threatened only with water
when they were in fact doomed to eternal fire!Hard Work in the Ark

Eight persons did all the work.They attended to the wants of 175,000
birds, 3,616 beasts, 1,300 reptiles, and 2,000,000 insects, saying
nothing of countless animalculae.Can we believe that the inspired writer had any idea of the size of the
sun?Draw a circle five inches in diameter, and by its side thrust a pin
through the paper.The hole made by the pin will sustain about the same
relation to the circle that the earth does to the sun.Did he know that
the sun was eight hundred and sixty thousand miles in diameter; that it
was enveloped in an ocean of fire thousands of miles in depth, hotter
even than the Christian's hell?Did he know that the volume of the Earth
is less than one-millionth of that of the sun?Did he know of the one
hundred and four planets belonging to our solar system, all children of
the sun?Did he know of Jupiter eighty-five thousand miles in diameter,
hundreds of times as large as our earth, turning on his axis at the rate
of twenty-five thousand miles an hour accompanied by four moons making
the tour of his orbit once only in fifty years?Something for Nothing

It is impossible for me to conceive of something being created for
nothing.Nothing, regarded in the light of raw material, is a decided
failure.Neither is it
possible to think of force disconnected with matter.You cannot imagine
matter going back to absolute nothing.Neither can you imagine nothing
being changed into something.You may be eternally damned if you do not
say that you can conceive these things, but you cannot conceive them.Polygamy

Polygamy is just as pure in Utah as it could have been in the promised
land.Love and virtue are the same the whole world around, and justice
is the same in every star.All the languages of the world are not
sufficient to express the filth of polygamy.It makes of man a beast,
of woman a trembling slave.It destroys the fireside, makes virtue an
outcast, takes from human speech its sweetest words, and leaves the
heart a den, where crawl and hiss the slimy serpents of most loathsome
lust.The good family is the unit
of good government.The virtues grow about the holy hearth of home--they
cluster, bloom, and shed their perfume round the fireside where the
one man loves the one woman.Lover--husband--wife--mother--father--child--home!--without these sacred
words the world is but a lair, and men and women merely beasts.The Colonel in the Kitchen--How to Cook a Beefsteak

There ought to be a law making it a crime, punishable by imprisonment,
to fry a beefsteak.Broil it; it is just as easy, and when broiled it
is delicious.Fried beefsteak is not fit for a wild beast.You can broil
even on a stove.Shut the front damper--open the back one, and then take
off a griddle.There will then be a draft down through this opening.Put
on your steak, using a wire broiler, and not a particle of smoke will
touch it, for the reason that the smoke goes down.If you try to broil
it with the front damper open the smoke will rise.For broiling, coal,
even soft coal, makes a better fire than wood.Do not huddle together in a little room
around a red-hot stove, with every window fastened down.Do not live in
this poisoned atmosphere, and then, when one of your children dies, put
a piece in the papers commencing with, "Whereas, it has pleased divine
Providence to remove from our midst--."Have plenty of air, and plenty
of warmth.Do not imagine anything is unhealthy
simply because it is pleasant.Cooking a Fine Art

Cooking is one of the fine arts.Give your wives and daughters things to
cook, and things to cook with, and they will soon become most excellent
cooks.The man whose arteries
and veins are filled with rich blood made of good and well cooked food,
has pluck, courage, endurance and noble impulses.Remember that your
wife should have things to cook with.Scathing Impeachment of Intemperance

Intemperance cuts down youth in its vigor, manhood in its strength, and
age in its weakness.It breaks the father's heart, bereaves the doting
mother, extinguishes natural affections, erases conjugal loves, blots
out filial attachments, blights parental hope, and brings down mourning
age in sorrow to the grave.It produces weakness, not strength;
sickness, not health; death, not life.It makes wives widows; children
orphans; fathers fiends, and all of them paupers and beggars.It feeds
rheumatism, nurses gout, welcomes epidemics, invites cholera, imports
pestilence and embraces consumption.It covers the land with idleness,
misery and crime.It fills your jails, supplies your almshouses and
demands your asylums.It engenders controversies, fosters quarrels, and
cherishes riots.It crowds your penitentiaries and furnishes victims to
your scaffolds.It is the life blood of the gambler, the element of
the burglar, the prop of the highwayman and the support of the midnight
incendiary.It countenances the liar, respects the thief, esteems
the blasphemer.It violates obligations, reverences fraud, and honors
infamy.It defames benevolence, hates love, scorns virtue and slanders
innocence.It incites the father to butcher his helpless offspring,
helps the husband to massacre his wife, and the child to grind the
parricidal ax.It burns up men, consumes women, detests life, curses God,
and despises heaven.It suborns witnesses, nurses perjury, defiles
the jury box, and stains the judicial ermine.It degrades the citizen,
debases the legislator, dishonors statesmen, and disarms the patriot.It
brings shame, not honor; terror, not safety; despair, not hope; misery,
not happiness; and with the malevolence of a fiend, it calmly surveys
its frightful desolation, and unsatisfied with its havoc, it poisons
felicity, kills peace, ruins morals, blights confidence, slays
reputation, and wipes out national honors, then curses the world and
laughs at its ruin.Liberty Defined

The French convention gave the best definition of liberty I have ever
read: "The liberty of one citizen ceases only where the liberty of
another citizen commences."I ask you
to-day to make a declaration of individual independence.And if you are
independent, be just.Allow everybody else to make his declaration of
individual independence.Allow your wife, allow your husband, allow
your children to make theirs.It is a grand thing to be the owner of
yourself.It is a grand thing to protect the rights of others.It is a
sublime thing to be free and just.Free, Honest Thought

I am going to say what little I can to make the American people brave
enough and generous enough and kind enough to give everybody else the
rights they have themselves.Can there ever be any progress in this
world to amount to anything until we have liberty?The thoughts of a man
who is not free are not worth much--not much.A man who thinks with the
club of a creed above his head--a man who thinks casting his eye askance
at the flames of hell, is not apt to have very good thoughts.And for
my part, I would not care to have any status or social position even in
heaven if I had to admit that I never would have been there only I got
scared.When we are frightened we do not think very well.If you want to
get at the honest thoughts of a man he must free.If he is not free you
will not get his honest thought.Ingersoll Prefers Shoemakers to Princes

The other day there came shoemakers, potters, workers in wood and iron,
from Europe, and they were received in the city of New York as though
they had been princes.They had been sent by the great republic of
France to examine into the arts and manufactures of the great republic
of America.They looked a thousand times better to me than the Edward
Alberts and Albert Edwards--the royal vermin, that live on the body
politic.And I would think much more of our government if it would fete
and feast them, instead of wining and dining the imbeciles of a royal
line.I never saw a dignified man that was not after all an
old idiot Dignity is a mask; a dignified man is afraid that you will
know he does not know everything.A man of sense and argument is always
willing to admit what he don't know--why?--because there is so much
that he does know; and that is the first step towards learning
anything--willingness to admit what you don't know, and when you don't
understand a thing, ask--no matter how small and silly it may look to
other people--ask, and after that you know.A man never is in a state of
mind that he can learn until he gets that dignified nonsense out of him.The time is coming when a man will be rated at his real worth, and that
by his brain and heart.We care nothing now about an officer unless he
fills his place.The time will come when no matter how much money a man
has he will not be respected unless he is using it for the benefit of
his fellow-men.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen
States to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the
conveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes
two hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves
his friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the
obligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest
sympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for
himself, is the true nobleman.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of
the air and have given one country to mankind.Wanted!--More Manliness

I had a thousand times rather have a farm and be independent, than to be
President of the United States, without independence, filled with
doubt and trembling, feeling of the popular pulse, resorting to art and
artifice, inquiring about the wind of opinion, and succeeding at last in
losing my self-respect without gaining the respect of others.Man needs
more manliness, more real independence.This we can do by labor, and in this way we can preserve our
independence.We should try and choose that business or profession the
pursuit of which will give us the most happiness.We can be happy without being rich--without holding office--without
being famous.I am not sure that we can be happy with wealth, with
office, or with fame.Education of Nature

It has been a favorite idea with me that our forefathers were educated
by nature; that they grew grand as the continent upon which they landed;
that the great rivers--the wide plains--the splendid lakes--the lonely
forests--the sublime mountains--that all these things stole into and
became a part of their being, and they grew great as the country in
which they lived.They began to hate the narrow, contracted views of
Europe.The Worker Wearing the Purple

I want to see a workingman have a good house, painted white, grass in
the front yard, carpets on the floor and pictures on the wall.I want to
see him a man feeling that he is a king by the divine right of living in
the Republic.And every man here is just a little bit a king, you know.Every man here is a part of the sovereign power.Every man wears a
little of purple; every man has a little of crown and a little of
sceptre; and every man that will sell his vote for money or be ruled by
prejudice is unfit to be an American citizen.Flowers

Beautify your grounds with plants and flowers and vines.Remember that everything of beauty tends to the elevation of
man.Every little morning-glory whose purple bosom is thrilled with the
amorous kisses of the sun tends to put a blossom in your heart.Do not
judge of the value of everything by the market reports.Every flower
about a house certifies to the refinement of somebody.Every vine,
climbing and blossoming, tells of love and joy.The grave is not a throne, and a corpse is not a king.The living have
a right to control this world.I think a good deal more of to day than
I do of yesterday, and I think more of to-morrow than I do of this day;
because it is nearly gone--that is the way I feel.The time to be happy
is now; the way to be happy is to make somebody else happy and the place
to be happy is here.The School House a Fort

Education is the most radical thing in the world.To teach the alphabet is to inaugurate a revolution.To build a school
house is to construct a fort.We are Getting Free

We are getting free.We are
investigating with the microscope and the telescope.We are digging
into the earth and finding souvenirs of all the ages.We are finding out
something about the laws of health and disease.We are adding years to
the span of human life and we are making the world fit to live in.That is what we are doing, and every man that has an honest thought and
expresses it helps, and every man that tries to keep honest thought from
being expressed is an obstruction and a hindrance.The Solid Rock

I have made up my mind that if there is a God He will be merciful to the
merciful.That He will forgive the forgiving;
upon that rock I stand.That every man should be true to himself, and
that there is no world, no star, in which honesty is a crime; and upon
that rock I stand.An honest man, a good, kind, sweet woman, or a happy
child, has nothing to fear, neither in this world nor the world to come;
and upon that rock I stand.INGERSOLL'S FIVE GOSPELS




408.The Gospel of Cheerfulness

I believe in the gospel of cheerfulness; the gospel of good nature; in
the gospel of good health.Let us pay some attention to our bodies; take
care of our bodies, and our souls will take care of themselves.I believe the time will come when the public thought will be so
great and grand that it will be looked upon as infamous to perpetuate
disease.I believe the time will come when men will not fill the future
with consumption and with insanity.I believe the time will come when
with studying ourselves and understanding the laws of health, we will
say we are under obligations to put the flags of health in the cheeks of
our children.Even if I got to Heaven, and had a harp, I would hate to
look back upon my children and see them diseased, deformed, crazed, all
suffering the penalty of crimes that I had committed.The Gospel of Liberty

And I believe, too, in the gospel of liberty,---of giving to others what
we claim.And I believe there is room everywhere for thought, and
the more liberty you give away the more you will have.In liberty
extravagance is economy.Let us be just, let us be generous to each
other.The Gospel of 'Good Living

I believe in the gospel of good living.You cannot make any God happy by
fasting.Let us have good food, and let us have it well cooked; it is
a thousand times better to know how to cook it than it is to understand
any theology in the world.I
believe in the gospel of good houses; in the gospel of water and soap.The Gospel of Intelligence

I believe in the gospel of intelligence.That is the only lever capable
of raising mankind.I believe in the gospel of intelligence; in the
gospel of education.The school-house is my cathedral; the universe
is my Bible.And no God can put a man into hell in another world who has
made a little heaven in this.God cannot make miserable a man who has
made somebody else happy.God can not hate anybody who is capable of
loving his neighbor.So I believe in this great gospel of generosity.Ah, but they say it won't do.My gospel
of health will prolong life; my gospel of intelligence, my gospel of
loving, my gospel of good-fellowship will cover the world with happy
homes.My doctrine will put carpets upon your floors, pictures upon your
walls.My doctrine will put books upon your shelves, ideas in your mind.My doctrine will relieve the world of the abnormal monsters born of the
ignorance of superstition.My doctrine will give us health, wealth, and
happiness.The Gospel of Justice

I believe in the gospel of justice,--that we must reap what we sow.Smith, and God forgive me,
how does that help Smith?If I by slander cover some poor girl with
the leprosy of some imputed crime, and she withers away like a blighted
flower, and afterwards I get forgiveness, how does that help her?If
there is another world, we have got to settle; no bankruptcy court
there.Among the ancient Jews if you committed a crime you
had to kill a sheep; now they say, "Charge it.For every crime you commit you must answer to yourself and
to the one you injure.And if you have ever clothed another with
unhappiness as with a garment cf pain, you will never be quite as
happy as though you hadn't done that thing.No forgiveness, eternal,
inexorable, everlasting justice--that is what I believe in.And if it goes hard with me, I will stand it.And I will stick to my
logic, and I will bear it like a man.GEMS FROM THE CONTROVERSIAL GASKET

     Latest Utterances of Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll,
     in a Controversy with Judge Jere 8.Black,
     on "The Christian Religion"




413.The Origin of the Controversy

Several months ago, _The North American Review_ asked me to write an
article, saying that it would be published if some one would furnish a
reply.I wrote the article that appeared in the August number, and by
me it was entitled "Is All of the Bible Inspired?"Not until the
article was written did I know who was expected to answer.I make this
explanation for the purpose of dissipating the impression that Mr.To have struck his shield with my lance might
have given birth to the impression that I was somewhat doubtful as to
the correctness of my position.I naturally expected an answer from some
professional theologian, and was surprised to find that a reply had been
written by a "policeman," who imagined that he had answered my arguments
by simply telling me that my statements were false.It is somewhat
unfortunate that in a discussion like this any one should resort to the
slightest personal detraction.The theme is great enough to engage the
highest faculties of the human mind, and in the investigation of such a
subject vituperation is singularly and vulgarly out of place.Arguments
cannot be answered with insults.It is unfortunate that the intellectual
arena should be entered by a "policeman," who has more confidence in
concussion than discussion.Good nature is often
mistaken for virtue, and good health sometimes passes for genius.Anger blows out the lamp of the mind.In the examination of a great and
important question, every one should be serene, slow-pulsed, and calm.Black's reply, feeling that so
grand a subject should not be blown and tainted with malicious words, I
proceed to answer as best I may the arguments he has urged.Of course it is still claimed that we are a Christian people, indebted
to something we call Christianity, for all the progress we have made.There is still a vast difference of opinion as to what Christianity
really is, although many wavering sects have been discussing that
question, with fire and sword through centuries of creed and crime.Every new sect has been denounced at its birth as illegitimate, as
something born out of orthodox wedlock, and that should have been
allowed to perish on the steps where it was found.Summary of Evangelical Belief

Among the evangelical churches there is a substantial agreement
upon what they consider the fundamental truths of the gospel.These
fundamental truths, as I understand them, are:--That there is a personal
God, the creator of the material universe; that he made man of the dust,
and woman from part of the man; that the man and woman were tempted by
the devil; that they were turned out of the garden of Eden; that, about
fifteen hundred years afterward, God's patience having been exhausted by
the wickedness of mankind, He drowned His children, with the exception
of eight persons; that afterward He selected from their descendants
Abraham, and through him the Jewish people; that He gave laws to these
people, and tried to govern them in all things; that He made known His
will in many ways; that He wrought a vast number of miracles; that
He inspired men to write the Bible; that, in the fullness of time, it
having been found impossible to reform mankind, this God came upon earth
as a child born of the Virgin Mary; that He lived in Palestine; that He
preached for about three years, going from place to place, occasionally
raising the dead, curing the blind and the halt; that He was
crucified--for the crime of blasphemy, as the Jews supposed, but, that
as a matter of fact, He was offered as a sacrifice for the sins of
all who might have faith in Him; that He was raised from the dead and
ascended into heaven, where He now is, making intercession for His
followers; that He will forgive the sins of all who believe on Him,
and that those who do not believe will be consigned to the dungeons of
eternal pain.These--(it may be with the addition of the sacraments of
Baptism and the Last Supper)--constitute what is generally known as the
Christian religion.A Profound Change in the World of Thought

A profound change has taken place in the world of thought.The pews are
trying to set themselves somewhat above the pulpit.The layman discusses
theology with the minister, and smiles.Christians excuse themselves
for belonging to the church by denying a part of the creed.The idea
is abroad that they who know the most of nature believe the least about
theology.The sciences are regarded as infidels, and facts as scoffers.Thousands of most excellent people avoid churches, and, with few
exceptions, only those attend prayer meetings who wish to be alone.The
pulpit is losing because the people are rising.The Believer in the Inspiration of the Bible has too Much to Believe

But the believer in the inspiration of the Bible is compelled to declare
that there was a time when slavery was right--when men could buy and
women sell their babes.He is compelled to insist that there was a time
when polygamy was the highest form of virtue; when wars of extermination
were waged with the sword of mercy; when religious toleration was a
crime, and when death was the just penalty for having expressed an
honest thought.He must maintain that Jehovah is just as bad now as he
was four thousand years ago, or that he was just as good then as he is
now, but that human conditions have so changed that slavery, polygamy,
religious persecutions and wars of conquest are now perfectly devilish.Once they were right--once they were commanded by God himself; now, they
are prohibited.There has been such a change in the conditions of man
that, at the present time, the devil is in favor of slavery, polygamy,
religious persecution and wars of conquest.That is to say, the devil
entertains the same opinion to-day that Jehovah held four thousand
years ago, but in the meantime Jehovah has remained exactly the
same--changeless and incapable of change.A Frank Admission

It is most cheerfully admitted that a vast number of people not only
believe these things, but hold them in exceeding reverence, and imagine
them to be of the utmost importance to mankind.They regard the Bible as
the only light that God has given for the guidance of His children; that
it is the one star in nature's sky--the foundation of all morality, of
all law, of all order, and of all individual and national progress.They
regard it as the only means we have for ascertaining the will of God,
the origin of man, and the destiny of the soul.The mistake has hindered in countless ways the civilization of
man.The Bible Should be Better than any other Book

In all ages of which any record has been preserved, there have been
those who gave their ideas of justice, charity, liberty, love, and
law.Now, if the Bible is really the work of God, it should contain the
grandest and sublimest truths.It should, in all respects, excel the
works of man.Within that book should be found the best and loftiest
definitions of justice; the truest conceptions of human liberty; the
clearest outlines of duty; the tenderest, the highest, and the noblest
thoughts,--not that the human mind has produced, but that the human mind
is capable of receiving.Upon every page should be found the luminous
evidence of its divine origin.Unless it contains grander and more
wonderful things than man has written, we are not only justified in
saying, but we are compelled to say, that it was written by no being
superior to man.A Serious Charge

The Bible has been the fortress and the defense of nearly every crime.No civilized country could re-enact its laws.And in many respects its
moral code is abhorrent to every good and tender man.It is admitted,
however, that many of its precepts are pure, that many of its laws are
wise and just, and that many of its statements are absolutely true.If the Bible is Not Verbally Inspired, What Then?It may be said that it is unfair to call attention to certain bad things
in the Bible, while the good are not so much as mentioned.To this it
may be replied that a divine being would not put bad things in a book.Certainly a being of infinite intelligence, power, and goodness could
never fall below the ideal of "depraved and barbarous" man.It will not
do, after we find that the Bible upholds what we now call crimes, to say
that it is not verbally inspired.If the words are not inspired, what
is?It may be said that the thoughts are inspired.But this would
include only the thoughts expressed without words.If the ideas are
inspired, they must be contained in and expressed only by inspired
words; that is to say, the arrangement of the words, with relation to
each other, must have been inspired.A Hindu Example

Suppose that we should now discover a Hindu book of equal antiquity with
the Old Testament, containing a defense of slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution, would we regard it as evidence
that the writers were inspired by an infinitely wise and merciful God?A Test Fairly Applied

Suppose we knew that after "inspired" men had finished the Bible, the
devil had got possession of it and wrote a few passages, what part of
the sacred Scriptures would Christians now pick out as being probably
his work?Which of the following passages would naturally be selected
as having been written by the devil--"Love thy neighbor as thyself," or
"Kill all the males among the little ones, and kill every woman; but all
the women children keep alive for yourselves?"It will hardly be claimed at this day, that the passages in the
Bible upholding slavery, polygamy, war, and religious persecution are
evidences of the inspiration of that book.Suppose that there had been
nothing in the Old Testament upholding these crimes would any modern
Christian suspect that it was not inspired on account of that omission?Suppose that there had been nothing in the Old Testament but laws in
favor of these crimes, would any intelligent Christian now contend that
it was the work of the true God?Proofs of Civilization

We know that there was a time in the history of almost every nation when
slavery, polygamy, and wars of extermination were regarded as divine
institutions; when women were looked upon as beasts of burden, and when,
among some people, it was considered the duty of the husband to murder
the wife for differing with him on the subject of religion.Nations that
entertain these views to-day are regarded as savage, and, probably, with
the exception of the South Sea islanders, the Feejees, some citizens
of Delaware, and a few tribes in Central Africa, no human beings can be
found degraded enough to agree upon these subjects with the Jehovah of
the ancient Jews.The only evidence we have, or can have, that a
nation has ceased to be savage is the fact that it has abandoned these
doctrines.To every one, except the theologian, it is perfectly easy to
account for the mistakes, atrocities, and crimes of the past, by
saying that civilization is a slow and painful growth; that the moral
perceptions are cultivated through ages of tyranny, of want, of crime,
and of heroism; that it requires centuries for man to put out the eyes
of self and hold in lofty and in equal poise the scales of justice;
that conscience is born of suffering; that mercy is the child of the
imagination--of the power to put oneself in the sufferers place, and
that man advances only as he becomes acquainted with his surroundings,
with the mutual obligations of life, and learns to take advantage of the
forces of nature.A Persian Gospel

Do not misunderstand me.My position is that the cruel passages in
the Old Testament are not inspired; that slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution always have been, are, and
forever will be, abhorred and cursed by the honest, virtuous, and the
loving; that the innocent cannot justly suffer for the guilty, and that
vicarious vice and vicarious virtue are equally absurd; that eternal
punishment is eternal revenge; that only the natural can happen; that
miracles prove the dishonesty of the few and the credulity of the many;
and that, according to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, salvation does not
depend upon belief, nor the atonement, nor a "second birth," but that
these gospels are in exact harmony with the declaration of the great
Persian: "Taking the first footstep with the good thought, the second
with the good word, and the third with the good deed, I entered
paradise."The dogmas of the past no longer reach the level of the
highest thought, nor satisfy the hunger of the heart.While dusty
faiths, embalmed and sepulchered in ancient texts, remain the same,
the sympathies of men enlarge; the brain no longer kills its young; the
happy lips give liberty to honest thoughts; the mental firmament expands
and lifts; the broken clouds drift by; the hideous dreams, the foul,
misshapen children of the monstrous night, dissolve and fade.Man the Author of all Books

So far as we know, man is the author of all books.If a book had been
found on the earth by the first man, he might have regarded it as the
work of God; but as men were here a good while before any books were
found, and as man has produced a great many books, the probability is
that the Bible is no exception.God and Brahma

Can we believe that God ever said of any: "Let his children be
fatherless and his wife a widow; let his children be continually
vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also out of their desolate
places; let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the stranger
spoil his labor, let there be none to extend mercy unto him, neither let
there be any to favor his fatherless children."If he ever said these
words, surely he had never heard this line, this strain of music, from
the Hindu: "Sweet is the lute to those who have not heard the prattle of
their own children."Jehovah, "from the clouds and darkness of Sinai,"
said to the Jews: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me.... Thou
shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."Contrast this with the words put by the Hindu in the mouth of Brahma:
"I am the same to all mankind.They who honestly serve other gods,
involuntarily worship me.I am he who partaketh of all worship, and I
am the reward of all worshipers."The first, a
dungeon where crawl the things begot of jealous slime; the other, great
as the domed firmament inlaid with suns.Matthew, Mark, and Luke

And I here take occasion to say, that with most of the teachings of the
gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke I most heartily agree.The miraculous
parts must, of course, be thrown aside.I admit that the necessity of
belief, the atonement, and the scheme of salvation are all set forth
in the Gospel of John,--a gospel, in my opinion, not written until long
after the others.Christianity Takes no Step in Advance

All the languages of the world have not words of horror enough to
paint the agonies of man when the church had power.Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, Nero, Domitian, and Commodus were not as cruel, false,
and base as many of the Christian Popes.Opposite the names of these
imperial criminals write John the XII., Leo the VIII., Boniface the VII.,
Benedict the IX., Innocent the III., and Alexander the VI.Was it under
these pontiffs that the "church penetrated the moral darkness like a
new sun," and covered the globe with institutions of mercy?Rome was far
better when Pagan than when Catholic.It was better to allow gladiators
and criminals to fight than to burn honest men.The greatest of Romans
denounced the cruelties of the arena.Seneca condemned the combats even
of wild beasts.He was tender enough to say that "we should have a bond
of sympathy for all sentiment beings, knowing that only the depraved
and base take pleasure in the sight of blood and suffering."Aurelius
compelled the gladiators to fight with blunted swords.Roman lawyers
declared that all men are by nature free and equal.Woman, under Pagan
rule in Rome, become as free as man.Zeno, long before the birth of
Christ, taught that virtue alone establishes a difference between men.We know that the Civil Law is the foundation of our codes.We know that
fragments of Greek and Roman art--a few manuscripts saved from Christian
destruction, some inventions and discoveries of the Moors--were the
seeds of modern civilization.Christianity, for a thousand years,
taught memory to forget and reason to believe.Not one step was taken in
advance.Over the manuscripts of philosophers and poets, priests, with
their ignorant tongues thrust out, devoutly scrawled the forgeries of
faith.Christianity a Mixture of Good and Evil

Mr.Black attributes to me the following expression: "Christianity is
pernicious in its moral effect, darkens the mind, narrows the soul,
arrests the progress of human society, and hinders civilization."Strange, that he is only able to answer what I did
not say.I endeavored to show that the passages in the Old Testament
upholding slavery, polygamy, wars of extermination, and religious
intolerance had filled the world with blood and crime.I admitted
that there are many wise and good things in the Old Testament.I also
insisted that the doctrine of the atonement--that is to say, of moral
bankruptcy--the idea that a certain belief is necessary to salvation,
and the frightful dogma of eternal pain, had narrowed the soul, had
darkened the mind, and had arrested the progress of human society.Like
other religions, Christianity is a mixture of good and evil.The church
has made more orphans than it has fed.It has never built asylums enough
to hold the insane of its own making.Jehovah, Epictetus and Cicero

If the Bible is really inspired, Jehovah commanded the Jewish people to
buy the children of the strangers that sojourned among them, and ordered
that the children thus bought should be an inheritance for the children
of the Jews, and that they should be bondmen and bondwomen forever.Yet
Epictetus, a man to whom no revelation was ever made, a man whose soul
followed only the light of nature, and who had never heard of the Jewish
God, was great enough to say: "Will you not remember that your servants
are by nature your brothers, the children of God?In saying that you
have bought them, you look down on the earth and into the pit, on the
wretched law of men long since dead,--but you see not the laws of the
Gods."We find that Jehovah, speaking to his chosen people, assured them
that their bondmen and bondmaids must be "of the heathen that were
round about them.""Of them," said Jehovah, "shall ye buy bondmen
and bondmaids."And yet Cicero, a pagan, Cicero, who had never been
enlightened by reading the Old Testament, had the moral grandeur to
declare: "They who say that we should love our fellow-citizens, but not
foreigners, destroy the universal brotherhood of mankind, with which
benevolence and justice would perish forever."The Atonement

In countless ways the Christian world has endeavored, for nearly two
thousand years, to explain the atonement, and every effort has ended in
an an mission that it cannot be understood, and a declaration that it
must be believed.Is it not immoral to teach that man can sin, that he
can harden his heart and pollute his soul, and that, by repenting
and believing something that he does not comprehend, he can avoid the
consequences of his crimes?Has the promise and hope of forgiveness ever
prevented the commission of a sin?Should men be taught that sin gives
happiness here; that they ought to bear the evils of a virtuous life in
this world for the sake of joy in the next; that they can repent between
the last sin and the last breath; that after repentance every stain
of the soul is washed away by the innocent blood of another; that the
serpent of regret will not hiss in the ear of memory; that the saved
will not even pity the victims of their own crimes; that the goodness
of another can be transferred to them; and that sins forgiven cease to
affect the unhappy wretches sinned against?Sin as a Debt

The Church says that the sinner is in debt to God, and that the
obligation is discharged by the Saviour.The best that can possibly be
said of such a transaction is, that the debt is transferred, not paid.The truth is, that a sinner is in debt to the person he has injured.If a man injures his neighbor, it is not enough for him to get the
forgiveness of God, but he must have the forgiveness of his neighbor.If a man puts his hand in the fire and God forgives him, his hand will
smart exactly the same.You must, after all, reap what you sow.No god
can give you wheat when you sow tares, and no devil can give you tares
when you sow wheat.The Logic of the Coffin

As to the doctrine of the atonement, Mr.Black has nothing to offer
except the barren statement that it is believed by the wisest and the
best.A Mohammedan, speaking in Constantinople, will say the same of the
Koran.A Brahman, in a Hindu temple, will make the same remark, and so
will the American Indian, when he endeavors to enforce something upon
the young of his tribe.He will say: "The best, the greatest of our
tribe have believed in this."This is the argument of the cemetery, the
philosophy of epitaphs, the logic of the coffin.We are the greatest and
wisest and most virtuous of mankind?This statement, that it has been
believed by the best, is made in connection with an admission that it
cannot be fathomed by the wisest.It is not claimed that a thing is
necessarily false because it is not understood, but I do claim that
it is not necessarily true because it cannot be comprehended.I still
insist that "the plan of redemption," as usually preached, is absurd,
unjust, and immoral.Judas Iscariot

For nearly two thousand years Judas Iscariot has been execrated by
mankind; and yet, if the doctrine of the atonement is true, upon his
treachery hung the plan of salvation.Suppose Judas had known of this
plan--known that he was selected by Christ for that very purpose, that
Christ was depending on him.And suppose that he also knew that only
by betraying Christ could he save either himself or others; what ought
Judas to have done?Are you willing to rely upon an argument that
justifies the treachery of that wretch?The Standard of Right

According to Mr.Black, the man who does not believe in a supreme being
acknowledges no standard of right and wrong in this world, and therefore
can have no theory of rewards and punishments in the next.Is it
possible that only those who believe in the God who persecuted for
opinion's sake have any standard of right and wrong?Were the greatest
men of all antiquity without this standard?In the eyes of intelligent
men of Greece and Rome, were all deeds, whether good or evil, morally
alike?Is it necessary to believe in the existence of an infinite
intelligence before you can have any standard of right and wrong?Is it
possible that a being cannot be just or virtuous unless he believes in
some being infinitely superior to himself?If this doctrine be true, how
can God be just or virtuous?Does He believe in some being superior to
himself?If man were incapable of suffering, if man could not
feel pain, the word "conscience" never would have passed his lips.The
man who puts himself in the place of another, whose imagination has been
cultivated to the point of feeling the agonies suffered by another, is
the man of conscience.Black says, "We have neither jurisdiction or capacity to rejudge
the justice of God."In other words, we have no right to think upon
this subject, no right to examine the questions most vitally affecting
human-kind.We are simply to accept the ignorant statements of barbarian
dead.This question cannot be settled by saying that "it would be a
mere waste of time and space to enumerate the proofs which show that the
universe was created by a pre-existent and self-conscious being."The
time and space should have been "wasted," and the proofs should have
been enumerated.These "proofs" are what the wisest and greatest are
trying to find.It cares nothing
for the opinions of the "great," nothing for the prejudices of the many,
and least of all, for the superstitions of the dead.In the world of
science--a fact is a legal tender.Assertions and miracles are base and
spurious coins.We have the right to rejudge the justice even of a god.No one should throw away his reason--the fruit of all experience.It is
the intellectual capital of the soul, the only light, the only guide,
and without it the brain becomes the palace of an idiot king, attended
by a retinue of thieves and hypocrites.The Liberty of the Bible

This is the religious liberty of the Bible.If you had lived in
Palestine, and if the wife of your bosom, dearer to you than your
own soul, had said: "I like the religion of India better than that of
Palestine," it would have been your duty to kill her."Your eye must not
pity her, your hand must be first upon her, and afterwards the hand of
all the people."If she had said: "Let us worship the sun--the sun that
clothes the earth in garments of green--the sun, the great fireside of
the world--the sun that covers the hills and valleys with flowers--that
gave me your face, and made it possible for me to look into the eyes
of my babe,--let us worship the sun," it was your duty to kill her.You
must throw the first stone, and when against her bosom--a bosom filled
with love for you--you had thrown the jagged and cruel rock, and had
seen the red stream of her life oozing from the dumb lips of death,
you could then look up and receive the congratulations of the God whose
commandment you had obeyed.Is it possible that a being of infinite
mercy ordered a husband to kill his wife for the crime of having
expressed, an opinion on the subject of religion?Has there been found
upon the records of the savage world anything more perfectly fiendish
than this commandment of Jehovah?This is justified on the ground that
"blasphemy was a breach of political allegiance, and idolatry an act of
overt treason."We can understand how a human king stands in need of the
service of his people.We can understand how the desertion of any of
his soldiers weakens his army; but were the king infinite in power,
his strength would still remain the same, and under no conceivable
circumstances could the enemy triumph.Slavery in Heaven

According to Mr.Black, there will be slavery in Heaven, and fast by
the throne of God will be the auction-block, and the streets of the New
Jerusalem will be adorned with the whipping-post, while the music of
the harp will be supplemented by the crack of the driver's whip.Black, "incorporate him into his family,
tame him, teach him to think, and give him a knowledge of the true
principles of human liberty and government, he would confer upon him a
most beneficent boon."Black is too late with his protest against
the freedom of his fellow-men.Liberty is making the tour of the world.Russia has emancipated her serfs; the slave trade is prosecuted only
by thieves and pirates; Spain feels upon her cheek the burning blush
of shame; Brazil, with proud and happy eyes, is looking for the dawn of
freedom's day; the people of the South rejoice that slavery is no more,
and every good and honest man (excepting Mr.Black) of every land and
clime hopes that the limbs of men will never feel again the weary weight
of chains.Jehovah Breaking His Own Laws

A very curious thing about these Commandments is that their supposed
author violated nearly every one.From Sinai, according to the account,
He said: "Thou shalt not kill," and yet He ordered the murder of
millions; "Thou shalt not commit adultery," and He gave captured maidens
to gratify the lust of captors; "Thou shalt not steal," and yet He gave
to Jewish marauders the flocks and herds of others; "Thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's house, nor his wife," and yet He allowed His chosen
people to destroy the homes of neighbors and to steal their wives;
"Honor thy father and mother," and yet this same God had thousands of
fathers butchered, and with the sword of war killed children yet unborn;
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," and yet
He sent abroad "lying spirits" to deceive His own prophets, and in a
hundred ways paid tribute to deceit.So far as we know, Jehovah kept
only one of these Commandments--He worshiped no other god.I know as little as anyone else about the "pla" of the universe; and as
to the "design," I know just as little.It will not do to say that the
universe was designed, and therefore there must be a designer.There
must first be proof that it was "designed."It will not do to say that
the universe has a "plan," and then assert that there must have been an
infinite maker.The idea that a design must have a beginning, and that a
designer need not, is a simple expression of human ignorance.We find
a watch, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a thing must have had a
maker."We find the watchmaker, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a
thing as man must have had a maker."We find God and we then say: "He is
so wonderful that he must _not_ have had a maker."In other words, all
things a little wonderful must have been created, but it is possible for
something to be so wonderful that it always existed.One would suppose
that just as the wonder increased the necessity for a creator increased,
because it is the wonder of the thing that suggests the idea of
creation.Is it possible that a designer exists from all eternity
without design?Was there no design in having an infinite designer?For
me, it is hard to see the plan or design in earthquakes and pestilences.It is somewhat difficult to discern the design or the benevolence in so
making the world that billions of animals live only on the agonies of
others.The justice of God is not visible to me in the history of this
world.When I think of the suffering and death, of the poverty and
crime, of the cruelty and malice, of the heartlessness of this "design"
and "plan," where beak and claw and tooth tear and rend the quivering
flesh of weakness and despair, I cannot convince myself that it is the
result of infinite wisdom, benevolence, and justice.What we Know of the Infinite

Of course, upon a question like this, nothing can be absolutely known.We live on an atom called Earth, and what we know of the infinite is
almost infinitely limited; but, little as we know, all have an equal
right to give their honest thought.Life is a shadowy, strange,
and winding road on which we travel for a little way--a few short
steps--just from the cradle, with its lullaby of love, to the low and
quiet wayside inn, where all at last must sleep, and where the only
salutation is--Good-night.The Universe Self-Existent

The universe, according to my idea, is, always was, and forever will
be.It did not "come into being;" it is the one eternal being--the only
thing that ever did, does, or can exist.We know nothing of what we call the laws of Nature except as we gather
the idea of law from the uniformity of phenomena springing from like
conditions.To make myself clear: Water always runs down hill.The
theist says that this happens because there is behind the phenomenon an
active law.As a matter of fact law is this side of the phenomenon.Law
does not cause the phenomenon, but the phenomenon causes the idea of law
in our minds, and this idea is produced from the fact that under like
circumstances the same phenomena always happens.Black probably
thinks that the difference in the weight of rocks and clouds was created
by law; that parallel lines fail to imite only because it is illegal;
that diameter and circumference could have been so made that it would
be a greater distance across than around a circle, that a straight line
could inclose a triangle if not prevented by law, and that a little
legislation could make it possible for two bodies to occupy the same
space at the same time.It seems to me that law can not be the cause of
phenomena, but it is an effect produced in our minds by their succession
and resemblance.To put a God back of the universe compels us to admit
that there was a time when nothing existed except this God; that this
God had lived from eternity in an infinite vacuum and in an absolute
idleness.The mind of every thoughtful man is forced to one of these two
conclusions, either that the universe is self-existent or that it
was created by a self-existent being.To my mied there are far more
difficulties in the second hypothesis than in the first.Jehovah's Promise Broken

If Jehovah was in fact God, He knew the end from the beginning.He knew
that his Bible would be a breastwork behind which tyranny and hypocrisy
would crouch; that it would be quoted by tyrants; that it would be the
defense of robbers called kings and of hypocrites called priests.He
knew that He had taught the Jewish people but little of importance.He
knew that He found them free and left them captives.He knew that He
had never fulfilled the promises made to them.He knew that while other
nations had advanced in art and science his chosen people were savage
still.He promised them the world, and gave them a desert.He promised
them liberty, and He made them slaves.He promised them victory, and He
gave them defeat.He said they should be kings, and He made them
serfs.He promised them universal empire, and gave them exile.When one
finishes the Old Testament, he is compelled to say: Nothing can add to
the misery of a nation whose King is Jehovah!Character Bather than Creed

For a thousand years the torch of progress was extinguished in the blood
of Christ, and His disciples, moved by ignorant zeal, by insane, cruel
creeds, destroyed with flame and sword a hundred millions of their
fellow-men.But if cathedrals had been
universities--if dungeons of the Inquisition had been laboratories--if
Christians had believed in character instead of creed--if they had taken
from the Bible all the good and thrown away the wicked and absurd--if
domes of temples had been observatories--if priests had been
philosophers--if missionaries had taught the useful arts--if astrology
had been astronomy--if the black art had been chemistry--if superstition
had been science--if religion had been humanity--it would have been a
heaven filled with love, with liberty, and joy.Mohammed the Prophet of God

Mohammed was a poor man, a driver of camels.He was without education,
without influence, and without wealth, and yet in a few years he
consolidated thousands of tribes, and millions of men confess that there
is "one God, and Mohammed is his prophet."His success was a thousand
times greater during his life than that of Christ.He was not crucified;
he was a conqueror."Of all men, he exercised the greatest influence
upon the human race."Never in the world's history did a religion
spread with the rapidity of his.It burst like a storm over the fairest
portions of the globe.Black is right in his position that
rapidity is secured only by the direct aid of the Divine Being,
then Mohammed was most certainly the prophet of God.As to wars of
extermination and slavery, Mohammed agreed with Mr.Black, and upon
polygamy with Jehovah.As to religious toleration, he was great enough
to say that "men holding to any form of faith might be saved, provided
they were virtuous."In this he was far in advance both of Jehovah and
Mr.Wanted!--A Little More Legislation

We are informed by Mr.Black that "polygamy is neither commanded or
prohibited in the Old Testament--that it is only discouraged."It seems
to me that a little legislation on that subject might have tended to its
"discouragement."Black assures us "consists of certain immutable rules to govern the
conduct of all men at all times and at all places in their private and
personal relations with others," not one word is found on the subject of
polygamy.There is nothing "discouraging" in the Ten Commandments, nor
in the records of any conversation Jehovah is claimed to have had with
Moses upon Sinai.The life of Abraham, the story of Jacob and Laban,
the duty of a brother to be the husband of the widow of his deceased
brother, the life of David, taken in connection with the practice of
one who is claimed to have been the wisest of men--all these things are
probably relied on to show that polygamy was at least "discouraged."Certainly Jehovah had time to instruct Moses as to the infamy of
polygamy.He could have spared a few moments from a description of
patterns of tongs and basins for a subject so important as this.A
few-words in favor of the one wife and one husband--in favor of the
virtuous and loving home--might have taken the place of instructions
as to cutting the garments of priests and fashioning candlesticks and
ounces of gold.If he had left out simply the order that rams' skins
should be dyed red, and in its place had said, "A man shall have but one
wife, and the wife but one husband," how much better it would have been.Again, it is urged that "the acceptance of Christianity by a large
portion of the generation contemporary with its Founder and His
Apostles, was under the circumstances, an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."If this is true,
then "the acceptance of Buddhism by a large portion of the generation
contemporary with its Founder was an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."The same could
be said of Mohammedanism, and, in fact, of every religion that has
ever benefited or cursed this world.This argument, when reduced to its
simplest form, is this: All that succeeds is inspired.The Morality in Christianity

The morality in Christianity has never opposed the freedom of thought.It has never put, nor tended to put, a chain on a human mind, nor a
manacle on a human limb; but the doctrines distinctively Christian--the
necessity of believing a certain thing; the idea that eternal punishment
awaited him who failed to believe; the idea that the innocent can suffer
for the guilty--these things have |opposed, and for a thousand years
substantially destroyed the freedom of the human mind.All religions
have, with ceremony, magic, and mystery, deformed, darkened, and
corrupted, the soul.Around the sturdy oaks of morality have grown and
clung the parasitic, poisonous vines of the miraculous and monstrous.Irenaeus assures us that all Christians possessed the power of
working miracles; that they prophesied, cast out devils, healed the
sick, and even raised the dead.Epiphanius asserts that some rivers
and fountains were annually transmuted into wine, in attestation of the
miracle of Cana, adding that he himself had drunk of these fountains.Augustine declares that one was told in a dream where the bones of
St.Stephen were buried and the bones were thus discovered and brought
to Hippo, and that they raised five dead persons to life, and that in
two years seventy miracles were performed with these relics.Justin
Martyr states that God once sent some angels to guard the human race,
that these angels fell in love with the daughters of men, and became the
fathers of innumerable devils.For hundreds of years miracles were
about the only things that happened.They were wrought by thousands of
Christians, and testified to by millions.The saints and martyrs, the
best and greatest, were the witnesses and workers of wonders.Even
heretics, with the assistance of the devil, could suspend the "laws
of nature."Must we believe these wonderful accounts because they were
written by "good men," by Christians," who made their statements in the
presence and expectation of death"?The truth is that these "good men"
were mistaken.They fed their minds on prodigies, and their imaginations
feasted on effects without causes.Doubts were regarded as "rude disturbers of the congregation."Credulity
and sanctity walked hand in hand.As the philosophy of the ancients was rendered almost worthless by the
credulity of the common people, so the proverbs of Christ, his religion
of forgiveness, his creed of kindness, were lost in the mist of miracle
and the darkness of superstition.The Honor Due to Christ

For the man Christ--for the reformer who loved his fellow-men--for the
man who believed in an Infinite Father, who would shield the innocent
and protect the just--for the martyr who expected to be rescued from the
cruel cross, and who at last, finding that his rope was dust, cried out
in the gathering gloom of death; "My God!--for that great and suffering man, mistaken though he was, I have
the highest admiration and respect.That man did not, as I believe,
claim a miraculous origin; he did not pretend to heal the sick nor raise
the dead.He claimed simply to be a man, and taught his fellow-men
that love is stronger far than hate.His life was written by reverent
ignorance.Loving credulity belittled his career with feats of jugglery
and magic art, and priests wishing to persecute and slay, put in his
mouth the words of hatred and revenge.The theological Christ is the
impossible union of the human and divine--man with the attributes of
God, and God with the limitations and weakness of man.Christianity has no Monopoly in Morals

The morality of the world is not distinctively Christian.Zoroaster,
Gautama, Mohammed, Confucius, Christ, and, in fact, all founders of
religions, have said to their disciples: You must not steal; You must
not murder; You must not bear false witness; You must discharge your
obligations.Christianity is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the
miraculous origin of Jesus Christ, his crucifixion, his resurrection,
his ascension, the inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the
atonement, and the necessity of belief.Buddhism is the ordinary moral
code, _plus_ the miraculous illumination of Buddha, the performance of
certain ceremonies, a belief in the transmigration of the soul, and
in the final absorption of the human by the infinite.The religion of
Mohammed is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the belief that Mohammed
was the prophet of God, total abstinence from the use of intoxicating
drinks, a harem for the faithful here and hereafter, ablutions, prayers,
alms, pilgrimages, and fasts.Old Age in Superstition's Lap

And here I take occasion to thank Mr.Black for having admitted that
Jehovah gave no commandment against the practice of polygamy, that he
established slavery, waged wars of extermination, and persecuted for
opinions' sake even unto death, Most theologians endeavor to putty,
patch, and paint the wretched record of inspired crime, but Mr.Black
has been bold enough and honest enough to admit the truth.In this age
of fact and demonstration it is refreshing to find a man who believes
so thoroughly in the monstrous and miraculous, the impossible and
immoral--who still clings lovingly to the legends of the bib and
rattle--who through the bitter experiences of a wicked world has kept
the credulity of the cradle, and finds comfort and joy in thinking about
the Garden of Eden, the subtile serpent, the flood, and Babel's tower,
stopped by the jargon of a thousand tongues--who reads with happy eyes
the story of the burning brimstone storm that fell upon the cities
of the plain, and smilingly explains the transformation of the
retrospective Mrs.Lot--who laughs at Egypt's plagues and Pharaoh's
whelmed and drowning hosts--eats manna with the wandering Jews, warms
himself at the burning bush, sees Korah's company by the hungry earth
devoured, claps his wrinkled hands with glee above the heathens'
butchered babes, and longingly looks back to the patriarchal days of
concubines and slaves.How touching when the learned and wise crawl back
in cribs and ask to hear the rhymes and fables once again!How charming
in these hard and scientific times to see old age in Superstition's lap,
with eager lips upon her withered breast!Ararat in Chicago

A little while ago, in the city of Chicago, a gentleman addressed a
number of Sunday-school children.In his address he stated that some
people were wicked enough to deny the story of the deluge; that he was
a traveler; that he had been to the top of Mount Ararat, and had brought
with him a stone from that sacred locality.The children were then
invited to form in procession and walk by the pulpit, for the purpose of
seeing this wonderful stone.After they had looked at it, the lecturer
said: "Now, children, if you ever hear anybody deny the story of the
deluge, or say that the ark did not rest on Mount Ararat, you can tell
them that you know better, because you have seen with your own eyes a
stone from that very mountain."How Gods and Devils are Made

It was supposed that God demanded worship; that he loved to be
flattered; that he delighted in sacrifice; that nothing made him happier
than to see ignorant faith upon its knees; that above all things he
hated and despised doubters and heretics, and regarded investigation as
rebellion.Each community felt it a duty to see that the enemies of God
were converted or killed.To allow a heretic to live in peace was
to invite the wrath of God.Every public evil--every misfortune--was
accounted for by something the community had permitted or done.When
epidemics appeared, brought by ignorance and welcomed by filth, the
heretic was brought out and sacrificed to appease the anger of God.By putting intention behind what man called good, God was produced.By
putting intention behind what man called bad, the Devil was created.Leave this "intention" out, and gods and devils fade away.If not a
human being existed, the sun would continue to shine, and tempest now
and then would devastate the earth; the rain would fall in pleasant
showers; violets would spread their velvet bosoms to the sun, the
earthquake would devour, birds would sing, and daisies bloom, and
roses blush, and volcanoes fill the heavens with their lurid glare; the
procession of the seasons would not be broken, and the stars would shine
as serenely as though the world were filled with loving hearts and happy
homes.The Romance of Figures

How long, according to the universal benevolence of the New Testament,
can a man be reasonably punished in the next world for failing to
believe something unreasonable in this?Can it be possible that any
punishment can endure forever?Suppose that every flake of snow that
ever fell was a figure nine, and that the first flake was multiplied by
the second, and that product by the third, and so on to the last flake.And then suppose that this total should be multiplied by every drop of
rain that ever fell, calling each drop a figure nine; and that total by
each blade of grass that ever helped to weave a carpet for the earth,
calling each blade a figure nine; and that again by every grain of sand
on every shore, so that the grand total would make a line of nines so
long that it would require millions upon millions of years for light,
traveling at the rate of one hundred and eighty-five thousand miles per
second, to reach the end.And suppose, further, that each unit in this
almost infinite total, stood for billions of ages--still that vast and
almost endless time, measured by all the years beyond, is as one flake,
one drop, one leaf, one blade, one grain, compared with all the flakes,
and drops, and leaves, and blades and grains.Upon love's breast the
Church has placed the eternal asp.And yet, in the same book in which is
taught this most infamous of doctrines, we are assured that "The Lord is
good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works."God and Zeno

If the Bible is inspired, Jehovah, God of all worlds, actually said:
"And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under
his hand, he shall be surely punished; notwithstanding, if he continue
a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money."And yet
Zeno, founder of the Stoics, centuries before Christ was born, insisted
that no man could be the owner of another, and that the title was bad,
whether the slave had become so by conquest, or by purchase.Jehovah,
ordered a Jewish general to make war, and gave, among others, this
command: "When the Lord thy God shall drive them before thee, thou shalt
smite them and utterly destroy them."And yet Epictetus, whom we have
already quoted, gave this marvelous rule for the guidance of human
conduct: "Live with thy inferiors as thou wouldst have thy superiors
live with thee."If Christ was in fact God, he knew all the future.Before him, like a
panorama, moved the history yet to be.He knew exactly how his words
would be interpreted.He knew what crimes, what horrors, what infamies,
would be committed in his name.He knew that the fires of persecution
would climb around the limbs of countless martyrs.He knew that brave
men would languish in dungeons, in darkness, filled with pain; that the
church would use instruments of torture, that his followers would appeal
to whip and chain.He must have seen the horizon of the future red with
the flames of the _auto da fe_.He knew all the creeds that would spring
like poison fungi from every text.He saw the sects waging war against
each other.He saw thousands of men, under the orders of priests,
building dungeons for their fellow-men.He heard the groans, saw the faces white with agony, the tears,
the blood--heard the shrieks and sobs of all the moaning, martyred
multitudes.He knew that commentaries would be written on his words with
swords, to be read by the light of fagots.He knew that the Inquisition
would be born of teachings attributed to him.He saw all the
interpolations and falsehoods that hypocrisy would write and tell.He
knew that above these fields of death, these dungeons, these burnings,
for a thousand years would float the dripping banner of the cross.He
knew that in his name his followers would trade in human flesh, that
cradles would be robbed and women's breasts unbabed for gold;--and yet
he died with voiceless lips.Why did he not
tell his disciples, and through them the world, that man should not
persecute, for opinion's sake, his fellow-man?Why did he not cry, You
shall not persecute in my name; you shall not burn and torment those who
differ from you in creed?Why did he not plainly say, I am the Son of
God?Why did he not explain the doctrine of the trinity?Why did he not
tell the manner of baptism that was pleasing to him?Why did he not say
something positive, definite, and satisfactory about another world?Why
did he not turn the tear-stained hope of heaven to the glad knowledge
of another life?Why did he go dumbly to his death, leaving the world to
misery and to doubt?The Philosophy of Action

Consequences determine the quality of an action.If consequences are
good, so is the action.If actions had no consequences, they would be
neither good nor bad.Man did not get his knowledge of the consequences
of actions from God, but from experience and reason.If man can, by
actual experiment, discover the right and wrong of actions, is it not
utterly illogical to declare that they who do not believe in God can
have no standard of right and wrong?Consequences are the standard by
which actions are judged.They are the children that testify as to the
real character of their parents.God or no God, larceny is the enemy of
industry--industry is the mother of prosperity--prosperity is a good,
and therefore larceny is an evil.God or no God, murder is a crime.There has always been a law against larceny, because the laborer wishes
to enjoy the fruit of his toil.As long as men object to being killed,
murder will be illegal.I have insisted, and I still insist, that it is still impossible for
a finite man to commit a crime deserving infinite punishment; and upon
this subject Mr.Black admits that "no revelation has lifted the veil
between time and eternity;" and, consequently, neither the priest nor
the "policeman" knows anything with certainty regarding another world.He simply insists that "in shadowy figures we are warned that a very
marked distinction will be made between the good and bad in the next
world."There is "a very marked distinction" in this; but there is this
rainbow in the darkest human cloud: The worst have hope of reform.All I
insist is, if there is another life, the basest soul that finds its way
to that dark or radiant shore will have the everlasting chance of
doing right.Nothing but the most cruel ignorance, the most heartless
superstition, the most ignorant theology, ever imagined that the
few days of human life spent here, surrounded by mists and clouds of
darkness, blown over life's sea by storms and tempests of passion, fixed
for all eternity the condition of the human race.If this doctrine be
true, this life is but a net, in which Jehovah catches souls for hell.We are told that "there is no good reason to doubt that the statements
of the Evangelists, as we have them now, are genuine."The fact is, no
one knows who made the "statements of the Evangelists."There are three
important manuscripts upon which the Christian world relies."The first
appeared in the catalogue of the Vatican, in 1475.Of the New, it contains the four gospels,--the Acts, the
seven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the
Epistle to the Hebrews, so far as the fourteenth verse of the ninth
chapter,"--and nothing more."The
second, the Alexandrine, was presented to King Charles the First, in
1628.It contains the Old and New Testaments, with some exceptions;
passages are wanting in Matthew, in John, and in II.It
also contains the Epistle of Clemens Romanus, a letter of Athanasius,
and the treatise of Eusebius on the Psalms."The last is the Sinaitic
Codex, discovered about 1850, at the Convent of St."It contains the Old and New Testaments, and in addition
the entire Epistle of Barnabas, and a portion of the Shepherd of
Hennas--two books which, up to the beginning of the fourth century, were
looked upon by many as Scripture."In this manuscript, or codex, the
gospel of St.Mark concludes with the eighth verse of the sixteenth
chapter, leaving out the frightful passage: "Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature.He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."In
matters of the utmost importance these manuscripts disagree, but even if
they all agreed it would not furnish the slightest evidence of their
truth.It will not do to call the statements made in the gospels
"depositions," until it is absolutely established who made them, and the
circumstances under which they were made.Neither can we say that "they
were made in the immediate prospect of death," until we know who made
them.It is absurd to say that "the witnesses could not have been
mistaken, because the nature of the facts precluded the possibility of
any delusion about them."Can it be pretended that the witnesses could
not have been mistaken about the relation the Holy Ghost is alleged to
have sustained to Jesus Christ?Is there no possibility of delusion
about a circumstance of that kind?Did the writers of the four gospels
have "the sensible and true avouch of their own eyes and ears" in that
behalf?How was it possible for any one of the four Evangelists to know
that Christ was the Son of God, or that he was God?Matthew says that an angel of the Lord told
Joseph in a dream, but Joseph never wrote an account of this wonderful
vision.Luke tells us that the angel had a conversation with Mary, and
that Mary told Elizabeth, but Elizabeth never wrote a word.There is no
account of Mary, or Joseph, or Elizabeth, or the angel, having had any
conversation with Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, in which one word was
said about the miraculous origin of Jesus Christ.The persons who knew
did not write, so that the account is nothing but hearsay.Black pretend that such statements would be admitted as evidence in any
court?But how do we know that the disciples of Christ wrote a word of
the gospels?How do we know
that the writers of the gospels "were men of unimpeachable character?"Black's Admission

For the purpose of defending the character of his infallible God, Mr.Black is forced to defend religious intolerance, wars of extermination,
human slavery, and almost polygamy.He admits that God established
slavery; that he commanded his chosen people to buy the children of the
heathen; that heathen fathers and mothers did right to sell their girls
and boys; that God ordered the Jews to wage wars of extermination and
conquest; that it was right to kill the old and young; that God forged
manacles for the human brain; that he commanded husbands to murder their
wives for suggesting the worship of the sun or moon; and that every
cruel, savage passage in the Old Testament was inspired by him.Such is
a "policeman's" view of God.The Stars Upon the Door of France

Mr.Black justifies all the crimes and horrors, excuses all the tortures
of all the Christian years, by denouncing the cruelties of the French
Revolution.Thinking people will not hasten to admit that an infinitely
good being authorized slavery in Judea, because of the atrocities of the
French Revolution.They will remember the sufferings of the Huguenots.They will not forget
the countless cruelties of priest and king.They will not forget the
dungeons of the Bastile.They will know that the Revolution was an
effect, and that liberty was not the cause--that atheism was not the
cause.Behind the Revolution they will see altar and throne--sword and
fagot--palace and cathedral--king and priest--master and slave--tyrant
and hypocrite.They will see that the excesses, the cruelties, and
crimes were but the natural fruit of seeds the church had sown.Upon that cloud of war, black with
the myriad miseries of a thousand years, dabbled with blood of king and
queen, of patriot and priest, there was this bow: "Beneath the flag of
France all men are free."In spite of all the blood and crime, in spite
of deeds that seem insanely base, the People placed upon a Nation's brow
these stars:--Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--grander words than ever
issued from Jehovah's lips.A KIND WORD FOR JOHN CHINAMAN

On the 27th day of March, 1880, Messrs.Wright, Dickey, O'Conner, and
Murch, of the Select Committee appointed by Congress to "Consider
the causes of the present depression of labor," presented the majority
special report on Chinese Immigration.The following quotations are
excerpts from Col.R. G. Ingersoll's caustic review of that report.The Select Committee Afraid

These gentlemen are in great fear for the future of our most holy and
perfectly authenticated religion, and have, like faithful watchmen,
from the walls and towers of Zion, hastened to give the alarm.They have
informed Congress that "Joss has his temple of worship in the Chinese
quarters, in San Francisco.Within the walls of a dilapidated structure
is exposed to the view of the faithful the God of the Chinaman, and here
are his altars of worship, Here he tears up his pieces of paper; here he
offers up his prayers; here he receives his religious consolations,
and here is his road to the celestial land."That "Joss is located in a
long, narrow room, in a building in a back alley, upon a kind of altar;"
that "he is a wooden image, looking as much like an alligator as like a
human being;" that the Chinese "think there is such a place as heaven;"
that "all classes of Chinamen worship idols;" that "the temple is open
every day at all hours;" that "the Chinese have no Sunday;" that this
heathen god has "huge jaws, a big red tongue, large white teeth, a half
dozen arms, and big, fiery, eyeballs.About him are placed offerings of
meat, and other eatables--a sacrificial offering."The Gods of the Joss-House and Patmos

No wonder that these members of the committee were shocked at such a
god, knowing as they did, that the only true God was correctly described
by the inspired lunatic of Patmos in the following words: "And there sat
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of
Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps
with a golden girdle.His head and his hairs were white like wool, as
white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like
unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the
sound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out
of his mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword; and his countenance was as
the sun shining in his strength."Certainly, a large mouth, filled
with white teeth, is preferable to one used as the scabbard of a sharp,
two-edged sword.Why should these gentlemen object to a god with big
fiery eyeballs, when their own Deity has eyes like a flame of fire?A Little Too Late

Is it not a little late in the day to object to people because they
sacrifice meat and other eatables to their god?We all know, that for
thousands of years the "real" God was exceedingly fond of roasted meat;
that He loved the savor of burning flesh, and delighted in the perfume
of fresh warm blood.Christianity has a Fair Show in San Francisco

The world is also informed by these gentlemen that "the idolatry of
the Chinese produces a demoralizing effect upon our American youth by
bringing sacred things into disrespect and making religion a theme of
disgust and contempt."In San Francisco there are some three hundred
thousand people.Is it possible that a few Chinese can bring "our holy
religion" into disgust and contempt?In that city there are fifty times
as many churches as joss-houses.Scores of sermons are uttered every
week; religious books and papers are plentiful as leaves in autumn, and
somewhat dryer; thousands of bibles are within the reach of all.An Arrow from the Quiver of Satire

And there, too, is the example of a Christian city.Why should we send
missionaries to China, if we cannot convert the heathen when they come
here?When missionaries go to a foreign land the poor benighted people
have to take their word for the blessings showered upon a Christian
people; but when the heathen come here, they can see for themselves.What was simply a story becomes a demonstrated fact.They come in
contact with people who love their enemies.They see that in a Christian
land men tell the truth; that they will not take advantage of strangers;
that they are just and patient; kind and tender; and have no prejudice
on account of color, race or religion; that they look upon mankind as
brethren; that they speak of God as a Universal Father, and are
willing to work and even to suffer, for the good, not only of their own
countrymen, but of the heathen as well.All this the Chinese see and
know, and why they still cling to the religion of their country is, to
me, a matter of amazement.We Have no Religious System

I take this, the earliest opportunity, to inform these gentlemen
composing a majority of the committee, that we have in the United States
no "religious system;" that this is a secular government.That it has
no religious creed; that it does not believe nor disbelieve in a future
state of reward or punishment; that it neither affirms nor denies the
existence of a "living" God.Congress Nothing to Do with Religion

Congress has nothing to do with the religion of the people.Its members
are not responsible to God for the opinions of their constituents, and
it may tend to the happiness of the constituents for me to state that
they are in no way responsible for the religion of the members.Religion
is an individual, not a national matter.And where the nation interferes
with the right of conscience, the liberties of the people are devoured
by the monster Superstition.But I am astonished that four Christian statesmen, four members of
Congress in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, who seriously
object to people on account of their religious convictions, should
still assert that the very religion in which they believe--and the only
religion established by the living god-head of the American system--is
not adapted to the spiritual needs of one-third of the human race.It is
amazing that these four gentlemen have, in the defense of the Christian
religion, announced the discovery that it is wholly inadequate for
the civilization of mankind; that the light of the cross can never
penetrate the darkness of China; "that all the labors of the missionary,
the example of the good, the exalted character of our civilization, make
no impression upon the pagan life of the Chinese;" and that even
the report of this committee will not tend to elevate, refine and
Christianize the yellow heathen of the Pacific coast.In the name
of religion these gentlemen have denied its power and mocked at the
enthusiasm of its founder.Worse than this, they have predicted for the
Chinese a future of ignorance and idolatry in this world, and, if the
"American system" of religion is true, hell-fire in the next.Do not Trample on John Chinaman

Do not trample upon these people because they have a different
conception of things about which even this committee knows nothing.Give them the same privilege you enjoy of making a God after their own
fashion.Would you be willing
to have them remain, if one of their race, thousands of years ago, had
pretended to have seen God, and had written of him as follows: "There
went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth; coals
were kindled by it, * * * and he rode upon a cherub and did fly."Why
should you object to these people on account of their religion?Your
objection has in it the spirit of hate and intolerance.That spirit lighted the fagot, made the
thumb-screw, put chains upon the limbs, and lashes upon the backs of
men.The same spirit bought and sold, captured and kidnapped human
beings; sold babes, and justified all the horrors of slavery.Be Honest with the Chinese

If you wish to drive out the Chinese, do not make a pretext of religion.Do not pretend that you are trying to do God a favor.Injustice in his
name is doubly detestable.The assassin cannot sanctify his dagger by
falling on his knees, and it does not help a falsehood if it be uttered
as a prayer.Religion, used, to intensify the hatred of men toward men,
under the pretense of pleasing God, has cursed this world.An Honest Merchant the Best Missionary

I am almost sure that I have read somewhere that "Christ died for _all_
men," and that "God is no respecter of persons."It was once taught
that it was the duty of Christians to tell to all people the "tidings of
great joy."I have never believed these things myself, but have always
contended that an honest merchant was the best missionary.Commerce
makes friends, religion makes enemies; the one enriches, and the other
impoverishes; the one thrives best where the truth is told, the other
where falsehoods are believed.For myself, I have but little confidence
in any business, or enterprise, or investment, that promises dividends
only after the death of the stockholders.Good Words from Confucius

For the benefit of these four philosophers and prophets, I will give a
few extracts from the writings of Confucius that will, in my judgment,
compare favorably with the best passages of their report:

"My doctrine is that man must be true to the principles of his nature,
and the benevolent exercises of them toward others.""With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and with my bended arm
for a pillow, I still have joy.""Riches and honor acquired by injustice are to me but floating clouds.""The man who, in view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who, in view of
danger, forgets life; and who remembers an old agreement, however far
back it extends, such a man may be reckoned a complete man.""Recompense injury with justice, and kindness with kindness."There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's
life: Reciprocity is that word.The Ancient Chinese

When the ancestors of the four Christian Congressmen were barbarians,
when they lived in caves, gnawed bones, and worshiped dry snakes; the
infamous Chinese were reading these sublime sentences of Confucius.When
the forefathers of these Christian statesmen were hunting toads to
get the jewels out of their heads to be used as charms, the wretched
Chinamen were calculating eclipses, and measuring the circumference
of the earth.When the progenitors of these representatives of the
"American system of religion" were burning women charged with nursing
devils, these people "incapable of being influenced by the exalted
character of our civilization," were building asylums for the insane.The Chinese and Civil Service Reform

Neither should it be forgotten that, for thousands of years, the Chinese
have honestly practised the great principle known as civil service
reform--a something that even the administration of Mr.Hayes has
reached only through the proxy of promise.Invading China in the Name of Opium and Christ

The English battered down the door of China in the names of Opium and
Christ.This infamy was regarded as another triumph of the gospel.At last in self-defense the Chinese allowed Christians to touch their
shores.Their wise men, their philosophers, protested, and prophesied
that time would show that Christians could not be trusted.This re port
proves that the wise men were not only philosophers but prophets.Don't be Dishonest in the Name of God

Treat China as you would England.Change it if you will, according to the laws of nations, but on no
account excuse a breach of national faith by pretending that we are
dishonest for God's sake.CONCERNING CREEDS AND THE TYRANNY OF SECTS




482.Diversity of Opinion Abolished by Henry VIII

In the reign of Henry VIII--that pious and moral founder of the
apostolic Episcopal Church,--there was passed by the parliament
of England an act entitled, "An act for abolishing of diversity of
opinion."And in this act was set forth what a good Christian was
obliged to believe:

First, That in the sacrament was the real body and blood of Jesus
Christ.Second, That the body and blood of Jesus Christ was in the bread, and
the blood and body of Jesus Christ was in the wine.Fourth, That vows of chastity were of perpetual obligation.Fifth, That private masses ought to be continued; and,

Sixth, That auricular confession to a priest must be maintained.This creed was made by law, in order that all men might know just what
to believe by simply reading the statute.The Church hated to see the
people wearing out their brains in thinking upon these subjects.Spencer and Darwin Damned

According to the philosophy of theology, man has continued to degenerate
for six thousand years.To teach that there is that in nature which
impels to higher forms and grander ends, is heresy, of course.The
Deity will damn Spencer and his "Evolution," Darwin and his "Origin
of Species," Bastian and his "Spontaneous Generation," Huxley and his
"Protoplasm," Tyndall and his "Prayer Gauge," and will save those, and
those only, who declare that the universe has been cursed, from the
smallest atom to the grandest star; that everything tends to evil and to
that only, and that the only perfect thing in nature is the Presbyterian
Confession of Faith.The Dead do Not Persecute

Imagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The
end that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are
orthodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated
church.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,
side by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this
difference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois

The supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that
an unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not
be allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have
been murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other
witnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He
was liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to
contribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges
who decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any
court.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption
of the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored
to chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot

Now and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,
and has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious
get together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most
prophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the
tree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students

Thousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various
Churches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate
the phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only
object, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may
learn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in
the dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus
trained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,
he is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly
impossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you
think the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it
wrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,
that most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of
fear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy

A trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in
the Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it
still thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined
to prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are
shambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that
the Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with
force.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be
bound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and
dungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening

Fortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon
the Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and
sciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,
succumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,
but by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a
relic of the past.The cry of "heresy" has been growing fainter and
fainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination
have ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of
infants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist "Hoist with his own Petard."A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a
piece of friendly advice."Although you may disbelieve the bible," said
he, "you ought not to say so."Do
you believe the bible," said I. He replied, "Most assuredly."To which
I retorted, "Your answer conveys no information to me.You may be
following your own advice.Of
course a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be
particular about telling the truth himself."The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity

What a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human
heart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and
great were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother
bears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of
the natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;
that for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to
heaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling
in the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy

Whoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be
guilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name
given by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of
the hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and
who, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of
intellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet
used in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian
era, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment
inflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This
effort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the
salvation of the soul.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as
certainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They
do not say, "we _think_ this is so," but "we _know_ this is so."They do
not appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They
keep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing
has been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the
authority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly
sin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation
of superstition has always horrified the Church.By some unaccountable
infatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense
importance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will
forever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts
or denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.To practice
justice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some
incomprehensible creed.You must say, "Once one is three, and three
times one is one."The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to
believe, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church
as a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago

One hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have
perished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in
England, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves
in the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their
ears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads
branded.The Despotism of Faith

The despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian
countries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time
the same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,
in Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the
world, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the
assumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware

And what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says
a heretic, "Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your
children cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I
will hunt you to the very portals of the grave."Calvin's Petrified Heart

Luther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor
of his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified
heart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly
declared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the
founders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous
tenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily
inconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion
as to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Common sense
belongs exclusively to no tongue.Logic is not confined to, nor has it
been buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is
translated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue
of Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: "O Jupiter!He then added: "Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven
again, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you
were prostrate."The Tail of a Lion

There is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the
tail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think
and act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they
join something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party
can act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to
pay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself
about the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept

The fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The
fall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began
to have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the
congregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories
themselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short
of irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside
world was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while
the church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress

Christianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human
race.Across the highway of progress it has always been building
breastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,
dogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered
together behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of
malice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into
a deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
crowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of
hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you
will not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to
smilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not
been found.The Real Eden is Beyond

Nations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy
becomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the
years sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are
behind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for
knowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,
it will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men

Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,
Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and
women.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All
other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
given up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS




507.On which of the six days was he
created?Is it possible that God would make a successful
rival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what
a snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced
woman.He knew that if the serpent
got into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive
them out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he
himself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be
good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman
was a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to
take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it
not possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these
fables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God
take him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam
and Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not
acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's
reputation.Questions About the Ark

How was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what
was done with the filth?How were some
portions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others
kept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their
respective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,
and they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things
must have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept
up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the
slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the
plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate
rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and
so sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon
their health.Of course, all the polar
bears did not go.It could be confounded only by the
destruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at
that time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain
presiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak
the words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch
the brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in
the machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the
language of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man
to be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in
the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take
myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a
holy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,
candlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,
at the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put
any of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,
the Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,
that whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off
from his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot
believe it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
are?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
earth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters
happen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of
others?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a
legal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an
altar?Were the
stealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and
eloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these
things; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who
will burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who
burns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the
investigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,
laugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase
or decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an
eternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has
not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
entitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat
this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG

I do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the
clouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,
soil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every
heretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast
out and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give
his individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really
valuable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or
State solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically
we are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect
minds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give
up your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory
of reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,
the ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:
"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of
man."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,
but after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of
men and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the
human heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only
justice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the
same as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been
wet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne
have leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated
to excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his
existence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the
conditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what
would have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen
is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all
religions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our
right to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his
intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this
sense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own
in which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all
the gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;
they have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think
a man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long
time.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike
ourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than
servile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt
to ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any
time, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from
human speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of
the Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too
much thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the
sword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition
Science has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality
enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one
who had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the
moon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church.""On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and
success.INGERSOLL'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE

     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother
     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs
     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our
     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish
     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would
do for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were
falling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest
point; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,
using his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that
kisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured
with the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour
of all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a
sunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther
shore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every
life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment
jeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep
and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but
in the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic
souls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to
tears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly
gave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully
discharged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand
times I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a
temple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only
good, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only
religion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;
and were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom
to his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet
flowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,
and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless
lips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the
return of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that
these dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,
to do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR

     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were
     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran
     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the
great struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the
music of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We
see thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see
the pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those
assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the
great army of freedom.Some are
walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they
adore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as
they lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing
babes that are asleep.Some are parting with
mothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,
and say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand
waves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,
keeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the
great cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the
fields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory
fields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand
guard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with
them in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are
with them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,
the life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them
pierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in
the whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech
can never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden
in the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man
bowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
governed by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the
strokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through
tangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the
sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
brutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner
of the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting
shell.Instead of
slaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches
the auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see
homes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want
and crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They
are at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag
they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the
tearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of
the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less
palace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In
the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of
death.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for
the living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by
vermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother
of all abominations, the devil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva

The Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought

Prejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the
home.I believe in truth, in
investigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and
intelligence.--
    "I thank thee, Roderick, for the word!It nerves my heart, it steels my sword;
    For I have sworn this braid to stain
    In the best blood that warms thy vein.and, ruth, begone!--
    Yet think not that by thee alone,
    Proud Chief!can courtesy be shown;
    Though not from copse, or heath, or cairn,
    Start at my whistle clansmen stern,
    Of this small horn one feeble blast
    Would fearful odds against thee cast.But fear not--doubt not--which thou wilt--
    We try this quarrel hilt to hilt."--
    Then each at once his falchion drew,
    Each on the ground his scabbard threw,
    Each look'd to sun, and stream, and plain,
    As what they ne'er might see again;
    Then foot, and point, and eye opposed,
    In dubious strife they darkly closed.Ill fared it then with Roderick Dhu,
    That on the field his targe he threw,
    Whose brazen studs and tough bull hide
    Had death so often dash'd aside;
    For, train'd abroad[292] his arms to wield,
    Fitz-James's blade was sword and shield.He practiced every pass and ward,
    To thrust, to strike, to feint, to guard;
    While less expert, though stronger far,
    The Gael maintain'd unequal war.Three times in closing strife they stood,
    And thrice the Saxon blade drank blood;
    No stinted draught, no scanty tide,
    The gushing flood the tartans dyed.Fierce Roderick felt the fatal drain,
    And shower'd his blows like wintry rain;
    And, as firm rock, or castle roof,
    Against the winter shower is proof,
    The foe, invulnerable still,
    Foil'd his wild rage by steady skill;
    Till, at advantage ta'en, his brand
    Forced Roderick's weapon from his hand,
    And backward borne upon the lea,
    Brought the proud Chieftain to his knee."Now, yield thee, or by Him who made
    The world, thy heart's blood dyes my blade!"--
    "Thy threats, thy mercy, I defy!Let recreant yield, who fears to die."--Like adder darting from his coil,
    Like wolf that dashes through the toil,
    Like mountain cat who guards her young,
    Full at Fitz-James's throat he sprung;
    Received, but reck'd not of a wound,
    And lock'd his arms his foeman round.--
    Now, gallant Saxon, hold thine own!That desperate grasp thy frame might feel,
    Through bars of brass and triple steel!--
    They tug, they strain!down, down they go,
    The Gael above, Fitz-James below.The Chieftain's gripe his throat compress'd,
    His knee was planted in his breast;
    His clotted locks he backward threw,
    Across his brow his hand he drew,
    From blood and mist to clear his sight,
    Then gleam'd aloft his dagger bright!--
    --But hate and fury ill supplied
    The stream of life's exhausted tide,
    And all too late the advantage came,
    To turn the odds of deadly game;
    For, while the dagger gleam'd on high,
    Reel'd soul and sense, reel'd brain and eye.but in the heath
    The erring blade found bloodless sheath.The struggling foe may now unclasp
    The fainting Chief's relaxing grasp;
    Unwounded from the dreadful close,
    But breathless all, Fitz-James arose.He falter'd thanks to Heaven for life,
    Redeem'd, unhoped, from desperate strife;
    Next on his foe his look he cast,
    Whose every gasp appear'd his last;
    In Roderick's gore he dipt the braid,--
    "Poor Blanche!thy wrongs are dearly paid:
    Yet with thy foe must die, or live,
    The praise that Faith and Valor give."With that he blew a bugle note,
    Undid the collar from his throat,
    Unbonneted, and by the wave
    Sate down his brow and hands to lave.Then faint afar are heard the feet
    Of rushing steeds in gallop fleet;
    The sounds increase, and now are seen
    Four mounted squires in Lincoln green;
    Two who bear lance, and two who lead,
    By loosen'd rein, a saddled steed;
    Each onward held his headlong course,
    And by Fitz-James rein'd up his horse,--
    With wonder view'd the bloody spot--
    "Exclaim not, gallants!question not.--
    You, Herbert and Luffness, alight,
    And bind the wounds of yonder knight;
    Let the gray palfrey bear his weight,
    We destined for a fairer freight,
    And bring him on to Stirling straight;
    I will before at better speed,
    To seek fresh horse and fitting weed.The sun rides high;--I must be boune,
    To see the archer game at noon;
    But lightly Bayard clears the lea.--
    De Vaux and Herries, follow me."--the steed obey'd,
    With arching neck and bended head,
    And glancing eye and quivering ear,
    As if he loved his lord to hear.No foot Fitz-James in stirrup stayed,
    No grasp upon the saddle laid,
    But wreath'd his left hand in the mane,
    And lightly bounded from the plain,
    Turn'd on the horse his armed heel,
    And stirr'd his courage with the steel.[293]
    Bounded the fiery steed in air,
    The rider sate erect and fair,
    Then like a bolt from steel crossbow
    Forth launch'd, along the plain they go.They dash'd that rapid torrent through,
    And up Carhonie's[294] hill they flew;
    Still at the gallop prick'd[295] the Knight,
    His merry-men follow'd as they might.they ride,
    And in the race they mock thy tide;
    Torry and Lendrick now are past,
    And Deanstown lies behind them cast;
    They rise, the banner'd towers of Doune,
    They sink in distant woodland soon;
    Blair-Drummond sees the hoofs strike fire,
    They sweep like breeze through Ochtertyre;
    They mark just glance and disappear
    The lofty brow of ancient Kier;
    They bathe their coursers' sweltering sides,
    Dark Forth!amid thy sluggish tides,
    And on the opposing shore take ground,
    With plash, with scramble, and with bound.Right-hand they leave thy cliffs, Craig-Forth!And soon the bulwark of the North,
    Gray Stirling, with her towers and town,
    Upon their fleet career look'd down.[294] About a mile from the mouth of Lake Vennachar.As up the flinty path they strain'd,
    Sudden his steed the leader rein'd;
    A signal to his squire he flung,
    Who instant to his stirrup sprung:--
    "Seest thou, De Vaux, yon woodsman gray,
    Who townward holds the rocky way,
    Of stature tall and poor array?Mark'st thou the firm, yet active stride,
    With which he scales the mountain side?Know'st thou from whence he comes, or whom?"--
    "No, by my word;--a burly groom
    He seems, who in the field or chase
    A baron's train would nobly grace."--
    "Out, out, De Vaux!can fear supply,
    And jealousy, no sharper eye?Afar, ere to the hill he drew,
    That stately form and step I knew;
    Like form in Scotland is not seen,
    Treads not such step on Scottish green.'Tis James of Douglas, by St.Away, away, to court, to show
    The near approach of dreaded foe:
    The King must stand upon his guard;
    Douglas and he must meet prepared."Then right-hand wheel'd their steeds, and straight
    They won the Castle's postern gate.The Douglas, who had bent his way
    From Cambus-kenneth's Abbey gray,
    Now, as he climb'd the rocky shelf,
    Held sad communion with himself:--
    "Yes!all is true my fears could frame;
    A prisoner lies the noble Graeme,
    And fiery Roderick soon will feel
    The vengeance of the royal steel.I, only I, can ward their fate,--
    God grant the ransom come not late!The Abbess hath her promise given,
    My child shall be the bride of Heaven;[296]--
    --Be pardon'd one repining tear!For He, who gave her, knows how dear,
    How excellent!but that is by,
    And now my business is--to die.within whose circuit dread
    A Douglas[297] by his sovereign bled;
    And thou, O sad and fatal mound![298]
    That oft hast heard the death-ax sound,
    As on the noblest of the land
    Fell the stern headsman's bloody hand,--
    The dungeon, block, and nameless tomb
    Prepare--for Douglas seeks his doom!--
    --But hark!what blithe and jolly peal
    Makes the Franciscan[299] steeple reel?upon the crowded street,
    In motley groups what maskers meet!Banner and pageant, pipe and drum,
    And merry morris dancers[300] come.I guess, by all this quaint array,
    The burghers hold their sports to-day.[301]
    James will be there; he loves such show,
    Where the good yeoman bends his bow,
    And the tough wrestler foils his foe,
    As well as where, in proud career,
    The high-born tilter shivers spear.I'll follow to the Castle-park,
    And play my prize;--King James shall mark,
    If age has tamed these sinews stark,[302]
    Whose force so oft, in happier days,
    His boyish wonder loved to praise."[296] "Bride of Heaven," i.e., a nun.[297] William, eighth earl of Douglas, was stabbed by James II.while
in Stirling Castle, and under royal safe-conduct.[298] "Heading Hill," where executions took place.[299] A church of the Franciscans or Gray Friars was built near the
castle, in 1494, by James IV.[300] The morris dance was of Moorish origin, and brought from Spain
to England, where it was combined with the national Mayday games.The
dress of the dancers was adorned with party- ribbons, and little
bells were attached to their anklets, armlets, or girdles.The dancers
often personated various fictitious characters.[301] Every borough had its solemn play or festival, where archery,
wrestling, hurling the bar, and other athletic exercises, were engaged
in.The Castle gates were open flung,
    The quivering drawbridge rock'd and rung,
    And echo'd loud the flinty street
    Beneath the coursers' clattering feet,
    As slowly down the steep descent
    Fair Scotland's King and nobles went,
    While all along the crowded way
    Was jubilee and loud huzza.And ever James was bending low,
    To his white jennet's[303] saddlebow,
    Doffing his cap to city dame,
    Who smiled and blush'd for pride and shame.And well the simperer might be vain,--
    He chose the fairest of the train.Gravely he greets each city sire,
    Commends each pageant's quaint attire,
    Gives to the dancers thanks aloud,
    And smiles and nods upon the crowd,
    Who rend the heavens with their acclaims,--
    "Long live the Commons' King,[304] King James!"Behind the King throng'd peer and knight,
    And noble dame, and damsel bright,
    Whose fiery steeds ill brook'd the stay
    Of the steep street and crowded way.--But in the train you might discern
    Dark lowering brow, and visage stern:
    There nobles mourn'd their pride restrain'd,
    And the mean burgher's joys disdain'd;
    And chiefs, who, hostage for their clan,
    Were each from home a banish'd man,
    There thought upon their own gray tower,
    Their waving woods, their feudal power,
    And deem'd themselves a shameful part
    Of pageant which they cursed in heart.in France, James V.
had checked the lawless nobles, and favored the commons or burghers.Now, in the Castle-park, drew out
    Their checker'd[305] bands the joyous rout.There morrisers, with bell at heel,
    And blade in hand, their mazes wheel;
    But chief, beside the butts, there stand
    Bold Robin Hood[306] and all his band,--
    Friar Tuck with quarterstaff and cowl,
    Old Scathlock with his surly scowl,
    Maid Marian, fair as ivory bone,
    Scarlet, and Mutch, and Little John;[307]
    Their bugles challenge all that will,
    In archery to prove their skill.The Douglas bent a bow of might,--
    His first shaft centered in the white,
    And when in turn he shot again,
    His second split the first in twain.From the King's hand must Douglas take
    A silver dart,[308] the archer's stake;
    Fondly he watch'd, with watery eye,
    Some answering glance of sympathy,--
    No kind emotion made reply!Indifferent as to archer wight,[309]
    The Monarch gave the arrow bright.[305] In clothing of varied form and color.[306] A renowned English outlaw and robber, supposed to have lived at
the end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century, and to
have frequented Sherwood Forest.Characters representing him and his
followers were often introduced into the popular games.[307] All six were followers of Robin Hood.[308] The usual prize to the best shooter was a silver arrow.[309] A simple, ordinary archer.for, hand to hand,
    The manly wrestlers take their stand.Two o'er the rest superior rose,
    And proud demanded mightier foes,
    Nor call'd in vain; for Douglas came.--For life is Hugh of Larbert lame;
    Scarce better John of Alloa's fare,
    Whom senseless home his comrades bear.Prize of the wrestling match, the King
    To Douglas gave a golden ring,
    While coldly glanced his eye of blue,
    As frozen drop of wintry dew.Douglas would speak, but in his breast
    His struggling soul his words suppress'd;
    Indignant then he turn'd him where
    Their arms the brawny yeoman bare,
    To hurl the massive bar in air.When each his utmost strength had shown,
    The Douglas rent an earth-fast stone
    From its deep bed, then heaved it high,
    And sent the fragment through the sky,
    A rood beyond the farthest mark;--
    And still in Stirling's royal park,
    The gray-haired sires, who know the past,
    To strangers point the Douglas-cast,[310]
    And moralize on the decay
    Of Scottish strength in modern day.The vale with loud applauses rang,
    The Ladies' Rock[311] sent back the clang.The King, with look unmoved, bestow'd
    A purse well fill'd with pieces broad.Indignant smiled the Douglas proud,
    And threw the gold among the crowd,
    Who now, with anxious wonder, scan,
    And sharper glance, the dark gray man;
    Till whispers rose among the throng,
    That heart so free, and hand so strong,
    Must to the Douglas blood belong;
    The old men mark'd, and shook the head,
    To see his hair with silver spread,
    And wink'd aside, and told each son
    Of feats upon the English done,
    Ere Douglas of the stalwart hand
    Was exiled from his native land.The women praised his stately form,
    Though wreck'd by many a winter's storm;
    The youth with awe and wonder saw
    His strength surpassing nature's law.Thus judged, as is their wont, the crowd,
    Till murmur rose to clamors loud.But not a glance from that proud ring
    Of peers who circled round the King,
    With Douglas held communion kind,
    Or call'd the banish'd man to mind;
    No, not from those who, at the chase,
    Once held his side the honor'd place,
    Begirt[312] his board, and, in the field,
    Found safety underneath his shield;
    For he, whom royal eyes disown,
    When was his form to courtiers known![311] A point from which the ladies of the court viewed the games.The Monarch saw the gambols flag,
    And bade let loose a gallant stag,
    Whose pride, the holiday to crown,
    Two favorite greyhounds should pull down,
    That venison free, and Bordeaux wine,
    Might serve the archery to dine.But Lufra,--whom from Douglas' side
    Nor bribe nor threat could e'er divide,
    The fleetest hound in all the North,--
    Brave Lufra saw, and darted forth.She left the royal hounds midway,
    And dashing on the antler'd prey,
    Sunk her sharp muzzle in his flank,
    And deep the flowing lifeblood drank.The King's stout huntsman saw the sport
    By strange intruder broken short,
    Came up, and with his leash unbound,
    In anger struck the noble hound.--The Douglas had endured, that morn,
    The King's cold look, the nobles' scorn,
    And last, and worst to spirit proud,
    Had borne the pity of the crowd;
    But Lufra had been fondly bred,
    To share his board, to watch his bed,
    And oft would Ellen, Lufra's neck
    In maiden glee with garlands deck;
    They were such playmates, that with name
    Of Lufra, Ellen's image came.His stifled wrath is brimming high,
    In darken'd brow and flashing eye;
    As waves before the bark divide,
    The crowd gave way before his stride;
    Needs but a buffet and no more,
    The groom lies senseless in his gore.Such blow no other hand could deal
    Though gauntleted in glove of steel.Then clamor'd loud the royal train,
    And brandish'd swords and staves amain.But stern the baron's warning--"Back!Back, on[313] your lives, ye menial pack!behold,
    King James!The Douglas, doom'd of old,
    And vainly sought for near and far,
    A victim to atone the war,
    A willing victim, now attends,
    Nor craves thy grace but for his friends."--
    "Thus is my clemency repaid?the Monarch said;
    "Of thy mis-proud[314] ambitious clan,
    Thou, James of Bothwell, wert the man,
    The only man, in whom a foe
    My woman mercy would not know:
    But shall a Monarch's presence brook
    Injurious blow, and haughty look?--
    What ho!Give the offender fitting ward.--
    Break off the sports!"--for tumult rose,
    And yeomen 'gan to bend their bows,--
    "Break off the sports!"he said, and frown'd,
    "And bid our horsemen clear the ground."Then uproar wild and misarray[315]
    Marr'd the fair form of festal day.The horsemen prick'd among the crowd,
    Repell'd by threats and insult loud;
    To earth are borne the old and weak,
    The timorous fly, the women shriek;
    With flint, with shaft, with staff, with bar,
    The hardier urge tumultuous war.At once round Douglas darkly sweep
    The royal spears in circle deep,
    And slowly scale the pathway steep;
    While on the rear in thunder pour
    The rabble with disorder'd roar.With grief the noble Douglas saw
    The Commons rise against the law,
    And to the leading soldier said,--
    "Sir John of Hyndford![316] 'twas my blade
    That knighthood on thy shoulder laid;[317]
    For that good deed, permit me then
    A word with these misguided men."[317] Knighthood was conferred by a slight blow with the flat of a
sword on the back of the kneeling candidate.ere yet for me
    Ye break the bands of fealty.My life, my honor, and my cause,
    I tender free to Scotland's laws.Are these so weak as must require
    The aid of your misguided ire?Or, if I suffer causeless wrong,
    Is then my selfish rage so strong,
    My sense of public weal so low,
    That, for mean vengeance on a foe,
    Those cords of love I should unbind,
    Which knit my country and my kind?Believe, in yonder tower
    It will not soothe my captive hour,
    To know those spears our foes should dread,
    For me in kindred gore are red;
    To know, in fruitless brawl begun
    For me, that mother wails her son;
    For me, that widow's mate expires;
    For me, that orphans weep their sires;
    That patriots mourn insulted laws,
    And curse the Douglas for the cause.Oh, let your patience ward[318] such ill,
    And keep your right to love me still!"The crowd's wild fury sunk again
    In tears, as tempests melt in rain.With lifted hands and eyes, they pray'd
    For blessings on his generous head,
    Who for his country felt alone,
    And prized her blood beyond his own.Old men, upon the verge of life,
    Bless'd him who stayed the civil strife;
    And mothers held their babes on high,
    The self-devoted Chief to spy,
    Triumphant over wrongs and ire,
    To whom the prattlers owed a sire:
    Even the rough soldier's heart was moved;
    As if behind some bier beloved,
    With trailing arms and drooping head,
    The Douglas up the hill he led,
    And at the Castle's battled verge,
    With sighs resign'd his honor'd charge.The offended Monarch rode apart,
    With bitter thought and swelling heart,
    And would not now vouchsafe again
    Through Stirling streets to lead his train.--
    "O Lennox, who would wish to rule
    This changeling[319] crowd, this common fool?Hear'st thou," he said, "the loud acclaim
    With which they shout the Douglas name?With like acclaim, the vulgar throat
    Strain'd for King James their morning note;
    With like acclaim they hail'd the day
    When first I broke the Douglas' sway;
    And like acclaim would Douglas greet,
    If he could hurl me from my seat.Who o'er the herd would wish to reign,
    Fantastic, fickle, fierce, and vain!Vain as the leaf upon the stream,
    And fickle as a changeful dream;
    Fantastic as a woman's mood,
    And fierce as Frenzy's fever'd blood,
    Thou many-headed monster thing,
    Oh, who would wish to be thy king!"what messenger of speed
    Spurs hitherward his panting steed?I guess his cognizance[320] afar--
    What from our cousin,[321] John of Mar?"--
    "He prays, my liege, your sports keep bound
    Within the safe and guarded ground:
    For some foul purpose yet unknown,--
    Most sure for evil to the throne,--
    The outlaw'd Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
    Has summon'd his rebellious crew;
    'Tis said, in James of Bothwell's aid
    These loose banditti stand array'd.The Earl of Mar, this morn, from Doune,
    To break their muster march'd, and soon
    Your grace will hear of battle fought;
    But earnestly the Earl besought,
    Till for such danger he provide,
    With scanty train you will not ride."[321] Monarchs frequently applied this epithet to their noblemen, even
when no blood relationship existed."Thou warn'st me I have done amiss,--
    I should have earlier look'd to this:
    I lost it in this bustling day.--Retrace with speed thy former way;
    Spare not for spoiling of thy steed,
    The best of mine shall be thy meed.Say to our faithful Lord of Mar,
    We do forbid the intended war:
    Roderick, this morn, in single fight,
    Was made our prisoner by a knight;
    And Douglas hath himself and cause
    Submitted to our kingdom's laws.The tidings of their leaders lost
    Will soon dissolve the mountain host,
    Nor would we that the vulgar feel,
    For their Chief's crimes, avenging steel.Bear Mar our message, Braco: fly!"--
    He turn'd his steed,--"My liege, I hie,--
    Yet, ere I cross this lily lawn,
    I fear the broadswords will be drawn."The turf the flying courser spurn'd,
    And to his towers the King return'd.Ill with King James's mood that day,
    Suited gay feast and minstrel lay;
    Soon were dismiss'd the courtly throng,
    And soon cut short the festal song.Nor less upon the sadden'd town
    The evening sunk in sorrow down.The burghers spoke of civil jar,
    Of rumor'd feuds and mountain war,
    Of Moray, Mar, and Roderick Dhu,
    All up in arms:--the Douglas too,
    They mourn'd him pent within the hold,
    "Where stout Earl William[322] was of old."--
    And there his word the speaker stayed,
    And finger on his lip he laid,
    Or pointed to his dagger blade.But jaded horsemen, from the west,
    At evening to the Castle press'd;
    And busy talkers said they bore
    Tidings of fight on Katrine's shore;
    At noon the deadly fray begun,
    And lasted till the set of sun.Thus giddy rumor shook the town,
    Till closed the Night her pennons brown.[322] The Douglas who was stabbed by James II.I.

    The sun, awakening, through the smoky air
      Of the dark city casts a sullen glance,
    Rousing each caitiff[323] to his task of care,
      Of sinful man the sad inheritance;
    Summoning revelers from the lagging dance,
      Scaring the prowling robber to his den;
    Gilding on battled tower the warder's lance,
      And warning student pale to leave his pen,
    And yield his drowsy eyes to the kind nurse of men.what scenes of woe,
      Are witness'd by that red and struggling beam!The fever'd patient, from his pallet low,
      Through crowded hospital beholds its stream;
    The ruin'd maiden trembles at its gleam,
      The debtor wakes to thought of gyve and jail,
    The lovelorn wretch starts from tormenting dream;
      The wakeful mother, by the glimmering pale,
    Trims her sick infant's couch, and soothes his feeble wail.At dawn the towers of Stirling rang
    With soldier step and weapon clang,
    While drums, with rolling note, foretell
    Relief to weary sentinel.Through narrow loop and casement barr'd,
    The sunbeams sought the Court of Guard,
    And, struggling with the smoky air,
    Deaden'd the torches' yellow glare.In comfortless alliance shone
    The lights through arch of blacken'd stone,
    And show'd wild shapes in garb of war,
    Faces deform'd with beard and scar,
    All haggard from the midnight watch,
    And fever'd with the stern debauch;
    For the oak table's massive board,
    Flooded with wine, with fragments stored,
    And beakers drain'd, and cups o'erthrown,
    Show'd in what sport the night had flown.Some, weary, snored on floor and bench;
    Some labor'd still their thirst to quench;
    Some, chill'd with watching, spread their hands
    O'er the huge chimney's dying brands,
    While round them, or beside them flung,
    At every step their harness[324] rung.[324] Armor and other accouterments of war.These drew not for their fields the sword,
    Like tenants of a feudal lord,
    Nor own'd the patriarchal claim
    Of Chieftain in their leader's name;
    Adventurers[325] they, from far who roved,
    To live by battle which they loved.There the Italian's clouded face,
    The swarthy Spaniard's there you trace;
    The mountain-loving Switzer[326] there
    More freely breathed in mountain air;
    The Fleming[327] there despised the soil,
    That paid so ill the laborer's toil;
    Their rolls show'd French and German name;
    And merry England's exiles came,
    To share, with ill-conceal'd disdain,
    Of Scotland's pay the scanty gain.All brave in arms, well train'd to wield
    The heavy halberd, brand, and shield;
    In camps licentious, wild, and bold;
    In pillage fierce and uncontroll'd;
    And now, by holytide[328] and feast,
    From rules of discipline released.[325] James V. was the first to increase the army furnished by
the nobles and their vassals by the addition of a small number of
mercenaries.[327] An inhabitant of Flanders, as Belgium was then called.They held debate of bloody fray,
    Fought 'twixt Loch Katrine and Achray.Fierce was their speech, and,'mid their words,
    Their hands oft grappled to their swords;
    Nor sunk their tone to spare the ear
    Of wounded comrades groaning near,
    Whose mangled limbs, and bodies gored,
    Bore token of the mountain sword,
    Though, neighboring to the Court of Guard,
    Their prayers and feverish wails were heard;
    Sad burden to the ruffian joke,
    And savage oath by fury spoke!--
    At length up started John of Brent,
    A yeoman from the banks of Trent;
    A stranger to respect or fear,
    In peace a chaser[329] of the deer,
    In host[330] a hardy mutineer,
    But still the boldest of the crew,
    When deed of danger was to do.He grieved, that day, their games cut short,
    And marr'd the dicer's brawling sport,
    And shouted loud, "Renew the bowl!And, while a merry catch I troll,
    Let each the buxom chorus bear,
    Like brethren of the brand and spear."V.

SOLDIER'S SONG.Our vicar still preaches that Peter and Poule[331]
    Laid a swinging[332] long curse on the bonny brown bowl,
    That there's wrath and despair in the jolly black-jack,[333]
    And the seven deadly sins in a flagon of sack;[334]
    Yet whoop, Barnaby!off with thy liquor,
    Drink upsees out,[335] and a fig for the vicar!Our vicar he calls it damnation to sip
    The ripe ruddy dew of a woman's dear lip,
    Says, that Beelzebub[336] lurks in her kerchief so sly,
    And Apollyon[337] shoots darts from her merry black eye;
    Yet whoop, Jack!kiss Gillian the quicker,
    Till she bloom like a rose, and a fig for the vicar!Our vicar thus preaches--and why should he not?For the dues of his cure are the placket and pot;[338]
    And 'tis right of his office poor laymen to lurch,
    Who infringe the domains of our good Mother Church.off with your liquor,
    Sweet Marjorie's the word, and a fig for the vicar![335] "Upsees out," i.e., in the Dutch fashion, or deeply.[338] "Placket and pot," i.e., women and wine.The warder's challenge, heard without,
    Stayed in mid-roar the merry shout.A soldier to the portal went,--
    "Here is old Bertram, sirs, of Ghent;
    And,--beat for jubilee the drum!--
    A maid and minstrel with him come."Bertram, a Fleming, gray and scarr'd,
    Was entering now the Court of Guard,
    A harper with him, and in plaid
    All muffled close, a mountain maid,
    Who backward shrunk to'scape the view
    Of the loose scene and boisterous crew.they roar'd.--"I only know,
    From noon till eve we fought with foe
    As wild and as untamable
    As the rude mountains where they dwell;
    On both sides store of blood is lost,
    Nor much success can either boast."--
    "But whence thy captives, friend?such spoil
    As theirs must needs reward thy toil.Old dost thou wax, and wars grow sharp;
    Thou now hast glee-maiden and harp!Get thee an ape, and trudge the land,
    The leader of a juggler band.""No, comrade;--no such fortune mine.After the fight, these sought our line,
    That aged Harper and the girl,
    And, having audience of the Earl,
    Mar bade I should purvey them steed,
    And bring them hitherward with speed.Forbear your mirth and rude alarm,
    For none shall do them shame or harm."--
    "Hear ye his boast?"cried John of Brent,
    Ever to strife and jangling bent;
    "Shall he strike doe beside our lodge,
    And yet the jealous niggard grudge
    To pay the forester his fee?I'll have my share, howe'er it be,
    Despite of Moray, Mar, or thee."Bertram his forward step withstood;
    And, burning in his vengeful mood,
    Old Allan, though unfit for strife,
    Laid hand upon his dagger knife;
    But Ellen boldly stepp'd between,
    And dropp'd at once the tartan screen:--
    So, from his morning cloud, appears
    The sun of May, through summer tears.The savage soldiery, amazed,
    As on descended angel gazed;
    Even hardy Brent, abash'd and tamed,
    Stood half admiring, half ashamed.Boldly she spoke,--"Soldiers, attend!My father was the soldier's friend;
    Cheer'd him in camps, in marches led,
    And with him in the battle bled.Not from the valiant, or the strong,
    Should exile's daughter suffer wrong."--
    Answer'd De Brent, most forward still
    In every feat or good or ill,--
    "I shame me of the part I play'd;
    And thou an outlaw's child, poor maid!An outlaw I by forest laws,
    And merry Needwood[339] knows the cause.Poor Rose,--if Rose be living now,"--
    He wiped his iron eye and brow,--
    "Must bear such age, I think, as thou.--
    Hear ye, my mates;--I go to call
    The Captain of our watch to hall:
    There lies my halberd on the floor;
    And he that steps my halberd o'er,
    To do the maid injurious part,
    My shaft shall quiver in his heart!--
    Beware loose speech, or jesting rough:
    Ye all know John de Brent.[339] A royal forest in Staffordshire.Their Captain came, a gallant young,--
    Of Tullibardine's[340] house he sprung,--
    Nor wore he yet the spurs of knight;
    Gay was his mien, his humor light,
    And, though by courtesy controll'd,
    Forward his speech, his bearing bold.The high-born maiden ill could brook
    The scanning of his curious look
    And dauntless eye;--and yet, in sooth,
    Young Lewis was a generous youth;
    But Ellen's lovely face and mien,
    Ill suited to the garb and scene,
    Might lightly bear construction strange,
    And give loose fancy scope to range."Welcome to Stirling towers, fair maid!Come ye to seek a champion's aid,
    On palfrey white, with harper hoar,
    Like errant damosel[341] of yore?Does thy high quest[342] a knight require,
    Or may the venture suit a squire?"--
    Her dark eye flash'd;--she paused and sigh'd,--
    "Oh, what have I to do with pride!--
    Through scenes of sorrow, shame, and strife,
    A suppliant for a father's life,
    I crave an audience of the King.Behold, to back my suit, a ring,
    The royal pledge of grateful claims,
    Given by the Monarch to Fitz-James."[340] Tullibardine was an old seat of the Murrays in Perthshire.[341] In the days of chivalry any oppressed "damosel" could obtain
redress by applying to the court of the nearest king, where some knight
became her champion.X.

    The signet ring young Lewis took,
    With deep respect and alter'd look;
    And said,--"This ring our duties own;
    And pardon, if to worth unknown,
    In semblance mean, obscurely veil'd,
    Lady, in aught my folly fail'd.Soon as the day flings wide his gates,
    The King shall know what suitor waits.Please you, meanwhile, in fitting bower
    Repose you till his waking hour;
    Female attendance shall obey
    Your hest, for service or array.But, ere she followed, with the grace
    And open bounty of her race,
    She bade her slender purse be shared
    Among the soldiers of the guard.The rest with thanks their guerdon took;
    But Brent, with shy and awkward look,
    On the reluctant maiden's hold
    Forced bluntly back the proffer'd gold;--
    "Forgive a haughty English heart,
    And oh, forget its ruder part!The vacant purse shall be my share,
    Which in my barret cap I'll bear,
    Perchance, in jeopardy of war,
    Where gayer crests may keep afar."With thanks--'twas all she could--the maid
    His rugged courtesy repaid.When Ellen forth with Lewis went,
    Allan made suit to John of Brent:--
    "My lady safe, oh, let your grace
    Give me to see my master's face!His minstrel I,--to share his doom
    Bound from the cradle to the tomb.Tenth in descent, since first my sires
    Waked for his noble house their lyres,
    Nor one of all the race was known
    But prized its weal above their own.With the Chief's birth begins our care;
    Our harp must soothe the infant heir,
    Teach the youth tales of fight, and grace
    His earliest feat of field or chase;
    In peace, in war, our rank we keep,
    We cheer his board, we soothe his sleep,
    Nor leave him till we pour our verse--
    A doleful tribute!--o'er his hearse.Then let me share his captive lot;
    It is my right--deny it not!"--
    "Little we reck," said John of Brent,
    "We Southern men, of long descent;
    Nor wot we how a name--a word--
    Makes clansmen vassals to a lord:
    Yet kind my noble landlord's part,--
    God bless the house of Beaudesert!And, but I loved to drive the deer,
    More than to guide the laboring steer,
    I had not dwelt an outcast here.Come, good old Minstrel, follow me;
    Thy Lord and Chieftain shalt thou see."Then, from a rusted iron hook,
    A bunch of ponderous keys he took,
    Lighted a torch, and Allan led
    Through grated arch and passage dread.Portals they pass'd, where, deep within,
    Spoke prisoner's moan, and fetters' din;
    Through rugged vaults, where, loosely stored,
    Lay wheel, and ax, and headsman's sword,
    And many an hideous engine grim,
    For wrenching joint, and crushing limb,
    By artist form'd, who deemed it shame
    And sin to give their work a name.They halted at a low-brow'd porch,
    And Brent to Allan gave the torch,
    While bolt and chain he backward roll'd,
    And made the bar unhasp its hold.They enter'd:--'twas a prison room
    Of stern security and gloom,
    Yet not a dungeon; for the day
    Through lofty gratings found its way,
    And rude and antique garniture
    Deck'd the sad walls and oaken floor;
    Such as the rugged days of old
    Deem'd fit for captive noble's hold.[343]
    "Here," said De Brent, "thou mayst remain
    Till the Leech[344] visit him again.Strict is his charge, the warders tell,
    To tend the noble prisoner well."Retiring then, the bolt he drew,
    And the lock's murmurs growl'd anew.Roused at the sound, from lowly bed
    A captive feebly raised his head;
    The wondering Minstrel look'd, and knew--
    Not his dear lord, but Roderick Dhu!For, come from where Clan-Alpine fought,
    They, erring, deem'd the Chief he sought.As the tall ship, whose lofty prore[345]
    Shall never stem the billows more,
    Deserted by her gallant band,
    Amid the breakers lies astrand,[346]
    So, on his couch, lay Roderick Dhu!And oft his fever'd limbs he threw
    In toss abrupt, as when her sides
    Lie rocking in the advancing tides,
    That shake her frame with ceaseless beat,
    Yet cannot heave her from the seat;--
    Oh, how unlike her course on sea!Or his free step on hill and lea!--
    Soon as the Minstrel he could scan,
    "What of thy lady?--of my clan?--
    My mother?--Douglas?--tell me all.Yet speak,--speak boldly,--do not fear."--
    (For Allan, who his mood well knew,
    Was choked with grief and terror too.)"Who fought--who fled?--Old man, be brief;--
    Some might--for they had lost their Chief.Who basely live?--who bravely died?"--
    "Oh, calm thee, Chief!"the Minstrel cried;
    "Ellen is safe;"--"For that, thank Heaven!"--
    "And hopes are for the Douglas given;--
    The lady Margaret, too, is well;
    And, for thy clan,--on field or fell,
    Has never harp of minstrel told
    Of combat fought so true and bold.Thy stately Pine is yet unbent,
    Though many a goodly bough is rent."The Chieftain rear'd his form on high,
    And fever's fire was in his eye;
    But ghastly, pale, and livid streaks
    Checker'd his swarthy brow and cheeks.I have heard thee play,
    With measure bold, on festal day,
    In yon lone isle,... again where ne'er
    Shall harper play, or warrior hear!That stirring air that peals on high,
    O'er Dermid's[347] race our victory.--
    Strike it!--and then, (for well thou canst,)
    Free from thy minstrel spirit glanced,
    Fling me the picture of the fight,
    When met my clan the Saxon might.I'll listen, till my fancy hears
    The clang of swords, the crash of spears!These grates, these walls, shall vanish then,
    For the fair field of fighting men,
    And my free spirit burst away,
    As if it soar'd from battle fray."The trembling Bard with awe obey'd,--
    Slow on the harp his hand he laid;
    But soon remembrance of the sight
    He witness'd from the mountain's height,
    With what old Bertram told at night,
    Awaken'd the full power of song,
    And bore him in career along;--
    As shallop launch'd on river's tide,
    That slow and fearful leaves the side,
    But, when it feels the middle stream,
    Drives downward swift as lightning's beam.The Clan-Alpine, or the MacGregors, and the
Campbells, were hereditary enemies.BATTLE OF BEAL' AN DUINE."The Minstrel came once more to view
    The eastern ridge of Benvenue,
    For ere he parted, he would say
    Farewell to lovely Loch Achray--
    Where shall he find, in foreign land,
    So lone a lake, so sweet a strand!There is no breeze upon the fern,
        Nor ripple on the lake,
      Upon her eyry nods the erne,[348]
        The deer has sought the brake;
      The small birds will not sing aloud,
        The springing trout lies still,
      So darkly glooms yon thunder cloud,
      That swathes, as with a purple shroud,
        Benledi's distant hill.Is it the thunder's solemn sound
        That mutters deep and dread,
      Or echoes from the groaning ground
        The warrior's measured tread?Is it the lightning's quivering glance
        That on the thicket streams,
      Or do they flash on spear and lance
        The sun's retiring beams?I see the dagger crest of Mar,
    I see the Moray's silver star,
    Wave o'er the cloud of Saxon war,
    That up the lake comes winding far!To hero bound for battle strife,
        Or bard of martial lay,
      'Twere worth ten years of peaceful life,
        One glance at their array!"[348] The sea eagle or osprey."Their light arm'd archers far and near
        Survey'd the tangled ground;
      Their center ranks, with pike and spear,
        A twilight forest frown'd;
      Their barbed[349] horsemen, in the rear,
        The stern battalia[350] crown'd.No cymbal clash'd, no clarion rang,
        Still were the pipe and drum;
      Save heavy tread, and armor's clang,
        The sullen march was dumb.There breathed no wind their crests to shake,
        Or wave their flags abroad;
      Scarce the frail aspen seem'd to quake,
        That shadow'd o'er their road.Their vaward[351] scouts no tidings bring,
        Can rouse no lurking foe,
      Nor spy a trace of living thing,
        Save when they stirr'd the roe;
      The host moves like a deep-sea wave,
      Where rise no rocks its pride to brave,
        High swelling, dark, and slow.The lake is pass'd, and now they gain
    A narrow and a broken plain,
    Before the Trosachs' rugged jaws;
    And here the horse and spearmen pause.While, to explore the dangerous glen,
    Dive through the pass the archer men.""At once there rose so wild a yell
    Within that dark and narrow dell,
    As all the fiends, from heaven that fell,
    Had peal'd the banner cry of hell!Forth from the pass in tumult driven,
      Like chaff before the wind of heaven,
        The archery appear;
      For life!their plight they ply--
      And shriek, and shout, and battle cry,
      And plaids and bonnets waving high,
      And broadswords flashing to the sky,
        Are maddening in the rear.Onward they drive, in dreadful race,
        Pursuers and pursued;
      Before that tide of flight and chase,
      How shall it keep its rooted place,
        The spearmen's twilight wood?--
      'Down, down,' cried Mar, 'your lances down!--
      Like reeds before the tempest's frown,
      That serried grove of lances brown
        At once lay level'd low;
      And closely shouldering side to side,
      The bristling ranks the onset bide.--
      'We'll quell the savage mountaineer,
        As their Tinchel[352] cows the game!They come as fleet as forest deer,
        We'll drive them back as tame.'"--

[352] A circle of sportsmen surrounding a large space, which was
gradually narrowed till the game it inclosed was brought within reach."Bearing before them, in their course,
    The relics of the archer force,
    Like wave with crest of sparkling foam,
    Right onward did Clan-Alpine come.Above the tide, each broadsword bright
      Was brandishing like beam of light,
        Each targe was dark below;
      And with the ocean's mighty swing,
      When heaving to the tempest's wing,
        They hurl'd them on the foe.I heard the lance's shivering crash,
    As when the whirlwind rends the ash;
    I heard the broadsword's deadly clang,
    As if an hundred anvils rang!But Moray wheel'd his rearward rank
    Of horsemen on Clan-Alpine's flank,
        --'My banner man, advance!I see,' he cried, 'their column shake.--
      Now, gallants!for your ladies' sake,
        Upon them with the lance!'--
      The horsemen dash'd among the rout,
        As deer break through the broom;
      Their steeds are stout, their swords are out,
        They soon make lightsome room.Clan-Alpine's best are backward borne--
        Where, where was Roderick then?One blast upon his bugle horn
        Were worth a thousand men.And refluent[353] through the pass of fear
        The battle's tide was pour'd;
      Vanish'd the Saxon's struggling spear,
        Vanish'd the mountain sword.As Bracklinn's chasm, so black and steep,
        Receives her roaring linn,
      As the dark caverns of the deep
        Suck the dark whirlpool in,
    So did the deep and darksome pass
    Devour the battle's mingled mass:
    None linger now upon the plain,
    Save those who ne'er shall fight again.""Now westward rolls the battle's din,
    That deep and doubling pass within.the work of fate
    Is bearing on: its issue wait,
    Where the rude Trosachs' dread defile
    Opens on Katrine's lake and isle.Gray Benvenue I soon repass'd,
    Loch Katrine lay beneath me cast.The sun is set;--the clouds are met,
          The lowering scowl of heaven
      An inky hue of livid blue
          To the deep lake has given;
    Strange gusts of wind from mountain glen
    Swept o'er the lake, then sunk agen.I heeded not the eddying surge,
    Mine eye but saw the Trosachs' gorge,
    Mine ear but heard that sullen sound,
    Which like an earthquake shook the ground,
    And spoke the stern and desperate strife
    That parts not but with parting life,
    Seeming, to minstrel ear, to toll
    The dirge of many a passing soul.Nearer it comes--the dim-wood glen
      The martial flood disgorged agen,
          But not in mingled tide;
      The plaided warriors of the North
      High on the mountain thunder forth
          And overhang its side;
      While by the lake below appears
      The dark'ning cloud of Saxon spears.At weary bay each shatter'd band,
      Eying their foemen, sternly stand;
      Their banners stream like tatter'd sail,
      That flings its fragments to the gale,
      And broken arms and disarray
      Mark'd the fell havoc of the day.""Viewing the mountain's ridge askance,
    The Saxon stood in sullen trance,
    Till Moray pointed with his lance,
        And cried--'Behold yon isle!--
    See!none are left to guard its strand,
    But women weak, that wring the hand:
    'Tis there of yore the robber band
        Their booty wont to pile;--
    My purse, with bonnet pieces[354] store,
    To him will swim a bowshot o'er,
    And loose a shallop from the shore.Lightly we'll tame the war wolf then,
    Lords of his mate, and brood, and den.'--
    Forth from the ranks a spearman sprung,
    On earth his casque and corselet rung,
        He plunged him in the wave:--
    All saw the deed--the purpose knew,
    And to their clamors Benvenue
        A mingled echo gave;
    The Saxons shout, their mate to cheer,
    The helpless females scream for fear,
    And yells for rage the mountaineer.'Twas then, as by the outcry riven,
    Pour'd down at once the lowering heaven;
    A whirlwind swept Loch Katrine's breast,
    Her billows rear'd their snowy crest.Well for the swimmer swell'd they high,
    To mar the Highland marksman's eye;
    For round him shower'd,'mid rain and hail,
    The vengeful arrows of the Gael.--
    In vain--He nears the isle--and lo!His hand is on a shallop's bow.--Just then a flash of lightning came,
    It tinged the waves and strand with flame;--
    I mark'd Duncraggan's widow'd dame--
    Behind an oak I saw her stand,
    A naked dirk gleam'd in her hand:
    It darken'd,--but, amid the moan
    Of waves, I heard a dying groan;
    Another flash!--the spearman floats
    A weltering corse beside the boats,
    And the stern matron o'er him stood,
    Her hand and dagger streaming blood."[354] A bonnet piece is an elegant gold coin, bearing on one side the
head of James V. wearing a bonnet.the Saxons cried--
    The Gael's exulting shout replied.Despite the elemental rage,
    Again they hurried to engage;
    But, ere they closed in desperate fight,
    Bloody with spurring came a knight,
    Sprung from his horse, and, from a crag,
    Waved 'twixt the hosts a milk-white flag.Clarion and trumpet by his side
    Rung forth a truce note high and wide,
    While, in the Monarch's name, afar
    An herald's voice forbade the war,
    For Bothwell's lord, and Roderick bold,
    Were both, he said, in captive hold."--But here the lay made sudden stand,
    The harp escaped the Minstrel's hand!--
    Oft had he stolen a glance, to spy
    How Roderick brook'd his minstrelsy:
    At first, the Chieftain, to the chime,
    With lifted hand, kept feeble time;
    That motion ceased,--yet feeling strong
    Varied his look as changed the song;
    At length, no more his deafen'd ear
    The minstrel melody can hear;
    His face grows sharp,--his hands are clench'd,
    As if some pang his heartstrings wrench'd;
    Set are his teeth, his fading eye
    Is sternly fix'd on vacancy;
    Thus, motionless, and moanless, drew
    His parting breath, stout Roderick Dhu!--
    Old Allan-Bane look'd on aghast,
    While grim and still his spirit pass'd:
    But when he saw that life was fled,
    He pour'd his wailing o'er the dead."And art them cold and lowly laid,
    Thy foeman's dread, thy people's aid,
    Breadalbane's[355] boast, Clan-Alpine's shade!For thee shall none a requiem say?--
    For thee,--who loved the Minstrel's lay,
    For thee, of Bothwell's house the stay,
    The shelter of her exiled line?E'en in this prison house of thine,
    I'll wail for Alpine's honor'd Pine!"What groans shall yonder valleys fill!What shrieks of grief shall rend yon hill!What tears of burning rage shall thrill,
    When mourns thy tribe thy battles done,
    Thy fall before the race was won,
    Thy sword ungirt ere set of sun!There breathes not clansman of thy line,
    But would have given his life for thine.--
    Oh, woe for Alpine's honor'd Pine!"Sad was thy lot on mortal stage!--
    The captive thrush may brook the cage,
    The prison'd eagle dies for rage.And, when its notes awake again,
    Even she, so long beloved in vain,
    Shall with my harp her voice combine,
    And mix her woe and tears with mine,
    To wail Clan-Alpine's honor'd Pine."--

[355] The region bordering Loch Tay.Ellen, the while, with bursting heart,
    Remain'd in lordly bower apart,
    Where play'd, with many- gleams,
    Through storied[356] pane the rising beams.In vain on gilded roof they fall,
    And lighten'd up a tapestried wall,
    And for her use a menial train
    A rich collation spread in vain.The banquet proud, the chamber gay,
    Scarce drew one curious glance astray;
    Or if she look'd, 'twas but to say,
    With better omen dawn'd the day
    In that lone isle, where waved on high
    The dun deer's hide for canopy;
    Where oft her noble father shared
    The simple meal her care prepared,
    While Lufra, crouching by her side,
    Her station claim'd with jealous pride,
    And Douglas, bent on woodland game,
    Spoke of the chase to Malcolm Graeme,
    Whose answer, oft at random made,
    The wandering of his thoughts betray'd.--
    Those who such simple joys have known,
    Are taught to prize them when they're gone.But sudden, see, she lifts her head!What distant music has the power
    To win her in this woeful hour!'Twas from a turret that o'erhung
    Her latticed bower, the strain was sung.[356] Stained or painted to form pictures illustrating history.LAY OF THE IMPRISONED HUNTSMAN."My hawk is tired of perch and hood,
    My idle greyhound loathes his food,
    My horse is weary of his stall,
    And I am sick of captive thrall.I wish I were, as I have been,
    Hunting the hart in forest green,
    With bended bow and bloodhound free,
    For that's the life is meet for me."I hate to learn the ebb of time,
    From yon dull steeple's drowsy chime,
    Or mark it as the sunbeams crawl,
    Inch after inch, along the wall.The lark was wont my matins ring,
    The sable rook my vespers sing;
    These towers, although a king's they be,
    Have not a hall of joy for me."No more at dawning morn I rise,
    And sun myself in Ellen's eyes,
    Drive the fleet deer the forest through,
    And homeward wend with evening dew;
    A blithesome welcome blithely meet,
    And lay my trophies at her feet,
    While fled the eve on wing of glee,--
    That life is lost to love and me!"The heart-sick lay was hardly said,
    The list'ner had not turn'd her head,
    It trickled still, the starting tear,
    When light a footstep struck her ear,
    And Snowdoun's graceful Knight was near.She turn'd the hastier, lest again
    The prisoner should renew his strain."Oh, welcome, brave Fitz-James!"she said;
    "How may an almost orphan maid
    Pay the deep debt"--"Oh, say not so!the boon to give,
    And bid thy noble father live;
    I can but be thy guide, sweet maid,
    With Scotland's King thy suit to aid.No tyrant he, though ire and pride
    May lay his better mood aside.'tis more than time--
    He holds his court at morning prime."With beating heart, and bosom wrung,
    As to a brother's arm she clung.Gently he dried the falling tear,
    And gently whisper'd hope and cheer;
    Her faltering steps half led, half stayed,[357]
    Through gallery fair and high arcade,
    Till, at his touch, its wings of pride
    A portal arch unfolded wide.Within 'twas brilliant all and light,
    A thronging scene of figures bright;
    It glow'd on Ellen's dazzled sight,
    As when the setting sun has given
    Ten thousand hues to summer even,
    And from their tissue, fancy frames
    Aerial[358] knights and fairy dames.Still by Fitz-James her footing staid;
    A few faint steps she forward made,
    Then slow her drooping head she raised,
    And fearful round the presence[359] gazed;
    For him she sought, who own'd this state,
    The dreaded Prince, whose will was fate!--
    She gazed on many a princely port,
    Might well have ruled a royal court;
    On many a splendid garb she gazed,
    Then turn'd bewilder'd and amazed,
    For all stood bare; and, in the room,
    Fitz-James alone wore cap and plume.To him each lady's look was lent;
    On him each courtier's eye was bent;
    Midst furs, and silks, and jewels sheen,
    He stood, in simple Lincoln green,
    The center of the glittering ring,--
    And Snowdoun's Knight[360] is Scotland's King.[360] James V. was accustomed to make personal investigation of the
condition of his people.The name he generally assumed when in disguise
was "Laird of Ballingeich."As wreath of snow, on mountain breast,
    Slides from the rock that gave it rest,
    Poor Ellen glided from her stay,
    And at the Monarch's feet she lay;
    No word her choking voice commands,--
    She show'd the ring--she clasp'd her hands.not a moment could he brook,
    The generous Prince, that suppliant look!Gently he raised her; and, the while,
    Check'd with a glance the circle's smile;
    Graceful, but grave, her brow he kiss'd,
    And bade her terrors be dismiss'd:--
    "Yes, Fair; the wandering poor Fitz-James
    The fealty of Scotland claims.To him thy woes, thy wishes, bring;
    He will redeem his signet ring.Ask naught for Douglas; yestereven,
    His Prince and he have much forgiven:
    Wrong hath he had from slanderous tongue--
    I, from his rebel kinsmen, wrong.We would not, to the vulgar crowd,
    Yield what they craved with clamor loud;
    Calmly we heard and judged his cause,
    Our council aided, and our laws.I stanch'd thy father's death-feud stern
    With stout De Vaux and gray Glencairn;
    And Bothwell's Lord henceforth we own
    The friend and bulwark of our Throne.--
    But, lovely infidel, how now?Lord James of Douglas, lend thine aid;
    Thou must confirm this doubting maid."Then forth the noble Douglas sprung,
    And on his neck his daughter hung.The Monarch drank, that happy hour,
    The sweetest, holiest draught of Power,--
    When it can say, with godlike voice,
    Arise, sad Virtue, and rejoice!Yet would not James the general eye
    On Nature's raptures long should pry;
    He stepp'd between--"Nay, Douglas, nay,
    Steal not my proselyte away!The riddle 'tis my right to read,
    That brought this happy chance to speed.[361]
    Yes, Ellen, when disguised I stray
    In life's more low but happier way,
    'Tis under name which veils my power;
    Nor falsely veils--for Stirling's tower
    Of yore the name of Snowdoun claims,
    And Normans call me James Fitz-James.Thus watch I o'er insulted laws,
    Thus learn to right the injured cause."--
    Then, in a tone apart and low,--
    "Ah, little traitress!none must know
    What idle dream, what lighter thought,
    What vanity full dearly bought,
    Join'd to thine eye's dark witchcraft, drew
    My spellbound steps to Benvenue,
    In dangerous hour, and all but gave
    Thy Monarch's life to mountain glaive!"--
    Aloud he spoke,--"Thou still dost hold
    That little talisman of gold,
    Pledge of my faith, Fitz-James's ring--
    What seeks fair Ellen of the King?"Full well the conscious maiden guess'd
    He probed the weakness of her breast;
    But, with that consciousness, there came
    A lightening of her fears for Graeme,
    And more she deem'd the Monarch's ire
    Kindled 'gainst him, who, for her sire,
    Rebellious broadsword boldly drew;
    And, to her generous feeling true,
    She craved the grace of Roderick Dhu."Forbear thy suit:--the King of kings
    Alone can stay life's parting wings.I know his heart, I know his hand,
    Have shared his cheer, and proved his brand;--
    My fairest earldom would I give
    To bid Clan-Alpine's Chieftain live!--
    Hast thou no other boon to crave?Blushing, she turn'd her from the King,
    And to the Douglas gave the ring,
    As if she wish'd her sire to speak
    The suit that stain'd her glowing cheek.--
    "Nay, then, my pledge has lost its force,
    And stubborn Justice holds her course.--
    Malcolm, come forth!"--and, at the word,
    Down kneel'd the Graeme to Scotland's Lord."For thee, rash youth, no suppliant sues,
    From thee may Vengeance claim her dues,
    Who, nurtured underneath our smile,
    Hast paid our care by treacherous wile,
    And sought, amid thy faithful clan,
    A refuge for an outlaw'd man,
    Dishonoring thus thy loyal name.--
    Fetters and warder for the Graeme!"--
    His chain of gold the King unstrung,
    The links o'er Malcolm's neck he flung,
    Then gently drew the glittering band,
    And laid the clasp on Ellen's hand.The hills grow dark,
      On purple peaks a deeper shade descending;
    In twilight copse the glowworm lights her spark,
      The deer, half seen, are to the covert wending.the fountain lending,
      And the wild breeze, thy wilder minstrelsy;
    Thy numbers sweet with Nature's vespers blending,
      With distant echo from the fold and lea,
    And herd-boy's evening pipe, and hum of housing[362] bee.Yet, once again, farewell, thou Minstrel Harp!Yet, once again, forgive my feeble sway!And little reck I of the censure sharp
      May idly cavil at an idle lay.Much have I owed thy strains on life's long way,
      Through secret woes the world has never known,
    When on the weary night dawn'd wearier day,
      And bitterer was the grief devour'd alone.That I o'erlived such woes, Enchantress!as my lingering footsteps slow retire,
      Some Spirit of the Air has waked thy string!'Tis now a seraph bold, with touch of fire--
      'Tis now the brush of Fairy's frolic wing.Receding now, the dying numbers ring
      Fainter and fainter down the rugged dell,
    And now the mountain breezes scarcely bring
      A wandering witch note of the distant spell--
    And now, 'tis silent all!--Enchantress, fare thee well!A series of arches supported by columns or piers, either open
or backed by masonry.A kind of cap or head gear formerly worn by soldiers.A wall or rampart around the top of a castle, with openings
to look through and annoy the enemy.A capacious drinking cup or can formerly made of waxed
leather.A person knighted on some other ground than that of
military service; a knight who has not known the hardships of war.To grapple; to come to close quarters in fight.A kind of cap worn by Scottish matrons.The plume or decoration on the top of a helmet.The ridge of the neck of a horse or dog.A bridge at the entrance of a castle, which, when lowered
by chains, gave access across the moat or ditch surrounding the
structure.Something which was bestowed as a token of good will or of
love, as a glove or a knot of ribbon, to be worn habitually by a
knight-errant.A seeming aim at one part when it is
intended to strike another.Pertaining to that political form in which there was a chain of
persons holding land of one another on condition of performing certain
services.Every man in the chain was bound to his immediate superior,
held land from him, took oath of allegiance to him, and became his man.A trumpet call; a fanfare or prelude by one or more trumpets
performed on the approach of any person of distinction.The front of a stag's head; the horns.A long-handled weapon armed with a steel point, and having a
crosspiece of steel with a cutting edge.An upper garment of leather, worn for defense by common soldiers.It was sometimes strengthened by small pieces of metal stitched into it."To give law" to a stag is to allow it a start of a certain
distance or time before the hounds are slipped, the object being to
insure a long chase.A cage for hawks while mewing or moulting: hence an inclosure, a
place of confinement.In the Roman Catholic Church the first canonical hour of prayer,
six o'clock in the morning, generally the first quarter of the day.A stout staff used as a weapon of defense.In using it,
one hand was placed in the middle, and the other halfway between the
middle and the end.A ring containing a signet or private seal.To let slip; to loose hands from the noose; to be sent in pursuit
of game.A cup of wine drunk on parting from a friend on horseback.A valley of considerable size, through which a river flows.An officer of the forest, who had the nocturnal care of vert
and venison.A song the parts of which are sung in succession; a round.To sing in the manner of a catch or round, also in a full, jovial voice.The skin of the squirrel, much used in the fourteenth century as
fur for garments.A guarding or defensive position or motion in fencing._The Lady of the Lake_ is usually read in the first year of the high
school course, and it is with this fact in mind that the following
suggestions have been made.It is an excellent book with which to begin
the study of the ordinary forms of poetry, of plot structure, and the
simpler problems of description.For this reason in the exercises that
follow the emphasis has been placed on these topics._The Lady of the Lake_ is an excellent example of the minor epic.Corresponding to the "Arms and the man I sing," of the AEneid, and the
invocation to the Muse, are the statement of the theme, "Knighthood's
dauntless deed and Beauty's matchless eye," and the invocation to the
Harp of the North, in the opening stanzas.For the heroes, descendants
of the gods, of the great epic, we have a king, the chieftain of a
great clan, an outlaw earl and his daughter, characters less elevated
than those of the great epic, but still important.The element of the
supernatural brought in by the gods and goddesses of the epic is here
supplied by the minstrel, Brian the priest, and the harp.The interest
of the poem lies in the incidents as with the epic.The romantic story
of Ellen and Malcolm, however, lies quite outside the realm of the
great epic, which is concerned with the fate of a state or body of
people rather than with that of an individual.There are two threads to the story, one concerned with the love story
of Ellen and Malcolm, the main plot; and one with Roderick and his clan
against the King, the minor plot.The connection between them is very
slight, the story of Ellen could have been told almost without the
other, but the struggle of the Clan makes a fine background for the
love story of Ellen and Malcolm.The plot is an excellent one for the
beginner to study as the structure is so evident.The following is a
simple outline of the main incidents of the story.The coming of the stranger, later supposed by Roderick to
      be a spy of the King.The return of Douglas, guided by Malcolm, an act which
      brings Malcolm under the displeasure of the King.Roderick's proposal for Ellen's hand in order to avert the
      danger threatening Ellen and Douglas because of the recognition
      of the latter by the King's men.The rejection of the proposal, leading to the withdrawal of
      Ellen and her father to Coir-Uriskin and the departure of
      Douglas to the court to save Roderick and Malcolm.The preparations for war made by Roderick, including the
      sending of the Fiery Cross, and the Taghairm.Ellen and Allan-Bane at Coir-Uriskin.Douglas on his way to give himself up.The triumph of Fitz-James over Roderick.The interest reawakened in the King by Douglas's prowess
      and generosity.The battle of Beal 'an Duine.All of Scott's works afford excellent models of description for the
beginner in this very difficult form of composition.He deals with
the problems of description in a simple and evident manner.In most
cases he begins his description with the point of view, and chooses
the details in accordance with that point of view.The principle of
order used in the arrangement of the details is usually easy to find
and follow, and the beauty of his contrasts, the vanity and vividness
of his diction can be in a measure appreciated even by boys and girls
in the first year of the high school.If properly taught a pupil must
leave the study of the poem with a new sense of the power of words.In his description of character Scott deals with the most simple and
elemental emotions and is therefore fairly easy to imitate.In the
special topics under each canto special emphasis has been laid upon
description because of the adaptability of _his_ description to the needs
of the student.SPECIAL STUDIES IN THE CANTOS.CANTO I.

TEACHERS' OUTLINES FOR STUDIES IN ENGLISH

Based on the Requirements for Admission to College

By GILBERT SYKES BLAKELY, A.M., Instructor in English in the Morris
High School, New York City.This little book is intended to present to teachers plans for the study
of the English texts required for admission to college.These Outlines
are full of inspiration and suggestion, and will be welcomed by every
live teacher who hitherto, in order to avoid ruts, has been obliged to
compare notes with other teachers, visit classes, and note methods.The volume aims not at a discussion of the principles of teaching, but
at an application of certain principles to the teaching of some of the
books most generally read in schools.¬∂ The references by page and line to the book under discussion are to
the texts of the Gateway Series; but the Outlines can be used with any
series of English classics.¬∂ Certain brief plans of study are developed for the general teaching
of the novel, narrative poetry, lyric poetry, the drama, and the
essay.The suggestions are those of a practical teacher, and follow a
definite scheme in each work to be studied.There are discussions of
methods, topics for compositions, and questions for review.The lists
of questions are by no means exhaustive, but those that are given are
suggestive and typical.¬∂ The appendix contains twenty examinations in English, for admission
to college, recently set by different colleges in both the East and the
West.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

fared forward with a light heart, by dale and by down, through moss and
through meadow.By-and-by she came to a fair high palace, built all of
marble and shining jasper, with smooth lawns about it, and sunny gardens
of roses and gillyflowers, from which the air blew so sweet that it was
a pleasure to breathe it.The princess stood still for a moment, to
taste the sweetness of this air, and to look her fill at so fair a spot;
and as she stood there, it chanced that the palace-gates opened, and the
young king rode out with his court, to go a-catching of nighthawks.Now when the king saw a right fair princess standing alone at his
palace-gate, her rich garments dusty and travel-stained, and two heavy
sacks hung upon her shoulders, he was filled with amazement; and leaping
from his steed, like the gallant knight that he was, he besought her to
tell him whence she came and whither she was going, and in what way he
might be of service to her.But the princess looked down at her little dusty shoes, and answered
never a word; for she had seen at the first glance how fair and goodly a
king this was, and she would not ask him the price of butter, nor
whether his grandmother had sold her mangle yet.But she thought in her
heart, "Now, I have never, in all my life, seen a man to whom I would so
willingly say, 'With all my heart!'The king marvelled much at her silence, and presently repeated his
questions, adding, "And what do you carry so carefully in those two
sacks, which seem over-heavy for your delicate shoulders?"Still holding her eyes downcast, the princess took a ruby from one bag,
and a sapphire from the other, and in silence handed them to the king,
for she willed that he should know she was no beggar, even though her
shoes were dusty.Thereat all the nobles were filled with amazement, for
no such gems had ever been seen in that country.But the king looked steadfastly at the princess, and said, "Rubies are
fine, and sapphires are fair; but, maiden, if I could but see those
eyes of yours, I warrant that the gems would look pale and dull beside
them."At that the princess raised her clear dark eyes, and looked at the king
and smiled; and the glance of her eyes pierced straight to his heart, so
that he fell on his knees and cried:

"Ah!sweet princess, now do I know that thou art the love for whom I
have waited so long, and whom I have sought through so many lands.Give
me thy white hand, and tell me, either by word or by sign, that thou
wilt be my queen and my bride!"And the princess, like a right royal maiden as she was, looked him
straight in the eyes, and giving him her little white hand, answered
bravely, "_With all my heart!_"




CHAPTER XII.NOW, if we had looked into the hermit's cave a few days after this, we
should have seen a very pleasant sight.The good old man was sitting up
on his narrow couch, with his lame leg on a stool before him.On another
stool sat our worthy friend Bruin, with a backgammon-board on his knees,
and the two were deep in the mysteries of Russian backgammon."Dear, dear, what luck you do have!""Yes," said the hermit, "this finishes the game and the rubber.But just
remember, my friend, how you beat me yesterday.I was gammoned over and
over again, with never a doublet to save me from ruin."yesterday was one
of my good days.And so to-day you have gammoned me back again.I
suppose that is why the game is called back-gammon, hey?""And how have you been in the habit of playing?""You spoke of playing last winter, you know.Whom did you play with, for
example?""With myself," said the hermit,--"the right hand against the left.I
taught my crow the game once, but it didn't work very well.He could not
lift the dice-box, and could only throw the dice by running against the
box, and upsetting it.This was apt to disarrange the pieces, you see;
and as he would not trust me to throw for him, we gave it up.""And what else did you do in the way
of amusement?""I read, chiefly," replied the old man."You see I have a good many
books, and they are all good ones, which will bear reading many times.""That is _one_ thing about you people that I
cannot understand,--the reading of books.Seems so senseless, you know,
when you can use your eyes for other things.But, tell me," he added,
"have you never thought of trying our way of passing the winter?It is
certainly much the best way, when one is alone.Choose a comfortable
place, like this, for example, curl yourself up in the warmest corner,
and there you are, with nothing to do but to sleep till spring comes
again.""I am afraid I could not do that," said the hermit with a smile."We are
made differently, you see.I cannot sleep more than a few hours at a
time, at any season of the year.""That makes
all the difference, you know.Have you ever _tried_ sucking your paw?"The hermit was forced to admit that he never had.well, you really must try it some day," said Bruin."There is
nothing like it, after all.I will confess to you," he
added in a low tone, and looking cautiously about to make sure that they
were alone, "that I have missed it sadly this winter.In most respects
this has been the happiest season of my life, and I have enjoyed it more
than I can tell you; but still there are times,--when I am tired, you
know, or the weather is dull, or <DW53> is a little trying, as he is
sometimes,--times when I feel as if I would give a great deal for a
quiet corner where I could suck my paw and sleep for a week or two.""Couldn't you manage it, somehow?"asked the hermit, sympathetically."<DW53> thinks the Madam
would not like it.He is very genteel, you know,--very genteel indeed,
<DW53> is; and he says it wouldn't be at all 'the thing' for me to suck
my paw anywhere about the place.I never know just what 'thing' he means
when he says that, but it's a favorite expression of his; and he
certainly knows a great deal about good manners.Besides," he added,
more cheerfully, "there is always plenty of work to do, and that is the
best thing to keep one awake.Baldhead, it is time for your
dinner, sir; and here am I sitting and talking, when I ought to be
warming your broth!"With these words the excellent bear arose, put away the backgammon
board, and proceeded to build up the fire, hang the kettle, and put the
broth on to warm, all as deftly as if he had been a cook all his life.He stirred and tasted, shook his head, tasted again, and then said,--

"You haven't the top of a young pine-tree anywhere about the house, I
suppose?It would give this broth such a nice flavor.""I don't generally keep a
large stock of such things on hand.But I fancy the broth will be very
good without it, to judge from the last I had.""Do you ever put frogs in your
broth?""Whole ones, you know, rolled in a batter,
just like dumplings?""_No!_" said the hermit, quickly and decidedly."I am quite sure I
should not like them, thank you,--though it was very kind of you to make
the suggestion!"he added, seeing that Bruin looked disappointed."You have no idea how nice they are," said the good bear, rather sadly."But you are so strange, you people!I never could induce Toto or Madam
to try them, either.I invented the soup myself,--at least the
frog-dumpling part of it,--and made it one day as a little surprise for
them.But when I told them what the dumplings were, Toto choked and
rolled on the floor, and Madam was quite ill at the very thought, though
she had not begun to eat her soup.So <DW53> and Cracker and I had it all
to ourselves, and uncommonly good it was.It's a pity for people to be
so prejudiced."The good hermit was choking a little himself, for some reason or other,
but he looked very grave when Bruin turned toward him for assent, and
said, "Quite so!"The broth being now ready, the bear proceeded to arrange a tray neatly,
and set it before his patient, who took up his wooden spoon and fell to
with right good-will.The good bear stood watching him with great
satisfaction; and it was really a pity that there was no one there to
watch the bear himself, for as he stood there with a clean cloth over
his arm, his head on one side, and his honest face beaming with pride
and pleasure, he was very well worth looking at.At this moment a sharp cry of terror was heard outside, then a quick
whirr of wings, and the next moment the wood-pigeon darted into the
cave, closely pursued by a large hawk.She was quite
exhausted, and with one more piteous cry she fell fainting at Bruin's
feet.In another instant the hawk would have pounced upon her, but that
instant never came for the winged marauder.Instead, something or
somebody pounced on _him_.A thick white covering enveloped him,
entangling his claws, binding down his wings, well-nigh stifling him.He
felt himself seized in an iron grasp and lifted bodily into the air,
while a deep, stern voice exclaimed,--

"Now, sir!have you anything to say for yourself, before I wring your
neck?"Then the covering was drawn back from his head, and he found himself
face to face with the great bear, whom he knew perfectly well by sight.But he was a bold fellow, too well used to danger to shrink from it,
even in so terrible a form as this; and his fierce yellow eyes met the
stern gaze of his captor without shrinking.repeated the bear, "before I wring your ugly
neck?"replied the hawk, sullenly, "wring away."This answer rather disconcerted our friend Bruin, who, as he sometimes
said sadly to himself, had "lost all taste for killing;" so he only
shook Master Hawk a little, and said,--

"Do you know of any reason why your neck should _not_ be wrung?"Are you
afraid, you great clumsy monster?""I'll soon show you whether I am afraid or not!""If _you_ had had
nothing to eat for a week, you'd have eaten her long before this, I'll
be bound!"Here Bruin began to rub his nose with his disengaged paw, and to look
helplessly about him, as he always did when disturbed in mind.he exclaimed, "you hawk, what do you mean by that?"It _is_ rather short," said Bruin; "but--yes!why, of course, _any one_
can dig, if he wants to.""Ask that old thing," said the hawk, nodding toward the hermit, "whether
_he_ ever dug with his beak; and it's twice as long as mine."replied Bruin, promptly; but then he faltered, for
it suddenly occurred to him that he had never seen either Toto or the
Madam dig with their noses; and it was with some hesitation that he
asked:

"Mr.but--a--have you ever tried digging for roots
in the ground--with your beak--I mean, nose?"The hermit looked up gravely, as he sat with Pigeon Pretty on his knee."No, my friend," he said with great seriousness, "I have never tried
it, and doubt if I could do it.I can dig with my hands, though," he
added, seeing the good bear look more and more puzzled."But you see this bird has no hands, though he
has very ugly claws; so that doesn't help-- Well!"he cried, breaking
off short, and once more addressing the hawk."I don't see anything for
it _but_ to wring your neck, do you?After all, it will keep you from
being hungry again."But here the soft voice of the wood-pigeon interposed.Bruin,
dear," cried the gentle bird."Give him something to eat, and let him
go.If he had eaten nothing for a week, I am sure he was not to blame
for pursuing the first eatable creature he saw.Remember," she added in
a lower tone, which only the bear could hear, "that before this winter,
any of us would have done the same."Bruin scratched his head helplessly; the hawk turned his yellow eyes on
Pigeon Pretty with a strange look, but said nothing.But now the hermit
saw that it was time for him to interfere."Pigeon Pretty," he said, "you are right, as usual.Bruin, my friend,
bring your prisoner here, and let him finish this excellent broth, into
which I have crumbled some bread.I will answer for Master Hawk's good
behavior, for the present at least," he added, "for I know that he comes
of an old and honorable family."In five minutes the hawk was sitting quietly on the
hermit's knee, sipping broth, pursuing the floating bits of bread in the
bowl, and submitting to have his soft black plumage stroked, with the
best grace in the world.On the good man's other knee sat Pigeon Pretty,
now quite recovered from her fright and fatigue, her soft eyes beaming
with pleasure; while Bruin squatted opposite them, looking from one to
the other, and assuring himself over and over again that Pigeon Pretty
was "a most astonishing bird!'pon my word, a _most_ astonishing bird!"His meal ended, the stranger wiped his beak politely on his feathers,
plumed himself, and thanked his hosts for their hospitality, with a
stately courtesy which contrasted strangely with his former sullen and
ferocious bearing.The fierce glare was gone from his eyes, which were,
however, still strangely bright; and with his glossy plumage smooth, and
his head held proudly erect, he really was a noble-looking bird."Long is it, indeed," he said, "since any one has spoken a kind word to
Ger-Falcon.It will not be forgotten, I assure you.We are a wild and
lawless family,--our beak against every one, and every one's claw
against us,--and yet, as you observed, Sir Baldhead, we are an old and
honorable race.for the brave, brave days of old, when my sires
were the honored companions of kings and princes!My grandfather seventy
times removed was served by an emperor, the obsequious monarch carrying
him every day on his own wrist to the hunting.He ate from a golden
dish, and wore a collar of gems about his neck.what would be
the feelings of that noble ancestor if he could see his descendant a
hunted outlaw, persecuted by the sons of those very men who once courted
and caressed him, and supporting a precarious existence by the ignoble
spoils of barn-yards and hen-roosts!"The hawk paused, overcome by these recollections of past glory, and the
good bear said kindly,--

"Dear!And how did this melancholy change come
about, pray?"replied the hawk, "ignoble fashion!The race of
men degenerated, and occupied themselves with less lofty sports than
hawking.My family, left to themselves, knew not what to do.They had
been trained to pursue, to overtake, to slay, through long generations;
they were unfitted for anything else.But when they began to lead this
life on their own account, man, always ungrateful, turned upon them, and
persecuted them for the very deeds which had once been the delight and
pride of his fickle race.So we fell from our high estate, lower and
lower, till the present representative of the Ger-Falcon is the poor
creature you behold before you."The hawk bowed in proud humility, and his hearers all felt, perhaps,
much more sorry for him than he deserved.The wood-pigeon was about to
ask something more about his famous ancestors, when a shadow darkened
the mouth of the cave, and Toto made his appearance, with the crow
perched on his shoulder.he cried in his fresh, cheery voice, "how are you
to-day, sir?And catching sight of the stranger, he stopped short, and looked at the
bear for an explanation.Ger-Falcon, Toto," said Bruin.Toto nodded, and the hawk made him a stately bow; but the two
looked distrustfully at each other, and neither seemed inclined to make
any advances.Bruin continued,--

"Mr.Falcon came here in a--well, not in a friendly way at all, I must
say.But he is in a very different frame of mind, now, and I trust there
will be no further trouble.""Do you ever change your name, sir?"asked Toto, abruptly, addressing
the hawk."I have
no reason to be ashamed of my name.""And yet I am tolerably sure that Mr.Ger-Falcon is no other than Mr.Chicken Hawkon, and that it was he who
tried to carry off my Black Spanish chickens yesterday morning."I was
starving, and the chickens presented themselves to me wholly in the
light of food.May I ask for what purpose you keep chickens, sir?""Why, we eat them when they grow up," said Toto; "but--"

"Ah, precisely!""But we don't steal other people's chickens," said the boy, "we eat our
own.""You eat the tame, confiding
creatures who feed from your hand, and stretch their necks trustfully to
meet their doom.I, on the contrary, when the pangs of hunger force me
to snatch a morsel of food to save me from starvation, snatch it from
strangers, not from my friends."Toto was about to make a hasty reply, but the bear, with a motion of his
paw, checked him, and said gravely to the hawk,--

"Come, come!Falcon, I cannot have any dispute of this kind.There
is some truth in what you say, and I have no doubt that emperors and
other disreputable people have had a large share in forming the bad
habits into which you and all your family have fallen.But those habits
must be changed, sir, if you intend to remain in this forest.You must
not meddle with Toto's chickens; you must not chase quiet and harmless
birds.You must, in short, become a respectable and law-abiding bird,
instead of a robber and a murderer.""But how am I to live, pray?I
can be'respectable,' as you call it, in summer; but in weather like
this--"

"That can be easily managed," said the kind hermit."You can stay with
me, Falcon.I shall soon be able to shift for myself, and I will gladly
undertake to feed you until the snow and frost are gone.You will be a
companion for my crow-- By the way, where is my crow?Surely he came in
with you, Toto?""He did," said Toto, "but he hopped off the moment we entered.Didn't
like the looks of the visitor, I fancy," he added in a low tone.Search was made, and finally the crow was discovered huddled together, a
disconsolate little bunch of black feathers, in the darkest corner of
the cave.cried Toto, who was the first to catch sight of him.Why are you rumpling and humping yourself up in that
absurd fashion?"asked the crow, opening one eye a very little way, and
lifting his head a fraction of an inch from the mass of feathers in
which it was buried."Good Toto, kind Toto, is he gone?I would not be
eaten to-day, Toto, if it could be avoided."If you mean the hawk," said Toto, "he is _not_ gone; and what is more,
he isn't going, for your master has asked him to stay the rest of the
winter.Bruin has bound him
over to keep the peace, and you must come out and make the best of it."The unhappy crow begged and protested, but all in vain.Toto caught him
up, laughing, and carried him to his master, who set him on his knee,
and smoothed his rumpled plumage kindly.The hawk, who was highly
gratified by the hermit's invitation, put on his most gracious manner,
and soon convinced the crow that he meant him no harm."A member of the ancient family of Corvus!""Contemporaries, and probably friends, of the early Falcons.Let us also
be friends, dear sir; and let the names of James Crow and Ger-Falcon go
down together to posterity."But now Bruin and Pigeon Pretty were eager to hear all the home news
from the cottage.They listened with breathless interest to Toto's
account of the attempted robbery, and of <DW53>'s noble "defence of the
castle," as the boy called it.Miss Mary also received her full share of
the credit, nor was the kettle excluded from honorable mention.When all
was told, Toto proceeded to unpack the basket he had brought, which
contained gingerbread, eggs, apples, and a large can of butter-milk
marked "For Bruin."Many were the joyous exclamations called forth by
this present of good cheer; and it seemed as if the old hermit could not
sufficiently express his gratitude to Toto and his good grandmother.cried the boy, half distressed by the oft-repeated thanks."If you only knew how we _like_ it!Besides,"
he added, "I want you to do something for _me_ now, Mr.Baldhead, so
that will turn the tables.A shower is coming up, and it is early yet,
so I need not go home for an hour.So, will you not tell us a story?We
are very fond of stories,--Bruin and Pigeon Pretty and I.""With all my heart, dear
lad!"I have not heard a fairy story
for a long time."said the hermit, after a moment's reflection."When I was a
boy like you, Toto, I lived in Ireland, the very home of the fairy-folk;
so I know more about them than most people, perhaps, and this is an
Irish fairy story that I am going to tell you."And settling himself comfortably on his moss-pillows, the hermit began
the story of--




CHAPTER XIII."'It's Green Men, it's Green Men,
        All in the wood together;
      And, oh!we're feared o' the Green Men
        In all the sweet May weather,'--


"ON'Y I'm _not_ feared o' thim mesilf!"said Eileen, breaking off her
song with a little merry laugh."Wouldn't I be plazed to meet wan o'
thim this day, in the wud!Sure, it 'ud be the lookiest day o' me
loife."She parted the boughs, and entered the deep wood, where she was to
gather <DW19>s for her mother.Holding up her blue apron carefully, the
little girl stepped lightly here and there, picking up the dry brown
sticks, and talking to herself all the while,--to keep herself company,
as she thought."Thin I makes a low curchy," she was saying, "loike that wan Mother made
to the lord's lady yistherday, and the Green Man he gi'es me a nod,
and--

"'What's yer name, me dear?'"'Eileen Macarthy, yer Honor's Riverence!'I mustn't say
'Riverence,' bekase he's not a priest, ava'.'Yer Honor's Grace' wud do
better."'And what wud ye loike for a prisint, Eily?'"And thin I'd say--lit me see!A big green grasshopper, caught be his leg
in a spider's wib.Wait a bit, poor crathur, oi'll lit ye free agin."Full of pity for the poor grasshopper, Eily stooped to lift it carefully
out of the treacherous net into which it had fallen.But what was her
amazement on perceiving that the creature was not a grasshopper, but a
tiny man, clad from head to foot in light green, and with a scarlet cap
on his head.The little fellow was hopelessly entangled in the net, from
which he made desperate efforts to free himself, but the silken strands
were quite strong enough to hold him prisoner.For a moment Eileen stood petrified with amazement, murmuring to
herself, "Howly Saint Bridget!Sure, I niver
thought I'd find wan really in loife!"but the next moment her kindness
of heart triumphed over her fear, and stooping once more she very gently
took the little man up between her thumb and finger, pulled away the
clinging web, and set him respectfully on the top of a large toadstool
which stood conveniently near.The little Green Man shook himself, dusted his jacket with his red cap,
and then looked up at Eileen with twinkling eyes."Ye have saved my life, and ye
shall not be the worse for it, if ye _did_ take me for a grasshopper."Eily was rather abashed at this, but the little man looked very kind; so
she plucked up her courage, and when he asked, "What is yer name, my
dear?"("jist for all the wurrld the way I thought of," she said to
herself) answered bravely, with a low courtesy, "Eileen Macarthy, yer
Honor's Riverence--Grace, I mane!"and then she added, "They calls me
Eily, most times, at home.""Well, Eily," said the Green Man, "I suppose ye know who I am?""A fairy, plaze yer Honor's Grace!""Sure, I've aften heerd av yer Honor's people, but I niver thought I'd
see wan of yez.It's rale plazed I am, sure enough.Manny's the time
Docthor O'Shaughnessy's tell't me there was no sich thing as yez; but I
niver belaved him, yer Honor!"said the Green Man, heartily, "that's very right.And now, Eily, alanna, I'm going to do ye a
fairy's turn before I go.Ye shall have yer wish of whatever ye like in
the world.Take a minute to think about it, and then make up yer mind."Her dreams had then come true; she was to
have a fairy wish!Eily had all the old fairy-stories at her tongue's end, for her
mother told her one every night as she sat at her spinning.Jack and the
Beanstalk, the Sleeping Beauty, the Seven Swans, the Elves that stole
Barney Maguire, the Brown Witch, and the Widdy Malone's Pig,--she knew
them all, and scores of others besides.Her mother always began the
stories with, "Wanst upon a time, and a very good time it was;" or,
"Long, long ago, whin King O'Toole was young, and the praties grew all
ready biled in the ground;" or, "Wan fine time, whin the fairies danced,
and not a poor man lived in Ireland."In this way, the fairies seemed
always to be thrown far back into a remote past, which had nothing in
common with the real work-a-day world in which Eily lived.But now--oh,
wonder of wonders!--now, here was a real fairy, alive and active, with
as full power of blessing or banning as if the days of King O'Toole had
come again,--and what was more, with good-will to grant to Eileen
Macarthy whatever in the wide world she might wish for!The child stood
quite still, with her hands clasped, thinking harder than she had ever
thought in all her life before; and the Green Man sat on the toadstool
and watched her, with eyes which twinkled with some amusement, but no
malice."Take yer time, my dear," he said, "take yer time!Ye'll not meet a
Green Man every day, so make the best o' your chance!"Suddenly Eily's face lighted up with a sudden inspiration.she
cried, "sure I have it, yer Riverence's Grace--Honor, I shud say!it's the di'monds and pearrls I'll have, iv ye plaze!"repeated the fairy, "what diamonds and pearls?You don't want them _all_, surely?""Och, no, yer Honor!""Only wan of aich to dhrop out o' me
mouth ivery time I shpake, loike the girrl in the sthory, ye know.Whiniver she opened her lips to shpake, a di'mond an' a pearrl o' the
richest beauty dhropped from her mouth.That's what I mane, plaze yer
Honor's Grace.wudn't it be beautiful, entirely?""Are ye _quite_ sure that
this is what you wish for most, Eileen?Don't decide hastily, or ye may
be sorry for it."cried Eileen, "what for wud I be sorry?Sure I'd be richer than
the Countess o' Kilmoggen hersilf, let alone the Queen, be the time I'd
talked for an hour.An' I _loove_ to talk!"she added softly, half to
herself."Well, Eily," he said, "ye shall
have yer own way.Eileen bent down, and he touched her lips three times with the scarlet
tassel of his cap.Now go home, Eileen Macarthy, and the good wishes of the Green Men go
with ye.Ye will have yer own wish fulfilled as soon as ye cross the
threshold of yer home."A day
may come when ye will wish with all yer heart to have the charm taken
away.If that ever happens, come to this same place with a sprig of
holly in yer hand.Strike this toadstool three times, and say,
'Slanegher Banegher, Skeen na Lane!'and
clapping his scarlet cap on his head, the little man leaped from the
toadstool, and instantly disappeared from sight among the ferns and
mosses.Eileen stood still for some time, lost in a dream of wonder and delight.Finally rousing herself, she gave a long, happy sigh, and hastily
filling her apron with sticks, turned her steps homeward.The sun was sinking low when she came in sight of the little cabin, at
the door of which her mother was standing, looking anxiously in every
direction."Is it yersilf, Eily?"cried the good woman in a tone of relief, as she
saw the child approaching.It's a wild
colleen y'are, to be sprankin' about o' this way, and it nearly sundown.Where have ye been, I'm askin' ye?"Eily held up her apronful of sticks with a beaming smile, but answered
never a word till she stood on the threshold of the cottage.("Sure I
might lose some," she had been saying to herself, "and that 'ud niver
do.")But as soon as she had entered the little room which was kitchen,
hall, dining-room, and drawing-room for the Macarthy family, she dropped
her bundle of <DW19>s, and clasping her hands together, cried, "Och,
mother!Sure ye'll niver belave me whin I till ye--"

Here she suddenly stopped, for hop!two round shining things
dropped from her mouth, and rolled away over the floor of the cabin.[marbles]" shouted little Phelim, jumping up from his
seat by the fire and running to pick up the shining objects."Eily's
got her mouf full o' marvels!"Wait till I till ye,
mother asthore!I wint to the forest as ye bade me, to gather shticks,
an'--" hop!out flew two more shining things from her mouth and
rolled away after the others.Macarthy uttered a piercing shriek, and clapped her hand over
Eileen's mouth."Me choild's bewitched,
an' shpakin' buttons!Run,
Phelim," she added, "an' call yer father.He's in the praty-patch,
loikely.she said to Eily, who was struggling
vainly to free herself from her mother's powerful grasp."Kape shtill,
I'm tillin' ye, an' don't open yer lips!It's savin' yer body an' sowl I
may be this minute.Saint Bridget, Saint Michael, an' blissid Saint
Patrick!"she ejaculated piously, "save me choild, an' I'll serve ye on
me knees the rist o' me days."This was a sad beginning of all her glory.She tried
desperately to open her mouth, sure that in a moment she could make her
mother understand the whole matter.But Honor Macarthy was a stalwart
woman, and Eily's slender fingers could not stir the massive hand which
was pressed firmly upon her lips.At this moment her father entered hastily, with Phelim panting behind
him."Phwhat's the matther, woman?""Here's Phelim clane
out o' his head, an' shcramin' about Eily, an' marvels an' buttons, an'
I dunno what all.he added in a tone of great
alarm, as he saw Eileen in her mother's arms, flushed and disordered,
the tears rolling down her cheeks.cried Honor, "it's bewitched she is,--clane bewitched out
o' her sinses, an shpakes buttons out av her mouth wid ivery worrd she
siz.Who wud do ye sich an
ill turn as this, whin ye niver harmed annybody since the day ye were
born?""_Buttons!_" said Dennis Macarthy; "what do ye mane by buttons?How can
she shpake buttons, I'm askin' ye?Sure, ye're foolish yersilf, Honor,
woman!Lit the colleen go, an' she'll till me phwhat 'tis all about.""Och, av ye don't belave me!""Show thim to yer father,
Phelim!Look at two av thim there in the corner,--the dirrty things!"Phelim took up the two shining objects cautiously in the corner of his
pinafore and carried them to his father, who examined them long and
carefully.Finally he spoke, but in an altered voice."Lit the choild go, Honor," he said."I want to shpake till her.he added sternly; and very reluctantly his wife released poor
Eily, who stood pale and trembling, eager to explain, and yet afraid to
speak for fear of being again forcibly silenced."Eileen," said her father, "'tis plain to be seen that these things are
not buttons, but jew'ls."said Dennis; "jew'ls, or gims, whichiver ye plaze to call thim.Now, phwhat I want to know is, where did ye get thim?"cried Eily; "don't look at me that a-way!Sure, I've done
no harrum!another splendid diamond and another
white, glistening pearl fell from her lips; but she hurried on, speaking
as quickly as she could: "I wint to the forest to gather shticks, and
there I saw a little Grane Man, all the same loike a hoppergrass, caught
be his lig in a spidher's wib; and whin I lit him free he gi' me a wish,
to have whativer I loiked bist in the wurrld; an' so I wished, an' I
sid--" but by this time the pearls and diamonds were hopping like
hail-stones all over the cabin-floor; and with a look of deep anger and
sorrow Dennis Macarthy motioned to his wife to close Eileen's mouth
again, which she eagerly did."To think," he said, "as iver a child o' mine shud shtale the Countess's
jew'ls, an' thin till me a pack o' lies about thim!Honor, thim is the
beads o' the Countess's nickluss that I was tillin' ye about, that I saw
on her nick at the ball, whin I carried the washin' oop to the Castle.An' this misfortunate colleen has shwallied 'em.""How wud she shwally 'em,
an' have 'em in her mouth all the toime?An' how wud she get thim to
shwally, an' the Countess in Dublin these three weeks, an' her jew'ls
wid her?Shame an ye, Dinnis Macarthy!to suspict yer poor, diminted
choild of shtalin'!It's bewitched she is, I till ye!Look at the face
av her this minute!"Just at that moment the sound of wheels was heard; and Phelim, who was
standing at the open door, exclaimed,--

"Father!here's Docthor O'Shaughnessy dhrivin' past.cried both mother and father in a
breath.Phelim darted out, and soon returned, followed by the doctor,--a tall,
thin man with a great hooked nose, on which was perched a pair of green
spectacles.O'Shaughnessy; and now a cold shiver passed
over her as he fixed his spectacled eyes on her and listened in silence
to the confused accounts which her father and mother poured into his
ear.Let me see the jew'ls, as ye call thim."The pearls and diamonds were brought,--a whole handful of them,--and
poured into the doctor's hand, which closed suddenly over them, while
his dull black eyes shot out a quick gleam under the shading spectacles.The next moment, however, he laughed good-humoredly and turned them
carelessly over one by one."Why, Dinnis," he said, "'tis aisy to see that ye've not had mich
expeerunce o' jew'ls, me bye, or ye'd not mistake these bits o' glass
an' sich fer thim.there's no jew'ls here, wheriver the
Countess's are.An' these bits o' trash dhrop out o' the choild's mouth,
ye till me, ivery toime she shpakes?""Ivery toime, yer Anner!""Out they dhrops, an' goes hoppin'
an' leppin' about the room, loike they were aloive."This is a very sirrious case,
Misther Macarthy,--a very sirrious case _in_dade, sirr; an' I'll be free
to till ye that I know but _wan_ way av curin' it.""Och, whirrasthru!""What is it at all, Docthor
alanna?Is it a witch has overlooked her, or what is it?will I lose ye this-a-way?and in her grief she loosed her hold of Eileen and clapped her hands to
her own face, sobbing aloud.But before the child could open her lips to
speak, she found herself seized in another and no less powerful grasp,
while another hand covered her mouth,--not warm and firm like her
mother's, but cold, bony, and frog-like.Holding her as in a vice, Dr.O'Shaughnessy spoke once more to her parents."I'll save her loife," said he, "and mebbe her wits as well, av the
thing's poassible.But it's not here I can do ut at all.I'll take the
choild home wid me to me house, and Misthress O'Shaughnessy will tind
her as if she wuz her own; and thin I will try th' ixpirimint which is
the ownly thing on airth can save her.""Sure, there's two, three kinds o' mint growin'
here in oor own door-yard, but I dunno av there's anny o' that kind.Will ye make a tay av it, Docthor, or is it a poultuss ye'll be puttin'
an her, to dhraw out the witchcraft, loike?""Whisht, whisht, woman!""Howld yer prate,
can't ye, an' the docthor waitin'?Is there no way ye cud cure her, an'
lave her at home thin, Docthor?Faith, I'd be loth to lave her go away
from uz loike this, let alone the throuble she'll be to yez!""At laste," he added
more gravely, "naw moor thin I'd gladly take for ye an' yer good woman,
Dinnis!Come, help me wid the colleen, now.Now, thin, oop
wid ye, Eily!"And the next moment Eileen found herself in the doctor's narrow gig,
wedged tightly between him and the side of the vehicle."Ye can sind her bits o' clothes over by Phelim," said Dr.O'Shaughnessy, as he gathered up the reins, apparently in great haste.Good-day t' ye, Dinnis!My respicts to ye,
Misthress Macarthy.Ye'll hear av the choild in a day or two!"And
whistling to his old pony, they started off at as brisk a trot as the
latter could produce on such short notice.Was this the result of the fairy's gift?She sat still,
half-paralyzed with grief and terror, for she made no doubt that the
hated doctor was going to do something very, very dreadful to her.Seeing that she made no effort to free herself, or to speak, her captor
removed his hand from her mouth; but not until they were well out of
sight and hearing of her parents."Now, Eileen," he said, not unkindly, "av ye'll be a good colleen, and
not shpake a wurrd, I'll lave yer mouth free.But av ye shpake, so much
as to say, 'Bliss ye!'I'll tie up yer jaw wid me pock'-handkercher, so
as ye can't open ut at all.She had not the slightest desire to say "Bliss
ye!"O'Shaughnessy; nor did she care to fill his rusty old gig,
or to sprinkle the high road, with diamonds and pearls.said the Doctor, "that's a sinsible gyurrl as ye are.See, now, what a foine bit o' sweet-cake Misthress O'Shaughnessy 'ull be
givin' ye, whin we git home."The poor child burst into tears, for the word 'home' made her realize
more fully that she was going every moment farther and farther away from
her own home,--from her kind father, her anxious and loving mother, and
dear little Phelim.What would Phelim do at night, without her shoulder
to curl up on and go to sleep, in the trundle-bed which they had shared
ever since he was a tiny baby?Who would light her father's pipe, and
sing him the little song he always liked to hear while he smoked it
after supper?These, and many other such thoughts, filled Eileen's mind
as she sat weeping silently beside the green-spectacled doctor, who
cared nothing about her crying, so long as she did not try to speak.After a drive of some miles, they reached a tall, dark, gloomy-looking
house, which was not unlike the doctor himself, with its small greenish
window-panes and its gaunt chimneys.Here the pony stopped, and the
doctor, lifting Eileen out of the gig, carried her into the house.O'Shaughnessy came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron,
and stared in amazement at the burden in her husband's arms.Is she
kilt, or what's the matther?""Open the door o' the best room!""Open it,
woman, I'm tillin' ye!"and entering a large bare room, he set Eileen
down hastily on a stool, and then drew a long breath and wiped his brow."Safe and sound I've got ye now, glory for ut!And ye'll not lave this room until ye've made me _King av Ireland_!"Eileen stared at the man, thinking he had gone mad; for his face was
red, and his eyes, from which he had snatched the green spectacles,
glittered with a strange light.The same idea flashed into his wife's
mind, and she crossed herself devoutly, exclaiming,--

"Howly St.Pathrick, he's clane diminted.he said; "ye'll soon see
av I'm diminted.I till ye I'll be King av Ireland before the month's
oot.Open yer mouth, alanna, and make yer manners
to Misthress O'Shaughnessy."Thus adjured, Eileen dropped a courtesy, and said, timidly, "Good day t'
ye, Ma'm!down dropped a pearl and a diamond, and the doctor, pouncing
on them, held them up in triumph before the eyes of his astonished wife.There's no sich in Queen
Victory's crownd this day.That's a pearrl, an' as big
as a marrowfat pay.The loike of ut's not in Ireland, I till ye.Woman,
there's a fortin' in ivery wurrd this colleen shpakes!And she's goin'
to shpake," he added, grimly, "and to kape an shpakin', till Michael
O'Shaughnessy is rich enough to buy all Ireland,--ay, and England too,
av he'd a mind to!"O'Shaughnessy, utterly bewildered by her
husband's wild talk, and by the sight of the jewels, "what does it all
mane?And won't she die av 'em, av it's
that manny in her stumick?""Whisht wid yer foolery!""Swallied
'em, indade!The gyurrl has met a Grane Man, that's the truth of ut; and
he's gi'n her a wish, and she's got ut,--and now I've got _her_."And he
chuckled, and rubbed his bony hands together, while his eyes twinkled
with greed."Sure, ye always till't me there was no sich thing ava'.""I lied, an' that's all there is to
say about ut.Do ye think I'm obleeged to shpake the thruth ivery day in
the week to an ignor'nt crathur like yersilf?It's worn out I'd be, body
and sowl, at that rate.Now, Eileen Macarthy," he continued, turning to
his unhappy little prisoner, "ye are to do as I till ye, an' no
harrum'll coom to ye, an' maybe good.Ye are to sit in this room and
_talk_; and ye'll kape an talkin' till the room is _full-up_!"No less'll satisfy me, and it's the
laste ye can do for all the throuble I've taken forr ye.Misthress
O'Shaughnessy an' mesilf 'ull take turns sittin' wid ye, so 'at ye'll
have some wan to talk to.Ye'll have plinty to ate an' to dhrink, an'
that's more than manny people have in Ireland this day.With this, the worthy man proceeded to give strict injunctions to his
wife to keep the child talking, and not to leave her alone for an
instant; and finally he departed, shutting the door behind him, and
leaving the captive and her jailer alone together.O'Shaughnessy immediately poured forth a flood of questions, to
which Eileen replied by telling the whole pitiful story from beginning
to end.It was a relief to be able to speak at last, and to rehearse the
whole matter to understanding, if not sympathetic, ears.O'Shaughnessy listened and looked, looked and listened, with open mouth
and staring eyes.With her eyes shut, she would not have believed her
ears; but the double evidence was too much for her.The diamonds and pearls kept on falling, falling, fast and faster.They
filled Eileen's lap, they skipped away over the floor, while the
doctor's wife pursued them with frantic eagerness.Each diamond was
clear and radiant as a drop of dew, each pearl lustrous and perfect; but
they gave no pleasure now to the fairy-gifted child.She could only
think of the task that lay before her,--to FILL this great, empty room;
of the millions and millions, and yet again millions of gems that must
fall from her lips before the floor would be covered even a few inches
deep; of the weeks and months,--perhaps the years,--that must elapse
before she would see her parents and Phelim again.She remembered the
words of the fairy: "A day may come when you will wish with all your
heart to have the charm removed."And then, like a flash, came the
recollection of those other words: "When that day comes, come here to
this spot," and do so and so.In fancy, Eileen was transported again to the pleasant green forest; was
looking at the Green Man as he sat on the toadstool, and begging him to
take away this fatal gift, which had already, in one day, brought her so
much misery.Harshly on her reverie broke in the voice of Mrs.O'Shaughnessy, asking,--

"And has yer father sold his pigs yit?"She started, and came back to the doleful world of reality.But even as
she answered the woman's question, she made in her heart a firm
resolve,--somehow or other, _somehow_, she would escape; she would get
out of this hateful house, away from these greedy, grasping people; she
would manage somehow to find her way to the wood, and then--then for
freedom again!Cheered by her own resolution, she answered the woman
composedly, and went into a detailed account of the birth, rearing, and
selling of the pigs, which so fascinated her auditor that she was
surprised, when the recital was over, to find that it was nearly
supper-time.The doctor now entered, and taking his wife's place, began to ply Eily
with questions, each one artfully calculated to bring forth the longest
possible reply:--

"How is it yer mother is related to the Countess's auld housekeeper,
avick; and why is it, that wid sich grand relations she niver got into
the castle at all?""Phwhat was that I h'ard the other day about the looky bargain yer
father--honest man!--made wid the one-eyed peddler from beyant
Inniskeen?"and--

"Is it thrue that yer mother makes all her butther out av skim-milk just
by making the sign of the cross--God bless it!--over the churn?"Although she did not like the doctor, Eily did, as she had said to the
Green Man, "_loove_ to talk;" so she chattered away, explaining and
disclaiming, while the diamonds and pearls flew like hail-stones from
her lips, and her host and jailer sat watching them with looks of greedy
rapture.Eily paused, fairly out of breath, just as Mrs.O'Shaughnessy entered,
bringing her rather scanty supper.There was quite a pile of jewels in
her lap and about her feet, while a good many had rolled to a distance;
but her heart sank within her as she compared the result of three hours'
steady talking with the end to which the rapacious doctor aspired.She was allowed to eat her supper in peace, but no sooner was it
finished than the questioning began again, and it was not until ten
o'clock had struck that the exhausted child was allowed to lay her head
down on the rude bed which Mrs.O'Shaughnessy had hastily made up for
her.The next day was a weary one for poor Eily.From morning till night she
was obliged to talk incessantly, with only a brief space allowed for her
meals.The doctor and his wife mounted guard by turns, each asking
questions, until to the child's fancy they seemed like nothing but
living interrogation points.All day long, no matter what she was
talking about,--the potato-crop, or the black hen that the fox stole, or
Phelim's measles,--her mind was fixed on one idea, that of escaping from
her prison.If only some fortunate chance would call them both out of
the room at once!There was always a
pair of greedy eyes fixed on her, and on the now hated jewels which
dropped in an endless stream from her lips; always a harsh voice in her
ears, rousing her, if she paused for an instant, by new questions as
stupid as they were long.Once, indeed, the child stopped short, and declared that she could not
and would not talk any more; but she was speedily shown the end of a
birch rod, with the hint that the doctor "would be loth to use the likes
av it on Dinnis Macarthy's choild; but her parints had given him charge
to dhrive out the witchcraft be hook or be crook; and av a birch rod
wasn't first cousin to a crook, what was it at all?"and Eily was forced
to find her powers of speech again.By nightfall of this day the room was ankle-deep in pearls and diamonds.A wonderful sight it was, when the moon looked in at the window, and
shone on the lustrous and glittering heaps which Mrs.O'Shaughnessy
piled up with her broom.The woman was fairly frightened at the sight of
so much treasure, and she crossed herself many times as she lay down on
the mat beside Eileen's truckle-bed, muttering to herself, "Michael
knows bist, I suppose; but sorrow o' me if I can feel as if there was a
blissing an it, ava'!"The third day came, and was already half over, when an urgent summons
came for Doctor O'Shaughnessy.One of his richest patrons had fallen
from his horse and broken his leg, and the doctor must come on the
instant.The doctor grumbled and swore, but there was no help for it; so
he departed, after making his wife vow by all the saints in turn, that
she would not leave Eileen's side for an instant until he returned.When Eily heard the rattle of the gig and the sound of the pony's feet,
and knew that the most formidable of her jailers was actually _gone_,
her heart beat so loud for joy that she feared its throbbing would be
heard.Now, at last, a loop-hole seemed to open for her.She had a plan
already in her head, and now there was a chance for her to carry it out.But an Irish girl of ten has shrewdness beyond her years, and no gleam
of expression appeared in Eileen's face as she spoke to Mrs.O'Shaughnessy, who had been standing by the window to watch her
husband's departure, and who now returned to her seat."We'll be missin' the docthor this day, ma'm, won't we?""He's
so agrayable, ain't he, now?"O'Shaughnessy, with something of a sigh."He's rale agrayable, Michael is--whin he wants to be," she added."Yis,
I'll miss um more nor common to-day, for 'tis worn out I am intirely
wid shlapin so little these two nights past.Sure, I _can't_ shlape, wid
thim things a-shparklin' an' a-glowerin' at me the way they do; and now
I'll not get me nap at all this afthernoon, bein' I must shtay here and
kape ye talkin' till the docthor cooms back.Me hid aches, too, mortial
bad!""Arrah, it's too bad, intirely!Will I till ye a little shtory that me grandmother hed for the hidache?""A shtory for the hidache?""What do ye mane by
that, I'm askin' ye?""I dunno roightly how ut is," replied Eily, innocently, "but Granny used
to call this shtory a cure for the hidache, and mebbe ye'd find ut so.An' annyhow it 'ud kape me talkin'," she added meekly, "for 'tis mortial
long."O'Shaughnessy, settling herself more
comfortably in her chair."I loove a long shtory, to be sure.And Eily began as follows, speaking in a clear, low monotone:--

"Wanst upon a toime there lived an owld, owld woman, an' her name was
Moira Magoyle; an' she lived in an owld, owld house, in an owld, owld
lane that lid through an owld, owld wood be the side of an owld, owld
shthrame that flowed through an owld, owld shthrate av an owld, owld
town in an owld, owld county.An' this owld, owld woman, sure enough,
she had an owld, owld cat wid a white nose; an' she had an owld, owld
dog wid a black tail, an' she had an owld, owld hin wid wan eye, an' she
had an owld, owld cock wid wan leg, an' she had--"

Mrs.O'Shaughnessy yawned, and stirred uneasily on her seat."Seems to
me there's moighty little goin' an in this shtory!"she said, taking up
her knitting, which she had dropped in her lap."I'd loike somethin' a
bit more loively, I'm thinkin', av I had me ch'ice."said Eily, with quiet confidence, "ownly wait till I
coom to the parrt about the two robbers an' the keg o' gunpowdther, an'
its loively enough ye'll foind ut.But I must till ut the same way 'at
Granny did, else it 'ull do no good, ava.Well, thin, I was sayin' to
ye, ma'm, this owld woman (Saint Bridget be good to her!)she had an
owld, owld cow, an' she had an owld, owld shape, an' she had an owld,
owld kitchen wid an owld, owld cheer an' an owld, owld table, an' an
owld, owld panthry wid an owld, owld churn, an' an owld, owld sauce-pan,
an' an owld, owld gridiron, an' an owld, owld--"

Mrs.O'Shaughnessy's knitting dropped again, and her head fell forward
on her breast.Eileen's voice grew lower and softer, but still she went
on,--rising at the same time, and moving quietly, stealthily, towards
the door,--

"An' she had an owld, owld kittle, an' she had an owld, owld pot wid an
owld, owld kiver; an' she had an owld, owld jug, an' an owld, owld
platther, an' an owld, owld tay-pot--"

Eily's hand was on the door, her eyes were fixed on the motionless form
of her jailer; her voice went on and on, its soft monotone now
accompanied by another sound,--that of a heavy, regular breathing which
was fast deepening into a snore."An' she had an owld, owld shpoon, an' an owld, owld fork, an' an owld,
owld knife, an' an owld, owld cup, an' an owld, owld bowl, an' an owld,
owld, owld--"

The door is open!Two little feet go speeding down
the long passage, across the empty kitchen, out at the back door, and
away, away!the story is done and the
bird is flown!Surely it was the next thing to flying, the way in which Eily sped
across the meadows, far from the hated scene of her imprisonment.The
bare brown feet seemed scarcely to touch the ground; the brown locks
streamed out on the wind; the little blue apron fluttered wildly, like a
banner of victory.with panting bosom, with parted lips,
with many a backward glance to see if any one were following; on went
the little maid, over field and fell, through moss and through mire,
till at last--oh, happy, blessed sight!--the dark forest rose before
her, and she knew that she was saved.Quite at the other end of the wood lay the spot she was seeking; but she
knew the way well, and on she went, but more carefully now,--parting the
branches so that she broke no living twig, and treading cautiously lest
she should crush the lady fern, which the Green Men love.How beautiful
the ferns were, uncurling their silver-green fronds and spreading their
slender arms abroad!How pleasant,
how kind, how friendly was everything in the sweet green wood!And here at last was the oak-tree, and at the foot of it there stood the
yellow toadstool, looking as if it did not care about anything or
anybody, which in truth it did not: Breathless with haste and eagerness,
Eileen tapped the toadstool three times with a bit of holly, saying
softly, "Slanegher Banegher!there
sat the Green Man, just as if he had been there all the time, fanning
himself with his scarlet cap, and looking at her with a comical twinkle
in his sharp little eyes."Well, Eily," he said, "is it back so soon ye are?Well, well, I'm not
surprised!"Oh, yer Honor's Riverence--Grace, I mane!"cried poor Eily, bursting
into tears, "av ye'll plaze to take it away!Sure it's nearly kilt I am
along av it, an' no plazure or coomfort in ut at all at all!Take it
away, yer Honor, take it away, and I'll bliss ye all me days!"and, with
many sobs, she related the experiences of the past three days.As she
spoke, diamonds and pearls still fell in showers from her lips, and
half-unconsciously she held up her apron to catch them as they fell, so
that by the time she had finished her story she had more than a quart of
splendid gems, each as big as the biggest kind of pea.The Green Man smiled, but not unkindly, at the recital of Eileen's
woes."Faith, it's a hard time ye've had, my maiden, and no mistake!Hold fast the jewels ye have there, for they're the
last ye'll get."He touched her lips with his cap, and said, "Cabbala
ku!Eily drew a long breath of relief, and the fairy added,--

"The truth is, Eily, the times are past for fairy gifts of this kind.Few people believe in the Green Men now at all, and fewer still ever see
them.Why, ye are the first mortal child I've spoken to for a matter of
two hundred years, and I think ye'll be the last I ever speak to.Fairy
gifts are very pretty things in a story, but they're not convenient at
the present time, as ye see for yourself.There's one thing I'd like to
say to ye, however," he added more seriously; "an' ye'll take it as a
little lesson-like, me dear, before we part.Ye asked me for diamonds
and pearls, and I gave them to ye; and now ye've seen the worth of that
kind for yourself.But there's jewels and jewels in the world, and if
ye choose, Eily, ye can still speak pearls and diamonds, and no harm to
yourself or anybody.""Sure, I don't
undershtand yer Honor at all.""Likely not," said the little man, "but it's now I'm telling ye.Every
gentle and loving word ye speak, child, is a pearl; and every kind deed
done to them as needs kindness, is a diamond brighter than all those
shining stones in your apron.Ye'll grow up a rich woman, Eily, with the
treasure ye have there; but it might all as well be frogs and toads, if
with it ye have not the loving heart and the helping hand that will make
a good woman of ye, and happy folk of yer neighbors.And now good-by,
mavourneen, and the blessing of the Green Men go with ye and stay with
ye, yer life long!""Good-by, yer Honor," cried Eily, gratefully."The saints reward yer
Honor's Grace for all yer kindness to a poor silly colleen like me!But,
oh, wan minute, yer Honor!"she cried, as she saw the little man about
to put on his cap."Will Docthor O'Shaughnessy be King av Ireland?Sure
it's the wicked king he'd make, intirely.Don't let him, plaze, yer
Honor!"Have no fears, Eily,
alanna!O'Shaughnessy has come into his kingdom by this time, and I
wish him joy of it."With these words he clapped his scarlet cap on his head, and vanished
like the snuff of a candle.*       *       *       *       *

Now, just about this time Dr.Michael O'Shaughnessy was dismounting from
his gig at his own back door, after a long and weary drive.He thought
little, however, about his bodily fatigue, for his heart was full of joy
and triumph, his mind absorbed in dreams of glory.He could not even
contain his thoughts, but broke out into words, as he unharnessed the
rusty old pony."An' whin I coom to the palace, I'll knock three times wid the knocker;
or maybe there'll be a bell, loike the sheriff's house (bad luck to um!)And the gossoon'll open the dure, and--

"'Phwhat's yer arrind?'"'It's Queen Victory I'm wantin',' says I.'An' ye'll till her King
Michael av Ireland is askin' for her,' I says."Thin whin Victory hears that, she'll coom roonnin' down hersilf, to bid
me welkim; an' she'll take me oop to the best room, an'--

"'Sit down an the throne, King Michael,' says she.'The other cheers
isn't good enough for the loikes of ye,' says she."'Afther ye, ma'm,' says I, moinding me manners."'An' is there annythin' I can du for ye, to-day, King Michael?'says
she, whin we've sat down an the throne."An' I says, loight and aisy loike, all as if I didn't care, 'Nothin' in
loife, ma'm, I'm obleeged to ye, widout ye'd lind me the loan o' yer
Sunday crownd,' says I, 'be way av a patthern,' says I."An' says she--"

But at this moment the royal meditations were rudely broken in upon by a
wild shriek which resounded from the house.The door was flung violently
open, and Mrs.O'Shaughnessy rushed out like a mad woman."The colleen's gone, an' me niver
shtirrin' from her side!Och, wirra, wirra!It must be the
witches has taken her clane up chimley."O'Shaughnessy stood for a moment transfixed, glaring with speechless
rage at the unhappy woman; then rushing suddenly at her, he seized and
shook her till her teeth chattered together.he yelled, beside himself with rage and
disappointment."Ye've fell ashlape, an' laved her shlip out!Sorrow
seize ye, ye're always the black bean in me porridge!"Then flinging her
from him, he cried, "I don't care!I'll be king wid
what's in there now!"He paused before the door of the best room, lately poor Eily's prison,
to draw breath and to collect his thoughts.The door was closed, and
from within--hark!Waking suddenly from her nap, had she
failed to see the girl, who had perhaps been sleeping, too?At all
events the jewels were there, in shining heaps on the floor, as he had
last seen them, with thousands more covering the floor in every
direction,--a king's ransom in half a handful of them.He would be king
yet, even if the girl were gone.Cautiously he opened the door and
looked in, his eyes glistening, his mouth fairly watering at the thought
of all the splendor which would meet his glance.Captive was there none, yet the room was not empty.Jewels were there none, yet the floor was covered; covered with living
creatures,--toads, snakes, newts, all hideous and unclean reptiles that
hop or creep or wriggle.And as the wretched man stared, with open mouth
and glaring eye-balls, oh, horror!they were all hopping, creeping,
wriggling towards the open door,--towards him!With a yell beside which
his wife's had been a whisper, O'Shaughnessy turned and fled; but after
him--through the door, down the passage and out of the house--came
hopping, creeping, wriggling his myriad pursuers.stretch your long legs, and run like a hunted hare
over hill and dale, over moss and moor.They are close behind you; they
are catching at your heels; they come from every side, surrounding you!Fly, King O'Shaughnessy!The Green Men are
hunting you, if you could but know it, in sport and in revenge; and
three times they will chase you round County Kerry, for thrice three
days, till at last they suffer you to drop exhausted in a bog, and
vanish from your sight.Eily went home with her apron full of pearls and diamonds, to
tell her story again, and this time to be believed.And she grew up a
good woman and a rich woman; and she married the young Count of
Kilmoggan, and spoke diamonds and pearls all her life long,--at least
her husband said she did, and he ought to know.cried Toto, springing lightly into the barn, and waving a
basket round his head.Spanish, Dame Clucket, where
are you all?I want all the fresh eggs you can spare, please!directly-now-this-very-moment!"and the boy tossed his basket up in the
air and caught it again, and danced a little dance of pure enjoyment,
while he waited for the hens to answer his summons.Speckle and Dame Clucket, who had been having a quiet chat together
in the mow, peeped cautiously over the billows of hay, and seeing that
Toto was alone, bade him good-morning."I don't know about eggs, to-day, Toto!""I want to
set soon, and I cannot be giving you eggs every day.""Oh, but I haven't had any for two or three days!""And I
_must_ have some to-day.Good old Clucket, dear old Cluckety, give me
some, please!""Well, I never can refuse that boy, somehow!"said Dame Clucket, half to
herself; and Mrs.Speckle agreed with her that it could not be done.Indeed, it would have been hard to say "No!"to Toto at that moment, for
he certainly was very pleasant to look at.The dusty sunbeams came
slanting through the high windows, and fell on his curly head, his
ruddy-brown cheeks, and honest gray eyes; and as the eyes danced, and
the curls danced, and the whole boy danced with the dancing sunbeams,
why, what could two soft-hearted old hens do but meekly lead the way to
where their cherished eggs lay, warm and white, in their fragrant nests
of hay?"And what is to be done with them?"Speckle, as the last egg
disappeared into the basket."We are going to have a party
to-night,--a real party!Baldhead is coming, and Jim Crow, and
Ger-Falcon.And Granny and Bruin are making all sorts of good
things,--I'll bring you out some, if I can, dear old Speckly,--and these
eggs are for a custard, don't you see?""And <DW53> and I are decorating the kitchen," continued he; "and Cracker
is cracking the nuts and polishing the apples; and Pigeon Pretty and
Miss Mary are dusting the ornaments,--so you see we are all very busy
indeed.and off ran boy Toto, with his basket of eggs, leaving the
two old hens to scratch about in the hay, clucking rather sadly over the
memories of their own chickenhood, when they, too, went to parties,
instead of laying eggs for other people's festivities.In the cottage, what a bustle was going on!The grandmother was at her
pastry-board, rolling out paste, measuring and filling and covering, as
quickly and deftly as if she had had two pairs of eyes instead of none
at all.The bear, enveloped in a huge blue-checked apron, sat with a
large mortar between his knees, pounding away at something as if his
life depended on it.On the hearth sat the squirrel, cracking nuts and
piling them up in pretty blue china dishes; and the two birds were
carefully brushing and dusting, each with a pair of dusters which she
always carried about with her,--one pair gray, and the other soft brown.As for Toto and the raccoon, they were here, there, and everywhere, all
in a moment."Now, then, where are those greens?"called the boy, when he had
carefully deposited his basket of eggs in the pantry.replied <DW53>, appearing at the same moment from the
shed, dragging a mass of ground-pine, fragrant fir-boughs, and
alder-twigs with their bright coral-red berries."We will stand these
big boughs in the corners, Toto.The creeping stuff will go over the
looking-glass and round the windows."Yes, that will do very well," said Toto."We shall need steps, though,
to reach so high, and the step-ladder is broken.""Bruin will be the step-ladder.Stand up here,
Bruin, and make yourself useful."The good bear meekly obeyed, and the raccoon, mounting nimbly upon his
shoulders, proceeded to arrange the trailing creepers with much grace
and dexterity."This reminds me of some of our honey-hunts, old fellow!""Do you remember the famous one we had in the
autumn, a little while before we came here?""That was, indeed, a famous hunt!It gave us our whole winter's supply of honey.And we might have got
twice as much more, if it hadn't been for the accident.""Tell us about it," said Toto."I wasn't with you, you know; and then
came the moving, and I forgot to ask you."<DW53>, you see, had discovered this hive in a big oak-tree, hollow
from crotch to ground.He couldn't get at it alone, for the clever bees
had made it some way down inside the trunk, and he couldn't reach far
enough down unless some one held him on the outside.So we went
together, and I stood on my hind tip-toes, and then he climbed up and
stood on my head, and I held his feet while he reached down into the
hole."said the grandmother, "that was very dangerous, Bruin."Well, you see, dear Madam," replied the bear, apologetically, "it was
really the only way.I couldn't stand on <DW53>'s head and have him hold
_my_ feet, you know; and we couldn't give up the honey, the finest crop
of the season.So--"

"Oh, it was all right!""At least, it was at
first.There was such a quantity of honey,--pots and pots of it!--and
all of the very best quality.I took out comb after comb, laying them in
the crotch of the tree for safe-keeping till I was ready to go down.""But where were the bees all the time?"replied the raccoon, "buzzing about and making a
fine fuss.They tried to sting me, of course, but my fur was too much
for them.The only part I feared for was my nose, and that I had covered
with two or three thicknesses of mullein-leaves, tied on with stout
grass.But as ill-luck would have it, they found out Bruin, and began to
buzz about him, too.One flew into his eye, and he let my feet go for an
instant,--just just for the very instant when I was leaning down as far
as I could possibly stretch to reach a particularly fine comb.Up went
my heels, of course, and down went I.""My _dear_ <DW53>!do you mean--"

"I mean _down_, dear Madam!"repeated the raccoon, gravely,--"the very
downest down there was, I assure you.I fell through that hollow tree as
the falling star darts through the ambient heavens.Luckily there was a
soft bed of moss and rotten wood at the bottom, or I might not have had
the happiness of being here at this moment.As it was--"

"As it was," interrupted the bear, "I dragged him out by the tail
through the hole at the bottom.Indeed, he looked like a hive
himself, covered from head to foot with wax and honey, and a cloud of
bees buzzing about him.But he had a huge piece of comb in each paw, and
was gobbling away, eating honey, wax, bees and all, as if nothing had
happened.""Naturally," said the raccoon, "I am of a saving disposition, as you
know, and cannot bear to see anything wasted.It is not generally known
that bees add a slight pungent flavor to the honey, which is very
agreeable.he repeated, throwing his head back, and
screwing up one eye, to contemplate the arrangement he had just
completed."How is that, Toto; pretty, eh?""But, see here, if you keep Bruin there all
day, we shall never get through all we have to do.Jump down, that's a
good fellow, and help me to polish these tankards."When all was ready, as in due time it was, surely it would have been
hard to find a pleasanter looking place than that kitchen.The clean
white walls were hung with wreaths and garlands, while the great
fir-boughs in the corners filled the air with their warm, spicy
fragrance.Every bit of metal--brass, copper, or steel--was polished so
that it shone resplendent, giving back the joyous blaze of the crackling
fire in a hundred tiny reflections.The kettle was especially glorious,
and felt the importance of its position keenly."I trust you have no unpleasant feeling about this," it said to the
black soup-kettle."Every one cannot be beautiful, you know.If you are
useful, you should be content with that."Some have the fun, and some have the trouble!""My business is to make soup, and I make it.The table was covered with a snowy cloth, and set with glistening
crockery--white and blue--and clean shining pewter.The great tankard
had been brought out of its cupboard, and polished within an inch of its
life; while the three blue ginger-jars, filled with scarlet
alder-berries, looked down complacently from their station on the
mantelpiece.As for the floor, I cannot give you an idea of the
cleanness of it.When everything else was ready and in place, the bear
had fastened a homemade scrubbing-brush to each of his four feet, and
then executed a sort of furious scrubbing-dance, which fairly made the
house shake; and the result was a shining purity which vied with that
of the linen table-cloth, or the very kettle itself.And you should have seen the good bear, when his toilet was completed!The scrubbing-brushes had been applied to his own shaggy coat as well as
to the floor, and it shone, in its own way, with as much lustre as
anything else; and in his left ear was stuck a red rose, from the
monthly rose-bush which stood in the sunniest window and blossomed all
winter long.It is extremely uncomfortable to have a rose stuck in one's
ear,--you may try it yourself, and see how you like it; but Toto had
stuck it there, and nothing would have induced Bruin to remove it.And
you should have seen our Toto himself, carrying his own roses on his
cheeks, and enough sunshine in his eyes to make a thunder-cloud laugh!And you should have seen the great <DW53>, glorious in scarlet
neck-ribbon, and behind his ear (_not_ in it!<DW53> was not Bruin) a
scarlet feather, the gift of Miss Mary, and very precious.And you
should have seen the little squirrel, attired in his own bushy tail,
and rightly thinking that he needed no other adornment; and the parrot
and the wood-pigeon, both trim and elegant, with their plumage arranged
to the last point of perfection.Last of all, you should have seen the
dear old grandmother, the beloved Madam, with her snowy curls and cap
and kerchief; and the ebony stick which generally lived in a drawer and
silver paper, and only came out on great occasions.How proud Toto was
of his Granny!and how the others all stood around her, gazing with
wondering admiration at her gold-bowed spectacles (for those she usually
wore were of horn) and the large breastpin, with a weeping-willow
displayed upon it, which fastened her kerchief."Made out of your grandfather's tail, did you say, Toto?"said the bear,
in an undertone.cried the boy, half pettishly.Surely you might know by this time that we have no tails.""I beg your pardon,
Toto, boy.You are not really vexed with old Bruin?"Toto rubbed his curly head affectionately against the shaggy black one,
in token of amity, and the bear continued:--

"When Madam was a young grandmother, was she as beautiful as she is
now?""Why, yes, I fancy so," replied Toto."Only she wasn't a grandmother
then, you know."You never were
anything but a boy, were you?"When Granny
was young, she was a girl, you see.""I--do--_not_--believe it!I saw a girl once--many years ago; it squinted, and its hair was frowzy,
and it wore a hideous basket of flowers on its head,--a dreadful
creature!Madam never can have looked like _that_!"At this moment a knock was heard at the door.Toto flew to open it, and
with a beaming face ushered in the old hermit, who entered leaning on
his stick, with his crow perched on one shoulder and the hawk on the
other.What bows and
courtesies, and whisking of tails and flapping of wings!The hermit's
bow in greeting to the old lady was so stately that Master <DW53> was
consumed with a desire to imitate it; and in so doing, he stepped back
against the nose of the tea-kettle and burned himself, which caused him
to retire suddenly under the table with a smothered shriek.And the hawk and the pigeon, the raccoon and the crow,
the hermit and the bear, all shook paws and claws, and vowed that they
were delighted to see each other; and what is more, they really _were_
delighted, which is not always the case when such vows are made.Now, when all had become well acquainted, and every heart was prepared
to be merry, they sat down to supper; and the supper was not one which
was likely to make them less cheerful.For there was chicken and ham,
and, oh, such a mutton-pie!You never saw such a pie; the standing crust
was six inches high, and solid as a castle wall; and on that lay the
upper-crust, as lightly as a butterfly resting on a leaf; while inside
was store of good mutton, and moreover golden eggballs and tender little
onions, and gravy as rich as all the kings of the earth put together.and besides all that there was white bread like snow, and brown
bread as sweet as clover-blossoms, and jam and gingerbread, and apples
and nuts, and pitchers of cream and jugs of buttermilk.Truly, it does
one's heart good to think of such a supper, and I only wish that you and
I had been there to help eat it.However, there was no lack of hungry
mouths, with right good-will to keep their jaws at work, and for a time
there was little conversation around the table, but much joy and comfort
in the good victuals.The good grandmother ate little herself, though she listened with
pleasure to the stirring sound of knives and forks, which told her that
her guests were well and pleasantly employed.Presently the hermit
addressed her, and said:--

"Honored Madam, you will be glad to know that there has been a great
change in the weather during the past week.Truly, I think the spring is
at hand; for the snow is fast melting away, the sun shines with more
than winter's heat, and the air to-day is mild and soft."At these words there was a subdued but evident excitement among the
company.The raccoon and the squirrel exchanged swift and significant
glances; the birds, as if by one unconscious impulse, ruffled their
feathers and plumed themselves a little.But boy Toto's face fell, and
he looked at the bear, who, for his part, scratched his nose and looked
intently at the pattern on his plate."It has been a long, an unusually long, season," continued the hermit,
"though doubtless it has seemed much shorter to you in your cosey
cottage than to me in my lonely cavern.But I have lived the
forest-life long enough to know that some of you, my friends," and he
turned with a smile to the forest-friends, "must be already longing to
hear the first murmur of the greenwood spring, and to note in tree and
shrub the first signs of awakening life."There was a moment of silence, during which the raccoon shifted uneasily
on his seat, and looked about him with restless, gleaming eyes.Suddenly
the silence was broken by a singular noise, which made every one start.It was a long-drawn sound, something between a snort, a squeal, and a
snore; and it came from--where _did_ it come from?"It seemed to come," said the hawk, who sat facing the fire, "from the
wall near the fireplace."At this moment the sound was heard again, louder and more distinct, and
this time it certainly _did_ come from the wall,--or rather from the
cupboard in the wall, near the fireplace.Then came a muffled, scuffling sound, and finally
a shrill peevish voice cried, "Let me out!<DW53>, I
know your tricks; let me out, or I'll tell Bruin this minute!"The bear burst into a volcanic roar of laughter, which made the hermit
start and turn pale in spite of himself, and going to the cupboard he
drew out the unhappy woodchuck, hopelessly entangled in his worsted
covering, from which he had been vainly struggling to free himself.It seemed as they would never have done
laughing; while every moment the woodchuck grew more furious,--squeaking
and barking, and even trying to bite the mighty paw which held him.But
the wood-pigeon had pity on him, and with a few sharp pulls broke the
worsted net, and begged Bruin to set him down on the table.This being
done, Master Chucky found his nose within precisely half an inch of a
most excellent piece of dried beef, upon which he fell without more ado,
and stayed not to draw breath till the plate was polished clean and
dry.That made every one laugh again, and altogether they were very merry,
and fell to playing games and telling stories, leaving the woodchuck to
try the keen edge of his appetite upon every dish on the table.By-and-by, however, this gentleman could eat no more; so he wiped his
paws and whiskers, brushed his coat a little, and then joined in the
sport with right good-will.It was a pleasant sight to see the great bear blindfolded, chasing Toto
and <DW53> from one corner to another, in a grand game of blindman's buff;
it was pleasant to see them playing leap-frog, and spin-the-platter, and
many a good old-fashioned game besides.Then, when these sat down to
rest and recover their breath, what a treat it was to see the four birds
dance a quadrille, to the music of Toto's fiddle!How they fluttered and
sidled, and hopped and bridled!How gracefully Miss Mary courtesied to
the stately hawk; and how jealous the crow was of this rival, who stood
on one leg with such a perfect grace!altogether that was a party worth going to.And when late in the
evening it broke up, and the visitors started on their homeward walk,
all declared it was the merriest time they had yet had together, and all
wished that they might have many more such times.And yet each one knew
in his heart,--and grieved to know,--that it was the last, and that the
end was come.The woodchuck sounded, the next morning, the note
which had for days been vibrating in the hearts of all the wild
creatures, but which they had been loth to strike, for Toto's sake.I don't know what you are all
thinking of, to stay on here after you are awake.I smelt the wet earth
and the water, and the sap running in the trees, even in that dungeon
where you had put me.The young reeds will soon be starting beside the
pool, and it is my work to trim them and thin them out properly;
besides, I am going to dig a new burrow, this year.And the squirrel with a chuckle, and the wood-pigeon with a sigh, and
the raccoon with a strange feeling which he hardly understood, but
which was not all pleasure, echoed the words, "We must be off!"Only the
bear said nothing, for he was in the wood-shed, splitting kindling-wood
with a fury of energy which sent the chips flying as if he were a
saw-mill.So it came to pass that on a soft, bright day in April, when the sun was
shining sweetly, and the wind blew warm from the south, and the buds
were swelling on willow and alder, the party of friends stood around the
door of the little cottage, exchanging farewells, half merry, half sad,
and wholly loving."After all, it is hardly good-by!""We shall
be here half the time, just as we were last summer; and the other half,
Toto will be in the forest.But Bruin rubbed his nose with his right paw, and said nothing."And you will come to the forest, too, dear Madam!"cried the raccoon,
"will you not?You will bring the knitting and the gingerbread, and we
will have picnics by the pool, and you will learn to love the forest as
much as Toto does.But Bruin rubbed his nose with his left paw, and still said nothing."And when my nest is made, and my little ones are fledged," cooed the
wood-pigeon in her tender voice, "their first flight shall be to you,
dear Madam, and their first song shall tell you that they love you, and
that we love you, every day and all day.For we do love you; don't we,
Bruin?"But the bear only looked helplessly around him, and scratched his head,
and again said nothing."Well," said Toto, cheerily, though with a suspicion of a quiver in his
voice, "you are all jolly good fellows, and we have had a merry winter
together.Of course we shall miss you sadly, Granny and I; but as you
say, Cracker, we shall all see each other every day; and I am longing
for the forest, too, almost as much as you are.""Dear friends," said the blind grandmother, folding her hands upon her
stick, and turning her kindly face from one to the other of the
group,--"dear friends, merry and helpful companions, this has indeed
been a happy season that we have spent together.You have, one and all,
been a comfort and a help to me, and I think you have not been
discontented yourselves; still, the confinement has of course been
strange to you, and we cannot wonder that you pine for your free,
wildwood life.it is a mischievous paw, but it
has never played any tricks on me, and has helped me many and many a
time.My little Cracker, I shall miss your merry chatter as I sit at my
spinning-wheel.Mary, and Pigeon Pretty, let me stroke your soft
feathers once more, by way of 'good-by.'Woodchuck, I have seen little
of you, but I trust you have enjoyed your visit, in your own way."And now, last of all, Bruin!come here and let
me shake your honest, shaggy paw, and thank you for all that you have
done for me and for my boy.""Why, where _is_ Bruin?"cried Toto, starting and looking round; "surely
he was here a minute ago.But no deep voice was heard, roaring cheerfully, "Here, Toto boy!"No
shaggy form came in sight."He has gone on ahead, probably," said the raccoon; "he said something,
this morning, about not liking to say good-by.Come, you others, we must
follow our leader.And with many a backward glance, and many a wave of paw, or tail, or
fluttering wing, the party of friends took their way to the forest home.Boy Toto stood with his hands in his pockets, looking after them with
bright, wide-open eyes.He did not cry,--it was a part of Toto's creed
that boys did not cry after they had left off petticoats,--but he felt
that if he had been a girl, the tears might have come in spite of him.So he stared very hard, and puckered his mouth in a silent whistle, and
felt of the marbles in his pockets,--for that is always a soothing and
comforting thing to do."Toto, dear," said his grandmother, "do you think our Bruin is really
_gone_, without saying a word of farewell to us?"cried the old lady, putting her handkerchief
to her sightless eyes,--"very, very much grieved!If it had been <DW53>,
now, I should not have been so much surprised; but for Bruin, our
faithful friend and helper, to leave us so, seems--"

"_Hello!_" cried Toto, starting suddenly, "what is that noise?"on the quiet air came the sharp crashing sound
of an axe.I'll go--" and with that
he went, as if he had been shot out of a catapult.Rushing into the wood-shed, he caught sight of the well-beloved shaggy
figure, just raising the axe to deliver a fearful blow at an unoffending
log of wood.Flinging his arms round it (the figure, not the axe nor the
log), he gave it such a violent hug that bear and boy sat down suddenly
on the ground, while the axe flew to the other end of the shed.cried Toto, "we thought you were gone, without
saying a word to us.The bear rubbed his nose confusedly, and muttered something about "a few
more sticks in case of cold weather."But here Toto burst out laughing in spite of himself, for the shed was
piled so high with kindling-wood that the bear sat as it were at the
bottom of a pit whose sides of neatly split sticks rose high above his
head."There's kindling-wood enough here to
last us ten years, at the very least.She
thought--"

"There will be more butter to make, now, Toto, since that new calf has
come," said the bear, breaking in with apparent irrelevance."And that pig is getting too big for you to manage," continued Bruin, in
a serious tone."He was impudent to _me_ the other day, and I had to
take him up by the tail and swing him, before he would apologize.Now,
you _couldn't_ take him up by the tail, Toto, much less swing him, and
there is no use in your deceiving yourself about it.""No one could, except you, old
monster.But what _are_ you thinking about that for, now?Granny will think you are gone, after all."And catching the
bear by the ear, he led him back in triumph to the cottage-door, crying,
"Granny, Granny!Now give him a good scolding, please, for
frightening us so."She only stroked the shaggy black
fur, and said, "Bruin, dear!my good, faithful, true-hearted Bruin!I
could not bear to think that you had left me without saying good-by.But you would not have done it, would you,
Bruin?The bear looked about him distractedly, and bit his paw severely, as if
to relieve his feelings."At least, if I meant
to say good-by.I wouldn't say it, because I couldn't.But I don't mean
to say it,--I mean I don't mean to do it.If you don't want me in the
house,--being large and clumsy, as I am well aware, and ugly too,--I can
sleep out by the pump, and come in to do the work.But I cannot leave
the boy, please, dear Madam, nor you.And the calf wants attention, and
that pig _ought_ to be swung at least once a week, and--and--"

But there was no need of further speech, for Toto's arms were clinging
round his neck, and Toto's voice was shouting exclamations of delight;
and the grandmother was shaking his great black paw, and calling him
her best friend, her dearest old Bruin, and telling him that he should
never leave them.And, in fact, he never did leave them.He settled down quietly in the
little cottage, and washed and churned, baked and brewed, milked the cow
and kept the pig in order.Happy was the good bear, and happy was Toto,
in those pleasant days.For every afternoon, when the work was done,
they welcomed one or all of their forest friends; or else they sought
the green, beloved forest themselves, and sat beside the fairy pool, and
wandered in the cool green mazes where all was sweetness and peace, with
rustle of leaves and murmur of water, and chirp of bird and insect.But
evening found them always at the cottage door again, bringing their
woodland joyousness to the blind grandmother, making the kitchen ring
with laughter as they related the last exploits of the raccoon or the
squirrel, or described the courtship of the parrot and the crow.And if you had asked any of the three, as they sat together in the
porch, who was the happiest person in the world, why, Toto and the
Grandmother would each have answered, "I!"But Bruin, who had never
studied grammar, and knew nothing whatever about his nominatives and his
accusatives, would have roared with a thunder-burst of enthusiasm,

Transcriber's Notes:

Obvious punctuation errors repaired.Page 44, illustration caption, "Wah-song!We
are not forging fetters for our children, but we are breaking those our
fathers made for us.We are the advocates of inquiry, of investigation
and thought.This of itself, is an admission that we are not perfectly
satisfied with all our conclusions.Philosophy has not the egotism of
faith.While superstition builds walls and creates obstructions, science
opens all the highways of thought.Stars and Grains of Sand

We do not say that we have discovered all; that our doctrines are the
all in all of truth.We know of no end to the development of man.We
cannot unravel the infinite complications of matter and force.The
history of one monad is as unknown as that of the universe; one drop of
water is as wonderful as all the seas; one leaf, as all the forests; and
one grain of sand, as all the stars.The Trinity of Science

Reason, Observation and Experience--the Holy Trinity of Science--have
taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is
now, and the way to be happy is to make others so.In this belief we are content to live and die.If by any possibility
the existence of a power superior to, and independent of, nature shall
be demonstrated, there will then be time enough to kneel.Until then,
let us all stand nobly erect.The Old and the New Old ideas perished in the retort of the
chemist, and useful truths took their places.One by one religious
conceptions have been placed in the crucible of science, and thus far,
nothing but dross has been found.A new world has been discovered by the
microscope; everywhere has been found the infinite; in every direction
man has investigated and explored, and nowhere, in earth or stars,
has been found the footstep of any being superior to or independent
of nature.Nowhere has been discovered the slightest evidence of any
interference from without.The Triumphs of Science

I do not know what inventions are in the brain of the future; I do not
know what garments of glory may be woven for the world in the loom of
years to be; we are just on the edge of the great ocean of discovery.I
do not know what is to be discovered; I do not know what science will do
for us.I do know that science did just take a handful of sand and make
the telescope, and with it read all the starry leaves of heaven; I know
that science took the thunderbolts from the hands of Jupiter, and now
the electric spark, freighted with thought and love, flashes under the
waves of the sea; I know that science stole a tear from the cheek of
unpaid labor, converted it into steam, and created a giant that turns
with tireless arms the countless wheels of toil; I know that science
broke the chains from human limbs and gave us instead the forces of
nature for our slaves; I know that we have made the attraction of
gravitation work for us; we have made the lightnings our messengers; we
have taken advantage of fire and flames and wind and sea; these slaves
have no backs to be whipped; they have no hearts to be lacerated; they
have no children to be stolen, no cradles to be violated.I know that
science has given us better houses; I know it has given us better
pictures and better books; I know it has given us better wives and
better husbands, and more beautiful children.I know it has enriched
a thousand-fold our life; and therefore I am in favor of perfect
intellectual liberty.It found the world at the mercy of disease and famine; men trying to
read their fates in the stars, and to tell their fortunes by signs and
wonders; generals thinking to conquer their enemies by making the sign
of the cross, or by telling a rosary.It found all history full of petty
and ridiculous falsehood, and the Almighty was supposed to spend most
of his time turning sticks into snakes, drowning boys for swimming on
Sunday, and killing little children for the purpose of converting their
parents.It found the earth filled with slaves and tyrants, the people
in all countries downtrodden, half naked, half starved, without hope,
and without reason in the world.Science the only Lever

Such was the condition of man when the morning of science dawned upon
his brain, and before he had heard the sublime declaration that the
universe is governed by law.For the change that has taken place we are
indebted solely to science--the only lever capable of raising mankind.Abject faith is barbarism; reason is civilization.To obey is slavish;
to act from a sense of obligation perceived by the reason, is noble.Ignorance worships mystery; Reason explains it: the one grovels, the
other soars.I have sometimes wished that there were words of pure hatred out of
which I might construct sentences like snakes, out of which I might
construct sentences with mouths fanged, that had forked tongues, out of
which I might construct sentences that writhed and and hissed; then I
could give my opinion of the rebels during the great struggle for the
preservation of this nation.Slavery in the Name of Religion

Just think of it!Our churches and best people, as they call themselves,
defending the institution of slavery.When I was a little boy I used
to see steamers go down the Mississippi river with hundreds of men and
women chained hand to hand, and even children, and men standing about
them with whips in their hands and pistols in their pockets in the name
of liberty, in the name of civilization and in the name of religion!I
used to hear them preach to these slaves in the South and the only text
they ever took was "Servants be obedient unto your masters."That was
the salutation of the most merciful God to a man whose back was bleeding
that was the salutation of the most merciful God to the slave-mother
bending over an empty cradle, to the woman from whose breast a child
had been stolen--"Servants be obedient unto your masters."That was
what they said to a man running for his life and for his liberty through
tangled swamps and listening to the baying of blood-hounds, and when
he listened for them the voice came from heaven:--"Servants be obedient
unto your masters."Think how we have crouched and cringed before wealth even!How
they used to cringe in old times before a man who was rich--there are so
many of them gone into bankruptcy lately that we are losing a little of
our fear.The Patrons of Slavery

It is not possible for the human imagination to conceive of the horrors
of slavery.It has left no possible wrong uncommitted, no possible crime
un-perpetrated.It has been practiced and defended by all nations in
some form.It has been defended
by nearly every pulpit.From the profits derived from the slave trade,
churches have been built, cathedrals reared and priests paid.Slavery
has been blessed by bishop, by cardinal and by pope.It has received the
sanction of statesmen, of kings, of queens.Clergymen have taken their part of the spoil, reciting passages
of scripture in its defense, and judges have taken their portion in the
name of equity and law.A <DW52> Man in Congress

The world has changed!I have had the supreme pleasure of seeing a
man--once a slave--sitting in the seat of his former master in the
Congress of the United States.When I saw that sight, my eyes were
filled with tears.I felt that we had carried out the Declaration of
Independence, that we had given reality to it, and breathed the breath
of life into every word.I felt that our flag would float over and
protect the <DW52> man and his little children--standing straight in
the sun--just the same as though he were white and worth a million!The Zig-zag Strip

I have some excuses to offer for the race to which I belong.My first
excuse is that this is not a very good world to raise folks in anyway.It is not very well adapted to raising magnificent people.There's only
a quarter of it land to start with.It is three times better for raising
fish than folks; and in that one-quarter of land there is not a tenth
part fit to raise people on.You can't raise people without a good
climate.You have got to have the right kind of climate, and you have
got to have certain elements in the soil or you can't raise good people.Do you know that there is only a little zig-zag strip around the world
within which have been produced all men of genius?Black People have Suffered Enough

In my judgment the black people have suffered enough.They have been
slaves for two hundred years.They have been owned two hundred years,
and, more than all, they have been compelled to keep the company of
those who owned them.Think of being compelled to keep the society of
the man who is stealing from you.Think of being compelled to live with
a man that stole your child from the cradle before your very eyes.Think
of being compelled to live with a thief all your life, to spend your
days with a white loafer, and to be under his control.The History of Civilization

The history of civilization is the history of the slow and painful
enfranchisement of the human race.In the olden times the family was a
monarchy, the father being the monarch.The mother and children were the
veriest slaves.The will of the father was the supreme law.He had the
power of life and death.It took thousands of years to civilize this
father, thousands of years to make the condition of the wife and mother
and children even tolerable.A few families constituted a tribe; the
tribe had a chief; the chief was a tyrant; a few tribes formed a nation;
the nation was governed by a king, who was also a tyrant.A strong
nation robbed, plundered and took captive the weaker ones.Is there, in the civilized world, to-day, a clergyman who believes
in the divinity of slavery?Does the Bible teach man to enslave his
brother?If it does, is it not blasphemous to say that it is inspired
of God?If you find the institution of slavery upheld in a book said
to have been written by God, what would you expect to find in a book
inspired by the devil?Would you expect to find that book in favor of
liberty?Modern Christians, ashamed of the God of the Old Testament,
endeavor now to show that slavery was neither commanded nor opposed by
Jehovah.Solemn Defiance

For my part, I never will, I never can, worship a God who upholds the
institution of slavery.I neither want his
heaven, nor fear his hell.The Soldiers of the Republic

The soldiers of the Republic were not seekers after vulgar glory.They
were not animated by the hope of plunder or the love of conquest.They
fought to preserve the blessings of liberty and that their children
might have peace.They were the defenders of humanity, the destroyers
of prejudice, the breakers of chains, and in the name of the future they
slew the monster of their time.They blotted from the statute books laws that
had been passed by hypocrites at the instigation of robbers, and tore
with indignant hands from the Constitution that infamous clause that
made men the catchers of their fellow men.They made it possible for
judges to be just, for statesmen to be human, and for politicians to be
honest.They broke the shackles from the limbs of slaves, from the souls
of martyrs, and from the Northern brain.They kept our country on the
map of the world and our flag in heaven.Seven long years of war--fighting for what?For the principle that
all men were created equal--a truth that nobody ever disputed except
a scoundrel; nobody in the entire history of this world.No man ever
denied that truth who was not a rascal, and at heart a thief; never,
never, and never will.Simply that in
America every man should have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.Nobody ever denied that except a villain; never, never.It has been denied by kings--they were thieves.It has been denied by
statesmen--they were liars.It has been denied by priests, by clergymen,
by cardinals, by bishops and by popes--they were hypocrites.For the idea that all political power is vested
in the great body of the people.They make all the money; do all the
work.They plow the land; cut down the forests; they produce everything
that is produced.Then who shall say what shall be done with what is
produced except the producer?The Revolution Consummated

The soldiers of the Republic finished what the soldiers of the
Revolution commenced.They relighted the torch that fell from their
august hands and filled the world again with light.The soldiers went home to their waiting wives, to their glad children,
and to the girls they loved--they went back to the fields, the shops and
mines.They were
as honest in peace as they had been brave in war.Mocking at poverty,
laughing at reverses, they made a friend of toil.They said: "We saved
the nation's life, and what is life without honor?"They worked and
wrought with all of labor's sons, that every pledge the nation gave
should be redeemed.And their great leader, having put a shining hand of
friendship--a girdle of clasped and happy hands--around the globe, comes
home and finds that every promise made in war has now the ring and gleam
of gold.Manhood worth more than Gold

We say in this country manhood is worth more than gold.We say in this
country that without liberty the Nation is not worth preserving.I
appeal to every laboring man, and I ask him, "Is there another country
on this globe where you can have your equal rights with others?"Now,
then, in every country, no matter how good it is, and no matter how bad
it is--in every country there is something worth preserving, and there
is something that ought to be destroyed.Now recollect that every voter
is in his own right a king; every voter in this country wears a crown;
every voter in this country has in his hands the scepter of authority;
and every voter, poor and rich, wears the purple of authority alike.Recollect it; and the man that will sell his vote is the man that
abdicates the American throne.Grander than the Greek, nobler than the Roman, the soldiers of the
republic, with patriotism as taintless as the air, battled for the
rights of others; for the nobility of labor; fought that mothers might
own their babes; that arrogant idleness should not scar the back of
patient toil, and that our country should not be a many-headed monster
made of warring States, but a Nation, sovereign, great and free.Blood
was water; money, leaves, and life was common air until one flag floated
over a republic without a master and without a slave.Let us Drink to the Living and the Dead

The soldiers of the Union saved the South as well as the North.Their victory made us free and rendered tyranny in
every other land as insecure as snow upon volcano lips.And now let us
drink to the volunteers, to those who sleep in unknown, sunken graves,
whose names are only in the hearts of those they loved and left--of
those who only hear in happy dreams the footsteps of return.Let us
drink to those who died where lipless famine mocked at want--to all the
maimed whose scars give modesty a tongue, to all who dared and gave to
chance the care and keeping of their lives--to all the living and all
the dead--to Sherman, to Sheridan and to Grant, the foremost soldiers of
the world; and last, to Lincoln, whose loving life, like a bow of peace,
spans and arches all the clouds of war.Will the Wounds of the War be Healed?There is still another question: "Will all the wounds of the war be
healed?"The Southern people must submit, not to the
dictation of the North, but to the nation's will and to the verdict of
mankind.They were wrong, and the time will come when they will say
that they have been vanquished by the right.Freedom conquered them, and
freedom will cultivate their fields, educate their children, weave for
them the robes of wealth, execute their laws, and fill their land with
happy homes.Saviours of the Nation

They rolled the stone from the sepulchre of progress, and found therein
two angels clad in shining garments--nationality and liberty.The
soldiers were the Saviours of the Nation.In writing the proclamation of emancipation, Lincoln, greatest
of our mighty dead, whose memory is as gentle as the summer air,--when
reapers sing'mid gathered sheaves,--copied with the pen what Grant and
his brave comrades wrote with swords.General Grant

When the savagery of the lash, the barbarism of the chain, and the
insanity of secession confronted the civilization of our century, the
question, "Will the great republic defend itself?"trembled on the
lips of every lover of mankind.The North, filled with intelligence and
wealth, products of liberty, marshalled her hosts and asked only for
a leader.From civil life a man, silent, thoughtful, poised, and calm;
stepped forth, and with the lips of victory voiced the nation's first
and last demand: "Unconditional and immediate surrender."From that
moment the end was known.That utterance was the real declaration of
real war and in accordance with the dramatic unities of mighty
events, the great soldier who made it, received the final sword of the
rebellion.The soldiers of the republic were not seekers after vulgar
glory; they were not animated by the hope of plunder or the love of
conquest.They fought to preserve the homestead of liberty.MONEY THAT IS MONEY




142.Paper is not Money

Some people tell me that the government can impress its sovereignty on
a piece of paper, and that is money.Well, if it is, what's the use of
wasting it making one dollar bills?It takes no more ink and no more
paper--why not make $1000 bills?Why not make $100,000,000 and all be
billionaires?If the government can make money, what on earth does it
collect taxes for you and me for?Why don't it make what money it wants,
take the taxes out, and give the balance to us?Greenbacker, suppose
the government issued $1,000,000,000 to-morrow, how would you get any of
it?The Debt will be paid

It will be paid.The holders of the debt have got a mortgage on a
continent.They have a mortgage on the honor of the Republican party,
and it is on record.Every blade of grass that grows upon this continent
is a guarantee that the debt will be paid; every field of bannered corn
in the great, glorious West is a guarantee that the debt will be paid;
all the coal put away in the ground, millions of years ago by the old
miser, the sun; is a guarantee that every dollar of that debt will be
paid; all the cattle on the prairies, pastures and plains, every one of
them is a guarantee that this debt will be paid; every pine standing
in the sombre forests of the North, waiting for the woodman's axe, is
a guarantee that this debt will be paid; all the gold and silver hid in
the Sierra Nevadas, waiting for the miner's pick, is a guarantee that
the debt will be paid; every locomotive, with its muscles of iron and
breath of flame, and all the boys and girls bending over their books at
school, every dimpled child in the cradle, every good man and every good
woman, and every man that votes the Republican ticket, is a guarantee
that the debt will be paid.No man can imagine, all the languages of the world cannot express, what
the people of the United States suffered from 1873 to 1879.Men who
considered themselves millionaires found that they were beggars; men
living in palaces, supposing they had enough to give sunshine to the
winter of their age, supposing they had enough to have all they loved
in affluence and comfort, suddenly found that they were mendicants with
bonds, stocks, mortgages, all turned to ashes in their aged, trembling
hands.The chimneys grew cold, the fires in furnaces went out, the poor
families were turned adrift, and the highways of the United States were
crowded with tramps.Into the home of the poor crept the serpent of
temptation, and whispered in the ear of poverty the terrible word
"repudiation."A Voter because a Man

A man does not vote in this country simply because he is rich; he does
not vote in this country simply because he has an education; he does
not vote simply because he has talent or genius; we say that he votes
because he is a man, and that he has his manhood to support; and we
admit in this country that nothing can be more valuable to any human
being than his manhood, and for that reason we put poverty on an
equality with wealth.If you are a German, recollect that this country is kinder to you than
your own fatherland,--no matter what country you came from, remember
that this country is an asylum, and vote as in your conscience you
believe you ought to vote to keep this flag in heaven.I beg every
American to stand with that part of the country that believes in law, in
freedom of speech, in an honest vote, in civilization, in progress, in
human liberty, and in universal justice.Prosperity and Resumption hand in hand

The Republicans of the United States demand a man who knows that
prosperity and resumption, when they come, must come together; that when
they come they will come hand in hand through the golden harvest fields;
hand in hand by the whirling spindles and the turning wheels; hand in
hand past the open furnace doors; hand in hand by the chimneys filled
with eager fire, greeted and grasped by the countless sons of toil.This money has to be dug out of the earth.You cannot make it by passing
resolutions in a political convention.Every Poor Man should Stand by the Government

It is the only Nation where the man clothed in a rag stands upon an
equality with the one wearing purple.It is the only country in the
world where, politically, the hut is upon an equality with the palace.For that reason, every poor man should stand by the government, and
every poor man who does not is a traitor to the best interests of his
children; every poor man who does not is willing his children should
bear the badge of political inferiority; and the only way to make this
government a complete and perfect success is for the poorest man to
think as much of his manhood as the millionaire does of his wealth.I want to tell you that you cannot conceive of what the American people
suffered as they staggered over the desert of bankruptcy from 1873 to
1879.We are too near now to know how grand we were.The poor mechanic said
"No;" the ruined manufacturer said "No;" the once millionaire said "No,
we will settle fair; we will agree to pay whether we ever pay or
not, and we will never soil the American name with the infamous word,
'repudiation.'"Are you not glad
that our flag is covered all over with financial honors?The stars shine
and gleam now because they represent an honest nation.A Government with a Long Arm

I believe in a Government with an arm long enough to reach the collar
of any rascal beneath its flag.I want it with an arm long enough and
a sword sharp enough to strike down tyranny wherever it may raise its
snaky head.I want a nation that can hear the faintest cries of its
humblest citizen.I want a nation that will protect a freedman standing
in the sun by his little cabin, just as quick as it would protect
Vanderbilt in a palace of marble and gold.No Repudiation

Then it was, that the serpent of temptation whispered in the ear of want
that dreadful word "Repudiation."They
appealed to want, to misery, to threatened financial ruin, to the bare
hearthstones, to the army of beggars, We had grandeur enough to say:
"No; we'll settle fair if we don't pay a cent!"Is there a Democrat now who wishes we had taken the advice of
Bayard to scale the bonds?Is there an American, a Democrat here, who
is not glad we escaped the stench and shame of repudiation, and did not
take Democratic advice?Is there a Greenbacker here who is not glad we
didn't do it?He may say he is, but he isn't.I think there is the greatest heroism in living for a thing!There's no
glory in digging potatoes.You don't wear a uniform when you're picking
up stones.You can't have a band of music when you dig potatoes!In,
1873 came the great crash.No one can estimate the anguish of that time!Millionaires found
themselves paupers.The aged man,
who had spent his life in hard labor, and who thought he had accumulated
enough to support himself in his old age, and leave a little something
to his children and grandchildren, found they were all beggars.The
highways were filled with tramps.Promises Don't Pay

If I am fortunate enough to leave a dollar when I die, I want it to be
a good one; I don't wish to have it turn to ashes in the hands of
widowhood, or become a Democratic broken promise in the pocket of the
orphan; I want it money.I saw not long ago a piece of gold bearing the
stamp of the Roman Empire.That Empire is dust, and over it has been
thrown the mantle of oblivion, but that piece of gold is as good as
though Julius Caesar were still riding at the head of the Roman Legion.I want money to that will outlive the Democratic party.They told
us--and they were honest about it--they said, "when we have plenty of
money we are prosperous."And I said: "When we are prosperous, then we
have credit, and, credit inflates the currency.Whenever a man buys a
pound of sugar and says, 'Charge it,' he inflates the currency; whenever
he gives his note, he inflates the currency; whenever his word takes the
place of money, he inflates the currency."The consequence is that when
we are prosperous, credit takes the place of money, and we have what
we call "plenty."But you can't increase prosperity simply by using
promises to pay.I do not wish to trust the wealth of this nation with the demagogues of
the nation.I do not wish to trust the wealth of the country to every
blast of public opinion.I want money as solid as the earth on which we
tread, as bright as the stars that shine above us.The South and the Tariff

Where did this doctrine of a tariff for revenue only come from?The South would like to stab the prosperity of the North.They
had rather trade with Old England than with New England.They had rather
trade with the people who were willing to help them in war than those
who conquered the rebellion.They knew what gave us our strength in
war.They knew all the brooks and creeks and rivers in New England were
putting down the rebellion.They knew that every wheel that turned,
every spindle that revolved, was a soldier in the army of human
progress.They were so lured by the greed of office that
they were willing to trade upon the misfortune of a nation.I don't wish to belong to a party that succeeds only when my country
falls.I don't wish to belong to a party whose banner went up with
the banner of rebellion.I don't wish to belong to a party that was in
partnership with defeat and disaster.I am for Protection

And I will tell you why I am for protection, too.If we were all farmers
we would be stupid.If we were all shoemakers we would be stupid.If
we all followed one business, no matter what it was, we would become
stupid.Protection to American labor diversifies American industry, and
to have it diversified touches and developes every part of the human
brain.Protection protects integrity; it protects intelligence; and
protection raises sense; and by protection we have greater men and
better-looking women and healthier children.Free trade means that our
laborer is upon an equality with the poorest paid labor of this world.The Old Woman of Tewksbury

You Greenbackers are like the old woman in the Tewksbury, Mass.,
Poor-House.She used to be well off, and didn't like her quarters.You
Greenbackers have left your father's house of many mansions and have fed
on shucks about long enough.The Supervisor came into the Poor-House one
day and asked the old lady how she liked it.She said she didn't like
the company, and asked him what he would advise her to do under similar
circumstances."Do you think anybody is ever prejudiced in their sleep?"I dreamed I died and went to
Heaven.A nice man came to me and asked
me where I was from.Says I, 'From Tewksbury, Mass.'He looked in his
book and said, 'You can't stay here.'"I asked what he would advise me
to do under similar circumstances."'Well,' he said, 'there's hell down
there, you might try that.'"Well, I went down there, and the men told
me my name wasn't on the book and I couldn't stay there.'Well,' said I,
'What would you advise me to do under similar circumstances?''Said he,
'You'll have to go back to Tewksbury.'And when Green-backers remember
what they once were, you must feel now, when you were forced to join
the Democratic party, as bad as the old lady who had to go back to
Tewksbury.American Muscle, Coined into Gold

I believe in American labor, and I tell you why.The other day a man
told me that we had produced in the United States of America one million
tons of rails.In other
words, the million tons are worth $60,000,000.How much is a ton of iron
worth in the ground?American labor takes 25 cents of
iron in the ground and adds to it $59.75.One million tons of rails, and
the raw material not worth $24,000.We build a ship in the United States
worth $500,000, and the value of the ore in the earth, of the trees in
the great forest, of all that enters into the composition of that ship
bringing $500,000 in gold is only $20,000; $480,000 by American labor,
American muscle, coined into gold; American brains made a legal-tender
the world around.Inflation

I don't blame the man who wanted inflation.I don't blame him for
praying for another period of inflation."When it comes," said the man
who had a lot of shrunken property on his hands, "blame me, if I don't
unload, you may shoot me."It's a good deal like the game of poker!I
don't suppose any of you know anything about that game!Along towards
morning the fellow who is ahead always wants another deal.The fellow
that is behind says his wife's sick, and he must go home.You ought
to hear that fellow descant on domestic virtue!And the other fellow
accuses him of being a coward and wanting to jump the game.A man whose
dead wood is hung up on the shore in a dry time, wants the water to rise
once more and float it out into the middle of the stream.We have fifty-six thousand
square miles of land--nearly thirty-six million acres.Upon these plains
we can raise enough to feed and clothe twenty million people.Beneath
these prairies were hidden, millions of ages ago, by that old miser, the
sun, thirty-six thousand square miles of coal.The aggregate thickness
of these veins is at least fifteen feet.Think of a column of coal one
mile square and one hundred miles high!What
a sunbeam such a column would be!Think of all this force, willed and
left to us by the dead morning of the world!Think of the fireside of
the future around which will sit the fathers, mothers and children of
the years to be!Think of the sweet and happy faces, the loving and
tender eyes that will glow and gleam in the sacred light of all these
flames!They say that money is a measure of value.A bushel doesn't
measure values.If it measured
values, a bushel of potatoes would be worth as much as a bushel of
diamonds.They used to say,
"there's no use in having a gold yard-stick."You
don't buy the yard-stick.If money bore the same relation to trade as
a yard-stick or half-bushel, you would have the same money when you
got through trading as you had when you begun.A man don't sell
half-bushels.All we want is a little sense about these
things.Some said there
wasn't enough money.That's so; I know what that means myself.They said
if we had more money we'd be more prosperous.The truth is, if we
were more prosperous we'd have more money.They said more money would
facilitate business.Money by Work

How do you get your money?You have got to dig it
out of the ground.In old times there were
some men who thought they could get some way to turn the baser metals
into gold, and old gray-haired men, trembling, tottering on the verge of
the grave, were hunting for something to turn ordinary metals into gold;
they were searching for the fountain of eternal youth, but they did not
find it.No human ear has ever heard the silver gurgle of the spring of
immortal youth.Meat Twice a Year

I have been in countries where the laboring man had meat once a year;
sometimes twice--Christmas and Easter.And I have seen women carrying
upon their heads a burden that no man would like to carry, and at the
same time knitting busily with both hands.And those women lived without
meat; and when I thought of the American laborer I said to myself,
"After all, my country is the best in the world."And when I came back
to the sea and saw the old flag flying in the air, it seemed to me as
though the air from pure joy had burst into blossom.America a Glorious Land

Labor has more to eat and more to wear in the United States than in
any other land of this earth.I want America to produce everything
that Americans need.I want it so if the whole world should declare war
against us, so if we were surrounded by walls of cannon and bayonets and
swords, we could supply all human wants in and of ourselves.I want to
live to see the American woman dressed in American silk; the American
man in everything from hat to boots produced in America by the cunning
hand of the American toiler.How to Spend a Dollar

If you have only a dollar in the world and have got to spend it, spend
it like a man; spend it like a prince, like a king!If you have to spend
it, spend it as though it were a dried leaf, and you were the owner of
unbounded forests.Honesty is Best always and Everywhere

I am next in favor of honest money.I am in favor of gold and silver,
and paper with gold and silver behind it.I believe in silver, because
it is one of the greatest of American products, and I am in favor of
anything that will add to the value of American products.But I want a
silver dollar worth a gold dollar, even if you make it or have to make
it four feet in diameter.No government can afford to be a clipper of
coin.A great Republic cannot afford to stamp a lie upon silver or gold.Honest money, an honest people, an honest Nation.When our money is only
worth 80 cents on the dollar, we feel 20 per cent, below par.When our
money is good we feel good.When our money is at par, that is where we
are.I am a profound believer in the doctrine that for nations as well
as men, honesty is the best, always, everywhere and forever.A Fountain of Greenbacks

There used to be mechanics that tried to make perpetual motion by
combinations of wheels, shifting weights, and rolling balls; but somehow
the machine would never quite run.A perpetual fountain of greenbacks,
of wealth without labor, is just as foolish as a fountain of eternal
youth.The idea that you can produce money without labor is just as
foolish as the idea of perpetual motion.They are old follies under new
names.We had to borrow some money to pay for shot and
shell to shoot Democrats with.We found that we could get along with a
few less Democrats, but not with any less country, and so we borrowed
the money, and the question now is, will we pay it?And which party is
the most apt to pay it, the Republican party, that made the debt--the
party that swore it was constitutional, or the party that said it was
unconstitutional?Whenever a Democrat sees a greenback, the greenback
says to the Democrat, "I am one of the fellows that whipped you."Whenever a Republican sees a greenback, the greenback says to him, "You
and I put down the rebellion and saved the country."Honest Methods

So many presidents of savings banks, even those belonging to the Young
Men's Christian Association, run off with the funds; so many railroad
and insurance companies are in the hands of receivers; there is so much
bankruptcy on every hand, that all capital is held in the nervous clutch
of fear.Slowly, but surely, we are coming back to honest methods in
business.Confidence will return, and then enterprise will unlock the
safe and money will again circulate as of yore; the dollars will leave
their hitting places, and every one will be seeking investment.For my part I do not ask any interference on the part of the government
except to undo the wrong it has done.I do not ask that money be made
out of nothing.I do not ask for the prosperity born of paper.But I do
ask for the remonetization of silver.It was an imposition upon every solvent man; a fraud upon every honest
debtor in the United States.It was done in the
interest of avarice and greed, and should be undone by honest men.RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS




171.Redden your hands with human blood; blast by slander the fair fame
of the innocent; strangle the smiling child upon its mother's knees;
deceive, ruin and desert the beautiful girl who loves and trusts you,
and your case is not hopeless.For all this, and for all these you
may be forgiven.For all this, and for all these, that bankrupt court
established by the gospel, will give you a discharge; but deny the
existence of these divine ghosts, of these gods, and the sweet and
tearful face of Mercy becomes livid with eternal hate.Heaven's golden
gates are shut, and you, with an infinite curse ringing in your
ears, with the brand of infamy upon your brow, commence your endless
wanderings in the lurid gloom of hell--an immortal vagrant--an eternal
outcast--a deathless convict.Faith--A Mixture of Insanity and Ignorance

The doctrine that future happiness depends upon belief is monstrous.It is the infamy of infamies.The notion that faith in Christ is to
be rewarded by an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon reason,
observation, and experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for
refutation, and can be relieved only by that unhappy mixture of insanity
and ignorance; called "faith."The church in the days of Voltaire contended that its servants were the
only legitimate physicians.The priests cured in the name of the church,
and in the name of God--by exorcism, relics, water, salt and oil.Gervasius was good for rheumatism, St.Ovidius
for deafness, St.Apollonia for
toothache, St.Clara for rheum in the eye, St.Devils were driven out with wax tapers, with incence (sp.), with holy
water, by pronouncing prayers.The church, as late as the middle of the
twelfth century, prohibited good Catholics from having anything to do
with physicians.The Sleep of Persecutors

All the persecutors sleep in peace, and the ashes of those who burned
their brothers in the name of Christ rest in consecrated ground.Whole
libraries could not contain even the names of the wretches who have
filled the world with violence and death in defense of book and creed,
and yet they all died the death of the righteous, and no priest or|
minister describes the agony and fear, the remorse and horror with which
their guilty souls were filled in the last moments of their lives.These
men had never doubted; they accepted the creed; they were not infidels;
they had not denied the divinity of Christ; they had been baptized;
they had partaken of the last supper; they had respected priests; they
admitted that the Holy Ghost had "proceeded;" and these things put
pillows beneath their dying heads and covered them with the drapery of
peace.There is no recorded instance where the uplifted hand of murder has been
paralyzed--no truthful account in all the literature of the world of the
innocent shielded by God.Thousands of crimes are being committed every
day--men are this moment lying in wait for their human prey; wives
are whipped and crushed, driven to insanity and death; little children
begging for mercy, lifting imploringly tear-filled eyes to the brutal
faces of fathers and mothers; sweet girls are deceived, lured, and
outraged; but God has no time to prevent these things--no time to defend
the good and to protect the pure.He is too busy numbering hairs and
watching sparrows.All kinds of criminals, except infidels, meet death with reasonable
serenity.As a rule, there is nothing in the death of a pirate to cast
any discredit on his profession.The murderer upon the scaffold, with
a priest on either side, smilingly exhorts the multitude to meet him in
heaven.The man who has succeeded in making his home a hell meets death
without a quiver, provided he has never expressed any doubt as to the
divinity of Christ or the eternal "procession" of the holy ghost.The
king who has waged cruel and useless war, who has filled countries with
widows and fatherless children, with the maimed and diseased, and who
has succeeded in offering to the Moloch of ambition the best and bravest
of his subjects, dies like a saint.The first Corpse and the first Cathedral

Now and then, in the history of this world, a man of genius, of sense,
of intellectual honesty has appeared.These men have denounced the
superstitions of their day.To see priests
devour the substance of the people filled them with indignation.These
men were honest enough to tell their thoughts.Then they were denounced,
condemned, executed.Some of them escaped the fury of the people who
loved their enemies, and died naturally in their beds.It would not be
for the church to admit that they died peacefully.That would show that
religion was not actually necessary in the last moment.Religion got
much of its power from the terror of death.Superstition is the child of
ignorance and fear.The first
corpse was the first priest.It would not do to have the common people
understand that a man could deny the Bible, refuse to look at the cross,
contend that Christ was only a man, and yet die as calmly as Calvin did
after he had murdered Servetus, or as King David, after advising one son
to kill another.The Sixteenth Century

In the sixteenth century every science was regarded as an outcast and an
enemy, and the church influenced the world, which was under its
power, to believe anything, and the ignorant mob was always too ready,
brutalized by the church, to hang, kill or crucify at their bidding.Such was the result of a few centuries of Christianity.An Orthodox Gentleman

By Orthodox I mean a gentleman who is petrified in his mind, whooping
around intellectually, simply to save the funeral expenses of his soul.A Bold Assertion

The churches point to their decayed saints, and their crumbled Popes
and say, "Do you know more than all the ministers that ever lived?"And without the slightest egotism or blush I say, yes, and the name of
Humboldt outweighs them all.The men who stand in the front rank, the
men who know most of the secrets of nature, the men who know most are
to-day the advanced infidels of this world.I have lived long enough to
see the brand of intellectual inferiority on every orthodox brain.If we admit that some infinite being has controlled the destinies of
persons and peoples, history becomes a most cruel and bloody farce.Age after age, the strong have trampled upon the weak; the crafty
and heartless have ensnared and enslaved the simple and innocent,
and nowhere, in all the annals of mankind, has any god succored the
oppressed.Weak ones Suffering--Heaven deaf

Most of the misery has been endured by the weak, the loving and the
innocent.Women have been treated like poisonous beasts, and little
children trampled upon as though they had been vermin.Numberless altars
have been reddened, even with the blood of babes; beautiful girls have
been given to slimy serpents; whole races of men doomed to centuries
of slavery, and everywhere there has been outrage beyond the power
of genius to express.During all these years the suffering have
supplicated; the withered lips of famine have prayed; the pale victims
have implored, and Heaven has been deaf and blind.Heaven has no Ear, no Hand

Man should cease to expect aid from on high.By this time he should know
that heaven has no ear to hear, and no hand to help.The present is the
necessary child of all the past.There has been no chance, and there can
be no interference.Religion is Tyrannical

Religion does not, and cannot, contemplate man as free.She accepts only
the homage of the prostrate, and scorns the offerings of those who stand
erect.The wide and sunny
fields belong not to her domain.The star-lit heights of genius and
individuality are above and beyond her appreciation and power.Her
subjects cringe at her feet, covered with the dust of obedience.Religion and Facts

What has religion to do with facts?Is there any such thing
as Methodist mathematics, Presbyterian botany, Catholic astronomy or
Baptist biology?What has any form of superstition or religion to do
with a fact or with any science?Nothing but hinder, delay or embarass.I want, then, to free the schools; and I want to free the politicians,
so that a man will not have to pretend he is a Methodist, or his wife
a Baptist, or his grandmother a Catholic; so that he can go through
a campaign, and when he gets through will find none of the dust of
hypocrisy on his knees.Religion not the End of Life

We deny that religion is the end or object of this life.When it is so
considered it becomes destructive of happiness--the real end of life.It becomes a hydra-headed monster, reaching in terrible coils from the
heavens, and thrusting its thousand fangs into the bleeding, quivering
hearts of men.It devours their substance, builds palaces for God, (who
dwells not in temples made with hands,) and allows his children to
die in huts and hovels.It fills the earth with mourning, heaven with
hatred, the present with fear, and all the future with despair.Creeds

Just in proportion that the human race has advanced, the Church has lost
power.No nation ever materially
advanced that held strictly to the religion of its founders.No nation
ever gave itself wholly to the control of the Church without losing its
power, its honor, and existence.Every Church pretends to have found
the exact truth.Every creed is a rock in running
water; humanity sweeps by it.Every creed cries to the universe, "Halt!"A creed is the ignorant Past bullying the enlightened Present.The Worst Religion in the World

The worst religion of the world was the Presbyterianism of Scotland as
it existed in the beginning of the eighteenth century.The kirk had all
the faults of the church of Rome, without a redeeming feature.The kirk
hated music, painting, statuary, and architecture.Anything touched with
humanity--with the dimples of joy--was detested and accursed.God was
to be feared, not loved.Happiness was a snare, and human love was wicked,
weak, and vain.The Presbyterian priest of Scotland was as cruel,
bigoted, and heartless as the familiar of the inquisition.In the beginning of this, the nineteenth century, a boy
seventeen years of age, Thomas Aikenhead, was indicted and tried
at Edinburgh for blasphemy.He had on several occasions, when cold,
jocularly wished himself in hell, that he might get warm.The poor,
frightened boy recanted--begged for mercy; but he was found guilty,
hanged, thrown in a hole at the foot of the scaffold; and his weeping
mother vainly begged that his bruised and bleeding body might be given
to her.Religion Demanding Miracles

The founder of a religion must be able to turn water into wine--cure
with a word the blind and lame, and raise with a simple touch the dead
to life.It was necessary for him to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of his barbarian disciple, that he was superior to nature.In times of
ignorance this was easy to do.The credulity of the savage was almost
boundless.To him the marvelous was the beautiful, the mysterious was
the sublime.Consequently, every religion has for its foundation a
miracle--that is to say, a violation of nature--that is to say, a
falsehood.We Want One Fact

We have heard talk enough.We have listened to all the drowsy, idealess,
vapid sermons that we wish to hear.We have read your Bible and the
works of your best minds.We have heard your prayers, your solemn groans
and your reverential amens.We beg at the doors of your churches for just one little
fact.We pass our hats along your pews and under your pulpits and
implore you for just one fact.We know all about your mouldy wonders and
your stale miracles.The Design Argument

These religious people see nothing but designs everywhere, and personal,
intelligent interference in everything.They insist that the universe
has been created, and that the adaptation of means to ends is perfectly
apparent.They point us to the sunshine, to the flowers, to the April
rain, and to all there is of beauty and of use in the world.Did it ever
occur to them that a cancer is as beautiful in its development as is the
reddest rose?That what they are pleased to call the adaptation of
means to ends, is as apparent in the cancer as in the April rain?By what ingenious methods the
blood is poisoned so that the cancer shall have food!By what wonderful
contrivances the entire system of man is made to pay tribute to this
divine and charming cancer!See by what admirable instrumentalities it
feeds itself from the surrounding quivering, dainty flesh!See how it
gradually but surely expands and grows!By what marvelous mechanism
it is supplied with long and slender roots that reach out to the most
secret nerves of pain for sustenance and life!Down, Forever Down

Down, forever down, with any religion that requires upon its ignorant
altar the sacrifice of the goddess Reason, that compels her to abdicate
forever the shining throne of the soul, strips from her form the
imperial purple, snatches from her hand the sceptre of thought and makes
her the bondwoman of a senseless faith!The Back

Upon this rack I have described, this victim was placed, and those
chains were attached to his ankles and then to his waist, and clergyman,
good men pious men!men that were shocked at the immorality of their
day!they talked about playing cards and the horrible crime of dancing!how such things shocked them; men going to the theatres and seeing a
play written by the grandest genius the world ever has produced--how it
shocked their sublime and tender souls!but they commenced turning this
machine and they kept on turning until the ankles, knees, hips, elbows,
shoulders and wrists were all dislocated and the victim was red with the
sweat of agony, and they had standing by a physician to feel the pulse,
so that the last faint flutter of life would not leave his veins.simply that they might
have the pleasure of racking him once again.That is the spirit, and it
is a spirit born of the doctrine that there is upon the throne of the
universe a being who will eternally damn his children, and they said:
"If God is going to have the supreme happiness of burning them forever,
certainly he might not to begrudge to us the joy of burning them for an
hour or two."That was their doctrine, and when I read these things it
seems to me that I have suffered them myself.An Awful Admission

Just think of going to the day of judgment, if there is one, and
standing up before God and admitting without a blush that you had lived
and died a Scotch Presbyterian.I would expect the next sentence would
be, "Depart ye curged into everlasting fire."CHURCHES AND PRIESTS




195.The Church Forbids Investigation

The first doubt was the womb and cradle of progress, and from the first
doubt, man has continued to advance.Men began to investigate, and the
church began to oppose.The astronomer scanned the heavens, while the
church branded his grand forehead with the word, "Infidel;" and now,
not a glittering star in all the vast expanse bears a Christian name.In spite of all religion, the geologist penetrated the earth, read her
history in books of stone, and found, hidden within her bosom souvenirs
of all the ages.The Church Charges Falsely

Notwithstanding the fact that infidels in all ages have battled for
the rights of man, and have at all times been the fearless advocates
of liberty and justice, we are constantly charged by the Church with
tearing down without building again.The Church in the "Dark Ages"

During that frightful period known as the "Dark Ages," Faith reigned,
with scarcely a rebellious subject.Her temples were "carpeted with
knees," and the wealth of nations adorned her countless shrines.The
great painters prostituted their genius to immortalize her vagaries,
while the poets enshrined them in song.At her bidding, man covered the
earth with blood.The scales of Justice were turned with her gold, and
for her use were invented all the cunning instruments of pain.She built
cathedrals for God, and dungeons for men.She peopled the clouds with
angels and the earth with slaves.For ages, a deadly conflict has been waged between a few brave men and
women of thought and genius upon the one side, and the great ignorant
religious mass on the other.The few have appealed to reason, to honor, to law, to freedom, to the
known, and to happiness here in this world.The many have appealed
to prejudice, to fear, to miracle, to slavery, to the unknown, and
to misery hereafter.The many have said,
"Believe!"The Church and the Tree of Knowledge

The gods dreaded education and knowledge then just as they do now.The
church still faithfully guards the dangerous tree of knowledge, and has
exerted in all ages her utmost power to keep mankind from eating the
fruit thereof.The priests have never ceased repeating the old falsehood
and the old threat: "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye die."Let the church, or one of its
intellectual saints, perform a miracle, and we will believe.We are told
that nature has a superior.Let this superior, for one single instant,
control nature and we will admit the truth of your assertions.The Heretics Cried, "Halt!"A few infidels--a few heretics cried, "Halt!"to the great rabble of
ignorant devotion, and made it possible for the genius of the nineteenth
century to revolutionize the cruel creeds and superstitions of mankind.The World not so Awful Flat

According to the Christian system this world was the centre of
everything.The stars were made out of what little God happened to have
left when he got the world done.God lived up in the sky, and they said
this earth must rest upon something, and finally science passed its hand
clear under, and there was nothing.It was self-existent in infinite
space.Then the Church began to say they didn't say it was flat, not so
awful flat--it was kind of rounding.According to the ancient Christians God lived from all eternity, and
never worked but six days in His whole life, and then had the impudence
to tell us to be industrious.Christian nations are the warlike nations of this world.Christians have
invented the most destructive weapons of war.Christianity gave us the
revolver, invented the rifle, made the bombshell; and Christian
nations here and there had above all other arts the art of war; and as
Christians they have no respect for the rights of barbarians or for the
rights of any nation or tribe that happens to differ with them.See what
it does in our society; we are divided off into little sects that used
to discuss these questions with fire and sword, with chain and <DW19>,
and that discuss, some of them, even to-day, with misrepresentation and
slander.Every day something happens to show me that the old spirit that
that was in the inquisition still slumbers in the breasts of men.Another Day of Divine Work

I heard of a man going to California over the plains, and there was a
clergyman on board, and he had a great deal to say, and finally he
fell in conversation with the forty-niner, and the latter said to the
clergyman, "Do you believe that God made this world in six days?"They were then going along the Humboldt.Says he, "Don't you think
he could put in another day to advantage right around here?"The Donkey and the Lion

Owing to the attitude of the churches for the last fifteen hundred
years, truth-telling has not been a very lucrative business.As a rule,
hypocrisy has worn the robes, and honesty the rags.You cannot now answer the argument of a man by pointing at
the holes in his coat.Thomas Paine attacked the Church when it was
powerful--when it had what is called honors to bestow--when it was
the keeper of the public conscience--when it was strong and cruel.The
Church waited till he was dead, and then attacked his reputation and his
clothes.Once upon a time a donkey kicked a lion, but the lion was dead.The Orthodox Christian

The highest type of the orthodox Christian does not forget; neither
does he learn.He is a living fossil
embedded in that rock called faith.He makes no effort to better his
condition, because all his strength is exhausted in keeping other people
from improving theirs.The supreme desire of his heart is to force all
others to adopt his creed, and in order to accomplish this object he
denounces free-thinking as a crime, and this crime he calls heresy.When
he had power, heresy was the most terrible and formidable of words.It
meant confiscation, exile, imprisonment, torture, and death.Alms-Dish and Sword

I will not say the Church has been an unmitigated evil in all respects.It has delighted in the production
of extremes.It has furnished murderers for its own martyrs.It has
sometimes fed the body, but has always starved the soul.It has been a
charitable highwayman--a profligate beggar--a generous pirate.It
has produced some angels and a multitude of devils.It has built more
prisons than asylums.It made a hundred orphans while it cared for one.In one hand it has carried the alms-dish and in the other a sword.The Church the Great Robber

The Church has been, and still is, the great robber.She has rifled not
only the pockets but the brains of the world.She is the stone at the
sepulchre of liberty; the upas tree, in whose shade the intellect of man
has withered; the Gorgon beneath whose gaze the human heart has turned
to stone.Under her influence even the Protestant mother expects to be
happy in heaven, while her brave boy, who fell fighting for the rights
of man, shall writhe in hell.The Church Impotent

The Church, impotent and malicious, regrets, not the abuse, but the loss
of her power, and seeks to hold by falsehood what she gained by cruelty
and force, by fire and fear.Christianity cannot live in peace with any
other form of faith.Toleration

Let it be remembered that all churches have persecuted heretics to the
extent of their power.Toleration has increased only when and where the
power of the church has diminished.From Augustine until now the
spirit of the Christians has remained the same.There has been the same
intolerance, the same undying hatred of all who think for themselves,
and the same determination to crush out of the human brain all knowledge
inconsistent with an ignorant creed.Shakespeare's Plays v. Sermons

What would the church people think if the theatrical people should
attempt to suppress the churches?What harm would it do to have an opera
here tonight?It would elevate us more than to hear ten thousand sermons
on the worm that never dies.There is more practical wisdom in one of
the plays of Shakespeare than in all the sacred books ever written.What
wrong would there be to see one of those grand plays on Sunday?There
was a time when the church would not allow you to cook on Sunday.You
had to eat your victuals cold.There was a time they thought the more
miserable you feel the better God feels.Give any orthodox church the power, and to-day they would punish heresy
with whip, and chain, and fire.As long as a church deems a certain
belief essential to salvation, just so long it will kill and burn if it
has the power.Why should the Church pity a man whom her God hates?Why
should she show mercy to a kind and noble heretic whom her God will burn
in eternal fire?Cathedrals and domes, and chimes and chants--temples frescoed and
groined and carved, and gilded with gold--altars and tapers, and
paintings of virgin and babe--censer and chalice--chasuble, paten
and alb--organs, and anthems and incense rising to the winged and
blest--maniple, amice and stole--crosses and crosiers, tiaras
and crowns--mitres and missals and masses--rosaries, relics and
robes--martyrs and saints, and windows stained as with the blood of
Christ--never, never for one moment awed the brave, proud spirit of the
Infidel.He knew that all the pomp and glitter had been purchased with
Liberty--that priceless jewel of the soul.In looking at the cathedral
he remembered the dungeon.The music of the organ was loud enough to
drown the clank of fetters.He could not forget that the taper had
lighted the fagot.He knew that the cross adorned the hilt of the sword,
and so where others worshiped, he wept and scorned.Back to Chaos

Suppose the Church could control the world today, we would go back to
chaos and old night philosophy would be branded as infamous; science
would again press its pale and thoughtful face against the prison bars,
and round the limbs of liberty would climb the bigot's flame.Infinite Impudence of the Church

Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church assuming to think for
the human race?Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church
that pretends to be the mouthpiece of God, and in his name threatens to
inflict eternal punishment upon those who honestly reject its claims and
scorn its pretensions?By what right does a man, or an organization
of men, or a god, claim to hold a brain in bondage?When a fact can be
demonstrated, force is unnecessary; when it cannot be demonstrated, an
appeal to force is infamous.In the presence of the unknown all have an
equal right to think.Wanted!--A New Method

The world is covered with forts to protect Christians from Christians,
and every sea is covered with iron monsters ready to blow Christian
brains into eternal froth.Millions upon millions are annually expended
in the effort to construct still more deadly and terrible engines of
death.Industry is crippled, honest toil is robbed, and even beggary is
taxed to defray the expenses of Christian warfare.There must be some
other way to reform this world.The Kirk of Scotland

The Church was ignorant, bloody, and relentless.In Scotland the "Kirk"
was at the summit of its power.It was a full sister of the Spanish
Inquisition.It was the enemy of
happiness, the hater of joy, and the despiser of religious liberty.It
taught parents to murder their children rather than to allow them to
propagate error.If the mother held opinions of which the infamous
"Kirk" disapproved, her children were taken from her arms, her babe from
her very bosom, and she was not allowed to see them, or to write them a
word.It would not allow shipwrecked sailors to be rescued from drowning
on Sunday.It sought to annihilate pleasure, to pollute the heart by
filling it with religious cruelty and gloom, and to change mankind into
a vast horde of pious, heartless fiends.One of the most famous Scotch
divines said: "The Kirk holds that religious toleration is not far from
blasphemy."The Church Looks Back

The Church is, and always has been, incapable of a forward movement.The Church has already reduced Spain to a
guitar, Italy to a hand-organ, and Ireland to exile.Diogenes

The Church used painting, music and architecture, simply to degrade
mankind.There have been at all
times brave spirits that dared even the gods.Some proud head has always
been above the waves.In every age some Diogenes has sacrificed to all
the gods.True genius never cowers, and there is always some Samson
feeling for the pillars of authority.The Church and War

It does seem as though the most zealous Christian must at times
entertain some doubt as to the divine origin of his religion.For
eighteen hundred years the doctrine has been preached.For more than
a thousand years the Church had, to a great extent, the control of the
civilized world, and what has been the result?Are the Christian nations
patterns of charity and forbearance?On the contrary, their principal
business is to destroy each other.More than five millions of Christians
are trained, educated, and drilled to murder their fellow-christians.Every nation is groaning under a vast debt incurred in carrying on war
against other Christians.The Call to Preach

An old deacon, wishing to get rid of an unpopular preacher, advised him
to give up the ministry and turn his attention to something else.The
preacher replied that he could not conscientiously desert the pulpit, as
he had had a "call" to the ministry.To which the deacon replied, "That
may be so, but it's very unfortunate for you, that when God called you
to preach, he forgot to call anybody to hear you."Burning Servetus

The maker of the Presbyterian creed caused the fugitive Servetus to be
arrested for blasphemy.He was
convicted and condemned to death by fire.On the morning of the fatal
day, Calvin saw him, and Servetus, the victim, asked forgiveness of
Calvin, the murderer.Servetus was bound to the stake, and the <DW19>s
were lighted.The wind carried the flames somewhat away from his body,
so that he slowly roasted for hours.Vainly he implored a speedy death.At last the flames climbed round his form; through smoke and fire his
murderers saw a white, heroic face.And there they watched until a man
became a charred and shriveled mass.Liberty was banished from Geneva,
and nothing but Presbyterianism was left.Freedom for the Clergy

One of the first things I wish to do is to free the orthodox clergy.I
am a great friend of theirs, and in spite of all they may say against
me, I am going to do them a great and lasting service.Upon their necks
are visible the marks of the collar, and upon their backs those of the
lash.They are not allowed to read and think for themselves.They are
taught like parrots, and the best are those who repeat, with the fewest
mistakes, the sentences they have been taught.They sit like owls upon
some dead limb of the tree of knowledge, and hoot the same old hoots
that have been hooted for eighteen hundred years.The Pulpit Weakening

There was a time when a falsehood, fulminated from the pulpit, smote
like a sword; but, the supply having greatly exceeded the demand,
clerical misrepresentation has at last become almost an innocent
amusement.Remembering that only a few years ago men, women, and even
children, were imprisoned, tortured and burned, for having expressed
in an exceedingly mild and gentle way, the ideas entertained by me, I
congratulate myself that calumny is now the pulpit's last resort.Origin of the Priesthood

This was the origin of the priesthood.The priest pretended to stand
between the wrath of the gods and the helplessness of man.He was man's
attorney at the court of heaven.He carried to the invisible world a
flag of truce, a protest and a request.He came back with a command,
with authority and with power.Man fell upon his knees before his own
servant, and the priest, taking advantage of the awe inspired by his
supposed influence with the gods, made of his fellow-man a cringing
hypocrite and slave.The Clergy on Heaven

The clergy, however, balance all the real ills of this life with the
expected joys of the next.We are assured that all is perfection in
heaven--there the skies are cloudless--there all is serenity and peace.Here empires may be overthrown; dynasties may be extinguished in blood;
millions of slaves may toil 'neath the fierce rays of the sun, and the
cruel strokes of the lash; yet all is happiness in heaven.Pestilences
may strew the earth with corpses of the loved; the survivors may bend
above them in agony--yet the placid bosom of heaven is unruffled.Children may expire vainly asking for bread; babes may be devoured by
serpents, while the gods sit smiling in the clouds.The Parson, the Crane and the Fish

A devout clergyman sought every opportunity to impress upon the mind
of his son the fact, that God takes care of all his creatures; that the
falling sparrow attracts his attention, and that his loving-kindness is
over all his works.Happening, one day, to see a crane wading in quest
of food, the good man pointed out to his son the perfect adaptation of
the crane to get his living in that manner."See," said he, "how his
legs are formed for wading!Observe how
nicely he folds his feet when putting them in or drawing them out of
the water!He is thus enabled
to approach the fish without giving them any notice of his arrival.My son," said he, "it is impossible to look at that bird without
recognizing the design, as well as the goodness of God, in thus
providing the means of subsistence.""Yes," replied the boy, "I think I
see the goodness of God, at least so far as the crane is concerned; but,
after all, father, don't you think the arrangement a little tough on the
fish?"Give me the storm of tempest and action, rather than the dead calm of
ignorance and faith.Banish me from Eden when you will; but first let me
eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge!The Pulpit's Cry of Fear

From every pulpit comes the same cry, born of the same fear: "Lest
they eat and become as gods, knowing good and evil."For this reason,
religion hates science, faith detests reason, theology is the sworn
enemy of philosophy, and the church with its flaming sword still guards
the hated tree, and like its supposed founder, curses to the lowest
depths the brave thinkers who eat and become as gods.Restive Clergymen

Some of the clergy have the independence to break away, and the
intellect to maintain themselves as free men, but the most are compelled
to submit to the dictation of the orthodox, and the dead.They are
not employed to give their thoughts, but simply to repeat the ideas of
others.They are not expected to give even the doubts that may suggest
themselves, but are required to walk in the narrow, verdureless path
trodden by the ignorance of the past.The forests and fields on either
side are nothing to them.The Parson Factory at Andover

They have in Massachusetts, at a place called Andover, a kind of
minister-factory; and every professor in that factory takes an oath once
in every five years--that is as long as an oath will last--that not only
has he not during the last five years, but so help him God, he will not
during the next five years intellectually advance; and probably there is
no oath he could easier keep.Since the foundation of that institution
there has not been one case of perjury.They believe the same creed they
first taught when the foundation stone was laid, and now when they send
out a minister they brand him as hardware from Sheffield and Birmingham.And every man who knows where he was educated knows his creed, knows
every argument of his creed, every book that he reads, and just what he
amounts to intellectually, and knows he will shrink and shrivel.A Charge to Presbyteries

Go on, presbyteries and synods, go on!Thrust the heretics out of the
Church--that is to say, throw away your brains,--put out your eyes.Every
deserter from your camp is a recruit for the army of progress.Cling to
the ignorant dogmas of the past; read the 109th Psalm; gloat over the
slaughter of mothers and babes; thank God for total depravity; shower
your honors upon hypocrites, and silence every minister who is touched
with that heresy called genius.Turn out the
astronomers, the geologists, the naturalists, the chemists, and all the
honest scientists.With a whip of scorpions, drive them all out.Nature the True Bible

The true Bible appeals to man in the name of demonstration.It has no fear of being read, of being contradicted,
of being investigated and understood.It does not pretend to be holy, or
sacred; it simply claims to be true.It challenges the scrutiny of
all, and implores every reader to verify every line for himself.It is
incapable of being blasphemed.This book appeals to all the surroundings
of man.Each thing that exists testifies of its perfection.The earth,
with its heart of fire and crowns of snow; with its forests and plains,
its rocks and seas; with its every wave and cloud; with its every leaf
and bud and flower, confirms its every word, and the solemn stars,
shining in the infinite abysses, are the eternal witnesses of its truth.Inspiration

I will tell you what I mean by inspiration.I go and look at the sea,
and the sea says something to me; it makes an impression upon my mind.That impression depends, first, upon my experience; secondly, upon
my intellectual capacity.He has a
different brain, he has had a different experience, he has different
memories and different hopes.The sea may speak to him of joy and to me
of grief and sorrow.The sea cannot tell the same thing to two beings,
because no two human beings have had the same experience.So, when I
look upon a flower, or a star, or a painting, or a statue, the more I
know about sculpture the more that statue speaks to me.The more I have
had of human experience, the more I have read, the greater brain I have,
the more the star says to me.In other words, nature says to me all that
I am capable of understanding.Think of a God wicked and malicious enough to inspire this prayer in
the 109th Psalm.Had this
inspired psalm been found in some temple erected for the worship of
snakes, or in the possession of some cannibal king, written with blood
upon the dried skins of babes, there would have been a perfect harmony
between its surroundings and its sentiments.I Don't Believe the Bible

Now, I read the Bible, and I find that God so loved this world that he
made up his mind to damn the most of us.I have read this book, and what
shall I say of it?I believe it is generally better to be honest.Now,
I don't believe the Bible.They say that if you
do you will regret it when you come to die.If that be true, I know a
great many religious people who will have no cause to regret it--they
don't tell their honest convictions about the Bible.The Bible the Real Persecutor

The Bible was the real persecutor.The Bible burned heretics, built
dungeons, founded the Inquisition, and trampled upon all the liberties
of men.How long, O how long will mankind worship a book?How long will
they grovel in the dust before the ignorant legends of the barbaric
past?How long, O how long will they pursue phantoms in a darkness
deeper than death?Immoralities of the Bible

The believers in the Bible are loud in their denunciation of what they
are pleased to call the immoral literature of the world; and yet few
books have been published containing more moral filth than this inspired
word of God.These stories are not redeemed by a single flash of wit or
humor.They never rise above the dull details of stupid vice.For one,
I cannot afford to soil my pages with extracts from them; and all such
portions of the Scriptures I leave to be examined, written upon, and
explained by the clergy.Clergymen may know some way by which they can
extract honey from these flowers.Until these passages are expunged from
the Old Testament, it is not a fit book to be read by either old or
young.It contains pages that no minister in the United States would
read to his congregation for any reward whatever.There are chapters
that no gentleman would read in the presence of a lady.There are
chapters that no father would read to his child.There are narratives
utterly unfit to be told; and the time will come when mankind will
wonder that such a book was ever called inspired.The Bible Stands in the Way

But as long as the Bible is considered as the work of God, it will be
hard to make all men too good and pure to imitate it; and as long as it
is imitated there will be vile and filthy books.The literature of
our country will not be sweet and clean until the Bible ceases to be
regarded as the production of a god.The Bible False

In the days of Thomas Paine the Church believed and taught that every
word in the Bible was absolutely true.Since his day it has been proven
false in its cosmogony, false in its astronomy, false in its chronology,
false in its history, and so far as the Old Testament is concerned,
false in almost everything.There are but few, if any, scientific men
who apprehend that the Bible is literally true.Who on earth at this
day would pretend to settle any scientific question by a text from
the Bible?The old belief is confined to the ignorant and zealous.The Church itself will before long be driven to occupy the position of
Thomas Paine.The Man I Love

I love any man who gave me, or helped to give me, the liberty I enjoy
to-night.I love every man who helped put our flag in heaven.I love
every man who has lifted his voice in all the ages for liberty, for a
chainless body, and a fetterless brain.I love every man who has given
to every other human being every right that he claimed for himself.I
love every man who thought more of principle than he did of position.I
love the men who have trampled crowns beneath their feet that they might
do something for mankind.Whale, Jonah and All

The best minds of the orthodox world, to-day, are endeavoring to prove
the existence of a personal Deity.You are no longer asked to swallow the Bible whole, whale,
Jonah and all; you are simply required to believe in God, and pay your
pew-rent.There is not now an enlightened minister in the world who will
seriously contend that Samson's strength was in his hair, or that the
necromancers of Egypt could turn water into blood, and pieces of wood
into serpents.Damned for Laughing at Samson

For my part, I would infinitely prefer to know all the results of
scientific investigation, than to be inspired as Moses was.Supposing
the Bible to be true; why is it any worse or more wicked for free
thinkers to deny it, than for priests to deny the doctrine of Evolution,
or the dynamic theory of heat?Why should we be damned for laughing at
Samson and his foxes, while others, holding the Nebular Hypothesis in
utter contempt, go straight to heaven?The Man, Not the Book, Inspired

Now when I come to a book, for instance I read the writings of
Shakespeare--Shakespeare, the greatest human being who ever existed upon
this globe.All that I have sense enough to
understand.Let another read him who knows
nothing of the drama, who knows nothing of the impersonation of passion;
what does he get from him?In other words, every man gets
from a book, a flower, a star, or the sea, what he is able to get from
his intellectual development and experience.Do you then believe that
the Bible is a different book to every human being that receives it?Can God, then, through the Bible, make the same revelation to two
men?Because the man who reads is the man who inspires.Inspiration is in the man and not in the book.The Bible a Chain

The real oppressor, enslaver and corrupter of the people is the Bible.That book is the chain that binds, the dungeon that holds the clergy.That book spreads the pall of superstition over the colleges and
schools.That book puts out the eyes of science, and makes honest
investigation a crime.That book unmans the politician and degrades the
people.That book fills the world with bigotry, hypocrisy and fear.Absurd and Foolish Fables

Volumes might be written upon the infinite absurdity of this most
incredible, wicked and foolish of all the fables contained in that
repository of the impossible, called the Bible.To me it is a matter
of amazement, that it ever was for a moment believed by any intelligent
human being.The Bible the Work of Man

Is it not infinitely more reasonable to say that this book is the work
of man, that it is filled with mingled truth and error, with mistakes
and facts, and reflects, too faithfully perhaps, the "very form and
pressure of its time?"If there are mistakes in the Bible, certainly
they were made by man.If there is anything contrary to nature, it
was written by man.If there is anything immoral, cruel, heartless
or infamous, it certainly was never written by a being worthy of the
adoration of mankind.Something to Admire, not Laugh at

It strikes me that God might write a book that would not necessarily
excite the laughter of his children.In fact, I think it would be
safe to say that a real God could produce a work that would excite the
admiration of mankind.An Intellectual Deformity

The man who now regards the Old Testament as, in any sense, a sacred or
inspired book, is, in my judgment, an intellectual and moral deformity.There is in it so much that is cruel, ignorant, and ferocious, that it
is to me a matter of amazement that it was ever thought to be the work
of a most merciful Deity.The Bible a Poor Product

Admitting that the Bible is the Book of God, is that his only good job?Will not a man be damned as quick for denying the equator as denying
the Bible?Will he not be damned as quick for denying geology as for
denying the scheme of salvation?When the Bible was first written it was
not believed.Had they known as much about science as we know now, that
Bible would not have been written.The Bible the Battle Ground of Sects

Every sect is a certificate that God has not plainly revealed his will
to man.To each reader the Bible conveys a different meaning.About the
meaning of this book, called a revelation, there have been ages of war,
and centuries of sword and flame.If written by an infinite God, he must
have known that these results must follow; and thus knowing, he must be
responsible for all.The Bible Childish

Paine thought the barbarities of the Old Testament inconsistent with
what he deemed the real character of God.He believed that murder,
massacre and indiscriminate slaughter had never been commanded by
the Deity.He regarded much of the Bible as childish, unimportant
and foolish.Paine
attacked the Bible precisely in the same spirit in which he had attacked
the pretensions of kings.All the pomp in the
world could not make him cower.His reason knew no "Holy of Holies,"
except the abode of Truth.Where Moses got the Pentateuch

Nothing can be clearer than that Moses received from the Egyptians the
principal parts of his narrative, making such changes and additions as
were necessary to satisfy the peculiar superstitions of his own people.God's Letter to His Children

According to the theologians, God, the Father of us all, wrote a letter
to his children.The children have always differed somewhat as to the
meaning of this letter.In consequence of these honest differences,
these brothers began to cut out each other's hearts.In every land,
where this letter from God has been read, the children to whom and for
whom it was written have been filled with hatred and malice.They have
imprisoned and murdered each other, and the wives and children of each
other.Mary went back to the bedroom.In the name of God every possible crime has been committed, every
conceivable outrage has been perpetrated.Brave men, tender and loving
women, beautiful girls, and prattling babes have been exterminated in
the name of Jesus Christ.Examination a Crime

The Church has burned honesty and rewarded hypocrisy.And all this,
because it was commanded by a book--a book that men had been taught
implicitly to believe, long before they knew one word that was in it.They had been taught that to doubt the truth of this book--to examine
it, even--was a crime of such enormity that it could not be forgiven,
either in this world or in the next.All that is necessary, as it seems to me, to convince any reasonable
person that the Bible is simply and purely of human invention--of
barbarian invention--is to read it.Read it as you would any other book;
think of it as you would any other; get the bandage of reverence from
your eyes; drive from your heart the phantom of fear; push from the
throne of your brain the cowled form of superstition--then read the Holy
Bible, and you will be amazed that you ever, for one moment, supposed a
being of infinite wisdom, goodness and purity, to be the author of such
ignorance and such atrocity.An Infallible Book Makes Slaves

Whether the Bible is false or true, is of no consequence in comparison
with the mental freedom of the race.Salvation from slavery is inestimable.As long as man
believes the Bible to be infallible, that book is his master.The
civilization of this century is not the child of faith, but of
unbelief--the result of free thought.Can a Sane Man Believe in Inspiration?What man who ever thinks, can believe that blood can appease God?And
yet our entire system of religion is based on that belief.The Jews
pacified Jehovah with the blood of animals, and according to the
Christian system, the blood of Jesus softened the heart of God a little,
and rendered possible the salvation of a fortunate few.It is hard to
conceive how any sane man can read the Bible and still believe in the
doctrine of inspiration.An Inspiration Test

The Bible was originally written in the Hebrew language, and the Hebrew
language at that time had no vowels in writing.It was written entirely
with consonants, and without being divided into chapters and verses, and
there was no system of punctuation whatever.After you go home to-night
write an English sentence or two with only consonants close together,
and you will find that it will take twice as much inspiration to read it
as it did to write it.The Real Bible

The real Bible is not the work of inspired men, nor prophets, nor
evangelists, nor of Christs.The real Bible has not yet been written,
but is being written.Every man who finds a fact adds a word to this
great book.The Bad Passages in the Bible not Inspired

The bad passages in the Bible are not inspired.No God ever upheld
human slavery, polygamy or a war of extermination.No God ever ordered
a soldier to sheathe his sword in the breast of a mother.No God ever
ordered a warrior to butcher a smiling, prattling babe.No God ever said, be subject to the powers that be.No
God ever endeavored to make man a slave and woman a beast of burden.There are thousands of good passages in the Bible.There are in it wise laws, good customs, some lofty and splendid things.And I do not care whether they are inspired or not, so they are true.But what I do insist upon is that the bad is not inspired.Too much Pictorial

There is no hope for you.It is just as bad to deny hell as it is to
deny heaven.The Garden of Eden is pictorial; a pictorial snake and
a pictorial woman, I suppose, and a pictorial man, and may be it was a
pictorial sin.One Plow worth a Million Sermons

Man must learn to rely upon himself.Reading Bibles will not protect
him from the blasts of winter, but houses, fire and clothing will.To
prevent famine one plow is worth a million sermons, and even patent
medicines will cure more diseases than all the prayers uttered since the
beginning of the world.The Infidels of 1776

By the efforts of these infidels--Paine, Jefferson and Franklin--the
name of God was left out of the Constitution of the United States.They
knew that if an infinite being was put in, no room would be left for the
people.They knew that if any church was made the mistress of the state,
that mistress, like all others, would corrupt, weaken, and destroy.Washington wished a church, established by law, in Virginia.He was
prevented by Thomas Jefferson.It was only a little while ago that
people were compelled to attend church by law in the Eastern States,
and taxes were raised for the support of churches the same as for the
construction of highways and bridges.The great principle enunciated
in the Constitution has silently repealed most of these laws.In the
presence of this great instrument the constitutions of the States grew
small and mean, and in a few years every law that puts a chain upon the
mind, except in Delaware, will be repealed, and for these our children
may thank the infidels of 1776.The Legitimate Influence of Religion

Religion should have the influence upon mankind that its goodness, that
its morality, its justice, its charity, its reason and its argument give
it, and no more.Religion should have the effect upon mankind that it
necessarily has, and no more.Infidels the Flowers of the World

The infidels have been the brave and thoughtful men; the flower of all
the world; the pioneers and heralds of the blessed day of liberty and
love; the generous spirits of the unworthy past; the seers and
prophets of our race; the great chivalric souls, proud victors on the
battle-fields of thought, the creditors of all the years to be.The Noblest Sons of, Earth

Who at the present day can imagine the courage, the devotion to
principle, the intellectual and moral grandeur it once required to be an
infidel, to brave the Church, her racks, her fagots, her dungeons, her
tongues of fire--to defy and scorn her heaven and her hell--her devil
and her God?They were the noblest sons of earth.They were the real
saviors of our race, the destroyers of superstition, and the creators
of Science.They were the real Titans who bared their grand foreheads to
all the thunderbolts of all the gods.How Ingersoll became an Infidel

I may say right here that the Christian idea that any God can make me
His friend by killing mine is about as great a mistake as could be made.They seem to have the idea that just as soon as God kills all the people
that a person loves, he will then begin to love the Lord.What drew
my attention first to these questions was the doctrine of eternal
punishment.This was so abhorrent to my mind that I began to hate the
book in which it was taught.Then, in reading law, going back to find
the origin of laws, I found one had to go but a little way before the
legislator and priest united.This led me to study a good many of the
religions of the world.At first I was greatly astonished to find most
of them better than ours.I then studied our own system to the best of
my ability, and found that people were palming off upon children
and upon one another as the inspired words of God a book that upheld
slavery, polygamy, and almost every other crime.Whether I am right or
wrong, I became convinced that the Bible is not an inspired book, and
then the only question for me to settle was as to whether I should say
what I believed or not.This realty was not the question in my mind,
because, before even thinking of such a question, I expressed my belief,
and I simply claim that right, and expect to exercise it as long as I
live.I may be damned for it in the next world, but it is a great source
of pleasure to me in this.Why should it be taken for granted that the men who devoted their lives
to the liberation of their fellowmen should have been hissed at in
the hour of death by the snakes of conscience, while men who defended
slavery--practiced polygamy--justified the stealing of babes from the
breasts of mothers, and lashed the naked back of unpaid labor, are
supposed to have passed smilingly from earth to the embraces of the
angels?Why should we think that the brave thinkers, the investigators,
the honest men must have left the crumbling shore of time in dread and
fear, while the instigators of the massacre of St.Bartholomew, the
inventors and users of thumb screws, of iron boots and racks, the
burners and tearers of human flesh, the stealers, the whippers, and the
enslavers of men, the buyers and beaters of maidens, mothers, and babes,
the founders of the inquisition, the makers of chains, the builders of
dungeons, the calumniators of the living, the slanderers of the
dead, and even the murderers of Jesus Christ, all died in the odor of
sanctity, with white, forgiven hands folded upon the breasts of peace,
while the destroyers of prejudice, the breakers of fetters, the creators
of light, died surrounded by the fierce fiends of God?Infidelity is Liberty

Infidelity is liberty; all religion is slavery.In every creed man is
the slave of God--woman is the slave of man and the sweet children are
the slaves of all.We do not want creeds; we want knowledge--we want
happiness.The World in Debt to Infidels

What would the world be if infidels had never been?Did all the priests of Rome increase the mental wealth of man as much
as Bruno?Did all the priests of France do as great a work for the
civilization of the world as Diderot and Voltaire?Did all the ministers
of Scotland add as much to the sum of human knowledge as David Hume?Have all the clergymen, monks, friars, ministers, priests, bishops,
cardinals, and popes, from the day of Pentecost to the last election,
done as much for human liberty as Thomas Paine?Infidels the Pioneers of Progress

The history of intellectual progress is written in the lives of
infidels.Political rights have been preserved by traitors--the liberty
of the mind by heretics.To attack the king was treason--to dispute the
priest was blasphemy.The throne and the altar were twins--vultures from the same
egg.It was James I. who said: "No bishop, no king."He might have said:
"No cross, no crown."The king owned the bodies, and the priest the
souls, of men.One lived on taxes, the other on alms.One was a robber,
the other a beggar.The king made laws, the priest made creeds.With bowed backs the people
received the burdens of the one, and, with wonder's open mouth, the
dogmas of the other.If any aspired to be free, they were slaughtered by
the king, and every priest was a Herod who slaughtered the children
of the brain.The king ruled by force, the priest by fear, and both by
both.The king said to the people: "God made you peasants, and He made
me king.He made rags and hovels for you, robes and palaces for me.And the priest said: "God made you ignorant and
vile.If you do not obey me, God will punish
you here and torment you hereafter.Infidels the Great Discoverers

Infidels are the intellectual discoverers.They sail the unknown seas,
and in the realms of thought they touch the shores of other worlds.An
infidel is the finder of a new fact--one who in the mental sky has seen
another star.He is an intellectual capitalist, and for that reason
excites the envy of theological paupers.The Altar of Reason

Virtue is a subordination, of the passions to the intellect.It is to
act in accordance with your highest convictions.It does not consist in
believing, but in doing.This is the sublime truth that the Infidels in
all ages have uttered.They have handed the torch from one to the other
through all the years that have fled.Upon the altar of reason they have
kept the sacred fire, and through the long midnight of faith they fed
the divine flame.GODS AND DEVILS




275.Every Nation has Created a God

Each nation has created a God, and the God has always resembled his
creators.He hated and loved what they hated and loved.Each God was
intensely patriotic, and detested all nations but his own.All these
gods demanded praise, flattery and worship.Most of them were pleased
with sacrifice, and the smell of innocent blood has ever been considered
a divine perfume.All these gods have insisted on having a vast number
of priests, and the priests have always insisted upon being supported
by the people; and the principle business of these priests has been
to boast that their God could easily vanquish all the other gods put
together.Gods with Back-Hair

Man, having always been the physical superior of woman, accounts for
the fact that most of the high gods have been males.Had women been the
physical superior; the powers supposed to be the rulers of Nature would
have been woman, and instead of being represented in the apparel of man,
they would have luxuriated in trains, low-necked dresses, laces and
back-hair.Creation the Decomposition of the Infinite

Admitting that a god did create the universe, the question then arises,
of what did he create it?Nothing,
considered in the light of a raw material, is a most decided failure.It
follows, then, that the god must have made the universe out of himself,
he being the only existence.The universe is material, and if it was
made of god, the god must have been material.With this very thought in
his mind, Anaximander of Miletus, said: "Creation is the decomposition
of the infinite."The Gods Are as the People Are

No god was ever in advance of the nation that created him.The <DW64>s
represented their deities with black skins and curly hair: The Mongolian
gave to his a yellow complexion and dark almond-shaped eyes.The Jews
were not allowed to paint theirs, or we should have seen Jehovah with
a full beard, an oval face, and an aquiline nose.Zeus was a perfect
Greek, and Jove looked as though a member of the Roman senate.The gods
of Egypt had the patient face and placid look of the loving people who
made them.The gods of northern countries were represented warmly clad
in robes of fur; those of the tropics were naked.The gods of India
were often mounted upon elephants; those of some islanders were great
swimmers, and the deities of the Arctic zone were passionately fond of
whale's blubber.Gods Shouldn't Make Mistakes

Generally the devotee has modeled them after himself, and has given them
hands, heads, feet, eyes, ears, and organs of speech.Each nation made
its gods and devils not only speak its language, but put in their mouths
the same mistakes in history, geography, astronomy, and in all matters
of fact, generally made by the people.Miracles

No one, in the world's whole history, ever attempted to substantiate a
truth by a miracle.Nothing but
falsehood ever attested itself by signs and wonders.No miracle ever was
performed, and no sane man ever thought he had performed one, and until
one is performed, there can be no evidence of the existence of any power
superior to, and independent of nature.Plenty of Gods on Hand

Man has never been at a loss for gods.He has worshipped almost
everything, including the vilest and most disgusting beasts.He has
worshipped fire, earth, air, water, light, stars, and for hundreds, of
ages prostrated himself before enormous snakes.Savage tribes often make
gods of articles they get from civilized people.The Todas worship
a cowbell.The Kodas worship two silver plates, which they regard as
husband and wife, and another tribe manufactured a god out of a king of
hearts.The Devil Difficulty

In the olden times the existence of devils was universally admitted.The
people had no doubt upon that subject, and from such belief it followed
as a matter of course, that a person, in order to vanquish these devils,
had either to be a god, or to be assisted by one.All founders of
religions have established their claims to divine origin by controlling
evil spirits, and suspending the laws of nature.Casting out devils was
a certificate of divinity.A prophet, unable to cope with the powers of
darkness, was regarded with contempt.The utterance of the highest and
noblest sentiments, the most blameless and holy life, commanded but
little respect, unless accompanied by power to work miracles and command
spirits.If he was God, of course
the devil knew that fact, and yet, according to this account, the devil
took the omnipotent God and placed him upon a pinnacle of the temple,
and endeavored to induce him, to dash himself against the earth.Failing
in that, he took the creator, owner and governor of the universe up into
an exceeding high mountain, and offered him this world--this grain of
sand--if he, the God of all the worlds, would fall down and worship
him, a poor devil, without even a tax title to one foot of dirt!Is it
possible the devil was such an idiot?Should any great credit be given
to this deity for not being caught with such chaff?The
devil--the prince of sharpers--the king of cunning--the master of
finesse, trying to bribe God with a grain of sand that belonged to God!Industrious Deities

Few nations have been so poor as to have but one god.Gods were made
so easily, and the raw material cost so little, that generally the god
market was fairly glutted, and heaven crammed with these phantoms.These
gods not only attended to the skies, but were supposed to interfere in
all the affairs of men.All was supposed to be under their
immediate control.Nothing was too small--nothing too large; the falling
of sparrows and the motions of the planets were alike attended to by
these industrious and observing deities.God in Idleness

If a god created the universe, then, there must have been a time when he
commenced to create.Back of that time there must have been an eternity,
during which there had existed nothing--absolutely nothing--except this
supposed god.According to this theory, this god spent an eternity, so
to speak, in an infinite vacuum, and in perfect idleness.Fancy a Devil Drowning a World

One of these gods, according to the account, drowned an entire world,
with the exception of eight persons.The old, the young, the beautiful
and the helpless were remorselessly devoured by the shoreless sea.This,
the most fearful tragedy that the imagination of ignorant priests ever
conceived, was the act, not of a devil, but of a god, so-called, whom
men ignorantly worship unto this day.What a stain such an act would
leave upon the character of a devil!Some Gods Very Particular About Little Things

From their starry thrones they frequently came to the earth for the
purpose of imparting information to man.It is related of one that he
came amid thunderings and lightnings in order to tell the people that
they should not cook a kid in its mother's milk.Some left their shining
abodes to tell women that they should, or should not, have children, to
inform a priest how to cut and wear his apron, and to give directions as
to the proper manner of cleaning the intestines of a bird.288 The Gods of To-day the Scorn of To-morrow

Nations, like individuals, have their periods of youth, of manhood and
decay.The same inexorable destiny awaits them
all.The gods created by the nations must perish with their creators.They were created by men, and like men, they must pass away.The deities
of one age are the by-words of the next.No Evidence of a God in Nature

The best minds, even in the religious world, admit that in the material
nature there is no evidence of what they are pleased to call a god.They find their evidence in the phenomena of intelligence, and very
innocently assert that intelligence is above, and in fact, opposed to
nature.They insist that man, at least, is a special creation; that
he has somewhere in his brain a divine spark, a little portion of the
"Great First Cause."They say that matter cannot produce thought; but
that thought can produce matter.They tell us that man has intelligence,
and therefore there must be an intelligence greater than his.Why not
say, God has intelligence, therefore there must be an intelligence
greater than his?So far as we know, there is no intelligence apart
from matter.We cannot conceive of thought, except as produced within a
brain.Great Variety in Gods

Gods have been manufactured after numberless models., and according to
the most grotesque fashions.Some have a thousand arms, some a hundred
heads, some are adorned with necklaces of living snakes, some are armed
with clubs, some with sword and shield, some with bucklers, and some
have wings as a cherub; some were invisible, some would show themselves
entire, and some would only show their backs; some were jealous, some
were foolish, some turned themselves into men, some into swans, some
into bulls, some into doves, and some into Holy-Ghosts, and made love
to the beautiful daughters of men: Some were married--all ought to have
been--and some were considered as old bachelors from all eternity.Some
had children, and the children were turned into gods and worshiped as
their fathers had been.Most of these gods were revengeful, savage,
lustful, and ignorant.As they generally depended upon their priests for
information, their ignorance can hardly excite our astonishment.God Grows Smaller

"But," says the religionist, "you cannot explain everything; and that
which you cannot explain, that which you do not comprehend, is my God."We are understanding more every day;
consequently your God is growing smaller every day.Give the Devil His Due

If the account given in Genesis is really true, ought we not, after all,
to thank this serpent?He was the first schoolmaster, the first advocate
of learning, the first enemy of ignorance, the first to whisper in human
ears the sacred word liberty, the creator of ambition, the author of
modesty, of inquiry, of doubt, of investigation, of progress and of
civilization.Casting out Devils

Even Christ, the supposed son of God, taught that persons were possessed
of evil spirits, and frequently, according to the account, gave proof of
his divine origin and mission by frightening droves of devils out of his
unfortunate countrymen.Casting out devils was his principal employment,
and the devils thus banished generally took occasion to acknowledge him
as the true Messiah; which was not only very kind of them, but quite
fortunate for him.On the Horns of a Dilemma

The history of religion is simply the story of man's efforts in all ages
to avoid one of two great powers, and to pacify the other.Both powers
have inspired little else than abject fear.The cold, calculating sneer
of the devil, and the frown of God, were equally terrible.In any event,
man's fate was to be arbitrarily fixed forever by an unknown power
superior to all law, and to all fact.The Devil and the Swine

How are you going to prove a miracle?How would you go to work to prove
that the devil entered into a drove of swine?Who saw it, and who would
know a devil if he did see him?Some tell me that it is the desire of God that I should worship Him?If he is in want and I can assist Him and will
not, I would be an ingrate and an infamous wretch.But I am satisfied
that I cannot by any possibility assist the infinite.I can help feed the hungry, clothe the naked, enlighten
ignorance.I can help at least, in some degree, toward covering this
world with a mantle of joy I may be wrong, but I do not believe that
there is any being in this universe who gives rain for praise, who gives
sunshine for prayer, or who blesses a man simply because he kneels.If the infinite "Father" allows a majority of his children to live in
ignorance and wretchedness now, what evidence is there that he will ever
improve their condition?Can the conduct
of infinite wisdom, power and love ever change?Is the infinite capable
of any improvement whatever?According to the theologians, God prepared this globe expressly for the
habitation of his loved children, and yet he filled the forests with
ferocious beasts; placed serpents in every path; stuffed the world
with earthquakes, and adorned its surface with mountains of flame.Notwithstanding all this, we are told that the world is perfect; that
it was created by a perfect being, and is therefore necessarily perfect.The next moment, these same persons will tell us that the world was
cursed; covered with brambles, thistles and thorns, and that man was
doomed to disease and death, simply because our poor, dear mother ate an
apple contrary to the command of an arbitrary God.The Devils better than the Gods

Our ancestors not only had their God-factories, but they made devils
as well.These devils were generally disgraced and fallen gods.These
devils generally sympathized with man.In nearly all the theologies,
mythologies and religions, the devils have been much more humane and
merciful than the gods.No devil ever gave one of his generals an order
to kill children and to rip open the bodies of pregnant women.Such
barbarities were always ordered by the good gods!The pestilences were
sent by the most merciful gods!The frightful famine, during which the
dying child with pallid lips sucked the withered bosom of a dead
mother, was sent by the loving gods.No devil was ever charged with such
fiendish brutality.Is it possible that an infinite God created this world simply to be the
dwelling-place of slaves and serfs?simply for the purpose of raising
orthodox Christians?That he did a few miracles to astonish them; that
all the evils of life are simply his punishments, and that he is finally
going to turn heaven into a kind of religious museum filled with Baptist
barnacles, petrified Presbyterians and Methodist mummies?I want no
heaven for which I must give my reason; no happiness in exchange for
my liberty, and no immortality that demands the surrender of my
individuality.Better rot in the windowless tomb, to which there is no
door but the red mouth of the pallid worm, than wear the jeweled collar
even of a god.It is impossible to conceive of a more thoroughly despicable, hateful,
and arrogant being, than the Jewish god.In the mythology of the world he has no parallel.He, only, is
never touched by agony and tears.He cares neither for love nor music,
beauty nor joy.A false friend, an unjust judge, a braggart, hypocrite,
and tyrant.Compared with Jehovah, Pharaoh was a benefactor, and the
tyranny of Egypt was freedom to those who suffered the liberty of God.HEAVEN AND HELL




302.Hope of a Future Life

For my part I know nothing of any other state of existence, either
before or after this, and I have never become personally acquainted with
anybody who did.There may be another life, and if there is the best
way to prepare for it is by making somebody happy in this.God certainly
cannot afford to put a man in hell who has made a little heaven in this
world.I would like to see how things come
out in this world when I am dead.There are some people I should like to
see again, but if there is no other life I shall never know it.I am Immortal

So far as I am concerned I am immortal; that is to say, I can't
recollect when I did not exist, and there never will be a time when I
will remember that I do not exist.I would like to have several millions
of dollars, and I may say I have a lively hope that some day I may be
rich; but to tell you the truth I have very little evidence of it.Our
hope of immortality does not come from any religions, but nearly all
religions come from that hope.The Old Testament, instead of telling
us that we are immortal, tells us how we lost immortality.You will
recollect that if Adam and Eve could have gotten to the tree of life,
they would have eaten of its fruit and would have lived forever; but for
the purpose of preventing immortality God turned them out of the Garden
of Eden, and put certain angels with swords or sabres at the gate to
keep them from getting back.The Old Testament proves, if it proves
anything, which I do not think it does, that there is no life after
this; and the New Testament is not very specific on the subject.There
were a great many opportunities for the Savior and his apostles to
tell us about another world, but they didn't improve them to any great
extent; and the only evidence so far as I know about another life is,
first, that we have no evidence; and, secondly, that we are rather sorry
that we have not, and wish we had.And suppose, after all, that death does end all.Next to eternal joy,
next to being forever with those we love and those who have loved us,
next to that is to be wrapped in the dreamless drapery of eternal peace.Upon the shadowy shore of death
the sea of trouble casts no wave.Eyes that have been curtained by the
everlasting dark will never know again the touch of tears.Lips that
have been touched by the eternal silence will never utter another word
of grief.And I had
rather think of those I have loved, and those I have lost, as having
returned to earth, as having become a part of the elemental wealth of
the the world.I would rather think of them as unconscious dust.I would
rather think of them as gurgling in the stream, floating in the cloud,
bursting into light upon the shores of worlds.I would rather think
of them thus than to have even a suspicion that their souls had been
clutched by an orthodox God.The Old World Ignorant of Destiny

Moses differed from most of the makers of sacred books by his failure
to say anything of a future life, by failing to promise heaven, and to
threaten hell.Upon the subject of a future state, there is not one
word in the Pentateuch.Probably at that early day God did not deem
it important to make a revelation as to the eternal destiny of man.He seems to have thought that he could control the Jews, at least, by
rewards and punishments in this world, and so he kept the frightful
realities of eternal joy and torment a profound secret from the people
of his choice.He thought it far more important to tell the Jews their
origin than to enlighten them as to their destiny.Where the Doctrine of Hell was born

I honestly believe that the doctrine of hell was born in the glittering
eyes of snakes that run in frightful coils watching for their prey.I
believe it was born in the yelping and howling and growling and snarling
of wild beasts.I believe it was born in the grin of hyenas and in the
malicious clatter of depraved apes.I despise it, I defy it, and I hate
it; and when the great ship freighted with the world goes down in
the night of death, chaos and disaster, I will not be guilty of the
ineffable meanness of pushing from my breast my wife and children and
paddling off in some orthodox canoe.I will go down with those I love
and with those who love me.I will go down with the ship and with my
race.Nothing can make me believe that there is any being that is going to
burn and torment and damn his children forever.The Grand Companionships of Hell

Since hanging has got to be a means of grace, I would prefer hell.I had
a thousand times rather associate with the pagan philosophers than with
the inquisitors of the middle ages.I certainly should prefer the worst
man in Greek or Roman history to John Calvin, and I can imagine no man
in the world that I would not rather sit on the same bench with than the
puritan fathers and the founders of orthodox churches.I would trade off
my harp any minute for a seat in the other country.All the poets will
be in perdition, and the greatest thinkers, and, I should think, most
of the women whose society would tend to increase the happiness of
man, nearly all the painters, nearly all the sculptors, nearly all
the writers of plays, nearly all the great actors, most of the best
musicians, and nearly all the good fellows--the persons who know good
stories, who can sing songs, or who will loan a friend a dollar.They will mostly all be in that country, and if I did not live there
permanently, I certainly would want it so I could spend my winter months
there.Let me put one case and I will be through with this branch of the
subject.The husband is a good
fellow and the wife a splendid woman.They live and love each other and
all at once he is taken sick, and they watch day after day and night
after night around his bedside until their property is wasted and
finally she has to go to work, and she works through eyes blinded with
tears, and the sentinel of love watches at the bedside of her prince,
and at the least breath or the least motion she is awake; and she
attends him night after night and day after day for years, and finally
he dies, and she has him in her arms and covers his wasted face with the
tears of agony and love.He dies, and
she buries him and puts flowers above his grave, and she goes there in
the twilight of evening and she takes her children, and tells her little
boys and girls through her tears how brave and how true and how tender
their father was, and finally she dies and goes to hell, because she was
not a believer; and he goes to the battlements of heaven and looks over
and sees the woman who loved him with all the wealth of her love, and
whose tears made his dead face holy and sacred, and he looks upon her
in the agonies of hell without having his happiness diminished in the
least.With all due respect to everybody I say, damn any such doctrine
as that.The Drama of Damnation

When you come to die, as you look back upon the record of your life, no
matter how many men you have wrecked and ruined, and no matter how many
women you have deceived and deserted--all that may be forgiven you;
but if you recollect that you have laughed at God's book you will see
through the shadows of death, the leering looks of fiends and the forked
tongues of devils.For instance, it
is the day of judgment.When the man is called up by the recording
secretary, or whoever does the cross-examining, he says to his soul:
"Where are you from?""Well, I don't like to talk about myself.""Well, I was a good fellow; I loved
my wife; I loved my children.My home was my heaven; my fireside was my
paradise, and to sit there and see the lights and shadows falling on the
faces of those I love, that to me was a perpetual joy.I never gave one
of them a solitary moment of pain.I don't owe a dollar in the world,
and I left enough to pay my funeral expenses and keep the wolf of want
from the door of the house I loved.That is the kind of a man I am."They were always expecting to be happy simply because somebody else was
to be damned.""Well, did you believe that rib story?"To tell you the
God's truth, that was a little more than I could swallow.""Yes, sir, and to the Young Men's Christian
Association.""Did you
ever run off with any of the money?""I don't like to tell, sir.""What kind of a bank did you have?""How much did you
run off with?""Did you take anything
else along with you?""Did you have a wife and children of your own?""Oh, yes; but such was my confidence in God that I
believed he would take care of them."I believed all of it, sir; I often used to be sorry that there were
not harder stories yet in the Bible, so that I could show what my faith
could do."Annihilation rather than be a God

No God has a right to make a man he intends to drown.Eternal wisdom has
no right to make a poor investment, no right to engage in a speculation
that will not finally pay a dividend.No God has a right to make
a failure, and surely a man who is to be damned forever is not a
conspicuous success.Yet upon love's breast, the Church has placed that
asp; around the child of immortality the Church has coiled the worm that
never dies.For my part I want no heaven, if there is to be a hell.I
would rather be annihilated than be a god and know that one human soul
would have to suffer eternal agony."All that have Red Hair shall be Damned."I admit that most Christians are honest--always have admitted it.I
admit that most ministers are honest, and that they are doing the best
they can in their way for the good of mankind; but their doctrines are
hurtful; they do harm in the world; and I am going to do what I can
against their doctrines.They preach this infamy: "He that believes
shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned."Every word
of that text has been an instrument of torture; every letter in that
text has been a sword thrust into the bleeding and quivering heart of
man; every letter has been a dungeon; every line has been a chain; and
that infamous sentence has covered this world with blood.I deny that
"whoso believes shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be
damned."No man can control his belief; you might as well say, "All that
have red hair shall be damned."The Conscience of a Hyena

But, after all, what I really want to do is to destroy the idea of
eternal punishment.That
doctrine fills hell with honest men, and heaven with intellectual and
moral paupers.That doctrine allows people to sin on a credit.That
doctrine allows the basest to be eternally happy and the most honorable
to suffer eternal pain.I think of all doctrines it is the most
infinitely infamous, and would disgrace the lowest savage, and any man
who believes it, and has imagination enough to understand it, has the
heart of a serpent and the conscience of a hyena.I Leave the Dead

But for me I leave the dead where nature leaves them, and whatever
flower of hope springs up in my heart I will cherish.But I cannot
believe that there is any being in this universe who has created a
soul for eternal pain, and I would rather that every God would destroy
himself, I would rather that we all should go back to the eternal chaos,
to the black and starless night, than that just one soul should suffer
eternal agony.Swedenborg did one thing for which I feel almost grateful.He gave an
account of having met John Calvin in hell.Nothing connected with the
supernatural could be more natural than this.The only thing detracting
from the value of this report is, that if there is a hell, we know
without visiting the place that John Calvin must be there.GOVERNING GREAT MEN




315.Jesus Christ

And let me say here once for all, that for the man Christ I have
infinite respect.Let me say once for all that the place where man has
died for man is holy ground.Let me say once for all, to that great and
serene man I gladly pay--I _gladly_ pay the tribute of my admiration and
my tears.He was an infidel in his
time.He was regarded as a blasphemer, and his life was destroyed by
hypocrites who have in all ages done what they could to trample freedom
out of the human mind.Had I lived at that time I would have been his
friend.And should he come again he will not find a better friend than
I will be.For the theological creation I have
a different feeling.If he was in fact God, he knew there was no such
thing as death; he knew that what we call death was but the eternal
opening of the golden gates of everlasting joy.And it took no heroism
to face a death that was simply eternal life.The Emperor Constantine, who lifted Christianity into power, murdered
his wife Fausta and his eldest son Crispus the same year that he
convened the council of Nice to decide whether Jesus Christ was a man or
the son of God.The council decided that Christ was substantial with
the Father.We are thus indebted to a wife
murderer for settling the vexed question of the divinity of the Savior.Theodosius called a council at Constantinople in 381, and this council
decided that the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father.Theodosius,
the younger, assembled another council at Ephesus to ascertain who the
Virgin Mary really was, and it was solemnly decided in the year 431 that
she was the mother of God.In 451 it was decided by a council held at
Chalcedon, called together by the Emperor Marcian, that Christ had two
natures--the human and divine.In 680, in another general council, held
at Constantinople, convened by order of Pognatius, it was also decided
that Christ had two wills, and in the year 1274 it was decided at the
council of Lyons that the Holy Ghost proceeded not only from the Father,
but from the Son as well.Had it not been for these councils we might
have been without a trinity even unto this day.When we take into
consideration the fact that a belief in the trinity is absolutely
essential to salvation, how unfortunate it was for the world that this
doctrine was not established until the year 1274.Think of the millions
that dropped into hell while these questions were being discussed.The church never has pretended that Jefferson or Franklin died in fear.Franklin wrote no books against the fables of the ancient Jews.He
thought it useless to cast the pearls of thought before the swine of
ignorance and fear.He was the father of a
great party.He gave his views in letters and to trusted friends.He
was a Virginian, author of the Declaration of Independence, founder of a
university, father of a political party, President of the United States,
a statesman and philosopher.He was too powerful for the churches of
his day.Paine was a foreigner, a citizen of the world.He had done these things openly, and what
he had said could not be answered.His arguments were so good that his
character was bad.The Emperor, stained with every crime, is supposed to have died like a
Christian.We hear nothing of fiends leering at him in the shadows of
death.He does not see the forms of his murdered wife and son covered
with the blood he shed.From his white and shriveled lips issued no
shrieks of terror.He does not cover his glazed eyes with thin and
trembling hands to shut out the visions of hell.His chamber is filled
with the rustle of wings waiting to bear his soul to the thrilling
realms of joy.Against the Emperor Constantine the church has hurled no
anathema.She has accepted the story of his vision in the clouds, and
his holy memory has been guarded by priest and pope.Diderot

Diderot was born in 1713.His parents were in what may be called the
humbler walks of life.Like Voltaire, he was educated by the Jesuits.He
had in him something of the vagabond, and was for several years almost a
beggar in Paris.He was endeavoring to live by his pen.In that day and
generation a man without a patron, endeavoring to live by literature,
was necessarily almost a beggar.He nearly starved--frequently going
for days without food.Afterward, when he had something himself, he was
generous as the air.No man ever was more willing to give, and no man
less willing to receive, than Diderot.His motto was, "Incredulity
is the first step toward philosophy."He had the vices of most
Christians--was nearly as immoral as the majority of priests.His vices
he shared in common--his virtues were his own--All who knew him united
in saying that he had the pity of a woman, the generosity of a prince,
the self-denial of an anchorite, the courage of Caesar, an insatiate
thirst foi knowledge, and the enthusiasm of a poet.He attacked with
every power of his mind the superstition of his day.He was in favor of universal
education--the church despised it.He wished to put the knowledge of
the whole world within reach of the poorest.He wished to drive from
the gate of the Garden of Eden the cherubim of superstition, so that
the child of Adam might return to eat once more the fruit of the tree
of knowledge.His poor little desk was
ransacked by the police, searching for manuscripts in which something
might be found that would justify the imprisonment of such a dangerous
man.Whoever, in 1750, wished to increase the knowledge of mankind was
regarded as the enemy of social order.Benedict Spinoza

One of the greatest thinkers of the world was Benedict Spinoza--a Jew,
born at Amsterdam in 1638.He asked the rabbis so many questions, and insisted to such a degree on
what he called reason, that his room was preferred to his company.His Jewish brethren excommunicated him from the synagogue.Under the
terrible curse of their religion he was made an outcast from every
Jewish home.His own father could not give him shelter, and his mother,
after the curse had been pronounced, could not give him bread, could not
even speak to him, without becoming an outcast herself.All the cruelty
of Jehovah was in this curse.Spinoza was but twenty-four years old
when he found himself without friends and without kindred.He earned his bread with willing hands, and cheerfully
divided his poor crust with those below.He tried to solve the problem
of existence.According to him the universe did not commence to
be.It is; from eternity it was; and to eternity it will be.He insisted
that God is inside, not outside, of what we call substance.Thomas Paine

Poverty was his mother--Necessity his master.He had more brains than
books; more sense than education; more courage than politeness;
more strength than polish.He had no veneration for old mistakes--no
admiration for ancient lies.He loved the truth for the truth's
sake, and for man's sake.He saw oppression on every hand; injustice
everywhere; hypocrisy at the altar, venality on the bench, tyranny on
the throne; and with a splendid courage he espoused the cause of the
weak against the strong--of the enslaved many against the titled few.The Greatest of all Political Writers

In my judgment, Thomas Paine was the best political writer that ever
lived."What he wrote was pure nature, and his soul and his pen ever
went together."Ceremony, pageantry, and all the paraphernalia of
power, had no effect upon him.He examined into the why and wherefore of
things.He was perfectly radical in his mode of thought.Nothing short
of the bed-rock satisfied him.His enthusiasm for what he believed to
be right knew no bounds.During all the dark scenes of the Revolution,
never for one moment did he despair.Year after year his brave words
were ringing through the land, and by the bivouac fires the weary
soldiers read the inspiring words of "Common Sense," filled with ideas
sharper than their swords, and consecrated themselves anew to the cause
of Freedom.The Writings of Paine

The writings of Paine are gemmed with compact statements that carry
conviction to the dullest.Day and night he labored for America, until
there was a government of the people and for the people.At the close
of the Revolution no one stood higher than Thomas Paine.Had he been
willing to live a hypocrite, he would have been respectable, he at least
could have died surrounded by other hypocrites, and at his death there
would have been an imposing funeral, with miles of carriages, filled
with hypocrites, and above his hypocritical dust there would have been a
hypocritical monument covered with lies.The truth is, he died as he had lived.Some ministers were impolite
enough to visit him against his will.Several of them he ordered
from his room.A couple of Catholic priests, in all the meekness of
hypocrisy, called that they might enjoy the agonies of a dying friend
of man.Thomas Paine, rising in his bed, the few embers of expiring life
blown into flame by the breath of indignation, had the goodness to curse
them both.His physician, who seems to have been a meddling fool, just
as the cold hand of death was touching the patriot's heart, whispered
in the dull ear of the dying man: "Do you believe, or do you wish to
believe, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?"And the reply was: "I
have no wish to believe on that subject."These were the last remembered
words of Thomas Paine.He died as serenely as ever Christian passed
away.He died in the full possession of his mind, and on the very brink
and edge of death proclaimed the doctrines of his life.Paine Believed in God

Thomas Paine was a champion in both hemispheres of human liberty; one of
the founders and fathers of the Republic; one of the foremost men of his
age.He never wrote a word in favor of injustice.He was a despiser of
slavery.He wast in the widest and
best sense, a friend of all his race.His head was as clear as his heart
was good, and he had the courage to speak his honest thought.He was
the first man to write these words: "The United States of America."He furnished every thought
that now glitters in the Declaration of Independence.He believed in one
God and no more.He was a believer even in special providence, and he
hoped for immortality.The Intellectual Hera

Thomas Paine was one of the intellectual heroes--one of the men to whom
we are indebted.His name is associated forever with the Great Republic.As long as free government exists he will be remembered, admired and
honored.He lived a long, laborious and useful life.The world is better
for his having lived.For the sake of truth he accepted hatred and
reproach for his portion.His friends
were untrue to him because he was true to himself, and true to them.He
lost the respect of what is called society, but kept his own.His life
is what the world calls failure and what history calls success.If to
love your fellow-men more than self is goodness, Thomas Paine was good.If to be in advance of your time--to be a pioneer in the direction of
right--is greatness.If to avow your principles and discharge your
duty in the presence of death is heroic, Thomas Paine was a hero.At the
age of seventy-three, death touched his tired heart.He died in the land
his genius defended--under the flag he gave to the skies.Slander cannot
touch him now--hatred cannot reach him more.He sleeps in the sanctuary
of the tomb, beneath the quiet of the stars.Paine, Franklin, Jefferson

In our country there were three infidels--Paine, Franklin and Jefferson.The colonies were full of superstition, the Puritans with the spirit
of persecution.Laws savage, ignorant, and malignant had been passed in
every colony for the purpose of destroying intellectual liberty.The toleration acts of
Maryland tolerated only Christians--not infidels, not thinkers, not
investigators.The charity of Roger Williams was not extended to those
who denied the Bible, or suspected the divinity of Christ.It was not
based upon the rights of man, but upon the rights of believers, who
differed in non-essential points.David Hume

On the 26th of April, 1711, David Hume was born.David Hume was one of
the few Scotchmen of his day who were not owned by the church.He had
the manliness to examine historical and religious questions for himself,
and the courage to give his conclusions to the world.He was singularly
capable of governing himself.He was a philosopher, and lived a calm
and cheerful life, unstained by an unjust act, free from all excess,
and devoted in a reasonable degree to benefiting his fellow-men.After
examining the Bible he became convinced that it was not true.For
failing to suppress his real opinion, for failing to tell a deliberate
falsehood, he brought upon him the hatred of the church.Voltaire

Voltaire was the intellectual autocrat of his time.From his throne at
the foot of the Alps he pointed the finger of scorn at every hypocrite
in Europe.He left the quiver of ridicule without an arrow.He was the
pioneer of his century.Through the
shadows of faith and fable, through the darkness of myth and miracle,
through the midnight of Christianity, through the blackness of bigotry,
past cathedral and dungeon, past rack and stake, past altar and throne,
he carried, with brave and chivalric hands, the torch of reason.John Calvin

Calvin was of a pallid, bloodless complexion, thin, sickly, irritable,
gloomy, impatient, egotistic, tyrannical, heartless, and infamous.He
was a strange compound of revengeful morality, malicious forgiveness,
ferocious charity, egotistic humility, and a kind of hellish justice.In other words, he was as near like the God of the Old Testament as his
health permitted.Calvin's Five Fetters

This man forged five fetters for the brain.That is to say, predestination, particular redemption, total
depravity, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints.About
the neck of each follower he put a collar bristling with these five iron
points.The presence of all these points on the collar is still the test
of orthodoxy in the church he founded.This man, when in the flush of
youth, was elected to the office of preacher in Geneva.He at once,
in union with Farel, drew up a condensed statement of the Presbyterian
doctrine, and all the citizens of Geneva, on pain of banishment, were
compelled to take an oath that they believed this statement.Of this
proceeding Calvin very innocently remarked that it produced great
satisfaction.A man named Caroli had the audacity to dispute with
Calvin.Humboldt

Humboldt breathed the atmosphere of investigation.Old ideas were
abandoned; old creeds, hallowed by centuries, were thrown aside; thought
became courageous; the athlete, Reason, challenged to mortal combat the
monsters of superstition.Humbolt's Travels

Europe becoming too small for his genius, he visited the tropics.He
sailed along the gigantic Amazon--the mysterious Orinoco--traversed the
Pampas--climbed the Andes until he stood upon the crags of Chimborazo,
more than eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, and climbed
on until blood flowed from his eyes and lips.For nearly five years he
pursued his investigations in the new world, accompanied by the intrepid
Bonplandi.He was the best intellectual
organ of these new revelations of science.He was calm, reflective and
eloquent; filled with a sense of the beautiful, and the love of truth.His collections were immense, and valuable beyond calculation to every
science.He endured innumerable hardships, braved countless dangers in
unknown and savage lands, and exhausted his fortune for the advancement
of true learning.Humboldt's Illustrious Companions

Humboldt was the friend and companion of the greatest poets, historians,
philologists, artists, statesmen, critics, and logicians of his time.He was the companion of Schiller, who believed that man would be
regenerated through the influence of the Beautiful of Goethe, the grand
patriarch of German literature; of Weiland, who has been called
the Voltaire of Germany; of Herder, who wrote the outlines of a
philosophical history of man; of Kotzebue, who lived in the world of
romance; of Schleiermacher, the pantheist; of Schlegel, who gave to
his countrymen the enchanted realm of Shakespeare; of the sublime Kant,
author of the first work published in Germany on Pure Reason; of Fichte,
the infinite idealist; of Schopenhauer, the European Buddhist who
followed the great Gautama to the painless and dreamless Nirwana, and
of hundreds of others, whose names are familiar to and honored by the
scientific world.Humboldt the Apostle of Science

Upon his return to Europe he was hailed as the second Columbus; as the
scientific discover of America; as the revealer of a new world; as the
great demonstrator of the sublime truth, that the universe is governed
by law.I have seen a picture of the old man, sitting upon a mountain
side--above him the eternal snow--below, the smiling valley of the
tropics, filled with vine and palm; his chin upon his breast, his
eyes deep, thoughtful and calm his forehead majestic--grander than the
mountain upon which he sat--crowned with the snow of his whitened hair,
he looked the intellectual autocrat of this world.Not satisfied with
his discoveries in America, he crossed the steppes of Asia, the wastes
of

Siberia, the great Ural range adding to the knowledge of mankind at
every step.H is energy acknowledged no obstacle, his life knew no
leisure; every day was filled with labor and with thought.He was one
of the apostles of science, and he served his divine master with
a self-sacrificing zeal that knew no abatement; with an ardor that
constantly increased, and with a devotion unwavering and constant as the
polar star.Ingersoll Muses by Napoleon's Tomb

A little while ago I stood by the grave of the old Napoleon--a
magnificent tomb of gilt and gold, fit almost for a dead deity--and
gazed upon the sarcophagus of black Egyptian marble, where rest at last
the ashes of the restless man.I leaned over the balustrade and thought
about the career of the greatest soldier of the modern world.I saw him
walking upon the banks of the Seine, contemplating suicide--I saw him
at Toulon--I saw him putting down the mob in the streets of Paris--I saw
him at the head of the army of Italy--I saw him crossing the bridge of
Lodi with the tri-color in his hand--I saw him in Egypt in the shadows
of the pyramids--I saw him conquer the Alps and mingle the eagles of
France with the eagles of the crags.I saw him at Marengo--at Ulm and
Austerlitz.I saw him in Russia, where the infantry of the snow and the
cavalry of the wild blast scattered his legions like Winter's withered
leaves.I saw him at Leipsic in defeat and disaster--driven by a million
bayonets back upon Paris--clutched like a wild beast--banished to Elba.I saw him escape and retake an empire by the force of his genius.I saw
him upon the frightful field of Waterloo, where chance and fate combined
to wreck the fortunes of their former king.Helena,
with his hands crossed behind him, gazing out upon the sad and solemn
sea.I thought of the orphans and widows he had made--of the tears that
had been shed for his glory, and of the only woman who ever loved him,
pushed from his heart by the cold hand of ambition.And I said I would
rather have been a French peasant, and worn wooden shoes.I would rather
have lived in a hut with a vine growing over the door, and the grapes
growing purple in the kisses of the Autumn sun.I would rather have been
that poor peasant with my loving wife by my side, knitting as the day
died out of the sky--with my children upon my knees and their arms about
me; I would rather have been that man and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust, than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder known as Napoleon the Great.And so I
would, ten thousand times.Eulogy on J. G. Blaine

This is a grand year--a year filled with recollections of the
Revolution; filled with the proud and tender memories of the past; with
the sacred legends of liberty; a year in which the sons of freedom will
drink from the fountains of enthusiasm; a year in which the people call
for a man who has preserved in Congress what our soldiers won upon
the field; a year in which they call for the man who has torn from the
throat of treason the tongue of slander--for the man who has snatched
the mask of Democracy from the hideous face of rebellion; for this man
who, like an intellectual athlete, has stood in the arena of debate and
challenged all comers, and who is still a total stranger to defeat.Like
an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine marched down the
halls of the American Congress and threw his shining lance full and
fair against the brazen foreheads of the defamers of his country and the
maligners of her honor.For the Republican party to desert this gallant
leader now is as though an army should desert their General upon the
field of battle.James G. Blaine is now and has been for years the
bearer of the sacred standard of the Republican party.A Model Leader

The Republicans of the United States want a man who knows that this
Government should protect every citizen, at home and abroad; who knows
that any Government that will not defend its defenders and protect its
protectors is a disgrace to the map of the world.They demand a man who
believes in the eternal separation and divorcement of church and school.They demand a man whose political reputation is as spotless as a star;
but they do not demand that their candidate shall have a certificate of
moral character signed by a Confederate Congress.The man who has, in
full, heaped and rounded measure, all these splendid qualifications is
the present grand and gallant leader of the Republican party--James G.
Blaine.Our country, crowned with the vast and marvelous achievements
of its first century, asks for a man worthy of the past and prophetic
of her future; asks for a man who has the audacity of genius; asks for
a man who is the grandest combination of heart, conscience and brain
beneath her flag.Such a man is James G. Blaine.Abraham Lincoln

This world has not been fit to live in fifty years.There is no liberty
in it--very little.Why, it is only a few years ago that all the
Christian nations were engaged in the slave trade.It was not until 1808
that England abolished the slave trade, and up to that time her priests
in her churches and her judges on her benches owned stock in slave
ships, and luxuriated on the profits of piracy and murder; and when a
man stood up and denounced it they mobbed him as though he had been a
common burglar or a horse thief.It was not until the 28th
day of August, 1833, that England abolished slavery in her colonies; and
it was not until the 1st day of January, 1862, that Abraham Lincoln, by
direction of the entire North, wiped that infamy out of this country;
and I never speak of Abraham Lincoln but I want to say that he was, in
my judgment, in many respects the grandest man ever President of the
United States.I say that upon his tomb there ought to be this line--and
I know of no other man deserving it so well as he: "Here lies one who
having been clothed with almost absolute power never abused it except on
the side of mercy."Swedenborg

Swedenborg was a man of great intellect, of vast acquirements, and of
honest intentions; and I think it equally clear that upon one subject,
at least, his mind was touched, shattered and shaken.Misled by
analogies, imposed upon by the bishop, deceived by the woman, borne to
other worlds upon the wings of dreams, living in the twilight of reason
and the dawn of insanity, he regarded every fact as a patched and ragged
garment with a lining of the costliest silk, and insisted that the wrong
side, even of the silk, was far more beautiful than the right.Jeremy Bentham

The glory of Bentham is, that he gave the true basis of morals, and
furnished the statesmen with the star and compass of this sentence: "The
greatest happiness of the greatest number."Charles Fourier

Fourier sustained about the same relation to this world that Swedenborg
did to the other.There must be something wrong about the brain of one
who solemnly asserts that "the elephant, the ox and the diamond were
created by the Sun; the horse, the lily, and the ruby, by Saturn; the
cow, the jonquil and the topaz, by Jupiter; and the dog, the violet
and the opal stones by the earth itself."And yet, forgetting these
aberrations of the mind, this lunacy of a great and loving soul, for
one, that's in tender-est regard the memory of Charles Fourier, one of
the best and noblest of our race.Auguste Comte

There was in the brain of the great Frenchman--Auguste Comte--the dawn
of that happy day in which humanity will be the only religion, good the
only God, happiness the only object, restitution the only atonement,
mistake the only sin, and affection guided by intelligence, the only
savior of mankind.This dawn enriched his poverty, illuminated the
darkness of his life, peopled his loneliness with the happy millions yet
to be, and filled his eyes with proud and tender tears.When everything
connected with Napoleon, except his crimes, shall be forgotten, Auguste
Comte will be lovingly remembered as a benefactor of the human race.Herbert Spencer

Herbert Spencer relies upon evidence, upon demonstration, upon
experience; and occupies himself with one world at a time.He perceives
that there is a mental horizon that we cannot pierce, and that beyond
that is the unknown, possibly the unknowable.He endeavors to examine
only that which is capable of being examined, and considers the
theological method as not only useless, but hurtful.After all God is
but a guess, throned and established by arrogance and assertion.Turning his attention to those things that have in some way affected
the condition of mankind, Spencer leaves the unknowable to priests and
believers.Robert Collyer

I have the honor of a slight acquaintance with Robert Collyer.I have
read with pleasure some of his exquisite productions.He has a brain
full of the dawn, the head of a philosopher, the imagination of a poet
and the sincere heart of a child.Had such men as Robert Collyer and
John Stuart Mill been present at the burning of Servetus, they would
have extinguished the flames with their tears.Had the presbytery of
Chicago been there, they would have quietly turned their backs, solemnly
divided their coat tails, and warmed themselves.John Milton

England was filled with Puritan gloom and Episcopal ceremony.All
religious conceptions were of the grossest nature.The ideas of crazy
fanatics and extravagant poets were taken as sober facts.Milton had
clothed Christianity in the soiled and faded finery of the gods--had
added to the story of Christ the fables of Mythology, He gave to the
Protestant Church the most outrageously material ideas of the Deity.He turned all the angels into soldiers--made heaven a battlefield, put
Christ in uniform, and described God as a militia general.His works
were considered by the Protestants nearly as sacred as the Bible
itself, and the imagination of the people was thoroughly polluted by the
horrible imagery, the sublime absurdity of the blind Milton.Ernst Haeckel

Amongst the bravest, side by side with the greatest of the world in
Germany, the land of science--stands Ernst Haeckel, who may be said
not only to have demonstrated the theories of Darwin, but the monistic
conception of the world.He has endeavored--and I think with complete
success--to show that there is not, and never was, and never can be,
the creator of anything.Haeckel is one of the bitterest enemies of the
church, and is, therefore, one of the bravest friends of man.Professor Swing, a Dove amongst Vultures

Professor Swing was too good a man to stay in the Presbyterian Church.He was a rose amongst thistles; he was a dove amongst vultures; and they
hunted him out, and I am glad he came out.I have the greatest respect
for Professor Swing, but I want him to tell whether the 109th Psalm is
inspired.Queen Victoria and George Eliot

Compare George Eliot with Queen Victoria.The Queen is clad in garments
given her by blind fortune and unreasoning chance, while George Eliot
wears robes of glory woven in the loom of her own genius.The time is coming when men will be rated at their real
worth; when we shall care nothing for an officer if he does not fill his
place.Bough on Rabbi Bien

I will not answer Rabbi Bien, and I will tell you why.Because he has
taken himself outside of all the limits of a gentleman; because he has
taken upon himself to traduce American women in language the beastliest
I ever read; and any man who says that the American women are not just
as good women as any God can make, and pick his mind to-day, is an
unappreciative barbarian.I will let him alone because he denounced all
the men in this country, all the members of Congress, all the members
of the Senate, all the Judges on the bench, as thieves and robbers.I
pronounce him a vulgar falsifier, and let him alone.General Garfield

No man has been nominated for the office since I was born, by either
party, who had more brains and more heart than James A. Garfield.He
was a soldier, he is a statesman.In time of peace he preferred the
avocations of peace; when the bugle of war blew in his ears he withdrew
from his work and fought for the flag, and then he went back to the
avocation of peace.And I say to-day that a man who, in a time of
profound peace, makes up his mind that he would like to kill folks for
a living is no better, to say the least of it, than the man who loves
peace in the time of peace, and who, when his country is attacked,
rushes to the rescue of her flag."Wealthy in Integrity; In Brain a Millionaire."James A. Garfield is to-day a poor man, and you know that there is not
money enough in this magnificent street to buy the honor and manhood of
James A. Garfield.Money cannot make such a man, and I will swear to you
that money cannot buy him.James A. Garfield to-day wears the glorious
robe of honest poverty.He is a poor man; but I like to say it here in
Wall street; I like to say it surrounded by the millions of America; I
like to say it in the midst of banks, and bonds, and stocks; I love to
say it where gold is piled--that, although a poor man, he is rich in
honor, in integrity he is wealthy, and in brain he is a millionaire.Garfield a Certificate of the Splendor of the American Constitution

Garfield is a certificate of the splendor of our Government, that says
to every poor boy: "All the avenues of honor are open to you."He is a scholar; he is a statesman; he was a
soldier; he is a patriot; and above all he is a magnificent man, and if
every man in New York knew him as well as I do, Garfield would not lose
a hundred votes in this city.W. Hiram Thomas

The best thing that has come from the other side is from Dr.I
regard him as by far the grandest intellect in the Methodist Church.He
is intellectually a wide and tender man.I cannot conceive of an article
being written in a better spirit.He finds a little fault with me for
not being exactly fair.Thomas
the probability is I never should have laid myself liable to criticism.There is some human nature in me, and I find it exceedingly difficult
to preserve at all times perfect serenity.I have the greatest possible
respect for Dr.Thomas, and must heartily thank him for his perfect
fairness.MISCELLANEOUS




355.Heresy and Orthodoxy

It has always been the man ahead that has been called the heretic.Heresy is the last and best thought always!Heresy extends the
hospitality of the brain to a new idea; that is what the rotting says to
flax growing; that is what the dweller in the swamp says to the man on
the sun-lit hill; that is what the man in the darkness cries out to the
grand man upon whose forehead is shining the dawn of a grander day; that
is what the coffin says to the cradle.Orthodoxy is a kind of shroud,
and heresy is a banner--Orthodoxy is a fog and Heresy a star shining
forever upon the cradle of truth.I do not mean simply in religion, I
mean in everything and the idea I wish to impress upon you is that you
should keep your minds open to all the influences of nature, you should
keep your minds open to reason; hear what a man has to say, and do not
let the turtle-shell of bigotry grow above your brain.Give everybody a
chance and an opportunity; that is all.We used to worship the golden calf, and the worst you can say of us now,
is, we worship the gold of the calf, and even the calves are beginning
to see this distinction.We used to go down on our knees to every man
that held office, now he must fill it if he wishes any respect.We care
nothing for the rich, except what will they do with their money?How does he fill it?--that is the question.And there is rapidly growing
up in the world an aristocracy of heart and brain--the only aristocracy
that has a right to exist.Truth will Bear the Test

If a man has a diamond that has been examined by the lapidaries of the
world, and some ignorant stonecutter told him that it is nothing but
an ordinary rock, he laughs at him; but if it has not been examined
by lapidaries, and he is a little suspicious himself that it is not
genuine, it makes him mad.Any doctrine that will not bear investigation
is not a fit tenant for the mind of an honest man.Any man who is afraid
to have his doctrine investigated is not only a coward but a hypocrite.Paring Nails

Why should we in this age of the world be dominated by the dead?Why
should barbarian Jews who went down to death and dust three thousand
years ago, control the living world?Why should we care for the
superstition of men who began the sabbath by paring their nails,
"beginning at the fourth finger, then going to the second, then to the
fifth, then to the third, and ending with the thumb?"How pleasing to
God this must have been.There may be a God

There may be for aught I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast,
some being whose dreams are constellations and within whose thought the
infinite exists.About this being, if such an one exists, I have nothing
to say.He has written no books, inspired no barbarians, required no
worship, and has prepared no hell in which to burn the honest seeker
after truth.The People are Beginning to Think

The people are beginning to think, to reason and to investigate.Slowly,
painfully, but surely, the gods are being driven from the earth.Only
upon rare occasions are they, even by the most religious, supposed to
interfere in the affairs of men.In most matters we are at last supposed
to be free.Since the invention of steamships and railways, so that the
products of all countries can be easily interchanged, the gods have quit
the business of producing famine.Unchained Thought

For the vagaries of the clouds the infidels propose to substitute the
realities of earth; for superstition, the splendid demonstrations and
achievements of science; and for theological tyranny, the chainless
liberty of thought.Man the Victor of the Future

If abuses are destroyed, man must destroy them.If slaves are freed, man
must free them.If new truths are discovered, man must discover them.If the naked are clothed; if the hungry are fed; if justice is done;
if labor is rewarded; if superstition is driven from the mind; if the
defenseless are protected, and if the right finally triumphs, all must
be the work of man.The grand victories of the future must be won by
man, and by man alone.The Sacred Sabbath

Of all the superstitious of mankind, this insanity about the "sacred
Sabbath" is the most absurd.The idea of feeling it a duty to be solemn
and sad one-seventh of the time!To think that we can please an infinite
being by staying in some dark and sombre room, instead of walking in the
perfumed fields!Why should God hate to see a man happy?Why should it
excite his wrath to see a family in the woods, by some babbling stream,
talking, laughing and loving?Nature works on that "sacred" day.The
earth turns, the rivers run, the trees grow, buds burst into flower, and
birds fill the air with song.Why should we look sad, and think about
death, and hear about-hell?Why should that day be filled with gloom
instead of joy?Make the Sabbath Merry

Freethinkers should make the Sabbath a day of mirth and music; a day to
spend with wife and child--a day of games, and books, and dreams--a day
to put fresh flowers above our sleeping dead--a day of memory and hope,
of love and rest.Away to the Hills and the Sea

A poor mechanic, working all the week in dust and noise, needs a day of
rest and joy, a day to visit stream and wood--a day to live with wife
and child; a day in which to laugh at care, and gather hope and strength
for toils to come.And his weary wife needs a breath of sunny air, away
from street and wall, amid the hills or by the margin of the sea, where
she can sit and prattle with her babe, and fill with happy dreams the
long, glad day.Melancholy Sundays

When I was a little fellow most everybody thought that some days were
too sacred for the young ones to enjoy themselves in.Sunday used to commence Saturday night at sundown, under
the old text, "The evening and the morning were the first day."They
commenced then, I think, to get a good ready.When the sun went down
Saturday night, darkness ten thousand times deeper than ordinary night
fell upon that house.The boy that looked the sickest was regarded as
the most pious.You could not crack hickory nuts that night, and if you
were caught chewing gum it was another evidence of the total depravity
of the human heart.We would sometimes
sing, "Another day has passed."Everybody looked as though they had the
dyspesia--you know lots of people think they are pious, just because
they are bilious, as Mr.It was a solemn night, and the next
morning the solemnity had increased.Then we went to church, and the
minister was in a pulpit about twenty feet high.If it was in the winter
there was no fire; it was not thought proper to be comfortable while you
were thanking the Lord.The minister commenced at firstly and ran up to
about twenty-fourthly, and then he divided it up again; and then he
made some concluding remarks, and then he said lastly, and when he said
lastly he was about half through.Moses took Egyptian Law for his Model

It has been contended for many years that the ten commandments are the
foundation of all ideas of justice and of law.Eminent jurists have
bowed to popular prejudice, and deformed their works by statements to
the effect that the Mosaic laws are the fountains from which sprang all
ideas of right and wrong.Nothing can be more stupidly false than such
assertions.Thousands of years before Moses was born, the Egyptians
had a code of laws.They had laws against blasphemy, murder, adultery,
larceny, perjury, laws for the collection of debts, and the enforcement
of contracts.A False Standard of Success

It is not necessary to be rich, nor powerful, nor great, to be a
success; and neither is it necessary to have your name between the
putrid lips of rumor to be great.We have had a false standard of
success.In the years when I was a little boy we read in our books that
no fellow was a success that did not make a fortune or get a big office,
and he generally was a man that slept about three hours a night.They
never put down in the books the gentlemen who succeeded in life and yet
slept all they wanted to.Toilers and Idlers

You can divide mankind into two classes: the laborers and the idlers,
the supporters and the supported, the honest and the dishonest.Every
man is dishonest who lives upon the unpaid labor of others, no matter
if he occupies a throne.The laborers
should have equal-rights before the world and before the law.And I want
every farmer to consider every man who labors either with hand or brain
as his brother.Until genius and labor formed a partnership there was
no such thing as prosperity among men.Every reaper and mower, every
agricultural implement, has elevated the work of the farmer, and his
vocation grows grander with every invention.In the olden time the
agriculturist was ignorant; he knew nothing of machinery, he was the
slave of superstition.The Sad Wilderness History

While reading the Pentateuch, I am filled with indignation, pity and
horror.Nothing can be sadder than the history of the starved and
frightened wretches who wandered over the desolate crags and sands of
wilderness and desert, the prey of famine, sword and plague.Ignorant
and superstitious to the last degree, governed by falsehood, plundered
by hypocrisy, they were the sport of priests, and the food of fear.God
was their greatest enemy, and death their only friend.Law Much Older than Sinai

Laws spring from the instinct of self-preservation.Industry objected
to supporting idleness, and laws were made against theft.Laws were made
against murder, because a very large majority of the people have always
objected to being murdered.All fundamental laws were born simply of the
instinct of self-defence.Long before the Jewish savages assembled at
the foot of Sinai, laws had been made and enforced, not only in Egypt
and India, but by every tribe that ever existed.God raised the black flag, and
commanded his soldiers to kill even the smiling infant in its mother's
arms.Who is the blasphemer; the man who denies the existence of God, or
he who covers the robes of the infinite with innocent blood?Standing Tip for God

We are told in the Pentateuch that God, the father of us all, gave
thousands of maidens, after having killed their fathers, their mothers,
and their brothers, to satisfy the brutal lusts of savage men.If there
be a God, I pray him to write in his book, opposite my name, that I
denied this lie for him.Matter and Force

The statement in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, I
cannot accept.It is contrary to my reason, and I cannot believe it.It
appears reasonable for me that force has existed from eternity.Force
cannot, as it appears to me, exist apart from matter.Force, in its
nature, is forever active, and without matter it could not act; and so
I think matter must have existed forever.To conceive of matter without
force, or of force without matter, or of a time when neither existed,
or of a being who existed for an eternity without either, and who out of
nothing created both, is to me utterly impossible.It may be that I am led to these conclusions by "total depravity," or
that I lack the necessary humility of spirit to satisfactorily harmonize
Haeckel and Moses; or that I am carried away by pride, blinded by
reason, given over to hardness of heart that I might be damned, but I
never can believe that the earth was covered with leaves, and buds, and
flowers, and fruits, before the sun with glittering spear had driven
back the hosts of night.We are told that God made man; and the question naturally arises, how
was this done?Was it by a process of "evolution," "development;" the
"transmission of acquired habits;" the "survival of the fittest," or was
the necessary amount of clay kneaded to the proper consistency, and then
by the hands of God moulded into form?Modern science tells that man has
been evolved, through countless epochs, from the lower forms; that he
is the result of almost an infinite number of actions, reactions,
experiences, states, forms, wants and adaptations.General Joshua

My own opinion is that General Joshua knew no more about the motions of
the earth than he did mercy and justice.If he had known that the earth
turned upon its axis at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, and swept
in its course about the sun at the rate of sixty-eight thousand miles
an hour, he would have doubled the hailstones, spoken of in the same
chapter, that the Lord cast down from heaven, and allowed the sun and
moon to rise and set in the usual way.This getting up so early in the morning is a relic of barbarism.It has
made hundreds of thousands of young men curse business.There is no need
of getting up at three or four o'clock in the winter morning.The farmer
who persists in dragging his wife and children from their beds ought to
be visited by a missionary.It is time enough to rise after the sun has
set the example.Why
not feed them more the night before?In the old
times they used to get up about three o'clock in the morning, and go to
work long before the sun had risen with "healing upon his wings," and as
a just punishment they all had the ague; and they ought to have it now.Sleep is the best medicine
in the world.There is no such thing as health, without plenty of sleep.When you work, work;
and when you get through take a good, long and refreshing sleep.Never Rise at Four O'Clock

The man who cannot get a living upon Illinois soil without rising before
daylight ought to starve.Eight hours a day is enough for any farmer to
work except in harvest time.When you rise at four and work till dark
what is life worth?Of what use are all the improvements in farming?Of what use is all the improved machinery unless it tends to give the
farmer a little more leisure?What is harvesting now, compared with what
it was in the old time?Think of the days of reaping, of cradling, of
raking and binding and mowing.Think of threshing with the flail and
winnowing with the wind.And now think of the reapers and mowers, the
binders and threshing machines, the plows and cultivators, upon which
the farmer rides protected from the sun.If, with all these advantages,
you cannot get a living without rising in the middle of the night, go
into some other business.The Hermit is Mad

A hermit is a mad man.Without friends and wife and child, there is
nothing left worth living for.They
are filled with egotism and envy, with vanity and hatred.People who
live much alone become narrow and suspicious.They are apt to be the
property of one idea.They begin to think there is no use in anything.They look upon the happiness of others as a kind of folly.They hate
joyous folks, because, way down in their hearts, they envy them.Duke Orang-Outang

I think we came from the lower animals.I am not dead sure of it, but
think so.When I first read about it I didn't like it.My heart was
filled with sympathy for those people who leave nothing to be proud of
except ancestors.I thought how terrible this will be upon the nobility
of the old world.Think of their being forced to trace their ancestry
back to the Duke Orang-Outang or to the Princess Chimpanzee.After
thinking it all over I came to the conclusion that I liked that
doctrine.I read about
rudimentary bones and muscles.I was told that everybody had rudimentary
muscles extending from the ear into the cheek.I was told: "They are the remains of muscles; they became rudimentary
from the lack of use."They are the muscles
with which your ancestors used to flap their ears.Well, at first I was
greatly astonished, and afterward I was more astonished to find they had
become rudimentary.Self-Made Men

It is often said of this or that man that he is a self-made man--that
he was born of the poorest and humblest parents, and that with every
obstacle to overcome he became great.Most of the intellectual giants of the world
have been nursed at the sad but loving breast of poverty.Most of those
who have climbed highest on the shining ladder of fame commenced at the
lowest round.They were reared in the straw thatched cottages of Europe;
in the log houses of America; in the factories of the great cities; in
the midst of toil; in the smoke and din of labor.The One Window in the Ark

A cubit is twenty-two inches; so that the ark was five hundred and fifty
feet long, ninety-one feet and eight inches wide, and fifty-five feet
high.The ark was divided into three stories, and had on top, one window
twenty-two inches square.Ventillation must have been one of Jehovah's
hobbies.Think of a ship larger than the Great Eastern with only one
window, and that but twenty-two inches square!No Ante-Diluvian Camp-Meetings!It is a little curious that when God wished to reform the ante-diluvian
world he said nothing about hell; that he had no revivals, no
camp-meetings, no tracts, no out-pourings of the Holy Ghost, no
baptisms, no noon prayer meetings, and never mentioned the great
doctrine of salvation by faith.If the orthodox creeds of the world are
true, all those people went to hell without ever having heard that such
a place existed.If eternal torment is a fact, surely these miserable
wretches ought to have been warned.They were threatened only with water
when they were in fact doomed to eternal fire!Hard Work in the Ark

Eight persons did all the work.They attended to the wants of 175,000
birds, 3,616 beasts, 1,300 reptiles, and 2,000,000 insects, saying
nothing of countless animalculae.Can we believe that the inspired writer had any idea of the size of the
sun?Draw a circle five inches in diameter, and by its side thrust a pin
through the paper.The hole made by the pin will sustain about the same
relation to the circle that the earth does to the sun.Did he know that
the sun was eight hundred and sixty thousand miles in diameter; that it
was enveloped in an ocean of fire thousands of miles in depth, hotter
even than the Christian's hell?Did he know that the volume of the Earth
is less than one-millionth of that of the sun?Did he know of the one
hundred and four planets belonging to our solar system, all children of
the sun?Did he know of Jupiter eighty-five thousand miles in diameter,
hundreds of times as large as our earth, turning on his axis at the rate
of twenty-five thousand miles an hour accompanied by four moons making
the tour of his orbit once only in fifty years?Something for Nothing

It is impossible for me to conceive of something being created for
nothing.Nothing, regarded in the light of raw material, is a decided
failure.Neither is it
possible to think of force disconnected with matter.You cannot imagine
matter going back to absolute nothing.Neither can you imagine nothing
being changed into something.You may be eternally damned if you do not
say that you can conceive these things, but you cannot conceive them.Polygamy

Polygamy is just as pure in Utah as it could have been in the promised
land.Love and virtue are the same the whole world around, and justice
is the same in every star.All the languages of the world are not
sufficient to express the filth of polygamy.It makes of man a beast,
of woman a trembling slave.It destroys the fireside, makes virtue an
outcast, takes from human speech its sweetest words, and leaves the
heart a den, where crawl and hiss the slimy serpents of most loathsome
lust.The good family is the unit
of good government.The virtues grow about the holy hearth of home--they
cluster, bloom, and shed their perfume round the fireside where the
one man loves the one woman.Lover--husband--wife--mother--father--child--home!--without these sacred
words the world is but a lair, and men and women merely beasts.The Colonel in the Kitchen--How to Cook a Beefsteak

There ought to be a law making it a crime, punishable by imprisonment,
to fry a beefsteak.Broil it; it is just as easy, and when broiled it
is delicious.Fried beefsteak is not fit for a wild beast.You can broil
even on a stove.Shut the front damper--open the back one, and then take
off a griddle.There will then be a draft down through this opening.Put
on your steak, using a wire broiler, and not a particle of smoke will
touch it, for the reason that the smoke goes down.If you try to broil
it with the front damper open the smoke will rise.For broiling, coal,
even soft coal, makes a better fire than wood.Do not huddle together in a little room
around a red-hot stove, with every window fastened down.Do not live in
this poisoned atmosphere, and then, when one of your children dies, put
a piece in the papers commencing with, "Whereas, it has pleased divine
Providence to remove from our midst--."Have plenty of air, and plenty
of warmth.Do not imagine anything is unhealthy
simply because it is pleasant.Cooking a Fine Art

Cooking is one of the fine arts.Give your wives and daughters things to
cook, and things to cook with, and they will soon become most excellent
cooks.The man whose arteries
and veins are filled with rich blood made of good and well cooked food,
has pluck, courage, endurance and noble impulses.Remember that your
wife should have things to cook with.Scathing Impeachment of Intemperance

Intemperance cuts down youth in its vigor, manhood in its strength, and
age in its weakness.It breaks the father's heart, bereaves the doting
mother, extinguishes natural affections, erases conjugal loves, blots
out filial attachments, blights parental hope, and brings down mourning
age in sorrow to the grave.It produces weakness, not strength;
sickness, not health; death, not life.It makes wives widows; children
orphans; fathers fiends, and all of them paupers and beggars.It feeds
rheumatism, nurses gout, welcomes epidemics, invites cholera, imports
pestilence and embraces consumption.It covers the land with idleness,
misery and crime.It fills your jails, supplies your almshouses and
demands your asylums.It engenders controversies, fosters quarrels, and
cherishes riots.It crowds your penitentiaries and furnishes victims to
your scaffolds.It is the life blood of the gambler, the element of
the burglar, the prop of the highwayman and the support of the midnight
incendiary.It countenances the liar, respects the thief, esteems
the blasphemer.It violates obligations, reverences fraud, and honors
infamy.It defames benevolence, hates love, scorns virtue and slanders
innocence.It incites the father to butcher his helpless offspring,
helps the husband to massacre his wife, and the child to grind the
parricidal ax.It burns up men, consumes women, detests life, curses God,
and despises heaven.It suborns witnesses, nurses perjury, defiles
the jury box, and stains the judicial ermine.It degrades the citizen,
debases the legislator, dishonors statesmen, and disarms the patriot.It
brings shame, not honor; terror, not safety; despair, not hope; misery,
not happiness; and with the malevolence of a fiend, it calmly surveys
its frightful desolation, and unsatisfied with its havoc, it poisons
felicity, kills peace, ruins morals, blights confidence, slays
reputation, and wipes out national honors, then curses the world and
laughs at its ruin.Liberty Defined

The French convention gave the best definition of liberty I have ever
read: "The liberty of one citizen ceases only where the liberty of
another citizen commences."I ask you
to-day to make a declaration of individual independence.And if you are
independent, be just.Allow everybody else to make his declaration of
individual independence.Allow your wife, allow your husband, allow
your children to make theirs.It is a grand thing to be the owner of
yourself.It is a grand thing to protect the rights of others.It is a
sublime thing to be free and just.Free, Honest Thought

I am going to say what little I can to make the American people brave
enough and generous enough and kind enough to give everybody else the
rights they have themselves.Can there ever be any progress in this
world to amount to anything until we have liberty?The thoughts of a man
who is not free are not worth much--not much.A man who thinks with the
club of a creed above his head--a man who thinks casting his eye askance
at the flames of hell, is not apt to have very good thoughts.And for
my part, I would not care to have any status or social position even in
heaven if I had to admit that I never would have been there only I got
scared.When we are frightened we do not think very well.If you want to
get at the honest thoughts of a man he must free.If he is not free you
will not get his honest thought.Ingersoll Prefers Shoemakers to Princes

The other day there came shoemakers, potters, workers in wood and iron,
from Europe, and they were received in the city of New York as though
they had been princes.They had been sent by the great republic of
France to examine into the arts and manufactures of the great republic
of America.They looked a thousand times better to me than the Edward
Alberts and Albert Edwards--the royal vermin, that live on the body
politic.And I would think much more of our government if it would fete
and feast them, instead of wining and dining the imbeciles of a royal
line.I never saw a dignified man that was not after all an
old idiot Dignity is a mask; a dignified man is afraid that you will
know he does not know everything.A man of sense and argument is always
willing to admit what he don't know--why?--because there is so much
that he does know; and that is the first step towards learning
anything--willingness to admit what you don't know, and when you don't
understand a thing, ask--no matter how small and silly it may look to
other people--ask, and after that you know.A man never is in a state of
mind that he can learn until he gets that dignified nonsense out of him.The time is coming when a man will be rated at his real worth, and that
by his brain and heart.We care nothing now about an officer unless he
fills his place.The time will come when no matter how much money a man
has he will not be respected unless he is using it for the benefit of
his fellow-men.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen
States to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the
conveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes
two hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves
his friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the
obligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest
sympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for
himself, is the true nobleman.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of
the air and have given one country to mankind.Wanted!--More Manliness

I had a thousand times rather have a farm and be independent, than to be
President of the United States, without independence, filled with
doubt and trembling, feeling of the popular pulse, resorting to art and
artifice, inquiring about the wind of opinion, and succeeding at last in
losing my self-respect without gaining the respect of others.Man needs
more manliness, more real independence.This we can do by labor, and in this way we can preserve our
independence.We should try and choose that business or profession the
pursuit of which will give us the most happiness.We can be happy without being rich--without holding office--without
being famous.I am not sure that we can be happy with wealth, with
office, or with fame.Education of Nature

It has been a favorite idea with me that our forefathers were educated
by nature; that they grew grand as the continent upon which they landed;
that the great rivers--the wide plains--the splendid lakes--the lonely
forests--the sublime mountains--that all these things stole into and
became a part of their being, and they grew great as the country in
which they lived.They began to hate the narrow, contracted views of
Europe.The Worker Wearing the Purple

I want to see a workingman have a good house, painted white, grass in
the front yard, carpets on the floor and pictures on the wall.I want to
see him a man feeling that he is a king by the divine right of living in
the Republic.And every man here is just a little bit a king, you know.Every man here is a part of the sovereign power.Every man wears a
little of purple; every man has a little of crown and a little of
sceptre; and every man that will sell his vote for money or be ruled by
prejudice is unfit to be an American citizen.Flowers

Beautify your grounds with plants and flowers and vines.Remember that everything of beauty tends to the elevation of
man.Every little morning-glory whose purple bosom is thrilled with the
amorous kisses of the sun tends to put a blossom in your heart.Do not
judge of the value of everything by the market reports.Every flower
about a house certifies to the refinement of somebody.Every vine,
climbing and blossoming, tells of love and joy.The grave is not a throne, and a corpse is not a king.The living have
a right to control this world.I think a good deal more of to day than
I do of yesterday, and I think more of to-morrow than I do of this day;
because it is nearly gone--that is the way I feel.The time to be happy
is now; the way to be happy is to make somebody else happy and the place
to be happy is here.The School House a Fort

Education is the most radical thing in the world.To teach the alphabet is to inaugurate a revolution.To build a school
house is to construct a fort.We are Getting Free

We are getting free.We are
investigating with the microscope and the telescope.We are digging
into the earth and finding souvenirs of all the ages.We are finding out
something about the laws of health and disease.We are adding years to
the span of human life and we are making the world fit to live in.That is what we are doing, and every man that has an honest thought and
expresses it helps, and every man that tries to keep honest thought from
being expressed is an obstruction and a hindrance.The Solid Rock

I have made up my mind that if there is a God He will be merciful to the
merciful.That He will forgive the forgiving;
upon that rock I stand.That every man should be true to himself, and
that there is no world, no star, in which honesty is a crime; and upon
that rock I stand.An honest man, a good, kind, sweet woman, or a happy
child, has nothing to fear, neither in this world nor the world to come;
and upon that rock I stand.INGERSOLL'S FIVE GOSPELS




408.The Gospel of Cheerfulness

I believe in the gospel of cheerfulness; the gospel of good nature; in
the gospel of good health.Let us pay some attention to our bodies; take
care of our bodies, and our souls will take care of themselves.I believe the time will come when the public thought will be so
great and grand that it will be looked upon as infamous to perpetuate
disease.I believe the time will come when men will not fill the future
with consumption and with insanity.I believe the time will come when
with studying ourselves and understanding the laws of health, we will
say we are under obligations to put the flags of health in the cheeks of
our children.Even if I got to Heaven, and had a harp, I would hate to
look back upon my children and see them diseased, deformed, crazed, all
suffering the penalty of crimes that I had committed.The Gospel of Liberty

And I believe, too, in the gospel of liberty,---of giving to others what
we claim.And I believe there is room everywhere for thought, and
the more liberty you give away the more you will have.In liberty
extravagance is economy.Let us be just, let us be generous to each
other.The Gospel of 'Good Living

I believe in the gospel of good living.You cannot make any God happy by
fasting.Let us have good food, and let us have it well cooked; it is
a thousand times better to know how to cook it than it is to understand
any theology in the world.I
believe in the gospel of good houses; in the gospel of water and soap.The Gospel of Intelligence

I believe in the gospel of intelligence.That is the only lever capable
of raising mankind.I believe in the gospel of intelligence; in the
gospel of education.The school-house is my cathedral; the universe
is my Bible.And no God can put a man into hell in another world who has
made a little heaven in this.God cannot make miserable a man who has
made somebody else happy.God can not hate anybody who is capable of
loving his neighbor.So I believe in this great gospel of generosity.Ah, but they say it won't do.My gospel
of health will prolong life; my gospel of intelligence, my gospel of
loving, my gospel of good-fellowship will cover the world with happy
homes.My doctrine will put carpets upon your floors, pictures upon your
walls.My doctrine will put books upon your shelves, ideas in your mind.My doctrine will relieve the world of the abnormal monsters born of the
ignorance of superstition.My doctrine will give us health, wealth, and
happiness.The Gospel of Justice

I believe in the gospel of justice,--that we must reap what we sow.Smith, and God forgive me,
how does that help Smith?If I by slander cover some poor girl with
the leprosy of some imputed crime, and she withers away like a blighted
flower, and afterwards I get forgiveness, how does that help her?If
there is another world, we have got to settle; no bankruptcy court
there.Among the ancient Jews if you committed a crime you
had to kill a sheep; now they say, "Charge it.For every crime you commit you must answer to yourself and
to the one you injure.And if you have ever clothed another with
unhappiness as with a garment cf pain, you will never be quite as
happy as though you hadn't done that thing.No forgiveness, eternal,
inexorable, everlasting justice--that is what I believe in.And if it goes hard with me, I will stand it.And I will stick to my
logic, and I will bear it like a man.GEMS FROM THE CONTROVERSIAL GASKET

     Latest Utterances of Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll,
     in a Controversy with Judge Jere 8.Black,
     on "The Christian Religion"




413.The Origin of the Controversy

Several months ago, _The North American Review_ asked me to write an
article, saying that it would be published if some one would furnish a
reply.I wrote the article that appeared in the August number, and by
me it was entitled "Is All of the Bible Inspired?"Not until the
article was written did I know who was expected to answer.I make this
explanation for the purpose of dissipating the impression that Mr.To have struck his shield with my lance might
have given birth to the impression that I was somewhat doubtful as to
the correctness of my position.I naturally expected an answer from some
professional theologian, and was surprised to find that a reply had been
written by a "policeman," who imagined that he had answered my arguments
by simply telling me that my statements were false.It is somewhat
unfortunate that in a discussion like this any one should resort to the
slightest personal detraction.The theme is great enough to engage the
highest faculties of the human mind, and in the investigation of such a
subject vituperation is singularly and vulgarly out of place.Arguments
cannot be answered with insults.It is unfortunate that the intellectual
arena should be entered by a "policeman," who has more confidence in
concussion than discussion.Good nature is often
mistaken for virtue, and good health sometimes passes for genius.Anger blows out the lamp of the mind.In the examination of a great and
important question, every one should be serene, slow-pulsed, and calm.Black's reply, feeling that so
grand a subject should not be blown and tainted with malicious words, I
proceed to answer as best I may the arguments he has urged.Of course it is still claimed that we are a Christian people, indebted
to something we call Christianity, for all the progress we have made.There is still a vast difference of opinion as to what Christianity
really is, although many wavering sects have been discussing that
question, with fire and sword through centuries of creed and crime.Every new sect has been denounced at its birth as illegitimate, as
something born out of orthodox wedlock, and that should have been
allowed to perish on the steps where it was found.Summary of Evangelical Belief

Among the evangelical churches there is a substantial agreement
upon what they consider the fundamental truths of the gospel.These
fundamental truths, as I understand them, are:--That there is a personal
God, the creator of the material universe; that he made man of the dust,
and woman from part of the man; that the man and woman were tempted by
the devil; that they were turned out of the garden of Eden; that, about
fifteen hundred years afterward, God's patience having been exhausted by
the wickedness of mankind, He drowned His children, with the exception
of eight persons; that afterward He selected from their descendants
Abraham, and through him the Jewish people; that He gave laws to these
people, and tried to govern them in all things; that He made known His
will in many ways; that He wrought a vast number of miracles; that
He inspired men to write the Bible; that, in the fullness of time, it
having been found impossible to reform mankind, this God came upon earth
as a child born of the Virgin Mary; that He lived in Palestine; that He
preached for about three years, going from place to place, occasionally
raising the dead, curing the blind and the halt; that He was
crucified--for the crime of blasphemy, as the Jews supposed, but, that
as a matter of fact, He was offered as a sacrifice for the sins of
all who might have faith in Him; that He was raised from the dead and
ascended into heaven, where He now is, making intercession for His
followers; that He will forgive the sins of all who believe on Him,
and that those who do not believe will be consigned to the dungeons of
eternal pain.These--(it may be with the addition of the sacraments of
Baptism and the Last Supper)--constitute what is generally known as the
Christian religion.A Profound Change in the World of Thought

A profound change has taken place in the world of thought.The pews are
trying to set themselves somewhat above the pulpit.The layman discusses
theology with the minister, and smiles.Christians excuse themselves
for belonging to the church by denying a part of the creed.The idea
is abroad that they who know the most of nature believe the least about
theology.The sciences are regarded as infidels, and facts as scoffers.Thousands of most excellent people avoid churches, and, with few
exceptions, only those attend prayer meetings who wish to be alone.The
pulpit is losing because the people are rising.The Believer in the Inspiration of the Bible has too Much to Believe

But the believer in the inspiration of the Bible is compelled to declare
that there was a time when slavery was right--when men could buy and
women sell their babes.He is compelled to insist that there was a time
when polygamy was the highest form of virtue; when wars of extermination
were waged with the sword of mercy; when religious toleration was a
crime, and when death was the just penalty for having expressed an
honest thought.He must maintain that Jehovah is just as bad now as he
was four thousand years ago, or that he was just as good then as he is
now, but that human conditions have so changed that slavery, polygamy,
religious persecutions and wars of conquest are now perfectly devilish.Once they were right--once they were commanded by God himself; now, they
are prohibited.There has been such a change in the conditions of man
that, at the present time, the devil is in favor of slavery, polygamy,
religious persecution and wars of conquest.That is to say, the devil
entertains the same opinion to-day that Jehovah held four thousand
years ago, but in the meantime Jehovah has remained exactly the
same--changeless and incapable of change.A Frank Admission

It is most cheerfully admitted that a vast number of people not only
believe these things, but hold them in exceeding reverence, and imagine
them to be of the utmost importance to mankind.They regard the Bible as
the only light that God has given for the guidance of His children; that
it is the one star in nature's sky--the foundation of all morality, of
all law, of all order, and of all individual and national progress.They
regard it as the only means we have for ascertaining the will of God,
the origin of man, and the destiny of the soul.The mistake has hindered in countless ways the civilization of
man.The Bible Should be Better than any other Book

In all ages of which any record has been preserved, there have been
those who gave their ideas of justice, charity, liberty, love, and
law.Now, if the Bible is really the work of God, it should contain the
grandest and sublimest truths.It should, in all respects, excel the
works of man.Within that book should be found the best and loftiest
definitions of justice; the truest conceptions of human liberty; the
clearest outlines of duty; the tenderest, the highest, and the noblest
thoughts,--not that the human mind has produced, but that the human mind
is capable of receiving.Upon every page should be found the luminous
evidence of its divine origin.Unless it contains grander and more
wonderful things than man has written, we are not only justified in
saying, but we are compelled to say, that it was written by no being
superior to man.A Serious Charge

The Bible has been the fortress and the defense of nearly every crime.No civilized country could re-enact its laws.And in many respects its
moral code is abhorrent to every good and tender man.It is admitted,
however, that many of its precepts are pure, that many of its laws are
wise and just, and that many of its statements are absolutely true.If the Bible is Not Verbally Inspired, What Then?It may be said that it is unfair to call attention to certain bad things
in the Bible, while the good are not so much as mentioned.To this it
may be replied that a divine being would not put bad things in a book.Certainly a being of infinite intelligence, power, and goodness could
never fall below the ideal of "depraved and barbarous" man.It will not
do, after we find that the Bible upholds what we now call crimes, to say
that it is not verbally inspired.If the words are not inspired, what
is?It may be said that the thoughts are inspired.But this would
include only the thoughts expressed without words.If the ideas are
inspired, they must be contained in and expressed only by inspired
words; that is to say, the arrangement of the words, with relation to
each other, must have been inspired.A Hindu Example

Suppose that we should now discover a Hindu book of equal antiquity with
the Old Testament, containing a defense of slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution, would we regard it as evidence
that the writers were inspired by an infinitely wise and merciful God?A Test Fairly Applied

Suppose we knew that after "inspired" men had finished the Bible, the
devil had got possession of it and wrote a few passages, what part of
the sacred Scriptures would Christians now pick out as being probably
his work?Which of the following passages would naturally be selected
as having been written by the devil--"Love thy neighbor as thyself," or
"Kill all the males among the little ones, and kill every woman; but all
the women children keep alive for yourselves?"It will hardly be claimed at this day, that the passages in the
Bible upholding slavery, polygamy, war, and religious persecution are
evidences of the inspiration of that book.Suppose that there had been
nothing in the Old Testament upholding these crimes would any modern
Christian suspect that it was not inspired on account of that omission?Suppose that there had been nothing in the Old Testament but laws in
favor of these crimes, would any intelligent Christian now contend that
it was the work of the true God?Proofs of Civilization

We know that there was a time in the history of almost every nation when
slavery, polygamy, and wars of extermination were regarded as divine
institutions; when women were looked upon as beasts of burden, and when,
among some people, it was considered the duty of the husband to murder
the wife for differing with him on the subject of religion.Nations that
entertain these views to-day are regarded as savage, and, probably, with
the exception of the South Sea islanders, the Feejees, some citizens
of Delaware, and a few tribes in Central Africa, no human beings can be
found degraded enough to agree upon these subjects with the Jehovah of
the ancient Jews.The only evidence we have, or can have, that a
nation has ceased to be savage is the fact that it has abandoned these
doctrines.To every one, except the theologian, it is perfectly easy to
account for the mistakes, atrocities, and crimes of the past, by
saying that civilization is a slow and painful growth; that the moral
perceptions are cultivated through ages of tyranny, of want, of crime,
and of heroism; that it requires centuries for man to put out the eyes
of self and hold in lofty and in equal poise the scales of justice;
that conscience is born of suffering; that mercy is the child of the
imagination--of the power to put oneself in the sufferers place, and
that man advances only as he becomes acquainted with his surroundings,
with the mutual obligations of life, and learns to take advantage of the
forces of nature.A Persian Gospel

Do not misunderstand me.My position is that the cruel passages in
the Old Testament are not inspired; that slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution always have been, are, and
forever will be, abhorred and cursed by the honest, virtuous, and the
loving; that the innocent cannot justly suffer for the guilty, and that
vicarious vice and vicarious virtue are equally absurd; that eternal
punishment is eternal revenge; that only the natural can happen; that
miracles prove the dishonesty of the few and the credulity of the many;
and that, according to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, salvation does not
depend upon belief, nor the atonement, nor a "second birth," but that
these gospels are in exact harmony with the declaration of the great
Persian: "Taking the first footstep with the good thought, the second
with the good word, and the third with the good deed, I entered
paradise."The dogmas of the past no longer reach the level of the
highest thought, nor satisfy the hunger of the heart.While dusty
faiths, embalmed and sepulchered in ancient texts, remain the same,
the sympathies of men enlarge; the brain no longer kills its young; the
happy lips give liberty to honest thoughts; the mental firmament expands
and lifts; the broken clouds drift by; the hideous dreams, the foul,
misshapen children of the monstrous night, dissolve and fade.Man the Author of all Books

So far as we know, man is the author of all books.If a book had been
found on the earth by the first man, he might have regarded it as the
work of God; but as men were here a good while before any books were
found, and as man has produced a great many books, the probability is
that the Bible is no exception.God and Brahma

Can we believe that God ever said of any: "Let his children be
fatherless and his wife a widow; let his children be continually
vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also out of their desolate
places; let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the stranger
spoil his labor, let there be none to extend mercy unto him, neither let
there be any to favor his fatherless children."If he ever said these
words, surely he had never heard this line, this strain of music, from
the Hindu: "Sweet is the lute to those who have not heard the prattle of
their own children."Jehovah, "from the clouds and darkness of Sinai,"
said to the Jews: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me.... Thou
shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."Contrast this with the words put by the Hindu in the mouth of Brahma:
"I am the same to all mankind.They who honestly serve other gods,
involuntarily worship me.I am he who partaketh of all worship, and I
am the reward of all worshipers."The first, a
dungeon where crawl the things begot of jealous slime; the other, great
as the domed firmament inlaid with suns.Matthew, Mark, and Luke

And I here take occasion to say, that with most of the teachings of the
gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke I most heartily agree.The miraculous
parts must, of course, be thrown aside.I admit that the necessity of
belief, the atonement, and the scheme of salvation are all set forth
in the Gospel of John,--a gospel, in my opinion, not written until long
after the others.Christianity Takes no Step in Advance

All the languages of the world have not words of horror enough to
paint the agonies of man when the church had power.Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, Nero, Domitian, and Commodus were not as cruel, false,
and base as many of the Christian Popes.Opposite the names of these
imperial criminals write John the XII., Leo the VIII., Boniface the VII.,
Benedict the IX., Innocent the III., and Alexander the VI.Was it under
these pontiffs that the "church penetrated the moral darkness like a
new sun," and covered the globe with institutions of mercy?Rome was far
better when Pagan than when Catholic.It was better to allow gladiators
and criminals to fight than to burn honest men.The greatest of Romans
denounced the cruelties of the arena.Seneca condemned the combats even
of wild beasts.He was tender enough to say that "we should have a bond
of sympathy for all sentiment beings, knowing that only the depraved
and base take pleasure in the sight of blood and suffering."Aurelius
compelled the gladiators to fight with blunted swords.Roman lawyers
declared that all men are by nature free and equal.Woman, under Pagan
rule in Rome, become as free as man.Zeno, long before the birth of
Christ, taught that virtue alone establishes a difference between men.We know that the Civil Law is the foundation of our codes.We know that
fragments of Greek and Roman art--a few manuscripts saved from Christian
destruction, some inventions and discoveries of the Moors--were the
seeds of modern civilization.Christianity, for a thousand years,
taught memory to forget and reason to believe.Not one step was taken in
advance.Over the manuscripts of philosophers and poets, priests, with
their ignorant tongues thrust out, devoutly scrawled the forgeries of
faith.Christianity a Mixture of Good and Evil

Mr.Black attributes to me the following expression: "Christianity is
pernicious in its moral effect, darkens the mind, narrows the soul,
arrests the progress of human society, and hinders civilization."Strange, that he is only able to answer what I did
not say.I endeavored to show that the passages in the Old Testament
upholding slavery, polygamy, wars of extermination, and religious
intolerance had filled the world with blood and crime.I admitted
that there are many wise and good things in the Old Testament.I also
insisted that the doctrine of the atonement--that is to say, of moral
bankruptcy--the idea that a certain belief is necessary to salvation,
and the frightful dogma of eternal pain, had narrowed the soul, had
darkened the mind, and had arrested the progress of human society.Like
other religions, Christianity is a mixture of good and evil.The church
has made more orphans than it has fed.It has never built asylums enough
to hold the insane of its own making.Jehovah, Epictetus and Cicero

If the Bible is really inspired, Jehovah commanded the Jewish people to
buy the children of the strangers that sojourned among them, and ordered
that the children thus bought should be an inheritance for the children
of the Jews, and that they should be bondmen and bondwomen forever.Yet
Epictetus, a man to whom no revelation was ever made, a man whose soul
followed only the light of nature, and who had never heard of the Jewish
God, was great enough to say: "Will you not remember that your servants
are by nature your brothers, the children of God?In saying that you
have bought them, you look down on the earth and into the pit, on the
wretched law of men long since dead,--but you see not the laws of the
Gods."We find that Jehovah, speaking to his chosen people, assured them
that their bondmen and bondmaids must be "of the heathen that were
round about them.""Of them," said Jehovah, "shall ye buy bondmen
and bondmaids."And yet Cicero, a pagan, Cicero, who had never been
enlightened by reading the Old Testament, had the moral grandeur to
declare: "They who say that we should love our fellow-citizens, but not
foreigners, destroy the universal brotherhood of mankind, with which
benevolence and justice would perish forever."The Atonement

In countless ways the Christian world has endeavored, for nearly two
thousand years, to explain the atonement, and every effort has ended in
an an mission that it cannot be understood, and a declaration that it
must be believed.Is it not immoral to teach that man can sin, that he
can harden his heart and pollute his soul, and that, by repenting
and believing something that he does not comprehend, he can avoid the
consequences of his crimes?Has the promise and hope of forgiveness ever
prevented the commission of a sin?Should men be taught that sin gives
happiness here; that they ought to bear the evils of a virtuous life in
this world for the sake of joy in the next; that they can repent between
the last sin and the last breath; that after repentance every stain
of the soul is washed away by the innocent blood of another; that the
serpent of regret will not hiss in the ear of memory; that the saved
will not even pity the victims of their own crimes; that the goodness
of another can be transferred to them; and that sins forgiven cease to
affect the unhappy wretches sinned against?Sin as a Debt

The Church says that the sinner is in debt to God, and that the
obligation is discharged by the Saviour.The best that can possibly be
said of such a transaction is, that the debt is transferred, not paid.The truth is, that a sinner is in debt to the person he has injured.If a man injures his neighbor, it is not enough for him to get the
forgiveness of God, but he must have the forgiveness of his neighbor.If a man puts his hand in the fire and God forgives him, his hand will
smart exactly the same.You must, after all, reap what you sow.No god
can give you wheat when you sow tares, and no devil can give you tares
when you sow wheat.The Logic of the Coffin

As to the doctrine of the atonement, Mr.Black has nothing to offer
except the barren statement that it is believed by the wisest and the
best.A Mohammedan, speaking in Constantinople, will say the same of the
Koran.A Brahman, in a Hindu temple, will make the same remark, and so
will the American Indian, when he endeavors to enforce something upon
the young of his tribe.He will say: "The best, the greatest of our
tribe have believed in this."This is the argument of the cemetery, the
philosophy of epitaphs, the logic of the coffin.We are the greatest and
wisest and most virtuous of mankind?This statement, that it has been
believed by the best, is made in connection with an admission that it
cannot be fathomed by the wisest.It is not claimed that a thing is
necessarily false because it is not understood, but I do claim that
it is not necessarily true because it cannot be comprehended.I still
insist that "the plan of redemption," as usually preached, is absurd,
unjust, and immoral.Judas Iscariot

For nearly two thousand years Judas Iscariot has been execrated by
mankind; and yet, if the doctrine of the atonement is true, upon his
treachery hung the plan of salvation.Suppose Judas had known of this
plan--known that he was selected by Christ for that very purpose, that
Christ was depending on him.And suppose that he also knew that only
by betraying Christ could he save either himself or others; what ought
Judas to have done?Are you willing to rely upon an argument that
justifies the treachery of that wretch?The Standard of Right

According to Mr.Black, the man who does not believe in a supreme being
acknowledges no standard of right and wrong in this world, and therefore
can have no theory of rewards and punishments in the next.Is it
possible that only those who believe in the God who persecuted for
opinion's sake have any standard of right and wrong?Were the greatest
men of all antiquity without this standard?In the eyes of intelligent
men of Greece and Rome, were all deeds, whether good or evil, morally
alike?Is it necessary to believe in the existence of an infinite
intelligence before you can have any standard of right and wrong?Is it
possible that a being cannot be just or virtuous unless he believes in
some being infinitely superior to himself?If this doctrine be true, how
can God be just or virtuous?Does He believe in some being superior to
himself?If man were incapable of suffering, if man could not
feel pain, the word "conscience" never would have passed his lips.The
man who puts himself in the place of another, whose imagination has been
cultivated to the point of feeling the agonies suffered by another, is
the man of conscience.Black says, "We have neither jurisdiction or capacity to rejudge
the justice of God."In other words, we have no right to think upon
this subject, no right to examine the questions most vitally affecting
human-kind.We are simply to accept the ignorant statements of barbarian
dead.This question cannot be settled by saying that "it would be a
mere waste of time and space to enumerate the proofs which show that the
universe was created by a pre-existent and self-conscious being."The
time and space should have been "wasted," and the proofs should have
been enumerated.These "proofs" are what the wisest and greatest are
trying to find.It cares nothing
for the opinions of the "great," nothing for the prejudices of the many,
and least of all, for the superstitions of the dead.In the world of
science--a fact is a legal tender.Assertions and miracles are base and
spurious coins.We have the right to rejudge the justice even of a god.No one should throw away his reason--the fruit of all experience.It is
the intellectual capital of the soul, the only light, the only guide,
and without it the brain becomes the palace of an idiot king, attended
by a retinue of thieves and hypocrites.The Liberty of the Bible

This is the religious liberty of the Bible.If you had lived in
Palestine, and if the wife of your bosom, dearer to you than your
own soul, had said: "I like the religion of India better than that of
Palestine," it would have been your duty to kill her."Your eye must not
pity her, your hand must be first upon her, and afterwards the hand of
all the people."If she had said: "Let us worship the sun--the sun that
clothes the earth in garments of green--the sun, the great fireside of
the world--the sun that covers the hills and valleys with flowers--that
gave me your face, and made it possible for me to look into the eyes
of my babe,--let us worship the sun," it was your duty to kill her.You
must throw the first stone, and when against her bosom--a bosom filled
with love for you--you had thrown the jagged and cruel rock, and had
seen the red stream of her life oozing from the dumb lips of death,
you could then look up and receive the congratulations of the God whose
commandment you had obeyed.Is it possible that a being of infinite
mercy ordered a husband to kill his wife for the crime of having
expressed, an opinion on the subject of religion?Has there been found
upon the records of the savage world anything more perfectly fiendish
than this commandment of Jehovah?This is justified on the ground that
"blasphemy was a breach of political allegiance, and idolatry an act of
overt treason."We can understand how a human king stands in need of the
service of his people.We can understand how the desertion of any of
his soldiers weakens his army; but were the king infinite in power,
his strength would still remain the same, and under no conceivable
circumstances could the enemy triumph.Slavery in Heaven

According to Mr.Black, there will be slavery in Heaven, and fast by
the throne of God will be the auction-block, and the streets of the New
Jerusalem will be adorned with the whipping-post, while the music of
the harp will be supplemented by the crack of the driver's whip.Black, "incorporate him into his family,
tame him, teach him to think, and give him a knowledge of the true
principles of human liberty and government, he would confer upon him a
most beneficent boon."Black is too late with his protest against
the freedom of his fellow-men.Liberty is making the tour of the world.Russia has emancipated her serfs; the slave trade is prosecuted only
by thieves and pirates; Spain feels upon her cheek the burning blush
of shame; Brazil, with proud and happy eyes, is looking for the dawn of
freedom's day; the people of the South rejoice that slavery is no more,
and every good and honest man (excepting Mr.Black) of every land and
clime hopes that the limbs of men will never feel again the weary weight
of chains.Jehovah Breaking His Own Laws

A very curious thing about these Commandments is that their supposed
author violated nearly every one.From Sinai, according to the account,
He said: "Thou shalt not kill," and yet He ordered the murder of
millions; "Thou shalt not commit adultery," and He gave captured maidens
to gratify the lust of captors; "Thou shalt not steal," and yet He gave
to Jewish marauders the flocks and herds of others; "Thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's house, nor his wife," and yet He allowed His chosen
people to destroy the homes of neighbors and to steal their wives;
"Honor thy father and mother," and yet this same God had thousands of
fathers butchered, and with the sword of war killed children yet unborn;
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," and yet
He sent abroad "lying spirits" to deceive His own prophets, and in a
hundred ways paid tribute to deceit.So far as we know, Jehovah kept
only one of these Commandments--He worshiped no other god.I know as little as anyone else about the "pla" of the universe; and as
to the "design," I know just as little.It will not do to say that the
universe was designed, and therefore there must be a designer.There
must first be proof that it was "designed."It will not do to say that
the universe has a "plan," and then assert that there must have been an
infinite maker.The idea that a design must have a beginning, and that a
designer need not, is a simple expression of human ignorance.We find
a watch, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a thing must have had a
maker."We find the watchmaker, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a
thing as man must have had a maker."We find God and we then say: "He is
so wonderful that he must _not_ have had a maker."In other words, all
things a little wonderful must have been created, but it is possible for
something to be so wonderful that it always existed.One would suppose
that just as the wonder increased the necessity for a creator increased,
because it is the wonder of the thing that suggests the idea of
creation.Is it possible that a designer exists from all eternity
without design?Was there no design in having an infinite designer?For
me, it is hard to see the plan or design in earthquakes and pestilences.It is somewhat difficult to discern the design or the benevolence in so
making the world that billions of animals live only on the agonies of
others.The justice of God is not visible to me in the history of this
world.When I think of the suffering and death, of the poverty and
crime, of the cruelty and malice, of the heartlessness of this "design"
and "plan," where beak and claw and tooth tear and rend the quivering
flesh of weakness and despair, I cannot convince myself that it is the
result of infinite wisdom, benevolence, and justice.What we Know of the Infinite

Of course, upon a question like this, nothing can be absolutely known.We live on an atom called Earth, and what we know of the infinite is
almost infinitely limited; but, little as we know, all have an equal
right to give their honest thought.Life is a shadowy, strange,
and winding road on which we travel for a little way--a few short
steps--just from the cradle, with its lullaby of love, to the low and
quiet wayside inn, where all at last must sleep, and where the only
salutation is--Good-night.The Universe Self-Existent

The universe, according to my idea, is, always was, and forever will
be.It did not "come into being;" it is the one eternal being--the only
thing that ever did, does, or can exist.We know nothing of what we call the laws of Nature except as we gather
the idea of law from the uniformity of phenomena springing from like
conditions.To make myself clear: Water always runs down hill.The
theist says that this happens because there is behind the phenomenon an
active law.As a matter of fact law is this side of the phenomenon.Law
does not cause the phenomenon, but the phenomenon causes the idea of law
in our minds, and this idea is produced from the fact that under like
circumstances the same phenomena always happens.Black probably
thinks that the difference in the weight of rocks and clouds was created
by law; that parallel lines fail to imite only because it is illegal;
that diameter and circumference could have been so made that it would
be a greater distance across than around a circle, that a straight line
could inclose a triangle if not prevented by law, and that a little
legislation could make it possible for two bodies to occupy the same
space at the same time.It seems to me that law can not be the cause of
phenomena, but it is an effect produced in our minds by their succession
and resemblance.To put a God back of the universe compels us to admit
that there was a time when nothing existed except this God; that this
God had lived from eternity in an infinite vacuum and in an absolute
idleness.The mind of every thoughtful man is forced to one of these two
conclusions, either that the universe is self-existent or that it
was created by a self-existent being.To my mied there are far more
difficulties in the second hypothesis than in the first.Jehovah's Promise Broken

If Jehovah was in fact God, He knew the end from the beginning.He knew
that his Bible would be a breastwork behind which tyranny and hypocrisy
would crouch; that it would be quoted by tyrants; that it would be the
defense of robbers called kings and of hypocrites called priests.He
knew that He had taught the Jewish people but little of importance.He
knew that He found them free and left them captives.He knew that He
had never fulfilled the promises made to them.He knew that while other
nations had advanced in art and science his chosen people were savage
still.He promised them the world, and gave them a desert.He promised
them liberty, and He made them slaves.He promised them victory, and He
gave them defeat.He said they should be kings, and He made them
serfs.He promised them universal empire, and gave them exile.When one
finishes the Old Testament, he is compelled to say: Nothing can add to
the misery of a nation whose King is Jehovah!Character Bather than Creed

For a thousand years the torch of progress was extinguished in the blood
of Christ, and His disciples, moved by ignorant zeal, by insane, cruel
creeds, destroyed with flame and sword a hundred millions of their
fellow-men.But if cathedrals had been
universities--if dungeons of the Inquisition had been laboratories--if
Christians had believed in character instead of creed--if they had taken
from the Bible all the good and thrown away the wicked and absurd--if
domes of temples had been observatories--if priests had been
philosophers--if missionaries had taught the useful arts--if astrology
had been astronomy--if the black art had been chemistry--if superstition
had been science--if religion had been humanity--it would have been a
heaven filled with love, with liberty, and joy.Mohammed the Prophet of God

Mohammed was a poor man, a driver of camels.He was without education,
without influence, and without wealth, and yet in a few years he
consolidated thousands of tribes, and millions of men confess that there
is "one God, and Mohammed is his prophet."His success was a thousand
times greater during his life than that of Christ.He was not crucified;
he was a conqueror."Of all men, he exercised the greatest influence
upon the human race."Never in the world's history did a religion
spread with the rapidity of his.It burst like a storm over the fairest
portions of the globe.Black is right in his position that
rapidity is secured only by the direct aid of the Divine Being,
then Mohammed was most certainly the prophet of God.As to wars of
extermination and slavery, Mohammed agreed with Mr.Black, and upon
polygamy with Jehovah.As to religious toleration, he was great enough
to say that "men holding to any form of faith might be saved, provided
they were virtuous."In this he was far in advance both of Jehovah and
Mr.Wanted!--A Little More Legislation

We are informed by Mr.Black that "polygamy is neither commanded or
prohibited in the Old Testament--that it is only discouraged."It seems
to me that a little legislation on that subject might have tended to its
"discouragement."Black assures us "consists of certain immutable rules to govern the
conduct of all men at all times and at all places in their private and
personal relations with others," not one word is found on the subject of
polygamy.There is nothing "discouraging" in the Ten Commandments, nor
in the records of any conversation Jehovah is claimed to have had with
Moses upon Sinai.The life of Abraham, the story of Jacob and Laban,
the duty of a brother to be the husband of the widow of his deceased
brother, the life of David, taken in connection with the practice of
one who is claimed to have been the wisest of men--all these things are
probably relied on to show that polygamy was at least "discouraged."Certainly Jehovah had time to instruct Moses as to the infamy of
polygamy.He could have spared a few moments from a description of
patterns of tongs and basins for a subject so important as this.A
few-words in favor of the one wife and one husband--in favor of the
virtuous and loving home--might have taken the place of instructions
as to cutting the garments of priests and fashioning candlesticks and
ounces of gold.If he had left out simply the order that rams' skins
should be dyed red, and in its place had said, "A man shall have but one
wife, and the wife but one husband," how much better it would have been.Again, it is urged that "the acceptance of Christianity by a large
portion of the generation contemporary with its Founder and His
Apostles, was under the circumstances, an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."If this is true,
then "the acceptance of Buddhism by a large portion of the generation
contemporary with its Founder was an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."The same could
be said of Mohammedanism, and, in fact, of every religion that has
ever benefited or cursed this world.This argument, when reduced to its
simplest form, is this: All that succeeds is inspired.The Morality in Christianity

The morality in Christianity has never opposed the freedom of thought.It has never put, nor tended to put, a chain on a human mind, nor a
manacle on a human limb; but the doctrines distinctively Christian--the
necessity of believing a certain thing; the idea that eternal punishment
awaited him who failed to believe; the idea that the innocent can suffer
for the guilty--these things have |opposed, and for a thousand years
substantially destroyed the freedom of the human mind.All religions
have, with ceremony, magic, and mystery, deformed, darkened, and
corrupted, the soul.Around the sturdy oaks of morality have grown and
clung the parasitic, poisonous vines of the miraculous and monstrous.Irenaeus assures us that all Christians possessed the power of
working miracles; that they prophesied, cast out devils, healed the
sick, and even raised the dead.Epiphanius asserts that some rivers
and fountains were annually transmuted into wine, in attestation of the
miracle of Cana, adding that he himself had drunk of these fountains.Augustine declares that one was told in a dream where the bones of
St.Stephen were buried and the bones were thus discovered and brought
to Hippo, and that they raised five dead persons to life, and that in
two years seventy miracles were performed with these relics.Justin
Martyr states that God once sent some angels to guard the human race,
that these angels fell in love with the daughters of men, and became the
fathers of innumerable devils.For hundreds of years miracles were
about the only things that happened.They were wrought by thousands of
Christians, and testified to by millions.The saints and martyrs, the
best and greatest, were the witnesses and workers of wonders.Even
heretics, with the assistance of the devil, could suspend the "laws
of nature."Must we believe these wonderful accounts because they were
written by "good men," by Christians," who made their statements in the
presence and expectation of death"?The truth is that these "good men"
were mistaken.They fed their minds on prodigies, and their imaginations
feasted on effects without causes.Doubts were regarded as "rude disturbers of the congregation."Credulity
and sanctity walked hand in hand.As the philosophy of the ancients was rendered almost worthless by the
credulity of the common people, so the proverbs of Christ, his religion
of forgiveness, his creed of kindness, were lost in the mist of miracle
and the darkness of superstition.The Honor Due to Christ

For the man Christ--for the reformer who loved his fellow-men--for the
man who believed in an Infinite Father, who would shield the innocent
and protect the just--for the martyr who expected to be rescued from the
cruel cross, and who at last, finding that his rope was dust, cried out
in the gathering gloom of death; "My God!--for that great and suffering man, mistaken though he was, I have
the highest admiration and respect.That man did not, as I believe,
claim a miraculous origin; he did not pretend to heal the sick nor raise
the dead.He claimed simply to be a man, and taught his fellow-men
that love is stronger far than hate.His life was written by reverent
ignorance.Loving credulity belittled his career with feats of jugglery
and magic art, and priests wishing to persecute and slay, put in his
mouth the words of hatred and revenge.The theological Christ is the
impossible union of the human and divine--man with the attributes of
God, and God with the limitations and weakness of man.Christianity has no Monopoly in Morals

The morality of the world is not distinctively Christian.Zoroaster,
Gautama, Mohammed, Confucius, Christ, and, in fact, all founders of
religions, have said to their disciples: You must not steal; You must
not murder; You must not bear false witness; You must discharge your
obligations.Christianity is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the
miraculous origin of Jesus Christ, his crucifixion, his resurrection,
his ascension, the inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the
atonement, and the necessity of belief.Buddhism is the ordinary moral
code, _plus_ the miraculous illumination of Buddha, the performance of
certain ceremonies, a belief in the transmigration of the soul, and
in the final absorption of the human by the infinite.The religion of
Mohammed is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the belief that Mohammed
was the prophet of God, total abstinence from the use of intoxicating
drinks, a harem for the faithful here and hereafter, ablutions, prayers,
alms, pilgrimages, and fasts.Old Age in Superstition's Lap

And here I take occasion to thank Mr.Black for having admitted that
Jehovah gave no commandment against the practice of polygamy, that he
established slavery, waged wars of extermination, and persecuted for
opinions' sake even unto death, Most theologians endeavor to putty,
patch, and paint the wretched record of inspired crime, but Mr.Black
has been bold enough and honest enough to admit the truth.In this age
of fact and demonstration it is refreshing to find a man who believes
so thoroughly in the monstrous and miraculous, the impossible and
immoral--who still clings lovingly to the legends of the bib and
rattle--who through the bitter experiences of a wicked world has kept
the credulity of the cradle, and finds comfort and joy in thinking about
the Garden of Eden, the subtile serpent, the flood, and Babel's tower,
stopped by the jargon of a thousand tongues--who reads with happy eyes
the story of the burning brimstone storm that fell upon the cities
of the plain, and smilingly explains the transformation of the
retrospective Mrs.Lot--who laughs at Egypt's plagues and Pharaoh's
whelmed and drowning hosts--eats manna with the wandering Jews, warms
himself at the burning bush, sees Korah's company by the hungry earth
devoured, claps his wrinkled hands with glee above the heathens'
butchered babes, and longingly looks back to the patriarchal days of
concubines and slaves.How touching when the learned and wise crawl back
in cribs and ask to hear the rhymes and fables once again!How charming
in these hard and scientific times to see old age in Superstition's lap,
with eager lips upon her withered breast!Ararat in Chicago

A little while ago, in the city of Chicago, a gentleman addressed a
number of Sunday-school children.In his address he stated that some
people were wicked enough to deny the story of the deluge; that he was
a traveler; that he had been to the top of Mount Ararat, and had brought
with him a stone from that sacred locality.The children were then
invited to form in procession and walk by the pulpit, for the purpose of
seeing this wonderful stone.After they had looked at it, the lecturer
said: "Now, children, if you ever hear anybody deny the story of the
deluge, or say that the ark did not rest on Mount Ararat, you can tell
them that you know better, because you have seen with your own eyes a
stone from that very mountain."How Gods and Devils are Made

It was supposed that God demanded worship; that he loved to be
flattered; that he delighted in sacrifice; that nothing made him happier
than to see ignorant faith upon its knees; that above all things he
hated and despised doubters and heretics, and regarded investigation as
rebellion.Each community felt it a duty to see that the enemies of God
were converted or killed.To allow a heretic to live in peace was
to invite the wrath of God.Every public evil--every misfortune--was
accounted for by something the community had permitted or done.When
epidemics appeared, brought by ignorance and welcomed by filth, the
heretic was brought out and sacrificed to appease the anger of God.By putting intention behind what man called good, God was produced.By
putting intention behind what man called bad, the Devil was created.Leave this "intention" out, and gods and devils fade away.If not a
human being existed, the sun would continue to shine, and tempest now
and then would devastate the earth; the rain would fall in pleasant
showers; violets would spread their velvet bosoms to the sun, the
earthquake would devour, birds would sing, and daisies bloom, and
roses blush, and volcanoes fill the heavens with their lurid glare; the
procession of the seasons would not be broken, and the stars would shine
as serenely as though the world were filled with loving hearts and happy
homes.The Romance of Figures

How long, according to the universal benevolence of the New Testament,
can a man be reasonably punished in the next world for failing to
believe something unreasonable in this?Can it be possible that any
punishment can endure forever?Suppose that every flake of snow that
ever fell was a figure nine, and that the first flake was multiplied by
the second, and that product by the third, and so on to the last flake.And then suppose that this total should be multiplied by every drop of
rain that ever fell, calling each drop a figure nine; and that total by
each blade of grass that ever helped to weave a carpet for the earth,
calling each blade a figure nine; and that again by every grain of sand
on every shore, so that the grand total would make a line of nines so
long that it would require millions upon millions of years for light,
traveling at the rate of one hundred and eighty-five thousand miles per
second, to reach the end.And suppose, further, that each unit in this
almost infinite total, stood for billions of ages--still that vast and
almost endless time, measured by all the years beyond, is as one flake,
one drop, one leaf, one blade, one grain, compared with all the flakes,
and drops, and leaves, and blades and grains.Upon love's breast the
Church has placed the eternal asp.And yet, in the same book in which is
taught this most infamous of doctrines, we are assured that "The Lord is
good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works."God and Zeno

If the Bible is inspired, Jehovah, God of all worlds, actually said:
"And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under
his hand, he shall be surely punished; notwithstanding, if he continue
a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money."And yet
Zeno, founder of the Stoics, centuries before Christ was born, insisted
that no man could be the owner of another, and that the title was bad,
whether the slave had become so by conquest, or by purchase.Jehovah,
ordered a Jewish general to make war, and gave, among others, this
command: "When the Lord thy God shall drive them before thee, thou shalt
smite them and utterly destroy them."And yet Epictetus, whom we have
already quoted, gave this marvelous rule for the guidance of human
conduct: "Live with thy inferiors as thou wouldst have thy superiors
live with thee."If Christ was in fact God, he knew all the future.Before him, like a
panorama, moved the history yet to be.He knew exactly how his words
would be interpreted.He knew what crimes, what horrors, what infamies,
would be committed in his name.He knew that the fires of persecution
would climb around the limbs of countless martyrs.He knew that brave
men would languish in dungeons, in darkness, filled with pain; that the
church would use instruments of torture, that his followers would appeal
to whip and chain.He must have seen the horizon of the future red with
the flames of the _auto da fe_.He knew all the creeds that would spring
like poison fungi from every text.He saw the sects waging war against
each other.He saw thousands of men, under the orders of priests,
building dungeons for their fellow-men.He heard the groans, saw the faces white with agony, the tears,
the blood--heard the shrieks and sobs of all the moaning, martyred
multitudes.He knew that commentaries would be written on his words with
swords, to be read by the light of fagots.He knew that the Inquisition
would be born of teachings attributed to him.He saw all the
interpolations and falsehoods that hypocrisy would write and tell.He
knew that above these fields of death, these dungeons, these burnings,
for a thousand years would float the dripping banner of the cross.He
knew that in his name his followers would trade in human flesh, that
cradles would be robbed and women's breasts unbabed for gold;--and yet
he died with voiceless lips.Why did he not
tell his disciples, and through them the world, that man should not
persecute, for opinion's sake, his fellow-man?Why did he not cry, You
shall not persecute in my name; you shall not burn and torment those who
differ from you in creed?Why did he not plainly say, I am the Son of
God?Why did he not explain the doctrine of the trinity?Why did he not
tell the manner of baptism that was pleasing to him?Why did he not say
something positive, definite, and satisfactory about another world?Why
did he not turn the tear-stained hope of heaven to the glad knowledge
of another life?Why did he go dumbly to his death, leaving the world to
misery and to doubt?The Philosophy of Action

Consequences determine the quality of an action.If consequences are
good, so is the action.If actions had no consequences, they would be
neither good nor bad.Man did not get his knowledge of the consequences
of actions from God, but from experience and reason.If man can, by
actual experiment, discover the right and wrong of actions, is it not
utterly illogical to declare that they who do not believe in God can
have no standard of right and wrong?Consequences are the standard by
which actions are judged.They are the children that testify as to the
real character of their parents.God or no God, larceny is the enemy of
industry--industry is the mother of prosperity--prosperity is a good,
and therefore larceny is an evil.God or no God, murder is a crime.There has always been a law against larceny, because the laborer wishes
to enjoy the fruit of his toil.As long as men object to being killed,
murder will be illegal.I have insisted, and I still insist, that it is still impossible for
a finite man to commit a crime deserving infinite punishment; and upon
this subject Mr.Black admits that "no revelation has lifted the veil
between time and eternity;" and, consequently, neither the priest nor
the "policeman" knows anything with certainty regarding another world.He simply insists that "in shadowy figures we are warned that a very
marked distinction will be made between the good and bad in the next
world."There is "a very marked distinction" in this; but there is this
rainbow in the darkest human cloud: The worst have hope of reform.All I
insist is, if there is another life, the basest soul that finds its way
to that dark or radiant shore will have the everlasting chance of
doing right.Nothing but the most cruel ignorance, the most heartless
superstition, the most ignorant theology, ever imagined that the
few days of human life spent here, surrounded by mists and clouds of
darkness, blown over life's sea by storms and tempests of passion, fixed
for all eternity the condition of the human race.If this doctrine be
true, this life is but a net, in which Jehovah catches souls for hell.We are told that "there is no good reason to doubt that the statements
of the Evangelists, as we have them now, are genuine."The fact is, no
one knows who made the "statements of the Evangelists."There are three
important manuscripts upon which the Christian world relies."The first
appeared in the catalogue of the Vatican, in 1475.Of the New, it contains the four gospels,--the Acts, the
seven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the
Epistle to the Hebrews, so far as the fourteenth verse of the ninth
chapter,"--and nothing more."The
second, the Alexandrine, was presented to King Charles the First, in
1628.It contains the Old and New Testaments, with some exceptions;
passages are wanting in Matthew, in John, and in II.It
also contains the Epistle of Clemens Romanus, a letter of Athanasius,
and the treatise of Eusebius on the Psalms."The last is the Sinaitic
Codex, discovered about 1850, at the Convent of St."It contains the Old and New Testaments, and in addition
the entire Epistle of Barnabas, and a portion of the Shepherd of
Hennas--two books which, up to the beginning of the fourth century, were
looked upon by many as Scripture."In this manuscript, or codex, the
gospel of St.Mark concludes with the eighth verse of the sixteenth
chapter, leaving out the frightful passage: "Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature.He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."In
matters of the utmost importance these manuscripts disagree, but even if
they all agreed it would not furnish the slightest evidence of their
truth.It will not do to call the statements made in the gospels
"depositions," until it is absolutely established who made them, and the
circumstances under which they were made.Neither can we say that "they
were made in the immediate prospect of death," until we know who made
them.It is absurd to say that "the witnesses could not have been
mistaken, because the nature of the facts precluded the possibility of
any delusion about them."Can it be pretended that the witnesses could
not have been mistaken about the relation the Holy Ghost is alleged to
have sustained to Jesus Christ?Is there no possibility of delusion
about a circumstance of that kind?Did the writers of the four gospels
have "the sensible and true avouch of their own eyes and ears" in that
behalf?How was it possible for any one of the four Evangelists to know
that Christ was the Son of God, or that he was God?Matthew says that an angel of the Lord told
Joseph in a dream, but Joseph never wrote an account of this wonderful
vision.Luke tells us that the angel had a conversation with Mary, and
that Mary told Elizabeth, but Elizabeth never wrote a word.There is no
account of Mary, or Joseph, or Elizabeth, or the angel, having had any
conversation with Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, in which one word was
said about the miraculous origin of Jesus Christ.The persons who knew
did not write, so that the account is nothing but hearsay.Black pretend that such statements would be admitted as evidence in any
court?But how do we know that the disciples of Christ wrote a word of
the gospels?How do we know
that the writers of the gospels "were men of unimpeachable character?"Black's Admission

For the purpose of defending the character of his infallible God, Mr.Black is forced to defend religious intolerance, wars of extermination,
human slavery, and almost polygamy.He admits that God established
slavery; that he commanded his chosen people to buy the children of the
heathen; that heathen fathers and mothers did right to sell their girls
and boys; that God ordered the Jews to wage wars of extermination and
conquest; that it was right to kill the old and young; that God forged
manacles for the human brain; that he commanded husbands to murder their
wives for suggesting the worship of the sun or moon; and that every
cruel, savage passage in the Old Testament was inspired by him.Such is
a "policeman's" view of God.The Stars Upon the Door of France

Mr.Black justifies all the crimes and horrors, excuses all the tortures
of all the Christian years, by denouncing the cruelties of the French
Revolution.Thinking people will not hasten to admit that an infinitely
good being authorized slavery in Judea, because of the atrocities of the
French Revolution.They will remember the sufferings of the Huguenots.They will not forget
the countless cruelties of priest and king.They will not forget the
dungeons of the Bastile.They will know that the Revolution was an
effect, and that liberty was not the cause--that atheism was not the
cause.Behind the Revolution they will see altar and throne--sword and
fagot--palace and cathedral--king and priest--master and slave--tyrant
and hypocrite.They will see that the excesses, the cruelties, and
crimes were but the natural fruit of seeds the church had sown.Upon that cloud of war, black with
the myriad miseries of a thousand years, dabbled with blood of king and
queen, of patriot and priest, there was this bow: "Beneath the flag of
France all men are free."In spite of all the blood and crime, in spite
of deeds that seem insanely base, the People placed upon a Nation's brow
these stars:--Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--grander words than ever
issued from Jehovah's lips.A KIND WORD FOR JOHN CHINAMAN

On the 27th day of March, 1880, Messrs.Wright, Dickey, O'Conner, and
Murch, of the Select Committee appointed by Congress to "Consider
the causes of the present depression of labor," presented the majority
special report on Chinese Immigration.The following quotations are
excerpts from Col.R. G. Ingersoll's caustic review of that report.The Select Committee Afraid

These gentlemen are in great fear for the future of our most holy and
perfectly authenticated religion, and have, like faithful watchmen,
from the walls and towers of Zion, hastened to give the alarm.They have
informed Congress that "Joss has his temple of worship in the Chinese
quarters, in San Francisco.Within the walls of a dilapidated structure
is exposed to the view of the faithful the God of the Chinaman, and here
are his altars of worship, Here he tears up his pieces of paper; here he
offers up his prayers; here he receives his religious consolations,
and here is his road to the celestial land."That "Joss is located in a
long, narrow room, in a building in a back alley, upon a kind of altar;"
that "he is a wooden image, looking as much like an alligator as like a
human being;" that the Chinese "think there is such a place as heaven;"
that "all classes of Chinamen worship idols;" that "the temple is open
every day at all hours;" that "the Chinese have no Sunday;" that this
heathen god has "huge jaws, a big red tongue, large white teeth, a half
dozen arms, and big, fiery, eyeballs.About him are placed offerings of
meat, and other eatables--a sacrificial offering."The Gods of the Joss-House and Patmos

No wonder that these members of the committee were shocked at such a
god, knowing as they did, that the only true God was correctly described
by the inspired lunatic of Patmos in the following words: "And there sat
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of
Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps
with a golden girdle.His head and his hairs were white like wool, as
white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like
unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the
sound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out
of his mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword; and his countenance was as
the sun shining in his strength."Certainly, a large mouth, filled
with white teeth, is preferable to one used as the scabbard of a sharp,
two-edged sword.Why should these gentlemen object to a god with big
fiery eyeballs, when their own Deity has eyes like a flame of fire?A Little Too Late

Is it not a little late in the day to object to people because they
sacrifice meat and other eatables to their god?We all know, that for
thousands of years the "real" God was exceedingly fond of roasted meat;
that He loved the savor of burning flesh, and delighted in the perfume
of fresh warm blood.Christianity has a Fair Show in San Francisco

The world is also informed by these gentlemen that "the idolatry of
the Chinese produces a demoralizing effect upon our American youth by
bringing sacred things into disrespect and making religion a theme of
disgust and contempt."In San Francisco there are some three hundred
thousand people.Is it possible that a few Chinese can bring "our holy
religion" into disgust and contempt?In that city there are fifty times
as many churches as joss-houses.Scores of sermons are uttered every
week; religious books and papers are plentiful as leaves in autumn, and
somewhat dryer; thousands of bibles are within the reach of all.An Arrow from the Quiver of Satire

And there, too, is the example of a Christian city.Why should we send
missionaries to China, if we cannot convert the heathen when they come
here?When missionaries go to a foreign land the poor benighted people
have to take their word for the blessings showered upon a Christian
people; but when the heathen come here, they can see for themselves.What was simply a story becomes a demonstrated fact.They come in
contact with people who love their enemies.They see that in a Christian
land men tell the truth; that they will not take advantage of strangers;
that they are just and patient; kind and tender; and have no prejudice
on account of color, race or religion; that they look upon mankind as
brethren; that they speak of God as a Universal Father, and are
willing to work and even to suffer, for the good, not only of their own
countrymen, but of the heathen as well.All this the Chinese see and
know, and why they still cling to the religion of their country is, to
me, a matter of amazement.We Have no Religious System

I take this, the earliest opportunity, to inform these gentlemen
composing a majority of the committee, that we have in the United States
no "religious system;" that this is a secular government.That it has
no religious creed; that it does not believe nor disbelieve in a future
state of reward or punishment; that it neither affirms nor denies the
existence of a "living" God.Congress Nothing to Do with Religion

Congress has nothing to do with the religion of the people.Its members
are not responsible to God for the opinions of their constituents, and
it may tend to the happiness of the constituents for me to state that
they are in no way responsible for the religion of the members.Religion
is an individual, not a national matter.And where the nation interferes
with the right of conscience, the liberties of the people are devoured
by the monster Superstition.But I am astonished that four Christian statesmen, four members of
Congress in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, who seriously
object to people on account of their religious convictions, should
still assert that the very religion in which they believe--and the only
religion established by the living god-head of the American system--is
not adapted to the spiritual needs of one-third of the human race.It is
amazing that these four gentlemen have, in the defense of the Christian
religion, announced the discovery that it is wholly inadequate for
the civilization of mankind; that the light of the cross can never
penetrate the darkness of China; "that all the labors of the missionary,
the example of the good, the exalted character of our civilization, make
no impression upon the pagan life of the Chinese;" and that even
the report of this committee will not tend to elevate, refine and
Christianize the yellow heathen of the Pacific coast.In the name
of religion these gentlemen have denied its power and mocked at the
enthusiasm of its founder.Worse than this, they have predicted for the
Chinese a future of ignorance and idolatry in this world, and, if the
"American system" of religion is true, hell-fire in the next.Do not Trample on John Chinaman

Do not trample upon these people because they have a different
conception of things about which even this committee knows nothing.Give them the same privilege you enjoy of making a God after their own
fashion.Would you be willing
to have them remain, if one of their race, thousands of years ago, had
pretended to have seen God, and had written of him as follows: "There
went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth; coals
were kindled by it, * * * and he rode upon a cherub and did fly."Why
should you object to these people on account of their religion?Your
objection has in it the spirit of hate and intolerance.That spirit lighted the fagot, made the
thumb-screw, put chains upon the limbs, and lashes upon the backs of
men.The same spirit bought and sold, captured and kidnapped human
beings; sold babes, and justified all the horrors of slavery.Be Honest with the Chinese

If you wish to drive out the Chinese, do not make a pretext of religion.Do not pretend that you are trying to do God a favor.Injustice in his
name is doubly detestable.The assassin cannot sanctify his dagger by
falling on his knees, and it does not help a falsehood if it be uttered
as a prayer.Religion, used, to intensify the hatred of men toward men,
under the pretense of pleasing God, has cursed this world.An Honest Merchant the Best Missionary

I am almost sure that I have read somewhere that "Christ died for _all_
men," and that "God is no respecter of persons."It was once taught
that it was the duty of Christians to tell to all people the "tidings of
great joy."I have never believed these things myself, but have always
contended that an honest merchant was the best missionary.Commerce
makes friends, religion makes enemies; the one enriches, and the other
impoverishes; the one thrives best where the truth is told, the other
where falsehoods are believed.For myself, I have but little confidence
in any business, or enterprise, or investment, that promises dividends
only after the death of the stockholders.Good Words from Confucius

For the benefit of these four philosophers and prophets, I will give a
few extracts from the writings of Confucius that will, in my judgment,
compare favorably with the best passages of their report:

"My doctrine is that man must be true to the principles of his nature,
and the benevolent exercises of them toward others.""With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and with my bended arm
for a pillow, I still have joy.""Riches and honor acquired by injustice are to me but floating clouds.""The man who, in view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who, in view of
danger, forgets life; and who remembers an old agreement, however far
back it extends, such a man may be reckoned a complete man.""Recompense injury with justice, and kindness with kindness."There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's
life: Reciprocity is that word.The Ancient Chinese

When the ancestors of the four Christian Congressmen were barbarians,
when they lived in caves, gnawed bones, and worshiped dry snakes; the
infamous Chinese were reading these sublime sentences of Confucius.When
the forefathers of these Christian statesmen were hunting toads to
get the jewels out of their heads to be used as charms, the wretched
Chinamen were calculating eclipses, and measuring the circumference
of the earth.When the progenitors of these representatives of the
"American system of religion" were burning women charged with nursing
devils, these people "incapable of being influenced by the exalted
character of our civilization," were building asylums for the insane.The Chinese and Civil Service Reform

Neither should it be forgotten that, for thousands of years, the Chinese
have honestly practised the great principle known as civil service
reform--a something that even the administration of Mr.Hayes has
reached only through the proxy of promise.Invading China in the Name of Opium and Christ

The English battered down the door of China in the names of Opium and
Christ.This infamy was regarded as another triumph of the gospel.At last in self-defense the Chinese allowed Christians to touch their
shores.Their wise men, their philosophers, protested, and prophesied
that time would show that Christians could not be trusted.This re port
proves that the wise men were not only philosophers but prophets.Don't be Dishonest in the Name of God

Treat China as you would England.Change it if you will, according to the laws of nations, but on no
account excuse a breach of national faith by pretending that we are
dishonest for God's sake.CONCERNING CREEDS AND THE TYRANNY OF SECTS




482.Diversity of Opinion Abolished by Henry VIII

In the reign of Henry VIII--that pious and moral founder of the
apostolic Episcopal Church,--there was passed by the parliament
of England an act entitled, "An act for abolishing of diversity of
opinion."And in this act was set forth what a good Christian was
obliged to believe:

First, That in the sacrament was the real body and blood of Jesus
Christ.Second, That the body and blood of Jesus Christ was in the bread, and
the blood and body of Jesus Christ was in the wine.Fourth, That vows of chastity were of perpetual obligation.Fifth, That private masses ought to be continued; and,

Sixth, That auricular confession to a priest must be maintained.This creed was made by law, in order that all men might know just what
to believe by simply reading the statute.The Church hated to see the
people wearing out their brains in thinking upon these subjects.Spencer and Darwin Damned

According to the philosophy of theology, man has continued to degenerate
for six thousand years.To teach that there is that in nature which
impels to higher forms and grander ends, is heresy, of course.The
Deity will damn Spencer and his "Evolution," Darwin and his "Origin
of Species," Bastian and his "Spontaneous Generation," Huxley and his
"Protoplasm," Tyndall and his "Prayer Gauge," and will save those, and
those only, who declare that the universe has been cursed, from the
smallest atom to the grandest star; that everything tends to evil and to
that only, and that the only perfect thing in nature is the Presbyterian
Confession of Faith.The Dead do Not Persecute

Imagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The
end that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are
orthodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated
church.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,
side by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this
difference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois

The supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that
an unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not
be allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have
been murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other
witnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He
was liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to
contribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges
who decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any
court.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption
of the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored
to chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot

Now and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,
and has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious
get together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most
prophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the
tree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students

Thousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various
Churches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate
the phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only
object, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may
learn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in
the dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus
trained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,
he is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly
impossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you
think the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it
wrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,
that most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of
fear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy

A trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in
the Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it
still thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined
to prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are
shambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that
the Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with
force.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be
bound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and
dungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening

Fortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon
the Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and
sciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,
succumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,
but by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a
relic of the past.The cry of "heresy" has been growing fainter and
fainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination
have ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of
infants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist "Hoist with his own Petard."A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a
piece of friendly advice."Although you may disbelieve the bible," said
he, "you ought not to say so."Do
you believe the bible," said I. He replied, "Most assuredly."To which
I retorted, "Your answer conveys no information to me.You may be
following your own advice.Of
course a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be
particular about telling the truth himself."The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity

What a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human
heart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and
great were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother
bears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of
the natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;
that for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to
heaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling
in the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy

Whoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be
guilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name
given by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of
the hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and
who, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of
intellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet
used in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian
era, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment
inflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This
effort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the
salvation of the soul.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as
certainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They
do not say, "we _think_ this is so," but "we _know_ this is so."They do
not appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They
keep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing
has been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the
authority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly
sin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation
of superstition has always horrified the Church.By some unaccountable
infatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense
importance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will
forever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts
or denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.To practice
justice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some
incomprehensible creed.You must say, "Once one is three, and three
times one is one."The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to
believe, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church
as a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago

One hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have
perished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in
England, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves
in the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their
ears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads
branded.The Despotism of Faith

The despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian
countries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time
the same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,
in Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the
world, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the
assumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware

And what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says
a heretic, "Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your
children cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I
will hunt you to the very portals of the grave."Calvin's Petrified Heart

Luther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor
of his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified
heart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly
declared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the
founders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous
tenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily
inconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion
as to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Common sense
belongs exclusively to no tongue.Logic is not confined to, nor has it
been buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is
translated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue
of Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: "O Jupiter!He then added: "Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven
again, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you
were prostrate."The Tail of a Lion

There is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the
tail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think
and act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they
join something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party
can act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to
pay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself
about the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept

The fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The
fall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began
to have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the
congregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories
themselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short
of irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside
world was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while
the church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress

Christianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human
race.Across the highway of progress it has always been building
breastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,
dogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered
together behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of
malice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into
a deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
crowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of
hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you
will not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to
smilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not
been found.The Real Eden is Beyond

Nations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy
becomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the
years sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are
behind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for
knowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,
it will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men

Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,
Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and
women.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All
other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
given up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS




507.On which of the six days was he
created?Is it possible that God would make a successful
rival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what
a snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced
woman.He knew that if the serpent
got into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive
them out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he
himself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be
good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman
was a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to
take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it
not possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these
fables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God
take him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam
and Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not
acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's
reputation.Questions About the Ark

How was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what
was done with the filth?How were some
portions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others
kept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their
respective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,
and they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things
must have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept
up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the
slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the
plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate
rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and
so sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon
their health.Of course, all the polar
bears did not go.It could be confounded only by the
destruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at
that time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain
presiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak
the words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch
the brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in
the machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the
language of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man
to be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in
the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take
myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a
holy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,
candlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,
at the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put
any of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,
the Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,
that whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off
from his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot
believe it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
are?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
earth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters
happen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of
others?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a
legal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an
altar?Were the
stealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and
eloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these
things; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who
will burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who
burns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the
investigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,
laugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase
or decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an
eternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has
not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
entitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat
this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG

I do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the
clouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,
soil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every
heretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast
out and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give
his individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really
valuable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or
State solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically
we are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect
minds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give
up your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory
of reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,
the ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:
"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of
man."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,
but after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of
men and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the
human heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only
justice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the
same as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been
wet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne
have leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated
to excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his
existence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the
conditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what
would have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen
is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all
religions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our
right to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his
intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this
sense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own
in which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all
the gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;
they have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think
a man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long
time.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike
ourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than
servile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt
to ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any
time, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from
human speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of
the Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too
much thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the
sword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition
Science has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality
enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one
who had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the
moon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church.""On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and
success.INGERSOLL'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE

     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother
     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs
     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our
     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish
     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would
do for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were
falling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest
point; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,
using his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that
kisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured
with the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour
of all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a
sunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther
shore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every
life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment
jeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep
and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but
in the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic
souls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to
tears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly
gave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully
discharged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand
times I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a
temple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only
good, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only
religion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;
and were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom
to his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet
flowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,
and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless
lips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the
return of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that
these dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,
to do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR

     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were
     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran
     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the
great struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the
music of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We
see thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see
the pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those
assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the
great army of freedom.Some are
walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they
adore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as
they lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing
babes that are asleep.Some are parting with
mothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,
and say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand
waves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,
keeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the
great cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the
fields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory
fields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand
guard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with
them in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are
with them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,
the life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them
pierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in
the whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech
can never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden
in the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man
bowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
governed by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the
strokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through
tangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the
sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
brutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner
of the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting
shell.Instead of
slaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches
the auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see
homes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want
and crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They
are at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag
they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the
tearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of
the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less
palace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In
the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of
death.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for
the living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by
vermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother
of all abominations, the devil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva

The Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought

Prejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the
home.I believe in truth, in
investigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and
intelligence."Will Docthor O'Shaughnessy be King av Ireland?Sure
it's the wicked king he'd make, intirely.Don't let him, plaze, yer
Honor!"Have no fears, Eily,
alanna!O'Shaughnessy has come into his kingdom by this time, and I
wish him joy of it."With these words he clapped his scarlet cap on his head, and vanished
like the snuff of a candle.*       *       *       *       *

Now, just about this time Dr.Michael O'Shaughnessy was dismounting from
his gig at his own back door, after a long and weary drive.He thought
little, however, about his bodily fatigue, for his heart was full of joy
and triumph, his mind absorbed in dreams of glory.He could not even
contain his thoughts, but broke out into words, as he unharnessed the
rusty old pony."An' whin I coom to the palace, I'll knock three times wid the knocker;
or maybe there'll be a bell, loike the sheriff's house (bad luck to um!)And the gossoon'll open the dure, and--

"'Phwhat's yer arrind?'"'It's Queen Victory I'm wantin',' says I.'An' ye'll till her King
Michael av Ireland is askin' for her,' I says."Thin whin Victory hears that, she'll coom roonnin' down hersilf, to bid
me welkim; an' she'll take me oop to the best room, an'--

"'Sit down an the throne, King Michael,' says she.'The other cheers
isn't good enough for the loikes of ye,' says she."'Afther ye, ma'm,' says I, moinding me manners."'An' is there annythin' I can du for ye, to-day, King Michael?'says
she, whin we've sat down an the throne."An' I says, loight and aisy loike, all as if I didn't care, 'Nothin' in
loife, ma'm, I'm obleeged to ye, widout ye'd lind me the loan o' yer
Sunday crownd,' says I, 'be way av a patthern,' says I."An' says she--"

But at this moment the royal meditations were rudely broken in upon by a
wild shriek which resounded from the house.The door was flung violently
open, and Mrs.O'Shaughnessy rushed out like a mad woman."The colleen's gone, an' me niver
shtirrin' from her side!Och, wirra, wirra!It must be the
witches has taken her clane up chimley."O'Shaughnessy stood for a moment transfixed, glaring with speechless
rage at the unhappy woman; then rushing suddenly at her, he seized and
shook her till her teeth chattered together.he yelled, beside himself with rage and
disappointment."Ye've fell ashlape, an' laved her shlip out!Sorrow
seize ye, ye're always the black bean in me porridge!"Then flinging her
from him, he cried, "I don't care!I'll be king wid
what's in there now!"He paused before the door of the best room, lately poor Eily's prison,
to draw breath and to collect his thoughts.The door was closed, and
from within--hark!Waking suddenly from her nap, had she
failed to see the girl, who had perhaps been sleeping, too?At all
events the jewels were there, in shining heaps on the floor, as he had
last seen them, with thousands more covering the floor in every
direction,--a king's ransom in half a handful of them.He would be king
yet, even if the girl were gone.Cautiously he opened the door and
looked in, his eyes glistening, his mouth fairly watering at the thought
of all the splendor which would meet his glance.Captive was there none, yet the room was not empty.Jewels were there none, yet the floor was covered; covered with living
creatures,--toads, snakes, newts, all hideous and unclean reptiles that
hop or creep or wriggle.And as the wretched man stared, with open mouth
and glaring eye-balls, oh, horror!they were all hopping, creeping,
wriggling towards the open door,--towards him!With a yell beside which
his wife's had been a whisper, O'Shaughnessy turned and fled; but after
him--through the door, down the passage and out of the house--came
hopping, creeping, wriggling his myriad pursuers.stretch your long legs, and run like a hunted hare
over hill and dale, over moss and moor.They are close behind you; they
are catching at your heels; they come from every side, surrounding you!Fly, King O'Shaughnessy!The Green Men are
hunting you, if you could but know it, in sport and in revenge; and
three times they will chase you round County Kerry, for thrice three
days, till at last they suffer you to drop exhausted in a bog, and
vanish from your sight.Eily went home with her apron full of pearls and diamonds, to
tell her story again, and this time to be believed.And she grew up a
good woman and a rich woman; and she married the young Count of
Kilmoggan, and spoke diamonds and pearls all her life long,--at least
her husband said she did, and he ought to know.cried Toto, springing lightly into the barn, and waving a
basket round his head.Spanish, Dame Clucket, where
are you all?I want all the fresh eggs you can spare, please!directly-now-this-very-moment!"and the boy tossed his basket up in the
air and caught it again, and danced a little dance of pure enjoyment,
while he waited for the hens to answer his summons.Speckle and Dame Clucket, who had been having a quiet chat together
in the mow, peeped cautiously over the billows of hay, and seeing that
Toto was alone, bade him good-morning."I don't know about eggs, to-day, Toto!""I want to
set soon, and I cannot be giving you eggs every day.""Oh, but I haven't had any for two or three days!""And I
_must_ have some to-day.Good old Clucket, dear old Cluckety, give me
some, please!""Well, I never can refuse that boy, somehow!"said Dame Clucket, half to
herself; and Mrs.Speckle agreed with her that it could not be done.Indeed, it would have been hard to say "No!"to Toto at that moment, for
he certainly was very pleasant to look at.The dusty sunbeams came
slanting through the high windows, and fell on his curly head, his
ruddy-brown cheeks, and honest gray eyes; and as the eyes danced, and
the curls danced, and the whole boy danced with the dancing sunbeams,
why, what could two soft-hearted old hens do but meekly lead the way to
where their cherished eggs lay, warm and white, in their fragrant nests
of hay?"And what is to be done with them?"Speckle, as the last egg
disappeared into the basket."We are going to have a party
to-night,--a real party!Baldhead is coming, and Jim Crow, and
Ger-Falcon.And Granny and Bruin are making all sorts of good
things,--I'll bring you out some, if I can, dear old Speckly,--and these
eggs are for a custard, don't you see?""And <DW53> and I are decorating the kitchen," continued he; "and Cracker
is cracking the nuts and polishing the apples; and Pigeon Pretty and
Miss Mary are dusting the ornaments,--so you see we are all very busy
indeed.and off ran boy Toto, with his basket of eggs, leaving the
two old hens to scratch about in the hay, clucking rather sadly over the
memories of their own chickenhood, when they, too, went to parties,
instead of laying eggs for other people's festivities.In the cottage, what a bustle was going on!The grandmother was at her
pastry-board, rolling out paste, measuring and filling and covering, as
quickly and deftly as if she had had two pairs of eyes instead of none
at all.The bear, enveloped in a huge blue-checked apron, sat with a
large mortar between his knees, pounding away at something as if his
life depended on it.On the hearth sat the squirrel, cracking nuts and
piling them up in pretty blue china dishes; and the two birds were
carefully brushing and dusting, each with a pair of dusters which she
always carried about with her,--one pair gray, and the other soft brown.As for Toto and the raccoon, they were here, there, and everywhere, all
in a moment."Now, then, where are those greens?"called the boy, when he had
carefully deposited his basket of eggs in the pantry.replied <DW53>, appearing at the same moment from the
shed, dragging a mass of ground-pine, fragrant fir-boughs, and
alder-twigs with their bright coral-red berries."We will stand these
big boughs in the corners, Toto.The creeping stuff will go over the
looking-glass and round the windows."Yes, that will do very well," said Toto."We shall need steps, though,
to reach so high, and the step-ladder is broken.""Bruin will be the step-ladder.Stand up here,
Bruin, and make yourself useful."The good bear meekly obeyed, and the raccoon, mounting nimbly upon his
shoulders, proceeded to arrange the trailing creepers with much grace
and dexterity."This reminds me of some of our honey-hunts, old fellow!""Do you remember the famous one we had in the
autumn, a little while before we came here?""That was, indeed, a famous hunt!It gave us our whole winter's supply of honey.And we might have got
twice as much more, if it hadn't been for the accident.""Tell us about it," said Toto."I wasn't with you, you know; and then
came the moving, and I forgot to ask you."<DW53>, you see, had discovered this hive in a big oak-tree, hollow
from crotch to ground.He couldn't get at it alone, for the clever bees
had made it some way down inside the trunk, and he couldn't reach far
enough down unless some one held him on the outside.So we went
together, and I stood on my hind tip-toes, and then he climbed up and
stood on my head, and I held his feet while he reached down into the
hole."said the grandmother, "that was very dangerous, Bruin."Well, you see, dear Madam," replied the bear, apologetically, "it was
really the only way.I couldn't stand on <DW53>'s head and have him hold
_my_ feet, you know; and we couldn't give up the honey, the finest crop
of the season.So--"

"Oh, it was all right!""At least, it was at
first.There was such a quantity of honey,--pots and pots of it!--and
all of the very best quality.I took out comb after comb, laying them in
the crotch of the tree for safe-keeping till I was ready to go down.""But where were the bees all the time?"replied the raccoon, "buzzing about and making a
fine fuss.They tried to sting me, of course, but my fur was too much
for them.The only part I feared for was my nose, and that I had covered
with two or three thicknesses of mullein-leaves, tied on with stout
grass.But as ill-luck would have it, they found out Bruin, and began to
buzz about him, too.One flew into his eye, and he let my feet go for an
instant,--just just for the very instant when I was leaning down as far
as I could possibly stretch to reach a particularly fine comb.Up went
my heels, of course, and down went I.""My _dear_ <DW53>!do you mean--"

"I mean _down_, dear Madam!"repeated the raccoon, gravely,--"the very
downest down there was, I assure you.I fell through that hollow tree as
the falling star darts through the ambient heavens.Luckily there was a
soft bed of moss and rotten wood at the bottom, or I might not have had
the happiness of being here at this moment.As it was--"

"As it was," interrupted the bear, "I dragged him out by the tail
through the hole at the bottom.Indeed, he looked like a hive
himself, covered from head to foot with wax and honey, and a cloud of
bees buzzing about him.But he had a huge piece of comb in each paw, and
was gobbling away, eating honey, wax, bees and all, as if nothing had
happened.""Naturally," said the raccoon, "I am of a saving disposition, as you
know, and cannot bear to see anything wasted.It is not generally known
that bees add a slight pungent flavor to the honey, which is very
agreeable.he repeated, throwing his head back, and
screwing up one eye, to contemplate the arrangement he had just
completed."How is that, Toto; pretty, eh?""But, see here, if you keep Bruin there all
day, we shall never get through all we have to do.Jump down, that's a
good fellow, and help me to polish these tankards."When all was ready, as in due time it was, surely it would have been
hard to find a pleasanter looking place than that kitchen.The clean
white walls were hung with wreaths and garlands, while the great
fir-boughs in the corners filled the air with their warm, spicy
fragrance.Every bit of metal--brass, copper, or steel--was polished so
that it shone resplendent, giving back the joyous blaze of the crackling
fire in a hundred tiny reflections.The kettle was especially glorious,
and felt the importance of its position keenly."I trust you have no unpleasant feeling about this," it said to the
black soup-kettle."Every one cannot be beautiful, you know.If you are
useful, you should be content with that."Some have the fun, and some have the trouble!""My business is to make soup, and I make it.The table was covered with a snowy cloth, and set with glistening
crockery--white and blue--and clean shining pewter.The great tankard
had been brought out of its cupboard, and polished within an inch of its
life; while the three blue ginger-jars, filled with scarlet
alder-berries, looked down complacently from their station on the
mantelpiece.As for the floor, I cannot give you an idea of the
cleanness of it.When everything else was ready and in place, the bear
had fastened a homemade scrubbing-brush to each of his four feet, and
then executed a sort of furious scrubbing-dance, which fairly made the
house shake; and the result was a shining purity which vied with that
of the linen table-cloth, or the very kettle itself.And you should have seen the good bear, when his toilet was completed!The scrubbing-brushes had been applied to his own shaggy coat as well as
to the floor, and it shone, in its own way, with as much lustre as
anything else; and in his left ear was stuck a red rose, from the
monthly rose-bush which stood in the sunniest window and blossomed all
winter long.It is extremely uncomfortable to have a rose stuck in one's
ear,--you may try it yourself, and see how you like it; but Toto had
stuck it there, and nothing would have induced Bruin to remove it.And
you should have seen our Toto himself, carrying his own roses on his
cheeks, and enough sunshine in his eyes to make a thunder-cloud laugh!And you should have seen the great <DW53>, glorious in scarlet
neck-ribbon, and behind his ear (_not_ in it!<DW53> was not Bruin) a
scarlet feather, the gift of Miss Mary, and very precious.And you
should have seen the little squirrel, attired in his own bushy tail,
and rightly thinking that he needed no other adornment; and the parrot
and the wood-pigeon, both trim and elegant, with their plumage arranged
to the last point of perfection.Last of all, you should have seen the
dear old grandmother, the beloved Madam, with her snowy curls and cap
and kerchief; and the ebony stick which generally lived in a drawer and
silver paper, and only came out on great occasions.How proud Toto was
of his Granny!and how the others all stood around her, gazing with
wondering admiration at her gold-bowed spectacles (for those she usually
wore were of horn) and the large breastpin, with a weeping-willow
displayed upon it, which fastened her kerchief."Made out of your grandfather's tail, did you say, Toto?"said the bear,
in an undertone.cried the boy, half pettishly.Surely you might know by this time that we have no tails.""I beg your pardon,
Toto, boy.You are not really vexed with old Bruin?"Toto rubbed his curly head affectionately against the shaggy black one,
in token of amity, and the bear continued:--

"When Madam was a young grandmother, was she as beautiful as she is
now?""Why, yes, I fancy so," replied Toto."Only she wasn't a grandmother
then, you know."You never were
anything but a boy, were you?"When Granny
was young, she was a girl, you see.""I--do--_not_--believe it!I saw a girl once--many years ago; it squinted, and its hair was frowzy,
and it wore a hideous basket of flowers on its head,--a dreadful
creature!Madam never can have looked like _that_!"At this moment a knock was heard at the door.Toto flew to open it, and
with a beaming face ushered in the old hermit, who entered leaning on
his stick, with his crow perched on one shoulder and the hawk on the
other.What bows and
courtesies, and whisking of tails and flapping of wings!The hermit's
bow in greeting to the old lady was so stately that Master <DW53> was
consumed with a desire to imitate it; and in so doing, he stepped back
against the nose of the tea-kettle and burned himself, which caused him
to retire suddenly under the table with a smothered shriek.And the hawk and the pigeon, the raccoon and the crow,
the hermit and the bear, all shook paws and claws, and vowed that they
were delighted to see each other; and what is more, they really _were_
delighted, which is not always the case when such vows are made.Now, when all had become well acquainted, and every heart was prepared
to be merry, they sat down to supper; and the supper was not one which
was likely to make them less cheerful.For there was chicken and ham,
and, oh, such a mutton-pie!You never saw such a pie; the standing crust
was six inches high, and solid as a castle wall; and on that lay the
upper-crust, as lightly as a butterfly resting on a leaf; while inside
was store of good mutton, and moreover golden eggballs and tender little
onions, and gravy as rich as all the kings of the earth put together.and besides all that there was white bread like snow, and brown
bread as sweet as clover-blossoms, and jam and gingerbread, and apples
and nuts, and pitchers of cream and jugs of buttermilk.Truly, it does
one's heart good to think of such a supper, and I only wish that you and
I had been there to help eat it.However, there was no lack of hungry
mouths, with right good-will to keep their jaws at work, and for a time
there was little conversation around the table, but much joy and comfort
in the good victuals.The good grandmother ate little herself, though she listened with
pleasure to the stirring sound of knives and forks, which told her that
her guests were well and pleasantly employed.Presently the hermit
addressed her, and said:--

"Honored Madam, you will be glad to know that there has been a great
change in the weather during the past week.Truly, I think the spring is
at hand; for the snow is fast melting away, the sun shines with more
than winter's heat, and the air to-day is mild and soft."At these words there was a subdued but evident excitement among the
company.The raccoon and the squirrel exchanged swift and significant
glances; the birds, as if by one unconscious impulse, ruffled their
feathers and plumed themselves a little.But boy Toto's face fell, and
he looked at the bear, who, for his part, scratched his nose and looked
intently at the pattern on his plate."It has been a long, an unusually long, season," continued the hermit,
"though doubtless it has seemed much shorter to you in your cosey
cottage than to me in my lonely cavern.But I have lived the
forest-life long enough to know that some of you, my friends," and he
turned with a smile to the forest-friends, "must be already longing to
hear the first murmur of the greenwood spring, and to note in tree and
shrub the first signs of awakening life."There was a moment of silence, during which the raccoon shifted uneasily
on his seat, and looked about him with restless, gleaming eyes.Suddenly
the silence was broken by a singular noise, which made every one start.It was a long-drawn sound, something between a snort, a squeal, and a
snore; and it came from--where _did_ it come from?"It seemed to come," said the hawk, who sat facing the fire, "from the
wall near the fireplace."At this moment the sound was heard again, louder and more distinct, and
this time it certainly _did_ come from the wall,--or rather from the
cupboard in the wall, near the fireplace.Then came a muffled, scuffling sound, and finally
a shrill peevish voice cried, "Let me out!<DW53>, I
know your tricks; let me out, or I'll tell Bruin this minute!"The bear burst into a volcanic roar of laughter, which made the hermit
start and turn pale in spite of himself, and going to the cupboard he
drew out the unhappy woodchuck, hopelessly entangled in his worsted
covering, from which he had been vainly struggling to free himself.It seemed as they would never have done
laughing; while every moment the woodchuck grew more furious,--squeaking
and barking, and even trying to bite the mighty paw which held him.But
the wood-pigeon had pity on him, and with a few sharp pulls broke the
worsted net, and begged Bruin to set him down on the table.This being
done, Master Chucky found his nose within precisely half an inch of a
most excellent piece of dried beef, upon which he fell without more ado,
and stayed not to draw breath till the plate was polished clean and
dry.That made every one laugh again, and altogether they were very merry,
and fell to playing games and telling stories, leaving the woodchuck to
try the keen edge of his appetite upon every dish on the table.By-and-by, however, this gentleman could eat no more; so he wiped his
paws and whiskers, brushed his coat a little, and then joined in the
sport with right good-will.It was a pleasant sight to see the great bear blindfolded, chasing Toto
and <DW53> from one corner to another, in a grand game of blindman's buff;
it was pleasant to see them playing leap-frog, and spin-the-platter, and
many a good old-fashioned game besides.Then, when these sat down to
rest and recover their breath, what a treat it was to see the four birds
dance a quadrille, to the music of Toto's fiddle!How they fluttered and
sidled, and hopped and bridled!How gracefully Miss Mary courtesied to
the stately hawk; and how jealous the crow was of this rival, who stood
on one leg with such a perfect grace!altogether that was a party worth going to.And when late in the
evening it broke up, and the visitors started on their homeward walk,
all declared it was the merriest time they had yet had together, and all
wished that they might have many more such times.And yet each one knew
in his heart,--and grieved to know,--that it was the last, and that the
end was come.The woodchuck sounded, the next morning, the note
which had for days been vibrating in the hearts of all the wild
creatures, but which they had been loth to strike, for Toto's sake.I don't know what you are all
thinking of, to stay on here after you are awake.I smelt the wet earth
and the water, and the sap running in the trees, even in that dungeon
where you had put me.The young reeds will soon be starting beside the
pool, and it is my work to trim them and thin them out properly;
besides, I am going to dig a new burrow, this year.And the squirrel with a chuckle, and the wood-pigeon with a sigh, and
the raccoon with a strange feeling which he hardly understood, but
which was not all pleasure, echoed the words, "We must be off!"Only the
bear said nothing, for he was in the wood-shed, splitting kindling-wood
with a fury of energy which sent the chips flying as if he were a
saw-mill.So it came to pass that on a soft, bright day in April, when the sun was
shining sweetly, and the wind blew warm from the south, and the buds
were swelling on willow and alder, the party of friends stood around the
door of the little cottage, exchanging farewells, half merry, half sad,
and wholly loving."After all, it is hardly good-by!""We shall
be here half the time, just as we were last summer; and the other half,
Toto will be in the forest.But Bruin rubbed his nose with his right paw, and said nothing."And you will come to the forest, too, dear Madam!"cried the raccoon,
"will you not?You will bring the knitting and the gingerbread, and we
will have picnics by the pool, and you will learn to love the forest as
much as Toto does.But Bruin rubbed his nose with his left paw, and still said nothing."And when my nest is made, and my little ones are fledged," cooed the
wood-pigeon in her tender voice, "their first flight shall be to you,
dear Madam, and their first song shall tell you that they love you, and
that we love you, every day and all day.For we do love you; don't we,
Bruin?"But the bear only looked helplessly around him, and scratched his head,
and again said nothing."Well," said Toto, cheerily, though with a suspicion of a quiver in his
voice, "you are all jolly good fellows, and we have had a merry winter
together.Of course we shall miss you sadly, Granny and I; but as you
say, Cracker, we shall all see each other every day; and I am longing
for the forest, too, almost as much as you are.""Dear friends," said the blind grandmother, folding her hands upon her
stick, and turning her kindly face from one to the other of the
group,--"dear friends, merry and helpful companions, this has indeed
been a happy season that we have spent together.You have, one and all,
been a comfort and a help to me, and I think you have not been
discontented yourselves; still, the confinement has of course been
strange to you, and we cannot wonder that you pine for your free,
wildwood life.it is a mischievous paw, but it
has never played any tricks on me, and has helped me many and many a
time.My little Cracker, I shall miss your merry chatter as I sit at my
spinning-wheel.Mary, and Pigeon Pretty, let me stroke your soft
feathers once more, by way of 'good-by.'Woodchuck, I have seen little
of you, but I trust you have enjoyed your visit, in your own way."And now, last of all, Bruin!come here and let
me shake your honest, shaggy paw, and thank you for all that you have
done for me and for my boy.""Why, where _is_ Bruin?"cried Toto, starting and looking round; "surely
he was here a minute ago.But no deep voice was heard, roaring cheerfully, "Here, Toto boy!"No
shaggy form came in sight."He has gone on ahead, probably," said the raccoon; "he said something,
this morning, about not liking to say good-by.Come, you others, we must
follow our leader.And with many a backward glance, and many a wave of paw, or tail, or
fluttering wing, the party of friends took their way to the forest home.Boy Toto stood with his hands in his pockets, looking after them with
bright, wide-open eyes.He did not cry,--it was a part of Toto's creed
that boys did not cry after they had left off petticoats,--but he felt
that if he had been a girl, the tears might have come in spite of him.So he stared very hard, and puckered his mouth in a silent whistle, and
felt of the marbles in his pockets,--for that is always a soothing and
comforting thing to do."Toto, dear," said his grandmother, "do you think our Bruin is really
_gone_, without saying a word of farewell to us?"cried the old lady, putting her handkerchief
to her sightless eyes,--"very, very much grieved!If it had been <DW53>,
now, I should not have been so much surprised; but for Bruin, our
faithful friend and helper, to leave us so, seems--"

"_Hello!_" cried Toto, starting suddenly, "what is that noise?"on the quiet air came the sharp crashing sound
of an axe.I'll go--" and with that
he went, as if he had been shot out of a catapult.Rushing into the wood-shed, he caught sight of the well-beloved shaggy
figure, just raising the axe to deliver a fearful blow at an unoffending
log of wood.Flinging his arms round it (the figure, not the axe nor the
log), he gave it such a violent hug that bear and boy sat down suddenly
on the ground, while the axe flew to the other end of the shed.cried Toto, "we thought you were gone, without
saying a word to us.The bear rubbed his nose confusedly, and muttered something about "a few
more sticks in case of cold weather."But here Toto burst out laughing in spite of himself, for the shed was
piled so high with kindling-wood that the bear sat as it were at the
bottom of a pit whose sides of neatly split sticks rose high above his
head."There's kindling-wood enough here to
last us ten years, at the very least.She
thought--"

"There will be more butter to make, now, Toto, since that new calf has
come," said the bear, breaking in with apparent irrelevance."And that pig is getting too big for you to manage," continued Bruin, in
a serious tone."He was impudent to _me_ the other day, and I had to
take him up by the tail and swing him, before he would apologize.Now,
you _couldn't_ take him up by the tail, Toto, much less swing him, and
there is no use in your deceiving yourself about it.""No one could, except you, old
monster.But what _are_ you thinking about that for, now?Granny will think you are gone, after all."And catching the
bear by the ear, he led him back in triumph to the cottage-door, crying,
"Granny, Granny!Now give him a good scolding, please, for
frightening us so."She only stroked the shaggy black
fur, and said, "Bruin, dear!my good, faithful, true-hearted Bruin!I
could not bear to think that you had left me without saying good-by.But you would not have done it, would you,
Bruin?The bear looked about him distractedly, and bit his paw severely, as if
to relieve his feelings."At least, if I meant
to say good-by.I wouldn't say it, because I couldn't.But I don't mean
to say it,--I mean I don't mean to do it.If you don't want me in the
house,--being large and clumsy, as I am well aware, and ugly too,--I can
sleep out by the pump, and come in to do the work.But I cannot leave
the boy, please, dear Madam, nor you.And the calf wants attention, and
that pig _ought_ to be swung at least once a week, and--and--"

But there was no need of further speech, for Toto's arms were clinging
round his neck, and Toto's voice was shouting exclamations of delight;
and the grandmother was shaking his great black paw, and calling him
her best friend, her dearest old Bruin, and telling him that he should
never leave them.And, in fact, he never did leave them.He settled down quietly in the
little cottage, and washed and churned, baked and brewed, milked the cow
and kept the pig in order.Happy was the good bear, and happy was Toto,
in those pleasant days.For every afternoon, when the work was done,
they welcomed one or all of their forest friends; or else they sought
the green, beloved forest themselves, and sat beside the fairy pool, and
wandered in the cool green mazes where all was sweetness and peace, with
rustle of leaves and murmur of water, and chirp of bird and insect.But
evening found them always at the cottage door again, bringing their
woodland joyousness to the blind grandmother, making the kitchen ring
with laughter as they related the last exploits of the raccoon or the
squirrel, or described the courtship of the parrot and the crow.And if you had asked any of the three, as they sat together in the
porch, who was the happiest person in the world, why, Toto and the
Grandmother would each have answered, "I!"But Bruin, who had never
studied grammar, and knew nothing whatever about his nominatives and his
accusatives, would have roared with a thunder-burst of enthusiasm,

     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.Henty gives an account of the struggle between
Britain and France for supremacy in the North American continent.On the
issue of this war depended not only the destinies of North America, but
to a large extent those of the mother countries themselves.The fall of
Quebec decided that the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New
World; that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the
nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the English
language, and English literature, should spread right round the globe."It is not only a lesson in history as instructively as it is
     graphically told, but also a deeply interesting and often thrilling
     tale of adventure and peril by flood and field."--_Illustrated
     London News._


     +True to the Old Flag+: A Tale of the American War of Independence.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author has gone to the accounts of officers who took
part in the conflict, and lads will find that in no war in which
American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave with
greater courage and good conduct.The historical portion of the book
being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures with the redskins
on the shores of Lake Huron, a story of exciting interest is interwoven
with the general narrative and carried through the book."Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British
     soldiers during the unfortunate struggle against American
     emancipation.The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to
     our flag, falls among the hostile redskins in that very Huron
     country which has been endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye
     and Chingachgook."--_The Times._

carry him safely through an atmosphere of intrigue, crime, and
bloodshed.He contributes largely to the victories of the Venetians at
Porto d'Anzo and Chioggia, and finally wins the hand of the daughter of
one of the chief men of Venice."Every boy should read 'The Lion of St.Henty has never
     produced a story more delightful, more wholesome, or more
     vivacious."--_Saturday Review._

     price $1.00.The hero, a young English lad, after rather a stormy boyhood, emigrates
to Australia, and gets employment as an officer in the mounted police.A
few years of active work on the frontier, where he has many a brush with
both natives and bushrangers, gain him promotion to a captaincy, and he
eventually settles down to the peaceful life of a squatter.Henty has never published a more readable, a more carefully
     constructed, or a better written story than this."--_Spectator._


     +Under Drake's Flag+: A Tale of the Spanish Main.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.A story of the days when England and Spain struggled for the supremacy
of the sea.The heroes sail as lads with Drake in the Pacific
expedition, and in his great voyage of circumnavigation.The historical
portion of the story is absolutely to be relied upon, but this will
perhaps be less attractive than the great variety of exciting adventure
through which the young heroes pass in the course of their voyages."A book of adventure, where the hero meets with experience enough,
     one would think, to turn his hair gray."--_Harper's Monthly
     Magazine._

dangerous and responsible missions, in the discharge of which he passes
through the great sieges of the time.He ultimately settles down as Sir

     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.No portion of English history is more crowded with great events than
that of the reign of Edward III.Cressy and Poitiers; the destruction of
the Spanish fleet; the plague of the Black Death; the Jacquerie rising;
these are treated by the author in "St.The hero of
the story, although of good family, begins life as a London apprentice,
but after countless adventures and perils becomes by valor and good
conduct the squire, and at last the trusted friend of the Black Prince.Henty has developed for himself a type of historical novel for
     boys which bids fair to supplement, on their behalf, the historical
     labors of Sir Walter Scott in the land of fiction."--_The
     Standard._


     +Captain Kidd's Gold+: The True Story of an Adventurous Sailor Boy.By JAMES FRANKLIN FITTS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very idea of
buried treasure.A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy Portuguese
and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming
eyes--sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the Spanish
Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long, low schooner,
of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting trading craft.There were many famous sea rovers in their day, but none more celebrated
than Capt.Perhaps the most fascinating tale of all is Mr.Fitts'
true story of an adventurous American boy, who receives from his dying
father an ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious
way.The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a
certain island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure buried
there by two of Kidd's crew.The hero of this book, Paul Jones Garry, is
an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water New England ancestry, and
his efforts to reach the island and secure the money form one of the
most absorbing tales for our youth that has come from the press.+Captain Bayley's Heir+: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California.By
     G. A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.A frank, manly lad and his cousin are rivals in the heirship of a
considerable property.The former falls into a trap laid by the latter,
and while under a false accusation of theft foolishly leaves England for
America.He works his passage before the mast, joins a small band of
hunters, crosses a tract of country infested with Indians to the
Californian gold diggings, and is successful both as digger and trader.Henty is careful to mingle instruction with entertainment; and
     the humorous touches, especially in the sketch of John Holl, the
     Westminster dustman, Dickens himself could hardly have
     excelled."--_Christian Leader._


     +For Name and Fame+; or, Through Afghan Passes.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.An interesting story of the last war in Afghanistan.The hero, after
being wrecked and going through many stirring adventures among the
Malays, finds his way to Calcutta and enlists in a regiment proceeding
to join the army at the Afghan passes.He accompanies the force under
General Roberts to the Peiwar Kotal, is wounded, taken prisoner, carried
to Cabul, whence he is transferred to Candahar, and takes part in the
final defeat of the army of Ayoub Khan."The best feature of the book--apart from the interest of its
     scenes of adventure--is its honest effort to do justice to the
     patriotism of the Afghan people."--_Daily News._


     +Captured by Apes+: The Wonderful Adventures of a Young Animal
     Trainer.12mo, cloth, $1.00.The scene of this tale is laid on an island in the Malay Archipelago.Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of New York, sets
sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of living curiosities.The
vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo and young Garland, the sole
survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore on a small island, and captured
by the apes that overrun the place.The lad discovers that the ruling
spirit of the monkey tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he
identifies as Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with
whose instruction he had been especially diligent.The brute recognizes
him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former master
through the same course of training he had himself experienced with a
faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing is monkey
recollection.Very novel indeed is the way by which the young man
escapes death.Prentice has certainly worked a new vein on juvenile
fiction, and the ability with which he handles a difficult subject
stamps him as a writer of undoubted skill.+The Bravest of the Brave+; or, With Peterborough in Spain.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.There are few great leaders whose lives and actions have so completely
fallen into oblivion as those of the Earl of Peterborough.This is
largely due to the fact that they were overshadowed by the glory and
successes of Marlborough.His career as general extended over little
more than a year, and yet, in that time, he showed a genius for warfare
which has never been surpassed.Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work--to
     enforce the doctrine of courage and truth.Lads will read 'The
     Bravest of the Brave' with pleasure and profit; of that we are
     quite sure."--_Daily Telegraph._


     +The Cat of Bubastes+: A Story of Ancient Egypt.With
     full-page Illustrations.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story which will give young readers an unsurpassed insight into the
customs of the Egyptian people.Amuba, a prince of the Rebu nation, is
carried with his charioteer Jethro into slavery.They become inmates of
the house of Ameres, the Egyptian high-priest, and are happy in his
service until the priest's son accidentally kills the sacred cat of
Bubastes.In an outburst of popular fury Ameres is killed, and it rests
with Jethro and Amuba to secure the escape of the high-priest's son and
daughter."The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred
     cat to the perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very
     skillfully constructed and full of exciting adventures.It is
     admirably illustrated."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Washington at Monmouth+: A Story of Three Philadelphia Boys.By
     JAMES OTIS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon "whose mother conducted a
boarding-house which was patronized by the British officers;" Enoch
Ball, "son of that Mrs.Ball whose dancing school was situated on
Letitia Street," and little Jacob, son of "Chris, the Baker," serve as
the principal characters.The story is laid during the winter when Lord
Howe held possession of the city, and the lads aid the cause by
assisting the American spies who make regular and frequent visits from
Valley Forge.One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread
was scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless
prodigality shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in
feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army but a
few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger.The story
abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully drawn, and the
glimpses of Washington's soldiers which are given show that the work has
not been hastily done, or without considerable study.+For the Temple+: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem.With full-page Illustrations by S. J. SOLOMON.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.Henty here weaves into the record of Josephus an admirable and
attractive story.The troubles in the district of Tiberias, the march of
the legions, the sieges of Jotapata, of Gamala, and of Jerusalem, form
the impressive and carefully studied historic setting to the figure of
the lad who passes from the vineyard to the service of Josephus, becomes
the leader of a guerrilla band of patriots, fights bravely for the
Temple, and after a brief term of slavery at Alexandria, returns to his
Galilean home with the favor of Titus.Henty's graphic prose pictures of the hopeless Jewish
     resistance to Roman sway add another leaf to his record of the
     famous wars of the world."--_Graphic._


     +Facing Death+; or, The Hero of the Vaughan Pit.A Tale of the Coal
     Mines.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON
     BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00."Facing Death" is a story with a purpose.It is intended to show that a
lad who makes up his mind firmly and resolutely that he will rise in
life, and who is prepared to face toil and ridicule and hardship to
carry out his determination, is sure to succeed.The hero of the story
is a typical British boy, dogged, earnest, generous, and though
"shamefaced" to a degree, is ready to face death in the discharge of
duty."The tale is well written and well illustrated and there is much
     reality in the characters.If any father, clergyman, or
     schoolmaster is on the lookout for a good book to give as a present
     to a boy who is worth his salt, this is the book we would
     recommend."--_Standard._


     +Tom Temple's Career.+ By HORATIO ALGER.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Tom Temple, a bright, self-reliant lad, by the death of his father
becomes a boarder at the home of Nathan Middleton, a penurious insurance
agent.Though well paid for keeping the boy, Nathan and his wife
endeavor to bring Master Tom in line with their parsimonious habits.The
lad ingeniously evades their efforts and revolutionizes the household.As Tom is heir to $40,000, he is regarded as a person of some importance
until by an unfortunate combination of circumstances his fortune shrinks
to a few hundreds.He leaves Plympton village to seek work in New York,
whence he undertakes an important mission to California, around which
center the most exciting incidents of his young career.Some of his
adventures in the far west are so startling that the reader will
scarcely close the book until the last page shall have been reached.Alger's most fascinating style, and is bound to
please the very large class of boys who regard this popular author as a
prime favorite.+Maori and Settler+: A Story of the New Zealand War.With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.The Renshaws emigrate to New Zealand during the period of the war with
the natives.Wilfrid, a strong, self-reliant, courageous lad, is the
mainstay of the household.Atherton, a
botanist and naturalist of herculean strength and unfailing nerve and
humor.In the adventures among the Maoris, there are many breathless
moments in which the odds seem hopelessly against the party, but they
succeed in establishing themselves happily in one of the pleasant New
Zealand valleys."Brimful of adventure, of humorous and interesting conversation,
     and vivid pictures of colonial life."--_Schoolmaster._


     +Julian Mortimer+: A Brave Boy's Struggle for Home and Fortune.By
     HARRY CASTLEMON.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Here is a story that will warm every boy's heart.There is mystery
enough to keep any lad's imagination wound up to the highest pitch.The
scene of the story lies west of the Mississippi River, in the days when
emigrants made their perilous way across the great plains to the land of
gold.One of the startling features of the book is the attack upon the
wagon train by a large party of Indians.Our hero is a lad of uncommon
nerve and pluck, a brave young American in every sense of the word.He
enlists and holds the reader's sympathy from the outset.Surrounded by
an unknown and constant peril, and assisted by the unswerving fidelity
of a stalwart trapper, a real rough diamond, our hero achieves the most
happy results.Harry Castlemon has written many entertaining stories for

     +Mopsa the Fairy.+ By JEAN INGELOW.Ingelow is, to our mind, the most charming of all living
     writers for children, and 'Mopsa' alone ought to give her a kind of
     pre-emptive right to the love and gratitude of our young folks.It
     requires genius to conceive a purely imaginary work which must of
     necessity deal with the supernatural, without running into a mere
     riot of fantastic absurdity; but genius Miss Ingelow has and the
     story of 'Jack' is as careless and joyous, but as delicate, as a
     picture of childhood."--_Eclectic._

island of Java, from Samarang to the Sacred Mountain.In a land where
the Royal Bengal tiger runs at large; where the rhinoceros and other
fierce beasts are to be met with at unexpected moments; it is but
natural that the heroes of this book should have a lively experience.Hermon not only distinguishes himself by killing a full-grown tiger at
short range, but meets with the most startling adventure of the journey.There is much in this narrative to instruct as well as entertain the

gain a livelihood.While in his bunk, seasick, Ned Rogers hears the
captain and mate discussing their plans for the willful wreck of the
brig in order to gain the insurance.Once it is known he is in
possession of the secret the captain maroons him on Spider Island,

submerged in the sand, and overhauling the timbers for the purpose of
gathering material with which to build a hut finds a considerable amount
of treasure.Raising the wreck; a voyage to Havana under sail; shipping
there a crew and running for Savannah; the attempt of the crew to seize
the little craft after learning of the treasure on board, and, as a
matter of course, the successful ending of the journey, all serve to
make as entertaining a story of sea-life as the most captious boy could
desire.+Geoff and Jim+: A Story of School Life.Illustrated

all readers.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dan, The Newsboy, by Horatio Alger Jr.Even so, many a time, the most
elementary sieve, handled with a little logic, is enough to winnow the
confused mass of affirmations and to release the good grain of truth.The gibbet is oblique or vertical
indifferently; but the Mole, always fixed by a hinder limb to the top
of the twig, does not touch the soil; he hangs a few fingers'-breadths
from the ground, out of the sextons' reach.Will they scrape at the foot of the gibbet in
order to overturn it?By no means; and the ingenuous observer who
looked for such tactics would be greatly disappointed.No attention is
paid to the base of the support.It is not vouchsafed even a stroke of
the rake.Nothing is done to overturn it, nothing, absolutely nothing!It is by other methods that the Burying-beetles obtain the Mole.These decisive experiments, repeated under many different forms, prove
that never, never in this world do the Necrophori dig, or even give a
superficial scrape, at the foot of the gallows, unless the hanging body
touch the ground at that point.And, in the latter case, if the twig
should happen to fall, its fall is in nowise an intentional result, but
a mere fortuitous effect of the burial already commenced.What, then, did the owner of the Frog of whom Gledditsch tells us
really see?If his stick was overturned, the body placed to dry beyond
the assaults of the Necrophori must certainly have touched the soil: a
strange precaution against robbers and the damp!We may fittingly
attribute more foresight to the preparer of dried Frogs and allow him
to hang the creature some inches from the ground.In this case all my
experiments emphatically assert that the fall of the stake undermined
by the sextons is a pure matter of imagination.Yet another of the fine arguments in favour of the reasoning power of
animals flies from the light of investigation and founders in the
slough of error!I admire your simple faith, you masters who take
seriously the statements of chance-met observers, richer in imagination
than in veracity; I admire your credulous zeal, when, without
criticism, you build up your theories on such absurdities.The stake is henceforth planted vertically, but the
body hanging on it does not reach the base: a condition which suffices
to ensure that there is never any digging at this point.I make use of
a Mouse, who, by reason of her trifling weight, will lend herself
better to the insect's manoeuvres.The dead body is fixed by the
hind-legs to the top of the stake with a ligature of raphia.It hangs
plumb, in contact with the stick.Very soon two Necrophori have discovered the tit-bit.They climb up the
miniature mast; they explore the body, dividing its fur by thrusts of
the head.Here we
have again, but under far more difficult conditions, the tactics
employed when it was necessary to displace the unfavourably situated
body: the two collaborators slip between the Mouse and the stake, when,
taking a grip of the latter and exerting a leverage with their backs,
they jerk and shake the body, which oscillates, twirls about, swings
away from the stake and relapses.All the morning is passed in vain
attempts, interrupted by explorations on the animal's body.In the afternoon the cause of the check is at last recognized; not very
clearly, for in the first place the two obstinate riflers of the
gallows attack the hind-legs of the Mouse, a little below the ligature.They strip them bare, flay them and cut away the flesh about the heel.They have reached the bone, when one of them finds the raphia beneath
his mandibles.This, to him, is a familiar thing, representing the
gramineous fibre so frequent in the case of burial in grass-covered
soil.Tenaciously the shears gnaw at the bond; the vegetable fetter is
severed and the Mouse falls, to be buried a little later.If it were isolated, this severance of the suspending tie would be a
magnificent performance; but considered in connection with the sum of
the Beetle's customary labours it loses all far-reaching significance.Before attacking the ligature, which was not concealed in any way, the
insect exerted itself for a whole morning in shaking the body, its
usual method.Finally, finding the cord, it severed it, as it would
have severed a ligament of couch-grass encountered underground.Under the conditions devised for the Beetle, the use of the shears is
the indispensable complement of the use of the shovel; and the modicum
of discernment at his disposal is enough to inform him when the blades
of his shears will be useful.He cuts what embarrasses him with no more
exercise of reason than he displays when placing the corpse
underground.So little does he grasp the connection between cause and
effect that he strives to break the bone of the leg before gnawing at
the bast which is knotted close beside him.The difficult task is
attacked before the extremely simple.Difficult, yes, but not impossible, provided that the Mouse be young.I
begin again with a ligature of iron wire, on which the shears of the
insect can obtain no purchase, and a tender Mouselet, half the size of
an adult.This time a tibia is gnawed through, cut in two by the
Beetle's mandibles near the spring of the heel.The detached member
leaves plenty of space for the other, which readily slips from the
metallic band; and the little body falls to the ground.But, if the bone be too hard, if the body suspended be that of a Mole,
an adult Mouse, or a Sparrow, the wire ligament opposes an
insurmountable obstacle to the attempts of the Necrophori, who, for
nearly a week, work at the hanging body, partly stripping it of fur or
feather and dishevelling it until it forms a lamentable object, and at
last abandon it, when desiccation sets in.A last resource, however,
remains, one as rational as infallible.Of course, not one dreams of doing so.For the last time let us change our artifices.The top of the gibbet
consists of a little fork, with the prongs widely opened and measuring
barely two-fifths of an inch in length.With a thread of hemp, less
easily attacked than a strip of raphia, I bind together, a little above
the heels, the hind-legs of an adult Mouse; and between the legs I slip
one of the prongs of the fork.To make the body fall it is enough to
slide it a little way upwards; it is like a young Rabbit hanging in the
front of a poulterer's shop.Five Necrophori come to inspect my preparations.After a great deal of
futile shaking, the tibiae are attacked.This, it seems, is the method
usually employed when the body is retained by one of its limbs in some
narrow fork of a low-growing plant.While trying to saw through the
bone--a heavy job this time--one of the workers slips between the
shackled limbs.So situated, he feels against his back the furry touch
of the Mouse.Nothing more is needed to arouse his propensity to thrust
with his back.With a few heaves of the lever the thing is done; the
Mouse rises a little, slides over the supporting peg and falls to the
ground.Has the insect indeed perceived,
by the light of a flash of reason, that in order to make the tit-bit
fall it was necessary to unhook it by sliding it along the peg?Has it
really perceived the mechanism of suspension?I know some
persons--indeed, I know many--who, in the presence of this magnificent
result, would be satisfied without further investigation.More difficult to convince, I modify the experiment before drawing a
conclusion.I suspect that the Necrophorus, without any prevision of
the consequences of his action, heaved his back simply because he felt
the legs of the creature above him.With the system of suspension
adopted, the push of the back, employed in all cases of difficulty, was
brought to bear first upon the point of support; and the fall resulted
from this happy coincidence.That point, which has to be slipped along
the peg in order to unhook the object, ought really to be situated at a
short distance from the Mouse, so that the Necrophori shall no longer
feel her directly against their backs when they push.A piece of wire binds together now the tarsi of a Sparrow, now the
heels of a Mouse and is bent, at a distance of three-quarters of an
inch or so, into a little ring, which slips very loosely over one of
the prongs of the fork, a short, almost horizontal prong.To make the
hanging body fall, the slightest thrust upon this ring is sufficient;
and, owing to its projection from the peg, it lends itself excellently
to the insect's methods.In short, the arrangement is the same as it
was just now, with this difference, that the point of support is at a
short distance from the suspended animal.My trick, simple though it be, is fully successful.For a long time the
body is repeatedly shaken, but in vain; the tibiae or tarsi, unduly
hard, refuse to yield to the patient saw.Sparrows and Mice grow dry
and shrivelled, unused, upon the gibbet.Sooner in one case, later in
another, my Necrophori abandon the insoluble problem in mechanics: to
push, ever so little, the movable support and so to unhook the coveted
carcass.If they had had, but now, a lucid idea of
the mutual relations between the shackled limbs and the suspending peg;
if they had made the Mouse fall by a reasoned manoeuvre, whence comes
it that the present artifice, no less simple than the first, is to them
an insurmountable obstacle?For days and days they work on the body,
examine it from head to foot, without becoming aware of the movable
support, the cause of their misadventure.In vain do I prolong my
watch; never do I see a single one of them push it with his foot or
butt it with his head.Their defeat is not due to lack of strength.Like the Geotrupes, they
are vigorous excavators.Grasped in the closed hand, they insinuate
themselves through the interstices of the fingers and plough up your
skin in a fashion to make you very quickly loose your hold.With his
head, a robust ploughshare, the Beetle might very easily push the ring
off its short support.He is not able to do so because he does not
think of it; he does not think of it because he is devoid of the
faculty attributed to him, in order to support its thesis, by the
dangerous prodigality of transformism.Divine reason, sun of the intellect, what a clumsy slap in thy august
countenance, when the glorifiers of the animal degrade thee with such
dullness!Let us now examine under another aspect the mental obscurity of the
Necrophori.My captives are not so satisfied with their sumptuous
lodging that they do not seek to escape, especially when there is a
dearth of labour, that sovran consoler of the afflicted, man or beast.Internment within the wire cover palls upon them.So, the Mole buried
and all in order in the cellar, they stray uneasily over the wire-gauze
of the dome; they clamber up, descend, ascend again and take to flight,
a flight which instantly becomes a fall, owing to collision with the
wire grating.The sky is
superb; the weather is hot, calm and propitious for those in search of
the Lizard crushed beside the footpath.Perhaps the effluvia of the
gamy tit-bit have reached them, coming from afar, imperceptible to any
other sense than that of the Sexton-beetles.So my Necrophori are fain
to go their ways.Nothing would be easier if a glimmer of reason were to aid
them.Through the wire network, over which they have so often strayed,
they have seen, outside, the free soil, the promised land which they
long to reach.A hundred times if once have they dug at the foot of the
rampart.There, in vertical wells, they take up their station, drowsing
whole days on end while unemployed.If I give them a fresh Mole, they
emerge from their retreat by the entrance corridor and come to hide
themselves beneath the belly of the beast.The burial over, they
return, one here, one there, to the confines of the enclosure and
disappear beneath the soil.Well, in two and a half months of captivity, despite long stays at the
base of the trellis, at a depth of three-quarters of an inch beneath
the surface, it is rare indeed for a Necrophorus to succeed in
circumventing the obstacle, to prolong his excavation beneath the
barrier, to make an elbow in it and to bring it out on the other side,
a trifling task for these vigorous creatures.Of fourteen only one
succeeded in escaping.A chance deliverance and not premeditated; for, if the happy event had
been the result of a mental combination, the other prisoners,
practically his equals in powers of perception, would all, from first
to last, discover by rational means the elbowed path leading to the
outer world; and the cage would promptly be deserted.The failure of
the great majority proves that the single fugitive was simply digging
at random.Circumstances favoured him; and that is all.Do not let us
make it a merit that he succeeded where all the others failed.Let us also beware of attributing to the Necrophori an understanding
more limited than is usual in entomological psychology.I find the
ineptness of the undertaker in all the insects reared under the wire
cover, on the bed of sand into which the rim of the dome sinks a little
way.With very rare exceptions, fortuitous accidents, no insect has
thought of circumventing the barrier by way of the base; none has
succeeded in gaining the exterior by means of a slanting tunnel, not
even though it were a miner by profession, as are the Dung-beetles par
excellence.Captives under the wire dome, but desirous of escape,
Sacred Beetles, Geotrupes, Copres, Gymnopleuri, Sisyphi, all see about
them the freedom of space, the joys of the open sunlight; and not one
thinks of going round under the rampart, a front which would present no
difficulty to their pick-axes.Even in the higher ranks of animality, examples of similar mental
obfuscation are not lacking.Audubon relates how, in his days, the wild
Turkeys were caught in North America.In a clearing known to be frequented by these birds, a great cage was
constructed with stakes driven into the ground.In the centre of the
enclosure opened a short tunnel, which dipped under the palisade and
returned to the surface outside the cage by a gentle <DW72>, which was
open to the sky.The central opening, large enough to give a bird free
passage, occupied only a portion of the enclosure, leaving around it,
against the circle of stakes, a wide unbroken zone.A few handfuls of
maize were scattered in the interior of the trap, as well as round
about it, and in particular along the sloping path, which passed under
a sort of bridge and led to the centre of the contrivance.In short,
the Turkey-trap presented an ever-open door.The bird found it in order
to enter, but did not think of looking for it in order to return by it.According to the famous American ornithologist, the Turkeys, lured by
the grains of maize, descended the insidious <DW72>, entered the short
underground passage and beheld, at the end of it, plunder and the
light.A few steps farther and the gluttons emerged, one by one, from
beneath the bridge.The maize was abundant; and the Turkeys' crops grew swollen.When all was gathered, the band wished to retreat, but not one of the
prisoners paid any attention to the central hole by which he had
arrived.Gobbling uneasily, they passed again and again across the
bridge whose arch was yawning beside them; they circled round against
the palisade, treading a hundred times in their own footprints; they
thrust their necks, with their crimson wattles, through the bars; and
there, with beaks in the open air, they remained until they were
exhausted.Remember, inept fowl, the occurrences of a little while ago; think of
the tunnel which led you hither!If there be in that poor brain of
yours an atom of capacity, put two ideas together and remind yourself
that the passage by which you entered is there and open for your
escape!The light, an irresistible
attraction, holds you subjugated against the palisade; and the shadow
of the yawning pit, which has but lately permitted you to enter and
will quite as readily permit of your exit, leaves you indifferent.To
recognize the use of this opening you would have to reflect a little,
to evolve the past; but this tiny retrospective calculation is beyond
your powers.So the trapper, returning a few days later, will find a
rich booty, the entire flock imprisoned!Of poor intellectual repute, does the Turkey deserve his name for
stupidity?He does not appear to be more limited than another.Audubon
depicts him as endowed with certain useful ruses, in particular when he
has to baffle the attacks of his nocturnal enemy, the Virginian Owl.As
for his actions in the snare with the underground passage, any other
bird, impassioned of the light, would do the same.Under rather more difficult conditions, the Necrophorus repeats the
ineptness of the Turkey.When he wishes to return to the open daylight,
after resting in a short burrow against the rim of the wire cover, the
Beetle, seeing a little light filtering down through the loose soil,
reascends by the path of entry, incapable of telling himself that it
would suffice to prolong the tunnel as far in the opposite direction
for him to reach the outer world beyond the wall and gain his freedom.Here again is one in whom we shall seek in vain for any indication of
reflection.Like the rest, in spite of his legendary renown, he has no
guide but the unconscious promptings of instinct.To purge the earth of death's impurities and cause deceased animal
matter to be once more numbered among the treasures of life there are
hosts of sausage-queens, including, in our part of the world, the
Bluebottle (Calliphora vomitaria, Lin.)and the Grey Flesh-fly
(Sarcophaga carnaria, Lin.)Every one knows the first, the big,
dark-blue Fly who, after effecting her designs in the ill-watched
meat-safe, settles on our window-panes and keeps up a solemn buzzing,
anxious to be off in the sun and ripen a fresh emission of germs.How
does she lay her eggs, the origin of the loathsome maggot that battens
poisonously on our provisions whether of game or butcher's meat?What
are her stratagems and how can we foil them?This is what I propose to
investigate.The Bluebottle frequents our homes during autumn and a part of winter,
until the cold becomes severe; but her appearance in the fields dates
back much earlier.On the first fine day in February, we shall see her
warming herself, chillily, against the sunny walls.In April, I notice
her in considerable numbers on the laurustinus.It is here that she
seems to pair, while sipping the sugary exudations of the small white
flowers.The whole of the summer season is spent out of doors, in brief
flights from one refreshment-bar to the next.When autumn comes, with
its game, she makes her way into our houses and remains until the hard
frosts.This suits my stay-at-home habits and especially my legs, which are
bending under the weight of years.I need not run after the subjects of
my present study; they call on me.One and all bring me, in a little
screw of paper, the noisy visitor just captured against the panes.Thus do I fill my vivarium, which consists of a large, bell-shaped cage
of wire-gauze, standing in an earthenware pan full of sand.A mug
containing honey is the dining-room of the establishment.Here the
captives come to recruit themselves in their hours of leisure.To
occupy their maternal cares, I employ small birds--Chaffinches,
Linnets, Sparrows--brought down, in the enclosure, by my son's gun.I have just served up a Linnet shot two days ago.I next place in the
cage a Bluebottle, one only, to avoid confusion.Her fat belly
proclaims the advent of laying-time.An hour later, when the excitement
of being put in prison is allayed, my captive is in labour.With eager,
jerky steps, she explores the morsel of game, goes from the head to the
tail, returns from the tail to the head, repeats the action several
times and at last settles near an eye, a dimmed eye sunk into its
socket.The ovipositor bends at a right angle and dives into the junction of
the beak, straight down to the root.Then the eggs are emitted for
nearly half an hour.The layer, utterly absorbed in her serious
business, remains stationary and impassive and is easily observed
through my lens.A movement on my part would doubtless scare her; but
my restful presence gives her no anxiety.The discharge does not go on continuously until the ovaries are
exhausted; it is intermittent and performed in so many packets.Several
times over, the Fly leaves the bird's beak and comes to take a rest
upon the wire-gauze, where she brushes her hind-legs one against the
other.In particular, before using it again, she cleans, smooths and
polishes her laying-tool, the probe that places the eggs.Then, feeling
her womb still teeming, she returns to the same spot at the joint of
the beak.The delivery is resumed, to cease presently and then begin
anew.A couple of hours are thus spent in alternate standing near the
eye and resting on the wire-gauze.The Fly does not go back to the bird, a proof that
her ovaries are exhausted.The eggs are
dabbed in a continuous layer, at the entrance to the throat, at the
root of the tongue, on the membrane of the palate.Their number appears
considerable; the whole inside of the gullet is white with them.I fix
a little wooden prop between the two mandibles of the beak, to keep
them open and enable me to see what happens.I learn in this way that the hatching takes place in a couple of days.As soon as they are born, the young vermin, a swarming mass, leave the
place where they are and disappear down the throat.The beak of the bird invaded was closed at the start, as far as the
natural contact of the mandibles allowed.There remained a narrow slit
at the base, sufficient at most to admit the passage of a horse-hair.It was through this that the laying was performed.Lengthening her
ovipositor like a telescope, the mother inserted the point of her
implement, a point slightly hardened with a horny armour.The fineness
of the probe equals the fineness of the aperture.But, if the beak were
entirely closed, where would the eggs be laid then?With a tied thread I keep the two mandibles in absolute contact; and I
place a second Bluebottle in the presence of the Linnet, whom the
colonists have already entered by the beak.This time the laying takes
place on one of the eyes, between the lid and the eyeball.At the
hatching, which again occurs a couple of days later, the grubs make
their way into the fleshy depths of the socket.The eyes and the beak,
therefore, form the two chief entrances into feathered game.There are others; and these are the wounds.I cover the Linnet's head
with a paper hood which will prevent invasion through the beak and
eyes.I serve it, under the wire-gauze bell, to a third egg-layer.The
bird has been struck by a shot in the breast, but the sore is not
bleeding: no outer stain marks the injured spot.Moreover, I am careful
to arrange the feathers, to smooth them with a hair-pencil, so that the
bird looks quite smart and has every appearance of being untouched.She inspects the Linnet from end to end; with
her front tarsi she fumbles at the breast and belly.It is a sort of
auscultation by sense of touch.The insect becomes aware of what is
under the feathers by the manner in which these react.If scent lends
its assistance, it can only be very slightly, for the game is not yet
high.No drop of blood is near it, for it is
closed by a plug of down rammed into it by the shot.The Fly takes up
her position without separating the feathers or uncovering the wound.She remains here for two hours without stirring, motionless, with her
abdomen concealed beneath the plumage.My eager curiosity does not
distract her from her business for a moment.When she has finished, I take her place.There is nothing either on the
skin or at the mouth of the wound.I have to withdraw the downy plug
and dig to some depth before discovering the eggs.The ovipositor has
therefore lengthened its extensible tube and pushed beyond the feather
stopper driven in by the lead.The eggs are in one packet; they number
about three hundred.When the beak and eyes are rendered inaccessible, when the body,
moreover, has no wounds, the laying still takes place, but this time in
a hesitating and niggardly fashion.I pluck the bird completely, the
better to watch what happens; also, I cover the head with a paper hood
to close the usual means of access.For a long time, with jerky steps,
the mother explores the body in every direction; she takes her stand by
preference on the head, which she sounds by tapping on it with her
front tarsi.She knows that the openings which she needs are there,
under the paper; but she also knows how frail are her grubs, how
powerless to pierce their way through the strange obstacle which stops
her as well and interferes with the work of her ovipositor.The cowl
inspires her with profound distrust.Despite the tempting bait of the
veiled head, not an egg is laid on the wrapper, slight though it may
be.Weary of vain attempts to compass this obstacle, the Fly at last
decides in favour of other points, but not on the breast, belly, or
back, where the hide would seem too tough and the light too intrusive.She needs dark hiding-places, corners where the skin is very delicate.The spots chosen are the cavity of the axilla, corresponding with our
arm-pit, and the crease where the thigh joins the belly.Eggs are laid
in both places, but not many, showing that the groin and the axilla are
adopted only reluctantly and for lack of a better spot.With an unplucked bird, also hooded, the same experiment failed: the
feathers prevent the Fly from slipping into those deep places.Let us
add, in conclusion, that, on a skinned bird, or simply on a piece of
butcher's meat, the laying is effected on any part whatever, provided
that it be dark.It follows from all this that, to lay her eggs, the Bluebottle picks
out either naked wounds or else the mucous membranes of the mouth or
eyes, which are not protected by a skin of any thickness.The perfect efficiency of the paper bag, which prevents the inroads of
the worms through the eye-sockets or the beak, suggests a similar
experiment with the whole bird.It is a matter of wrapping the body in
a sort of artificial skin which will be as discouraging to the Fly as
the natural skin.Linnets, some with deep wounds, others almost intact,
are placed one by one in paper envelopes similar to those in which the
nursery-gardener keeps his seeds, envelopes just folded, without being
stuck.The paper is quite ordinary and of middling thickness.Torn
pieces of newspaper serve the purpose.These sheaths with the corpses inside them are freely exposed to the
air, on the table in my study, where they are visited, according to the
time of day, in dense shade and in bright sunlight.Attracted by the
effluvia from the dead meat, the Bluebottles haunt my laboratory, the
windows of which are always open.I see them daily alighting on the
envelopes and very busily exploring them, apprised of the contents by
the gamy smell.Their incessant coming and going is a sign of intense
cupidity; and yet none of them decides to lay on the bags.They do not
even attempt to slide their ovipositor through the slits of the folds.The favourable season passes and not an egg is laid on the tempting
wrappers.All the mothers abstain, judging the slender obstacle of the
paper to be more than the vermin will be able to overcome.This caution on the Fly's part does not at all surprise me: motherhood
everywhere has great gleams of perspicacity.What does astonish me is
the following result.The parcels containing the Linnets are left for a
whole year uncovered on the table; they remain there for a second year
and a third.The little birds
are intact, with unrumpled feathers, free from smell, dry and light,
like mummies.They have become not decomposed, but mummified.I expected to see them putrefying, running into sanies, like corpses
left to rot in the open air.On the contrary, the birds have dried and
hardened, without undergoing any change.What did they want for their
putrefaction?The maggot,
therefore, is the primary cause of dissolution after death; it is,
above all, the putrefactive chemist.A conclusion not devoid of value may be drawn from my paper game-bags.In our markets, especially in those of the South, the game is hung
unprotected from the hooks on the stalls.Larks strung up by the dozen
with a wire through their nostrils, Thrushes, Plovers, Teal,
Partridges, Snipe, in short, all the glories of the spit which the
autumn migration brings us, remain for days and weeks at the mercy of
the Flies.The buyer allows himself to be tempted by a goodly exterior;
he makes his purchase and, back at home, just when the bird is being
prepared for roasting, he discovers that the promised dainty is alive
with worms.There is nothing for it but to throw the
loathsome, verminous thing away.Everybody knows it, and nobody
thinks seriously of shaking off her tyranny: not the retailer, nor the
wholesale dealer, nor the killer of the game.What is wanted to keep
the maggots out?Hardly anything: to slip each bird into a paper
sheath.If this precaution were taken at the start, before the Flies
arrive, any game would be safe and could be left indefinitely to attain
the degree of ripeness required by the epicure's palate.Stuffed with olives and myrtleberries, the Corsican Blackbirds are
exquisite eating.We sometimes receive them at Orange, layers of them,
packed in baskets through which the air circulates freely and each
contained in a paper wrapper.They are in a state of perfect
preservation, complying with the most exacting demands of the kitchen.I congratulate the nameless shipper who conceived the bright idea of
clothing his Blackbirds in paper.There is, of course, a serious objection to this method of
preservation.In its paper shroud, the article is invisible; it is not
enticing; it does not inform the passer-by of its nature and qualities.There is one resource left which would leave the bird uncovered: simply
to case the head in a paper cap.The head being the part most menaced,
because of the mucous membrane of the throat and eyes, it would be
enough, as a rule, to protect the head, in order to keep off the Flies
and thwart their attempts.Let us continue to study the Bluebottle, while varying our means of
information.A tin, about four inches deep, contains a piece of
butcher's meat.The lid is not put in quite straight and leaves a
narrow slit at one point of its circumference, allowing, at most, of
the passage of a fine needle.When the bait begins to give off a gamy
scent, the mothers come, singly or in numbers.They are attracted by
the odour which, transmitted through a thin crevice, hardly reaches my
nostrils.They explore the metal receptacle for some time, seeking an entrance.Finding naught that enables them to reach the coveted morsel, they
decide to lay their eggs on the tin, just beside the aperture.Sometimes, when the width of the passage allows of it, they insert the
ovipositor into the tin and lay the eggs inside, on the very edge of
the slit.Whether outside or in, the eggs are dabbed down in a fairly
regular and absolutely white layer.We have seen the Bluebottle refusing to lay her eggs on the paper bag,
notwithstanding the carrion fumes of the Linnet enclosed; yet now,
without hesitation, she lays them on a sheet of metal.Can the nature
of the floor make any difference to her?I replace the tin lid by a
paper cover stretched and pasted over the orifice.With the point of my
knife I make a narrow slit in this new lid.That is quite enough: the
parent accepts the paper.What determined her, therefore, is not simply the smell, which can
easily be perceived even through the uncut paper, but, above all, the
crevice, which will provide an entrance for the vermin, hatched
outside, near the narrow passage.The maggots' mother has her own
logic, her prudent foresight.She knows how feeble her wee grubs will
be, how powerless to cut their way through an obstacle of any
resistance; and so, despite the temptation of the smell, she refrains
from laying, so long as she finds no entrance through which the
new-born worms can slip unaided.I wanted to know whether the colour, the shininess, the degree of
hardness and other qualities of the obstacle would influence the
decision of a mother obliged to lay her eggs under exceptional
conditions.With this object in view, I employed small jars, each
baited with a bit of butcher's meat.The respective lids were made of
different- paper, of oil-skin, or of some of that tin-foil,
with its gold or coppery sheen, which is used for sealing
liqueur-bottles.On not one of these covers did the mothers stop, with
any desire to deposit their eggs; but, from the moment that the knife
had made the narrow slit, all the lids were, sooner or later, visited
and all, sooner or later, received the white shower somewhere near the
gash.The look of the obstacle, therefore, does not count; dull or
brilliant, drab or : these are details of no importance; the
thing that matters is that there should be a passage to allow the grubs
to enter.Though hatched outside, at a distance from the coveted morsel, the
new-born worms are well able to find their refectory.As they release
themselves from the egg, without hesitation, so accurate is their
scent, they slip beneath the edge of the ill-joined lid, or through the
passage cut by the knife.Behold them entering upon their promised
land, their reeking paradise.Eager to arrive, do they drop from the top of the wall?Slowly creeping, they make their way down the side of the jar; they use
their fore-part, ever in quest of information, as a crutch and grapnel
in one.They reach the meat and at once instal themselves upon it.Let us continue our investigation, varying the conditions.A large
test-tube, measuring nine inches high, is baited at the bottom with a
lump of butcher's meat.It is closed with wire-gauze, whose meshes, two
millimetres wide (.078 inch.--Translator's Note.), do not permit of the
Fly's passage.The Bluebottle comes to my apparatus, guided by scent
rather than sight.She hastens to the test-tube, whose contents are
veiled under an opaque cover, with the same alacrity as to the open
tube.The invisible attracts her quite as much as the visible.She stays awhile on the lattice of the mouth, inspects it attentively;
but, whether because circumstances failed to serve me, or because the
wire network inspired her with distrust, I never saw her dab her eggs
upon it for certain.As her evidence was doubtful, I had recourse to
the Flesh-fly (Sarcophaga carnaria).This Fly is less finicking in her preparations, she has more faith in
the strength of her worms, which are born ready-formed and vigorous,
and easily shows me what I wish to see.She explores the trellis-work,
chooses a mesh through which she inserts the tip of her abdomen, and,
undisturbed by my presence, emits, one after the other, a certain
number of grubs, about ten or so.True, her visits will be repeated,
increasing the family at a rate of which I am ignorant.The new-born worms, thanks to a slight viscidity, cling for a moment to
the wire-gauze; they swarm, wriggle, release themselves and leap into
the chasm.It is a nine-inch drop at least.When this is done, the
mother makes off, knowing for a certainty that her offspring will shift
for themselves.If they fall on the meat, well and good; if they fall
elsewhere, they can reach the morsel by crawling.This confidence in the unknown factor of the precipice, with no
indication but that of smell, deserves fuller investigation.From what
height will the Flesh-fly dare to let her children drop?I top the
test-tube with another tube, the width of the neck of a claret-bottle.The mouth is closed either with wire-gauze or with a paper cover with a
slight cut in it.Altogether, the apparatus measures twenty-five inches
in height.No matter: the fall is not serious for the lithe backs of
the young grubs; and, in a few days, the test-tube is filled with
larvae, in which it is easy to recognize the Flesh-fly's family by the
fringed coronet that opens and shuts at the maggot's stern like the
petals of a little flower.I did not see the mother operating: I was
not there at the time; but there is no doubt possible of her coming,
nor of the great dive taken by the family: the contents of the
test-tube furnish me with a duly authenticated certificate.I admire the leap and, to obtain one better still, I replace the tube
by another, so that the apparatus now stands forty-six inches high.The
column is erected at a spot frequented by Flies, in a dim light.Its
mouth, closed with a wire-gauze cover, reaches the level of various
other appliances, test-tubes and jars, which are already stocked or
awaiting their colony of vermin.When the position is well-known to the
Flies, I remove the other tubes and leave the column, lest the visitors
should turn aside to easier ground.From time to time the Bluebottle and the Flesh-fly perch on the
trellis-work, make a short investigation and then decamp.Throughout
the summer season, for three whole months, the apparatus remains where
it is, without result: never a worm.Does the
stench of the meat not spread, coming from that depth?Certainly it
spreads: it is unmistakable to my dulled nostrils and still more so to
the nostrils of my children, whom I call to bear witness.Then why does
the Flesh-fly, who but now was dropping her grubs from a goodly height,
refuse to let them fall from the top of a column twice as high?Does
she fear lest her worms should be bruised by an excessive drop?There
is nothing about her to point to anxiety aroused by the length of the
shaft.I never see her explore the tube or take its size.She stands on
the trellised orifice; and there the matter ends.Can she be apprised
of the depth of the chasm by the comparative faintness of the offensive
odours that arise from it?Can the sense of smell measure the distance
and judge whether it be acceptable or not?The fact remains that, despite the attraction of the scent, the
Flesh-fly does not expose her worms to disproportionate falls.Can she
know beforehand that, when the chrysalids break, her winged family,
knocking with a sudden flight against the sides of a tall chimney, will
be unable to get out?This foresight would be in agreement with the
rules which order maternal instinct according to future needs.But, when the fall does not exceed a certain depth, the budding worms
of the Flesh-fly are dropped without a qualm, as all our experiments
show.This principle has a practical application which is not without
its value in matters of domestic economy.It is as well that the
wonders of entomology should sometimes give us a hint of commonplace
utility.The usual meat-safe is a sort of large cage with a top and bottom of
wood and four wire-gauze sides.Hooks fixed into the top are used
whereby to hang pieces which we wish to protect from the Flies.Often,
so as to employ the space to the best advantage, these pieces are
simply laid on the floor of the cage.With these arrangements, are we
sure of warding off the Fly and her vermin?We may protect ourselves against the Bluebottle, who is not
much inclined to lay her eggs at a distance from the meat; but there is
still the Flesh-fly, who is more venturesome and goes more briskly to
work and who will slip the grubs through a hole in the meshes and drop
them inside the safe.Agile as they are and well able to crawl, the
worms will easily reach anything on the floor; the only things secure
from their attacks will be the pieces hanging from the ceiling.It is
not in the nature of maggots to explore the heights, especially if this
implies climbing down a string in addition.People also use wire-gauze dish-covers.The trellised dome protects the
contents even less than does the meat-safe.The Flesh-fly takes no heed
of it.She can drop her worms through the meshes on the covered joint.We need only wrap the
birds which we wish to preserve--Thrushes, Partridges, Snipe and so
on--in separate paper envelopes; and the same with our beef and mutton.This defensive armour alone, while leaving ample room for the air to
circulate, makes any invasion by the worms impossible; even without a
cover or a meat-safe: not that paper possesses any special preservative
virtues, but solely because it forms an impenetrable barrier.The
Bluebottle carefully refrains from laying her eggs upon it and the
Flesh-fly from bringing forth her offspring, both of them knowing that
their new-born young are incapable of piercing the obstacle.Paper is equally successful in our strife against the Moths, those
plagues of our furs and clothes.To keep away these wholesale ravagers,
people generally use camphor, naphthalene, tobacco, bunches of
lavender, and other strong-scented remedies.Without wishing to malign
those preservatives, we are bound to admit that the means employed are
none too effective.The smell does very little to prevent the havoc of
the Moths.I would therefore advise our housewives, instead of all this chemist's
stuff, to use newspapers of a suitable shape and size.Take whatever
you wish to protect--your furs, your flannel, or your clothes--and pack
each article carefully in a newspaper, joining the edges with a double
fold, well pinned.If this joining is properly done, the Moth will
never get inside.Since my advice has been taken and this method
employed in my household, the old damage has no longer been repeated.A piece of meat is hidden in a jar under a layer
of fine, dry sand, a finger's-breadth thick.The jar has a wide mouth
and is left quite open.Let whoso come that will, attracted by the
smell.The Bluebottles are not long in inspecting what I have prepared
for them: they enter the jar, go out and come back again, inquiring
into the invisible thing revealed by its fragrance.A diligent watch
enables me to see them fussing about, exploring the sandy expanse,
tapping it with their feet, sounding it with their proboscis.I leave
the visitors undisturbed for a fortnight or three weeks.This is a repetition of what the paper bag, with its dead bird, showed
me.The Flies refuse to lay on the sand, apparently for the same
reasons.The paper was considered an obstacle which the frail vermin
would not be able to overcome.Its
grittiness would hurt the new-born weaklings, its dryness would absorb
the moisture indispensable to their movements.Later, when preparing
for the metamorphosis, when their strength has come to them, the grubs
will dig the earth quite well and be able to descend: but, at the
start, that would be very dangerous for them.Knowing these
difficulties, the mothers, however greatly tempted by the smell,
abstain from breeding.As a matter of fact, after long waiting, fearing
lest some packets of eggs may have escaped my attention, I inspect the
contents of the jar from top to bottom.Meat and sand contain neither
larvae nor pupae: the whole is absolutely deserted.The layer of sand being only a finger's-breadth thick, this experiment
requires certain precautions.The meat may expand a little, in going
bad, and protrude in one or two places.However small the fleshy eyots
that show above the surface, the Flies come to them and breed.Sometimes also the juices oozing from the putrid meat soak a small
extent of the sandy floor.That is enough for the maggot's first
establishment.These causes of failure are avoided with a layer of sand
about an inch thick.Then the Bluebottle, the Flesh-fly, and other
Flies whose grubs batten on dead bodies are kept at a proper distance.In the hope of awakening us to a proper sense of our insignificance,
pulpit orators sometimes make an unfair use of the grave and its worms.Let us put no faith in their doleful rhetoric.The chemistry of man's
final dissolution is eloquent enough of our emptiness: there is no need
to add imaginary horrors.The worm of the sepulchre is an invention of
cantankerous minds, incapable of seeing things as they are.Covered by
but a few inches of earth, the dead can sleep their quiet sleep: no Fly
will ever come to take advantage of them.At the surface of the soil, exposed to the air, the hideous invasion is
possible; aye, it is the invariable rule.For the melting down and
remoulding of matter, man is no better, corpse for corpse, than the
lowest of the brutes.Then the Fly exercises her rights and deals with
us as she does with any ordinary animal refuse.Nature treats us with
magnificent indifference in her great regenerating factory: placed in
her crucibles, animals and men, beggars and kings are 1 and all alike.There you have true equality, the only equality in this world of ours:
equality in the presence of the maggot.Drover Dingdong's Sheep followed the Ram which Panurge had maliciously
thrown overboard and leapt nimbly into the sea, one after the other,
"for you know," says Rabelais, "it is the nature of the sheep always to
follow the first, wheresoever it goes."The Pine caterpillar is even more sheeplike, not from foolishness, but
from necessity: where the first goes all the others go, in a regular
string, with not an empty space between them.They proceed in single file, in a continuous row, each touching with
its head the rear of the one in front of it.The complex twists and
turns described in his vagaries by the caterpillar leading the van are
scrupulously described by all the others.No Greek theoria winding its
way to the Eleusinian festivals was ever more orderly.Hence the name
of Processionary given to the gnawer of the pine.His character is complete when we add that he is a rope-dancer all his
life long: he walks only on the tight-rope, a silken rail placed in
position as he advances.The caterpillar who chances to be at the head
of the procession dribbles his thread without ceasing and fixes it on
the path which his fickle preferences cause him to take.The thread is
so tiny that the eye, though armed with a magnifying-glass, suspects it
rather than sees it.But a second caterpillar steps on the slender foot-board and doubles it
with his thread; a third trebles it; and all the others, however many
there be, add the sticky spray from their spinnerets, so much so that,
when the procession has marched by, there remains, as a record of its
passing, a narrow white ribbon whose dazzling whiteness shimmers in the
sun.Very much more sumptuous than ours, their system of road-making
consists in upholstering with silk instead of macadamizing.We sprinkle
our roads with broken stones and level them by the pressure of a heavy
steam-roller; they lay over their paths a soft satin rail, a work of
general interest to which each contributes his thread.Could they not, like other
caterpillars, walk about without these costly preparations?I see two
reasons for their mode of progression.It is night when the
Processionaries sally forth to browse upon the pine-leaves.They leave
their nest, situated at the top of a bough, in profound darkness; they
go down the denuded pole till they come to the nearest branch that has
not yet been gnawed, a branch which becomes lower and lower by degrees
as the consumers finish stripping the upper storeys; they climb up this
untouched branch and spread over the green needles.When they have had their suppers and begin to feel the keen night air,
the next thing is to return to the shelter of the house.Measured in a
straight line, the distance is not great, hardly an arm's length; but
it cannot be covered in this way on foot.The caterpillars have to
climb down from one crossing to the next, from the needle to the twig,
from the twig to the branch, from the branch to the bough and from the
bough, by a no less angular path, to go back home.It is useless to
rely upon sight as a guide on this long and erratic journey.The
Processionary, it is true, has five ocular specks on either side of his
head, but they are so infinitesimal, so difficult to make out through
the magnifying-glass, that we cannot attribute to them any great power
of vision.Besides, what good would those short-sighted lenses be in
the absence of light, in black darkness?It is equally useless to think of the sense of smell.Has the
Processional any olfactory powers or has he not?Without
giving a positive answer to the question, I can at least declare that
his sense of smell is exceedingly dull and in no way suited to help him
find his way.This is proved, in my experiments, by a number of hungry
caterpillars that, after a long fast, pass close beside a pine-branch
without betraying any eagerness of showing a sign of stopping.It is
the sense of touch that tells them where they are.So long as their
lips do not chance to light upon the pasture-land, not one of them
settles there, though he be ravenous.They do not hasten to food which
they have scented from afar; they stop at a branch which they encounter
on their way.Apart from sight and smell, what remains to guide them in returning to
the nest?In the Cretan labyrinth, Theseus
would have been lost but for the clue of thread with which Ariadne
supplied him.The spreading maze of the pine-needles is, especially at
night, as inextricable a labyrinth as that constructed for Minos.The
Processionary finds his way through it, without the possibility of a
mistake, by the aid of his bit of silk.At the time for going home,
each easily recovers either his own thread or one or other of the
neighbouring threads, spread fanwise by the diverging herd; one by one
the scattered tribe line up on the common ribbon, which started from
the nest; and the sated caravan finds its way back to the manor with
absolute certainty.Longer expeditions are made in the daytime, even in winter, if the
weather be fine.Our caterpillars then come down from the tree, venture
on the ground, march in procession for a distance of thirty yards or
so.The object of these sallies is not to look for food, for the native
pine-tree is far from being exhausted: the shorn branches hardly count
amid the vast leafage.Moreover, the caterpillars observe complete
abstinence till nightfall.The trippers have no other object than a
constitutional, a pilgrimage to the outskirts to see what these are
like, possibly an inspection of the locality where, later on, they mean
to bury themselves in the sand for their metamorphosis.It goes without saying that, in these greater evolutions, the guiding
cord is not neglected.All
contribute to it from the produce of their spinnerets, as is the
invariable rule whenever there is a progression.Not one takes a step
forward without fixing to the path the thread from his lips.If the series forming the procession be at all long, the ribbon is
dilated sufficiently to make it easy to find; nevertheless, on the
homeward journey, it is not picked up without some hesitation.For
observe that the caterpillars when on the march never turn completely;
to wheel round on their tight-rope is a method utterly unknown to them.In order therefore to regain the road already covered, they have to
describe a zigzag whose windings and extent are determined by the
leader's fancy.Hence come gropings and roamings which are sometimes
prolonged to the point of causing the herd to spend the night out of
doors.They collect into a motionless
cluster.To-morrow the search will start afresh and will sooner or
later be successful.Oftener still the winding curve meets the
guide-thread at the first attempt.As soon as the first caterpillar has
the rail between his legs, all hesitation ceases; and the band makes
for the nest with hurried steps.The use of this silk-tapestried roadway is evident from a second point
of view.To protect himself against the severity of the winter which he
has to face when working, the Pine Caterpillar weaves himself a shelter
in which he spends his bad hours, his days of enforced idleness.Alone,
with none but the meagre resources of his silk-glands, he would find
difficulty in protecting himself on the top of a branch buffeted by the
winds.A substantial dwelling, proof against snow, gales and icy fogs,
requires the cooperation of a large number.Out of the individual's
piled-up atoms, the community obtains a spacious and durable
establishment.Every evening, when the
weather permits, the building has to be strengthened and enlarged.It
is indispensable, therefore, that the corporation of workers should not
be dissolved while the stormy season continues and the insects are
still in the caterpillar stage.But, without special arrangements, each
nocturnal expedition at grazing-time would be a cause of separation.At
that moment of appetite for food there is a return to individualism.The caterpillars become more or less scattered, settling singly on the
branches around; each browses his pine-needle separately.How are they
to find one another afterwards and become a community again?The several threads left on the road make this easy.With that guide,
every caterpillar, however far he may be, comes back to his companions
without ever missing the way.They come hurrying from a host of twigs,
from here, from there, from above, from below; and soon the scattered
legion reforms into a group.The silk thread is something more than a
road-making expedient: it is the social bond, the system that keeps the
members of the brotherhood indissolubly united.At the head of every procession, long or short, goes a first
caterpillar whom I will call the leader of the march or file, though
the word leader, which I use for the want of a better, is a little out
of place here.Nothing, in fact, distinguishes this caterpillar from
the others: it just depends upon the order in which they happen to line
up; and mere chance brings him to the front.Among the Processionaries,
every captain is an officer of fortune.The actual leader leads;
presently he will be a subaltern, if the line should break up in
consequence of some accident and be formed anew in a different order.His temporary functions give him an attitude of his own.While the
others follow passively in a close file, he, the captain, tosses
himself about and with an abrupt movement flings the front of his body
hither and thither.As he marches ahead he seems to be seeking his way.Does he in point of fact explore the country?Does he choose the most
practicable places?Or are his hesitations merely the result of the
absence of a guiding thread on ground that has not yet been covered?His subordinates follow very placidly, reassured by the cord which they
hold between their legs; he, deprived of that support, is uneasy.Why cannot I read what passes under his black, shiny skull, so like a
drop of tar to look at?To judge by actions, there is here a modicum of
discernment which is able, after experimenting, to recognize excessive
roughnesses, over-slippery surfaces, dusty places that offer no
resistance and, above all, the threads left by other excursionists.This is all or nearly all that my long acquaintance with the
Processionaries has taught me as to their mentality.Poor brains,
indeed; poor creatures, whose commonwealth has its safety hanging upon
a thread!The finest that I have seen
manoeuvring on the ground measured twelve or thirteen yards and
numbered about three hundred caterpillars, drawn up with absolute
precision in a wavy line.But, if there were only two in a row the
order would still be perfect: the second touches and follows the first.By February I have processions of all lengths in the greenhouse.What
tricks can I play upon them?I see only two: to do away with the
leader; and to cut the thread.The suppression of the leader of the file produces nothing striking.If
the thing is done without creating a disturbance, the procession does
not alter its ways at all.The second caterpillar, promoted to captain,
knows the duties of his rank off-hand: he selects and leads, or rather
he hesitates and gropes.The breaking of the silk ribbon is not very important either.I remove
a caterpillar from the middle of the file.With my scissors, so as not
to cause a commotion in the ranks, I cut the piece of ribbon on which
he stood and clear away every thread of it.As a result of this breach,
the procession acquires two marching leaders, each independent of the
other.It may be that the one in the rear joins the file ahead of him,
from which he is separated by but a slender interval; in that case,
things return to their original condition.More frequently, the two
parts do not become reunited.In that case, we have two distinct
processions, each of which wanders where it pleases and diverges from
the other.Nevertheless, both will be able to return to the nest by
discovering sooner or later, in the course of their peregrinations, the
ribbon on the other side of the break.I have thought
out another, one more fertile in possibilities.I propose to make the
caterpillars describe a close circuit, after the ribbons running from
it and liable to bring about a change of direction have been destroyed.The locomotive engine pursues its invariable course so long as it is
not shunted on to a branch-line.If the Processionaries find the silken
rail always clear in front of them, with no switches anywhere, will
they continue on the same track, will they persist in following a road
that never comes to an end?What we have to do is to produce this
circuit, which is unknown under ordinary conditions, by artificial
means.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.The first idea that suggests itself is to seize with the forceps the
silk ribbon at the back of the train, to bend it without shaking it and
to bring the end of it ahead of the file.If the caterpillar marching
in the van steps upon it, the thing is done: the others will follow him
faithfully.The operation is very simple in theory but most difficult
in practice and produces no useful results.The ribbon, which is
extremely slight, breaks under the weight of the grains of sand that
stick to it and are lifted with it.If it does not break, the
caterpillars at the back, however delicately we may go to work, feel a
disturbance which makes them curl up or even let go.There is a yet greater difficulty: the leader refuses the ribbon laid
before him; the cut end makes him distrustful.Failing to see the
regular, uninterrupted road, he slants off to the right or left, he
escapes at a tangent.If I try to interfere and to bring him back to
the path of my choosing, he persists in his refusal, shrivels up, does
not budge, and soon the whole procession is in confusion.We will not
insist: the method is a poor one, very wasteful of effort for at best a
problematical success.We ought to interfere as little as possible and obtain a natural closed
circuit.It lies in our power, without the least
meddling, to see a procession march along a perfect circular track.I
owe this result, which is eminently deserving of our attention, to pure
chance.On the shelf with the layer of sand in which the nests are planted
stand some big palm-vases measuring nearly a yard and a half in
circumference at the top.The caterpillars often scale the sides and
climb up to the moulding which forms a cornice around the opening.This
place suits them for their processions, perhaps because of the absolute
firmness of the surface, where there is no fear of landslides, as on
the loose, sandy soil below; and also, perhaps, because of the
horizontal position, which is favourable to repose after the fatigue of
the ascent.It provides me with a circular track all ready-made.I have
nothing to do but wait for an occasion propitious to my plans.This
occasion is not long in coming.On the 30th of January, 1896, a little before twelve o'clock in the
day, I discover a numerous troop making their way up and gradually
reaching the popular cornice.Slowly, in single file, the caterpillars
climb the great vase, mount the ledge and advance in regular
procession, while others are constantly arriving and continuing the
series.I wait for the string to close up, that is to say, for the
leader, who keeps following the circular moulding, to return to the
point from which he started.My object is achieved in a quarter of an
hour.The closed circuit is realized magnificently, in something very
nearly approaching a circle.The next thing is to get rid of the rest of the ascending column, which
would disturb the fine order of the procession by an excess of
newcomers; it is also important that we should do away with all the
silken paths, both new and old, that can put the cornice into
communication with the ground.With a thick hair-pencil I sweep away
the surplus climbers; with a big brush, one that leaves no smell behind
it--for this might afterwards prove confusing--I carefully rub down the
vase and get rid of every thread which the caterpillars have laid on
the march.When these preparations are finished, a curious sight awaits
us.In the interrupted circular procession there is no longer a leader.Each caterpillar is preceded by another on whose heels he follows
guided by the silk track, the work of the whole party; he again has a
companion close behind him, following him in the same orderly way.And
this is repeated without variation throughout the length of the chain.None commands, or rather none modifies the trail according to his
fancy; all obey, trusting in the guide who ought normally to lead the
march and who in reality has been abolished by my trickery.From the first circuit of the edge of the tub the rail of silk has been
laid in position and is soon turned into a narrow ribbon by the
procession, which never ceases dribbling its thread as it goes.The
rail is simply doubled and has no branches anywhere, for my brush has
destroyed them all.What will the caterpillars do on this deceptive,
closed path?Will they walk endlessly round and round until their
strength gives out entirely?The old schoolmen were fond of quoting Buridan's Ass, that famous
Donkey who, when placed between two bundles of hay, starved to death
because he was unable to decide in favour of either by breaking the
equilibrium between two equal but opposite attractions.The Ass, who is no more foolish than any one else,
would reply to the logical snare by feasting off both bundles.Will my
caterpillars show a little of his mother wit?Will they, after many
attempts, be able to break the equilibrium of their closed circuit,
which keeps them on a road without a turning?Will they make up their
minds to swerve to this side or that, which is the only method of
reaching their bundle of hay, the green branch yonder, quite near, not
two feet off?I thought that they would and I was wrong.I said to myself:

"The procession will go on turning for some time, for an hour, two
hours, perhaps; then the caterpillars will perceive their mistake.They
will abandon the deceptive road and make their descent somewhere or
other."That they should remain up there, hard pressed by hunger and the lack
of cover, when nothing prevented them from going away, seemed to me
inconceivable imbecility.Facts, however, forced me to accept the
incredible.The circular procession begins, as I have said, on the 30th of January,
about midday, in splendid weather.The caterpillars march at an even
pace, each touching the stern of the one in front of him.The unbroken
chain eliminates the leader with his changes of direction; and all
follow mechanically, as faithful to their circle as are the hands of a
watch.The headless file has no liberty left, no will; it has become
mere clockwork.My success goes
far beyond my wildest suspicions.I stand amazed at it, or rather I am
stupefied.Meanwhile, the multiplied circuits change the original rail into a
superb ribbon a twelfth of an inch broad.I can easily see it
glittering on the red ground of the pot.The day is drawing to a close
and no alteration has yet taken place in the position of the trail.The trajectory is not a plane curve, but one which, at a certain point,
deviates and goes down a little way to the lower surface of the
cornice, returning to the top some eight inches farther.I marked these
two points of deviation in pencil on the vase at the outset.Well, all
that afternoon and, more conclusive still, on the following days, right
to the end of this mad dance, I see the string of caterpillars dip
under the ledge at the first point and come to the top again at the
second.Once the first thread is laid, the road to be pursued is
permanently established.If the road does not vary, the speed does.I measure nine centimetres
(3 1/2 inches.--Translator's Note.)But there are more or less lengthy halts; the pace slackens at
times, especially when the temperature falls.At ten o'clock in the
evening the walk is little more than a lazy swaying of the body.I
foresee an early halt, in consequence of the cold, of fatigue and
doubtless also of hunger.The caterpillars have come crowding from all
the nests in the greenhouse to browse upon the pine-branches planted by
myself beside the silken purses.Those in the garden do the same, for
the temperature is mild.The others, lined up along the earthenware
cornice, would gladly take part in the feast; they are bound to have an
appetite after a ten hours' walk.The branch stands green and tempting
not a hand's-breadth away.To reach it they need but go down; and the
poor wretches, foolish slaves of their ribbon that they are, cannot
make up their minds to do so.I leave the famished ones at half-past
ten, persuaded that they will take counsel with their pillow and that
on the morrow things will have resumed their ordinary course.I was expecting too much of them when I accorded them that
faint gleam of intelligence which the tribulations of a distressful
stomach ought, one would think, to have aroused.They are lined up as on the day before, but motionless.When the air
grows a little warmer, they shake off their torpor, revive and start
walking again.The circular procession begins anew, like that which I
have already seen.There is nothing more and nothing less to be noted
in their machine-like obstinacy.A cold snap has supervened, was indeed
foretold in the evening by the garden caterpillars, who refused to come
out despite appearances which to my duller senses seemed to promise a
continuation of the fine weather.At daybreak the rosemary-walks are
all asparkle with rime and for the second time this year there is a
sharp frost.The large pond in the garden is frozen over.What can the
caterpillars in the conservatory be doing?All are ensconced in their nests, except the stubborn processionists on
the edge of the vase, who, deprived of shelter as they are, seem to
have spent a very bad night.I find them clustered in two heaps,
without any attempt at order.They have suffered less from the cold,
thus huddled together.'Tis an ill wind that blows nobody any good.The severity of the night
has caused the ring to break into two segments which will, perhaps,
afford a chance of safety.Each group, as it survives and resumes its
walk, will presently be headed by a leader who, not being obliged to
follow a caterpillar in front of him, will possess some liberty of
movement and perhaps be able to make the procession swerve to one side.Remember that, in the ordinary processions, the caterpillar walking
ahead acts as a scout.While the others, if nothing occurs to create
excitement, keep to their ranks, he attends to his duties as a leader
and is continually turning his head to this side and that,
investigating, seeking, groping, making his choice.And things happen
as he decides: the band follows him faithfully.Remember also that,
even on a road which has already been travelled and beribboned, the
guiding caterpillar continues to explore.There is reason to believe that the Processionaries who have lost their
way on the ledge will find a chance of safety here.On recovering from their torpor, the two groups line up by degrees into
two distinct files.There are therefore two leaders, free to go where
they please, independent of each other.Will they succeed in leaving
the enchanted circle?At the sight of their large black heads swaying
anxiously from side to side, I am inclined to think so for a moment.As the ranks fill out, the two sections of
the chain meet and the circle is reconstituted.The momentary leaders
once more become simple subordinates; and again the caterpillars march
round and round all day.For the second time in succession, the night, which is very calm and
magnificently starry, brings a hard frost.In the morning the
Processionaries on the tub, the only ones who have camped unsheltered,
are gathered into a heap which largely overflows both sides of the
fatal ribbon.I am present at the awakening of the numbed ones.The
first to take the road is, as luck will have it, outside the track.Hesitatingly he ventures into unknown ground.He reaches the top of the
rim and descends upon the other side on the earth in the vase.He is
followed by six others, no more.Perhaps the rest of the troop, who
have not fully recovered from their nocturnal torpor, are too lazy to
bestir themselves.The result of this brief delay is a return to the old track.The
caterpillars embark on the silken trail and the circular march is
resumed, this time in the form of a ring with a gap in it.There is no
attempt, however, to strike a new course on the part of the guide whom
this gap has placed at the head.A chance of stepping outside the magic
circle has presented itself at last; and he does not know how to avail
himself of it.As for the caterpillars who have made their way to the inside of the
vase, their lot is hardly improved.They climb to the top of the palm,
starving and seeking for food.Finding nothing to eat that suits them,
they retrace their steps by following the thread which they have left
on the way, climb the ledge of the pot, strike the procession again
and, without further anxiety, slip back into the ranks.Once more the
ring is complete, once more the circle turns and turns.There is a legend that tells of
poor souls dragged along in an endless round until the hellish charm is
broken by a drop of holy water.What drop will good fortune sprinkle on
my Processionaries to dissolve their circle and bring them back to the
nest?I see only two means of conjuring the spell and obtaining a
release from the circuit.A
strange linking of cause and effect: from sorrow and wretchedness good
is to come.And, first, shriveling as the result of cold, the caterpillars gather
together without any order, heap themselves some on the path, some,
more numerous these, outside it.Among the latter there may be, sooner
or later, some revolutionary who, scorning the beaten track, will trace
out a new road and lead the troop back home.We have just seen an
instance of it.Seven penetrated to the interior of the vase and
climbed the palm.True, it was an attempt with no result but still an
attempt.For complete success, all that need be done would have been to
take the opposite <DW72>.In the second place, the exhaustion due to fatigue and hunger.A lame
one stops, unable to go farther.In front of the defaulter the
procession still continues to wend its way for a short time.The ranks
close up and an empty space appears.On coming to himself and resuming
the march, the caterpillar who has caused the breach becomes a leader,
having nothing before him.The least desire for emancipation is all
that he wants to make him launch the band into a new path which perhaps
will be the saving path.In short, when the Processionaries' train is in difficulties, what it
needs, unlike ours, is to run off the rails.The side-tracking is left
to the caprice of a leader who alone is capable of turning to the right
or left; and this leader is absolutely non-existent so long as the ring
remains unbroken.Lastly, the breaking of the circle, the one stroke of
luck, is the result of a chaotic halt, caused principally by excess of
fatigue or cold.The liberating accident, especially that of fatigue, occurs fairly
often.In the course of the same day, the moving circumference is cut
up several times into two or three sections; but continuity soon
returns and no change takes place.The bold
innovator who is to save the situation has not yet had his inspiration.There is nothing new on the fourth day, after an icy night like the
previous one; nothing to tell except the following detail.Yesterday I
did not remove the trace left by the few caterpillars who made their
way to the inside of the vase.This trace, together with a junction
connecting it with the circular road, is discovered in the course of
the morning.Half the troop takes advantage of it to visit the earth in
the pot and climb the palm; the other half remains on the ledge and
continues to walk along the old rail.In the afternoon the band of
emigrants rejoins the others, the circuit is completed and things
return to their original condition.The night frost becomes more intense, without
however as yet reaching the greenhouse.It is followed by bright
sunshine in a calm and limpid sky.As soon as the sun's rays have
warmed the panes a little, the caterpillars, lying in heaps, wake up
and resume their evolutions on the ledge of the vase.This time the
fine order of the beginning is disturbed and a certain disorder becomes
manifest, apparently an omen of deliverance near at hand.The
scouting-path inside the vase, which was upholstered in silk yesterday
and the day before, is to-day followed to its origin on the rim by a
part of the band and is then deserted after a short loop.The other
caterpillars follow the usual ribbon.The result of this bifurcation is
two almost equal files, walking along the ledge in the same direction,
at a short distance from each other, sometimes meeting, separating
farther on, in every case with some lack of order.The crippled, who refuse to go on,
are many.Breaches increase; files are split up into sections each of
which has its leader, who pokes the front of his body this way and that
to explore the ground.Everything seems to point to the disintegration
which will bring safety.Before
the night the single file is reconstituted and the invincible gyration
resumed.Heat comes, just as suddenly as the cold did.To-day, the 4th of
February, is a beautiful, mild day.Numerous festoons of caterpillars, issuing from the nests, meander
along the sand on the shelf.Above them, at every moment, the ring on
the ledge of the vase breaks up and comes together again.For the first
time I see daring leaders who, drunk with heat, standing only on their
hinder prolegs at the extreme edge of the earthenware rim, fling
themselves forward into space, twisting about, sounding the depths.The
endeavour is frequently repeated, while the whole troop stops.The
caterpillars' heads give sudden jerks, their bodies wriggle.One of the pioneers decides to take the plunge.The others, still confiding in the perfidious
silken path, dare not copy him and continue to go along the old road.The short string detached from the general chain gropes about a great
deal, hesitates long on the side of the vase; it goes half-way down,
then climbs up again slantwise, rejoins and takes its place in the
procession.This time the attempt has failed, though at the foot of the
vase, not nine inches away, there lay a bunch of pine-needles which I
had placed there with the object of enticing the hungry ones.Near as they were to the goal, they went up
again.Threads were laid on the way and
will serve as a lure to further enterprise.The road of deliverance has
its first landmarks.And, two days later, on the eighth day of the
experiment, the caterpillars--now singly, anon in small groups, then
again in strings of some length--come down from the ledge by following
the staked-out path.At sunset the last of the laggards is back in the
nest.For seven times twenty-four hours the
caterpillars have remained on the ledge of the vase.To make an ample
allowance for stops due to the weariness of this one or that and above
all for the rest taken during the colder hours of the night, we will
deduct one-half of the time.The average pace is nine centimetres a minute.(3 1/2
inches.--Translator's Note.)The aggregate distance covered, therefore,
is 453 metres, a good deal more than a quarter of a mile, which is a
great walk for these little crawlers.The circumference of the vase,
the perimeter of the track, is exactly 1 metre 35.(4 feet 5
inches.--Translator's Note.)Therefore the circle covered, always in
the same direction and always without result, was described three
hundred and thirty-five times.These figures surprise me, though I am already familiar with the
abysmal stupidity of insects as a class whenever the least accident
occurs.I feel inclined to ask myself whether the Processionaries were
not kept up there so long by the difficulties and dangers of the
descent rather than by the lack of any gleam of intelligence in their
benighted minds.The facts, however, reply that the descent is as easy
as the ascent.The caterpillar has a very supple back, well adapted for twisting round
projections or slipping underneath.He can walk with the same ease
vertically or horizontally, with his back down or up.Besides, he never
moves forward until he has fixed his thread to the ground.With this
support to his feet, he has no falls to fear, no matter what his
position.I had a proof of this before my eyes during a whole week.As I have
already said, the track, instead of keeping on one level, bends twice,
dips at a certain point under the ledge of the vase and reappears at
the top a little farther on.At one part of the circuit, therefore, the
procession walks on the lower surface of the rim; and this inverted
position implies so little discomfort or danger that it is renewed at
each turn for all the caterpillars from first to last.It is out of the question then to suggest the dread of a false step on
the edge of the rim which is so nimbly turned at each point of
inflexion.The caterpillars in distress, starved, shelterless, chilled
with cold at night, cling obstinately to the silk ribbon covered
hundreds of times, because they lack the rudimentary glimmers of reason
which would advise them to abandon it.The ordeal of a
five hundred yards' march and three to four hundred turns teach them
nothing; and it takes casual circumstances to bring them back to the
nest.They would perish on their insidious ribbon if the disorder of
the nocturnal encampments and the halts due to fatigue did not cast a
few threads outside the circular path.Some three or four move along
these trails, laid without an object, stray a little way and, thanks to
their wanderings, prepare the descent, which is at last accomplished in
short strings favoured by chance.The school most highly honoured to-day is very anxious to find the
origin of reason in the dregs of the animal kingdom.Let me call its
attention to the Pine Processionary.THE NARBONNE LYCOSA, OR BLACK-BELLIED TARANTULA.Michelet has told us how, as a printer's apprentice in a cellar, he
established amicable relations with a Spider.(Jules Michelet
(1798-1874), author of "L'Oiseau" and "L'Insecte," in addition to the
historical works for which he is chiefly known.As a lad, he helped his
father, a printer by trade, in setting type.--Translator's Note.)At a
certain hour of the day, a ray of sunlight would glint through the
window of the gloomy workshop and light up the little compositor's
case.Then his eight-legged neighbour would come down from her web and
on the edge of the case take her share of the sunshine.The boy did not
interfere with her; he welcomed the trusting visitor as a friend and as
a pleasant diversion from the long monotony.When we lack the society
of our fellow-men, we take refuge in that of animals, without always
losing by the change.I do not, thank God, suffer from the melancholy of a cellar: my
solitude is gay with light and verdure; I attend, whenever I please,
the fields' high festival, the Thrushes' concert, the Crickets'
symphony; and yet my friendly commerce with the Spider is marked by an
even greater devotion than the young type-setter's.I admit her to the
intimacy of my study, I make room for her among my books, I set her in
the sun on my window-ledge, I visit her assiduously at her home, in the
country.The object of our relations is not to create a means of escape
from the petty worries of life, pin-pricks whereof I have my share like
other men, a very large share, indeed; I propose to submit to the
Spider a host of questions whereto, at times, she condescends to reply.To what fair problems does not the habit of frequenting her give rise!To set them forth worthily, the marvellous art which the little printer
was to acquire were not too much.One needs the pen of a Michelet; and
I have but a rough, blunt pencil.Let us try, nevertheless: even when
poorly clad, truth is still beautiful.The most robust Spider in my district is the Narbonne Lycosa, or
Black-bellied Tarantula, clad in black velvet on the lower surface,
especially under the belly, with brown chevrons on the abdomen and grey
and white rings around the legs.Her favourite home is the dry, pebbly
ground, covered with sun-scorched thyme.In my harmas laboratory there
are quite twenty of this Spider's burrows.Rarely do I pass by one of
these haunts without giving a glance down the pit where gleam, like
diamonds, the four great eyes, the four telescopes, of the hermit.The
four others, which are much smaller, are not visible at that depth.Would I have greater riches, I have but to walk a hundred yards from my
house, on the neighbouring plateau, once a shady forest, to-day a
dreary solitude where the Cricket browses and the Wheat-ear flits from
stone to stone.The love of lucre has laid waste the land.Because wine
paid handsomely, they pulled up the forest to plant the vine.Then came
the Phylloxera, the vine-stocks perished and the once green table-land
is now no more than a desolate stretch where a few tufts of hardy
grasses sprout among the pebbles.This waste-land is the Lycosa's
paradise: in an hour's time, if need were, I should discover a hundred
burrows within a limited range.These dwellings are pits about a foot deep, perpendicular at first and
then bent elbow-wise.On the edge of
the hole stands a kerb, formed of straw, bits and scraps of all sorts
and even small pebbles, the size of a hazel-nut.The whole is kept in
place and cemented with silk.Often, the Spider confines herself to
drawing together the dry blades of the nearest grass, which she ties
down with the straps from her spinnerets, without removing the blades
from the stems; often, also, she rejects this scaffolding in favour of
a masonry constructed of small stones.The nature of the kerb is
decided by the nature of the materials within the Lycosa's reach, in
the close neighbourhood of the building-yard.There is no selection:
everything meets with approval, provided that it be near at hand.The direction is perpendicular, in so far as obstacles, frequent in a
soil of this kind, permit.A bit of gravel can be extracted and hoisted
outside; but a flint is an immovable boulder which the Spider avoids by
giving a bend to her gallery.If more such are met with, the residence
becomes a winding cave, with stone vaults, with lobbies communicating
by means of sharp passages.This lack of plan has no attendant drawbacks, so well does the owner,
from long habit, know every corner and storey of her mansion.If any
interesting buzz occur overhead, the Lycosa climbs up from her rugged
manor with the same speed as from a vertical shaft.Perhaps she even
finds the windings and turnings an advantage, when she has to drag into
her den a prey that happens to defend itself.As a rule, the end of the burrow widens into a side-chamber, a lounge
or resting-place where the Spider meditates at length and is content to
lead a life of quiet when her belly is full.When she reaches maturity and is once settled, the Lycosa becomes
eminently domesticated.I have been living in close communion with her
for the last three years.I have installed her in large earthen pans on
the window-sills of my study and I have her daily under my eyes.Well,
it is very rarely that I happen on her outside, a few inches from her
hole, back to which she bolts at the least alarm.We may take it then that, when not in captivity, the Lycosa does not go
far afield to gather the wherewithal to build her parapet and that she
makes shift with what she finds upon her threshold.In these
conditions, the building-stones are soon exhausted and the masonry
ceases for lack of materials.The wish came over me to see what dimensions the circular edifice would
assume, if the Spider were given an unlimited supply.With captives to
whom I myself act as purveyor the thing is easy enough.Were it only
with a view to helping whoso may one day care to continue these
relations with the big Spider of the waste-lands, let me describe how
my subjects are housed.A good-sized earthenware pan, some nine inches deep, is filled with a
red, clayey earth, rich in pebbles, similar, in short, to that of the
places haunted by the Lycosa.Properly moistened into a paste, the
artificial soil is heaped, layer by layer, around a central reed, of a
bore equal to that of the animal's natural burrow.When the receptacle
is filled to the top, I withdraw the reed, which leaves a yawning,
perpendicular shaft.I thus obtain the abode which shall replace that
of the fields.To find the hermit to inhabit it is merely the matter of a walk in the
neighbourhood.When removed from her own dwelling, which is turned
topsy-turvy by my trowel, and placed in possession of the den produced
by my art, the Lycosa at once disappears into that den.She does not
come out again, seeks nothing better elsewhere.A large wire-gauze
cover rests on the soil in the pan and prevents escape.In any case, the watch, in this respect, makes no demand upon my
diligence.The prisoner is satisfied with her new abode and manifests
no regret for her natural burrow.There is no attempt at flight on her
part.Let me not omit to add that each pan must receive not more than
one inhabitant.To her a neighbour is
fair game, to be eaten without scruple when one has might on one's
side.Time was when, unaware of this fierce intolerance, which is more
savage still at breeding time, I saw hideous orgies perpetrated in my
overstocked cages.I shall have occasion to describe those tragedies
later.Let us meanwhile consider the isolated Lycosae.They do not touch up
the dwelling which I have moulded for them with a bit of reed; at most,
now and again, perhaps with the object of forming a lounge or bedroom
at the bottom, they fling out a few loads of rubbish.But all, little
by little, build the kerb that is to edge the mouth.I have given them plenty of first-rate materials, far superior to those
which they use when left to their own resources.These consist, first,
for the foundations, of little smooth stones, some of which are as
large as an almond.With this road-metal are mingled short strips of
raphia, or palm-fibre, flexible ribbons, easily bent.These stand for
the Spider's usual basket-work, consisting of slender stalks and dry
blades of grass.Lastly, by way of an unprecedented treasure, never yet
employed by a Lycosa, I place at my captives' disposal some thick
threads of wool, cut into inch lengths.As I wish, at the same time, to find out whether my animals, with the
magnificent lenses of their eyes, are able to distinguish colours and
prefer one colour to another, I mix up bits of wool of different hues:
there are red, green, white, and yellow pieces.If the Spider have any
preference, she can choose where she pleases.The Lycosa always works at night, a regrettable circumstance, which
does not allow me to follow the worker's methods.I see the result; and
that is all.Were I to visit the building-yard by the light of a
lantern, I should be no wiser.The Spider, who is very shy, would at
once dive into her lair; and I should have lost my sleep for nothing.Furthermore, she is not a very diligent labourer; she likes to take her
time.Two or three bits of wool or raphia placed in position represent
a whole night's work.And to this slowness we must add long spells of
utter idleness.Two months pass; and the result of my liberality surpasses my
expectations.Possessing more windfalls than they know what to do with,
all picked up in their immediate neighbourhood, my Lycosae have built
themselves donjon-keeps the like of which their race has not yet known.Around the orifice, on a slightly sloping bank, small, flat, smooth
stones have been laid to form a broken, flagged pavement.The larger
stones, which are Cyclopean blocks compared with the size of the animal
that has shifted them, are employed as abundantly as the others.It is an interlacing of raphia and
bits of wool, picked up at random, without distinction of shade.Red
and white, green and yellow are mixed without any attempt at order.The
Lycosa is indifferent to the joys of colour.The ultimate result is a sort of muff, a couple of inches high.Bands
of silk, supplied by the spinnerets, unite the pieces, so that the
whole resembles a coarse fabric.Without being absolutely faultless,
for there are always awkward pieces on the outside, which the worker
could not handle, the gaudy building is not devoid of merit.The bird
lining its nest would do no better.Whoso sees the curious,
many- productions in my pans takes them for an outcome of my
industry, contrived with a view to some experimental mischief; and his
surprise is great when I confess who the real author is.No one would
ever believe the Spider capable of constructing such a monument.It goes without saying that, in a state of liberty, on our barren
waste-lands, the Lycosa does not indulge in such sumptuous
architecture.I have given the reason: she is too great a stay-at-home
to go in search of materials and she makes use of the limited resources
which she finds around her.Bits of earth, small chips of stone, a few
twigs, a few withered grasses: that is all, or nearly all.Wherefore
the work is generally quite modest and reduced to a parapet that hardly
attracts attention.My captives teach us that, when materials are plentiful, especially
textile materials that remove all fears of landslip, the Lycosa
delights in tall turrets.She understands the art of donjon-building
and puts it into practice as often as she possesses the means.An
enthusiastic votary of the chase, so long as she is not permanently
fixed, the Lycosa, once she has set up house, prefers to lie in ambush
and wait for the quarry.Every day, when the heat is greatest, I see my
captives come up slowly from under ground and lean upon the battlements
of their woolly castle-keep.They are then really magnificent in their
stately gravity.With their swelling belly contained within the
aperture, their head outside, their glassy eyes staring, their legs
gathered for a spring, for hours and hours they wait, motionless,
bathing voluptuously in the sun.Should a tit-bit to her liking happen to pass, forthwith the watcher
darts from her tall tower, swift as an arrow from the bow.With a
dagger-thrust in the neck, she stabs the jugular of the Locust,
Dragon-fly or other prey whereof I am the purveyor; and she as quickly
scales the donjon and retires with her capture.The performance is a
wonderful exhibition of skill and speed.Very seldom is a quarry missed, provided that it pass at a convenient
distance, within the range of the huntress' bound.But, if the prey be
at some distance, for instance on the wire of the cage, the Lycosa
takes no notice of it.Scorning to go in pursuit, she allows it to roam
at will.She never strikes except when sure of her stroke.She achieves
this by means of her tower.Hiding behind the wall, she sees the
stranger advancing, keeps her eyes on him and suddenly pounces when he
comes within reach.Though he were winged and swift of flight, the unwary one who
approaches the ambush is lost.This presumes, it is true, an exemplary patience on the Lycosa's part;
for the burrow has naught that can serve to entice victims.At best,
the ledge provided by the turret may, at rare intervals, tempt some
weary wayfarer to use it as a resting-place.But, if the quarry do not
come to-day, it is sure to come to-morrow, the next day, or later, for
the Locusts hop innumerable in the waste-land, nor are they always able
to regulate their leaps.Some day or other, chance is bound to bring
one of them within the purlieus of the burrow.This is the moment to
spring upon the pilgrim from the ramparts.Until then, we maintain a
stoical vigilance.We shall dine when we can; but we shall end by
dining.The Lycosa, therefore, well aware of these lingering eventualities,
waits and is not unduly distressed by a prolonged abstinence.She has
an accommodating stomach, which is satisfied to be gorged to-day and to
remain empty afterwards for goodness knows how long.I have sometimes
neglected my catering duties for weeks at a time; and my boarders have
been none the worse for it.After a more or less protracted fast, they
do not pine away, but are smitten with a wolf-like hunger.All these
ravenous eaters are alike: they guzzle to excess to-day, in
anticipation of to-morrow's dearth.Chance, a poor stand-by, sometimes contrives very well.At the
beginning of the month of August, the children call me to the far side
of the enclosure, rejoicing in a find which they have made under the
rosemary-bushes.It is a magnificent Lycosa, with an enormous belly,
the sign of an impending delivery.Early one morning, ten days later, I find her preparing for her
confinement.A silk network is first spun on the ground, covering an
extent about equal to the palm of one's hand.It is coarse and
shapeless, but firmly fixed.This is the floor on which the Spider
means to operate.On this foundation, which acts as a protection from the sand, the
Lycosa fashions a round mat, the size of a two-franc piece and made of
superb white silk.With a gentle, uniform movement, which might be
regulated by the wheels of a delicate piece of clockwork, the tip of
the abdomen rises and falls, each time touching the supporting base a
little farther away, until the extreme scope of the mechanism is
attained.Then, without the Spider's moving her position, the oscillation is
resumed in the opposite direction.By means of this alternate motion,
interspersed with numerous contacts, a segment of the sheet is
obtained, of a very accurate texture.When this is done, the Spider
moves a little along a circular line and the loom works in the same
manner on another segment.The silk disk, a sort of hardy concave paten, now no longer receives
anything from the spinnerets in its centre; the marginal belt alone
increases in thickness.The piece thus becomes a bowl-shaped porringer,
surrounded by a wide, flat edge.With one quick emission, the viscous,
pale-yellow eggs are laid in the basin, where they heap together in the
shape of a globe which projects largely outside the cavity.The
spinnerets are once more set going.With short movements, as the tip of
the abdomen rises and falls to weave the round mat, they cover up the
exposed hemisphere.The result is a pill set in the middle of a
circular carpet.The legs, hitherto idle, are now working.They take up and break off
one by one the threads that keep the round mat stretched on the coarse
supporting network.At the same time the fangs grip this sheet, lift it
by degrees, tear it from its base and fold it over upon the globe of
eggs.The whole edifice totters, the floor
collapses, fouled with sand.By a movement of the legs, those soiled
shreds are cast aside.Briefly, by means of violent tugs of the fangs,
which pull, and broom-like efforts of the legs, which clear away, the
Lycosa extricates the bag of eggs and removes it as a clear-cut mass,
free from any adhesion.It is a white-silk pill, soft to the touch and glutinous.Its size is
that of an average cherry.An observant eye will notice, running
horizontally around the middle, a fold which a needle is able to raise
without breaking it.This hem, generally undistinguishable from the
rest of the surface, is none other than the edge of the circular mat,
drawn over the lower hemisphere.The other hemisphere, through which
the youngsters will go out, is less well fortified: its only wrapper is
the texture spun over the eggs immediately after they were laid.The work of spinning, followed by that of tearing, is continued for a
whole morning, from five to nine o'clock.Worn out with fatigue, the
mother embraces her dear pill and remains motionless.I shall see no
more to-day.Next morning, I find the Spider carrying the bag of eggs
slung from her stern.Henceforth, until the hatching, she does not leave go of the precious
burden, which, fastened to the spinnerets by a short ligament, drags
and bumps along the ground.With this load banging against her heels,
she goes about her business; she walks or rests, she seeks her prey,
attacks it and devours it.Should some accident cause the wallet to
drop off, it is soon replaced.The spinnerets touch it somewhere,
anywhere, and that is enough: adhesion is at once restored.When the work is done, some of them emancipate themselves, think they
will have a look at the country before retiring for good and all.It is
these whom we meet at times, wandering aimlessly and dragging their bag
behind them.Sooner or later, however, the vagrants return home; and
the month of August is not over before a straw rustled in any burrow
will bring the mother up, with her wallet slung behind her.I am able
to procure as many as I want and, with them, to indulge in certain
experiments of the highest interest.It is a sight worth seeing, that of the Lycosa dragging her treasure
after her, never leaving it, day or night, sleeping or waking, and
defending it with a courage that strikes the beholder with awe.If I
try to take the bag from her, she presses it to her breast in despair,
hangs on to my pincers, bites them with her poison-fangs.I can hear
the daggers grating on the steel.No, she would not allow herself to be
robbed of the wallet with impunity, if my fingers were not supplied
with an implement.By dint of pulling and shaking the pill with the forceps, I take it
from the Lycosa, who protests furiously.I fling her in exchange a pill
taken from another Lycosa.It is at once seized in the fangs, embraced
by the legs and hung on to the spinneret.Her own or another's: it is
all one to the Spider, who walks away proudly with the alien wallet.This was to be expected, in view of the similarity of the pills
exchanged.A test of another kind, with a second subject, renders the mistake more
striking.I substitute, in the place of the lawful bag which I have
removed, the work of the Silky Epeira.The colour and softness of the
material are the same in both cases; but the shape is quite different.The stolen object is a globe; the object presented in exchange is an
elliptical conoid studded with angular projections along the edge of
the base.The Spider takes no account of this dissimilarity.She
promptly glues the queer bag to her spinnerets and is as pleased as
though she were in possession of her real pill.My experimental
villainies have no other consequence beyond an ephemeral carting.When
hatching-time arrives, early in the case of Lycosa, late in that of the
Epeira, the gulled Spider abandons the strange bag and pays it no
further attention.Let us penetrate yet deeper into the wallet-bearer's stupidity.After
depriving the Lycosa of her eggs, I throw her a ball of cork, roughly
polished with a file and of the same size as the stolen pill.She
accepts the corky substance, so different from the silk purse, without
the least demur.One would have thought that she would recognize her
mistake with those eight eyes of hers, which gleam like precious
stones.Lovingly she embraces the
cork ball, fondles it with her palpi, fastens it to her spinnerets and
thenceforth drags it after her as though she were dragging her own bag.Let us give another the choice between the imitation and the real.The
rightful pill and the cork ball are placed together on the floor of the
jar.Will the Spider be able to know the one that belongs to her?The
fool is incapable of doing so.She makes a wild rush and seizes
haphazard at one time her property, at another my sham product.Whatever is first touched becomes a good capture and is forthwith hung
up.If I increase the number of cork balls, if I put in four or five of
them, with the real pill among them, it is seldom that the Lycosa
recovers her own property.Attempts at inquiry, attempts at selection
there are none.Whatever she snaps up at random she sticks to, be it
good or bad.As there are more of the sham pills of cork, these are the
most often seized by the Spider.Can the animal be deceived by the soft
contact of the cork?I replace the cork balls by pellets of cotton or
paper, kept in their round shape with a few bands of thread.Both are
very readily accepted instead of the real bag that has been removed.Can the illusion be due to the colouring, which is light in the cork
and not unlike the tint of the silk globe when soiled with a little
earth, while it is white in the paper and the cotton, when it is
identical with that of the original pill?I give the Lycosa, in
exchange for her work, a pellet of silk thread, chosen of a fine red,
the brightest of all colours.The uncommon pill is as readily accepted
and as jealously guarded as the others.For three weeks and more the Lycosa trails the bag of eggs hanging to
her spinnerets.The reader will remember the experiments described in
the preceding section, particularly those with the cork ball and the
thread pellet which the Spider so foolishly accepts in exchange for the
real pill.Well, this exceedingly dull-witted mother, satisfied with
aught that knocks against her heels, is about to make us wonder at her
devotion.Whether she come up from her shaft to lean upon the kerb and bask in
the sun, whether she suddenly retire underground in the face of danger,
or whether she be roaming the country before settling down, never does
she let go her precious bag, that very cumbrous burden in walking,
climbing or leaping.If, by some accident, it become detached from the
fastening to which it is hung, she flings herself madly on her treasure
and lovingly embraces it, ready to bite whoso would take it from her.I then hear the points of the
poison-fangs grinding against the steel of my pincers, which tug in one
direction while the Lycosa tugs in the other.But let us leave the
animal alone: with a quick touch of the spinnerets, the pill is
restored to its place; and the Spider strides off, still menacing.Towards the end of summer, all the householders, old or young, whether
in captivity on the window-sill or at liberty in the paths of the
enclosure, supply me daily with the following improving sight.In the
morning, as soon as the sun is hot and beats upon their burrow, the
anchorites come up from the bottom with their bag and station
themselves at the opening.Long siestas on the threshold in the sun are
the order of the day throughout the fine season; but, at the present
time, the position adopted is a different one.Formerly, the Lycosa
came out into the sun for her own sake.Leaning on the parapet, she had
the front half of her body outside the pit and the hinder half inside.The eyes took their fill of light; the belly remained in the dark.When
carrying her egg-bag, the Spider reverses the posture: the front is in
the pit, the rear outside.With her hind-legs she holds the white pill
bulging with germs lifted above the entrance; gently she turns and
turns it, so as to present every side to the life-giving rays.And this
goes on for half the day, so long as the temperature is high; and it is
repeated daily, with exquisite patience, during three or four weeks.To
hatch its eggs, the bird covers them with the quilt of its breast; it
strains them to the furnace of its heart.The Lycosa turns hers in
front of the hearth of hearths: she gives them the sun as an incubator.In the early days of September the young ones, who have been some time
hatched, are ready to come out.The whole family emerges from the bag straightway.Then and there, the
youngsters climb to the mother's back.As for the empty bag, now a
worthless shred, it is flung out of the burrow; the Lycosa does not
give it a further thought.Huddled together, sometimes in two or three
layers, according to their number, the little ones cover the whole back
of the mother, who, for seven or eight months to come, will carry her
family night and day.Nowhere can we hope to see a more edifying
domestic picture than that of the Lycosa clothed in her young.From time to time I meet a little band of gipsies passing along the
high-road on their way to some neighbouring fair.The new-born babe
mewls on the mother's breast, in a hammock formed out of a kerchief.The last-weaned is carried pick-a-back; a third toddles clinging to its
mother's skirts; others follow closely, the biggest in the rear,
ferreting in the blackberry-laden hedgerows.It is a magnificent
spectacle of happy-go-lucky fruitfulness.They go their way, penniless
and rejoicing.The sun is hot and the earth is fertile.But how this picture pales before that of the Lycosa, that incomparable
gipsy whose brats are numbered by the hundred!And one and all of them,
from September to April, without a moment's respite, find room upon the
patient creature's back, where they are content to lead a tranquil life
and to be carted about.The little ones are very good; none moves, none seeks a quarrel with
his neighbours.Clinging together, they form a continuous drapery, a
shaggy ulster under which the mother becomes unrecognizable.Is it an
animal, a fluff of wool, a cluster of small seeds fastened to one
another?'Tis impossible to tell at the first glance.The equilibrium of this living blanket is not so firm but that falls
often occur, especially when the mother climbs from indoors and comes
to the threshold to let the little ones take the sun.The least brush
against the gallery unseats a part of the family.The Hen, fidgeting about her Chicks, looks for the strays,
calls them, gathers them together.The Lycosa knows not these maternal
alarms.Impassively, she leaves those who drop off to manage their own
difficulty, which they do with wonderful quickness.Commend me to those
youngsters for getting up without whining, dusting themselves and
resuming their seat in the saddle!The unhorsed ones promptly find a
leg of the mother, the usual climbing-pole; they swarm up it as fast as
they can and recover their places on the bearer's back.The living bark
of animals is reconstructed in the twinkling of an eye.To speak here of mother-love were, I think, extravagant.The Lycosa's
affection for her offspring hardly surpasses that of the plant, which
is unacquainted with any tender feeling and nevertheless bestows the
nicest and most delicate care upon its seeds.The animal, in many
cases, knows no other sense of motherhood.What cares the Lycosa for
her brood!She accepts another's as readily as her own; she is
satisfied so long as her back is burdened with a swarming crowd,
whether it issue from her ovaries or elsewhere.There is no question
here of real maternal affection.I have described elsewhere the prowess of the Copris watching over
cells that are not her handiwork and do not contain her offspring.With
a zeal which even the additional labour laid upon her does not easily
weary, she removes the mildew from the alien dung-balls, which far
exceed the regular nests in number; she gently scrapes and polishes and
repairs them; she listens attentively and enquires by ear into each
nurseling's progress.Her real collection could not receive greater
care.Her own family or another's: it is all one to her.I take a hair-pencil and sweep the
living burden from one of my Spiders, making it fall close to another
covered with her little ones.The evicted youngsters scamper about,
find the new mother's legs outspread, nimbly clamber up these and mount
on the back of the obliging creature, who quietly lets them have their
way.They slip in among the others, or, when the layer is too thick,
push to the front and pass from the abdomen to the thorax and even to
the head, though leaving the region of the eyes uncovered.It does not
do to blind the bearer: the common safety demands that.They know this
and respect the lenses of the eyes, however populous the assembly be.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.The whole animal is now covered with a swarming carpet of young, all
except the legs, which must preserve their freedom of action, and the
under part of the body, where contact with the ground is to be feared.My pencil forces a third family upon the already over-burdened Spider;
and this too is peacefully accepted.The youngsters huddle up closer,
lie one on top of the other in layers and room is found for all.The
Lycosa has lost the last semblance of an animal, has become a nameless
bristling thing that walks about.Falls are frequent and are followed
by continual climbings.I perceive that I have reached the limits, not of the bearer's
good-will, but of equilibrium.The Spider would adopt an indefinite
further number of foundlings, if the dimensions of her back afforded
them a firm hold.Let us restore each
family to its mother, drawing at random from the lot.There must
necessarily be interchanges, but that is of no importance: real
children and adopted children are the same thing in the Lycosa's eyes.One would like to know if, apart from my artifices, in circumstances
where I do not interfere, the good-natured dry-nurse sometimes burdens
herself with a supplementary family; it would also be interesting to
learn what comes of this association of lawful offspring and strangers.I have ample materials wherewith to obtain an answer to both questions.I have housed in the same cage two elderly matrons laden with
youngsters.Each has her home as far removed from the other's as the
size of the common pan permits.Proximity soon kindles fierce jealousies between those
intolerant creatures, who are obliged to live far apart so as to secure
adequate hunting-grounds.One morning I catch the two harridans fighting out their quarrel on the
floor.The loser is laid flat upon her back; the victress, belly to
belly with her adversary, clutches her with her legs and prevents her
from moving a limb.Both have their poison-fangs wide open, ready to
bite without yet daring, so mutually formidable are they.After a
certain period of waiting, during which the pair merely exchange
threats, the stronger of the two, the one on top, closes her lethal
engine and grinds the head of the prostrate foe.Then she calmly
devours the deceased by small mouthfuls.Now what do the youngsters do, while their mother is being eaten?Easily consoled, heedless of the atrocious scene, they climb on the
conqueror's back and quietly take their places among the lawful family.The ogress raises no objection, accepts them as her own.She makes a
meal off the mother and adopts the orphans.Let us add that, for many months yet, until the final emancipation
comes, she will carry them without drawing any distinction between them
and her own young.Henceforth the two families, united in so tragic a
fashion, will form but one.We see how greatly out of place it would be
to speak, in this connection, of mother-love and its fond
manifestations.Does the Lycosa at least feed the younglings who, for seven months,
swarm upon her back?Does she invite them to the banquet when she has
secured a prize?I thought so at first; and, anxious to assist at the
family repast, I devoted special attention to watching the mothers eat.As a rule, the prey is consumed out of sight, in the burrow; but
sometimes also a meal is taken on the threshold, in the open air.Besides, it is easy to rear the Lycosa and her family in a wire-gauze
cage, with a layer of earth wherein the captive will never dream of
sinking a well, such work being out of season.Well, while the mother munches, chews, expresses the juices and
swallows, the youngsters do not budge from their camping-ground on her
back.Not one quits its place nor gives a sign of wishing to slip down
and join in the meal.Nor does the mother extend an invitation to them
to come and recruit themselves, nor put any broken victuals aside for
them.She feeds and the others look on, or rather remain indifferent to
what is happening.Their perfect quiet during the Lycosa's feast points
to the possession of a stomach that knows no cravings.Then with what are they sustained, during their seven months'
upbringing on the mother's back?One conceives a notion of exudations
supplied by the bearer's body, in which case the young would feed on
their mother, after the manner of parasitic vermin, and gradually drain
her strength.Never are they seen to put their mouths to
the skin that should be a sort of teat to them.On the other hand, the
Lycosa, far from being exhausted and shrivelling, keeps perfectly well
and plump.She has the same pot-belly when she finishes rearing her
young as when she began.She has not lost weight: far from it; on the
contrary, she has put on flesh: she has gained the wherewithal to beget
a new family next summer, one as numerous as to-day's.Once more, with what do the little ones keep up their strength?We do
not like to suggest reserves supplied by the egg as rectifying the
animal's expenditure of vital force, especially when we consider that
those reserves, themselves so close to nothing, must be economized in
view of the silk, a material of the highest importance, of which a
plentiful use will be made presently.There must be other powers at
play in the tiny animal's machinery.Total abstinence from food could be understood, if it were accompanied
by inertia: immobility is not life.But the young Lycosae, though
usually quiet on their mother's back, are at all times ready for
exercise and for agile swarming.When they fall from the maternal
perambulator, they briskly pick themselves up, briskly scramble up a
leg and make their way to the top.It is a splendidly nimble and
spirited performance.Besides, once seated, they have to keep a firm
balance in the mass; they have to stretch and stiffen their little
limbs in order to hang on to their neighbours.As a matter of fact,
there is no absolute rest for them.Now physiology teaches us that not
a fibre works without some expenditure of energy.The animal, which can
be likened, in no small measure, to our industrial machines, demands,
on the one hand, the renovation of its organism, which wears out with
movement, and, on the other, the maintenance of the heat transformed
into action.We can compare it with the locomotive-engine.As the iron
horse performs its work, it gradually wears out its pistons, its rods,
its wheels, its boiler-tubes, all of which have to be made good from
time to time.The founder and the smith repair it, supply it, so to
speak, with 'plastic food,' the food that becomes embodied with the
whole and forms part of it.But, though it have just come from the
engine-shop, it is still inert.To acquire the power of movement it
must receive from the stoker a supply of 'energy-producing food'; in
other words, he lights a few shovelfuls of coal in its inside.As nothing is made from nothing, the egg
supplies first the materials of the new-born animal; then the plastic
food, the smith of living creatures, increases the body, up to a
certain limit, and renews it as it wears away.The stoker works at the
same time, without stopping.Fuel, the source of energy, makes but a
short stay in the system, where it is consumed and furnishes heat,
whence movement is derived.Warmed by its food, the
animal machine moves, walks, runs, jumps, swims, flies, sets its
locomotory apparatus going in a thousand manners.To return to the young Lycosae, they grow no larger until the period of
their emancipation.I find them at the age of seven months the same as
when I saw them at their birth.The egg supplied the materials
necessary for their tiny frames; and, as the loss of waste substance
is, for the moment, excessively small, or even nil, additional plastic
food is not needed so long as the wee creature does not grow.In this
respect, the prolonged abstinence presents no difficulty.But there
remains the question of energy-producing food, which is indispensable,
for the little Lycosa moves, when necessary, and very actively at that.To what shall we attribute the heat expended upon action, when the
animal takes absolutely no nourishment?We say to ourselves that, without being life,
a machine is something more than matter, for man has added a little of
his mind to it.Now the iron beast, consuming its ration of coal, is
really browsing the ancient foliage of arborescent ferns in which solar
energy has accumulated.Beasts of flesh and blood act no otherwise.Whether they mutually
devour one another or levy tribute on the plant, they invariably
quicken themselves with the stimulant of the sun's heat, a heat stored
in grass, fruit, seed and those which feed on such.The sun, the soul
of the universe, is the supreme dispenser of energy.Instead of being served up through the intermediary of food and passing
through the ignominious circuit of gastric chemistry, could not this
solar energy penetrate the animal directly and charge it with activity,
even as the battery charges an accumulator with power?Why not live on
sun, seeing that, after all, we find naught but sun in the fruits which
we consume?Chemical science, that bold revolutionary, promises to provide us with
synthetic foodstuffs.The laboratory and the factory will take the
place of the farm.Why should not physical science step in as well?It
would leave the preparation of plastic food to the chemist's retorts;
it would reserve for itself that of energy-producing food which,
reduced to its exact terms, ceases to be matter.With the aid of some
ingenious apparatus, it would pump into us our daily ration of solar
energy, to be later expended in movement, whereby the machine would be
kept going without the often painful assistance of the stomach and its
adjuncts.What a delightful world, where one could lunch off a ray of
sunshine!Is it a dream, or the anticipation of a remote reality?The problem is
one of the most important that science can set us.Let us first hear
the evidence of the young Lycosae regarding its possibilities.For seven months, without any material nourishment, they expend
strength in moving.To wind up the mechanism of their muscles, they
recruit themselves direct with heat and light.During the time when she
was dragging the bag of eggs behind her, the mother, at the best
moments of the day, came and held up her pill to the sun.With her two
hind-legs she lifted it out of the ground into the full light; slowly
she turned it and turned it, so that every side might receive its share
of the vivifying rays.Well, this bath of life, which awakened the
germs, is now prolonged to keep the tender babes active.Daily, if the sky be clear, the Lycosa, carrying her young, comes up
from the burrow, leans on the kerb and spends long hours basking in the
sun.Here, on their mother's back, the youngsters stretch their limbs
delightedly, saturate themselves with heat, take in reserves of
motor-power, absorb energy.They are motionless; but, if I only blow upon them, they stampede as
nimbly as though a hurricane were passing.Hurriedly, they disperse;
hurriedly, they reassemble: a proof that, without material nourishment,
the little animal machine is always at full pressure, ready to work.When the shade comes, mother and sons go down again, surfeited with
solar emanations.The feast of energy at the Sun Tavern is finished for
the day.The fowling-snare is one of man's ingenious villainies.With lines,
pegs and poles, two large, earth- nets are stretched upon the
ground, one to the right, the other to the left of a bare surface.A
long cord, pulled at the right moment by the fowler, who hides in a
brushwood hut, works them and brings them together suddenly, like a
pair of shutters.Divided between the two nets are the cages of the decoy-birds--Linnets
and Chaffinches, Greenfinches and Yellowhammers, Buntings and
Ortolans--sharp-eared creatures which, on perceiving the distant
passage of a flock of their own kind, forthwith utter a short calling
note.One of them, the Sambe, an irresistible tempter, hops about and
flaps his wings in apparent freedom.A bit of twine fastens him to his
convict's stake.When, worn with fatigue and driven desperate by his
vain attempts to get away, the sufferer lies down flat and refuses to
do his duty, the fowler is able to stimulate him without stirring from
his hut.A long string sets in motion a little lever working on a
pivot.Raised from the ground by this diabolical contrivance, the bird
flies, falls down and flies up again at each jerk of the cord.The fowler waits, in the mild sunlight of the autumn morning.The Chaffinches chirp their rallying
cry:

"Pinck!They are
coming, the simpletons; they swoop down upon the treacherous floor.With a rapid movement, the man in ambush pulls his string.The nets
close and the whole flock is caught.Man has wild beast's blood in his veins.The fowler hastens to the
slaughter.With his thumb he stifles the beating of the captives'
hearts, staves in their skulls.The little birds, so many piteous heads
of game, will go to market, strung in dozens on a wire passed through
their nostrils.For scoundrelly ingenuity, the Epeira's net can bear comparison with
the fowler's; it even surpasses it when, on patient study, the main
features of its supreme perfection stand revealed.What refinement of
art for a mess of Flies!Nowhere, in the whole animal kingdom, has the
need to eat inspired a more cunning industry.If the reader will
meditate upon the description that follows, he will certainly share my
admiration.In bearing and colouring, Epeira fasciata is the handsomest of the
Spiders of the South.On her fat belly, a mighty silk-warehouse nearly
as large as a hazel-nut, are alternate yellow, black and silver sashes,
to which she owes her epithet of Banded.Around that portly abdomen the
eight long legs, with their dark- and pale-brown rings, radiate like
spokes.Any small prey suits her; and, as long as she can find supports for her
web, she settles wherever the Locust hops, wherever the Fly hovers,
wherever the Dragon-fly dances or the Butterfly flits.As a rule,
because of the greater abundance of game, she spreads her toils across
some brooklet, from bank to bank among the rushes.She also stretches
them, but not so assiduously, in the thickets of evergreen oak, on the
<DW72>s with the scrubby greenswards, dear to the Grasshoppers.Her hunting-weapon is a large upright web, whose outer boundary, which
varies according to the disposition of the ground, is fastened to the
neighbouring branches by a number of moorings.Let us see, first of
all, how the ropes which form the framework of the building are
obtained.All day invisible, crouching amid the cypress-leaves, the Spider, at
about eight o'clock in the evening, solemnly emerges from her retreat
and makes for the top of a branch.In this exalted position she sits
for sometime laying her plans with due regard to the locality; she
consults the weather, ascertains if the night will be fine.Then,
suddenly, with her eight legs widespread, she lets herself drop
straight down, hanging to the line that issues from her spinnerets.Just as the rope-maker obtains the even output of his hemp by walking
backwards, so does the Epeira obtain the discharge of hers by falling.It is extracted by the weight of her body.The descent, however, has not the brute speed which the force of
gravity would give it, if uncontrolled.It is governed by the action of
the spinnerets, which contract or expand their pores, or close them
entirely, at the faller's pleasure.And so, with gentle moderation, she
pays out this living plumb-line, of which my lantern clearly shows me
the plumb, but not always the line.The great squab seems at such times
to be sprawling in space, without the least support.She comes to an abrupt stop two inches from the ground; the silk-reel
ceases working.The Spider turns round, clutches the line which she has
just obtained and climbs up by this road, still spinning.But, this
time, as she is no longer assisted by the force of gravity, the thread
is extracted in another manner.The two hind-legs, with a quick
alternate action, draw it from the wallet and let it go.On returning to her starting-point, at a height of six feet or more,
the Spider is now in possession of a double line, bent into a loop and
floating loosely in a current of air.She fixes her end where it suits
her and waits until the other end, wafted by the wind, has fastened its
loop to the adjacent twigs.Feeling her thread fixed, the Epeira runs along it repeatedly, from end
to end, adding a fibre to it on each journey.Whether I help or not,
this forms the "suspension cable," the main piece of the framework.I
call it a cable, in spite of its extreme thinness, because of its
structure.It looks as though it were single, but, at the two ends, it
is seen to divide and spread, tuft-wise, into numerous constituent
parts, which are the product of as many crossings.These diverging
fibres, with their several contact-points, increase the steadiness of
the two extremities.The suspension-cable is incomparably stronger than the rest of the work
and lasts for an indefinite time.The web is generally shattered after
the night's hunting and is nearly always rewoven on the following
evening.After the removal of the wreckage, it is made all over again,
on the same site, cleared of everything except the cable from which the
new network is to hang.Once the cable is laid, in this way or in that, the Spider is in
possession of a base that allows her to approach or withdraw from the
leafy piers at will.From the height of the cable she lets herself slip
to a slight depth, varying the points of her fall.In this way she
obtains, to right and left, a few slanting cross-bars, connecting the
cable with the branches.These cross-bars, in their turn, support others in ever changing
directions.When there are enough of them, the Epeira need no longer
resort to falls in order to extract her threads; she goes from one cord
to the next, always wire-drawing with her hind-legs.This results in a
combination of straight lines owning no order, save that they are kept
in one nearly perpendicular plane.Thus is marked out a very irregular
polygonal area, wherein the web, itself a work of magnificent
regularity, shall presently be woven.In the lower part of the web, starting from the centre, a wide opaque
ribbon descends zigzag-wise across the radii.This is the Epeira's
trade-mark, the flourish of an artist initialling his creation."Fecit
So-and-so," she seems to say, when giving the last throw of the shuttle
to her handiwork.That the Spider feels satisfied when, after passing and repassing from
spoke to spoke, she finishes her spiral, is beyond a doubt: the work
achieved ensures her food for a few days to come.But, in this
particular case, the vanity of the spinstress has naught to say to the
matter: the strong silk zigzag is added to impart greater firmness to
the web.The spiral network of the Epeirae possesses contrivances of fearsome
cunning.The thread that forms it is seen with the naked eye to differ
from that of the framework and the spokes.It glitters in the sun,
looks as though it were knotted and gives the impression of a chaplet
of atoms.To examine it through the lens on the web itself is scarcely
feasible, because of the shaking of the fabric, which trembles at the
least breath.By passing a sheet of glass under the web and lifting it,
I take away a few pieces of thread to study, pieces that remain fixed
to the glass in parallel lines.Lens and microscope can now play their
part.Those threads, on the borderland
between the visible and the invisible, are very closely twisted twine,
similar to the gold cord of our officers' sword-knots.The infinitely slender is a tube, a channel full of a
viscous moisture resembling a strong solution of gum arabic.I can see
a diaphanous trail of this moisture trickling through the broken ends.Under the pressure of the thin glass slide that covers them on the
stage of the microscope, the twists lengthen out, become crinkled
ribbons, traversed from end to end, through the middle, by a dark
streak, which is the empty container.The fluid contents must ooze slowly through the side of those tubular
threads, rolled into twisted strings, and thus render the network
sticky.It is sticky, in fact, and in such a way as to provoke
surprise.I bring a fine straw flat down upon three or four rungs of a
sector.However gentle the contact, adhesion is at once established.When I lift the straw, the threads come with it and stretch to twice or
three times their length, like a thread of india-rubber.At last, when
over-taut, they loosen without breaking and resume their original form.They lengthen by unrolling their twist, they shorten by rolling it
again; lastly, they become adhesive by taking the glaze of the gummy
moisture wherewith they are filled.In short, the spiral thread is a capillary tube finer than any that our
physics will ever know.It is rolled into a twist so as to possess an
elasticity that allows it, without breaking, to yield to the tugs of
the captured prey; it holds a supply of sticky matter in reserve in its
tube, so as to renew the adhesive properties of the surface by
incessant exudation, as they become impaired by exposure to the air.The Epeira hunts not with springs, but with lime-snares.Everything is caught in them, down to the dandelion-plume
that barely brushes against them.Nevertheless, the Epeira, who is in
constant touch with her web, is not caught in them.Because the
Spider has contrived for herself, in the middle of her trap, a floor in
whose construction the sticky spiral thread plays no part.There is
here, covering a space which, in the larger webs, is about equal to the
palm of one's hand, a neutral fabric in which the exploring straw finds
no adhesiveness anywhere.Here, on this central resting-floor, and here only, the Epeira takes
her stand, waiting whole days for the arrival of the game.However
close, however prolonged her contact with this portion of the web, she
runs no risk of sticking to it, because the gummy coating is lacking,
as is the twisted and tubular structure, throughout the length of the
spokes and throughout the extent of the auxiliary spiral.These pieces,
together with the rest of the framework, are made of plain, straight,
solid thread.But when a victim is caught, sometimes right at the edge of the web,
the Spider has to rush up quickly, to bind it and overcome its attempts
to free itself.She is walking then upon her network; and I do not find
that she suffers the least inconvenience.The lime-threads are not even
lifted by the movements of her legs.In my boyhood, when a troop of us would go, on Thursdays (The weekly
half-day in French schools.--Translator's Note.), to try and catch a
Goldfinch in the hemp-fields, we used, before covering the twigs with
glue, to grease our fingers with a few drops of oil, lest we should get
them caught in the sticky matter.Does the Epeira know the secret of
fatty substances?I rub my exploring straw with slightly oiled paper.When applied to the
spiral thread of the web, it now no longer sticks to it.I pull out the leg of a live Epeira.Brought just as it
is into contact with the lime-threads, it does not stick to them any
more than to the neutral cords, whether spokes or part of the
framework.We were entitled to expect this, judging by the Spider's
general immunity.But here is something that wholly alters the result.I put the leg to
soak for a quarter of an hour in disulphide of carbon, the best solvent
of fatty matters.I wash it carefully with a brush dipped in the same
fluid.When this washing is finished, the leg sticks to the
snaring-thread quite easily and adheres to it just as well as anything
else would, the unoiled straw, for instance.Did I guess aright when I judged that it was a fatty substance that
preserved the Epeira from the snares of her sticky Catherine-wheel?The
action of the carbon-disulphide seems to say yes.Besides, there is no
reason why a substance of this kind, which plays so frequent a part in
animal economy, should not coat the Spider very slightly by the mere
act of perspiration.We used to rub our fingers with a little oil
before handling the twigs in which the Goldfinch was to be caught; even
so the Epeira varnishes herself with a special sweat, to operate on any
part of her web without fear of the lime-threads.However, an unduly protracted stay on the sticky threads would have its
drawbacks.In the long run, continual contact with those threads might
produce a certain adhesion and inconvenience to the Spider, who must
preserve all her agility in order to rush upon the prey before it can
release itself.For this reason, gummy threads are never used in
building the post of interminable waiting.It is only on her resting-floor that the Epeira sits, motionless and
with her eight legs outspread, ready to mark the least quiver in the
net.It is here, again, that she takes her meals, often long-drawn out,
when the joint is a substantial one; it is hither that, after trussing
and nibbling it, she drags her prey at the end of a thread, to consume
it at her ease on a non-viscous mat.As a hunting-post and refectory,
the Epeira has contrived a central space, free from glue.As for the glue itself, it is hardly possible to study its chemical
properties, because the quantity is so slight.The microscope shows it
trickling from the broken threads in the form of a transparent and more
or less granular streak.The following experiment will tell us more
about it.With a sheet of glass passed across the web, I gather a series of
lime-threads which remain fixed in parallel lines.I cover this sheet
with a bell-jar standing in a depth of water.Soon, in this atmosphere
saturated with humidity, the threads become enveloped in a watery
sheath, which gradually increases and begins to flow.The twisted shape
has by this time disappeared; and the channel of the thread reveals a
chaplet of translucent orbs, that is to say, a series of extremely fine
drops.In twenty-four hours the threads have lost their contents and are
reduced to almost invisible streaks.If I then lay a drop of water on
the glass, I get a sticky solution similar to that which a particle of
gum arabic might yield.The conclusion is evident: the Epeira's glue is
a substance that absorbs moisture freely.In an atmosphere with a high
degree of humidity, it becomes saturated and percolates by sweating
through the side of the tubular threads.These data explain certain facts relating to the work of the net.The
Epeirae weave at very early hours, long before dawn.Should the air
turn misty, they sometimes leave that part of the task unfinished: they
build the general framework, they lay the spokes, they even draw the
auxiliary spiral, for all these parts are unaffected by excess of
moisture; but they are very careful not to work at the lime-threads,
which, if soaked by the fog, would dissolve into sticky shreds and lose
their efficacy by being wetted.The net that was started will be
finished to-morrow, if the atmosphere be favourable.While the highly-absorbent character of the snaring-thread has its
drawbacks, it also has compensating advantages.The Epeirae, when
hunting by day, affect those hot places, exposed to the fierce rays of
the sun, wherein the Crickets delight.In the torrid heats of the
dog-days, therefore, the lime-threads, but for special provisions,
would be liable to dry up, to shrivel into stiff and lifeless
filaments.At the most scorching times
of the day they continue supple, elastic and more and more adhesive.The
moisture of which the air is never deprived penetrates them slowly; it
dilutes the thick contents of their tubes to the requisite degree and
causes it to ooze through, as and when the earlier stickiness
decreases.What bird-catcher could vie with the Garden Spider in the
art of laying lime-snares?And all this industry and cunning for the
capture of a Moth!I should like an anatomist endowed with better implements than mine and
with less tired eyesight to explain to us the work of the marvellous
rope-yard.How is the silken matter moulded into a capillary tube?How
is this tube filled with glue and tightly twisted?And how does this
same mill also turn out plain threads, wrought first into a framework
and then into muslin and satin?What a number of products to come from
that curious factory, a Spider's belly!I behold the results, but fail
to understand the working of the machine.I leave the problem to the
masters of the microtome and the scalpel.The Epeirae are monuments of patience in their lime-snare.With her
head down and her eight legs widespread, the Spider occupies the centre
of the web, the receiving-point of the information sent along the
spokes.If anywhere, behind or before, a vibration occur, the sign of a
capture, the Epeira knows about it, even without the aid of sight.Until then, not a movement: one would think that the animal was
hypnotized by her watching.At most, on the appearance of anything
suspicious, she begins shaking her nest.This is her way of inspiring
the intruder with awe.If I myself wish to provoke the singular alarm,
I have but to tease the Epeira with a bit of straw.You cannot have a
swing without an impulse of some sort.The terror-stricken Spider, who
wishes to strike terror into others, has hit upon something much
better.With nothing to push her, she swings with the floor of ropes.There is no effort, no visible exertion.Not a single part of the
animal moves; and yet everything trembles.When calm is restored, she resumes her attitude, ceaselessly pondering
the harsh problem of life:

"Shall I dine to-day, or not?"Certain privileged beings, exempt from those anxieties, have food in
abundance and need not struggle to obtain it.Such is the Gentle, who
swims blissfully in the broth of the putrefying Adder.Others--and, by
a strange irony of fate, these are generally the most gifted--only
manage to eat by dint of craft and patience.You are of their company, O my industrious Epeirae!So that you may
dine, you spend your treasures of patience nightly; and often without
result.I sympathize with your woes, for I, who am as concerned as you
about my daily bread, I also doggedly spread my net, the net for
catching ideas, a more elusive and less substantial prize than the
Moth.The best part of life is not in the
present, still less in the past; it lies in the future, the domain of
hope.All day long, the sky, of a uniform grey, has appeared to be brewing a
storm.In spite of the threatened downpour, my neighbour, who is a
shrewd weather-prophet, has come out of the cypress-tree and begun to
renew her web at the regular hour.Her forecast is correct: it will be
a fine night.See, the steaming-pan of the clouds splits open; and,
through the apertures, the moon peeps, inquisitively.I too, lantern in
hand, am peeping.A gust of wind from the north clears the realms on
high; the sky becomes magnificent; perfect calm reigns below.The
Spider will dine to-day.What happens next, in an uncertain light, does not lend itself to
accurate observation.It is better to turn to those Garden Spiders who
never leave their web and who hunt mainly in the daytime.The Banded
and the Silky Epeira, both of whom live on the rosemaries in the
enclosure, shall show us in broad daylight the innermost details of the
tragedy.I myself place on the lime-snare a victim of my selecting.Its six legs
are caught without more ado.If the insect raises one of its tarsi and
pulls towards itself, the treacherous thread follows, unwinds slightly
and, without letting go or breaking, yields to the captive's desperate
jerks.Any limb released only tangles the others still more and is
speedily recaptured by the sticky matter.There is no means of escape,
except by smashing the trap with a sudden effort whereof even powerful
insects are not always capable.Warned by the shaking of the net, the Epeira hastens up; she turns
round about the quarry; she inspects it at a distance, so as to
ascertain the extent of the danger before attacking.The strength of
the snareling will decide the plan of campaign.Let us first suppose
the usual case, that of an average head of game, a Moth or Fly of some
sort.Facing her prisoner, the Spider contracts her abdomen slightly
and touches the insect for a moment with the end of her spinnerets;
then, with her front tarsi, she sets her victim spinning.The Squirrel,
in the moving cylinder of his cage, does not display a more graceful or
nimbler dexterity.A cross-bar of the sticky spiral serves as an axis
for the tiny machine, which turns, turns swiftly, like a spit.It is a
treat to the eyes to see it revolve.It is this: the brief
contact of the spinnerets has given a starting-point for a thread,
which the Spider must now draw from her silk warehouse and gradually
roll around the captive, so as to swathe him in a winding-sheet which
will overpower any effort made.It is the exact process employed in our
wire-mills: a motor-driven spool revolves and, by its action, draws the
wire through the narrow eyelet of a steel plate, making it of the
fineness required, and, with the same movement, winds it round and
round its collar.Even so with the Epeira's work.The Spider's front tarsi are the motor;
the revolving spool is the captured insect; the steel eyelet is the
aperture of the spinnerets.To bind the subject with precision and
dispatch nothing could be better than this inexpensive and highly
effective method.With a quick movement,
the Spider herself turns round about the motionless insect, crossing
the web first at the top and then at the bottom and gradually placing
the fastenings of her line.The great elasticity of the lime-threads
allows the Epeira to fling herself time after time right into the web
and to pass through it without damaging the net.Let us now suppose the case of some dangerous game: a Praying Mantis,
for instance, brandishing her lethal limbs, each hooked and fitted with
a double saw; an angry Hornet, darting her awful sting; a sturdy
Beetle, invincible under his horny armour.These are exceptional
morsels, hardly ever known to the Epeirae.Will they be accepted, if
supplied by my stratagems?The game is seen to be perilous of
approach and the Spider turns her back upon it instead of facing it;
she trains her rope-cannon upon it.Quickly the hind-legs draw from the
spinnerets something much better than single cords.The whole
silk-battery works at one and the same time, firing a regular volley of
ribbons and sheets, which a wide movement of the legs spreads fan-wise
and flings over the entangled prisoner.Guarding against sudden starts,
the Epeira casts her armfuls of bands on the front- and hind-parts,
over the legs and over the wings, here, there and everywhere,
extravagantly.The most fiery prey is promptly mastered under this
avalanche.In vain the Mantis tries to open her saw-toothed arm-guards;
in vain the Hornet makes play with her dagger; in vain the Beetle
stiffens his legs and arches his back: a fresh wave of threads swoops
down and paralyses every effort.The ancient retiarius, when pitted against a powerful wild beast,
appeared in the arena with a rope-net folded over his left shoulder.The man, with a sudden movement of his
right arm, cast the net after the manner of the fisherman; he covered
the beast and tangled it in the meshes.A thrust of the trident gave
the quietus to the vanquished foe.The Epeira acts in like fashion, with this advantage, that she is able
to renew her armful of fetters.Should the first not suffice, a second
instantly follows and another and yet another, until the reserves of
silk become exhausted.When all movement ceases under the snowy winding-sheet, the Spider goes
up to her bound prisoner.She has a better weapon than the bestiarius'
trident: she has her poison-fangs.She gnaws at the Locust, without
undue persistence, and then withdraws, leaving the torpid patient to
pine away.These lavished, far-flung ribbons threaten to exhaust the factory; it
would be much more economical to resort to the method of the spool;
but, to turn the machine, the Spider would have to go up to it and work
it with her leg.This is too risky; and hence the continuous spray of
silk, at a safe distance.When all is used up, there is more to come.Still, the Epeira seems concerned at this excessive outlay.When
circumstances permit, she gladly returns to the mechanism of the
revolving spool.I saw her practice this abrupt change of tactics on a
big Beetle, with a smooth, plump body, which lent itself admirably to
the rotary process.After depriving the beast of all power of movement,
she went up to it and turned her corpulent victim as she would have
done with a medium-sized Moth.But with the Praying Mantis, sticking out her long legs and her
spreading wings, rotation is no longer feasible.Then, until the quarry
is thoroughly subdued, the spray of bandages goes on continuously, even
to the point of drying up the silk glands.A capture of this kind is
ruinous.It is true that, except when I interfered, I have never seen
the Spider tackle that formidable provender.Be it feeble or strong, the game is now neatly trussed, by one of the
two methods.The bound insect is bitten,
without persistency and without any wound that shows.The Spider next
retires and allows the bite to act, which it soon does.If the victim be small, a Clothes-moth, for instance, it is consumed on
the spot, at the place where it was captured.But, for a prize of some
importance, on which she hopes to feast for many an hour, sometimes for
many a day, the Spider needs a sequestered dining-room, where there is
naught to fear from the stickiness of the network.Before going to it,
she first makes her prey turn in the converse direction to that of the
original rotation.Her object is to free the nearest spokes, which
supplied pivots for the machinery.They are essential factors which it
behoves her to keep intact, if need be by sacrificing a few cross-bars.It is done; the twisted ends are put back into position.The
well-trussed game is at last removed from the web and fastened on
behind with a thread.The Spider then marches in front and the load is
trundled across the web and hoisted to the resting-floor, which is both
an inspection-post and a dining-hall.When the Spider is of a species
that shuns the light and possesses a telegraph-line, she mounts to her
daytime hiding-place along this line, with the game bumping against her
heels.While she is refreshing herself, let us enquire into the effects of the
little bite previously administered to the silk-swathed captive.Does
the Spider kill the patient with a view to avoiding unseasonable jerks,
protests so disagreeable at dinner-time?In the first place, the attack is so much veiled as to have all the
appearance of a mere kiss.Besides, it is made anywhere, at the first
spot that offers.The expert slayers employ methods of the highest
precision: they give a stab in the neck, or under the throat; they
wound the cervical nerve-centres, the seat of energy.The paralysers,
those accomplished anatomists, poison the motor nerve-centres, of which
they know the number and position.The Epeira possesses none of this
fearsome knowledge.She inserts her fangs at random, as the Bee does
her sting.She does not select one spot rather than another; she bites
indifferently at whatever comes within reach.This being so, her poison
would have to possess unparalleled virulence to produce a corpse-like
inertia no matter which the point attacked.Daniel travelled to the garden.I can scarcely believe in
instantaneous death resulting from the bite, especially in the case of
insects, with their highly-resistant organisms.Besides, is it really a corpse that the Epeira wants, she who feeds on
blood much more than on flesh?It were to her advantage to suck a live
body, wherein the flow of the liquids, set in movement by the pulsation
of the dorsal vessel, that rudimentary heart of insects, must act more
freely than in a lifeless body, with its stagnant fluids.The game
which the Spider means to suck dry might very well not be dead.I place some Locusts of different species on the webs in my menagerie,
one on this, another on that.The Spider comes rushing up, binds the
prey, nibbles at it gently and withdraws, waiting for the bite to take
effect.I then take the insect and carefully strip it of its silken
shroud.The Locust is not dead; far from it; one would even think that
he had suffered no harm.I examine the released prisoner through the
lens in vain; I can see no trace of a wound.Can he be unscathed, in spite of the sort of kiss which I saw given to
him just now?You would be ready to say so, judging by the furious way
in which he kicks in my fingers.Nevertheless, when put on the ground,
he walks awkwardly, he seems reluctant to hop.Perhaps it is a
temporary trouble, caused by his terrible excitement in the web.It
looks as though it would soon pass.I lodge my Locusts in cages, with a lettuce-leaf to console them for
their trials; but they will not be comforted.A day elapses, followed
by a second.Not one of them touches the leaf of salad; their appetite
has disappeared.Their movements become more uncertain, as though
hampered by irresistible torpor.On the second day they are dead,
everyone irrecoverably dead.The Epeira, therefore, does not incontinently kill her prey with her
delicate bite; she poisons it so as to produce a gradual weakness,
which gives the blood-sucker ample time to drain her victim, without
the least risk, before the rigor mortis stops the flow of moisture.The meal lasts quite twenty-four hours, if the joint be large; and to
the very end the butchered insect retains a remnant of life, a
favourable condition for the exhausting of the juices.Once again, we
see a skilful method of slaughter, very different from the tactics in
use among the expert paralysers or slayers.Here there is no display of
anatomical science.Unacquainted with the patient's structure, the
Spider stabs at random.The virulence of the poison does the rest.There are, however, some very few cases in which the bite is speedily
mortal.My notes speak of an Angular Epeira grappling with the largest
Dragon-fly in my district (Aeshna grandis, Lin.)I myself had entangled
in the web this head of big game, which is not often captured by the
Epeirae.The net shakes violently, seems bound to break its moorings.The Spider rushes from her leafy villa, runs boldly up to the giantess,
flings a single bundle of ropes at her and, without further
precautions, grips her with her legs, tries to subdue her and then digs
her fangs into the Dragon-fly's back.The bite is prolonged in such a
way as to astonish me.This is not the perfunctory kiss with which I am
already familiar; it is a deep, determined wound.After striking her
blow, the Spider retires to a certain distance and waits for her poison
to take effect.Laid upon my table and left alone for twenty-four hours, she makes not
the slightest movement.A prick of which my lens cannot see the marks,
so sharp-pointed are the Epeira's weapons, was enough, with a little
insistence, to kill the powerful animal.Proportionately, the
Rattlesnake, the Horned Viper, the Trigonocephalus and other ill-famed
serpents produce less paralysing effects upon their victims.And these Epeirae, so terrible to insects, I am able to handle without
any fear.If I persuaded them to bite me,
what would happen to me?We have more cause to dread
the sting of a nettle than the dagger which is fatal to Dragon-flies.The same virus acts differently upon this organism and that, is
formidable here and quite mild there.What kills the insect may easily
be harmless to us.Let us not, however, generalize too far.The
Narbonne Lycosa, that other enthusiastic insect-huntress, would make us
pay dearly if we attempted to take liberties with her.It is not uninteresting to watch the Epeira at dinner.I light upon
one, the Banded Epeira, at the moment, about three o'clock in the
afternoon, when she has captured a Locust.Planted in the centre of the
web, on her resting-floor, she attacks the venison at the joint of a
haunch.There is no movement, not even of the mouth-parts, so far as I
am able to discover.The mouth lingers, close-applied, at the point
originally bitten.There are no intermittent mouthfuls, with the
mandibles moving backwards and forwards.I
visit her for the last time at nine o'clock in the evening.Matters
stand exactly as they did: after six hours' consumption, the mouth is
still sucking at the lower end of the right haunch.The fluid contents
of the victim are transferred to the ogress's belly, I know not how.Next morning, the Spider is still at table.Naught remains of the Locust but his skin, hardly altered in shape, but
utterly drained and perforated in several places.The method,
therefore, was changed during the night.To extract the non-fluent
residue, the viscera and muscles, the stiff cuticle had to be tapped
here, there and elsewhere, after which the tattered husk, placed bodily
in the press of the mandibles, would have been chewed, re-chewed and
finally reduced to a pill, which the sated Spider throws up.This would
have been the end of the victim, had I not taken it away before the
time.Whether she wound or kill, the Epeira bites her captive somewhere or
other, no matter where.This is an excellent method on her part,
because of the variety of the game that comes her way.I see her
accepting with equal readiness whatever chance may send her:
Butterflies and Dragon-flies, Flies and Wasps, small Dung-beetles and
Locusts.If I offer her a Mantis, a Bumble-bee, an Anoxia--the
equivalent of the common Cockchafer--and other dishes probably unknown
to her race, she accepts all and any, large and small, thin-skinned and
horny-skinned, that which goes afoot and that which takes winged
flight.She is omnivorous, she preys on everything, down to her own
kind, should the occasion offer.Had she to operate according to individual structure, she would need an
anatomical dictionary; and instinct is essentially unfamiliar with
generalities: its knowledge is always confined to limited points.The
Cerceres know their Weevils and their Buprestis-beetles absolutely; the
Sphex their Grasshoppers, their Crickets and their Locusts; the Scoliae
their Cetonia- and Oryctes-grubs.(The Scolia is a Digger-wasp, like
the Cerceris and the Sphex, and feeds her larvae on the grubs of the
Cetonia, or Rose-chafer, and the Oryctes, or
Rhinoceros-beetle.--Translator's Note.)Each has her own victim and knows nothing of any of the others.The same exclusive tastes prevail among the slayers.Let us remember,
in this connection, Philanthus apivorus and, especially, the Thomisus,
the comely Spider who cuts Bees' throats.They understand the fatal
blow, either in the neck or under the chin, a thing which the Epeira
does not understand; but, just because of this talent, they are
specialists.Animals are a little like ourselves: they excel in an art only on
condition of specializing in it.Sandra went to the bedroom.The Epeira, who, being omnivorous, is
obliged to generalize, abandons scientific methods and makes up for
this by distilling a poison capable of producing torpor and even death,
no matter what the point attacked.Recognizing the large variety of game, we wonder how the Epeira manages
not to hesitate amid those many diverse forms, how, for instance, she
passes from the Locust to the Butterfly, so different in appearance.To
attribute to her as a guide an extensive zoological knowledge were
wildly in excess of what we may reasonably expect of her poor
intelligence.The thing moves, therefore it is worth catching: this
formula seems to sum up the Spider's wisdom.Of the six Garden Spiders that form the object of my observations, two
only, the Banded and the Silky Epeira, remain constantly in their webs,
even under the blinding rays of a fierce sun.The others, as a rule, do
not show themselves until nightfall.At some distance from the net they
have a rough-and-ready retreat in the brambles, an ambush made of a few
leaves held together by stretched threads.It is here that, for the
most part, they remain in the daytime, motionless and sunk in
meditation.But the shrill light that vexes them is the joy of the fields.At such
times the Locust hops more nimbly than ever, more gaily skims the
Dragon-fly.Besides, the limy web, despite the rents suffered during
the night, is still in serviceable condition.If some giddy-pate allow
himself to be caught, will the Spider, at the distance whereto she has
retired, be unable to take advantage of the windfall?The alarm is given by the vibration of the web, much more than by the
sight of the captured object.I lay upon a Banded Epeira's lime-threads a Locust that second
asphyxiated with carbon disulphide.The carcass is placed in front, or
behind, or at either side of the Spider, who sits moveless in the
centre of the net.If the test is to be applied to a species with a
daytime hiding-place amid the foliage, the dead Locust is laid on the
web, more or less near the centre, no matter how.The Epeira remains in her
motionless attitude, even when the morsel is at a short distance in
front of her.She is indifferent to the presence of the game, does not
seem to perceive it, so much so that she ends by wearing out my
patience.Then, with a long straw, which enables me to conceal myself
slightly, I set the dead insect trembling.The Banded Epeira and the Silky Epeira hasten to
the central floor; the others come down from the branch; all go to the
Locust, swathe him with tape, treat him, in short, as they would treat
a live prey captured under normal conditions.It took the shaking of
the web to decide them to attack.Perhaps the grey colour of the Locust is not sufficiently conspicuous
to attract attention by itself.Then let us try red, the brightest
colour to our retina and probably also to the Spiders'.None of the
game hunted by the Epeirae being clad in scarlet, I make a small bundle
out of red wool, a bait of the size of a Locust.As long as the parcel is stationary, the Spider
is not roused; but, the moment it trembles, stirred by my straw, she
runs up eagerly.There are silly ones who just touch the thing with their legs and,
without further enquiries, swathe it in silk after the manner of the
usual game.They even go so far as to dig their fangs into the bait,
following the rule of the preliminary poisoning.Then and then only the
mistake is recognized and the tricked Spider retires and does not come
back, unless it be long afterwards, when she flings the lumbersome
object out of the web.Like the others, these hasten to the
red-woollen lure, which my straw insidiously keeps moving; they come
from their tent among the leaves as readily as from the centre of the
web; they explore it with their palpi and their legs; but, soon
perceiving that the thing is valueless, they are careful not to spend
their silk on useless bonds.Still, the clever ones, like the silly ones, run even from a distance,
from their leafy ambush.Before recognizing their mistake, they have to hold the object between
their legs and even to nibble at it a little.At a hand's-breadth's distance, the lifeless prey,
unable to shake the web, remains unperceived.Besides, in many cases,
the hunting takes place in the dense darkness of the night, when sight,
even if it were good, would not avail.If the eyes are insufficient guides, even close at hand, how will it be
when the prey has to be spied from afar?In that case, an intelligence
apparatus for long-distance work becomes indispensable.We have no
difficulty in detecting the apparatus.Let us look attentively behind the web of any Epeira with a daytime
hiding-place: we shall see a thread that starts from the centre of the
network, ascends in a slanting line outside the plane of the web and
ends at the ambush where the Spider lurks all day.Except at the
central point, there is no connection between this thread and the rest
of the work, no interweaving with the scaffolding-threads.Free of
impediment, the line runs straight from the centre of the net to the
ambush-tent.The Angular Epeira,
settled high up in the trees, has shown me some as long as eight or
nine feet.There is no doubt that this slanting line is a foot-bridge which allows
the Spider to repair hurriedly to the web, when summoned by urgent
business, and then, when her round is finished, to return to her hut.In fact, it is the road which I see her follow, in going and coming.No; for, if the Epeira had no aim in view but a means
of rapid transit between her tent and the net, the foot-bridge would be
fastened to the upper edge of the web.The journey would be shorter and
the <DW72> less steep.Why, moreover, does this line always start in the centre of the sticky
network and nowhere else?Because that is the point where the spokes
meet and, therefore, the common centre of vibration.Anything that
moves upon the web sets it shaking.All then that is needed is a thread
issuing from this central point to convey to a distance the news of a
prey struggling in some part or other of the net.The slanting cord,
extending outside the plane of the web, is more than a foot-bridge: it
is, above all, a signalling-apparatus, a telegraph-wire.Caught in the
sticky toils, he plunges about.Forthwith, the Spider issues
impetuously from her hut, comes down the foot-bridge, makes a rush for
the Locust, wraps him up and operates on him according to rule.Soon
after, she hoists him, fastened by a line to her spinneret, and drags
him to her hiding-place, where a long banquet will be held.So far,
nothing new: things happen as usual.I leave the Spider to mind her own affairs for some days before I
interfere with her.I again propose to give her a Locust; but this time
I first cut the signalling-thread with a touch of the scissors, without
shaking any part of the edifice.Complete success: the entangled insect struggles, sets the net
quivering; the Spider, on her side, does not stir, as though heedless
of events.The idea might occur to one that, in this business, the Epeira stays
motionless in her cabin since she is prevented from hurrying down,
because the foot-bridge is broken.Let us undeceive ourselves: for one
road open to her there are a hundred, all ready to bring her to the
place where her presence is now required.The network is fastened to
the branches by a host of lines, all of them very easy to cross.Well,
the Epeira embarks upon none of them, but remains moveless and
self-absorbed.Because her telegraph, being out of order, no longer tells her of
the shaking of the web.The captured prey is too far off for her to see
it; she is all unwitting.A good hour passes, with the Locust still
kicking, the Spider impassive, myself watching.Nevertheless, in the
end, the Epeira wakes up: no longer feeling the signalling-thread,
broken by my scissors, as taut as usual under her legs, she comes to
look into the state of things.The web is reached, without the least
difficulty, by one of the lines of the framework, the first that
offers.The Locust is then perceived and forthwith enswathed, after
which the signalling-thread is remade, taking the place of the one
which I have broken.Along this road the Spider goes home, dragging her
prey behind her.My neighbour, the mighty Angular Epeira, with her telegraph-wire nine
feet long, has even better things in store for me.One morning I find
her web, which is now deserted, almost intact, a proof that the night's
hunting has not been good.With a piece of
game for a bait, I hope to bring her down from her lofty retreat.I entangle in the web a rare morsel, a Dragon-fly, who struggles
desperately and sets the whole net a-shaking.The other, up above,
leaves her lurking-place amid the cypress-foliage, strides swiftly down
along her telegraph-wire, comes to the Dragon-fly, trusses her and at
once climbs home again by the same road, with her prize dangling at her
heels by a thread.The final sacrifice will take place in the quiet of
the leafy sanctuary.A few days later I renew my experiment under the same conditions, but,
this time, I first cut the signalling-thread.In vain I select a large
Dragon-fly, a very restless prisoner; in vain I exert my patience: the
Spider does not come down all day.Her telegraph being broken, she
receives no notice of what is happening nine feet below.The entangled
morsel remains where it lies, not despised, but unknown.At nightfall
the Epeira leaves her cabin, passes over the ruins of her web, finds
the Dragon-fly and eats him on the spot, after which the net is
renewed.The Epeirae, who occupy a distant retreat by day, cannot do without a
private wire that keeps them in permanent communication with the
deserted web.All of them have one, in point of fact, but only when age
comes, age prone to rest and to long slumbers.In their youth, the
Epeirae, who are then very wide awake, know nothing of the art of
telegraphy.Besides, their web, a short-lived work whereof hardly a
trace remains on the morrow, does not allow of this kind of industry.It is no use going to the expense of a signalling-apparatus for a
ruined snare wherein nothing can now be caught.Only the old Spiders,
meditating or dozing in their green tent, are warned from afar, by
telegraph, of what takes place on the web.To save herself from keeping a close watch that would degenerate into
drudgery and to remain alive to events even when resting, with her back
turned on the net, the ambushed Spider always has her foot upon the
telegraph-wire.Of my observations on this subject, let me relate the
following, which will be sufficient for our purpose.An Angular Epeira, with a remarkably fine belly, has spun her web
between two laurustine-shrubs, covering a width of nearly a yard.The
sun beats upon the snare, which is abandoned long before dawn.The
Spider is in her day manor, a resort easily discovered by following the
telegraph-wire.It is a vaulted chamber of dead leaves, joined together
with a few bits of silk.The refuge is deep: the Spider disappears in
it entirely, all but her rounded hind-quarters, which bar the entrance
to her donjon.With her front half plunged into the back of her hut, the Epeira
certainly cannot see her web.Even if she had good sight, instead of
being purblind, her position could not possibly allow her to keep the
prey in view.Does she give up hunting during this period of bright
sunlight?One of her hind-legs is stretched outside the leafy cabin;
and the signalling-thread ends just at the tip of that leg.Whoso has
not seen the Epeira in this attitude, with her hand, so to speak, on
the telegraph-receiver, knows nothing of one of the most curious
instances of animal cleverness.Let any game appear upon the scene; and
the slumberer, forthwith aroused by means of the leg receiving the
vibrations, hastens up.A Locust whom I myself lay on the web procures
her this agreeable shock and what follows.If she is satisfied with her
bag, I am still more satisfied with what I have learnt.The different parts
of the framework, tossed and teased by the eddying air-currents, cannot
fail to transmit their vibration to the signalling-thread.Nevertheless, the Spider does not quit her hut and remains indifferent
to the commotion prevailing in the net.Her line, therefore, is
something better than a bell-rope that pulls and communicates the
impulse given: it is a telephone capable, like our own, of transmitting
infinitesimal waves of sound.Clutching her telephone-wire with a toe,
the Spider listens with her leg; she perceives the innermost
vibrations; she distinguishes between the vibration proceeding from a
prisoner and the mere shaking caused by the wind.A wasp-like garb of motley black and yellow; a slender and graceful
figure; wings not spread out flat, when resting, but folded lengthwise
in two; the abdomen a sort of chemist's retort, which swells into a
gourd and is fastened to the thorax by a long neck, first distending
into a pear, then shrinking to a thread; a leisurely and silent flight;
lonely habits.There we have a summary sketch of the Eumenes.My part
of the country possesses two species: the larger, Eumenes Amedei, Lep.,
measures nearly an inch in length; the other, Eumenes pomiformis,
Fabr., is a reduction of the first to the scale of one-half.(I include
three species promiscuously under this one name, that is to say,
Eumenes pomiformis, Fabr., E. bipunctis, Sauss., and E. dubius, Sauss.As I did not distinguish between them in my first investigations, which
date a very long time back, it is not possible for me to ascribe to
each of them its respective nest.But their habits are the same, for
which reason this confusion does not injuriously affect the order of
ideas in the present chapter.--Author's Note.)Similar in form and colouring, both possess a like talent for
architecture; and this talent is expressed in a work of the highest
perfection which charms the most untutored eye.The Eumenes follow the profession of arms, which is
unfavourable to artistic effort; they stab a prey with their sting;
they pillage and plunder.They are predatory Hymenoptera, victualling
their grubs with caterpillars.It will be interesting to compare their
habits with those of the operator on the Grey Worm.(Ammophila hirsuta,
who hunts the Grey Worm, the caterpillar of Noctua segetum, the Dart or
Turnip Moth.--Translator's Note.)Though the quarry--caterpillars in
either case--remain the same, perhaps instinct, which is liable to vary
with the species, has fresh glimpses in store for us.Besides, the
edifice built by the Eumenes in itself deserves inspection.The Hunting Wasps whose story we have described in former volumes are
wonderfully well versed in the art of wielding the lancet; they astound
us with their surgical methods, which they seem to have learnt from
some physiologist who allows nothing to escape him; but those skilful
slayers have no merit as builders of dwelling-houses.What is their
home, in point of fact?An underground passage, with a cell at the end
of it; a gallery, an excavation, a shapeless cave.It is miner's work,
navvy's work: vigorous sometimes, artistic never.They use the pick-axe
for loosening, the crowbar for shifting, the rake for extracting the
materials, but never the trowel for laying.Now in the Eumenes we see
real masons, who build their houses bit by bit with stone and mortar
and run them up in the open, either on the firm rock or on the shaky
support of a bough.Hunting alternates with architecture; the insect is
a Nimrod or a Vitruvius by turns.(Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman
architect and engineer.--Translator's Note.)And, first of all, what sites do these builders select for their homes?Should you pass some little garden-wall, facing south, in a
sun-scorched corner, look at the stones that are not covered with
plaster, look at them one by one, especially the largest; examine the
masses of boulders, at no great height from the ground, where the
fierce rays have heated them to the temperature of a Turkish bath; and,
perhaps, if you seek long enough, you will light upon the structure of
Eumenes Amedei.The insect is scarce and lives apart; a meeting is an
event upon which we must not count with too great confidence.It is an
African species and loves the heat that ripens the carob and the date.It haunts the sunniest spots and selects rocks or firm stones as a
foundation for its nest.Sometimes also, but seldom, it copies the
Chalicodoma of the Walls and builds upon an ordinary pebble.(Or
Mason-bee.--Translator's Note.)Eumenes pomiformis is much more common and is comparatively indifferent
to the nature of the foundation whereon she erects her cells.She
builds on walls, on isolated stones, on the wood of the inner surface
of half-closed shutters; or else she adopts an aerial base, the slender
twig of a shrub, the withered sprig of a plant of some sort.Less
chilly than her African cousin, she does not shun the unprotected
spaces exposed to every wind that blows.When erected on a horizontal surface, where nothing interferes with it,
the structure of Eumenes Amedei is a symmetrical cupola, a spherical
skull-cap, with, at the top, a narrow passage just wide enough for the
insect, and surmounted by a neatly funnelled neck.It suggests the
round hut of the Eskimo or of the ancient Gael, with its central
chimney.Two centimetres and a half (.97 inch.--Translator's Note.),
more or less, represent the diameter, and two centimetres the height.(.78 inch.--Translator's Note.)When the support is a perpendicular
plane, the building still retains the domed shape, but the entrance-
and exit-funnel opens at the side, upwards.The floor of this apartment
calls for no labour: it is supplied direct by the bare stone.Having chosen the site, the builder erects a circular fence about three
millimetres thick.(.118 inch.--Translator's Note.)The materials
consist of mortar and small stones.The insect selects its stone-quarry
in some well-trodden path, on some neighbouring road, at the driest,
hardest spots.With its mandibles, it scrapes together a small quantity
of dust and saturates it with saliva until the whole becomes a regular
hydraulic mortar which soon sets and is no longer susceptible to water.The Mason-bees have shown us a similar exploitation of the beaten paths
and of the road-mender's macadam.All these open-air builders, all
these erectors of monuments exposed to wind and weather require an
exceedingly dry stone-dust; otherwise the material, already moistened
with water, would not properly absorb the liquid that is to give it
cohesion; and the edifice would soon be wrecked by the rains.They
possess the sense of discrimination of the plasterer, who rejects
plaster injured by damp.We shall see presently how the insects that
build under shelter avoid this laborious macadam-scraping and give the
preference to fresh earth already reduced to a paste by its own
dampness.When common lime answers our purpose, we do not trouble about
Roman cement.Now Eumenes Amedei requires a first-class cement, even
better than that of the Chalicodoma of the Walls, for the work, when
finished, does not receive the thick covering wherewith the Mason-bee
protects her cluster of cells.And therefore the cupola-builder, as
often as she can, uses the highway as her stone-pit.These are bits of gravel of an
almost unvarying size--that of a peppercorn--but of a shape and kind
differing greatly, according to the places worked.Some are
sharp-cornered, with facets determined by chance fractures; some are
round, polished by friction under water.Some are of limestone, others
of silicic matter.The favourite stones, when the neighbourhood of the
nest permits, are little nodules of quartz, smooth and semitransparent.The insect weighs them, so to say,
measures them with the compass of its mandibles and does not accept
them until after recognizing in them the requisite qualities of size
and hardness.A circular fence, we were saying, is begun on the bare rock.Before the
mortar sets, which does not take long, the mason sticks a few stones
into the soft mass, as the work advances.She dabs them half-way into
the cement, so as to leave them jutting out to a large extent, without
penetrating to the inside, where the wall must remain smooth for the
sake of the larva's comfort.If necessary, a little plaster is added,
to tone down the inner protuberances.The solidly embedded stonework
alternates with the pure mortarwork, of which each fresh course
receives its facing of tiny encrusted pebbles.As the edifice is
raised, the builder <DW72>s the construction a little towards the centre
and fashions the curve which will give the spherical shape.We employ
arched centrings to support the masonry of a dome while building: the
Eumenes, more daring than we, erects her cupola without any
scaffolding.A round orifice is contrived at the summit; and, on this orifice, rises
a funnelled mouthpiece built of pure cement.It might be the graceful
neck of some Etruscan vase.When the cell is victualled and the egg
laid, this mouthpiece is closed with a cement plug; and in this plug is
set a little pebble, one alone, no more: the ritual never varies.This
work of rustic architecture has naught to fear from the inclemency of
the weather; it does not yield to the pressure of the fingers; it
resists the knife that attempts to remove it without breaking it.Its
nipple shape and the bits of gravel wherewith it bristles all over the
outside remind one of certain cromlechs of olden time, of certain
tumuli whose domes are strewn with Cyclopean stones.Such is the appearance of the edifice when the cell stands alone; but
the Hymenopteron nearly always fixes other domes against her first, to
the number of five, six, or more.This shortens the labour by allowing
her to use the same partition for two adjoining rooms.The original
elegant symmetry is lost and the whole now forms a cluster which, at
first sight, appears to be merely a clod of dry mud, sprinkled with
tiny pebbles.But let us examine the shapeless mass more closely and we
shall perceive the number of chambers composing the habitation with the
funnelled mouths, each quite distinct and each furnished with its
gravel stopper set in the cement.The Chalicodoma of the Walls employs the same building methods as
Eumenes Amedei: in the courses of cement she fixes, on the outside,
small stones of minor bulk.Her work begins by being a turret of rustic
art, not without a certain prettiness; then, when the cells are placed
side by side, the whole construction degenerates into a lump governed
apparently by no architectural rule.Moreover, the Mason-bee covers her
mass of cells with a thick layer of cement, which conceals the original
rockwork edifice.The Eumenes does not resort to this general coating:
her building is too strong to need it; she leaves the pebbly facings
uncovered, as well as the entrances to the cells.The two sorts of
nests, although constructed of similar materials, are therefore easily
distinguished.The Eumenes' cupola is the work of an artist; and the artist would be
sorry to cover his masterpiece with whitewash.I crave forgiveness for
a suggestion which I advance with all the reserve befitting so delicate
a subject.Would it not be possible for the cromlech-builder to take a
pride in her work, to look upon it with some affection and to feel
gratified by this evidence of her cleverness?Might there not be an
insect science of aesthetics?I seem at least to catch a glimpse, in
the Eumenes, of a propensity to beautify her work.The nest must be,
before all, a solid habitation, an inviolable stronghold; but, should
ornament intervene without jeopardizing the power of resistance, will
the worker remain indifferent to it?The orifice at the top, if left as a mere
hole, would suit the purpose quite as well as an elaborate door: the
insect would lose nothing in regard to facilities for coming and going
and would gain by shortening the labour.Yet we find, on the contrary,
the mouth of an amphora, gracefully curved, worthy of a potter's wheel.A choice cement and careful work are necessary for the confection of
its slender, funnelled shaft.Why this nice finish, if the builder be
wholly absorbed in the solidity of her work?Here is another detail: among the bits of gravel employed for the outer
covering of the cupola, grains of quartz predominate.They are polished
and translucent; they glitter slightly and please the eye.Why are
these little pebbles preferred to chips of lime-stone, when both
materials are found in equal abundance around the nest?A yet more remarkable feature: we find pretty often, encrusted on the
dome, a few tiny, empty snail-shells, bleached by the sun.The species
usually selected by the Eumenes is one of the smaller Helices--Helix
strigata--frequent on our parched <DW72>s.I have seen nests where this
Helix took the place of pebbles almost entirely.They were like boxes
made of shells, the work of a patient hand.Certain Australian birds, notably the
Bower-birds, build themselves covered walks, or playhouses, with
interwoven twigs, and decorate the two entrances to the portico by
strewing the threshold with anything that they can find in the shape of
glittering, polished, or bright- objects.Every door-sill is a
cabinet of curiosities where the collector gathers smooth pebbles,
variegated shells, empty snail-shells, parrot's feathers, bones that
have come to look like sticks of ivory.The odds and ends mislaid by
man find a home in the bird's museum, where we see pipe-stems, metal
buttons, strips of cotton stuff and stone axe-heads.The collection at either entrance to the bower is large enough to fill
half a bushel.As these objects are of no use to the bird, its only
motive for accumulating them must be an art-lover's hobby.Our common
Magpie has similar tastes: any shiny thing that he comes upon he picks
up, hides and hoards.Well, the Eumenes, who shares this passion for bright pebbles and empty
snail-shells, is the Bower-bird of the insect world; but she is a more
practical collector, knows how to combine the useful and the ornamental
and employs her finds in the construction of her nest, which is both a
fortress and a museum.When she finds nodules of translucent quartz,
she rejects everything else: the building will be all the prettier for
them.When she comes across a little white shell, she hastens to
beautify her dome with it; should fortune smile and empty snail-shells
abound, she encrusts the whole fabric with them, until it becomes the
supreme expression of her artistic taste.The nest of Eumenes pomiformis is the size of an average cherry and
constructed of pure mortar, without the least outward pebblework.Its
shape is exactly similar to that which we have just described.When
built upon a horizontal base of sufficient extent, it is a dome with a
central neck, funnelled like the mouth of an urn.But when the
foundation is reduced to a mere point, as on the twig of a shrub, the
nest becomes a spherical capsule, always, of course, surmounted by a
neck.It is then a miniature specimen of exotic pottery, a paunchy
alcarraza.Its thickens is very slight, less than that of a sheet of
paper; it crushes under the least effort of the fingers.It displays wrinkles and seams, due to the different
courses of mortar, or else knotty protuberances distributed almost
concentrically.Both Hymenoptera accumulate caterpillars in their coffers, whether
domes or jars.Let us give an abstract of the bill of fare.These
documents, for all their dryness, possess a value; they will enable
whoso cares to interest himself in the Eumenes to perceive to what
extent instinct varies the diet, according to the place and season.The
food is plentiful, but lacks variety.It consists of tiny caterpillars,
by which I mean the grubs of small Butterflies.We learn this from the
structure, for we observe in the prey selected by either Hymenopteran
the usual caterpillar organism.The body is composed of twelve
segments, not including the head.The first three have true legs, the
next two are legless, then come two segments with prolegs, two legless
segments and, lastly, a terminal segment with prolegs.It is exactly
the same structure which we saw in the Ammophila's Grey Worm.My old notes give the following description of the caterpillars found
in the nest of Eumenes Amedei: "a pale green or, less often, a
yellowish body, covered with short white hairs; head wider than the
front segment, dead-black and also bristling with hairs.Length: 16 to
18 millimetres (.63 to.7 inch.--Translator's Note.); width: about 3
millimetres."(.12 inch.--Translator's Note.)A quarter of a century
and more has elapsed since I jotted down this descriptive sketch; and
to-day, at Serignan, I find in the Eumenes' larder the same game which
I noticed long ago at Carpentras.Time and distance have not altered
the nature of the provisions.The number of morsels served for the meal of each larva interests us
more than the quality.In the cells of Eumenes Amedei, I find sometimes
five caterpillars and sometimes ten, which means a difference of a
hundred per cent in the quantity of the food, for the morsels are of
exactly the same size in both cases.Why this unequal supply, which
gives a double portion to one larva and a single portion to another?The diners have the same appetite: what one nurseling demands a second
must demand, unless we have here a different menu, according to the
sexes.In the perfect stage the males are smaller than the females, are
hardly half as much in weight or volume.The amount of victuals,
therefore, required to bring them to their final development may be
reduced by one-half.In that case, the well-stocked cells belong to
females; the others, more meagrely supplied, belong to males.But the egg is laid when the provisions are stored; and this egg has a
determined sex, though the most minute examination is not able to
discover the differences which will decide the hatching of a female or
a male.We are therefore needs driven to this strange conclusion: the
mother knows beforehand the sex of the egg which she is about to lay;
and this knowledge allows her to fill the larder according to the
appetite of the future grub.What a strange world, so wholly different
from ours!We fall back upon a special sense to explain the Ammophila's
hunting; what can we fall back upon to account for this intuition of
the future?Can the theory of chances play a part in the hazy problem?If nothing is logically arranged with a foreseen object, how is this
clear vision of the invisible acquired?The capsules of Eumenes pomiformis are literally crammed with game.It
is true that the morsels are very small.My notes speak of fourteen
green caterpillars in one cell and sixteen in a second cell.I have no
other information about the integral diet of this Wasp, whom I have
neglected somewhat, preferring to study her cousin, the builder of
rockwork domes.As the two sexes differ in size, although to a lesser
degree than in the case of Eumenes Amedei, I am inclined to think that
those two well-filled cells belonged to females and that the males'
cells must have a less sumptuous table.Not having seen for myself, I
am content to set down this mere suspicion.What I have seen and often seen is the pebbly nest, with the larva
inside and the provisions partly consumed.To continue the rearing at
home and follow my charge's progress from day to day was a business
which I could not resist; besides, as far as I was able to see, it was
easily managed.I had had some practice in this foster-father's trade;
my association with the Bembex, the Ammophila, the Sphex (three species
of Digger-wasps.--Translator's Note.)and many others had turned me
into a passable insect-rearer.I was no novice in the art of dividing
an old pen-box into compartments in which I laid a bed of sand and, on
this bed, the larva and her provisions delicately removed from the
maternal cell.Success was almost certain at each attempt: I used to
watch the larvae at their meals, I saw my nurselings grow up and spin
their cocoons.Relying upon the experience thus gained, I reckoned upon
success in raising my Eumenes.The results, however, in no way answered to my expectations.All my
endeavours failed; and the larva allowed itself to die a piteous death
without touching its provisions.I ascribed my reverse to this, that and the other cause: perhaps I had
injured the frail grub when demolishing the fortress; a splinter of
masonry had bruised it when I forced open the hard dome with my knife;
a too sudden exposure to the sun had surprised it when I withdrew it
from the darkness of its cell; the open air might have dried up its
moisture.I did the best I could to remedy all these probable reasons
of failure.I went to work with every possible caution in breaking open
the home; I cast the shadow of my body over the nest, to save the grub
from sunstroke; I at once transferred larva and provisions into a glass
tube and placed this tube in a box which I carried in my hand, to
minimize the jolting on the journey.Nothing was of avail: the larva,
when taken from its dwelling, always allowed itself to pine away.For a long time I persisted in explaining my want of success by the
difficulties attending the removal.Eumenes Amedei's cell is a strong
casket which cannot be forced without sustaining a shock; and the
demolition of a work of this kind entails such varied accidents that we
are always liable to think that the worm has been bruised by the
wreckage.As for carrying home the nest intact on its support, with a
view to opening it with greater care than is permitted by a
rough-and-ready operation in the fields, that is out of the question:
the nest nearly always stands on an immovable rock or on some big stone
forming part of a wall.If I failed in my attempts at rearing, it was
because the larva had suffered when I was breaking up her house.The
reason seemed a good one; and I let it go at that.In the end, another idea occurred to me and made me doubt whether my
rebuffs were always due to clumsy accidents.The Eumenes' cells are
crammed with game: there are ten caterpillars in the cell of Eumenes
Amedei and fifteen in that of Eumenes pomiformis.These caterpillars,
stabbed no doubt, but in a manner unknown to me, are not entirely
motionless.The mandibles seize upon what is presented to them, the
body buckles and unbuckles, the hinder half lashes out briskly when
stirred with the point of a needle.At what spot is the egg laid amid
that swarming mass, where thirty mandibles can make a hole in it, where
a hundred and twenty pairs of legs can tear it?When the victuals
consist of a single head of game, these perils do not exist; and the
egg is laid on the victim not at hazard, but upon a judiciously chosen
spot.Thus, for instance, Ammophila hirsuta fixes hers, by one end,
cross-wise, on the Grey Worm, on the side of the first prolegged
segment.The eggs hang over the caterpillar's back, away from the legs,
whose proximity might be dangerous.The worm, moreover, stung in the
greater number of its nerve-centres, lies on one side, motionless and
incapable of bodily contortions or said an jerks of its hinder
segments.If the mandibles try to snap, if the legs give a kick or two,
they find nothing in front of them: the Ammophila's egg is at the
opposite side.The tiny grub is thus able, as soon as it hatches, to
dig into the giant's belly in full security.How different are the conditions in the Eumenes' cell.The caterpillars
are imperfectly paralysed, perhaps because they have received but a
single stab; they toss about when touched with a pin; they are bound to
wriggle when bitten by the larva.If the egg is laid on one of them,
the first morsel will, I admit, be consumed without danger, on
condition that the point of attack be wisely chosen; but there remain
others which are not deprived of every means of defence.Let a movement
take place in the mass; and the egg, shifted from the upper layer, will
tumble into a pitfall of legs and mandibles.The least thing is enough
to jeopardize its existence; and this least thing has every chance of
being brought about in the disordered heap of caterpillars.The egg, a
tiny cylinder, transparent as crystal, is extremely delicate: a touch
withers it, the least pressure crushes it.No, its place is not in the mass of provisions, for the caterpillars, I
repeat, are not sufficiently harmless.Their paralysis is incomplete,
as is proved by their contortions when I irritate them and shown, on
the other hand, by a very important fact.I have sometimes taken from
Eumenes Amedei's cell a few heads of game half transformed into
chrysalids.It is evident that the transformation was effected in the
cell itself and, therefore, after the operation which the Wasp had
performed upon them.I cannot say
precisely, never having seen the huntress at work.The sting most
certainly has played its part; but where?What we are able to declare is that the torpor is not
very deep, inasmuch as the patient sometimes retains enough vitality to
shed its skin and become a chrysalid.Everything thus tends to make us
ask by what stratagem the egg is shielded from danger.This stratagem I longed to discover; I would not be put off by the
scarcity of nests, by the irksomeness of the searches, by the risk of
sunstroke, by the time taken up, by the vain breaking open of
unsuitable cells; I meant to see and I saw.Here is my method: with the
point of a knife and a pair of nippers, I make a side opening, a
window, beneath the dome of Eumenes Amedei and Eumenes pomiformis.I
work with the greatest care, so as not to injure the recluse.Formerly
I attacked the cupola from the top, now I attack it from the side.I
stop when the breach is large enough to allow me to see the state of
things within.I pause to give the reader time to
reflect and to think out for himself a means of safety that will
protect the egg and afterwards the grub in the perilous conditions
which I have set forth.Seek, think and contrive, such of you as have
inventive minds.The egg is not laid upon the provisions; it is hung from the top of the
cupola by a thread which vies with that of a Spider's web for
slenderness.The dainty cylinder quivers and swings to and fro at the
least breath; it reminds me of the famous pendulum suspended from the
dome of the Pantheon to prove the rotation of the earth.The victuals
are heaped up underneath.In order to witness it, we must
open a window in cell upon cell until fortune deigns to smile upon us.The larva is hatched and already fairly large.Like the egg, it hangs
perpendicularly, by the rear, from the ceiling; but the suspensory cord
has gained considerably in length and consists of the original thread
eked out by a sort of ribbon.The grub is at dinner: head downwards, it
is digging into the limp belly of one of the caterpillars.I touch up
the game that is still intact with a straw.The grub forthwith retires from the fray.Marvel is
added to marvels: what I took for a flat cord, for a ribbon, at the
lower end of the suspensory thread, is a sheath, a scabbard, a sort of
ascending gallery wherein the larva crawls backwards and makes its way
up.The cast shell of the egg, retaining its cylindrical form and
perhaps lengthened by a special operation on the part of the new-born
grub, forms this safety-channel.At the least sign of danger in the
heap of caterpillars, the larva retreats into its sheath and climbs
back to the ceiling, where the swarming rabble cannot reach it.When
peace is restored, it slides down its case and returns to table, with
its head over the viands and its rear upturned and ready to withdraw in
case of need.Strength has come; the larva is brawny enough not
to dread the movements of the caterpillars' bodies.Besides, the
caterpillars, mortified by fasting and weakened by a prolonged torpor,
become more and more incapable of defence.The perils of the tender
babe are succeeded by the security of the lusty stripling; and the
grub, henceforth scorning its sheathed lift, lets itself drop upon the
game that remains.That is what I saw in the nests of both species of the Eumenes and that
is what I showed to friends who were even more surprised than I by
these ingenious tactics.The egg hanging from the ceiling, at a
distance from the provisions, has naught to fear from the caterpillars,
which flounder about below.The new-hatched larva, whose suspensory
cord is lengthened by the sheath of the egg, reaches the game and takes
a first cautious bite at it.If there be danger, it climbs back to the
ceiling by retreating inside the scabbard.This explains the failure of
my earlier attempts.Not knowing of the safety-thread, so slender and
so easily broken, I gathered at one time the egg, at another the young
larva, after my inroads at the top had caused them to fall into the
middle of the live victuals.Neither of them was able to thrive when
brought into direct contact with the dangerous game.If any one of my readers, to whom I appealed just now, has thought out
something better than the Eumenes' invention, I beg that he will let me
know: there is a curious parallel to be drawn between the inspirations
of reason and the inspirations of instinct.February has its sunny days, heralding spring, to which rude winter
will reluctantly yield place.In snug corners, among the rocks, the
great spurge of our district, the characias of the Greeks, the jusclo
of the Provencals, begins to lift its drooping inflorescence and
discreetly opens a few sombre flowers.Here the first midges of the
year will come to slake their thirst.By the time that the tip of the
stalks reaches the perpendicular, the worst of the cold weather will be
over.Another eager one, the almond-tree, risking the loss of its fruit,
hastens to echo these preludes to the festival of the sun, preludes
which are too often treacherous.A few days of soft skies and it
becomes a glorious dome of white flowers, each twinkling with a roseate
eye.The country, which still lacks green, seems dotted everywhere with
white-satin pavilions.'Twould be a callous heart indeed that could
resist the magic of this awakening.The insect nation is represented at these rites by a few of its more
zealous members.There is first of all the Honey-bee, the sworn enemy
of strikes, who profits by the least lull of winter to find out if some
rosemary or other is not beginning to open somewhere near the hive.The
droning of the busy swarms fills the flowery vault, while a snow of
petals falls softly to the foot of the tree.Together with the population of harvesters there mingles another, less
numerous, of mere drinkers, whose nesting-time has not yet begun.This
is the colony of the Osmiae, those exceedingly pretty solitary bees,
with their copper-<DW52> skin and bright-red fleece.Two species have
come hurrying up to take part in the joys of the almond-tree: first,
the Horned Osmia, clad in black velvet on the head and breast, with red
velvet on the abdomen; and, a little later, the Three-horned Osmia,
whose livery must be red and red only.These are the first delegates
despatched by the pollen-gleaners to ascertain the state of the season
and attend the festival of the early blooms.'Tis but a moment since they burst their cocoon, the winter abode: they
have left their retreats in the crevices of the old walls; should the
north wind blow and set the almond-tree shivering, they will hasten to
return to them.Hail to you, O my dear Osmiae, who yearly, from the far
end of the harmas, opposite snow-capped Ventoux (A mountain in the
Provencal Alps, near Carpentras and Serignan 6,271 feet.--Translator's
Note.), bring me the first tidings of the awakening of the insect
world!I am one of your friends; let us talk about you a little.Most of the Osmiae of my region do not themselves prepare the dwelling
destined for the laying.They want ready-made lodgings, such as the old
cells and old galleries of Anthophorae and Chalicodomae.If these
favourite haunts are lacking, then a hiding-place in the wall, a round
hole in some bit of wood, the tube of a reed, the spiral of a dead
Snail under a heap of stones are adopted, according to the tastes of
the several species.The retreat selected is divided into chambers by
partition-walls, after which the entrance to the dwelling receives a
massive seal.That is the sum-total of the building done.For this plasterer's rather than mason's work, the Horned and the
Three-horned Osmia employ soft earth.This material is a sort of dried
mud, which turns to pap on the addition of a drop of water.The two
Osmiae limit themselves to gathering natural soaked earth, mud in
short, which they allow to dry without any special preparation on their
part; and so they need deep and well-sheltered retreats, into which the
rain cannot penetrate, or the work would fall to pieces.Latreille's Osmia uses different materials for her partitions and her
doors.She chews the leaves of some mucilaginous plant, some mallow
perhaps, and then prepares a sort of green putty with which she builds
her partitions and finally closes the entrance to the dwelling.When
she settles in the spacious cells of the Masked Anthophora (Anthophora
personata, Illig.), the entrance to the gallery, which is wide enough
to admit a man's finger, is closed with a voluminous plug of this
vegetable paste.On the earthy banks, hardened by the sun, the home is
then betrayed by the gaudy colour of the lid.It is as though the
authorities had closed the door and affixed to it their great seals of
green wax.So far then as their building-materials are concerned, the Osmiae whom
I have been able to observe are divided into two classes: one building
compartments with mud, the other with a green-tinted vegetable putty.To the latter belongs Latreille's Osmia.The first section includes the
Horned Osmia and the Three-horned Osmia, both so remarkable for the
horny tubercles on their faces.The great reed of the south, Arundo donax, is often used, in the
country, for making rough garden-shelters against the mistral or just
for fences.These reeds, the ends of which are chopped off to make them
all the same length, are planted perpendicularly in the earth.I have
often explored them in the hope of finding Osmia-nests.The partitions
and the closing-plug of the Horned and of the Three-horned Osmia are
made, as we have seen, of a sort of mud which water instantly reduces
to pap.With the upright position of the reeds, the stopper of the
opening would receive the rain and would become diluted; the ceilings
of the storeys would fall in and the family would perish by drowning.Therefore the Osmia, who knew of these drawbacks before I did, refuses
the reeds when they are placed perpendicularly.The same reed is used for a second purpose.We make canisses of it,
that is to say, hurdles, which, in spring, serve for the rearing of
Silkworms and, in autumn, for the drying of figs.At the end of April
and during May, which is the time when the Osmiae work, the canisses
are indoors, in the Silkworm nurseries, where the Bee cannot take
possession of them; in autumn, they are outside, exposing their layers
of figs and peeled peaches to the sun; but by that time the Osmiae have
long disappeared.If, however, during the spring, an old, disused
hurdle is left out of doors, in a horizontal position, the Three-horned
Osmia often takes possession of it and makes use of the two ends, where
the reeds lie truncated and open.There are other quarters that suit the Three-horned Osmia, who is not
particular, it seems to me, and will make shift with any hiding-place,
so long as it have the requisite conditions of diameter, solidity,
sanitation and kindly darkness.The most original dwellings that I know
her to occupy are disused Snail-shells, especially the house of the
Common Snail (Helix aspersa).Let us go to the <DW72> of the hills thick
with olive-trees and inspect the little supporting-walls which are
built of dry stones and face the south.In the crevices of this
insecure masonry we shall reap a harvest of old Snail-shells, plugged
with earth right up to the orifice.The family of the Three-horned
Osmia is settled in the spiral of those shells, which is subdivided
into chambers by mud partitions.The Three-pronged Osmia (O. Tridentata, Duf.alone creates a
home of her own, digging herself a channel with her mandibles in dry
bramble and sometimes in danewort.She wants a dark retreat, hidden from the eye.I would like, nevertheless, to watch her in the privacy of her home and
to witness her work with the same facility as if she were nest-building
in the open air.Perhaps there are some interesting characteristics to
be picked up in the depths of her retreats.It remains to be seen
whether my wish can be realized.When studying the insect's mental capacity, especially its very
retentive memory for places, I was led to ask myself whether it would
not be possible to make a suitably-chosen Bee build in any place that I
wished, even in my study.And I wanted, for an experiment of this sort,
not an individual but a numerous colony.My preference lent towards the
Three-horned Osmia, who is very plentiful in my neighbourhood, where,
together with Latreille's Osmia, she frequents in particular the
monstrous nests of the Chalicodoma of the Sheds.I therefore thought
out a scheme for making the Three-horned Osmia accept my study as her
settlement and build her nest in glass tubes, through which I could
easily watch the progress.To these crystal galleries, which might well
inspire a certain distrust, were to be added more natural retreats:
reeds of every length and thickness and disused Chalicodoma-nests taken
from among the biggest and the smallest.I admit it, while mentioning that perhaps none ever succeeded so well
with me.All I ask is that the birth of my
insects, that is to say, their first seeing the light, their emerging
from the cocoon, should take place on the spot where I propose to make
them settle.Here there must be retreats of no matter what nature, but
of a shape similar to that in which the Osmia delights.The first
impressions of sight, which are the most long-lived of any, shall bring
back my insects to the place of their birth.And not only will the
Osmiae return, through the always open windows, but they will also
nidify on the natal spot, if they find something like the necessary
conditions.And so, all through the winter, I collect Osmia-cocoons picked up in
the nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds; I go to Carpentras to glean a
more plentiful supply in the nests of the Anthophora.I spread out my
stock in a large open box on a table which receives a bright diffused
light but not the direct rays of the sun.The table stands between two
windows facing south and overlooking the garden.When the moment of
hatching comes, those two windows will always remain open to give the
swarm entire liberty to go in and out as it pleases.The glass tubes
and reed-stumps are laid here and there, in fine disorder, close to the
heaps of cocoons and all in a horizontal position, for the Osmia will
have nothing to do with upright reeds.Although such a precaution is
not indispensable, I take care to place some cocoons in each cylinder.The hatching of some of the Osmiae will therefore take place under
cover of the galleries destined to be the building-yard later; and the
site will be all the more deeply impressed on their memory.When I have
made these comprehensive arrangements, there is nothing more to be
done; and I wait patiently for the building-season to open.My Osmiae leave their cocoons in the second half of April.Under the
immediate rays of the sun, in well-sheltered nooks, the hatching would
occur a month earlier, as we can see from the mixed population of the
snowy almond-tree.The constant shade in my study has delayed the
awakening, without, however, making any change in the nesting-period,
which synchronizes with the flowering of the thyme.We now have, around
my working-table, my books, my jars and my various appliances, a
buzzing crowd that goes in and out of the windows at every moment.I
enjoin the household henceforth not to touch a thing in the insects'
laboratory, to do no more sweeping, no more dusting.They might disturb
a swarm and make it think that my hospitality was not to be trusted.During four or five weeks I witness the work of a number of Osmiae
which is much too large to allow my watching their individual
operations.I content myself with a few, whom I mark with
different- spots to distinguish them; and I take no notice of
the others, whose finished work will have my attention later.If the sun is bright, they flutter
around the heap of tubes as if to take careful note of the locality;
blows are exchanged and the rival swains indulge in mild skirmishing on
the floor, then shake the dust off their wings.They fly assiduously
from tube to tube, placing their heads in the orifices to see if some
female will at last make up her mind to emerge.She is covered with dust and has the
disordered toilet that is inseparable from the hard work of the
deliverance.A lover has seen her, so has a second, likewise a third.The lady responds to their advances by clashing
her mandibles, which open and shut rapidly, several times in
succession.The suitors forthwith fall back; and they also, no doubt to
keep up their dignity, execute savage mandibular grimaces.Then the
beauty retires into the arbour and her wooers resume their places on
the threshold.A fresh appearance of the female, who repeats the play
with her jaws; a fresh retreat of the males, who do the best they can
to flourish their own pincers.The Osmiae have a strange way of
declaring their passion: with that fearsome gnashing of their
mandibles, the lovers look as though they meant to devour each other.It suggests the thumps affected by our yokels in their moments of
gallantry.The females, who grow more numerous
from day to day, inspect the premises; they buzz outside the glass
galleries and the reed dwellings; they go in, stay for a while, come
out, go in again and then fly away briskly into the garden.They
return, first one, then another.They halt outside, in the sun, or on
the shutters fastened back against the wall; they hover in the
window-recess, come inside, go to the reeds and give a glance at them,
only to set off again and to return soon after.Thus do they learn to
know their home, thus do they fix their birthplace in their memory.The
village of our childhood is always a cherished spot, never to be
effaced from our recollection.The Osmia's life endures for a month;
and she acquires a lasting remembrance of her hamlet in a couple of
days.'Twas there that she was born; 'twas there that she loved; 'tis
there that she will return.Dulces reminiscitur Argos.(Now falling by another's wound, his eyes
  He casts to heaven, on Argos thinks and dies.--"Aeneid" Book 10, Dryden's translation.)The work of construction begins; and
my expectations are fulfilled far beyond my wishes.The Osmiae build
nests in all the retreats which I have placed at their disposal.And
now, O my Osmiae, I leave you a free field!The work begins with a thorough spring-cleaning of the home.Remnants
of cocoons, dirt consisting of spoilt honey, bits of plaster from
broken partitions, remains of dried Mollusc at the bottom of a shell:
these and much other insanitary refuse must first of all disappear.Violently the Osmia tugs at the offending object and tears it out; and
then off she goes in a desperate hurry, to dispose of it far away from
the study.They are all alike, these ardent sweepers: in their
excessive zeal, they fear lest they should block up the speck of dust
which they might drop in front of the new house.The glass tubes, which
I myself have rinsed under the tap, are not exempt from a scrupulous
cleaning.The Osmia dusts them, brushes them thoroughly with her tarsi
and then sweeps them out backwards.It makes no difference: as a conscientious housewife, she gives the
place a touch of the broom nevertheless.Now for the provisions and the partition-walls.Here the order of the
work changes according to the diameter of the cylinder.My glass tubes
vary greatly in dimensions.The largest have an inner width of a dozen
millimetres (Nearly half an inch.--Translator's Note.); the narrowest
measure six or seven.(About a quarter of an inch.--Translator's Note.)In the latter, if the bottom suit her, the Osmia sets to work bringing
pollen and honey.If the bottom do not suit her, if the sorghum-pith
plug with which I have closed the rear-end of the tube be too irregular
and badly-joined, the Bee coats it with a little mortar.When this
small repair is made, the harvesting begins.In the wider tubes, the work proceeds quite differently.At the moment
when the Osmia disgorges her honey and especially at the moment when,
with her hind-tarsi, she rubs the pollen-dust from her ventral brush,
she needs a narrow aperture, just big enough to allow of her passage.I
imagine that in a straitened gallery the rubbing of her whole body
against the sides gives the harvester a support for her brushing-work.In a spacious cylinder this support fails her; and the Osmia starts
with creating one for herself, which she does by narrowing the channel.Whether it be to facilitate the storing of the victuals or for any
other reason, the fact remains that the Osmia housed in a wide tube
begins with the partitioning.Her division is made by a dab of clay placed at right angles to the
axis of the cylinder, at a distance from the bottom determined by the
ordinary length of a cell.The wad is not a complete round; it is more
crescent-shaped, leaving a circular space between it and one side of
the tube.Fresh layers are swiftly added to the dab of clay; and soon
the tube is divided by a partition which has a circular opening at the
side of it, a sort of dog-hole through which the Osmia will proceed to
knead the Bee-bread.When the victualling is finished and the egg laid
upon the heap, the whole is closed and the filled-up partition becomes
the bottom of the next cell.Then the same method is repeated, that is
to say, in front of the just completed ceiling a second partition is
built, again with a side-passage, which is stouter, owing to its
distance from the centre, and better able to withstand the numerous
comings and goings of the housewife than a central orifice, deprived of
the direct support of the wall, could hope to be.When this partition
is ready, the provisioning of the second cell is effected; and so on
until the wide cylinder is completely stocked.The building of this preliminary party-wall, with a narrow, round
dog-hole, for a chamber to which the victuals will not be brought until
later is not restricted to the Three-horned Osmia; it is also
frequently found in the case of the Horned Osmia and of Latreille's
Osmia.Nothing could be prettier than the work of the last-named, who
goes to the plants for her material and fashions a delicate sheet in
which she cuts a graceful arch.The Chinaman partitions his house with
paper screens; Latreille's Osmia divides hers with disks of thin green
cardboard perforated with a serving-hatch which remains until the room
is completely furnished.When we have no glass houses at our disposal,
we can see these little architectural refinements in the reeds of the
hurdles, if we open them at the right season.By splitting the bramble-stumps in the course of July, we perceive also
that the Three-pronged Osmia notwithstanding her narrow gallery,
follows the same practice as Latreille's Osmia, with a difference.She
does not build a party-wall, which the diameter of the cylinder would
not permit; she confines herself to putting up a frail circular pad of
green putty, as though to limit, before any attempt at harvesting, the
space to be occupied by the Bee-bread, whose depth could not be
calculated afterwards if the insect did not first mark out its
confines.If, in order to see the Osmia's nest as a whole, we split a reed
lengthwise, taking care not to disturb its contents; or, better still,
if we select for examination the string of cells built in a glass tube,
we are forthwith struck by one detail, namely, the uneven distances
between the partitions, which are placed almost at right angles to the
axis of the cylinder.It is these distances which fix the size of the
chambers, which, with a similar base, have different heights and
consequently unequal holding-capacities.The bottom partitions, the
oldest, are farther apart; those of the front part, near the orifice,
are closer together.Moreover, the provisions are plentiful in the
loftier cells, whereas they are niggardly and reduced to one-half or
even one-third in the cells of lesser height.Let me say at once that
the large cells are destined for the females and the small ones for the
males.DISTRIBUTION OF THE SEXES.Does the insect which stores up provisions proportionate to the needs
of the egg which it is about to lay know beforehand the sex of that
egg?What we have to do is to
turn this suspicion into a certainty demonstrated by experiment.And
first let us find out how the sexes are arranged.It is not possible to ascertain the chronological order of a laying,
except by going to suitably-chosen species.Fortunately there are a few
species in which we do not find this difficulty: these are the Bees who
keep to one gallery and build their cells in storeys.Among the number
are the different inhabitants of the bramble-stumps, notably the
Three-pronged Osmiae, who form an excellent subject for observation,
partly because they are of imposing size--bigger than any other
bramble-dwellers in my neighbourhood--partly because they are so
plentiful.Let us briefly recall the Osmia's habits.Amid the tangle of a hedge, a
bramble-stalk is selected, still standing, but a mere withered stump.In this the insect digs a more or less deep tunnel, an easy piece of
work owing to the abundance of soft pith.Provisions are heaped up
right at the bottom of the tunnel and an egg is laid on the surface of
the food: that is the first-born of the family.At a height of some
twelve millimetres (About half an inch.--Translator's Note.This gives a second storey, which in its turn
receives provisions and an egg, the second in order of primogeniture.And so it goes on, storey by storey, until the cylinder is full.Then
the thick plug of the same green material of which the partitions are
formed closes the home and keeps out marauders.In this common cradle, the chronological order of births is perfectly
clear.The first-born of the family is at the bottom of the series; the
last-born is at the top, near the closed door.The others follow from
bottom to top in the same order in which they followed in point of
time.The laying is numbered automatically; each cocoon tells us its
respective age by the place which it occupies.A number of eggs bordering on fifteen represents the entire family of
an Osmia, and my observations enable me to state that the distribution
of the sexes is not governed by any rule.All that I can say in general
is that the complete series begins with females and nearly always ends
with males.The incomplete series--those which the insect has laid in
various places--can teach us nothing in this respect, for they are only
fragments starting we know not whence; and it is impossible to tell
whether they should be ascribed to the beginning, to the end, or to an
intermediate period of the laying.To sum up: in the laying of the
Three-pronged Osmia, no order governs the succession of the sexes;
only, the series has a marked tendency to begin with females and to
finish with males.The mother occupies herself at the start with the stronger sex, the
more necessary, the better-gifted, the female sex, to which she devotes
the first flush of her laying and the fullness of her vigour; later,
when she is perhaps already at the end of her strength, she bestows
what remains of her maternal solicitude upon the weaker sex, the
less-gifted, almost negligible male sex.There are, however, other
species where this law becomes absolute, constant and regular.In order to go more deeply into this curious question I installed some
hives of a new kind on the sunniest walls of my enclosure.They
consisted of stumps of the great reed of the south, open at one end,
closed at the other by the natural knot and gathered into a sort of
enormous pan-pipe, such as Polyphemus might have employed.The
invitation was accepted: Osmiae came in fairly large numbers, to
benefit by the queer installation.Three Osmiae especially (O. Tricornis, Latr., O. cornuta, Latr., O.
Latreillii, Spin.)gave me splendid results, with reed-stumps arranged
either against the wall of my garden, as I have just said, or near
their customary abode, the huge nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds.One of them, the Three-horned Osmia, did better still: as I have
described, she built her nests in my study, as plentifully as I could
wish.We will consult this last, who has furnished me with documents beyond
my fondest hopes, and begin by asking her of how many eggs her average
laying consists.Of the whole heap of colonized tubes in my study, or
else out of doors, in the hurdle-reeds and the pan-pipe appliances, the
best-filled contains fifteen cells, with a free space above the series,
a space showing that the laying is ended, for, if the mother had any
more eggs available, she would have lodged them in the room which she
leaves unoccupied.This string of fifteen appears to be rare; it was
the only one that I found.My attempts at indoor rearing, pursued
during two years with glass tubes or reeds, taught me that the
Three-horned Osmia is not much addicted to long series.As though to
decrease the difficulties of the coming deliverance, she prefers short
galleries, in which only a part of the laying is stacked.We must then
follow the same mother in her migration from one dwelling to the next
if we would obtain a complete census of her family.A spot of colour,
dropped on the Bee's thorax with a paint-brush while she is absorbed in
closing up the mouth of the tunnel, enables us to recognize the Osmia
in her various homes.In this way, the swarm that resided in my study furnished me, in the
first year, with an average of twelve cells.Next year, the summer
appeared to be more favourable and the average became rather higher,
reaching fifteen.The most numerous laying performed under my eyes, not
in a tube, but in a succession of Snail-shells, reached the figure of
twenty-six.On the other hand, layings of between eight and ten are not
uncommon.Lastly, taking all my records together, the result is that
the family of the Osmia fluctuates roundabout fifteen in number.I have already spoken of the great differences in size apparent in the
cells of one and the same series.The partitions, at first widely
spaced, draw gradually nearer to one another as they come closer to the
aperture, which implies roomy cells at the back and narrow cells in
front.The contents of these compartments are no less uneven between
one portion and another of the string.Without any exception known to
me, the large cells, those with which the series starts, have more
abundant provisions than the straitened cells with which the series
ends.The heap of honey and pollen in the first is twice or even thrice
as large as that in the second.In the last cells, the most recent in
date, the victuals are but a pinch of pollen, so niggardly in amount
that we wonder what will become of the larva with that meagre ration.One would think that the Osmia, when nearing the end of the laying,
attaches no importance to her last-born, to whom she doles out space
and food so sparingly.The first-born receive the benefit of her early
enthusiasm: theirs is the well-spread table, theirs the spacious
apartments.The work has begun to pall by the time that the last eggs
are laid; and the last-comers have to put up with a scurvy portion of
food and a tiny corner.The difference shows itself in another way after the cocoons are spun.The large cells, those at the back, receive the bulky cocoons; the
small ones, those in front, have cocoons only half or a third as big.Before opening them and ascertaining the sex of the Osmia inside, let
us wait for the transformation into the perfect insect, which will take
place towards the end of summer.If impatience get the better of us, we
can open them at the end of July or in August.The insect is then in
the nymphal stage; and it is easy, under this form, to distinguish the
two sexes by the length of the antennae, which are larger in the males,
and by the glassy protuberances on the forehead, the sign of the future
armour of the females.Well, the small cocoons, those in the narrow
front cells, with their scanty store of provisions, all belong to
males; the big cocoons, those in the spacious and well-stocked cells at
the back, all belong to females.The conclusion is definite: the laying of the Three-horned Osmia
consists of two distinct groups, first a group of females and then a
group of males.With my pan-pipe apparatus displayed on the walls of my enclosure and
with old hurdle-reeds left lying flat out of doors, I obtained the
Horned Osmia in fair quantities.I persuaded Latreille's Osmia to build
her nest in reeds, which she did with a zeal which I was far from
expecting.All that I had to do was to lay some reed-stumps
horizontally within her reach, in the immediate neighbourhood of her
usual haunts, namely, the nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds.Lastly,
I succeeded without difficulty in making her build her nests in the
privacy of my study, with glass tubes for a house.With both these Osmiae, the division of the gallery is the same as with
the Three-horned Osmia.At the back are large cells with plentiful
provisions and widely-spaced partitions; in front, small cells, with
scanty provisions and partitions close together.Also, the larger cells
supplied me with big cocoons and females; the smaller cells gave me
little cocoons and males.The conclusion therefore is exactly the same
in the case of all three Osmiae.These conclusions, as my notes show, apply likewise, in every respect,
to the various species of Mason-bees; and one clear and simple rule
stands out from this collection of facts.Apart from the strange
exception of the Three-pronged Osmia, who mixes the sexes without any
order, the Bees whom I studied and probably a crowd of others produce
first a continuous series of females and then a continuous series of
males, the latter with less provisions and smaller cells.This
distribution of the sexes agrees with what we have long known of the
Hive-bee, who begins her laying with a long sequence of workers, or
sterile females, and ends it with a long sequence of males.The analogy
continues down to the capacity of the cells and the quantities of
provisions.The real females, the Queen-bees, have wax cells
incomparably more spacious than the cells of the males and receive a
much larger amount of food.Everything therefore demonstrates that we
are here in the presence of a general rule.OPTIONAL DETERMINATION OF THE SEXES.Is there nothing beyond a
laying in two series?Are the Osmiae, the Chalicodomae and the rest of
them fatally bound by this distribution of the sexes into two distinct
groups, the male group following upon the female group, without any
mixing of the two?Is the mother absolutely powerless to make a change
in this arrangement, should circumstances require it?The Three-pronged Osmia already shows us that the problem is far from
being solved.In the same bramble-stump, the two sexes occur very
irregularly, as though at random.Why this mixture in the series of
cocoons of a Bee closely related to the Horned Osmia and the
Three-horned Osmia, who stack theirs methodically by separate sexes in
the hollow of a reed?What the Bee of the brambles does cannot her
kinswomen of the reeds do too?Nothing, so far as I know, explains this
fundamental difference in a physiological act of primary importance.The three Bees belong to the same genus; they resemble one another in
general outline, internal structure and habits; and, with this close
similarity, we suddenly find a strange dissimilarity.There is just one thing that might possibly arouse a suspicion of the
cause of this irregularity in the Three-pronged Osmia's laying.If I
open a bramble-stump in the winter to examine the Osmia's nest, I find
it impossible, in the vast majority of cases, to distinguish positively
between a female and a male cocoon: the difference in size is so small.The cells, moreover, have the same capacity: the diameter of the
cylinder is the same throughout and the partitions are almost always
the same distance apart.If I open it in July, the victualling-period,
it is impossible for me to distinguish between the provisions destined
for the males and those destined for the females.The measurement of
the column of honey gives practically the same depth in all the cells.We find an equal quantity of space and food for both sexes.This result makes us foresee what a direct examination of the two sexes
in the adult form tells us.The male does not differ materially from
the female in respect of size.If he is a trifle smaller, it is
scarcely noticeable, whereas, in the Horned Osmia and the Three-horned
Osmia, the male is only half or a third the size of the female, as we
have seen from the respective bulk of their cocoons.In the Mason-bee
of the Walls there is also a difference in size, though less
pronounced.The Three-pronged Osmia has not therefore to trouble about adjusting
the dimensions of the dwelling and the quantity of the food to the sex
of the egg which she is about to lay; the measure is the same from one
end of the series to the other.It does not matter if the sexes
alternate without order: one and all will find what they need, whatever
their position in the row.The two other Osmiae, with their great
disparity in size between the two sexes, have to be careful about the
twofold consideration of board and lodging.The more I thought about this curious question, the more probable it
appeared to me that the irregular series of the Three-pronged Osmia and
the regular series of the other Osmiae and of the Bees in general were
all traceable to a common law.It seemed to me that the arrangement in
a succession first of females and then of males did not account for
everything.And I was right: that
arrangement in series is only a tiny fraction of the reality, which is
remarkable in a very different way.This is what I am going to prove by
experiment.The succession first of females and then of males is not, in fact,
invariable.Thus, the Chalicodoma, whose nests serve for two or three
generations, ALWAYS lays male eggs in the old male cells, which can be
recognized by their lesser capacity, and female eggs in the old female
cells of more spacious dimensions.This presence of both sexes at a time, even when there are but two
cells free, one spacious and the other small, proves in the plainest
fashion that the regular distribution observed in the complete nests of
recent production is here replaced by an irregular distribution,
harmonizing with the number and holding-capacity of the chambers to be
stocked.The Mason-bee has before her, let me suppose, only five vacant
cells: two larger and three smaller.The total space at her disposal
would do for about a third of the laying.Well, in the two large cells,
she puts females; in the three small cells she puts males.As we find the same sort of thing in all the old nests, we must needs
admit that the mother knows the sex of the eggs which she is going to
lay, because that egg is placed in a cell of the proper capacity.We
can go further, and admit that the mother alters the order of
succession of the sexes at her pleasure, because her layings, between
one old nest and another, are broken up into small groups of males and
females according to the exigencies of space in the actual nest which
she happens to be occupying.Here then is the Chalicodoma, when mistress of an old nest of which she
has not the power to alter the arrangement, breaking up her laying into
sections comprising both sexes just as required by the conditions
imposed upon her.She therefore decides the sex of the egg at will,
for, without this prerogative, she could not, in the chambers of the
nest which she owes to chance, deposit unerringly the sex for which
those chambers were originally built; and this happens however small
the number of chambers to be filled.When the mother herself founds the dwelling, when she lays the first
rows of bricks, the females come first and the males at the finish.But, when she is in the presence of an old nest, of which she is quite
unable to alter the general arrangement, how is she to make use of a
few vacant rooms, the large and small alike, if the sex of the egg be
already irrevocably fixed?She can only do so by abandoning the
arrangement in two consecutive rows and accommodating her laying to the
varied exigencies of the home.Either she finds it impossible to make
an economical use of the old nest, a theory refuted by the evidence, or
else she determines at will the sex of the egg which she is about to
lay.The Osmiae themselves will furnish the most conclusive evidence on the
latter point.We have seen that these Bees are not generally miners,
who themselves dig out the foundation of their cells.They make use of
the old structures of others, or else of natural retreats, such as
hollow stems, the spirals of empty shells and various hiding-places in
walls, clay or wood.Their work is confined to repairs to the house,
such as partitions and covers.There are plenty of these retreats; and
the insects would always find first-class ones if it thought of going
any distance to look for them.But the Osmia is a stay-at-home: she
returns to her birthplace and clings to it with a patience extremely
difficult to exhaust.It is here, in this little familiar corner, that
she prefers to settle her progeny.But then the apartments are few in
number and of all shapes and sizes.There are long and short ones,
spacious ones and narrow.Short of expatriating herself, a Spartan
course, she has to use them all, from first to last, for she has no
choice.Guided by these considerations, I embarked on the experiments
which I will now describe.I have said how my study became a populous hive, in which the
Three-horned Osmia built her nests in the various appliances which I
had prepared for her.Among these appliances, tubes, either of glass or
reed, predominated.There were tubes of all lengths and widths.In the
long tubes, entire or almost entire layings, with a series of females
followed by a series of males, were deposited.As I have already
referred to this result, I will not discuss it again.The short tubes
were sufficiently varied in length to lodge one or other portion of the
total laying.Basing my calculations on the respective lengths of the
cocoons of the two sexes, on the thickness of the partitions and the
final lid, I shortened some of these to the exact dimensions required
for two cocoons only, of different sexes.Well, these short tubes, whether of glass or reed, were seized upon as
eagerly as the long tubes.Moreover, they yielded this splendid result:
their contents, only a part of the total laying, always began with
female and ended with male cocoons.This order was invariable; what
varied was the number of cells in the long tubes and the proportion
between the two sorts of cocoons, sometimes males predominating and
sometimes females.When confronted with tubes too small to receive all her family, the
Osmia is in the same plight as the Mason-bee in the presence of an old
nest.She thereupon acts exactly as the Chalicodoma does.She breaks up
her laying, divides it into series as short as the room at her disposal
demands; and each series begins with females and ends with males.This
breaking up, on the one hand, into sections in all of which both sexes
are represented and the division, on the other hand, of the entire
laying into just two groups, one female, the other male, when the
length of the tube permits, surely provide us with ample evidence of
the insect's power to regulate the sex of the egg according to the
exigencies of space.And besides the exigencies of space one might perhaps venture to add
those connected with the earlier development of the males.These burst
their cocoons a couple of weeks or more before the females; they are
the first who hasten to the sweets of the almond-tree.In order to
release themselves and emerge into the glad sunlight without disturbing
the string of cocoons wherein their sisters are still sleeping, they
must occupy the upper end of the row; and this, no doubt, is the reason
that makes the Osmia end each of her broken layings with males.Being
next to the door, these impatient ones will leave the home without
upsetting the shells that are slower in hatching.I had offered at the same time to the Osmiae in my study some old nests
of the Mason-bee of the Shrubs, which are clay spheroids with
cylindrical cavities in them.These cavities are formed, as in the old
nests of the Mason-bee of the Pebbles, of the cell properly so-called
and of the exit-way which the perfect insect cut through the outer
coating at the time of its deliverance.The diameter is about 7
millimetres (.273 inch.--Translator's Note.); their depth at the centre
of the heap is 23 millimetres (.897 inch.--Translator's Note.)and at
the edge averages 14 millimetres.(.546 inch.--Translator's Note.)The deep central cells receive only the females of the Osmia; sometimes
even the two sexes together, with a partition in the middle, the female
occupying the lower and the male the upper storey.Lastly, the deeper
cavities on the circumference are allotted to females and the shallower
to males.We know that the Three-horned Osmia prefers to haunt the habitations of
the Bees who nidify in populous colonies, such as the Mason-bee of the
Sheds and the Hairy-footed Anthophora, in whose nests I have noted
similar facts.The choice rests with the mother,
who is guided by considerations of space and, according to the
accommodation at her disposal, which is frequently fortuitous and
incapable of modification, places a female in this cell and a male in
that, so that both may have a dwelling of a size suited to their
unequal development.This is the unimpeachable evidence of the numerous
and varied facts which I have set forth.People unfamiliar with insect
anatomy--the public for whom I write--would probably give the following
explanation of this marvellous prerogative of the Bee: the mother has
at her disposal a certain number of eggs, some of which are irrevocably
female and the others irrevocably male: she is able to pick out of
either group the one which she wants at the actual moment; and her
choice is decided by the holding capacity of the cell that has to be
stocked.Everything would then be limited to a judicious selection from
the heap of eggs.Should this idea occur to him, the reader must hasten to reject it.Nothing could be more false, as the most casual reference to anatomy
will show.The female reproductive apparatus of the Hymenoptera
consists generally of six ovarian tubes, something like glove-fingers,
divided into bunches of three and ending in a common canal, the
oviduct, which carries the eggs outside.Each of these glove-fingers is
fairly wide at the base, but tapers sharply towards the tip, which is
closed.It contains, arranged in a row, one after the other, like beads
on a string, a certain number of eggs, five or six for instance, of
which the lower ones are more or less developed, the middle ones
halfway towards maturity, and the upper ones very rudimentary.Every
stage of evolution is here represented, distributed regularly from
bottom to top, from the verge of maturity to the vague outlines of the
embryo.The sheath clasps its string of ovules so closely that any
inversion of the order is impossible.Besides, an inversion would
result in a gross absurdity: the replacing of a riper egg by another in
an earlier stage of development.Therefore, in each ovarian tube, in each glove-finger, the emergence of
the eggs occurs according to the order governing their arrangement in
the common sheath; and any other sequence is absolutely impossible.Moreover, at the nesting-period, the six ovarian sheaths, one by one
and each in its turn, have at their base an egg which in a very short
time swells enormously.Some hours or even a day before the laying,
that egg by itself represents or even exceeds in bulk the whole of the
ovigerous apparatus.This is the egg which is on the point of being
laid.It is about to descend into the oviduct, in its proper order, at
its proper time; and the mother has no power to make another take its
place.It is this egg, necessarily this egg and no other, that will
presently be laid upon the provisions, whether these be a mess of honey
or a live prey; it alone is ripe, it alone lies at the entrance to the
oviduct; none of the others, since they are farther back in the row and
not at the right stage of development, can be substituted at this
crisis.What will it yield, a male or a female?No lodging has been prepared,
no food collected for it; and yet both food and lodging have to be in
keeping with the sex that will proceed from it.And here is a much more
puzzling condition: the sex of that egg, whose advent is predestined,
has to correspond with the space which the mother happens to have found
for a cell.There is therefore no room for hesitation, strange though
the statement may appear: the egg, as it descends from its ovarian
tube, has no determined sex.It is perhaps during the few hours of its
rapid development at the base of its ovarian sheath, it is perhaps on
its passage through the oviduct that it receives, at the mother's
pleasure, the final impress that will produce, to match the cradle
which it has to fill, either a female or a male.Let us admit that,
when the normal conditions remain, a laying would have yielded m
females and n males.Then, if my conclusions are correct, it must be in
the mother's power, when the conditions are different, to take from the
m group and increase the n group to the same extent; it must be
possible for her laying to be represented as m - 1, m - 2, m - 3, etc.females and by n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, etc.males, the sum of m + n
remaining constant, but one of the sexes being partly permuted into the
other.The ultimate conclusion even cannot be disregarded: we must
admit a set of eggs represented by m - m, or zero, females and of n + m
males, one of the sexes being completely replaced by the other.Conversely, it must be possible for the feminine series to be augmented
from the masculine series to the extent of absorbing it entirely.It
was to solve this question and some others connected with it that I
undertook, for the second time, to rear the Three-horned Osmia in my
study.The problem on this occasion is a more delicate one; but I am also
better-equipped.My apparatus consists of two small closed
packing-cases, with the front side of each pierced with forty holes, in
which I can insert my glass tubes and keep them in a horizontal
position.I thus obtain for the Bees the darkness and mystery which
suit their work and for myself the power of withdrawing from my hive,
at any time, any tube that I wish, with the Osmia inside, so as to
carry it to the light and follow, if need be with the aid of the lens,
the operations of the busy worker.My investigations, however frequent
and minute, in no way hinder the peaceable Bee, who remains absorbed in
her maternal duties.I mark a plentiful number of my guests with a variety of dots on the
thorax, which enables me to follow any one Osmia from the beginning to
the end of her laying.The tubes and their respective holes are
numbered; a list, always lying open on my desk, enables me to note from
day to day, sometimes from hour to hour, what happens in each tube and
particularly the actions of the Osmiae whose backs bear distinguishing
marks.As soon as one tube is filled, I replace it by another.Moreover, I have scattered in front of either hive a few handfuls of
empty Snail-shells, specially chosen for the object which I have in
view.Reasons which I will explain later led me to prefer the shells of
Helix caespitum.Each of the shells, as and when stocked, received the
date of the laying and the alphabetical sign corresponding with the
Osmia to whom it belonged.In this way, I spent five or six weeks in
continual observation.To succeed in an enquiry, the first and foremost
condition is patience.This condition I fulfilled; and it was rewarded
with the success which I was justified in expecting.The first, which are cylindrical
and of the same width throughout, will be of use for confirming the
facts observed in the first year of my experiments in indoor rearing.The others, the majority, consist of two cylinders which are of very
different diameters, set end to end.The front cylinder, the one which
projects a little way outside the hive and forms the entrance-hole,
varies in width between 8 and 12 millimetres.(Between.312 and.468
inch.--Translator's Note.)The second, the back one, contained entirely
within my packing-case, is closed at its far end and is 5 to 6
millimetres in diameter.(.195 to.234 inch.--Translator's Note.)Each
of the two parts of the double-galleried tunnel, one narrow and one
wide, measures at most a decimetre in length.(3.9
inches.--Translator's Note.)I thought it advisable to have these short
tubes, as the Osmia is thus compelled to select different lodgings,
each of them being insufficient in itself to accommodate the total
laying.In this way I shall obtain a greater variety in the
distribution of the sexes.Lastly, at the mouth of each tube, which
projects slightly outside the case, there is a little paper tongue,
forming a sort of perch on which the Osmia alights on her arrival and
giving easy access to the house.With these facilities, the swarm
colonized fifty-two double-galleried tubes, thirty-seven cylindrical
tubes, seventy-eight Snail-shells and a few old nests of the Mason-bee
of the Shrubs.From this rich mine of material I will take what I want
to prove my case.Every series, even when incomplete, begins with females and ends with
males.To this rule I have not yet found an exception, at least in
galleries of normal diameter.In each new abode the mother busies
herself first of all with the more important sex.Bearing this point in
mind, would it be possible for me, by manoeuvring, to obtain an
inversion of this order and make the laying begin with males?I think
so, from the results already ascertained and the irresistible
conclusions to be drawn from them.The double-galleried tubes are
installed in order to put my conjectures to the proof.The back gallery, 5 or 6 millimetres wide (.195 to.234
inch.--Translator's Note.), is too narrow to serve as a lodging for
normally developed females.If, therefore, the Osmia, who is very
economical of her space, wishes to occupy them, she will be obliged to
establish males there.And her laying must necessarily begin here,
because this corner is the rear-most part of the tube.The foremost
gallery is wide, with an entrance-door on the front of the hive.Here,
finding the conditions to which she is accustomed, the mother will go
on with her laying in the order which she prefers.Of the fifty-two double-galleried
tubes, about a third did not have their narrow passage colonized.The
Osmia closed its aperture communicating with the large passage; and the
latter alone received the eggs.The
female Osmiae, though nearly always larger than the males, present
marked differences among one another: some are bigger, some are
smaller.I had to adjust the width of the narrow galleries to Bees of
average dimensions.It may happen therefore that a gallery is too small
to admit the large-sized mothers to whom chance allots it.When the
Osmia is unable to enter the tube, obviously she will not colonize it.She then closes the entrance to this space which she cannot use and
does her laying beyond it, in the wide tube.Had I tried to avoid these
useless apparatus by choosing tubes of larger calibre, I should have
encountered another drawback: the medium-sized mothers, finding
themselves almost comfortable, would have decided to lodge females
there.I had to be prepared for it: as each mother selected her house
at will and as I was unable to interfere in her choice, a narrow tube
would be colonized or not, according as the Osmia who owned it was or
was not able to make her way inside.There remain some forty pairs of tubes with both galleries colonized.In these there are two things to take into consideration.The narrow
rear tubes of 5 or 5 1/2 millimetres (.195 to.214 inch.--Translator's
Note.)--and these are the most numerous--contain males and males only,
but in short series, between one and five.The mother is here so much
hampered in her work that they are rarely occupied from end to end; the
Osmia seems in a hurry to leave them and to go and colonize the front
tube, whose ample space will leave her the liberty of movement
necessary for her operations.The other rear tubes, the minority, whose
diameter is about 6 millimetres (.234 inch.--Translator's Note.),
contain sometimes only females and sometimes females at the back and
males towards the opening.One can see that a tube a trifle wider and a
mother slightly smaller would account for this difference in the
results.Nevertheless, as the necessary space for a female is barely
provided in this case, we see that the mother avoids as far as she can
a two-sex arrangement beginning with males and that she adopts it only
in the last extremity.Finally, whatever the contents of the small tube
may be, those of the large one, following upon it, never vary and
consist of females at the back and males in front.Though incomplete, because of circumstances very difficult to control,
the result of the experiment is none the less very remarkable.Twenty-five apparatus contain only males in their narrow gallery, in
numbers varying from a minimum of one to a maximum of five.After these
comes the colony of the large gallery, beginning with females and
ending with males.And the layings in these apparatus do not always
belong to late summer or even to the intermediate period: a few small
tubes contain the earliest eggs of the entire swarm.A couple of
Osmiae, more forward than the others, set to work on the 23rd of April.Both of them started their laying by placing males in the narrow tubes.The meagre supply of provisions was enough in itself to show the sex,
which proved later to be in accordance with my anticipations.We see
then that, by my artifices, the whole swarm starts with the converse of
the normal order.This inversion is continued, at no matter what
period, from the beginning to the end of the operations.The series
which, according to rule, would begin with females now begins with
males.Once the larger gallery is reached, the laying is pursued in the
usual order.We have advanced one step and that no small one: we have seen that the
Osmia, when circumstances require it, is capable of reversing the
sequence of the sexes.Would it be possible, provided that the tube
were long enough, to obtain a complete inversion, in which the entire
series of the males should occupy the narrow gallery at the back and
the entire series of the females the roomy gallery in front?I think
not; and I will tell you why.Long and narrow cylinders are by no means to the Osmia's taste, not
because of their narrowness but because of their length.Observe that
for each load of honey brought the worker is obliged to move backwards
twice.She enters, head first, to begin by disgorging the honey-syrup
from her crop.Unable to turn in a passage which she blocks entirely,
she goes out backwards, crawling rather than walking, a laborious
performance on the polished surface of the glass and a performance
which, with any other surface, would still be very awkward, as the
wings are bound to rub against the wall with their free end and are
liable to get rumpled or bent.She goes out backwards, reaches the
outside, turns round and goes in again, but this time the opposite way,
so as to brush off the load of pollen from her abdomen on to the heap.If the gallery is at all long, this crawling backwards becomes
troublesome after a time; and the Osmia soon abandons a passage that is
too small to allow of free movement.I have said that the narrow tubes
of my apparatus are, for the most part, only very incompletely
colonized.The Bee, after lodging a small number of males in them,
hastens to leave them.In the wide front gallery she can stay where she
is and still be able to turn round easily for her different
manipulations; she will avoid those two long journeys backwards, which
are so exhausting and so bad for her wings.Another reason no doubt prompts her not to make too great a use of the
narrow passage, in which she would establish males, followed by females
in the part where the gallery widens.The males have to leave their
cells a couple of weeks or more before the females.If they occupy the
back of the house they will die prisoners or else they will overturn
everything on their way out.This risk is avoided by the order which
the Osmia adopts.In my tubes, with their unusual arrangement, the mother might well find
the dilemma perplexing: there is the narrowness of the space at her
disposal and there is the emergence later on.In the narrow tubes, the
width is insufficient for the females; on the other hand, if she lodges
males there, they are liable to perish, since they will be prevented
from issuing at the proper moment.This would perhaps explain the
mother's hesitation and her obstinacy in settling females in some of my
apparatus which looked as if they could suit none but males.A suspicion occurs to me, a suspicion aroused by my attentive
examination of the narrow tubes.All, whatever the number of their
inmates, are carefully plugged at the opening, just as separate tubes
would be.It might therefore be the case that the narrow gallery at the
back was looked upon by the Osmia not as the prolongation of the large
front gallery, but as an independent tube.The facility with which the
worker turns as soon as she reaches the wide tube, her liberty of
action, which is now as great as in a doorway communicating with the
outer air, might well be misleading and cause the Osmia to treat the
narrow passage at the back as though the wide passage in front did not
exist.This would account for the placing of the female in the large
tube above the males in the small tube, an arrangement contrary to her
custom.I will not undertake to decide whether the mother really appreciates
the danger of my snares, or whether she makes a mistake in considering
only the space at her disposal and beginning with males, who are liable
to remain imprisoned.At any rate, I perceive a tendency to deviate as
little as possible from the order which safeguards the emergence of
both sexes.This tendency is demonstrated by her repugnance to
colonizing my narrow tubes with long series of males.However, so far
as we are concerned, it does not matter much what passes at such times
in the Osmia's little brain.Enough for us to know that she dislikes
narrow and long tubes, not because they are narrow, but because they
are at the same time long.And, in fact, she does very well with a short tube of the same
diameter.Such are the cells in the old nests of the Mason-bee of the
Shrubs and the empty shells of the Garden Snail.With the short tube
the two disadvantages of the long tube are avoided.She has very little
of that crawling backwards to do when she has a Snail-shell for the
home of her eggs and scarcely any when the home is the cell of the
Mason-bee.Moreover, as the stack of cocoons numbers two or three at
most, the deliverance will be exempt from the difficulties attached to
a long series.To persuade the Osmia to nidify in a single tube long
enough to receive the whole of her laying and at the same time narrow
enough to leave her only just the possibility of admittance appears to
me a project without the slightest chance of success: the Bee would
stubbornly refuse such a dwelling or would content herself with
entrusting only a very small portion of her eggs to it.On the other
hand, with narrow but short cavities, success, without being easy,
seems to me at least quite possible.Guided by these considerations, I
embarked upon the most arduous part of my problem: to obtain the
complete or almost complete permutation of one sex with the other; to
produce a laying consisting only of males by offering the mother a
series of lodgings suited only to males.Let us in the first place consult the old nests of the Mason-bee of the
Shrubs.I have said that these mortar spheroids, pierced all over with
little cylindrical cavities, are a adopted pretty eagerly by the
Three-horned Osmia, who colonizes them before my eyes with females in
the deep cells and males in the shallow cells.That is how things go
when the old nest remains in its natural state.With a grater, however,
I scrape the outside of another nest so as to reduce the depth of the
cavities to some ten millimetres.(About two-fifths of an
inch.--Translator's Note.)This leaves in each cell just room for one
cocoon, surmounted by the closing stopper.Of the fourteen cavities in
the nests, I leave two intact, measuring fifteen millimetres in depth.(.585 inch.--Translator's Note.)Nothing could be more striking than
the result of this experiment, made in the first year of my home
rearing.The twelve cavities whose depth had been reduced all received
males; the two cavities left untouched received females.A year passes and I repeat the experiment with a nest of fifteen cells;
but this time all the cells are reduced to the minimum depth with the
grater.Well, the fifteen cells, from first to last, are occupied by
males.It must be quite understood that, in each case, all the
offspring belonged to one mother, marked with her distinguishing dot
and kept in sight as long as her laying lasted.He would indeed be
difficult to please who refused to bow before the results of these two
experiments.If, however, he is not yet convinced, here is something to
remove his last doubts.The Three-horned Osmia often settles her family in old shells,
especially those of the Common Snail (Helix aspersa), who is so common
under the stone-heaps and in the crevices of the little unmortared
walls that support our terraces.In this species the spiral is wide
open, so that the Osmia, penetrating as far down as the helical passage
permits, finds, immediately above the point which is too narrow to
pass, the space necessary for the cell of a female.This cell is
succeeded by others, wider still, always for females, arranged in a
line in the same way as in a straight tube.In the last whorl of the
spiral, the diameter would be too great for a single row.Then
longitudinal partitions are added to the transverse partitions, the
whole resulting in cells of unequal dimensions in which males
predominate, mixed with a few females in the lower storeys.The
sequence of the sexes is therefore what it would be in a straight tube
and especially in a tube with a wide bore, where the partitioning is
complicated by subdivisions on the same level.A single Snail-shell
contains room for six or eight cells.A large, rough earthen stopper
finishes the nest at the entrance to the shell.As a dwelling of this sort could show us nothing new, I chose for my
swarm the Garden Snail (Helix caespitum), whose shell, shaped like a
small swollen Ammonite, widens by slow degrees, the diameter of the
usable portion, right up to the mouth, being hardly greater than that
required by a male Osmia-cocoon.Moreover, the widest part, in which a
female might find room, has to receive a thick stopping-plug, below
which there will often be a free space.Under all these conditions, the
house will hardly suit any but males arranged one after the other.The collection of shells placed at the foot of each hive includes
specimens of different sizes.The smallest are 18 millimetres (.7
inch.--Translator's Note.)in diameter and the largest 24 millimetres.(.936 inch.--Translator's Note.)There is room for two cocoons, or
three at most, according to their dimensions.Now these shells were used by my visitors without any hesitation,
perhaps even with more eagerness than the glass tubes, whose slippery
sides might easily be a little annoying to the Bee.Some of them were
occupied on the first few days of the laying; and the Osmia who had
started with a home of this sort would pass next to a second
Snail-shell, in the immediate neighbourhood of the first, to a third, a
fourth and others still, always close together, until her ovaries were
emptied.The whole family of one mother would thus be lodged in
Snail-shells which were duly marked with the date of the laying and a
description of the worker.The faithful adherents of the Snail-shell
were in the minority.The greater number left the tubes to come to the
shells and then went back from the shells to the tubes.All, after
filling the spiral staircase with two or three cells, closed the house
with a thick earthen stopper on a level with the opening.It was a long
and troublesome task, in which the Osmia displayed all her patience as
a mother and all her talents as a plasterer.When the pupae are sufficiently matured, I proceed to examine these
elegant abodes.The contents fill me with joy: they fulfil my
anticipations to the letter.The great, the very great majority of the
cocoons turn out to be males; here and there, in the bigger cells, a
few rare females appear.The smallness of the space has almost done
away with the stronger sex.This result is demonstrated by the
sixty-eight Snail-shells colonized.But, of this total number, I must
use only those series which received an entire laying and were occupied
by the same Osmia from the beginning to the end of the egg-season.Here
are a few examples, taken from among the most conclusive.From the 6th of May, when she started operations, to the 25th of May,
the date at which her laying ceased, one Osmia occupied seven
Snail-shells in succession.Her family consists of fourteen cocoons, a
number very near the average; and, of these fourteen cocoons, twelve
belong to males and only two to females.Another, between the 9th and 27th of May, stocked six Snail-shells with
a family of thirteen, including ten males and three females.A third, between the 2nd and 29th of May colonized eleven Snail-shells,
a prodigious task.She supplied me with a family of twenty-six, the largest which I have
ever obtained from one Osmia.Well, this abnormal progeny consisted of
twenty-five males and one female.There is no need to go on, after this magnificent example, especially
as the other series would all, without exception, give us the same
result.Two facts are immediately obvious: the Osmia is able to reverse
the order of her laying and to start with a more or less long series of
males before producing any females.There is something better still;
and this is the proposition which I was particularly anxious to prove:
the female sex can be permuted with the male sex and can be permuted to
the point of disappearing altogether.We see this especially in the
third case, where the presence of a solitary female in a family of
twenty-six is due to the somewhat larger diameter of the corresponding
Snail-shell.There would still remain the inverse permutation: to obtain only
females and no males, or very few.The first permutation makes the
second seem very probable, although I cannot as yet conceive a means of
realizing it.The only condition which I can regulate is the dimensions
of the home.When the rooms are small, the males abound and the females
tend to disappear.With generous quarters, the converse would not take
place.I should obtain females and afterwards an equal number of males,
confined in small cells which, in case of need, would be bounded by
numerous partitions.The factor of space does not enter into the
question here.What artifice can we then employ to provoke this second
permutation?So far, I can think of nothing that is worth attempting.Leading a retired life, in the solitude of a
village, having quite enough to do with patiently and obscurely
ploughing my humble furrow, I know little about modern scientific
views.In my young days I had a passionate longing for books and found
it difficult to procure them; to-day, when I could almost have them if
I wanted, I am ceasing to wish for them.It is what usually happens as
life goes on.I do not therefore know what may have been done in the
direction whither this study of the sexes has led me.If I am stating
propositions that are really new or at least more comprehensive than
the propositions already known, my words will perhaps sound heretical.No matter: as a simple translator of facts, I do not hesitate to make
my statement, being fully persuaded that time will turn my heresy into
orthodoxy.Bees lay their eggs in series of first females and then males, when the
two sexes are of different sizes and demand an unequal quantity of
nourishment.When the two sexes are alike in size, as in the case of
Latreille's Osmia, the same sequence may occur, but less regularly.This dual arrangement disappears when the place chosen for the nest is
not large enough to contain the entire laying.We then see broken
layings, beginning with females and ending with males.The egg, as it issues from the ovary, has not yet a fixed sex.The
final impress that produces the sex is given at the moment of laying,
or a little before.So as to be able to give each larva the amount of space and food that
suits it according as it is male or female, the mother can choose the
sex of the egg which she is about to lay.To meet the conditions of the
building, which is often the work of another or else a natural retreat
that admits of little or no alteration, she lays either a male egg or a
female egg AS SHE PLEASES.The distribution of the sexes depends upon
herself.Should circumstances require it, the order of the laying can
be reversed and begin with males; lastly, the entire laying can contain
only one sex.The same privilege is possessed by the predatory Hymenoptera, the
Wasps, at least by those in whom the two sexes are of a different size
and consequently require an amount of nourishment that is larger in the
one case than in the other.The mother must know the sex of the egg
which she is going to lay; she must be able to choose the sex of that
egg so that each larva may obtain its proper portion of food.Generally speaking, when the sexes are of different sizes, every insect
that collects food and prepares or selects a dwelling for its offspring
must be able to choose the sex of the egg in order to satisfy without
mistake the conditions imposed upon it.The question remains how this optional assessment of the sexes is
effected.If I should ever learn
anything about this delicate point, I shall owe it to some happy chance
for which I must wait, or rather watch, patiently.Then what explanation shall I give of the wonderful facts which I have
set forth?I do not explain facts, I relate
them.Growing daily more sceptical of the interpretations suggested to
me and more hesitating as to those which I myself may have to suggest,
the more I observe and experiment, the more clearly I see rising out of
the black mists of possibility an enormous note of interrogation.Dear insects, my study of you has sustained me and continues to sustain
me in my heaviest trials; I must take leave of you for to-day.The
ranks are thinning around me and the long hopes have fled.Shall I be
able to speak of you again?(This forms the closing paragraph of Volume
3 of the "Souvenirs entomologiques," of which the author lived to
publish seven more volumes, containing over 2,500 pages and nearly
850,000 words.--Translator's Note.)Few insects in our climes vie in popular fame with the Glow-worm, that
curious little animal which, to celebrate the little joys of life,
kindles a beacon at its tail-end.Who does not know it, at least by
name?Who has not seen it roam amid the grass, like a spark fallen from
the moon at its full?The Greeks of old called it lampouris, meaning,
the bright-tailed.Science employs the same term: it calls it the
lantern-bearer, Lampyris noctiluca, Lin.In this case the common name
is inferior to the scientific phrase, which, when translated, becomes
both expressive and accurate.In fact, we might easily cavil at the word "worm."The Lampyris is not
a worm at all, not even in general appearance.He has six short legs,
which he well knows how to use; he is a gad-about, a trot-about.In the
adult state the male is correctly garbed in wing-cases, like the true
Beetle that he is.The female is an ill-favoured thing who knows naught
of the delights of flying: all her life long she retains the larval
shape, which, for the rest, is similar to that of the male, who himself
is imperfect so long as he has not achieved the maturity that comes
with pairing-time.Even in this initial stage the word "worm" is out of
place.We French have the expression "Naked as a worm" to point to the
lack of any defensive covering.Now the Lampyris is clothed, that is to
say, he wears an epidermis of some consistency; moreover, he is rather
richly : his body is dark brown all over, set off with pale
pink on the thorax, especially on the lower surface.Finally, each
segment is decked at the hinder edge with two spots of a fairly bright
red.A costume like this was never worn by a worm.Let us leave this ill-chosen denomination and ask ourselves what the
Lampyris feeds upon.That master of the art of gastronomy,
Brillat-Savarin, said: "Show me what you eat and I will tell you what
you are."A similar question should be addressed, by way of a preliminary, to
every insect whose habits we propose to study, for, from the least to
the greatest in the zoological progression, the stomach sways the
world; the data supplied by food are the chief of all the documents of
life.Well, in spite of his innocent appearance, the Lampyris is an
eater of flesh, a hunter of game; and he follows his calling with rare
villainy.This detail has long been known to entomologists.What is not so well
known, what is not known at all yet, to judge by what I have read, is
the curious method of attack, of which I have seen no other instance
anywhere.Before he begins to feast, the Glow-worm administers an anaesthetic: he
chloroforms his victim, rivalling in the process the wonders of our
modern surgery, which renders the patient insensible before operating
on him.The usual game is a small Snail hardly the size of a cherry,
such as, for instance, Helix variabilis, Drap., who, in the hot
weather, collects in clusters on the stiff stubble and other long, dry
stalks by the road-side and there remains motionless, in profound
meditation, throughout the scorching summer days.It is in some such
resting-place as this that I have often been privileged to light upon
the Lampyris banqueting on the prey which he had just paralysed on its
shaky support by his surgical artifices.He frequents the edges of the
irrigating ditches, with their cool soil, their varied vegetation, a
favourite haunt of the Mollusc.Here, he treats the game on the ground;
and, under these conditions, it is easy for me to rear him at home and
to follow the operator's performance down to the smallest detail.I will try to make the reader a witness of the strange sight.I place a
little grass in a wide glass jar.In this I instal a few Glow-worms and
a provision of snails of a suitable size, neither too large nor too
small, chiefly Helix variabilis.Above
all, we must keep an assiduous watch, for the desired events come
unexpectedly and do not last long.The Glow-worm for a moment investigates the prey,
which, according to its habit, is wholly withdrawn in the shell, except
the edge of the mantle, which projects slightly.Then the hunter's
weapon is drawn, a very simple weapon, but one that cannot be plainly
perceived without the aid of a lens.It consists of two mandibles bent
back powerfully into a hook, very sharp and as thin as a hair.The
microscope reveals the presence of a slender groove running throughout
the length.The insect repeatedly taps the Snail's mantle with its instrument.It
all happens with such gentleness as to suggest kisses rather than
bites.As children, teasing one another, we used to talk of "tweaksies"
to express a slight squeeze of the finger-tips, something more like a
tickling than a serious pinch.In conversing with
animals, language loses nothing by remaining juvenile.It is the right
way for the simple to understand one another.The Lampyris doles out his tweaks.He distributes them methodically,
without hurrying, and takes a brief rest after each of them, as though
he wished to ascertain the effect produced.Their number is not great:
half a dozen, at most, to subdue the prey and deprive it of all power
of movement.That other pinches are administered later, at the time of
eating, seems very likely, but I cannot say anything for certain,
because the sequel escapes me.The first few, however--there are never
many--are enough to impart inertia and loss of all feeling to the
Mollusc, thanks to the prompt, I might almost say lightning, methods of
the Lampyris, who, beyond a doubt, instils some poison or other by
means of his grooved hooks.Here is the proof of the sudden efficacy of those twitches, so mild in
appearance: I take the Snail from the Lampyris, who has operated on the
edge of the mantle some four or five times.I prick him with a fine
needle in the fore-part, which the animal, shrunk into its shell, still
leaves exposed.There is no quiver of the wounded tissues, no reaction
against the brutality of the needle.A corpse itself could not give
fewer signs of life.Here is something even more conclusive: chance occasionally gives me
Snails attacked by the Lampyris while they are creeping along, the foot
slowly crawling, the tentacles swollen to their full extent.A few
disordered movements betray a brief excitement on the part of the
Mollusc and then everything ceases: the foot no longer slugs; the front
part loses its graceful swan-neck curve; the tentacles become limp and
give way under their own weight, dangling feebly like a broken stick.Not at all, for I can resuscitate the seeming
corpse at will.After two or three days of that singular condition
which is no longer life and yet not death, I isolate the patient and,
though this is not really essential to success, I give him a douche
which will represent the shower so dear to the able-bodied Mollusc.In
about a couple of days, my prisoner, but lately injured by the
Glow-worm's treachery, is restored to his normal state.He revives, in
a manner; he recovers movement and sensibility.He is affected by the
stimulus of a needle; he shifts his place, crawls, puts out his
tentacles, as though nothing unusual had occurred.The general torpor,
a sort of deep drunkenness, has vanished outright.What name shall we give to that form of existence which, for a
time, abolishes the power of movement and the sense of pain?I can see
but one that is approximately suitable: anaesthesia.The exploits of a
host of Wasps whose flesh-eating grubs are provided with meat that is
motionless though not dead have taught us the skilful art of the
paralysing insect, which numbs the locomotory nerve-centres with its
venom.We have now a humble little animal that first produces complete
anaesthesia in its patient.Human science did not in reality invent
this art, which is one of the wonders of latter-day surgery.Much
earlier, far back in the centuries, the Lampyris and, apparently,
others knew it as well.The animal's knowledge had a long start of
ours; the method alone has changed.Our operators proceed by making us
inhale the fumes of ether or chloroform; the insect proceeds by
injecting a special virus that comes from the mandibular fangs in
infinitesimal doses.Might we not one day be able to benefit from this
hint?What glorious discoveries the future would have in store for us,
if we understood the beastie's secrets better!What does the Lampyris want with anaesthetical talent against a
harmless and moreover eminently peaceful adversary, who would never
begin the quarrel of his own accord?We find in Algeria
a beetle known as Drilus maroccanus, who, though non-luminous,
approaches our Glow-worm in his organization and especially in his
habits.He, too, feeds on Land Molluscs.His prey is a Cyclostome with
a graceful spiral shell, tightly closed with a stony lid which is
attached to the animal by a powerful muscle.The lid is a movable door
which is quickly shut by the inmate's mere withdrawal into his house
and as easily opened when the hermit goes forth.With this system of
closing, the abode becomes inviolable; and the Drilus knows it.Fixed to the surface of the shell by an adhesive apparatus whereof the
Lampyris will presently show us the equivalent, he remains on the
look-out, waiting, if necessary, for whole days at a time.At last the
need of air and food obliges the besieged non-combatant to show
himself: at least, the door is set slightly ajar.The
Drilus is on the spot and strikes his blow.The door can no longer be
closed; and the assailant is henceforth master of the fortress.Our
first impression is that the muscle moving the lid has been cut with a
quick-acting pair of shears.The Drilus is
not well enough equipped with jaws to gnaw through a fleshy mass so
promptly.The operation has to succeed at once, at the first touch: if
not, the animal attacked would retreat, still in full vigour, and the
siege must be recommenced, as arduous as ever, exposing the insect to
fasts indefinitely prolonged.Although I have never come across the
Drilus, who is a stranger to my district, I conjecture a method of
attack very similar to that of the Glow-worm.Like our own Snail-eater,
the Algerian insect does not cut its victim into small pieces: it
renders it inert, chloroforms it by means of a few tweaks which are
easily distributed, if the lid but half-opens for a second.The besieger thereupon enters and, in perfect quiet, consumes a
prey incapable of the least muscular effort.That is how I see things
by the unaided light of logic.Let us now return to the Glow-worm.When the Snail is on the ground,
creeping, or even shrunk into his shell, the attack never presents any
difficulty.The shell possesses no lid and leaves the hermit's
fore-part to a great extent exposed.Here, on the edges of the mantle,
contracted by the fear of danger, the Mollusc is vulnerable and
incapable of defence.But it also frequently happens that the Snail
occupies a raised position, clinging to the tip of a grass-stalk or
perhaps to the smooth surface of a stone.This support serves him as a
temporary lid; it wards off the aggression of any churl who might try
to molest the inhabitant of the cabin, always on the express condition
that no slit show itself anywhere on the protecting circumference.If,
on the other hand, in the frequent case when the shell does not fit its
support quite closely, some point, however tiny, be left uncovered,
this is enough for the subtle tools of the Lampyris, who just nibbles
at the Mollusc and at once plunges him into that profound immobility
which favours the tranquil proceedings of the consumer.The assailant has to
handle his victim gingerly, without provoking contractions which would
make the Snail let go his support and, at the very least, precipitate
him from the tall stalk whereon he is blissfully slumbering.Now any
game falling to the ground would seem to be so much sheer loss, for the
Glow-worm has no great zeal for hunting-expeditions: he profits by the
discoveries which good luck sends him, without undertaking assiduous
searches.It is essential, therefore, that the equilibrium of a prize
perched on the top of a stalk and only just held in position by a touch
of glue should be disturbed as little as possible during the onslaught;
it is necessary that the assailant should go to work with infinite
circumspection and without producing pain, lest any muscular reaction
should provoke a fall and endanger the prize.As we see, sudden and
profound anaesthesia is an excellent means of enabling the Lampyris to
attain his object, which is to consume his prey in perfect quiet.Does he really eat, that is to say,
does he divide his food piecemeal, does he carve it into minute
particles, which are afterwards ground by a chewing-apparatus?I never see a trace of solid nourishment on my captives' mouths.The Glow-worm does not eat in the strict sense of the word: he drinks
his fill; he feeds on a thin gruel into which he transforms his prey by
a method recalling that of the maggot.Like the flesh-eating grub of
the Fly, he too is able to digest before consuming; he liquefies his
prey before feeding on it.This is how things happen: a Snail has been rendered insensible by the
Glow-worm.The operator is nearly always alone, even when the prize is
a large one, like the common Snail, Helix aspersa.Soon a number of
guests hasten up--two, three, or more--and, without any quarrel with
the real proprietor, all alike fall to.Let us leave them to themselves
for a couple of days and then turn the shell, with the opening
downwards.The contents flow out as easily as would soup from an
overturned saucepan.When the sated diners retire from this gruel, only
insignificant leavings remain.By repeated tiny bites, similar to the tweaks
which we saw distributed at the outset, the flesh of the Mollusc is
converted into a gruel on which the various banqueters nourish
themselves without distinction, each working at the broth by means of
some special pepsine and each taking his own mouthfuls of it.In
consequence of this method, which first converts the food into a
liquid, the Glow-worm's mouth must be very feebly armed apart from the
two fangs which sting the patient and inject the anaesthetic poison and
at the same time, no doubt, the serum capable of turning the solid
flesh into fluid.Those two tiny implements, which can just be examined
through the lens, must, it seems, have some other object.They are
hollow, and in this resemble those of the Ant-lion, who sucks and
drains her capture without having to divide it; but there is this great
difference, that the Ant-lion leaves copious remnants, which are
afterwards flung outside the funnel-shaped trap dug in the sand,
whereas the Glow-worm, that expert liquifier, leaves nothing, or next
to nothing.With similar tools, the one simply sucks the blood of his
prey and the other turns every morsel of his to account, thanks to a
preliminary liquefaction.And this is done with exquisite precision, though the equilibrium is
sometimes anything but steady.My rearing-glasses supply me with
magnificent examples.Crawling up the sides, the Snails imprisoned in
my apparatus sometimes reach the top, which is closed with a glass
pane, and fix themselves to it with a speck of glair.This is a mere
temporary halt, in which the Mollusc is miserly with his adhesive
product, and the merest shake is enough to loosen the shell and send it
to the bottom of the jar.Now it is not unusual for the Glow-worm to hoist himself up there, with
the help of a certain climbing-organ that makes up for his weak legs.He selects his quarry, makes a minute inspection of it to find an
entrance-slit, nibbles at it a little, renders it insensible and,
without delay, proceeds to prepare the gruel which he will consume for
days on end.When he leaves the table, the shell is found to be absolutely empty;
and yet this shell, which was fixed to the glass by a very faint
stickiness, has not come loose, has not even shifted its position in
the smallest degree: without any protest from the hermit gradually
converted into broth, it has been drained on the very spot at which the
first attack was delivered.These small details tell us how promptly
the anaesthetic bite takes effect; they teach us how dexterously the
Glow-worm treats his Snail without causing him to fall from a very
slippery, vertical support and without even shaking him on his slight
line of adhesion.Under these conditions of equilibrium, the operator's short, clumsy
legs are obviously not enough; a special accessory apparatus is needed
to defy the danger of slipping and to seize the unseizable.And this
apparatus the Lampyris possesses.At the hinder end of the animal we
see a white spot which the lens separates into some dozen short, fleshy
appendages, sometimes gathered into a cluster, sometimes spread into a
rosette.There is your organ of adhesion and locomotion.If he would
fix himself somewhere, even on a very smooth surface, such as a
grass-stalk, the Glow-worm opens his rosette and spreads it wide on the
support, to which it adheres by its own stickiness.The same organ,
rising and falling, opening and closing, does much to assist the act of
progression.In short, the Glow-worm is a new sort of self-propelled
<DW36>, who decks his hind-quarters with a dainty white rose, a kind
of hand with twelve fingers, not jointed, but moving in every
direction: tubular fingers which do not seize, but stick.The same organ serves another purpose: that of a toilet-sponge and
brush.At a moment of rest, after a meal, the Glow-worm passes and
repasses the said brush over his head, back, sides and hinder parts, a
performance made possible by the flexibility of his spine.This is done
point by point, from one end of the body to the other, with a
scrupulous persistency that proves the great interest which he takes in
the operation.What is his object in thus sponging himself, in dusting
and polishing himself so carefully?It is a question, apparently, of
removing a few atoms of dust or else some traces of viscidity that
remain from the evil contact with the Snail.A wash and brush-up is not
superfluous when one leaves the tub in which the Mollusc has been
treated.If the Glow-worm possessed no other talent than that of chloroforming
his prey by means of a few tweaks resembling kisses, he would be
unknown to the vulgar herd; but he also knows how to light himself like
a beacon; he shines, which is an excellent manner of achieving fame.Let us consider more particularly the female, who, while retaining her
larval shape, becomes marriageable and glows at her best during the
hottest part of summer.The lighting-apparatus occupies the last three
segments of the abdomen.On each of the first two it takes the form, on
the ventral surface, of a wide belt covering almost the whole of the
arch; on the third the luminous part is much less and consists simply
of two small crescent-shaped markings, or rather two spots which shine
through to the back and are visible both above and below the animal.Belts and spots emit a glorious white light, delicately tinged with
blue.The general lighting of the Glow-worm thus comprises two groups:
first, the wide belts of the two segments preceding the last; secondly,
the two spots of the final segments.The two belts, the exclusive
attribute of the marriageable female, are the parts richest in light:
to glorify her wedding, the future mother dons her brightest gauds; she
lights her two resplendent scarves.But, before that, from the time of
the hatching, she had only the modest rush-light of the stern.This
efflorescence of light is the equivalent of the final metamorphosis,
which is usually represented by the gift of wings and flight.Its
brilliance heralds the pairing-time.Wings and flight there will be
none: the female retains her humble larval form, but she kindles her
blazing beacon.The male, on his side, is fully transformed, changes his shape,
acquires wings and wing-cases; nevertheless, like the female, he
possesses, from the time when he is hatched, the pale lamp of the end
segment.This luminous aspect of the stern is characteristic of the
entire Glow-worm tribe, independently of sex and season.It appears
upon the budding grub and continues throughout life unchanged.And we
must not forget to add that it is visible on the dorsal as well as on
the ventral surface, whereas the two large belts peculiar to the female
shine only under the abdomen.My hand is not so steady nor my sight so good as once they were; but,
as far as they allow me, I consult anatomy for the structure of the
luminous organs.I take a scrap of the epidermis and manage to separate
pretty nearly half of one of the shining belts.On the skin a sort of white-wash lies spread,
formed of a very fine, granular substance.This is certainly the
light-producing matter.To examine this white layer more closely is
beyond the power of my weary eyes.Just beside it is a curious
air-tube, whose short and remarkably wide stem branches suddenly into a
sort of bushy tuft of very delicate ramifications.These creep over the
luminous sheet, or even dip into it.The luminescence, therefore, is controlled by the respiratory organs
and the work produced is an oxidation.The white sheet supplies the
oxidizable matter and the thick air-tube spreading into a tufty bush
distributes the flow of air over it.There remains the question of the
substance whereof this sheet is formed.The first suggestion was
phosphorus, in the chemist's sense of the word.The Glow-worm was
calcined and treated with the violent reagents that bring the simple
substances to light; but no one, so far as I know, has obtained a
satisfactory answer along these lines.Phosphorus seems to play no part
here, in spite of the name of phosphorescence which is sometimes
bestowed upon the Glow-worm's gleam.The answer lies elsewhere, no one
knows where.We are better-informed as regards another question.Has the Glow-worm a
free control of the light which he emits?Can he turn it on or down or
put it out as he pleases?Has he an opaque screen which is drawn over
the flame at will, or is that flame always left exposed?There is no
need for any such mechanism: the insect has something better for its
revolving light.The thick air-tube supplying the light-producing sheet increases the
flow of air and the light is intensified; the same tube, swayed by the
animal's will, slackens or even suspends the passage of air and the
light grows fainter or even goes out.It is, in short, the mechanism of
a lamp which is regulated by the access of air to the wick.Excitement can set the attendant air-duct in motion.We must here
distinguish between two cases: that of the gorgeous scarves, the
exclusive ornament of the female ripe for matrimony, and that of the
modest fairy-lamp on the last segment, which both sexes kindle at any
age.In the second case, the extinction caused by a flurry is sudden
and complete, or nearly so.In my nocturnal hunts for young Glow-worms,
measuring about 5 millimetres long (.195 inch.--Translator's Note.), I
can plainly see the glimmer on the blades of grass; but, should the
least false step disturb a neighbouring twig, the light goes out at
once and the coveted insect becomes invisible.Upon the full-grown
females, lit up with their nuptial scarves, even a violent start has
but a slight effect and often none at all.I fire a gun beside a wire-gauze cage in which I am rearing my
menagerie of females in the open air.The illumination continues, as bright and placid as before.I take a
spray and rain down a slight shower of cold water upon the flock.Not
one of my animals puts out its light; at the very most, there is a
brief pause in the radiance; and then only in some cases.I send a puff
of smoke from my pipe into the cage.There are even some extinctions, but these do not last long.Calm soon returns and the light is renewed as brightly as ever.I take
some of the captives in my fingers, turn and return them, tease them a
little.The illumination continues and is not much diminished, if I do
not press hard with my thumb.At this period, with the pairing close at
hand, the insect is in all the fervour of its passionate splendour, and
nothing short of very serious reasons would make it put out its signals
altogether.All things considered, there is not a doubt but that the Glow-worm
himself manages his lighting apparatus, extinguishing and rekindling it
at will; but there is one point at which the voluntary agency of the
insect is without effect.I detach a strip of the epidermis showing one
of the luminescent sheets and place it in a glass tube, which I close
with a plug of damp wadding, to avoid an over-rapid evaporation.Well,
this scrap of carcass shines away merrily, although not quite as
brilliantly as on the living body.The oxidizable substance, the
luminescent sheet, is in direct communication with the surrounding
atmosphere; the flow of oxygen through an air-tube is not necessary;
and the luminous emission continues to take place, in the same way as
when it is produced by the contact of the air with the real phosphorus
of the chemists.Let us add that, in aerated water, the luminousness
continues as brilliant as in the free air, but that it is extinguished
in water deprived of its air by boiling.No better proof could be found
of what I have already propounded, namely, that the Glow-worm's light
is the effect of a slow oxidation.The light is white, calm and soft to the eyes and suggests a spark
dropped by the full moon.Despite its splendour, it is a very feeble
illuminant.If we move a Glow-worm along a line of print, in perfect
darkness, we can easily make out the letters, one by one, and even
words, when these are not too long; but nothing more is visible beyond
a narrow zone.A lantern of this kind soon tires the reader's patience.Suppose a group of Glow-worms placed almost touching one another.Each
of them sheds its glimmer, which ought, one would think, to light up
its neighbours by reflexion and give us a clear view of each individual
specimen.But not at all: the luminous party is a chaos in which our
eyes are unable to distinguish any definite form at a medium distance.The collective lights confuse the light-bearers into one vague whole.Photography gives us a striking proof of this.I have a score of
females, all at the height of their splendour, in a wire-gauze cage in
the open air.A tuft of thyme forms a grove in the centre of their
establishment.When night comes, my captives clamber to this pinnacle
and strive to show off their luminous charms to the best advantage at
every point of the horizon, thus forming along the twigs marvellous
clusters from which I expected magnificent effects on the
photographer's plates and paper.All that I
obtain is white, shapeless patches, denser here and less dense there
according to the numbers forming the group.There is no picture of the
Glow-worms themselves; not a trace either of the tuft of thyme.For
want of satisfactory light, the glorious firework is represented by a
blurred splash of white on a black ground.The beacons of the female Glow-worms are evidently nuptial signals,
invitations to the pairing; but observe that they are lighted on the
lower surface of the abdomen and face the ground, whereas the summoned
males, whose flights are sudden and uncertain, travel overhead, in the
air, sometimes a great way up.In its normal position, therefore, the
glittering lure is concealed from the eyes of those concerned; it is
covered by the thick bulk of the bride.The lantern ought really to
gleam on the back and not under the belly; otherwise the light is
hidden under a bushel.The anomaly is corrected in a very ingenious fashion, for every female
has her little wiles of coquetry.At nightfall, every evening, my caged
captives make for the tuft of thyme with which I have thoughtfully
furnished the prison and climb to the top of the upper branches, those
most in sight.Here, instead of keeping quiet, as they did at the foot
of the bush just now, they indulge in violent exercises, twist the tip
of their very flexible abdomen, turn it to one side, turn it to the
other, jerk it in every direction.In this way, the searchlight cannot
fail to gleam, at one moment or another, before the eyes of every male
who goes a-wooing in the neighbourhood, whether on the ground or in the
air.It is very like the working of the revolving mirror used in catching
Larks.If stationary, the little contrivance would leave the bird
indifferent; turning and breaking up its light in rapid flashes, it
excites it.While the female Glow-worm has her tricks for summoning her swains, the
male, on his side, is provided with an optical apparatus suited to
catch from afar the least reflection of the calling signal.His
corselet expands into a shield and overlaps his head considerably in
the form of a peaked cap or a shade, the object of which appears to be
to limit the field of vision and concentrate the view upon the luminous
speck to be discerned.Under this arch are the two eyes, which are
relatively enormous, exceedingly convex, shaped like a skull-cap and
contiguous to the extent of leaving only a narrow groove for the
insertion of the antennae.This double eye, occupying almost the whole
face of the insect and contained in the cavern formed by the spreading
peak of the corselet, is a regular Cyclops' eye.At the moment of the pairing the illumination becomes much fainter, is
almost extinguished; all that remains alight is the humble fairy-lamp
of the last segment.This discreet night-light is enough for the
wedding, while, all around, the host of nocturnal insects, lingering
over their respective affairs, murmur the universal marriage-hymn.The round, white eggs are laid, or rather
strewn at random, without the least care on the mother's part, either
on the more or less cool earth or on a blade of grass.These brilliant
ones know nothing at all of family affection.Here is a very singular thing: the Glow-worm's eggs are luminous even
when still contained in the mother's womb.If I happen by accident to
crush a female big with germs that have reached maturity, a shiny
streak runs along my fingers, as though I had broken some vessel filled
with a phosphorescent fluid.The
luminosity comes from the cluster of eggs forced out of the ovary.Besides, as laying-time approaches, the phosphorescence of the eggs is
already made manifest through this clumsy midwifery.A soft opalescent
light shines through the integument of the belly.The young of either sex
have two little rush-lights on the last segment.At the approach of the
severe weather they go down into the ground, but not very far.In my
rearing-jars, which are supplied with fine and very loose earth, they
descend to a depth of three or four inches at most.I dig up a few in
mid-winter.I always find them carrying their faint stern-light.About
the month of April they come up again to the surface, there to continue
and complete their evolution.From start to finish the Glow-worm's life is one great orgy of light.The eggs are luminous; the grubs likewise.The full-grown females are
magnificent lighthouses, the adult males retain the glimmer which the
grubs already possessed.We can understand the object of the feminine
beacon; but of what use is all the rest of the pyrotechnic display?To
my great regret, I cannot tell.It is and will be, for many a day to
come, perhaps for all time, the secret of animal physics, which is
deeper than the physics of the books.THE CABBAGE-CATERPILLAR.The cabbage of our modern kitchen-gardens is a semi-artificial plant,
the produce of our agricultural ingenuity quite as much as of the
niggardly gifts of nature.Spontaneous vegetation supplied us with the
long-stalked, scanty-leaved, ill-smelling wilding, as found, according
to the botanists, on the ocean cliffs.He had need of a rare
inspiration who first showed faith in this rustic clown and proposed to
improve it in his garden-patch.Progressing by infinitesimal degrees, culture wrought miracles.It
began by persuading the wild cabbage to discard its wretched leaves,
beaten by the sea-winds, and to replace them by others, ample and
fleshy and close-fitting.It deprived itself of the joys of light by arranging its leaves in a
large compact head, white and tender.In our day, among the successors
of those first tiny hearts, are some that, by virtue of their massive
bulk, have earned the glorious name of chou quintal, as who should say
a hundredweight of cabbage.Later, man thought of obtaining a generous dish with a thousand little
sprays of the inflorescence.Under the cover of
the central leaves, it gorged with food its sheaves of blossom, its
flower-stalks, its branches and worked the lot into a fleshy
conglomeration.Differently entreated, the plant, economizing in the centre of its
shoot, set a whole family of close-wrapped cabbages ladder-wise on a
tall stem.A multitude of dwarf leaf-buds took the place of the
colossal head.Next comes the turn of the stump, an unprofitable, almost wooden,
thing, which seemed never to have any other purpose than to act as a
support for the plant.But the tricks of gardeners are capable of
everything, so much so that the stalk yields to the grower's
suggestions and becomes fleshy and swells into an ellipse similar to
the turnip, of which it possesses all the merits of corpulence, flavour
and delicacy; only the strange product serves as a base for a few
sparse leaves, the last protests of a real stem that refuses to lose
its attributes entirely.If the stem allows itself to be allured, why not the root?It does, in
fact, yield to the blandishments of agriculture: it dilates its pivot
into a flat turnip, which half emerges from the ground.This is the
rutabaga, or swede, the turnip-cabbage of our northern districts.Incomparably docile under our nursing, the cabbage has given its all
for our nourishment and that of our cattle: its leaves, its flowers,
its buds, its stalk, its root; all that it now wants is to combine the
ornamental with the useful, to smarten itself, to adorn our flowerbeds
and cut a good figure on a drawing-room table.It has done this to
perfection, not with its flowers, which, in their modesty, continue
intractable, but with its curly and variegated leaves, which have the
undulating grace of Ostrich-feathers and the rich colouring of a mixed
bouquet.None who beholds it in this magnificence will recognize the
near relation of the vulgar "greens" that form the basis of our
cabbage-soup.The cabbage, first in order of date in our kitchen-gardens, was held in
high esteem by classic antiquity, next after the bean and, later, the
pea; but it goes much farther back, so far indeed that no memories of
its acquisition remain.History pays but little attention to these
details: it celebrates the battle-fields whereon we meet our death, but
scorns to speak of the ploughed fields whereby we thrive; it knows the
names of the kings' bastards, but cannot tell us the origin of wheat.This silence respecting the precious plants that serve as food is most
regrettable.The cabbage in particular, the venerable cabbage, that
denizen of the most ancient garden-plots, would have had extremely
interesting things to teach us.It is a treasure in itself, but a
treasure twice exploited, first by man and next by the caterpillar of
the Pieris, the common Large White Butterfly whom we all know (Pieris
brassicae, Lin.).This caterpillar feeds indiscriminately on the leaves
of all varieties of cabbage, however dissimilar in appearance: he
nibbles with the same appetite red cabbage and broccoli, curly greens
and savoy, swedes and turnip-tops, in short, all that our ingenuity,
lavish of time and patience, has been able to obtain from the original
plant since the most distant ages.But what did the caterpillar eat before our cabbages supplied him with
copious provender?Obviously the Pieris did not wait for the advent of
man and his horticultural works in order to take part in the joys of
life.She lived without us and would have continued to live without us.A Butterfly's existence is not subject to ours, but rightfully
independent of our aid.Before the white-heart, the cauliflower, the savoy and the others were
invented, the Pieris' caterpillar certainly did not lack food: he
browsed on the wild cabbage of the cliffs, the parent of all the
latter-day wealth; but, as this plant is not widely distributed and is,
in any case, limited to certain maritime regions, the welfare of the
Butterfly, whether on plain or hill, demanded a more luxuriant and more
common plant for pasturage.This plant was apparently one of the
Cruciferae, more or less seasoned with sulpheretted essence, like the
cabbages.I rear the Pieris' caterpillars from the egg upwards on the wall-rocket
(Diplotaxis tenuifolia, Dec.), which imbibes strong spices along the
edge of the paths and at the foot of the walls.Penned in a large
wire-gauze bell-cage, they accept this provender without demur; they
nibble it with the same appetite as if it were cabbage; and they end by
producing chrysalids and Butterflies.The change of fare causes not the
least trouble.I am equally successful with other crucifers of a less marked flavour:
white mustard (Sinapis incana, Lin.), dyer's woad (Isatis tinctoria,
Lin.), wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum, Lin.), whitlow pepperwort
(Lepidium draba, Lin.), hedge-mustard (Sisymbrium officinale, Scop.).On the other hand, the leaves of the lettuce, the bean, the pea, the
corn-salad are obstinately refused.Let us be content with what we have
seen: the fare has been sufficiently varied to show us that the
cabbage-caterpillar feeds exclusively on a large number of crucifers,
perhaps even on all.As these experiments are made in the enclosure of a bell-cage, one
might imagine that captivity impels the flock to feed, in the absence
of better things, on what it would refuse were it free to hunt for
itself.Having naught else within their reach, the starvelings consume
any and all Cruciferae, without distinction of species.Can things
sometimes be the same in the open fields, where I play none of my
tricks?Can the family of the White Butterfly be settled on other
Crucifers than the cabbage?I start a quest along the paths near the
gardens and end by finding on wild radish and white mustard colonies as
crowded and prosperous as those established on cabbage.Now, except when the metamorphosis is at hand, the caterpillar of the
White Butterfly never travels: he does all his growing on the identical
plant whereon he saw the light.The caterpillars observed on the wild
radish, as well as other households, are not, therefore, emigrants who
have come as a matter of fancy from some cabbage-patch in the
neighbourhood: they have hatched on the very leaves where I find them.Hence I arrive at this conclusion: the White Butterfly, who is fitful
in her flight, chooses cabbage first, to dab her eggs upon, and
different Cruciferae next, varying greatly in appearance.How does the Pieris manage to know her way about her botanical domain?We have seen the Larini (A species of Weevils found on
thistle-heads.--Translator's Note.), those explorers of fleshy
receptacles with an artichoke flavour, astonish us with their knowledge
of the flora of the thistle tribe; but their lore might, at a pinch, be
explained by the method followed at the moment of housing the egg.With
their rostrum, they prepare niches and dig out basins in the receptacle
exploited and consequently they taste the thing a little before
entrusting their eggs to it.On the other hand, the Butterfly, a
nectar-drinker, makes not the least enquiry into the savoury qualities
of the leafage; at most dipping her proboscis into the flowers, she
abstracts a mouthful of syrup.This means of investigation, moreover,
would be of no use to her, for the plant selected for the establishing
of her family is, for the most part, not yet in flower.The mother
flits for a moment around the plant; and that swift examination is
enough: the emission of eggs takes place if the provender be found
suitable.The botanist, to recognize a crucifer, requires the indication provided
by the flower.She does not consult the
seed-vessel, to see if it be long or short, nor yet the petals, four in
number and arranged in a cross, because the plant, as a rule, is not in
flower; and still she recognizes offhand what suits her caterpillars,
in spite of profound differences that would embarrass any but a
botanical expert.Unless the Pieris has an innate power of discrimination to guide her,
it is impossible to understand the great extent of her vegetable realm.She needs for her family Cruciferae, nothing but Cruciferae; and she
knows this group of plants to perfection.I have been an enthusiastic
botanist for half a century and more.Nevertheless, to discover if this
or that plant, new to me, is or is not one of the Cruciferae, in the
absence of flowers and fruits I should have more faith in the
Butterfly's statements than in all the learned records of the books.Where science is apt to make mistakes instinct is infallible.The Pieris has two families a year: one in April and May, the other in
September.The cabbage-patches are renewed in those same months.The
Butterfly's calendar tallies with the gardener's: the moment that
provisions are in sight, consumers are forthcoming for the feast.The eggs are a bright orange-yellow and do not lack prettiness when
examined under the lens.They are blunted cones, ranged side by side on
their round base and adorned with finely-scored longitudinal ridges.They are collected in slabs, sometimes on the upper surface, when the
leaf that serves as a support is spread wide, sometimes on the lower
surface when the leaf is pressed to the next ones.Slabs of a couple of hundred are pretty frequent;
isolated eggs, or eggs collected in small groups, are, on the contrary,
rare.The mother's output is affected by the degree of quietness at the
moment of laying.The outer circumference of the group is irregularly formed, but the
inside presents a certain order.The eggs are here arranged in straight
rows backing against one another in such a way that each egg finds a
double support in the preceding row.This alternation, without being of
an irreproachable precision, gives a fairly stable equilibrium to the
whole.To see the mother at her laying is no easy matter: when examined too
closely, the Pieris decamps at once.The structure of the work,
however, reveals the order of the operations pretty clearly.The
ovipositor swings slowly first in this direction, then in that, by
turns; and a new egg is lodged in each space between two adjoining eggs
in the previous row.The extent of the oscillation determines the
length of the row, which is longer or shorter according to the layer's
fancy.The hatching takes place in about a week.It is almost simultaneous for
the whole mass: as soon as one caterpillar comes out of its egg, the
others come out also, as though the natal impulse were communicated
from one to the other.In the same way, in the nest of the Praying
Mantis, a warning seems to be spread abroad, arousing every one of the
population.It is a wave propagated in all directions from the point
first struck.The egg does not open by means of a dehiscence similar to that of the
vegetable-pods whose seeds have attained maturity; it is the new-born
grub itself that contrives an exit-way by gnawing a hole in its
enclosure.In this manner, it obtains near the top of the cone a
symmetrical dormer-window, clean-edged, with no joins nor unevenness of
any kind, showing that this part of the wall has been nibbled away and
swallowed.But for this breach, which is just wide enough for the
deliverance, the egg remains intact, standing firmly on its base.It is
now that the lens is best able to take in its elegant structure.What
it sees is a bag made of ultra-fine gold-beater's skin, translucent,
stiff and white, retaining the complete form of the original egg.A
score of streaked and knotted lines run from the top to the base.It is
the wizard's pointed cap, the mitre with the grooves carved into
jewelled chaplets.All said, the Cabbage-caterpillar's birth-casket is
an exquisite work of art.The hatching of the lot is finished in a couple of hours and the
swarming family musters on the layer of swaddling-clothes, still in the
same position.For a long time, before descending to the fostering
leaf, it lingers on this kind of hot-bed, is even very busy there.It is browsing a strange kind of grass, the handsome mitres
that remain standing on end.Slowly and methodically, from top to base,
the new-born grubs nibble the wallets whence they have just emerged.By
to-morrow, nothing is left of these but a pattern of round dots, the
bases of the vanished sacks.As his first mouthfuls, therefore, the Cabbage-caterpillar eats the
membranous wrapper of his egg.This is a regulation diet, for I have
never seen one of the little grubs allow itself to be tempted by the
adjacent green stuff before finishing the ritual repast whereat skin
bottles furnish forth the feast.It is the first time that I have seen
a larva make a meal of the sack in which it was born.Of what use can
this singular fare be to the budding caterpillar?I suspect as follows:
the leaves of the cabbage are waxed and slippery surfaces and nearly
always slant considerably.To graze on them without risking a fall,
which would be fatal in earliest childhood, is hardly possible unless
with moorings that afford a steady support.What is needed is bits of
silk stretched along the road as fast as progress is made, something
for the legs to grip, something to provide a good anchorage even when
the grub is upside down.The silk-tubes, where those moorings are
manufactured, must be very scantily supplied in a tiny, new-born
animal; and it is expedient that they be filled without delay with the
aid of a special form of nourishment.Then what shall the nature of the
first food be?Vegetable matter, slow to elaborate and niggardly in its
yield, does not fulfil the desired conditions at all well, for time
presses and we must trust ourselves safely to the slippery leaf.An
animal diet would be preferable: it is easier to digest and undergoes
chemical changes in a shorter time.The wrapper of the egg is of a
horny nature, as silk itself is.It will not take long to transform the
one into the other.The grub therefore tackles the remains of its egg
and turns it into silk to carry with it on its first journeys.If my surmise is well-founded, there is reason to believe that, with a
view to speedily filling the silk-glands to which they look to supply
them with ropes, other caterpillars beginning their existence on smooth
and steeply-slanting leaves also take as their first mouthful the
membranous sack which is all that remains of the egg.The whole of the platform of birth-sacks which was the first
camping-ground of the White Butterfly's family is razed to the ground;
naught remains but the round marks of the individual pieces that
composed it.The structure of piles has disappeared; the prints left by
the piles remain.The little caterpillars are now on the level of the
leaf which shall henceforth feed them.They are a pale orange-yellow,
with a sprinkling of white bristles.The head is a shiny black and
remarkably powerful; it already gives signs of the coming gluttony.The
little animal measures scarcely two millimetres in length.(.078
inch.--Translator's Note.)The troop begins its steadying-work as soon as it comes into contact
with its pasturage, the green cabbage-leaf.Here, there, in its
immediate neighbourhood, each grub emits from its spinning glands short
cables so slender that it takes an attentive lens to catch a glimpse of
them.This is enough to ensure the equilibrium of the almost
imponderable atom.The grub's length promptly increases
from two millimetres to four.Soon, a moult takes place which alters
its costume: its skin becomes speckled, on a pale-yellow ground, with a
number of black dots intermingled with white bristles.Three or four
days of rest are necessary after the fatigue of breaking cover.When
this is over, the hunger-fit starts that will make a ruin of the
cabbage within a few weeks.What a stomach, working continuously day and night!It is a devouring laboratory, through which the foodstuffs merely pass,
transformed at once.I serve up to my caged herd a bunch of leaves
picked from among the biggest: two hours later, nothing remains but the
thick midribs; and even these are attacked when there is any delay in
renewing the victuals.At this rate a "hundredweight-cabbage," doled
out leaf by leaf, would not last my menagerie a week.The gluttonous animal, therefore, when it swarms and multiplies, is a
scourge.How are we to protect our gardens against it?In the days of
Pliny, the great Latin naturalist, a stake was set up in the middle of
the cabbage-bed to be preserved; and on this stake was fixed a Horse's
skull bleached in the sun: a Mare's skull was considered even better.This sort of bogey was supposed to ward off the devouring brood.My confidence in this preservative is but an indifferent one; my reason
for mentioning it is that it reminds me of a custom still observed in
our own days, at least in my part of the country.Nothing is so
long-lived as absurdity.Tradition has retained in a simplified form,
the ancient defensive apparatus of which Pliny speaks.For the Horse's
skull our people have substituted an egg-shell on the top of a switch
stuck among the cabbages.It is easier to arrange; also it is quite as
useful, that is to say, it has no effect whatever.Everything, even the nonsensical, is capable of explanation with a
little credulity.When I question the peasants, our neighbours, they
tell me that the effect of the egg-shell is as simple as can be: the
Butterflies, attracted by the whiteness, come and lay their eggs upon
it.Broiled by the sun and lacking all nourishment on that thankless
support, the little caterpillars die; and that makes so many fewer.I insist; I ask them if they have ever seen slabs of eggs or masses of
young caterpillars on those white shells."Never," they reply, with one voice."It was done in the old days and so we go on doing it: that's all we
know; and that's enough for us."I leave it at that, persuaded that the memory of the Horse's skull,
used once upon a time, is ineradicable, like all the rustic absurdities
implanted by the ages.We have, when all is said, but one means of protection, which is to
watch and inspect the cabbage-leaves assiduously and crush the slabs of
eggs between our finger and thumb and the caterpillars with our feet.Nothing is so effective as this method, which makes great demands on
one's time and vigilance.What pains to obtain an unspoilt cabbage!And
what a debt do we not owe to those humble scrapers of the soil, those
ragged heroes, who provide us with the wherewithal to live!To eat and digest, to accumulate reserves whence the Butterfly will
issue: that is the caterpillar's one and only business.The
Cabbage-caterpillar performs it with insatiable gluttony.Incessantly
it browses, incessantly digests: the supreme felicity of an animal
which is little more than an intestine.There is never a distraction,
unless it be certain see-saw movements which are particularly curious
when several caterpillars are grazing side by side, abreast.Then, at
intervals, all the heads in the row are briskly lifted and as briskly
lowered, time after time, with an automatic precision worthy of a
Prussian drill-ground.Can it be their method of intimidating an always
possible aggressor?Can it be a manifestation of gaiety, when the
wanton sun warms their full paunches?Whether sign of fear or sign of
bliss, this is the only exercise that the gluttons allow themselves
until the proper degree of plumpness is attained.After a month's grazing, the voracious appetite of my caged herd is
assuaged.The caterpillars climb the trelliswork in every direction,
walk about anyhow, with their forepart raised and searching space.Here
and there, as they pass, the swaying herd put forth a thread.They
wander restlessly, anxiously to travel afar.The exodus now prevented
by the trellised enclosure I once saw under excellent conditions.At
the advent of the cold weather, I had placed a few cabbage-stalks,
covered with caterpillars, in a small greenhouse.Those who saw the
common kitchen vegetable sumptuously lodged under glass, in the company
of the pelargonium and the Chinese primrose, were astonished at my
curious fancy.I had my plans: I wanted to find out
how the family of the Large White Butterfly behaves when the cold
weather sets in.At the end of
November, the caterpillars, having grown to the desired extent, left
the cabbages, one by one, and began to roam about the walls.None of
them fixed himself there or made preparations for the transformation.I
suspected that they wanted the choice of a spot in the open air,
exposed to all the rigours of winter.I therefore left the door of the
hothouse open.I found them dispersed all over the neighbouring walls, some thirty
yards off.The thrust of a ledge, the eaves formed by a projecting bit
of mortar served them as a shelter where the chrysalid moult took place
and where the winter was passed.The Cabbage-caterpillar possesses a
robust constitution, unsusceptible to torrid heat or icy cold.All that
he needs for his metamorphosis is an airy lodging, free from permanent
damp.The inmates of my fold, therefore, move about for a few days on the
trelliswork, anxious to travel afar in search of a wall.Finding none
and realizing that time presses, they resign themselves.Each one,
supporting himself on the trellis, first weaves around himself a thin
carpet of white silk, which will form the sustaining layer at the time
of the laborious and delicate work of the nymphosis.He fixes his
rear-end to this base by a silk pad and his fore-part by a strap that
passes under his shoulders and is fixed on either side to the carpet.Thus slung from his three fastenings, he strips himself of his larval
apparel and turns into a chrysalis in the open air, with no protection
save that of the wall, which the caterpillar would certainly have found
had I not interfered.Of a surety, he would be short-sighted indeed that pictured a world of
good things prepared exclusively for our advantage.The earth, the
great foster-mother, has a generous breast.At the very moment when
nourishing matter is created, even though it be with our own zealous
aid, she summons to the feast host upon host of consumers, who are all
the more numerous and enterprising in proportion as the table is more
amply spread.The cherry of our orchards is excellent eating: a maggot
contends with us for its possession.In vain do we weigh suns and
planets: our supremacy, which fathoms the universe, cannot prevent a
wretched worm from levying its toll on the delicious fruit.We make
ourselves at home in a cabbage bed: the sons of the Pieris make
themselves at home there too.Preferring broccoli to wild radish, they
profit where we have profited; and we have no remedy against their
competition save caterpillar-raids and egg-crushing, a thankless,
tedious, and none too efficacious work.The Cabbage-caterpillar eagerly
puts forth his own, so much so that the cultivation of the precious
plant would be endangered if others concerned did not take part in its
defence.These others are the auxiliaries (The author employs this word
to denote the insects that are helpful, while describing as "ravagers"
the insects that are hurtful to the farmer's crops.--Translator's
Note.), our helpers from necessity and not from sympathy.The words
friend and foe, auxiliaries and ravagers are here the mere conventions
of a language not always adapted to render the exact truth.He is our
foe who eats or attacks our crops; our friend is he who feeds upon our
foes.Everything is reduced to a frenzied contest of appetites.In the name of the might that is mine, of trickery, of highway robbery,
clear out of that, you, and make room for me: give me your seat at the
banquet!That is the inexorable law in the world of animals and more or
less, alas, in our own world as well!Now, among our entomological auxiliaries, the smallest in size are the
best at their work.One of them is charged with watching over the
cabbages.She is so small, she works so discreetly that the gardener
does not know her, has not even heard of her.Were he to see her by
accident, flitting around the plant which she protects, he would take
no notice of her, would not suspect the service rendered.I propose to
set forth the tiny <DW40>'s deserts.Scientists call her Microgaster glomeratus.What exactly was in the
mind of the author of the name Microgaster, which means little belly?Did he intend to allude to the insignificance of the abdomen?However slight the belly may be, the insect nevertheless possesses one,
correctly proportioned to the rest of the body, so that the classic
denomination, far from giving us any information, might mislead us,
were we to trust it wholly.Nomenclature, which changes from day to day
and becomes more and more cacophonous, is an unsafe guide.Instead of
asking the animal what its name is, let us begin by asking:

"What can you do?Well, the Microgaster's business is to exploit the Cabbage-caterpillar,
a clearly-defined business, admitting of no possible confusion.In the spring, let us inspect the neighbourhood of
the kitchen-garden.Be our eye never so unobservant, we shall notice
against the walls or on the withered grasses at the foot of the hedges
some very small yellow cocoons, heaped into masses the size of a
hazel-nut.Beside each group lies a Cabbage-caterpillar, sometimes dying,
sometimes dead, and always presenting a most tattered appearance.These
cocoons are the work of the Microgaster's family, hatched or on the
point of hatching into the perfect stage; the caterpillar is the dish
whereon that family has fed during its larval state.The epithet
glomeratus, which accompanies the name of Microgaster, suggests this
conglomeration of cocoons.Let us collect the clusters as they are,
without seeking to separate them, an operation which would demand both
patience and dexterity, for the cocoons are closely united by the
inextricable tangle of their surface-threads.In May a swarm of pigmies
will sally forth, ready to get to business in the cabbages.Colloquial language uses the terms Midge and Gnat to describe the tiny
insects which we often see dancing in a ray of sunlight.There is
something of everything in those aerial ballets.It is possible that
the persecutrix of the Cabbage-caterpillar is there, along with many
another; but the name of Midge cannot properly be applied to her.He
who says Midge says Fly, Dipteron, two-winged insect; and our friend
has four wings, one and all adapted for flying.By virtue of this
characteristic and others no less important, she belongs to the order
of Hymenoptera.(This order includes the Ichneumon-flies, of whom the
Microgaster is one.--Translator's Note.)No matter: as our language
possesses no more precise term outside the scientific vocabulary, let
us use the expression Midge, which pretty well conveys the general
idea.Our Midge, the Microgaster, is the size of an average Gnat.She
measures 3 or 4 millimetres.(.117 to.156 inch.--Translator's Note.)The two sexes are equally numerous and wear the same costume, a black
uniform, all but the legs, which are pale red.In spite of this
likeness, they are easily distinguished.The male has an abdomen which
is slightly flattened and, moreover, curved at the tip; the female,
before the laying, has hers full and perceptibly distended by its
ovular contents.This rapid sketch of the insect should be enough for
our purpose.If we wish to know the grub and especially to inform ourselves of its
manner of living, it is advisable to rear in a cage a numerous herd of
Cabbage-caterpillars.Whereas a direct search on the cabbages in our
garden would give us but a difficult and uncertain harvest, by this
means we shall daily have as many as we wish before our eyes.In the course of June, which is the time when the caterpillars quit
their pastures and go far afield to settle on some wall or other, those
in my fold, finding nothing better, climb to the dome of the cage to
make their preparations and to spin a supporting network for the
chrysalid's needs.Among these spinners we see some weaklings working
listlessly at their carpet.Their appearance makes us deem them in the
grip of a mortal disease.I take a few of them and open their bellies,
using a needle by way of a scalpel.What comes out is a bunch of green
entrails, soaked in a bright yellow fluid, which is really the
creature's blood.These tangled intestines swarm with little lazy
grubs, varying greatly in number, from ten or twenty at least to
sometimes half a hundred.They are the offspring of the Microgaster.The lens makes conscientious enquiries; nowhere
does it manage to show me the vermin attacking solid nourishment, fatty
tissues, muscles or other parts; nowhere do I see them bite, gnaw, or
dissect.The following experiment will tell us more fully: I pour into
a watch-glass the crowds extracted from the hospitable paunches.I
flood them with caterpillar's blood obtained by simple pricks; I place
the preparation under a glass bell-jar, in a moist atmosphere, to
prevent evaporation; I repeat the nourishing bath by means of fresh
bleedings and give them the stimulant which they would have gained from
the living caterpillar.Thanks to these precautions, my charges have
all the appearance of excellent health; they drink and thrive.But this
state of things cannot last long.Soon ripe for the transformation, my
grubs leave the dining-room of the watch-glass as they would have left
the caterpillar's belly; they come to the ground to try and weave their
tiny cocoons.They have missed a
suitable support, that is to say, the silky carpet provided by the
dying caterpillar.No matter: I have seen enough to convince me.The
larvae of the Microgaster do not eat in the strict sense of the word;
they live on soup; and that soup is the caterpillar's blood.Examine the parasites closely and you shall see that their diet is
bound to be a liquid one.They are little white grubs, neatly
segmented, with a pointed forepart splashed with tiny black marks, as
though the atom had been slaking its thirst in a drop of ink.It moves
its hind-quarters slowly, without shifting its position.The mouth is a pore, devoid of any apparatus for
disintegration-work: it has no fangs, no horny nippers, no mandibles;
its attack is just a kiss.It does not chew, it sucks, it takes
discreet sips at the moisture all around it.The fact that it refrains entirely from biting is confirmed by my
autopsy of the stricken caterpillars.In the patient's belly,
notwithstanding the number of nurselings who hardly leave room for the
nurse's entrails, everything is in perfect order; nowhere do we see a
trace of mutilation.Nor does aught on the outside betray any havoc
within.The exploited caterpillars graze and move about peacefully,
giving no sign of pain.It is impossible for me to distinguish them
from the unscathed ones in respect of appetite and untroubled
digestion.When the time approaches to weave the carpet for the support of the
chrysalis, an appearance of emaciation at last points to the evil that
is at their vitals.They are stoics who do not
forget their duty in the hour of death.At last they expire, quite
softly, not of any wounds, but of anaemia, even as a lamp goes out when
the oil comes to an end.The living caterpillar,
capable of feeding himself and forming blood, is a necessity for the
welfare of the grubs; he has to last about a month, until the
Microgaster's offspring have achieved their full growth.The two
calendars synchronize in a remarkable way.When the caterpillar leaves
off eating and makes his preparations for the metamorphosis, the
parasites are ripe for the exodus.The bottle dries up when the
drinkers cease to need it; but until that moment it must remain more or
less well-filled, although becoming limper daily.It is important,
therefore, that the caterpillar's existence be not endangered by wounds
which, even though very tiny, would stop the working of the
blood-fountains.With this intent, the drainers of the bottle are, in a
manner of speaking, muzzled; they have by way of a mouth a pore that
sucks without bruising.The dying caterpillar continues to lay the silk of his carpet with a
slow oscillation of the head.The moment now comes for the parasites to
emerge.This happens in June and generally at nightfall.A breach is
made on the ventral surface or else in the sides, never on the back:
one breach only, contrived at a point of minor resistance, at the
junction of two segments; for it is bound to be a toilsome business, in
the absence of a set of filing-tools.Perhaps the grubs take one
another's places at the point attacked and come by turns to work at it
with a kiss.In one short spell, the whole tribe issues through this single opening
and is soon wriggling about, perched on the surface of the caterpillar.The lens cannot perceive the hole, which closes on the instant.There
is not even a haemorrhage: the bottle has been drained too thoroughly.You must press it between your fingers to squeeze out a few drops of
moisture and thus discover the place of exit.Around the caterpillar, who is not always quite dead and who sometimes
even goes on weaving his carpet a moment longer, the vermin at once
begin to work at their cocoons.The straw- thread, drawn from
the silk-glands by a backward jerk of the head, is first fixed to the
white network of the caterpillar and then produces adjacent warp-beams,
so that, by mutual entanglements, the individual works are welded
together and form an agglomeration in which each of the grubs has its
own cabin.For the moment, what is woven is not the real cocoon, but a
general scaffolding which will facilitate the construction of the
separate shells.All these frames rest upon those adjoining and, mixing
up their threads, become a common edifice wherein each grub contrives a
shelter for itself.Here at last the real cocoon is spun, a pretty
little piece of closely-woven work.In my rearing-jars I obtain as many groups of these tiny shells as my
future experiments can wish for.Three-fourths of the caterpillars have
supplied me with them, so ruthless has been the toll of the spring
births.I lodge these groups, one by one, in separate glass tubes, thus
forming a collection on which I can draw at will, while, in view of my
experiments, I keep under observation the whole swarm produced by one
caterpillar.The adult Microgaster appears a fortnight later, in the middle of June.The riotous multitude is in
the full enjoyment of the pairing-season, for the two sexes always
figure among the guests of any one caterpillar.The carnival of these pigmies bewilders the observer and
makes his head swim.Most of the females, wishful of liberty, plunge down to the waist
between the glass of the tube and the plug of cotton-wool that closes
the end turned to the light; but the lower halves remain free and form
a circular gallery in front of which the males hustle one another, take
one another's places and hastily operate.Each bides his turn, each
attends to his little matters for a few moments and then makes way for
his rivals and goes off to start again elsewhere.The turbulent wedding
lasts all the morning and begins afresh next day, a mighty throng of
couples embracing, separating and embracing once more.There is every reason to believe that, in gardens, the mated ones,
finding themselves in isolated couples, would keep quieter.Here, in
the tube, things degenerate into a riot because the assembly is too
numerous for the narrow space.Apparently a little food, a
few sugary mouthfuls extracted from the flowers.I serve up some
provisions in the tubes: not drops of honey, in which the puny
creatures would get stuck, but little strips of paper spread with that
dainty.They come to them, take their stand on them and refresh
themselves.With this diet,
renewed as the strips dry up, I can keep them in very good condition
until the end of my inquisition.The colonists in my spare
tubes are restless and quick of flight; they will have to be
transferred presently to sundry vessels without my risking the loss of
a good number, or even the whole lot, a loss which my hands, my forceps
and other means of coercion would be unable to prevent by checking the
nimble movements of the tiny prisoners.The irresistible attraction of
the sunlight comes to my aid.If I lay one of my tubes horizontally on
the table, turning one end towards the full light of a sunny window,
the captives at once make for the brighter end and play about there for
a long while, without seeking to retreat.If I turn the tube in the
opposite direction, the crowd immediately shifts its quarters and
collects at the other end.With this bait, I can send it whithersoever I please.We will therefore place the new receptacle, jar or test-tube, on the
table, pointing the closed end towards the window.At its mouth, we
open one of the full tubes.No other precaution is needed: even though
the mouth leaves a large interval free, the swarm hastens into the
lighted chamber.All that remains to be done is to close the apparatus
before moving it.The observer is now in control of the multitude,
without appreciable losses, and is able to question it at will.We will begin by asking:

"How do you manage to lodge your germs inside the caterpillar?"This question and others of the same category, which ought to take
precedence of everything else, are generally neglected by the impaler
of insects, who cares more for the niceties of nomenclature than for
glorious realities.He classifies his subjects, dividing them into
regiments with barbarous labels, a work which seems to him the highest
expression of entomological science.Names, nothing but names: the rest
hardly counts.The persecutor of the Pieris used to be called
Microgaster, that is to say, little belly: to-day she is called
Apanteles, that is to say, the incomplete.Can our friend at least tell us how "the Little Belly" or "the
Incomplete" gets into the caterpillar?A book which,
judging by its recent date, should be the faithful echo of our actual
knowledge, informs us that the Microgaster inserts her eggs direct into
the caterpillar's body.It goes on to say that the parasitic vermin
inhabit the chrysalis, whence they make their way out by perforating
the stout horny wrapper.Hundreds of times have I witnessed the exodus
of the grubs ripe for weaving their cocoons; and the exit has always
been made through the skin of the caterpillar and never through the
armour of the chrysalis.The fact that its mouth is a mere clinging
pore, deprived of any offensive weapon, would even lead me to believe
that the grub is incapable of perforating the chrysalid's covering.This proved error makes me doubt the other proposition, though logical,
after all, and agreeing with the methods followed by a host of
parasites.No matter: my faith in what I read in print is of the
slightest; I prefer to go straight to facts.Before making a statement
of any kind, I want to see, what I call seeing.It is a slower and more
laborious process; but it is certainly much safer.I will not undertake to lie in wait for what takes place on the
cabbages in the garden: that method is too uncertain and besides does
not lend itself to precise observation.As I have in hand the necessary
materials, to wit, my collection of tubes swarming with the parasites
newly hatched into the adult form, I will operate on the little table
in my animals' laboratory.A jar with a capacity of about a litre
(About 1 3/4 pints, or.22 gallon.--Translator's Note.)is placed on
the table, with the bottom turned towards the window in the sun.I put
into it a cabbage-leaf covered with caterpillars, sometimes fully
developed, sometimes half-way, sometimes just out of the egg.A strip
of honeyed paper will serve the Microgaster as a dining room, if the
experiment is destined to take some time.Lastly, by the method of
transfer which I described above, I send the inmates of one of my tubes
into the apparatus.Once the jar is closed, there is nothing left to do
but to let things take their course and to keep an assiduous watch, for
days and weeks, if need be.The caterpillars graze placidly, heedless of their terrible attendants.If some giddy-pates in the turbulent swarm pass over the caterpillars'
spines, these draw up their fore-part with a jerk and as suddenly lower
it again; and that is all: the intruders forthwith decamp.Nor do the
latter seem to contemplate any harm: they refresh themselves on the
honey-smeared strip, they come and go tumultuously.Their short flights
may land them, now in one place, now in another, on the browsing herd,
but they pay no attention to it.What we see is casual meetings, not
deliberate encounters.In vain I change the flock of caterpillars and vary their age; in vain
I change the squad of parasites; in vain I follow events in the jar for
long hours, morning and evening, both in a dim light and in the full
glare of the sun: I succeed in seeing nothing, absolutely nothing, on
the parasite's side, that resembles an attack.No matter what the
ill-informed authors say--ill-informed because they had not the
patience to see for themselves--the conclusion at which I arrive is
positive: to inject the germs, the Microgaster never attacks the
caterpillars.The invasion, therefore, is necessarily effected through the
Butterfly's eggs themselves, as experiment will prove.My broad jar
would tell against the inspection of the troop, kept at too great a
distance by the glass enclosure, and I therefore select a tube an inch
wide.I place in this a shred of cabbage-leaf, bearing a slab of eggs,
as laid by the Butterfly.I next introduce the inmates of one of my
spare vessels.A strip of paper smeared with honey accompanies the new
arrivals.Soon, the females are there, fussing about,
sometimes to the extent of blackening the whole slab of yellow eggs.They inspect the treasure, flutter their wings and brush their
hind-legs against each other, a sign of keen satisfaction.They sound
the heap, probe the interstices with their antennae and tap the
individual eggs with their palpi; then, this one here, that one there,
they quickly apply the tip of their abdomen to the egg selected.Each
time, we see a slender, horny prickle darting from the ventral surface,
close to the end.This is the instrument that deposits the germ under
the film of the egg; it is the inoculation-needle.The operation is
performed calmly and methodically, even when several mothers are
working at one and the same time.Where one has been, a second goes,
followed by a third, a fourth and others yet, nor am I able definitely
to see the end of the visits paid to the same egg.Each time, the
needle enters and inserts a germ.It is impossible, in such a crowd, for the eye to follow the successive
mothers who hasten to lay in each; but there is one quite practicable
method by which we can estimate the number of germs introduced into a
single egg, which is, later, to open the ravaged caterpillars and count
the grubs which they contain.A less repugnant means is to number the
little cocoons heaped up around each dead caterpillar.The total will
tell us how many germs were injected, some by the same mother returning
several times to the egg already treated, others by different mothers.Well, the number of these cocoons varies greatly.Generally, it
fluctuates in the neighbourhood of twenty, but I have come across as
many as sixty-five; and nothing tells me that this is the extreme
limit.What hideous industry for the extermination of a Butterfly's
progeny!I am fortunate at this moment in having a highly-cultured visitor,
versed in the profundities of philosophic thought.I make way for him
before the apparatus wherein the Microgaster is at work.For an hour
and more, standing lens in hand, he, in his turn, looks and sees what I
have just seen; he watches the layers who go from one egg to the other,
make their choice, draw their slender lancet and prick what the stream
of passers-by, one after the other, have already pricked.Thoughtful
and a little uneasy, he puts down his lens at last.Never had he been
vouchsafed so clear a glimpse as here, in my finger-wide tube, of the
masterly brigandage that runs through all life down to that of the very
smallest.Apanteles, see Microgaster glomeratus.Arundo donax, the great reed.Burying-beetles: method of burial.Cabbage Butterfly, her selection of suitable Cruciferae.Calliphora vomitaria, see Bluebottle.Cetonia, or Rose-chafer.Clairville on the Burying-beetle.Cruciferae, the diet of Pieris brassicae.Epeira, Angular, telegraph wire of.nest of E. pomiformis.prey found in nest of E.

every where (of a sort of fever), that never was heard of almost, unless
it was in a plague-time.Among others, the famous Tom Fuller is dead of it; and Dr.Nichols, Dean
of Paul's; and my Lord General Monk is very dangerously ill.Dined at
home with the children and were merry, and my father with me; who after
dinner he and I went forth about business.John Williams at an alehouse, where we staid till past nine at
night, in Shoe Lane, talking about our country business, and I found him
so well acquainted with the matters of Gravely that I expect he will be of
great use to me.I understand my Aunt Fenner is upon
the point of death.At the Privy Seal, where we had a seal this morning.Then met with
Ned Pickering, and walked with him into St.James's Park (where I had not
been a great while), and there found great and very noble alterations.And, in our discourse, he was very forward to complain and to speak loud
of the lewdness and beggary of the Court, which I am sorry to hear, and
which I am afeard will bring all to ruin again.So he and I to the
Wardrobe to dinner, and after dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Opera,
and saw "The Witts" again, which I like exceedingly.The Queen of Bohemia
was here, brought by my Lord Craven.So the Captain and I and another to
the Devil tavern and drank, and so by coach home.Troubled in mind that I
cannot bring myself to mind my business, but to be so much in love of
plays.We have been at a great loss a great while for a vessel that I
sent about a month ago with, things of my Lord's to Lynn, and cannot till
now hear of them, but now we are told that they are put into Soale Bay,
but to what purpose I know not.To our own church in the morning and so home to
dinner, where my father and Dr.Tom Pepys came to me to dine, and were
very merry.Sidney to my Lady to see
my Lord Hinchingbroke, who is now pretty well again, and sits up and walks
about his chamber.So I went to White Hall, and there hear that my Lord
General Monk continues very ill: so I went to la belle Pierce and sat with
her; and then to walk in St.James's Park, and saw great variety of fowl
which I never saw before and so home.At night fell to read in "Hooker's
Ecclesiastical Polity," which Mr.Moore did give me last Wednesday very
handsomely bound; and which I shall read with great pains and love for his
sake.At the office all the morning; at noon the children are sent for by
their mother my Lady Sandwich to dinner, and my wife goes along with them
by coach, and she to my father's and dines there, and from thence with
them to see Mrs.Cordery, who do invite them before my father goes into
the country, and thither I should have gone too but that I am sent for to
the Privy Seal, and there I found a thing of my Lord Chancellor's

     [This "thing" was probably one of those large grants which Clarendon
     quietly, or, as he himself says, "without noise or scandal,"
     procured from the king.Besides lands and manors, Clarendon states
     at one time that the king gave him a "little billet into his hand,
     that contained a warrant of his own hand-writing to Sir Stephen Fox
     to pay to the Chancellor the sum of L20,000,--[approximately 10
     million dollars in the year 2000]--of which nobody could have
     notice."In 1662 he received L5,000 out of the money voted to the
     king by the Parliament of Ireland, as he mentions in his vindication
     of himself against the impeachment of the Commons; and we shall see
     that Pepys, in February, 1664, names another sum of L20,000 given to
     the Chancellor to clear the mortgage upon Clarendon Park; and this
     last sum, it was believed, was paid from the money received from
     France by the sale of Dunkirk.--B.]to be sealed this afternoon, and so I am forced to go to Worcester House,
where severall Lords are met in Council this afternoon.And while I am
waiting there, in comes the King in a plain common riding-suit and velvet
cap, in which he seemed a very ordinary man to one that had not known him.Here I staid till at last, hearing that my Lord Privy Seal had not the
seal here, Mr.Moore and I hired a coach and went to Chelsy, and there at
an alehouse sat and drank and past the time till my Lord Privy Seal came
to his house, and so we to him and examined and sealed the thing, and so
homewards, but when we came to look for our coach we found it gone, so we
were fain to walk home afoot and saved our money.We met with a companion
that walked with us, and coming among some trees near the Neate houses, he
began to whistle, which did give us some suspicion, but it proved that he
that answered him was Mr.Marsh (the Lutenist) and his wife, and so we all
walked to Westminster together, in our way drinking a while at my cost,
and had a song of him, but his voice is quite lost.So walked home, and
there I found that my Lady do keep the children at home, and lets them not
come any more hither at present, which a little troubles me to lose their
company.At the office in the morning and all the afternoon at home to put
my papers in order.This day we come to some agreement with Sir R. Ford
for his house to be added to the office to enlarge our quarters.This morning by appointment I went to my father, and after a
morning draft he and I went to Dr.Williams, but he not within we went to
Mrs.Whately's, who lately offered a proposal of
her sister for a wife for my brother Tom, and with her we discoursed about
and agreed to go to her mother this afternoon to speak with her, and in
the meantime went to Will.Joyce's and to an alehouse, and drank a good
while together, he being very angry that his father Fenner will give him
and his brother no more for mourning than their father did give him and my
aunt at their mother's death, and a very troublesome fellow I still find
him to be, that his company ever wearys me.From thence about two o'clock
to Mrs.Whately's, but she being going to dinner we went to Whitehall and
there staid till past three, and here I understand by Mr.Moore that my
Lady Sandwich is brought to bed yesterday of a young Lady, and is very
well.Whately's again, and there were well received, and she
desirous to have the thing go forward, only is afeard that her daughter is
too young and portion not big enough, but offers L200 down with her.The
girl is very well favoured,, and a very child, but modest, and one I think
will do very well for my brother: so parted till she hears from Hatfield
from her husband, who is there; but I find them very desirous of it, and
so am I. Hence home to my father's, and I to the Wardrobe, where I supped
with the ladies, and hear their mother is well and the young child, and so
home.To the Privy Seal, and sealed; so home at noon, and there took my
wife by coach to my uncle Fenner's, where there was both at his house and
the Sessions, great deal of company, but poor entertainment, which I
wonder at; and the house so hot, that my uncle Wight, my father and I were
fain to go out, and stay at an alehouse awhile to cool ourselves.Then
back again and to church, my father's family being all in mourning, doing
him the greatest honour, the world believing that he did give us it: so to
church, and staid out the sermon, and then with my aunt Wight, my wife,
and Pall and I to her house by coach, and there staid and supped upon a
Westphalia ham, and so home and to bed.This morning I went to my father's, and there found him and my
mother in a discontent, which troubles me much, and indeed she is become
very simple and unquiet.Williams, and found him
within, and there we sat and talked a good while, and from him to Tom
Trice's to an alehouse near, and there sat and talked, and finding him
fair we examined my uncle's will before him and Dr.Williams, and had them
sign the copy and so did give T. Trice the original to prove, so he took
my father and me to one of the judges of the Court, and there we were
sworn, and so back again to the alehouse and drank and parted.Williams and I to a cook's where we eat a bit of mutton, and away, I to W.
Joyce's, where by appointment my wife was, and I took her to the Opera,
and shewed her "The Witts," which I had seen already twice, and was most
highly pleased with it.So with my wife to the Wardrobe to see my Lady,
and then home.At the office all the morning and did business; by and by we are
called to Sir W. Batten's to see the strange creature that Captain Holmes
hath brought with him from Guiny; it is a great baboon, but so much like a
man in most things, that though they say there is a species of them, yet I
cannot believe but that it is a monster got of a man and she-baboon.I do
believe that it already understands much English, and I am of the mind it
might be taught to speak or make signs.Hence the Comptroller and I to
Sir Rd.Ford's and viewed the house again, and are come to a complete end
with him to give him L200 per an.Isham
inquiring for me to take his leave of me, he being upon his voyage to
Portugal, and for my letters to my Lord which are not ready.But I took
him to the Mitre and gave him a glass of sack, and so adieu, and then
straight to the Opera, and there saw "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," done
with scenes very well, but above all, Betterton

     [Sir William Davenant introduced the use of scenery.The character
     of Hamlet was one of Betterton's masterpieces.Downes tells us that
     he was taught by Davenant how the part was acted by Taylor of the
     Blackfriars, who was instructed by Shakespeare himself.]Hence homeward, and met with
Mr.Spong and took him to the Sampson in Paul's churchyard, and there
staid till late, and it rained hard, so we were fain to get home wet, and
so to bed.At church in the morning, and dined at home alone with
my wife very comfortably, and so again to church with her, and had a very
good and pungent sermon of Mr.Mills, discoursing the necessity of
restitution.Home, and I found my Lady Batten and her daughter to look
something askew upon my wife, because my wife do not buckle to them, and
is not solicitous for their acquaintance, which I am not troubled at at
all.By and by comes in my father (he intends to go into the country
to-morrow), and he and I among other discourse at last called Pall up to
us, and there in great anger told her before my father that I would keep
her no longer, and my father he said he would have nothing to do with her.At last, after we had brought down her high spirit, I got my father to
yield that she should go into the country with my mother and him, and stay
there awhile to see how she will demean herself.That being done, my
father and I to my uncle Wight's, and there supped, and he took his leave
of them, and so I walked with [him] as far as Paul's and there parted, and
I home, my mind at some rest upon this making an end with Pall, who do
trouble me exceedingly.This morning before I went out I made even with my maid Jane, who
has this day been my maid three years, and is this day to go into the
country to her mother.The poor girl cried, and I could hardly forbear
weeping to think of her going, for though she be grown lazy and spoilt by
Pall's coming, yet I shall never have one to please us better in all
things, and so harmless, while I live.So I paid her her wages and gave
her 2s.over, and bade her adieu, with my mind full of trouble at her
going.Hence to my father, where he and I and Thomas together setting
things even, and casting up my father's accounts, and upon the whole I
find that all he hath in money of his own due to him in the world is but
L45, and he owes about the same sum: so that I cannot but think in what a
condition he had left my mother if he should have died before my uncle
Robert.Hence to Tom Trice for the probate of the will and had it done to
my mind, which did give my father and me good content.From thence to my
Lady at the Wardrobe and thence to the Theatre, and saw the "Antipodes,"
wherein there is much mirth, but no great matter else.Bostock whom I met there (a clerk formerly of Mr.Phelps) to the Devil
tavern, and there drank and so away.I to my uncle Fenner's, where my
father was with him at an alehouse, and so we three went by ourselves and
sat talking a great while about a broker's daughter that he do propose for
a wife for Tom, with a great portion, but I fear it will not take, but he
will do what he can.So we broke up, and going through the street we met
with a mother and son, friends of my father's man, Ned's, who are angry at
my father's putting him away, which troubled me and my father, but all
will be well as to that.We have news this morning of my uncle Thomas and
his son Thomas being gone into the country without giving notice thereof
to anybody, which puts us to a stand, but I fear them not.At night at
home I found a letter from my Lord Sandwich, who is now very well again of
his feaver, but not yet gone from Alicante, where he lay sick, and was
twice let blood.This letter dated the 22nd July last, which puts me out
of doubt of his being ill.In my coming home I called in at the Crane
tavern at the Stocks by appointment, and there met and took leave of Mr.Fanshaw, who goes to-morrow and Captain Isham toward their voyage to
Portugal.Here we drank a great deal of wine, I too much and Mr.Fanshaw
till he could hardly go.This morning to the Wardrobe, and there took leave of my Lord
Hinchingbroke and his brother, and saw them go out by coach toward Rye in
their way to France, whom God bless.Then I was called up to my Lady's
bedside, where we talked an hour about Mr.Edward Montagu's disposing of
the L5000 for my Lord's departure for Portugal, and our fears that he will
not do it to my Lord's honour, and less to his profit, which I am to
enquire a little after.Hence to the office, and there sat till noon, and
then my wife and I by coach to my cozen, Thos.Pepys, the Executor, to
dinner, where some ladies and my father and mother, where very merry, but
methinks he makes but poor dinners for such guests, though there was a
poor venison pasty.Hence my wife and I to the Theatre, and there saw
"The Joviall Crew," where the King, Duke and Duchess, and Madame Palmer,
were; and my wife, to her great content, had a full sight of them all the
while.Hence to my father's, and there staid to
talk a while and so by foot home by moonshine.In my way and at home, my
wife making a sad story to me of her brother Balty's a condition, and
would have me to do something for him, which I shall endeavour to do, but
am afeard to meddle therein for fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands
of him again, when I once concern myself for him.I went to bed, my wife
all the while telling me his case with tears, which troubled me.At home all the morning setting papers in order.At noon to the
Exchange, and there met with Dr.Williams by appointment, and with him
went up and down to look for an attorney, a friend of his, to advise with
about our bond of my aunt Pepys of L200, and he tells me absolutely that
we shall not be forced to pay interest for the money yet.I spent the whole afternoon drinking with him and so home.This day I counterfeited a letter to Sir W. Pen, as from the thief that
stole his tankard lately, only to abuse and laugh at him.At the office all the morning, and at noon my father, mother, and
my aunt Bell (the first time that ever she was at my house) come to dine
with me, and were very merry.After dinner the two women went to visit my
aunt Wight, &c., and my father about other business, and I abroad to my
bookseller, and there staid till four o'clock, at which time by
appointment I went to meet my father at my uncle Fenner's.So thither I
went and with him to an alehouse, and there came Mr.Evans, the taylor,
whose daughter we have had a mind to get for a wife for Tom, and then my
father, and there we sat a good while and talked about the business; in
fine he told us that he hath not to except against us or our motion, but
that the estate that God hath blessed him with is too great to give where
there is nothing in present possession but a trade and house; and so we
friendly ended.There parted, my father and I together, and walked a
little way, and then at Holborn he and I took leave of one another, he
being to go to Brampton (to settle things against my mother comes)
tomorrow morning.At noon my wife and I met at the Wardrobe, and there dined with the
children, and after dinner up to my Lady's bedside, and talked and laughed
a good while.Then my wife end I to Drury Lane to the French comedy,
which was so ill done, and the scenes and company and every thing else so
nasty and out of order and poor, that I was sick all the while in my mind
to be there.Here my wife met with a son of my Lord Somersett, whom she
knew in France, a pretty man; I showed him no great countenance, to avoyd
further acquaintance.That done, there being nothing pleasant but the
foolery of the farce, we went home.At home and the office all the morning, and at noon comes Luellin
to me, and he and I to the tavern and after that to Bartholomew fair, and
there upon his motion to a pitiful alehouse, where we had a dirty slut or
two come up that were whores, but my very heart went against them, so that
I took no pleasure but a great deal of trouble in being there and getting
from thence for fear of being seen.From hence he and I walked towards
Ludgate and parted.I back again to the fair all alone, and there met
with my Ladies Jemimah and Paulina, with Mr.Pickering and Madamoiselle,
at seeing the monkeys dance, which was much to see, when they could be
brought to do so, but it troubled me to sit among such nasty company.After that with them into Christ's Hospitall, and there Mr.Pickering
bought them some fairings, and I did give every one of them a bauble,
which was the little globes of glass with things hanging in them, which
pleased the ladies very well.After that home with them in their coach,
and there was called up to my Lady, and she would have me stay to talk
with her, which I did I think a full hour.And the poor lady did with so
much innocency tell me how Mrs.Crispe had told her that she did intend,
by means of a lady that lies at her house, to get the King to be godfather
to the young lady that she is in childbed now of; but to see in what a
manner my Lady told it me, protesting that she sweat in the very telling
of it, was the greatest pleasure to me in the world to see the simplicity
and harmlessness of a lady.Then down to supper with the ladies, and so
home, Mr.Moore (as he and I cannot easily part) leading me as far as
Fenchurch Street to the Mitre, where we drank a glass of wine and so
parted, and I home and to bed.My maid Jane newly gone, and Pall left now to do all
the work till another maid comes, which shall not be till she goes away
into the country with my mother.My Lord
Sandwich in the Straits and newly recovered of a great sickness at
Alicante.My father gone to settle at Brampton, and myself under much
business and trouble for to settle things in the estate to our content.But what is worst, I find myself lately too much given to seeing of plays,
and expense, and pleasure, which makes me forget my business, which I must
labour to amend.No money comes in, so that I have been forced to borrow
a great deal for my own expenses, and to furnish my father, to leave
things in order.I have some trouble about my brother Tom, who is now
left to keep my father's trade, in which I have great fears that he will
miscarry for want of brains and care.At Court things are in very ill
condition, there being so much emulacion, poverty, and the vices of
drinking, swearing, and loose amours, that I know not what will be the end
of it, but confusion.And the Clergy so high, that all people that I meet
with do protest against their practice.In short, I see no content or
satisfaction any where, in any one sort of people.The Benevolence

     [A voluntary contribution made by the subjects to their sovereign.Upon this occasion the clergy alone gave L33,743: See May 31st,

proves so little, and an occasion of so much discontent every where; that
it had better it had never been set up.We are
at our Office quiet, only for lack of money all things go to rack.Our
very bills offered to be sold upon the Exchange at 10 per cent.We
are upon getting Sir R. Ford's house added to our Office.But I see so
many difficulties will follow in pleasing of one another in the dividing
of it, and in becoming bound personally to pay the rent of L200 per annum,
that I do believe it will yet scarce come to pass.The season very sickly
every where of strange and fatal fevers.ETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:

     Sat before Mrs.An amusing incident,
he relates, which came under his observation a few years ago will
bear relating.A farmer discovered the lair of an old dog Fox by
means of his hound, who trailed the animal to his hole.This Fox had
been making large and nightly inroads into the poultry ranks of the
neighborhood, and had acquired great and unenviable notoriety on that
account.The farmer and two companions, armed with spades and hoes,
and accompanied by the faithful hound, started to dig out the Fox.The
hole was situated on the sandy <DW72> of a hill, and after a laborious
and continued digging of four hours, Reynard was unearthed and he and
Rep, the dog, were soon engaged in deadly strife.The excitement had
waxed hot, and dog, men, and Fox were all struggling in a promiscuous
melee.Soon a burly farmer watching his chance strikes wildly with his
hoe-handle for Reynard's head, which is scarcely distinguishable in the
maze of legs and bodies.a sudden movement
of the hairy mass brings the fierce stroke upon the faithful dog, who
with a wild howl relaxes his grasp and rolls with bruised and bleeding
head, faint and powerless on the hillside.Reynard takes advantage of
the turn affairs have assumed, and before the gun, which had been laid
aside on the grass some hours before, can be reached he disappears over
the crest of the hill.Hallock says that an old she-Fox with young, to supply them with food,
will soon deplete the hen-roost and destroy both old and great numbers
of very young chickens.They generally travel by night, follow regular
runs, and are exceedingly shy of any invention for their capture, and
the use of traps is almost futile.If caught in a trap, they will gnaw
off the captured foot and escape, in which respect they fully support
their ancient reputation for cunning.Copyright by

abounds everywhere; absolutely unmolested, they are as tame as a
poultry yard, making the country one vast aviary.Yellow-beaked Minas,
Ring-doves, Jays, Hoopoes, and Parrots take dust baths with the merry
Palm-squirrel in the roadway, hardly troubling themselves to hop out
of the way of the heavy bull-carts; every wayside pond and lake is
alive with Ducks, Wild Geese, Flamingoes, Pelicans, and waders of every
size and sort, from dainty red-legged beauties the size of Pigeons up
to the great unwieldy Cranes and Adjutants five feet high.We pass a
dead Sheep with two loathsome vultures picking over the carcass, and
presently a brood of fluffy young Partridges with father and mother in
charge look at us fearlessly within ten feet of our whirling carriage.Every village has its flock of sacred Peacocks pacing gravely through
the surrounding gardens and fields, and Woodpeckers and Kingfishers
flash about like jewels in the blazing sunlight."----

WARNING COLORS.--Very complete experiments in support of the theory
of warning colors, first suggested by Bates and also by Wallace, have
been made in India by Mr.He concludes
that there is a general appetite for Butterflies among insectivorous
birds, though they are rarely seen when wild to attack them; also that
many, probably most birds, dislike, if not intensely, at any rate
in comparison with other Butterflies, those of the Danais genus and
three other kinds, including a species of Papilio, which is the most
distasteful.The mimics of these Butterflies are relatively palatable.He found that each bird has to separately acquire its experience with
bad-tasting Butterflies, but well remembers what it learns.He also
experimented with Lizards, and noticed that, unlike the birds, they ate
the nauseous as well as other Butterflies.----

INCREASE IN ZOOLOGICAL PRESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES--The
establishment of the National Zoological Park, Washington, has led
to the formation of many other zoological preserves in the United
States.In the western part of New Hampshire is an area of 26,000
acres, established by the late Austin Corbin, and containing 74 Bison,
200 Moose, 1,500 Elk, 1,700 Deer of different species, and 150 Wild
Boar, all of which are rapidly multiplying.In the Adirondacks, a
preserve of 9,000 acres has been stocked with Elk, Virginia Deer,
Muledeer, Rabbits, and Pheasants.The same animals are preserved by W.
C. Whitney on an estate of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire Hills, near
Lenox, Mass., where also he keeps Bison and Antelope.Other preserves
are Nehasane Park, in the Adirondacks, 8,000 acres; Tranquillity Park,
near Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000 acres; the Alling preserve, near Tacoma,
Washington, 5,000 acres; North Lodge, near St.Paul, Minn., 400 acres;
and Furlough Lodge, in the Catskills, N. Y., 600 acres.----

ROBINS ABUNDANT--Not for many years have these birds been so numerous
as during 1898.Once, under some wide-spreading willow trees, where the
ground was bare and soft, we counted about forty Red-breasts feeding
together, and on several occasions during the summer we saw so many in
flocks, that we could only guess at the number.When unmolested, few
birds become so tame and none are more interesting.East of the Missouri River the Gray Squirrel is found almost
everywhere, and is perhaps the most common variety.Wherever there is
timber it is almost sure to be met with, and in many localities is very
abundant, especially where it has had an opportunity to breed without
unusual disturbance.Its usual color is pale gray above and white or
yellowish white beneath, but individuals of the species grade from this
color through all the stages to jet black.Gray and black Squirrels
are often found associating together.They are said to be in every
respect alike, in the anatomy of their bodies, habits, and in every
detail excepting the color, and by many sportsmen they are regarded as
distinct species, and that the black form is merely due to melanism,
an anomaly not uncommon among animals.Whether this be the correct
explanation may well be left to further scientific observation.Like all the family, the Gray Squirrels feed in the early morning
just after sunrise and remain during the middle of the day in their
hole or nest.It is in the early morning or the late afternoon, when
they again appear in search of the evening meal, that the wise hunter
lies in wait for them.Then they may be heard and seen playing and
chattering together till twilight.Sitting upright and motionless
on a log the intruder will rarely be discovered by them, but at the
slightest movement they scamper away, hardly to return.This fact is
taken advantage of by the sportsmen, and, says an observer, be he
at all familiar with the runways of the Squirrels at any particular
locality he may sit by the path and bag a goodly number.Gray and Black
Squirrels generally breed twice during the spring and summer, and have
several young at a litter.We have been told that an incident of migration of Squirrels of a very
remarkable kind occurred a good many years ago, caused by lack of mast
and other food, in New York State.When the creatures arrived at the
Niagara river, their apparent destination being Canada, they seemed
to hesitate before attempting to cross the swift running stream.The
current is very rapid, exceeding seven miles an hour.They finally
ventured in the water, however, and with tails spread for sails,
succeeded in making the opposite shore, but more than a mile below the
point of entrance.They are better swimmers than one would fancy them
to be, as they have much strength and endurance.We remember when a
boy seeing some mischievous urchins repeatedly throw a tame Squirrel
into deep water for the cruel pleasure of watching it swim ashore.The
"sport" was soon stopped, however, by a passerby, who administered a
rebuke that could hardly be forgotten.Squirrels are frequently domesticated and become as tame as any
household tabby.Unfortunately Dogs and Cats seem to show a relentless
enmity toward them, as they do toward all rodents.The Squirrel is
willing to be friendly, and no doubt would gladly affiliate with
them, but the instinct of the canine and the feline impels them to
exterminate it.We once gave shelter and food to a strange Cat and
was rewarded by seeing it fiercely attack and kill a beautiful white
Rabbit which until then had had the run of the yard and never before
been molested.Until we shall be able to teach the beasts of the field
something of our sentimental humanitarianism we can scarcely expect to
see examples of cruelty wholly disappear.I killed a Robin--the little thing,
    With scarlet breast on a glossy wing,
      That comes in the apple tree to sing.I flung a stone as he twittered there,
      I only meant to give him a scare,
      But off it went--and hit him square.A little flutter--a little cry--
      Then on the ground I saw him lie.I didn't think he was going to die.But as I watched him I soon could see
      He never would sing for you or me
      Any more in the apple tree.Never more in the morning light,
      Never more in the sunshine bright,
      Trilling his song in gay delight.And I'm thinking, every summer day,
      How never, never, I can repay
      The little life that I took away.--SYDNEY DAYRE, in The Youth's Companion.THE PECTORAL SANDPIPER.More than a score of Sandpipers are described in the various works
on ornithology.The one presented here, however, is perhaps the most
curious specimen, distributed throughout North, Central, and South
America, breeding in the Arctic regions.It is also of frequent
occurrence in Europe.Low, wet lands, muddy flats, and the edges
of shallow pools of water are its favorite resorts.The birds move
in flocks, but, while feeding, scatter as they move about, picking
and probing here and there for their food, which consists of worms,
insects, small shell fish, tender rootlets, and birds; "but at the
report of a gun," says Col.Goss, "or any sudden fright, spring into
the air, utter a low whistling note, quickly bunch together, flying
swift and strong, usually in a zigzag manner, and when not much hunted
often circle and drop back within shot; for they are not naturally
a timid or suspicious bird, and when quietly and slowly approached,
sometimes try to hide by squatting close to the ground."Of the Pectoral Sandpiper's nesting habits, little has been known until
recently.Nelson's interesting description, in his report upon
"Natural History Collections in Alaska," we quote as follows: "The
night of May 24, 1889, I lay wrapped in my blanket, and from the raised
flap of the tent looked out over as dreary a cloud-covered landscape as
can be imagined.As my eyelids began to droop and the scene to become
indistinct, suddenly a low, hollow, booming note struck my ear and
sent my thoughts back to a spring morning in northern Illinois, and
to the loud vibrating tones of the Prairie Chickens.[See BIRDS AND
ALL NATURE, Vol.Again the sound arose, nearer and more
distinct, and with an effort I brought myself back to the reality of my
position, and, resting upon one elbow, listened.A few seconds passed,
and again arose the note; a moment later I stood outside the tent.The
open flat extended away on all sides, with apparently not a living
creature near.Once again the note was repeated close by, and a glance
revealed its author.Standing in the thin grass ten or fifteen yards
from me, with its throat inflated until it was as large as the rest of
the bird, was a male Pectoral Sandpiper.The succeeding days afforded
opportunity to observe the bird as it uttered its singular notes, under
a variety of situations, and at various hours of the day, or during the
light Arctic night.The note is deep, hollow, and resonant, but at the
same time liquid and musical, and may be represented by a repetition of
the syllables _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_."The bird
may frequently be seen running along the ground close to the female,
its enormous sac inflated.Murdock says the birds breed in abundance at Point Barrow, Alaska,
and that the nest is always built in the grass, with a preference for
high and dry localities.The nest was like that of the other waders, a
depression in the ground, lined with a little dry grass.The eggs are
four, of pale purplish-gray and light neutral tint.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.Why was the sight
    To such a tender ball as th' eye confined,
    So obvious and so easy to be quenched,
    And not, as feeling, through all parts diffused;
    That she might look at will through every pore?--MILTON."But bein' only eyes, you see, my wision's limited."The reason we know anything at all is that various forms of vibration
are capable of affecting our organs of sense.These agitate the brain,
the mind perceives, and from perception arise the higher forms of
thought.Perhaps the most important of the senses is sight.It ranges
in power from the mere ability to perceive the difference between light
and darkness up to a marvelous means of knowing the nature of objects
of various forms and sizes, at both near and remote range.One the simplest forms of eyes is found in the Sea-anemone.It has a
 mass of pigment cells and refractive bodies that break up the
light which falls upon them, and it is able to know day and night.An examination of this simple organ leads one to think the scientist
not far wrong who claimed that the eye is a development from what was
once merely a particular sore spot that was sensitive to the action
of light.The protophyte, _Euglena varidis_, has what seems to be the
least complicated of all sense organs in the transparent spot in the
front of its body.We know that rays of light have power to alter the color of certain
substances.The retina of the eye is changed in color by exposure to
continued rays of light.Frogs in whose eyes the color of the retina
has apparently been all changed by sunshine are still able to take a
fly accurately and to recognize certain colors.Whether the changes produced by light upon the retina are all chemical
or all physical or partly both remains open to discussion.An interesting experiment was performed by Professor Tyndall proving
that heat rays do not affect the eye optically.He was operating along
the line of testing the power of the eye to transmit to the sensorium
the presence of certain forms of radiant energy.It is well known that
certain waves are unnoticed by the eye but are registered distinctly
by the photographic plate, and he first showed beyond doubt that heat
waves as such have no effect upon the retina.By separating the light
and heat rays from an electric lantern and focusing the latter, he
brought their combined energy to play where his own eye could be placed
directly in contact with them, first protecting the exterior of his
eye from the heat rays.There was no sensation whatever as a result,
but when, directly afterward, he placed a sheet of platinum at the
convergence of the dark rays it quickly became red hot with the energy
which his eye was unable to recognize.The eye is a camera obscura with a very imperfect lens and a receiving
plate irregularly sensitized; but it has marvelous powers of quick
adjustment.The habits of the animal determine the character of the
eye.Birds of rapid flight and those which scan the earth minutely
from lofty courses are able to adjust their vision quickly to long and
short range.The eye of the Owl is subject to his will as he swings
noiselessly down upon the Mouse in the grass.The nearer the object the
more the eye is protruded and the deeper its form from front to rear.The human eye adjusts its power well for small objects within a few
inches and readily reaches out for those several miles away.A curious
feature is that we are able to adjust the eye for something at long
range in less time than for something close at hand.If we are reading
and someone calls our attention to an object on the distant hillside,
the eye adjusts itself to the distance in less than a second, but when
we return our vision to the printed page several seconds are consumed
in the re-adjustment.The Condor of the Andes has great powers of sight.He wheels in
beautiful curves high in the air scrutinizing the ground most carefully
and all the time apparently keeping track of all the other Condors
within a range of several miles.No sooner does one of his kind descend
to the earth than those near him shoot for the same spot hoping the
find may be large enough for a dinner party.Others soaring at greater
distances note their departure and follow in great numbers so that when
the carcass discovered by one Condor proves to be a large one, hundreds
of these huge birds congregate to enjoy the feast.The Condor's
eyes have been well compared to opera glasses, their extension and
contraction are so great.The Eagle soars towards the sun with fixed gaze and apparent fullness
of enjoyment.This would ruin his sight were it not for the fact
that he and all other birds are provided with an extra inner eyelid
called the nictitating membrane which may be drawn at will over the
eye to protect it from too strong a light.Cuvier made the discovery
that the eye of the Eagle, which had up to his time been supposed of
peculiarly great strength to enable it to feast upon the sun's rays, is
closed during its great flights just as the eye of the barnyard fowl
is occasionally rested by the use of this delicate semi-transparent
membrane.Several of the mammals, among them being the horse, are
equipped with such an inner eyelid.One of my most striking experiences on the ocean was had when I pulled
in my first Flounder and found both of his eyes on the same side of
his head.On the side which
glides over the bottom of the sea, the Halibut, Turbot, Plaice, and
Sole are almost white, the upper side being dark enough to be scarcely
distinguishable from the ground.On the upper side are the two eyes,
while the lower side is blind.When first born the fish swims upright with a slight tendency to favor
one side; its eyes are on opposite sides of the head, as in most
vertebrates and the head itself is regular.With age and experience in
exploring the bottom on one side, the under eye refuses to remain away
from the light and gradually turns upward, bringing with it the bones
of the skull to such an extent that the adult Flat-fish becomes the
apparently deformed creature that appears in our markets as a regular
product of the deep.The eyeless inhabitant of the streams in Mammoth Cave presents a
curious instance of the total loss of a sense which remains unused.These little fishes are not only without sight but are also almost
destitute of color and markings, the general appearance being much like
that of a fish with the skin taken off for the frying pan.The eyes of fishes generally are so nearly round that they may be used
with good effect as simple microscopes and have considerable magnifying
power.Being continually washed with the element in which they move,
they have no need for winking and the lachrymal duct which supplies
tears to the eyes of most of the animal kingdom is entirely wanting.Whales have no tear glands in their eyes, and the whole order of
Cetacea are tearless.Among domestic animals there is considerable variety of structure in
the eye.The pupil is usually round, but in the small Cats it is long
vertically, and in the Sheep, in fact, in all the cud chewers and many
other grass eaters, the pupil is long horizontally.Insects present a wonderful array of eyes.These are not movable, but
the evident purpose is that there shall be an eye in readiness in
whatever direction the insect may have business.The common Ant has
fifty six-cornered jewels set advantageously in his little head and
so arranged as to take in everything that pertains to the pleasure of
the industrious little creature.As the Ant does not move about with
great rapidity he is less in need of many eyes than the House-fly which
calls into play four thousand brilliant facets, while the Butterfly
is supplied with about seventeen thousand.The most remarkable of all
is the blundering Beetle which bangs his head against the wall with
twenty-five thousand eyes wide open.Then as a nimble Squirrel from the wood
      Ranging the hedges for his filbert food
      Sits pertly on a bough, his brown nuts cracking
      And from the shell the sweet white kernel taking;
    Till with their crooks and bags a sort of boys
    To share with him come with so great a noise
    That he is forced to leave a nut nigh broke,
    And for his life leap to a neighbor oak,
    Thence to a beech, thence to a row of ashes;
    Whilst through the quagmires and red water plashes
    The boys run dabbing through thick and thin.One tears his hose, another breaks his shin;
    This, torn and tattered, hath with much ado
    Got by the briars; and that hath lost his shoe;
    This drops his band; that headlong falls for haste;
    Another cries behind for being last;
    With sticks and stones and many a sounding holloa
    The little fool with no small sport they follow,
    Whilst he from tree to tree, from spray to spray
    Gets to the woods and hides him in his dray.--WILLIAM BROWNE,

Transcriber's note:

Inconsistent punctuation and capitalization are as in the original.Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.Good morning, Miss Jessie," to the little girl on the front seat, who
was looking on with deep interest."Oh, to be sure, I remember," said Miss Carlton, laughing; "come,
introduce the Zouaves, Peter; we are wild to know them!"The boys clustered eagerly about the carriage and a lively chat took
place.The Zouaves, some blushing and bashful, others frank and
confident, and all desperately in love already with pretty little
Jessie, related in high glee their adventures--except the celebrated
court martial--and enlarged glowingly upon the all-important subject of
the grand review.Colonel Freddy, of course, played a prominent part in all this, and with
his handsome face, bright eyes, and frank, gentlemanly ways, needed only
those poor lost curls to be a perfect picture of a soldier.He chattered
away with Miss Lucy, the second sister, and obtained her special promise
that she would plead their cause with Mr.Schermerhorn in case the
united petitions of the corps should fail.The young ladies did not know
of Mrs.Schermerhorn's departure, but Freddy and Peter together coaxed
them to come up to the house "anyhow."The carriage was accordingly
taken into the procession, and followed it meekly to the house; the
Zouaves insisting on being escort, much to the terror of the young
ladies; who were in constant apprehension that the rear rank and the
horses might come to kicks--not to say blows--and the embarrassment of
the coachman; who, as they were constantly stopping unexpectedly to turn
round and talk, didn't know "where to have them," as the saying is.However, they reached their destination in safety before long, and
found Mr.Schermerhorn seated on the piazza.He hastened forward to meet
them, with the cordial greeting of an old friend."Well, old bachelor," said Miss Carlton, gayly, as the young ladies
ascended the steps, "you see we have come to visit you in state, with
the military escort befitting patriotic young ladies who have four
brothers on the Potomac."Gone to Niagara and left me a 'lone lorn creetur;'" said Mr."Basely deserted me when my farming couldn't be
left.But how am I to account for the presence of the military,
mademoiselle?""Really, I beg their pardons," exclaimed Miss Carlton."They have come
on a special deputation to you, Mr.Schermerhorn, so pray don't let us
interrupt business."Thus apostrophised, the boys scampered eagerly up the steps; and Freddy,
a little bashful, but looking as bright as a button, delivered the
following brief oration: "Mr.Schermerhorn: I want--that is, the boys
want--I mean we all want--to have a grand review on Saturday, and ask
our friends to look on.Schermerhorn,
smiling; "but what will become of you good people when I tell you that
I have just received a letter from Mrs.Schermerhorn, asking me to join
her this week instead of next, and bring Peter with me."interrupted Peter; "can't you tell ma
I've joined the army for the war?"No, the army
must give you up, and lose a valuable member, Master Peter; but just
have the goodness to listen a moment.The review shall take place, but
as the camp will have to break up on Saturday instead of Monday, as I
had intended, the performances must come off to-morrow.The boys gave a delighted consent to this arrangement, and now the only
thing which dampened their enjoyment was the prospect of such a speedy
end being put to their camp life.what was the fun for a
fellow to be poked into a stupid watering place, where he must bother to
keep his hair parted down the middle, and a clean collar stiff enough to
choke him on from morning till night?"as Tom indignantly remarked to
George and Will the same evening."The fact is, this sort of thing is
_the_ thing for a _man_ after all!"an opinion in which the other _men_
fully concurred.But let us return to the piazza, where we have left the party.After a
few moments more spent in chatting with Mr.Schermerhorn, it was decided
to accept Colonel Freddy's polite invitation, which he gave with such a
bright little bow, to inspect the camp.You may be sure it was in
apple-pie order, for Jerry, who had taken the Zouaves under his special
charge, insisted on their keeping it in such a state of neatness as only
a soldier ever achieved.The party made an extremely picturesque
group--the gay uniforms of the Zouaves, and light summer dresses of the
ladies, charmingly relieved against the background of trees; while Mr.Schermerhorn's stately six feet, and somewhat portly proportions, quite
reminded one of General Scott; especially among such a small army; in
which George alone quite came up to the regulation "63 inches."Little Jessie ran hither and thither, surrounded by a crowd of adorers,
who would have given their brightest buttons, every "man" of them, to be
the most entertaining fellow of the corps.They showed her the battery
and the stacks of shining guns--made to stand up by Jerry in a wonderful
fashion that the boys never could hope to attain--the inside of all the
tents, and the smoke guard house (Tom couldn't help a blush as he looked
in); and finally, as a parting compliment (which, let me tell you, is
the greatest, in a boy's estimation, that can possibly be paid), Freddy
made her a present of his very largest and most gorgeous "glass agates;"
one of which was all the colors of the rainbow, and the other
patriotically adorned with the Stars and Stripes in enamel.Peter
climbed to the top of the tallest cherry tree, and brought her down a
bough at least a yard and a half long, crammed with "ox hearts;" Harry
eagerly offered to make any number of "stunning baskets" out of the
stones, and in short there never was such a belle seen before."Oh, a'int she jolly!"was the ruling opinion among the Zouaves.A
private remark was also circulated to the effect that "Miss Jessie was
stunningly pretty."The young ladies at last said good-by to the camp; promising faithfully
to send all the visitors they could to the grand review, and drove off
highly entertained with their visit.Schermerhorn decided to take
the afternoon boat for the city and return early Friday morning, and the
boys, left to themselves, began to think of dinner, as it was two
o'clock.A brisk discussion was kept up all dinner time you may be sure,
concerning the event to come off on the morrow."I should like to know, for my part, what we do in a review," said
Jimmy, balancing his fork artistically on the end of his finger, and
looking solemnly round the table."March about,
and form into ranks and columns, and all that first, then do charming
"parade rest," "'der humps!"and the rest of it; and finish off by
firing off our guns, and showing how we can't hit anything by any
possibility!""But I'm sure father won't let us have any powder," said Peter
disconsolately."You can't think how I burnt the end of my nose last
Fourth with powder!It was so sore I couldn't blow it for a week!"The boys all burst out laughing at this dreadful disaster, and George
said, "You weren't lighting it with the end of your nose, were you?""No; but I was stooping over, charging one of my cannon, and I dropped
the 'punk' right in the muzzle somehow, and, would you believe it, the
nasty thing went off and burnt my nose!and father said I shouldn't play
with powder any more, because I might have put out my eyes.""Well, we must take it out in marching, then," said Freddy, with a
tremendous sigh."No, hold on; I'll tell you what we can do!""I have
some 'double headers' left from the Fourth; we might fire them out of
the cannon; they make noise enough, I'm sure.I'll write to my mother
this afternoon and get them."The boys couldn't help being struck with the generosity of this offer,
coming from Tom after their late rather unkind treatment of him; and the
older ones especially were very particular to thank him for his present.As soon as dinner was over, he started for the house to ask Mr.As he hurried along the road, his
bright black eyes sparkling with the happiness of doing a good action,
he heard trotting steps behind him, felt an arm stealing round his neck,
schoolboy fashion, and there was Freddy."I ran after you all the way," he pantingly said."I want to tell you,
dear Tom, how much we are obliged to you for giving us your crackers,
and how sorry we are that we acted so rudely to you the other day.Please forgive us; we all like you so much, and we would feel as mean as
anything to take your present without begging pardon.George, Peter, and
I feel truly ashamed of ourselves every time we think of that abominable
court martial.""There, old fellow, don't say a word more about it!"was the hearty
response; and Tom threw his arm affectionately about his companion."It
was my fault, Freddy, and all because I was mad at poor old Jerry; how
silly!I was sorry for what I said right afterward.""Yes; I'll like you as long as I live!And so
we will leave the two on their walk to the house, and close this
abominably long chapter.THERE are really scarcely words enough in the dictionary properly to
describe the immense amount of drill got through with by the Dashahed
Zouaves between three o'clock that afternoon and twelve, noon, of the
following day.This Friday afternoon was going to be memorable in
history for one of the most splendid reviews on record.They almost ran
poor old Jerry off his legs in their eagerness to go over every possible
variety of exercise known to "Hardee's Tactics," and nearly dislocated
their shoulder blades trying to waggle their elbows backward and forward
all at once when they went at "double quick;" at the same time keeping
the other arm immovably pinioned to their sides.Then that wonderful
operation of stacking the rebellious guns, which obstinately clattered
down nine times and a half out of ten, had to be gone through with, and
a special understanding promulgated in the corps as to when Jerry's
"'der arms!"meant "shoulder arms," and when "order arms" (or bringing
all the muskets down together with a bang); and, in short, there never
was such a busy time seen in camp before.Friday morning dawned, if possible, still more splendidly than any of
the preceding days, with a cool, refreshing breeze, just enough snowy
clouds in the sky to keep off the fiery summer heat in a measure, and
not a headache nor a heartache among the Zouaves to mar the pleasure of
the day.The review was to come off at four o'clock, when the July sun
would be somewhat diminished in warmth, and from some hints that Jerry
let fall, Mrs.Lockitt, and the fat cook, Mrs.Mincemeat, were holding
high council up at the house, over a certain collation to be partaken of
at the end of the entertainments.As the day wore on the excitement of our friends the Zouaves increased.They could hardly either eat their dinners, or sit down for more than a
moment at a time; and when, about three o'clock, Mr.Schermerhorn
entered the busy little camp, he was surrounded directly with a crowd of
eager questioners, all talking at once, and making as much noise as a
colony of rooks."Patience, patience, my good friends!"Schermerhorn, holding
up a finger for silence.Tom, here are your 'double
headers,' with love from your mother.Fred, I saw your father to-day,
and they are all coming down to the review.George, here is a note left
for you in my box at the Post Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in
general--I have one piece of advice to give you.Get dressed quietly,
and then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end
of the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can
help at present;" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,
under strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which
suddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as
they could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four
o'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after
another, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and
soon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown
reason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little
trilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,
folded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to
do with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in
equal danger of irremediable "mussing," as she fidgetted about on the
carriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs
in the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best
view of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the
white tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a
magnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the
lawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental
grounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view
was bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could
be seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit
of regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice
was heard shouting, "Are ye all ready now?and to
the melodious notes of "Dixie," performed by the band, which was
stationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry
marching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious
mandates as, "Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the
house!The boys hurrahed, the girls clapped their hands, ladies and
gentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs; while the Dashahed
Zouaves, too soldierly _now_ to grin, drew up in a long line, and stood
like statues, without so much as winking.And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,
while Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:

"To the rear--open order!"and the rear rank straightway fell back;
executing, in fact, that wonderful "tekkinapesstoth'rare" which had
puzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those
other wonderful orders:

          "P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,
with such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond
measure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on
each side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,
declared "It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!"a
celebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened
his pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at
last produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this
volume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they
would give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to
the gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: "DOUBLE-QUICK."]After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the
regiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,
formed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called "breaking into
platoons," showed how to "wheel on the right flank," and all manner of
other mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the
order, they started at "double quick" (which is the most comical
tritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the
lawn, round the great elm, up hill again full speed, and in a moment
more were drawn up in unbroken lines before the house, and standing once
again like so many statues.Round after round of applause greeted the
Zouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off
their saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in
return, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the
little remaining breath they had after the "double quick."Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of
their rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went
through some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and
jump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to
rather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, "Close up
in ranks to dismiss," when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and
Jessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,
"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony
to go through with."The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could
be coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a
great hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came
tripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over
her snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and
blue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils
encircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It
was made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was
painted an American eagle, and on the other the words "Dashahed
Zouaves," surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced
to the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little
tremulous, but very distinct, she said:

          "COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:

          "I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,
          on the success you have achieved.You have shown
          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a
          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you
          the colors of your regiment!"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are
          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you
          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath
          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down
          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your
          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name
          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as
he advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our
little Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member
of the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have
thought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with
the right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice
that he responded:

          "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

          "I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the
          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,
          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we
          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness
          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we
          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we
          fight, they shall never float over a retreating
          battalion!"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his
hand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began
playing a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some
lady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss
Lucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:

          "We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--
          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;
          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--
          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,
          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night
          And the standard that guides us forever shall be
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"A handful of living--an army of dead,
          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;
          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain
          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,
          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear
          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;
          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,
          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,
          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,
          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the
band struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves
marching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a
bountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner
of "goodies," as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on
the sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a
large flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the
other officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took
their seats.The other children found places around the table, and a
merrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively
airs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,
that nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement
among the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in
such fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves
their flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the
supper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the
beginning of the week.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,
of getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good
friends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a
pleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was
quite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as
the company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the
scene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and
gentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly
pretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its
centre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all
crowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and
admiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and
listening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or
grown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,
central figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful
for the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had
scarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no
one else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he
moved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and
affection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier
beat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the
young Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental
colors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes
them out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once
more the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with
quivering lip and flashing eye, "Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,
I'll live and die a soldier!"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful
planet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the
camp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly
ached; and then they all shook hands with "dear" Jessie, as Charley was
heard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her
soft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she
certainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the
good people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving
their handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and
so, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended
the very end of

                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that "day of disaster," when Camp McClellan
must be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,
thought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five
days, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very
shortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the
breaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by
the early afternoon boat."Is it possible we have been here a week?"exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat
down to breakfast."It seems as if we had only come yesterday.""What a jolly time it has been!""I don't want
to go to Newport a bit."To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!"added Tom, with a little
blush."I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's
one too many rebels in the family."cried George Chadwick; "the Pringles are a first rate
family; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!"and George gave
Tom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite
brought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and
proceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.They were not
very scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the
business was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and
then jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,
and under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and
placed them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving
them to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;
for, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own
affairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when
it comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious
little wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself
out of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black
Canadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall
by a young lady in a saucy "pork pie" straw hat, who was driving--no
other than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly
surrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, "Jessie
begged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her."Really," repeated Freddy; "but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just
in time to see us off.""You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all," said George;
"you will see the tents come down with a run presently."As he spoke, the donkey
cart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and
prepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,
two of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from
one corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which
supported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated "Now!"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,
just as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the
first one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was
detached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and
charged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this
purpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in
his hands.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it
rapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, "Come, boys, are you ready?Jump in,
then, it is time to start for the boat."The boys turned and saw the
carriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to
convey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm
was rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony
chaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to
adore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and
old Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate "Good-by, my little
Colonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as
long as he lives."It would have seemed like insulting the old man to
offer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome
gilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of
the regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of
"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike."As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond
the capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on
riding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of
carrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,
with that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with
three ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the
regiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to
see the last of "dear Jessie," until the locusts hid them from sight,
when they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn
accompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red
brickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the
lovely green of the country.Schermerhorn's advice, the party
took possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be
waiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers
street, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the
depot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they
had to travel all the way to Buffalo with our young friend in this
unusual guise; but, as people had become used to seeing soldiers
parading about in uniform, they didn't seem particularly surprised,
whereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth
avenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine
style, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping
at the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one
and another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon
as possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they
marched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, "I tell you
what, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me
go to West Point as soon as I leave school!I must be a soldier--I
can't think of anything else!""That's just what I mean to do!"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; "and,
Fred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your
regiment, won't you?"answered Freddy; "but you're the oldest, Tom,
and, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget
me when you come to your command!"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to
come back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang
the bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of
eminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in
hand, saying, "Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll
never leave the Union!"and the last words he heard Tom say were, "No,
by George, _never_!"*       *       *       *       *

And now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history
of Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends
Dr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had
many a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the
beautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed
in every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and
learn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to
Baltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join
Freddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger
in after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the
field, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant
young friend,

                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of "Colonel
Freddy," and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed
and breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off
their seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when
anything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful
story that was seen "before it was printed," and a great many "oh's" and
"ah's" testified to their appreciation of the gallant "Dashahed
Zouaves."They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true
story of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had
been read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang
up once more, exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,
mayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?"cried his sister; "I wish I had been Jessie; what a
pity it wasn't all true!""And what if I should tell you," said their mother, laughing, "that a
little bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was
wonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?""Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more
questions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time
they paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg
her to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about
it.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at
last one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more
stories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,
which looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; "Aunt Fanny's
daughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!"and dressing himself in a
double quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,
forgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of
lightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;
shouting, "Come, get up!here's another Sock story for
us!"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's
stockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to
their places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the
wrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the
whole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored
maxim, "The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;" George, meanwhile,
performing a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his
father opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down
stairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to
examine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was
again a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read
"GERMAN SOCKS.""These must be more stories like that
dear 'Little White Angel.'"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the
first story, it was found to be called, "God's Pensioners;" and
commenced, "It was a cold--" but stop!This book was to be devoted
to "Colonel Freddy;" but if you will only go to Mr.Leavitt's, the
publishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock
Stories.*       *       *       *       *

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Red, White, Blue Socks.But in spite of all these precautions I find so much prejudice against
extracted honey, growing out of the ignorance of the public with regard to
this sweet, ignorance equaled only by the ignorance in regard to bees
themselves, that the sale of such honey has been very slow; so slow that
while my comb honey is reduced at this date to about 150 pounds, I have
several ten-gallon kegs of pure white honey still on hand.Especially is there a prejudice against candied honey, though that is an
absolute test of purity, and it can be readily liquified, as Mrs.When I say that it is an absolute test of purity I mean
that all honey that candies evenly is pure, though some of the best honey
I have ever had never candied at all.In one case I knew the honey to
candy in the combs of a new swarm early in autumn; but some seasons,
particularly very dry ones, it will hardly candy at all.This difference
seems to be due to the varying proportion of natural glucose, which will
crystallize, and levulose, or mellose, which will not crystallize.Manufactured glucose will not crystallize; and some of our largest honey
merchants, even the Thurbers, of New York, have mixed artificial glucose
with honey to avoid loss by the ignorant prejudice of the public.CAMM., MORGAN CO., ILL.South'n Wisconsin Bee-keepers' Ass'n.The bee-keepers met in Janesville, Wis., on the 4th inst., and organized a

Loaned netting investors 7 per cent.In a private letter to the editor of THE PRAIRIE FARMER Dr.L. S.
Pennington, of Whiteside County, Illinois, says: "Many thanks for your
instructive articles on Silk Culture.Could the many miles of Osage orange
found in this State be utilized for this purpose, the industry would give
employment to thousands of dependent women and children, by which means
they could make themselves, at least in part, self-supporting.I hope that
you will continue to publish and instruct your many readers on this
subject."Anent this subject we find the following by Prof.C. V. Riley in a late
issue of the American Naturalist:

"There is a strong disposition on the part of those who look for making
money by the propagation and sale of mulberry trees, to underrate the use
of Osage orange as silk-worm food.We have thoroughly demonstrated, by the
most careful tests, on several occasions, that when Maclura aurantiaca is
properly used for this purpose, the resulting silk loses nothing in
quantity or quality, and we have now a strain of Sericaria mori that has
been fed upon the plant for twelve consecutive years without
deterioration.There has been, perhaps, a slight loss of color which, if
anything, must be looked upon as an advantage.It is more than likely, how
ever, that the different races will differ in their adaptability to the
Maclura, and that for the first year the sudden transition to Maclura from
Morus, upon which the worms have been fed for centuries, may result in
some depreciation.Virion des Lauriers, at the silk farm at Genito,
has completed some experiments on the relative value of the two plants,
which he details in the opening number of the Silk-Grower's Guide and
Manufacturer's Gazette.The race
known as the "Var" was fed throughout on mulberry leaves.The "Pyrenean"
and "Cevennes" worms were fed throughout on leaves and branches of Osage
orange, while the "Milanese" worms were fed on Maclura up to the second
molt and then changed to mulberry leaves.At the close examples of each
variety of cocoons were sent to the Secretary of the Silk Board at Lyons,
and appraised by him The Maclura-fed cocoons were rated at 85 cents per
pound, those raised partly on Osage and partly on mulberry at 95 cents per
pound, and those fed entirely on mulberry at $1.11 per pound.des Lauriers thinks, seems to show that the difference between
Maclura and Morus as silk-worm food is some 'twenty-five to thirty per
cent in favor of the latter, while it is evident that the leaf of the
Osage orange can be used with some advantage during the first two ages of
the worms, thus allowing the mulberry tree to grow more leafy for feeding
during the last three ages.'The experiment, although interesting, is not
conclusive, from the simple fact that different races were used in the
different tests and not the same races, so that the result may have been
due, to a certain extent, to race and not to food."A writer in an English medical journal declares that the raising of the
head of the bed, by placing under each leg a block of the thickness of two
bricks, is an effective remedy for cramps.Patients who have suffered at
night, crying aloud with pain, have found this plan to afford immediate,
certain, and permanent relief.California stands fifth in the list of States in the manufacture of salt,
and is the only State in the Union where the distillation of salt from sea
water is carried on to any considerable extent.This industry has
increased rapidly during the last twenty years.The production has risen
from 44,000 bushels in 1860 to upwards of 880,000 bushels in 1883.The amount of attention given to purely technical education in Saxony is
shown by the fact that there are now in that kingdom the following
schools: A technical high school in Dresden, a technical State institute
at Chemnitz, and art schools in Dresden and Leipzig, also four builders'
schools, two for the manufacture of toys, six for shipbuilders, three for
basket weavers, and fourteen for lace making.Besides these there are the
following trade schools supported by different trades, foundations,
endowments, and districts: Two for decorative painting, one for
watchmakers, one for sheet metal workers, three for musical instrument
makers, one for druggists (not pharmacy), twenty-seven for weaving, one
for machine embroidery, two for tailors, one for barbers and hairdressers,
three for hand spinning, six for straw weaving, three for wood carving,
four for steam boiler heating, six for female handiwork.There are,
moreover, seventeen technical advanced schools, two for gardeners, eight
agricultural, and twenty-six commercial schools.The Patrie reports, with apparent faith, an invention of Dr.Raydt, of
Hanover, who claims to have developed fully the utility of carbonic acid
as a motive agent.Under the pressure of forty atmospheres this acid is
reduced to a liquid state, and when the pressure is removed it evaporates
and expands into a bulk 500 times as great as that it occupied before.It
is by means of this double process that the Hanoverian chemist proposes to
obtain such important benefits from the agent he employs.A quantity of
the fluid is liquified, and then stowed away in strong metal receptacles,
securely fastened and provided with a duct and valve.By opening the valve
free passage is given to the gas, which escapes with great force, and may
be used instead of steam for working in a piston.One of the principal
uses to which it has been put is to act as a temporary motive power for
fire engines.Iron cases of liquified carbonic acid are fitted on to the
boiler of the machine, and are always ready for use, so that while steam
is being got up, and the engines can not yet be regularly worked in the
usual way, the piston valves can be supplied with acid gas.There is,
however, another remarkable object to which the new agent can be directed,
and to which it has been recently applied in some experiments conducted at
Kiel.This is the floating of sunken vessels by means of artificial
bladders.It has been found that a bladder or balloon of twenty feet
diameter, filled with air, will raise a mass of over 100 tons.Hitherto
these floats have been distended by pumping air into them through pipes
from above by a cumbrous and tedious process, but Dr.Raydt merely affixes
a sufficient number of his iron gas-accumulators to the necks of the
floats to be used, and then by releasing the gas fills them at once with
the contents.DAIRY SUPPLIES, Etc.[Illustration of a swing churn]

  In woman than to study _household_ good.--_Milton._


How He Ventilated the Cellar.The effect of foul air upon milk, cream, and butter was often alluded to
at the Dairymen's meeting at DeKalb.A great bane to the dairyman is
carbonic acid gas.In ill ventilated cellars it not only has a pernicious
effect upon milk and its products, but it often renders the living
apartments unhealthful, and brings disease and death to the family.W. D. Hoard, President of the Northwestern
Dairymen's Association, related the following incident showing how easily
cellars may be ventilated and rendered fit receptacles for articles of
food:

"In the city of Fort Atkinson, where I do reside, Mr.Clapp, the president
of the bank told me that for twenty years he had been unable to keep any
milk or butter or common food of the family in the cellar.I went and
looked at it, and saw gathered on the sleepers above large beads of
moisture, and then knew what was the matter.Wilkins is here and will tell you in a few
moments how to remedy this difficulty, and make your cellar a clean and
wholesome apartment of your house.'I went down and got the professor, and
he went up and looked at the cellar, and he says, 'for ten dollars I will
put you in possession of a cellar that will be clean and wholesome.'He
went to work and took a four-inch pipe, made of galvanized iron, soldered
tightly at the joints, passing it down the side of the cellar wall until
it came within two inches of the bottom of the cellar, turned a square
elbow at the top of the wall, carried it under the house, under the
kitchen, up through the kitchen floor and into the kitchen chimney, about
four feet above where the kitchen stovepipe entered.You know the kitchen
stove in all families is in operation about three times a day.The heat
from this kitchen stove acting on the column of air in that little pipe
caused a vacuum, and nature abhors a vacuum, and the result was that in
twenty-four hours that little pipe had drawn the entire foul air out of
the cellar, and he has now a perfect cellar.I drop this hint to show you
that it is within easy reach of every one, for the sum of only about ten
dollars, to have a perfectly ventilated cellar.This carbonic acid gas is
very heavy.It collects in the cellar and you can not get it out unless
you dip it out like water, or pump it out; and it becomes necessary to
apply something to it that shall operate in this way."This is a matter of such importance, and yet so little thought about, that
we had designed having an illustration made to accompany this article, but
conclude the arrangment is so simple that any one can go to work and adapt
it to the peculiar construction of his own house, and we hope thousands
will make use of Mr.As far as the nuptial ceremony itself was concerned, the Romans were in
the habit of celebrating it with many imposing rites and customs, some of
which are still in use in this country.As soon, therefore, as the
sooth-sayer had taken the necessary omens, the ceremony was commenced by a
sheep being sacrificed to Juno, under whose special guardianship marriage
was supposed to rest.The fleece was next laid upon two chairs, on which
the bride and bridegroom sat, over whom prayers were then said.At the
conclusion of the service the bride was led by three young men to the home
of her husband.She generally took with her a distaff and spindle filled
with wool, indicative of the first work in her new married life--spinning
fresh garments for her husband.The threshold of the house was gaily decorated with flowers and garlands;
and in order to keep out infection it was anointed with certain unctuous
perfumes.As a preservative, moreover, against sorcery and evil
influences, it was disenchanted by various charms.After being thus
prepared, the bride was lifted over the threshold, it being considered
unlucky for her to tread across it on first entering her husband's house.The musicians then struck up their music, and the company sang their
"Epithalamium."The keys of the house were then placed in the young wife's
hands, symbolic of her now being mistress.A cake, too, baked by the
vestal virgins, which had been carried before her in the procession from
the place of the marriage ceremony to the husband's home, was now divided
among the guests.To enhance the merriment of the festive occasion, the
bridegroom threw nuts among the boys, who then, as nowadays enjoyed
heartily a grand scramble.Once upon a time there lived a certain man and wife, and their name--well,
I think it must have been Smith, Mr.Smith said to her husband: "John, I really think we must
have the stove up in the sitting-room."Smith from behind his
newspaper answered "Well."Three hundred and forty-six times did Mr.Smith repeat this conversation, and the three hundred and
forty-seventh time Mr.Smith added: "I'll get Brown to help me about it
some day."It is uncertain how long the matter would have rested thus, had not Mrs.Smith crossed the street and asked neighbor Brown to come over and help
her husband set up a stove, and as she was not his wife he politely
consented and came at once.With a great deal of grunting, puffing, and banging, accompanied by some
words not usually mentioned in polite society, the two men at last got the
stove down from the attic.Smith had placed the zinc in its proper
position, and they put the stove way to one side of it, but of course that
didn't matter.Then they proceeded to put up the stovepipe.Smith pushed the knee
into the chimney, and Mr.The
next thing was to get the two pieces to come together.They pushed and
pulled, they yanked and wrenched, they rubbed off the blacking onto their
hands, they uttered remarks, wise and otherwise.Smith that a hammer was just the thing that
was needed, and he went for one.Brown improved the opportunity to
wipe the perspiration from his noble brow, totally oblivious of the fact
that he thereby ornamented his severe countenance with several landscapes
done in stove blacking.The hammer didn't seem to be just the thing that
was needed, after all.Smith pounded until he had spoiled the shape of
the stovepipe, and still the pesky thing wouldn't go in, so he became
exasperated and threw away the hammer.Brown's toe, and
that worthy man ejaculated--well, it's no matter what he ejaculated.Smith replied to his ejaculation, and then Mr.Smith, after making a
great deal of commotion, finally succeeded in getting the pipe into place,
that he was perfectly savage to everybody for the rest of the day, and
that the next time he and Brown met on the street both were looking
intently the other way.It came to pass in the course of the winter
that the pipe needed cleaning out.Smith dreaded the ordeal, both for
her own sake and her husband's.It happened that the kitchen was presided
over by that rarest of treasures, a good-natured, competent hired girl.This divinity proposed that they dispense with Mr.Smith's help in
cleaning out the pipe, and Mrs.Smith, with a sigh of relief, consented.They carefully pulled the pipe apart, and, holding the pieces in a
horizontal position that no soot might fall on the carpet, carried it into
the yard.After they had swept out the pipe and carried it back they attempted to
put it up.That must have been an unusually obstinate pipe, for it
steadily refused to go together.Smith and her housemaid
were sufficiently broad to grasp this fact after a few trials; therefore
they did not waste their strength in vain attempts, but rested, and in an
exceedingly un-masculine way held a consultation.The girl went for a
hammer, and brought also a bit of board.She placed this on the top of the
pipe, raised her hammer, Mrs.Smith held the pipe in place below, two
slight raps, and, lo, it was done.This story is true, with the exception of the
names and a few other unimportant items.I say, and will maintain it, that
as a general thing a woman has more brains and patience and less stupidity
than a man.I challenge any one to prove the contrary.--_N.In the course of a lecture on the resources of New Brunswick, Professor
Brown, of the Ontario Agricultural College, told the following story by an
Arabian writer:

"I passed one day by a very rude and beautifully situated hamlet in a vast
forest, and asked a savage whom I saw how long it had been there.'It is
indeed an old place,' replied he.'We know it has stood there for 100 years
as the hunting home of the great St.John, but how long previous to that
we do not know.'"One century afterward, as I passed by the same place, I found a busy
little city reaching down to the sea, where ships were loading timber for
distant lands.On asking one of the inhabitants how long this had
flourished, he replied: 'I am looking to the future years, and not to what
has gone past, and have no time to answer such questions.'"On my return there 100 years afterward, I found a very smoky and
wonderfully-populous city, with many tall chimneys, and asked one of the
inhabitants how long it had been founded.'It is indeed a mighty city,'
replied he.'We know not how long it has existed, and our ancestors there
on this subject are as ignorant as ourselves.'"Another century after that as I passed by the same place, I found a much
greater city than before, but could not see the tall chimneys, and the air
was pure as crystal; the country to the north and the east and the west,
was covered with noble mansions and great farms, full of many cattle and
sheep.I demanded of a peasant, who was reaping grain on the sands of the
sea-shore, how long ago this change took place?'In sooth, a strange
question!''This ground and city have never been different
from what you now behold them.''Were there not of old,' said I,'many
great manufacturers in this city?''Never,' answered he,'so far as we
have seen, and never did our fathers speak to us of any such.'"On my return there, 100 years afterward, I found the city was built
across the sea east-ward into the opposite country; there were no horses,
and no smoke of any kind came from the dwellings."The inhabitants were traveling through the air on wires which stretched
far into the country on every side, and the whole land was covered with
many mighty trees and great vineyards, so that the noble mansions could
not be seen for the magnitude of the fruit thereof."Lastly, on coming back again, after an equal lapse of time, I could not
perceive the slightest vestige of the city.I inquired of a very old and
saintly man, who appeared to be under deep emotion, and who stood alone
upon the spot, how long it had been destroyed.'Is this a question,' said
he, 'from a man like you?Know ye not that cities are not now part of the
human economy?Every one travels through the air on wings of electricity,
and lives in separate dwellings scattered all over the land; the ships of
the sea are driven by the same power, and go above or below as found to be
best for them.In the cultivation of the soil,' said he, 'neither horse
nor steam-power are employed; the plow is not known, nor are fertilizers
of any more value in growing the crops of the field.Electricity is
carried under the surface of every farm and all over-head like a net; when
the inhabitants require rain for any particular purpose, it is drawn down
from the heavens by similar means.The influence of electricity has
destroyed all evil things, and removed all diseases from among men and
beasts, and every living thing upon the earth.All things have changed,
and what was once the noble city of my name is to become the great meeting
place of all the leaders of science throughout the whole world.'"Gunkettle, as she spanked the baby in her calm, motherly
way, "it's a perfect shame, Mr.G., that you never bring me home anything
to read!I might as well be shut up in a lunatic asylum.""I think so, too," responded the unfeeling man.Gunkettle, as she gave the baby a marble to
swallow, to stop its noise, "have magazines till they can't rest.""Oh, yes; a horrid old report of the fruit interests of Michigan; lots of
news in that!"and she sat down on the baby with renewed vigor."I'm sure it's plum full of currant news of the latest dates," said the
miserable man.Gunkettle retorted that she wouldn't give a fig for a
whole library of such reading, when 'apple-ly the baby shrieked loud
enough to drown all other sounds, and peace was at once restored.Mouce Traps and Other Sweetemetes.The following advertisement is copied from the Fairfield Gazette of

  A SONNET ON A BONNET.A film of lace and a droop of feather,
  With sky-blue ribbons to knot them together;
  A facing (at times) of bronze-brown tresses,
  Into whose splendor each furbelow presses;
  Two strings of blue to fall in a tangle,
  And chain of pink chin In decorous angle;
  The tip of the plume right artfully twining
  Where a firm neck steals under the lining;
  And the curls and braids, the plume and the laces.Circle about the shyest of faces,
  Bonnet there is not frames dimples sweeter!Bonnet there is not that shades eyes completer!Fated is he that but glances upon it,
  Sighing to dream of that face in the bonnet.--_Winnifred Wise Jenks._

  LITTLE DILLY-DALLY.I don't believe you ever
   Knew any one so silly
  As the girl I'm going to tell about--
   A little girl named Dilly,
     Dilly-dally Dilly,
      Oh, she is very slow,
     She drags her feet
     Along the street,
      And dilly-dallies so!She's always late to breakfast
   Without a bit of reason,
  For Bridget rings and rings the bell
   And wakes her up in season.Dilly-dally Dilly,
      How can you be so slow?Why don't you try
     To be more spry,
      And not dilly-dally so?'Tis just the same at evening;
   And it's really quite distressing
  To see the time that Dilly wastes
   In dreaming and undressing.Dilly-dally Dilly
      Is always in a huff;
     If you hurry her
     Or worry her
      She says, "There's time enough."Since she's neither sick nor helpless,
   It is quite a serious matter
  That she should be so lazy that
   We still keep scolding at her.Dilly-dally Dilly,
      It's very wrong you know,
     To do no work
     That you can shirk,
      And dilly-dally so.Old "Uncle Jim," of Stonington, Conn., ought to have a whole drawer to
himself, for nothing short of it could express the easy-going enlargement
of his mind in narratives.Uncle Jim was a retired sea captain, sealer,
and whaler, universally beloved and respected for his lovely disposition
and genuine good-heartedness, not less than for the moderation of his
statements and the truthful candor of his narrations.It happened that one
of the Yale Professors, who devoted himself to ethnological studies, was
interested in the Patagonians, and very much desired information as to the
alleged gigantic stature of the race.A scientific friend, who knew the
Stonington romancer, told the Professor that he could no doubt get
valuable information from Uncle Jim, a Captain who was familiar with all
the region about Cape Horn.And the Professor, without any hint about
Uncle Jim's real ability, eagerly accompanied his friend to make the
visit.Uncle Jim was found in one of his usual haunts, and something like
the following ethnological conversation ensued:

Professor--They tell me, Capt.Pennington, that you have been a good deal
in Patagonia.Uncle Jim--Made thirty or forty voyages there, sir.Professor--And I suppose you know something about the Patagonians and
their habits?Uncle Jim--Know all about 'em, sir.Know the Patagonians, sir, all, all of
'em, as well as I know the Stonington folks.Professor--I wanted to ask you, Captain, about the size of the
Patagonians--whether they are giants, as travelers have reported?Uncle Jim--No, sir--shaking his head slowly, and speaking with the modest
tone of indifference--no, sir, they are not.(It was quite probable that
the Captain never had heard the suggestion before).The height of the
Patagonian, sir, is just five feet nine inches and a half.Professor--How did you ascertain this fact, Captain?Uncle Jim--Measured 'em, sir--measured 'em.One day when the mate and I
were ashore down there, I called up a lot of the Patagonians, and the mate
and I measured about 500 of them, and every one of them measured five feet
nine inches and a half--that's their exact height.But, Captain, don't you suppose there
were giants there long ago, in the former generations?Uncle Jim--Not a word of truth in it, sir--not a word.I'd heard that
story and I thought I'd settle it.I satisfied myself there was nothing in
it.Professor--But how could you know that they used not to be giants?Mightn't the former race have been giants?Uncle Jim--Impossible, sir, impossible.Uncle Jim--Dug 'em up, sir--dug 'em up speaking with more than usual
moderation.The next voyage, I took the bo'sen and
went ashore; we dug up 275 old Patagonians and measured 'em.They all
measured exactly five feet nine inches and a half; no difference in
'em--men, women, and all ages just the same.Five feet nine inches and a
half is the natural height of a Patagonian.Not a word of truth in the stories about giants, sir.--_Harper's
Magazine_."Nice child, very nice child," observed an old gentleman, crossing the
aisle and addressing the mother of the boy who had just hit him in the eye
with a wad of paper."None of your business," replied the youngster, taking aim at another
passenger."Fine boy," smiled the old man, as the parent regarded her offspring with
pride.shouted the youngster, with a giggle at his own wit."I thought so," continued the old man, pleasantly."If you had given me
three guesses at it, that would have been the first one I would have
struck on.Now, Puddin', you can blow those things pretty straight, can't
you?"squealed the boy, delighted at the compliment."See me take
that old fellow over there!""Try it on the old woman I
was sitting with.She has boys of her own, and she won't mind.""Can you hit the lady for the gentleman, Johnny?"Johnny drew a bead and landed the pellet on the end of the old woman's
nose.But she did mind it, and, rising in her wrath, soared down on the
small boy like a blizzard.She put him over the line, reversed him, ran
him backward till he didn't know which end of him was front, and finally
dropped him into the lap of the scared mother, with a benediction whereof
the purport was that she'd be back in a moment and skin him alive."She didn't seem to like it, Puddin'," smiled the gentleman, softly."She's a perfect stranger to me, but I understand she is a matron of
truants' home, and I thought she would like a little fun; but I was
mistaken."And the old gentleman sighed sweetly as he went back to his seat.The discovery of the alphabet is at once the triumph, the instrument and
the register of the progress of our race.The oldest abecedarium in
existence is a child's alphabet on a little ink-bottle of black ware found
on the site of Cere, one of the oldest of the Greek settlements in Central
Italy, certainly older than the end of the sixth century B. C. The
Phoenician alphabet has been reconstructed from several hundred
inscriptions.The "Moabite Stone" has yielded the honor of being the most
ancient of alphabetic records to the bronze plates found in Lebanon in
1872, fixed as of the tenth or eleventh century, and therefore the
earliest extant monuments of the Semitic alphabet.The lions of Nineveh
and an inscribed scarab found at Khorsabad have furnished other early
alphabets; while scarabs and cylinders, seals and gems, from Babylon and
Nineveh, with some inscriptions, are the scanty records of the first epoch
of the Phoenician alphabet.For the second period, a sarcophagus found in
1855, with an inscription of twenty-two lines, has tasked the skill of
more than forty of the most eminent Semitic scholars of the day, and the
literature connected with it is overwhelming.An unbroken series of coins
extending over seven centuries from 522 B. C. to 153 A. D., Hebrew
engraved gems, the Siloam inscription discovered in Jerusalem in 1880,
early Jewish coins, have each and all found special students whose
successive progress is fully detailed by Taylor.The Aramaean alphabet
lived only for seven or eight centuries; but from it sprang the scripts of
five great faiths of Asia and the three great literary alphabets of the
East.Nineveh and its public records supply most curious revelations of
the social life and commercial transactions of those primitive times.Loans, leases, notes, sales of houses, slaves, etc., all dated, show the
development of the alphabet.The early Egyptian inscriptions show which
alphabet was there in the reign of Xerxes.Fragments on stone preserved in
old Roman walls in Great Britain, Spain, France, and Jerusalem, all supply
early alphabets.Alphabets have been affected by religious controversies, spread by
missionaries, and preserved in distant regions by holy faith, in spite of
persecution and perversion.The Arabic alphabet, next in importance after
the great Latin alphabet, followed in eighty years the widespread religion
of Mohammed; and now the few Englishmen who can read and speak it are
astonished to learn that it is collaterally related to our own alphabet,
and that both can be traced back to the primitive Phoenician source.Greece alone had forty local alphabets, reduced by careful study to about
half a dozen generic groups, characterized by certain common local
features, and also by political connection.Of the oldest "a, b, c's" found in Italy, several were scribbled by
school-boys on Pompeian walls, six in Greek, four in Oscan, four in Latin;
others were scratched on children's cups, buried with them in their
graves, or cut or painted for practice on unused portions of mortuary
slabs.The earliest was found as late as 1882, a plain vase of black ware
with an Etruscan inscription and a syllabary or spelling exercise, and the
Greek alphabet twice repeated."Pa, I have signed the pledge," said a little boy to his father, on coming
home one evening; "will you help me keep it?""Well, I have brought a copy of the pledge; will you sign it, papa?"What could I do when my brother-officers
called--the father had been in the army--if I was a teetotaler?""Well, you won't ask me to pass the bottle, papa?""You are quite a fanatic, my child; but I promise not to ask you to touch
it."Some weeks after that two officers called in to spend the evening."Have you any more of that prime Scotch ale?""No," said he; "I have not, but I shall get some.Here, Willie, run to the
store, and tell them to send some bottles up."The boy stood before his father respectfully, but did not go."Come, Willie; why, what's the matter?He went, but came
back presently without any bottles."I asked them for it at the store, and they put it upon the counter, but I
could not touch it.don't be angry; I told them to send it up,
but I could not touch it myself!"The father was deeply moved, and turning to his brother-officers, he said:

"Gentlemen, do you hear that?When the ale comes
you may drink it, but not another drop shall be drank in my house, and not
another drop shall pass my lips.Willie, have you your temperance pledge?"And the boy was back with it in a moment.The father signed it and the
little fellow clung round his father's neck with delight.The ale came,
but not one drank, and the bottles stood on the table untouched.Children, sign the pledge, and ask your parents to help you keep it.Don't
touch the bottle, and try to keep others from touching it.Stock Farms FOR SALE; one of the very best in Central Illinois, the

THE PRAIRIE FARMER is the Cheapest and Best Agricultural Paper published.He owned the farm--at least 'twas thought
   He owned, since he lived upon it,--
  And when he came there, with him brought
   The men whom he had hired to run it.He had been bred to city life
   And had acquired a little money;
  But, strange conceit, himself and wife
   Thought farming must be something funny.He did not work himself at all,
   But spent his time in recreation--
  In pitching quoits and playing ball,
   And such mild forms of dissipation.He kept his "rods" and trolling spoons,
   His guns and dogs of various habits,--
  While in the fall he hunted <DW53>s,
   And in the winter skunks and rabbits.His hired help were quick to learn

FRANK DOBB'S WIVES."The great trouble with my son," old Dobb observed to me once, "is that he
is a genius."And the old gentleman sighed and looked with melancholy eyes at the
picture on the genius's easel.It was a clever picture, but everything
Frank Dobb did was clever, from his painting to his banjo playing.Clever
was the true name for it, for of substantial merit it possessed none.He
had begun to paint without learning to draw, and he could pick a tune out
of any musical instrument extant without ever having mastered the
mysteries of notes.He talked the most graceful of airy nothings, and
could not cover a page of note paper without his orthography going lame,
and all the rest of his small acquirements and accomplishments were
proportionately shallow and incomplete.Paternal partiality laid it to his
being too gifted to study, but the cold logic, which no ties of
consanguinity influenced, ascribed it to laziness.Frank was, indeed, the idlest and best-natured fellow in the world.You
never saw him busy, angry, or out of spirits.He painted a little,
thrummed his guitar a little longer or rattled a tune off on his piano,
smoked and read a great deal, and flirted still more, all in the same
deliberate and easy-going way.Any excuse was sufficient to absolve him
from serious work.So he lead a pleasant, useless life, with Dobb senior
to pay the bills.He had the handsomest studio in New York, a studio for one of Ouida's
heroes to luxuriate in.If the encouragement of picturesque surroundings
could have made a painter of him he would have been a master.The fame of
his studio, and the fact that he did not need the money, made his pictures
sell.He was quite a lion in society, and it was regarded as a favor to be
asked to call on him.He was the beau ideal of the artist of romance, and
was accorded a romantic eminence accordingly.So, with his pictures to
provide him with pocket money, and his father to see to the rest, he lived
the life of a young prince, feted and flattered and spoiled, artistically
despised by all the serious workers who knew him, and hated by some who
envied him the commercial success he had no necessity for, but esteemed by
most of us as a good fellow and his own worst enemy.Frank married his first wife while Dobb senior was still at the helm of
his own affairs.She was a charming little woman whose acquaintance he had
made when she visited his studio with a party of friends.She had not a
penny, but he made a draft upon "the governor," as he called him, and the
happy pair digested their honeymoon in Europe.They were absent six
months, during which time he did not set brush to canvas.Then they
returned, as he fancifully termed it, to go to work.He commenced the old life as if he had never been married.The familiar
sound of pipes and beer, and supper after the play, often with young
ladies who had been assisting in the representation on the stage, was
traveled as if there had been no Mrs.Dobb at home in the flat old Dobb
provided.Frank's expenditures on himself were as lavish as they had been
in his bachelor days.As little Brown said, it was lucky that Mrs.Dobb
had a father-in-law to buy her dinner for her.She rarely came to her
husband's studio, because he claimed that it interfered with the course of
business.He had invented a fiction that she was too weak to endure the
strain of society, and so he took her into it as little as possible.In
brief, married by the caprice of a selfish man, the poor little woman
lived through a couple of neglected years, and then died of a malady as
nearly akin to a broken heart as I can think of, while Frank was making a
trip to the Bahamas on the yacht of his friend Munnybagge, of the Stock
Exchange.He had set out on the voyage ostensibly to make studies, for he was a
marine painter, on the principle, probably, that marines are easiest to
paint.When he came back and found his wife dead, he announced that he
would move his studio to Havana for the purpose of improving his art.He
did so, putting off his mourning suit the day after he left New York and
not putting it on again, as the evidence of creditable witnesses on the
steamer and in Havana has long since proved.His son's callousness was a savage stab in old Dobb's heart.A little,
mild-looking old gentleman, without a taint of selfishness or suspicion in
his own nature, he had not seen the effect of his indulgence of him on his
son till his brutal disregard for his first duty as a man had told him of
it.The old man had appreciated and loved his daughter-in-law.In
proportion as he had discovered her unhappiness and its just cause, he had
lost his affection for his son.I hear that there was a terrible scene
when Frank came home, a week after his wife had been buried.He claimed to
have missed the telegram announcing her death to him at Nassau, but
Munnybagge had already told some friends that he had got the dispatch in
time for the steamer, but had remained over till the next one, because he
had a flirtation on hand with little Gonzales, the Cuban heiress, and old
Dobb had heard of it.Munnybagge never took him yachting again; and,
speaking to me once about him, he designated him, not by name, but as
"that infernal bloodless cad."However, as I have said, there was a desperate row between father and son,
and Frank is said to have slunk out of the house like a whipped cur, and
been quite dull company at the supper which he took after the opera that
night in Gillian Trussell's jolly Bohemian flat.When he emigrated, with
his studio traps filling half a dozen packing cases, none of the boys
bothered to see him off.They had learned to see through his good
fellowship, and recalled a poor little phantom, to whose life and
happiness he had been a wicked and bitter enemy.About a year after his departure I read the announcement in the Herald of
the marriage of Franklin D. Dobb, Sr., to a widow well-known and popular
in society.I took the trouble to ascertain that it was Frank's father,
and being among some of the boys that night, mentioned it to them."Well," remarked Smith, "that's really queer.You remember Frank left some
things in my care when he went away?Yesterday I got a letter asking about
them, and informing me that he had got married and was coming home."He did come home, and he settled in his old studio.What sort of a meeting
he had with his father this time I never heard.The old gentleman had been
paying him his allowance regularly while he was away, and I believe he
kept up the payment still.But otherwise he gave him no help, and if he
ever needed help he did now.His wife was a Cuban, as pretty and as helpless as a doll.She had been an
heiress till her brother had turned rebel and had his property
confiscated.Unfortunately for Frank, he had married her before the
culmination of this catastrophe.In fact, he had been paying court to her
with the dispatch announcing his wife's death in his pocket, and had
married her long before the poor little clay was well settled in the grave
he had sent it to.In marrying her he had evidently believed he was
establishing his future.So he was, but it was a future of expiation for
the sins and omissions of his past.Dobb was a tigress in her love and her jealousy.She was
childish and ignorant, and adored her husband as a man and an artist.She
measured his value by her estimation of him, and was on the watch
perpetually for trespassers on her domain.The domestic outbreaks between
the two were positively blood curdling.One afternoon, I remember, Gillian
Trussell, who had heard of his return, called on him.D. met her at
the studio door, told her, "Frank," as she called him, was out; slammed
the door in her face, and then flew at him with a palette scraper.We had
to break the door in, and found him holding her off by both wrists, and
she frothing in a mad fit of hysterics.From that day he was a changed
man.The life the pair lived after that was simply ridiculously miserable.He
had lost his old social popularity, and was forced to sell his pictures to
the cheap dealers, when he was lucky enough to sell them at all.The
paternal allowance would not support the flat they first occupied, and
they went into a boarding house.Inside of a month they were in the
papers, on account of outbreaks on Mrs.Dobb's part against one of the
ladies of the house.A couple of days after he leased a little room
opening into his studio, converted it into a bed-room, and they settled
there for good.Such a housekeeping as it was--like a scene in a farce.The studio had
long since run to seed, and a perpetual odor of something to eat hung over
it along with the sickening reek of the Florida water Mrs.D., like all
other creoles, made more liberal use of than of the pure element it was
half-named from.Crumbs and crusts and chop-bones, which the dog had left,
littered the rugs; and I can not recall the occasion on which the
caterer's tin box was not standing at the door, unless it was when the
dirty plates were piled up, there waiting for him to come for them.Frank had had a savage quarrel with her that day, and
wanted me for a <DW12>.But the scheme availed him nothing, for she broke
out over the soup and I left them to fight it out, and finished my feast
at a chop house.All of his old flirtations came back to curse him now.His light loves of
the playhouse and his innocent devotions of the ball room were alike the
instruments fate had forged into those of punishment for him.The very
names of his old fancies, which, with that subtle instinct all women
possess, she had found out, were sufficient to send his wife into a
frenzy.She was a chronic theatre-goer, and they never went to the theatre
without bringing a quarrel home with them.If he was silent at the play
she charged him with neglecting her; if he brisked up and tried to chat,
her jealousy would soon pick out some casus belli in the small talk he
strove to interest her with.A word to a passing friend, a glance at one
of her own sex, was sufficient to set her going.I shall never question
that jealousy is a form of actual madness, after what I saw of it in the
lives of that miserable man and woman.A year after his return he was the ghost of his old self.He was haggard
and often unshaven; his attire was shabby and carelessly put on; he had
lost his old, jaunty air, and went by you with a hurried pace, and his
head and shoulders bent with an indescribable suggestion of humility.The
fear of having her break out, regardless of any one who might be by, which
hung over him at home, haunted him out of doors, too.Dobb the first had broken his spirit as effectually as he had broken Mrs.Smith occupied the next studio to him, and one evening I was
smoking there, when an atrocious uproar commenced in the next room.We
could distinguish Frank's voice and his wife's, and another strange one.Smith looked at me, grinned, and shrugged his shoulders.The disturbance
ceased in a couple of minutes, and a door banged.Then came a crash, a shrill and furious scream, and the sound of feet.We
ran to the door, in time to see Mrs.Dobb, her hair in a tangle down her
back, in a dirty wrapper and slipshod slippers, stumbling down stairs.We
posted after her, Smith nearly breaking his neck by tripping over one of
the slippers which she had shed as she ran.The theatres were just out and
the streets full of people, among whom she jostled her way like the mad
woman that she was.We came up with her as she overtook her husband, who
was walking with McGilp, the dealer who handled his pictures.She seized
him by the arm and screamed out:

"I told you I would come with you."His face for a moment was the face of a devil, full of fury and despair.I
saw his fist clench itself and the big vein in his forehead swell.But he
slipped his hands into his pockets, looked appealingly at McGilp, and
said, shrugging his shoulders, "You see how it is, Mac?"McGilp nodded and walked abruptly away, with a look full of contempt and
scorn.We mingled with the crowd and saw the poor wretches go off
together, he grim and silent, she hysterically excited--with all the world
staring at them.Smith slept on a lounge in my room that night."I
couldn't get a wink up there," he said, "and I don't want to be even the
ear witness of a murder."The night did not witness the tragedy he anticipated, though.Next day,
Frank Dobb came to see me--a compliment he had not paid me for months.He
was the incarnation of abject misery, and so nervous that he could
scarcely speak intelligibly."I saw you in the crowd last night, old man," he said, looking at the
floor and twisting and untwisting his fingers.A
nice life for a fellow to lead, eh?"What else could I reply than, "Why do you lead it then?"he repeated, breaking into a hollow, uneasy laugh."Why, because I
love her, damn me!"Is this what you came to tell me?""No," he answered, "of course not.The fact is, I want you to help me out
of a hole.That row last night has settled me with McGilp.He came to see
me about a lot of pictures for a sale he is getting up out West, and the
senora kept up such a nagging that he got sick and suggested that we
should go to 'The Studio' for a chop and settle the business there.She
swore I shouldn't go, and that she would follow us if I did.I thought
she'd not go that far; but she did.So the McGilp affair is off for good,
I know.He's disgusted, and I don't blame him.Buy that Hoguet you wanted last year."The picture was one I had fancied and offered him a price for in his palmy
days, one that he had picked up abroad.I was only too glad to take it and
a couple more, for which I paid him at once; and next evening, at dinner,
I heard that he had levanted."Walked out this morning," said Smith, "and
sent a messenger an hour after with word that he had already left the
city.She came in to me with the letter in one hand and a dagger in the
other.She swears he has run away with another woman, and says she's going
to have her life, if she has to follow her around the world."She did not carry out her sanguinary purpose, though.There were some
consultations with old Dobb and then the studio was to let again.Some one
told me she had returned to Cuba, where she proposed to live on the
allowance her father-in-law had made her husband and which he now
continued to her.I had almost forgotten her when, several years later, in the lobby of the
Academy of Music, she touched my arm with her fan.She was promenading on
the arm of a handsome but beefy-looking Englishman, whom she introduced to
me as her husband.I had not heard of a divorce, but I took the
introduction as information that there had been one.The Englishman was a
better fellow than he looked.We supped together after the opera, and I
learned that he had met Mrs.Dobb in Havana, where he had spent some years
in business.I found her a changed woman--a new woman, indeed, in whom I
only now and then caught a glimpse of her old indolent, babyish and
foolish self.She was not only prettier than ever, but she had become a
sensible and clever woman.The influence of an intelligent man, who was
strong enough to bend her to his ways, had developed her latent brightness
and taught her to respect herself as well as him.I met her several times after that, and at the last meeting but one she
spoke of Frank for the first time.Her black eyes snapped when she uttered
his name.The devil was alive in them, though love was dead.I told her that I had heard nothing of him since his disappearance."But I have," she said, showing her white teeth in a curious smile.she went on bitterly; "and to think I could ever have loved
such a thing as he!X., that I never knew he had been
married till after he had fled?Then his father told me how he had courted
my father's money, with his wife lying dead at home.Before I heard that, I wanted to kill the woman who had
stolen you from me.The moment after I could have struck you dead at my
feet."She threw her arm up, holding her fan like a dagger.I believed her, and
so would any one who had seen her then."I had hardly settled in Havana," she continued, "before I received a
letter from him.Had the other woman
tired of him already?I asked myself, or was it really true, as his father
had told me, that he had fled alone?I answered the letter, and he wrote
again.Again I answered, and so it was kept up.For two years I played
with the love I now knew was worthless.He was traveling round the world,
and a dozen times wanted to come directly to me.I insisted that he should
keep his journey up--as a probation, you see.The exultation with which she told this was absolutely fiendish.I could
see in it, plainer than any words could tell it to me, the scheme of
vengeance she had carried out, the alternating hopes and torments to which
she had raised, and into which she had plunged him.I could see him
wandering around the globe, scourged by remorses, agonized by doubts, and
maddened by despairs, accepting the lies she wrote him as inviolable
pledges, and sustaining himself with the vision of a future never to be
fulfilled.She read the expression of my face, and laughed.And again she stabbed the air with her fan."But--pardon me the question--but you have begun the confidence," I said."I had been divorced while I was writing to him.A year ago he was to be
in London, where I was to meet him.While he was sailing from the Cape of
Good Hope I was being married to a man who loved me for myself, and to
whom I had confided all.Instead of my address at the London post office
he received a notification of my marriage, addressed to him in my own hand
and mailed to him by myself.He wrote once or twice still, but my husband
indorsed the letters with his own name and returned them unopened.He may
be dead for all I know, but I hope and pray he is still alive, and will
remain alive and love me for a thousand years."She opened her arms, as if to hug her vengeance to her heart, and looked
at me steadily with eyes that thrilled me with their lambent fire.No
wonder the wretched vagabond loved her!What a doom his selfishness and
his duplicity had invoked upon him!I believe if he could have seen her as
I saw her then, so different from and better than he knew her to be, he
would have gone mad on the spot.Dobb the first was indeed
avenged.We sipped our chocolate and talked of other things, as if such a being as
Frank Dobb had never been.Her husband joined us and we made an evening of
it at the theatre.I knew from the way he looked at me, and from the
increased warmth of his manner, that he was conversant with his wife's
having made a confidant of me.But I do not think he knew how far her
confidence had gone.I have often wondered since if he knew how deep and
fierce the hatred she carried for his predecessor was.There are things
women will reveal to strangers which they will die rather than divulge to
those they love.I saw them off to Europe, for they were going to establish themselves in
London, and I have never seen or directly heard from them since.But some
months after their departure I received a letter from Robinson, who has
been painting there ever since his picture made that great hit in the
Salon of '7--."I have odd news for you," he wrote."You remember Frank Dobb, who
belonged to our old Pen and Pencil Club, and who ran away from that Cuban
wife of his just before I left home?Well, about a year ago I met him in
Fleet street, the shabbiest beggar you ever saw.He was quite tight and
smelled of gin across the street.He was taking a couple of drawings to a
penny dreadful office which he was making pictures for at ten shillings a
piece.I went to see him once, in the dismalest street back of Drury Lane.He was doing some painting for a dealer, when he was sober enough, and of
all the holes you ever saw his was it.I soon had to sit down on him, for
he got into the habit of coming to see me and loafing around, making the
studio smell like a pub, till I would lend him five shillings to go away.I heard nothing of him till the other day I came across an event which
this from the Telegraph will explain."The following newspaper paragraph was appended:

"The man who shot himself on the door-step of Mr.Bennerley Green, the
West India merchant, last Monday, has been discovered to be an American
who for some time has been employed furnishing illustrations to the lower
order of publications here.He was known as Allan, but this is said to
have been an assumed name.He is stated to be the son of a wealthy New
Yorker, who discarded him in consequence of his habits of dissipation, and
to have once been an artist of considerable prominence in the United
States.All that is known of the suicide is the story told by the servant,
who a few minutes after admitting his master and mistress upon their
return from the theatre, heard the report of a pistol in the street, and
on opening the door found the wretched man dead upon the step.The body
was buried after the inquest at the charge of the eminent American artist,
Mr.J. J. Robinson, A. R. A., who had known him in his better days."Bennerley Green, the West

FIFE WHEAT

It is the best wheat I ever raised or saw.I sowed one quart and got from
it three bushels of beautiful wheat weighing 63 pounds to the bushel,
which took the first premium at our county fair.I have been offered $15 a
bushel for my seed, but would not part with a handful of it.If I could
not get more like it, I would not sell the three bushels I raised from the
quart for $100.STEABNER, Sorlien's Mill, Yellow Medicine Co., Minn.Farmers, if you want to know more of this wheat, write to

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Prairie Farmer, Vol.The ordinary course of life, with fine air and contented
minds, was to do a full share of work till seventy, and then to look
after "orra" jobs well into the eighties, and to "slip awa" within sight
of ninety.Persons above ninety were understood to be acquitting
themselves with credit, and assumed airs of authority, brushing aside
the opinions of seventy as immature, and confirming their conclusions
with illustrations drawn from the end of last century.When Hillocks' brother so far forgot himself as to "slip awa"
at sixty, that worthy man was scandalized, and offered laboured
explanations at the "beerial.""It's an awfu' business ony wy ye look at it, an' a sair trial tae us
a'.A' never heard tell o' sic a thing in oor family afore, an' it's no
easy accoontin' for't."The gudewife was sayin' he wes never the same sin' a weet nicht he lost
himsel on the muir and slept below a bush; but that's neither here nor
there.A'm thinkin' he sappit his constitution thae twa years he wes
grieve aboot England.That wes thirty years syne, but ye're never the
same aifter thae foreign climates."Drumtochty listened patiently to Hillocks' apology, but was not
satisfied."It's clean havers about the muir.Losh keep's, we've a' sleepit oot and
never been a hair the waur."A' admit that England micht hae dune the job; it's no cannie stravagin'
yon wy frae place tae place, but Drums never complained tae me if he hed
been nippit in the Sooth."The parish had, in fact, lost confidence in Drums after his wayward
experiment with a potato-digging machine, which turned out a lamentable
failure, and his premature departure confirmed our vague impression of
his character."He's awa noo," Drumsheugh summed up, after opinion had time to form;
"an' there were waur fouk than Drums, but there's nae doot he was a wee
flichty."When illness had the audacity to attack a Drumtochty man, it was
described as a "whup," and was treated by the men with a fine
negligence.Hillocks was sitting in the post-office one afternoon when
I looked in for my letters, and the right side of his face was blazing
red.His subject of discourse was the prospects of the turnip "breer,"
but he casually explained that he was waiting for medical advice."The gudewife is keepin' up a ding-dong frae mornin' till nicht aboot ma
face, and a'm fair deaved (deafened), so a'm watchin' for MacLure tae
get a bottle as he comes wast; yon's him noo."The doctor made his diagnosis from horseback on sight, and stated the
result with that admirable clearness which endeared him to Drumtochty."Confoond ye, Hillocks, what are ye ploiterin' aboot here for in the
weet wi' a face like a boiled beet?<DW37> ye no ken that ye've a titch o'
the rose (erysipelas), and ocht tae be in the hoose?Gae hame wi' ye
afore a' leave the bit, and send a haflin for some medicine.Ye donnerd
idiot, are ye ettlin tae follow Drums afore yir time?"And the medical
attendant of Drumtochty continued his invective till Hillocks started,
and still pursued his  retreating figure with medical directions of a
simple and practical character.[Illustration: "THE GUDEWIFE IS KEEPIN' UP A DING-DONG"]

"A'm watchin', an' peety ye if ye pit aff time.Keep yir bed the
mornin', and dinna show yir face in the fields till a' see ye.A'll gie
ye a cry on Monday--sic an auld fule--but there's no are o' them tae
mind anither in the hale pairish."Hillocks' wife informed the kirkyaird that the doctor "gied the gudeman
an awfu' clear-in'," and that Hillocks "wes keepin' the hoose," which
meant that the patient had tea breakfast, and at that time was wandering
about the farm buildings in an easy undress with his head in a plaid.It was impossible for a doctor to earn even the most modest competence
from a people of such scandalous health, and so MacLure had annexed
neighbouring parishes.His house--little more than a cottage--stood on
the roadside among the pines towards the head of our Glen, and from this
base of operations he dominated the wild glen that broke the wall of the
Grampians above Drumtochty--where the snow drifts were twelve feet deep
in winter, and the only way of passage at times was the channel of the
river--and the moorland district westwards till he came to the Dunleith
sphere of influence, where there were four doctors and a hydropathic.Drumtochty in its length, which was eight miles, and its breadth, which
was four, lay in his hand; besides a glen behind, unknown to the world,
which in the night time he visited at the risk of life, for the way
thereto was across the big moor with its peat holes and treacherous
bogs.And he held the land eastwards towards Muirtown so far as Geordie,
the Drumtochty post, travelled every day, and could carry word that the
doctor was wanted.He did his best for the need of every man, woman and
child in this wild, straggling district, year in, year out, in the snow
and in the heat, in the dark and in the light, without rest, and without
holiday for forty years.One horse could not do the work of this man, but we liked best to see
him on his old white mare, who died the week after her master, and the
passing of the two did our hearts good.It was not that he rode
beautifully, for he broke every canon of art, flying with his arms,
stooping till he seemed to be speaking into Jess's ears, and rising in
the saddle beyond all necessity.But he could rise faster, stay longer
in the saddle, and had a firmer grip with his knees than any one I ever
met, and it was all for mercy's sake.When the reapers in harvest time
saw a figure whirling past in a cloud of dust, or the family at the foot
of Glen Urtach, gathered round the fire on a winter's night, heard the
rattle of a horse's hoofs on the road, or the shepherds, out after the
sheep, traced a black speck moving across the snow to the upper glen,
they knew it was the doctor, and, without being conscious of it, wished
him God speed.[Illustration]

Before and behind his saddle were strapped the instruments and medicines
the doctor might want, for he never knew what was before him.There were
no specialists in Drumtochty, so this man had to do everything as best
he could, and as quickly.He was chest doctor and doctor for every other
organ as well; he was accoucheur and surgeon; he was oculist and aurist;
he was dentist and chloroformist, besides being chemist and druggist.It was often told how he was far up Glen Urtach when the feeders of the
threshing mill caught young Burnbrae, and how he only stopped to change
horses at his house, and galloped all the way to Burnbrae, and flung
himself off his horse and amputated the arm, and saved the lad's life."You wud hae thocht that every meenut was an hour," said Jamie Soutar,
who had been at the threshing, "an' a'll never forget the puir lad lying
as white as deith on the floor o' the loft, wi' his head on a sheaf, an'
Burnbrae haudin' the bandage ticht an' prayin' a' the while, and the
mither greetin' in the corner.she cries, an' a' heard the soond o' the horse's
feet on the road a mile awa in the frosty air.said Burnbrae, and a' slippit doon the ladder
as the doctor came skelpin' intae the close, the foam fleein' frae his
horse's mooth.wes a' that passed his lips, an' in five meenuts he hed
him on the feedin' board, and wes at his wark--sic wark, neeburs--but he
did it weel.An' ae thing a' thocht rael thochtfu' o' him: he first sent
aff the laddie's mither tae get a bed ready."Noo that's feenished, and his constitution 'ill dae the rest," and he
carried the lad doon the ladder in his airms like a bairn, and laid him
in his bed, and waits aside him till he wes sleepin', and then says he:
'Burnbrae, yir gey lad never tae say 'Collie, will yelick?'for a' hevna
tasted meat for saxteen hoors.'"It was michty tae see him come intae the yaird that day, neeburs; the
verra look o' him wes victory."[Illustration: "THE VERRA LOOK O' HIM WES VICTORY"]

Jamie's cynicism slipped off in the enthusiasm of this reminiscence, and
he expressed the feeling of Drumtochty.No one sent for MacLure save in
great straits, and the sight of him put courage in sinking hearts.But
this was not by the grace of his appearance, or the advantage of a good
bedside manner.A tall, gaunt, loosely made man, without an ounce of
superfluous flesh on his body, his face burned a dark brick color by
constant exposure to the weather, red hair and beard turning grey,
honest blue eyes that look you ever in the face, huge hands with wrist
bones like the shank of a ham, and a voice that hurled his salutations
across two fields, he suggested the moor rather  than the drawing-room.But what a clever hand it was in an operation, as delicate as a woman's,
and what a kindly voice it was in the humble room where the shepherd's
wife was weeping by her man's bedside.He was "ill pitten the gither" to
begin with, but many of his physical defects were the penalties of his
work, and endeared him to the Glen.That ugly scar that cut into his
right eyebrow and gave him such a sinister expression, was got one night
Jess slipped on the ice and laid him insensible eight miles from home.His limp marked the big snowstorm in the fifties, when his horse missed
the road in Glen Urtach, and they rolled together in a drift.MacLure
escaped with a broken leg and the fracture of three ribs, but he never
walked like other men again.He could not swing himself into the saddle
without making two attempts and holding Jess's mane.Neither can you
"warstle" through the peat bogs and snow drifts for forty winters
without a touch of rheumatism.But they were honorable scars, and for
such risks of life men get the Victoria Cross in other fields.[Illustration: "FOR SUCH RISKS OF LIFE MEN GET THE VICTORIA CROSS IN
OTHER FIELDS"]

MacLure got nothing but the secret affection of the Glen, which knew
that none had ever done one-tenth as much for it as this ungainly,
twisted, battered figure, and I have  seen a Drumtochty face
soften at the sight of MacLure limping to his horse.Hopps earned the ill-will of the Glen for ever by criticising
the doctor's dress, but indeed it would have filled any townsman with
amazement.Black he wore once a year, on Sacrament Sunday, and, if
possible, at a funeral; topcoat or waterproof never.His jacket and
waistcoat were rough homespun of Glen Urtach wool, which threw off the
wet like a duck's back, and below he was clad in shepherd's tartan
trousers, which disappeared into unpolished riding boots.His shirt was
grey flannel, and he was uncertain about a collar, but certain as to a
tie which he never had, his beard doing instead, and his hat was soft
felt of four colors and seven different shapes.His point of distinction
in dress was the trousers, and they were the subject of unending
speculation."Some threep that he's worn thae eedentical pair the last twenty year,
an' a' mind masel him gettin' a tear ahint, when he was crossin' oor
palin', and the mend's still veesible."Ithers declare 'at he's got a wab o' claith, and hes a new pair made in
Muirtown aince in the twa year maybe, and keeps them in the garden till
the new look wears aff."For ma ain pairt," Soutar used to declare, "a' canna mak up my mind,
but there's ae thing sure, the Glen wud not like tae see him withoot
them: it wud be a shock tae confidence.There's no muckle o' the check
left, but ye can aye tell it, and when ye see thae breeks comin' in ye
ken that if human pooer can save yir bairn's life it 'ill be dune."The confidence of the Glen--and tributary states--was unbounded, and
rested partly on long experience of the doctor's resources, and partly
on his hereditary connection."His father was here afore him," Mrs.Macfadyen used to explain; "atween
them they've hed the countyside for weel on tae a century; if MacLure
disna understand oor constitution, wha dis, a' wud like tae ask?"For Drumtochty had its own constitution and a special throat disease, as
became a parish which was quite self-contained between the woods and the
hills, and not dependent on the lowlands either for its diseases or its
doctors."He's a skilly man, Doctor MacLure," continued my friend Mrs.Macfayden,
whose judgment on sermons or anything else was seldom at fault; "an'
a kind-hearted, though o' coorse he hes his faults like us a', an' he
disna tribble the Kirk often."He aye can tell what's wrang wi' a body, an' maistly he can put ye
richt, and there's nae new-fangled wys wi' him: a blister for the
ootside an' Epsom salts for the inside dis his wark, an' they say
there's no an herb on the hills he disna ken."If we're tae dee, we're tae dee; an' if we're tae live, we're tae live,"
concluded Elspeth, with sound Calvinistic logic; "but a'll say this
for the doctor, that whether yir tae live or dee, he can aye keep up a
sharp meisture on the skin.""But he's no veera ceevil gin ye bring him when there's naethin' wrang,"
and Mrs.Macfayden's face reflected another of Mr.Hopps' misadventures
of which Hillocks held the copyright."Hopps' laddie ate grosarts (gooseberries) till they hed to sit up a'
nicht wi' him, an' naethin' wud do but they maun hae the doctor, an' he
writes 'immediately' on a slip o' paper."Weel, MacLure had been awa a' nicht wi' a shepherd's wife Dunleith wy,
and he comes here withoot drawin' bridle, mud up tae the cen."'What's a dae here, Hillocks?"he cries; 'it's no an accident, is't?'and when he got aff his horse he cud hardly stand wi' stiffness and
tire."'It's nane o' us, doctor; it's Hopps' laddie; he's been eatin' ower
mony berries.'[Illustration: "HOPPS' LADDIE ATE GROSARTS"]

"If he didna turn on me like a tiger."<DW37> ye mean tae say----'

"'Weesht, weesht,' an' I tried tae quiet him, for Hopps wes comin' oot."'Well, doctor,' begins he, as brisk as a magpie, 'you're here at last;
there's no hurry with you Scotchmen.My boy has been sick all night, and
I've never had one wink of sleep.You might have come a little quicker,
that's all I've got to say.'"We've mair tae dae in Drumtochty than attend tae every bairn that hes a
sair stomach,' and a' saw MacLure wes roosed.Our doctor at home always says to
Mrs.'Opps "Look on me as a family friend, Mrs.'Opps, and send for me
though it be only a headache."'"'He'd be mair sparin' o' his offers if he hed four and twenty mile tae
look aifter.There's naethin' wrang wi' yir laddie but greed.Gie him a
gude dose o' castor oil and stop his meat for a day, an' he 'ill be a'
richt the morn.'"'He 'ill not take castor oil, doctor.We have given up those barbarous
medicines.'"'Whatna kind o' medicines hae ye noo in the Sooth?'MacLure, we're homoeopathists, and I've my little
chest here,' and oot Hopps comes wi' his boxy."'Let's see't,' an' MacLure sits doon and taks oot the bit bottles, and
he reads the names wi' a lauch every time."'Belladonna; did ye ever hear the like?Weel, ma mannie,' he says tae Hopps, 'it's a fine
ploy, and ye 'ill better gang on wi' the Nux till it's dune, and gie him
ony ither o' the sweeties he fancies."'Noo, Hillocks, a' maun be aff tae see Drumsheugh's grieve, for he's
doon wi' the fever, and it's tae be a teuch fecht.A' hinna time tae
wait for dinner; gie me some cheese an' cake in ma haund, and Jess 'ill
tak a pail o' meal an' water."'Fee; a'm no wantin' yir fees, man; wi' that boxy ye dinna need a
doctor; na, na, gie yir siller tae some puir body, Maister Hopps,' an'
he was doon the road as hard as he cud lick."His fees were pretty much what the folk chose to give him, and he
collected them once a year at Kildrummie fair."Well, doctor, what am a' awin' ye for the wife and bairn?Ye 'ill need
three notes for that nicht ye stayed in the hoose an' a' the veesits.""Havers," MacLure would answer, "prices are low, a'm hearing; gie's
thirty shillings.""No, a'll no, or the wife 'ill tak ma ears off," and it was settled for
two pounds.Lord Kilspindie gave him a free house and fields, and one
way or other, Drumsheugh told me, the doctor might get in about L150.a year, out of which he had to pay his old housekeeper's wages and a
boy's, and keep two horses, besides the cost of instruments and books,
which he bought through a friend in Edinburgh with much judgment.There was only one man who ever complained of the doctor's charges, and
that was the new farmer of Milton, who was so good that he was above
both churches, and held a meeting in his barn.(It was Milton the Glen
supposed at first to be a Mormon, but I can't go into that now.)He
offered MacLure a pound less than he asked, and two tracts, whereupon
MacLure expressed his opinion of Milton, both from a theological and
social standpoint, with such vigor and frankness that an attentive
audience of Drumtochty men could hardly contain themselves.Jamie Soutar
was selling his pig at the time, and missed the meeting, but he hastened
to condole with Milton, who was complaining everywhere of the doctor's
language.[Illustration]

"Ye did richt tae resist him; it 'ill maybe roose the Glen tae mak a
stand; he fair hands them in bondage."Thirty shillings for twal veesits, and him no mair than seeven mile
awa, an' a'm telt there werena mair than four at nicht."Ye 'ill hae the sympathy o' the Glen, for a' body kens yir as free wi'
yir siller as yir tracts."Wes't 'Beware o' gude warks' ye offered him?Man, ye choose it weel,
for he's been colleckin' sae mony thae forty years, a'm feared for him."A've often thocht oor doctor's little better than the Gude Samaritan,
an' the Pharisees didna think muckle o' his chance aither in this warld
or that which is tae come.""Yes, sir; and here is another letter from the steward of the Princess de
Saint-Dizier.""Pray, sir, draw near the fire, whilst I just see what is in this letter.The weather is so bad," continued the bailiff, obligingly, "may I not
offer you some refreshment?""A thousand thanks, my dear sir; I am off again in an hour."Whilst M. Dupont read, M. Rodin threw inquisitive glances round the
chamber; like a man of skill and experience, he had frequently drawn just
and useful inductions from those little appearances, which, revealing a
taste or habit, give at the same time some notion of a character; on this
occasion, however, his curiosity was at fault."Very good, sir," said the bailiff, when he had finished reading; "the
steward renews his recommendation, and tells me to attend implicitly to
your commands.""Well, sir, they will amount to very little, and I shall not trouble you
long.""It will be no trouble, but an honor.""Nay, I know how much your time must be occupied, for, as soon as one
enters this chateau, one is struck with the good order and perfect
keeping of everything in it--which proves, my dear sir, what excellent
care you take of it.""Oh, sir, you flatter me.""Flatter you?--a poor old man like myself has something else to think of.But to come to business: there is a room here which is called the Green
Chamber?""Yes, sir; the room which the late Count-Duke de Cardoville used for a
study.""You will have the goodness to take me there.""Unfortunately, it is not in my power to do so.After the death of the
Count-Duke, and when the seals were removed, a number of papers were shut
up in a cabinet in that room, and the lawyers took the keys with them to
Paris.""Here are those keys," said M. Rodin, showing to the bailiff a large and
a small key tied together."Yes--for certain papers--and also far a small mahogany casket, with
silver clasps--do you happen to know it?""Yes, sir; I have often seen it on the count's writing-table.Mary moved to the garden.It must be
in the large, lacquered cabinet, of which you have the key.""You will conduct me to this chamber, as authorized by the Princess de
Saint-Dizier?""Yes, sir; the princess continues in good health?""And Mademoiselle Adrienne?"said M. Rodin, with a sigh of deep contrition and
grief.has any calamity happened to Mademoiselle Adrienne?""No, no--she is, unfortunately, as well as she is beautiful."for when beauty, youth, and health are joined to an evil
spirit of revolt and perversity--to a character which certainly has not
its equal upon earth--it would be far better to be deprived of those
dangerous advantages, which only become so many causes of perdition.But
I conjure you, my dear sir, let us talk of something else: this subject
is too painful," said M. Rodin, with a voice of deep emotion, lifting the
tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as if to stop a
rising tear.The bailiff did not see the tear, but he saw the gesture, and he was
struck with the change in M. Rodin's voice.He answered him, therefore,
with much sympathy: "Pardon my indiscretion, sir; I really did not
know--"

"It is I who should ask pardon for this involuntary display of
feeling--tears are so rare with old men--but if you had seen, as I have,
the despair of that excellent princess, whose only fault has been too
much kindness, too much weakness, with regard to her niece--by which she
has encouraged her--but, once more, let us talk of something else, my
dear sir!"After a moment's pause, during which M. Rodin seemed to recover from his
emotion, he said to Dupont: "One part of my mission, my dear sir--that
which relates to the Green Chamber--I have now told you; but there is yet
another.Before coming to it, however, I must remind you of a
circumstance you have perhaps forgotten--namely, that some fifteen or
sixteen years ago, the Marquis d'Aigrigny, then colonel of the hussars in
garrison at Abbeville, spent some time in this house."It was only just now, that I
was talking about him to my wife.He was the life of the house!--how well
he could perform plays--particularly the character of a scapegrace.In
the Two Edmonds, for instance, he would make you die with laughing, in
that part of a drunken soldier--and then, with what a charming voice he
sang Joconde, sir--better than they could sing it at Paris!"Rodin, having listened complacently to the bailiff, said to him: "You
doubtless know that, after a fierce duel he had with a furious
Bonapartist, one General Simon, the Marquis d'Aigrigny (whose private
secretary I have now the honor to be) left the world for the church.""That fine officer--brave, noble, rich, esteemed, and
flattered--abandoned all those advantages for the sorry black gown; and,
notwithstanding his name, position, high connections, his reputation as a
great preacher, he is still what he was fourteen years ago--a plain
abbe--whilst so many, who have neither his merit nor his virtues, are
archbishops and cardinals."M. Rodin expressed himself with so much goodness, with such an air of
conviction, and the facts he cited appeared to be so incontestable, that
M. Dupont could not help exclaiming: "Well, sir, that is splendid
conduct!"said M. Rodin, with an inimitable expression of
simplicity; "it is quite a matter of course when one has a heart like M.
d'Aigrigny's.But amongst all his good qualities, he has particularly
that of never forgetting worthy people--people of integrity, honor,
conscience--and therefore, my dear M. Dupont, he has not forgotten you.""What, the most noble marquis deigns to remember--"

"Three days ago, I received a letter from him, in which he mentions your
name.""He will be there soon, if not there now.He went to Italy about three
months ago, and, during his absence, he received a very sad piece of
news--the death of his mother, who was passing the autumn on one of the
estates of the Princess de Saint-Dizier.""Yes, it was a cruel grief to him; but we must all resign ourselves to
the will of Providence!""And with regard to what subject did the marquis do me the honor to
mention my name?"First of all, you must know that this house is
sold.The bill of sale was signed the day before my departure from
Paris.""I am afraid that the new proprietors may not choose to keep me as their
bailiff."It is just on that subject that I am going
to speak to you."Knowing the interest which the marquis feels for you, I am
particularly desirous that you should keep this place, and I will do all
in my power to serve you, if--"

"Ah, sir!"cried Dupont, interrupting Rodin; "what gratitude do I not owe
you!"Now, my dear sir, you flatter me in your turn; but I ought to tell you,
that I'm obliged to annex a small condition to my support.""The person who is about to inhabit this mansion, is an old lady in every
way worthy of veneration; Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is the name of this
respectable--"

"What, sir?"said the bailiff, interrupting Rodin; "Madame de la Sainte
Colombe the lady who has bought us out?""Yes, sir, she came last week to see the estate.My wife persists that
she is a great lady; but--between ourselves--judging by certain words
that I heard her speak--"

"You are full of penetration, my dear M. Dupont.Madame de la Sainte
Colombe is far from being a great lady.I believe she was neither more
nor less than a milliner, under one of the wooden porticoes of the Palais
Royal.You see, that I deal openly with you.""And she boasted of all the noblemen, French and foreign, who used to
visit her!""No doubt, they came to buy bonnets for their wives!However, the fact
is, that, having gained a large fortune and, after being in youth and
middle age--indifferent--alas!more than indifferent to the salvation of
her soul--Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is now in a likely way to
experience grace--which renders her, as I told you, worthy of veneration,
because nothing is so respectable as a sincere repentance--always
providing it to be lasting.Now to make the good work sure and effectual,
we shall need your assistance, my dear M."A great deal; and I will explain to you how.There is no church in this
village, which stands at an equal distance from either of two parishes.Madame de la Sainte-Colombe, wishing to make choice of one of the two
clergymen, will naturally apply to you and Madame Dupont, who have long
lived in these parts, for information respecting them."in that case the choice will soon be made.The incumbent of
Danicourt is one of the best of men.""Now that is precisely what you must not say to Madame de la Sainte
Colombe.""You must, on the contrary, much praise, without ceasing, the curate of
Roiville, the other parish, so as to decide this good lady to trust
herself to his care.""And why, sir, to him rather than to the other?""Why?--because, if you and Madame Dupont succeed in persuading Madame de
la Sainte-Colombe to make the choice I wish, you will be certain to keep
your place as bailiff.I give you my word of it, and what I promise I
perform.""I do not doubt, sir, that you have this power," said Dupont, convinced
by Rodin's manner, and the authority of his words; "but I should like to
know--"

"One word more," said Rodin, interrupting him; "I will deal openly with
you, and tell you why I insist on the preference which I beg you to
support.I should be grieved if you saw in all this the shadow of an
intrigue.It is only for the purpose of doing a good action.The curate
of Roiville, for whom I ask your influence, is a man for whom M.
d'Aigrigny feels a deep interest.Though very poor, he has to support an
aged mother.Now, if he had the spiritual care of Madame de la Sainte
Colombe, he would do more good than any one else, because he is full of
zeal and patience; and then it is clear he would reap some little
advantages, by which his old mother might profit--there you see is the
secret of this mighty scheme.When I knew that this lady was disposed to
buy an estate in the neighborhood of our friend's parish, I wrote about
it to the marquis; and he, remembering you, desired me to ask you to
render him this small service, which, as you see, will not remain without
a recompense.For I tell you once more, and I will prove it, that I have
the power to keep you in your place as bailiff.""Well, sir," replied Dupont, after a moment's reflection, "you are so
frank and obliging, that I will imitate your sincerity.In the same
degree that the curate of Danicourt is respected and loved in this
country, the curate of Roiville, whom you wish me to prefer to him, is
dreaded for his intolerance--and, moreover--"

"Well, and what more?""Why, then, they say--"

"Come, what do they say?"Upon these words, M. Rodin burst into so hearty a laugh that the bailiff
was quite struck dumb with amazement--for the countenance of M. Rodin
took a singular expression when he laughed.he repeated, with
redoubled hilarity; "a Jesuit!--Now really, my dear M. Dupont, for a man
of sense, experience, and intelligence, how can you believe such idle
stories?--A Jesuit--are there such people as Jesuits?--in our time, above
all, can you believe such romance of the Jacobins, hobgoblins of the old
freedom lovers?--Come, come; I wager, you have read about them in the
Constitutionnel!""And yet, sir, they say--"

"Good heavens!what will they not say?--But wise men, prudent men like
you, do not meddle with what is said--they manage their own little
matters, without doing injury to any one, and they never sacrifice, for
the sake of nonsense, a good place, which secures them a comfortable
provision for the rest of their days.I tell you frankly, however much I
may regret it, that should you not succeed in getting the preference for
my man, you will not remain bailiff here."But, sir," said poor Dupont, "it will not be my fault, if this lady,
hearing a great deal in praise of the other curate, should prefer him to
your friend."but if, on the other hand, persons who have long lived in the
neighborhood--persons worthy of confidence, whom she will see every
day--tell Madame de la Sainte-Colombe a great deal of good of my friend,
and a great deal of harm of the other curate, she will prefer the former,
and you will continue bailiff.""But, sir--that would be calumny!"said Rodin, with an air of sorrowful and
affectionate reproach, "how can you think me capable of giving you evil
counsel?--I was only making a supposition.You wish to remain bailiff on
this estate.I offer you the certainty of doing so--it is for you to
consider and decide.""But, sir--"

"One word more--or rather one more condition--as important as the other.Unfortunately, we have seen clergymen take advantage of the age and
weakness of their penitents, unfairly to benefit either themselves or
others: I believe our protege incapable of any such baseness--but, in
order to discharge my responsibility--and yours also, as you will have
contributed to his appointment--I must request that you will write to me
twice a week, giving the most exact detail of all that you have remarked
in the character, habits, connections, pursuits, of Madame de la Sainte
Colombe--for the influence of a confessor, you see, reveals itself in the
whole conduct of life, and I should wish to be fully edified by the
proceedings of my friend, without his being aware of it--or, if anything
blameable were to strike you, I should be immediately informed of it by
this weekly correspondence.""But, sir--that would be to act as a spy?""Now, my dear M. Dupont!how can you thus brand the sweetest, most
wholesome of human desires--mutual confidence?--I ask of you nothing
else--I ask of you to write to me confidentially the details of all that
goes on here.On these two conditions, inseparable one from the other,
you remain bailiff; otherwise, I shall be forced, with grief and regret,
to recommend some one else to Madame de la Sainte-Colombe.""I beg you, sir," said Dupont, with emotion, "Be generous without any
conditions!--I and my wife have only this place to give us bread, and we
are too old to find another.Do not expose our probity of forty years'
standing to be tempted by the fear of want, which is so bad a
counsellor!""My dear M. Dupont, you are really a great child: you must reflect upon
this, and give me your answer in the course of a week."I implore you--" The conversation was here interrupted by a
loud report, which was almost instantaneously repeated by the echoes of
the cliffs.Hardly had he spoken, when the
same noise was again heard more distinctly than before."It is the sound of cannon," cried Dupont, rising; "no doubt a ship in
distress, or signaling for a pilot.""My dear," said the bailiffs wife, entering abruptly, "from the terrace,
we can see a steamer and a large ship nearly dismasted--they are drifting
right upon the shore--the ship is firing minute gulls--it will be lost."cried the bailiff, taking his hat and preparing to
go out, "to look on at a shipwreck, and be able to do nothing!""Can no help be given to these vessels?""If they are driven upon the reefs, no human power can save them; since
the last equinox two ships have been lost on this coast.""Lost with all on board?--Oh, very frightful," said M. Rodin."In such a storm, there is but little chance for the crew; no matter,"
said the bailiff, addressing his wife, "I will run down to the rocks with
the people of the farm, and try to save some of them, poor
creatures!--Light large fires in several rooms--get ready linen, clothes,
cordials--I scarcely dare hope to save any, but we must do our best."I should think it a duty, if I could be at all useful, but I am too old
and feeble to be of any service," said M. Rodin, who was by no means
anxious to encounter the storm."Your good lady will be kind enough to
show me the Green Chamber, and when I have found the articles I require,
I will set out immediately for Paris, for I am in great haste."Ring the big bell," said the
bailiff to his servant; "let all the people of the farm meet me at the
foot of the cliff, with ropes and levers.""Yes, my dear," replied Catherine; "but do not expose yourself.""Kiss me--it will bring me luck," said the bailiff; and he started at a
full run, crying: "Quick!quick; by this time not a plank may remain of
the vessels.""My dear madam," said Rodin, always impassible, "will you be obliging
enough to show me the Green Chamber?""Please to follow me, sir," answered Catherine, drying her tears--for she
trembled on account of her husband, whose courage she well knew.THE TEMPEST

The sea is raging.Mountainous waves of dark green, marbled with white
foam, stand out, in high, deep undulations, from the broad streak of red
light, which extends along the horizon.Above are piled heavy masses of
black and sulphurous vapor, whilst a few lighter clouds of a reddish
gray, driven by the violence of the wind, rush across the murky sky.The pale winter sun, before he quite disappears in the great clouds,
behind which he is slowly mounting, casts here and there some oblique
rays upon the troubled sea, and gilds the transparent crest of some of
the tallest waves.A band of snow-white foam boils and rages as far as
the eye can reach, along the line of the reefs that bristle on this
dangerous coast.Half-way up a rugged promontory, which juts pretty far into the sea,
rises Cardoville Castle; a ray of the sun glitters upon its windows; its
brick walls and pointed roofs of slate are visible in the midst of this
sky loaded with vapors.A large, disabled ship, with mere shreds of sail still fluttering from
the stumps of broken masts, drives dead upon the coast.Now she rolls her
monstrous hull upon the waves--now plunges into their trough.A flash is
seen, followed by a dull sound, scarcely perceptible in the midst of the
roar of the tempest.That gun is the last signal of distress from this
lost vessel, which is fast forging on the breakers.At the same moment, a steamer, with its long plume of black smoke, is
working her way from east to west, making every effort to keep at a
distance from the shore, leaving the breakers on her left.The dismasted
ship, drifting towards the rocks, at the mercy of the wind and tide, must
some time pass right ahead of the steamer.Suddenly, the rush of a heavy sea laid the steamer upon her side; the
enormous wave broke furiously on her deck; in a second the chimney was
carried away, the paddle box stove in, one of the wheels rendered
useless.A second white-cap, following the first, again struck the vessel
amidships, and so increased the damage that, no longer answering to the
helm, she also drifted towards the shore, in the same direction as the
ship.But the latter, though further from the breakers, presented a
greater surface to the wind and sea, and so gained upon the steamer in
swiftness that a collision between the two vessels became imminent--a new
clanger added to all the horrors of the now certain wreck.The ship was an English vessel, the "Black Eagle," homeward bound from
Alexandria, with passengers, who arriving from India and Java, via the
Red Sea, had disembarked at the Isthmus of Suez, from on board the
steamship "Ruyter."The "Black Eagle," quitting the Straits of Gibraltar,
had gone to touch at the Azores.She headed thence for Portsmouth, when
she was overtaken in the Channel by the northwester.The steamer was the
"William Tell," coming from Germany, by way of the Elbe, and bound, in
the last place, for Hamburg to Havre.These two vessels, the sport of enormous rollers, driven along by tide
and tempest, were now rushing upon the breakers with frightful speed.The
deck of each offered a terrible spectacle; the loss of crew and
passengers appeared almost certain, for before them a tremendous sea
broke on jagged rocks, at the foot of a perpendicular cliff.The captain of the "Black Eagle," standing on the poop, holding by the
remnant of a spar, issued his last orders in this fearful extremity with
courageous coolness.The smaller boats had been carried away by the
waves; it was in vain to think of launching the long-boat; the only
chance of escape in case the ship should not be immediately dashed to
pieces on touching the rocks, was to establish a communication with the
land by means of a life-line--almost the last resort for passing between
the shore and a stranded vessel.The deck was covered with passengers, whose cries and terror augmented
the general confusion.Some, struck with a kind of stupor, and clinging
convulsively to the shrouds, awaited their doom in a state of stupid
insensibility.Others wrung their hands in despair, or rolled upon the
deck uttering horrible imprecations.Here, women knelt down to pray;
there, others hid their faces in their hands, that they might not see the
awful approach of death.A young mother, pale as a specter, holding her
child clasped tightly to her bosom, went supplicating from sailor to
sailor, and offering a purse full of gold and jewels to any one that
would take charge of her son.These cries, and tears, and terror contrasted with the stern and silent
resignation of the sailors.Knowing the imminence of the inevitable
danger, some of them stripped themselves of part of their clothes,
waiting for the moment to make a last effort, to dispute their lives with
the fury of the waves; others renouncing all hope, prepared to meet death
with stoical indifference.Here and there, touching or awful episodes rose in relief, if one may so
express it, from this dark and gloomy background of despair.A young man of about eighteen or twenty, with shiny black hair, copper
<DW52> complexion, and perfectly regular and handsome features,
contemplated this scene of dismay and horror with that sad calmness
peculiar to those who have often braved great perils; wrapped in a cloak,
he leaned his back against the bulwarks, with his feet resting against
one of the bulkheads.Suddenly, the unhappy mother, who, with her child
in her arms, and gold in her hand, had in vain addressed herself to
several of the mariners, to beg them to save her boy, perceiving the
young man with the copper-<DW52> complexion, threw herself on her knees
before him, and lifted her child towards him with a burst of
inexpressible agony.The young man took it, mournfully shook his head,
and pointed to the furious waves--but, with a meaning gesture, he
appeared to promise that he would at least try to save it.Then the young
mother, in a mad transport of hope, seized the hand of the youth, and
bathed it with her tears.Further on, another passenger of the "Black Eagle," seemed animated by
sentiments of the most active pity.One would hardly have given him
five-and-twenty years of age.His long, fair locks fell in curls on
either side of his angelic countenance.He wore a black cassock and white
neck-band.Applying himself to comfort the most desponding, he went from
one to the other, and spoke to them pious words of hope and resignation;
to hear him console some, and encourage others, in language full of
unction, tenderness, and ineffable charity, one would have supposed him
unaware or indifferent to the perils that he shared.On his fine, mild features, was impressed a calm and sacred intrepidity,
a religious abstraction from every terrestrial thought; from time to
time, he raised to heaven his large blue eyes, beaming with gratitude,
love, and serenity, as if to thank God for having called him to one of
those formidable trials in which the man of humanity and courage may
devote himself for his brethren, and, if not able to rescue them at all,
at least die with them, pointing to the sky.One might almost have taken
him for an angel, sent down to render less cruel the strokes of
inexorable fate.not far from this young man's angelic beauty, there was
another being, who resembled an evil spirit!Boldly mounted on what was left of the bowsprit, to which he held on by
means of some remaining cordage, this man looked down upon the terrible
scene that was passing on the deck.A grim, wild joy lighted up his
countenance of a dead yellow, that tint peculiar to those who spring from
the union of the white race with the East.He wore only a shirt and linen
drawers; from his neck was suspended, by a cord, a cylindrical tin box,
similar to that in which soldiers carry their leave of absence.The more the danger augmented, the nearer the ship came to the breakers,
or to a collision with the steamer, which she was now rapidly
approaching--a terrible collision, which would probably cause the two
vessels to founder before even they touched the rocks--the more did the
infernal joy of this passenger reveal itself in frightful transports.He
seemed to long, with ferocious impatience, for the moment when the work
of destruction should be accomplished.To see him thus feasting with
avidity on all the agony, the terror, and the despair of those around
him, one might have taken him for the apostle of one of those sanguinary
deities, who, in barbarous countries, preside over murder and carnage.By this time the "Black Eagle," driven by the wind and waves, came so
near the "William Tell" that the passengers on the deck of the nearly
dismantled steamer were visible from the first-named vessel.The heavy sea, which stove in
the paddle-box and broke one of the paddles, had also carried away nearly
the whole of the bulwarks on that side; the waves, entering every instant
by this large opening, swept the decks with irresistible violence, and
every time bore away with them some fresh victims.Amongst the passengers, who seemed only to have escaped this danger to be
hurled against the rocks, or crushed in the encounter of the two vessels,
one group was especially worthy of the most tender and painful interest.Taking refuge abaft, a tall old man, with bald forehead and gray
moustache, had lashed himself to a stanchion, by winding a piece of rope
round his body, whilst he clasped in his arms, and held fast to his
breast, two girls of fifteen or sixteen, half enveloped in a pelisse of
reindeer-skin.A large, fallow, Siberian dog, dripping with water, and
barking furiously at the waves, stood close to their feet.These girls, clasped in the arms of the old man, also pressed close to
each other; but, far from being lost in terror, they raised their eyes to
heaven, full of confidence and ingenuous hope, as though they expected to
be saved by the intervention of some supernatural power.A frightful shriek of horror and despair, raised by the passengers of
both vessels, was heard suddenly above the roar of the tempest.At the
moment when, plunging deeply between two waves, the broadside of the
steamer was turned towards the bows of the ship, the latter, lifted to a
prodigious height on a mountain of water, remained, as it were, suspended
over the "William Tell," during the second which preceded the shock of
the two vessels.There are sights of so sublime a horror, that it is impossible to
describe them.Yet, in the midst of these catastrophes, swift as thought,
one catches sometimes a momentary glimpse of a picture, rapid and
fleeting, as if illumined by a flash of lightning.Thus, when the "Black Eagle," poised aloft by the flood, was about to
crash down upon the "William Tell," the young man with the angelic
countenance and fair, waving locks bent over the prow of the ship, ready
to cast himself into the sea to save some victim.Suddenly, he perceived
on board the steamer, on which he looked down from the summit of the
immense wave, the two girls extending their arms towards him in
supplication.They appeared to recognize him, and gazed on him with a
sort of ecstacy and religious homage!For a second, in spite of the horrors of the tempest, in spite of the
approaching shipwreck, the looks of those three beings met.The features
of the young man were expressive of sudden and profound pity; for the
maidens with their hands clasped in prayer, seemed to invoke him as their
expected Saviour.The old man, struck down by the fall of a plank, lay
helpless on the deck.A fearful mass of water dashed the "Black Eagle" down upon the "William
Tell," in the midst of a cloud of boiling foam.To the dreadful crash of
the two great bodies of wood and iron, which splintering against one
another, instantly foundered, one loud cry was added--a cry of agony and
death--the cry of a hundred human creatures swallowed up at once by the
waves!A few moments after, the fragments of the two vessels appeared in the
trough of the sea, and on the caps of the waves--with here and there the
contracted arms, the livid and despairing faces of some unhappy wretches,
striving to make their way to the reefs along the shore, at the risk of
being crushed to death by the shock of the furious breakers.While the bailiff was gone to the sea-shore, to render help to those of
the passengers who might escape from the inevitable shipwreck, M. Rodin,
conducted by Catherine to the Green Chamber, had there found the articles
that he was to take with him to Paris.After passing two hours in this apartment, very indifferent to the fate
of the shipwrecked persons, which alone absorbed the attention of the
inhabitants of the Castle, Rodin returned to the chamber commonly
occupied by the bailiff, a room which opened upon a long gallery.When he
entered it he found nobody there.Under his arm he held a casket, with
silver fastenings, almost black from age, whilst one end of a large red
morocco portfolio projected from the breast-pocket of his half buttoned
great coat.Had the cold and livid countenance of the Abbe d'Aigrigny's secretary
been able to express joy otherwise than by a sarcastic smile, his
features would have been radiant with delight; for, just then, he was
under the influence of the most agreeable thoughts.Having placed the
casket upon a table, it was with marked satisfaction that he thus
communed with himself:

"All goes well.It was prudent to keep these papers here till this
moment, for one must always be on guard against the diabolical spirit of
that Adrienne de Cardoville, who appears to guess instinctively what it
is impossible she should know.Fortunately, the time approaches when we
shall have no more need to fear her.Her fate will be a cruel one; it
must be so.Those proud, independent characters are at all times our
natural enemies--they are so by their very essence--how much more when
they show themselves peculiarly hurtful and dangerous!As for La Sainte
Colombe, the bailiff is sure to act for us; between what the fool calls
his conscience, and the dread of being at his age deprived of a
livelihood, he will not hesitate.I wish to have him because he will
serve us better than a stranger; his having been here twenty years will
prevent all suspicion on the part of that dull and narrow-minded woman.Once in the hands of our man at Roiville, I will answer for the result.The course of all such gross and stupid women is traced beforehand: in
their youth, they serve the devil; in riper years, they make others serve
him; in their old age, they are horribly afraid of him; and this fear
must continue till she has left us the Chateau de Cardoville, which, from
its isolated position, will make us an excellent college.As for the affair of the medals, the 13th of February approaches,
without news from Joshua--evidently, Prince Djalma is still kept prisoner
by the English in the heart of India, or I must have received letters
from Batavia.The daughters of General Simon will be detained at Leipsic
for at least a month longer.All our foreign relations are in the best
condition.As for our internal affairs--"

 Here M. Rodin was interrupted in the current of his reflections by the
entrance of Madame Dupont, who was zealously engaged in preparations to
give assistance in case of need."Now," said she to the servant, "light a fire in the next room; put this
warm wine there; your master may be in every minute.""Well, my dear madam," said Rodin to her, "do they hope to save any of
these poor creatures?"He is so courageous, so imprudent, if
once he thinks he can be of any service.""Courageous even to imprudence," said Rodin to himself, impatiently; "I
do not like that.""Well," resumed Catherine, "I have here at hand my hot linen, my
cordials--heaven grant it may all be of use!""We may at least hope so, my dear madam.I very much regretted that my
age and weakness did not permit me to assist your excellent husband.I
also regret not being able to wait for the issue of his exertions, and to
wish him joy if successful--for I am unfortunately compelled to depart,
my moments are precious.I shall be much obliged if you will have the
carriage got ready.""Yes, Sir; I will see about it directly.""One word, my dear, good Madame Dupont.You are a woman of sense, and
excellent judgment.Now I have put your husband in the way to keep, if he
will, his situation as bailiff of the estate--"

"Is it possible?Without this place
what would become of us at our time of life?""I have only saddled my promise with two conditions--mere trifles--he
will explain all that to you."we shall regard you as our deliverer."Only, on two little conditions--"

"If there were a hundred, sir we should gladly accept them.Think what we
should be without this place--penniless--absolutely penniless!""I reckon upon you then; for the interest of your husband, you will try
to persuade him."here's master come back," cried a servant,
rushing into the chamber."No, missus; he is alone."A few moments after, M. Dupont entered the room; his clothes were
streaming with water; to keep his hat on in the midst of the storm, he
had tied it down to his head by means of his cravat, which was knotted
under his chin; his gaiters were covered with chalky stains."There I have thee, my dear love!"cried his wife, tenderly embracing
him."Up to the present moment--THREE SAVED."said Rodin; "at least your efforts
will not have been all in vain.""I only speak of those I saw myself, near the little creek of Goelands.Let us hope there may be more saved on other parts of the coast.""Yes, indeed; happily, the shore is not equally steep in all parts.""And where are these interesting sufferers, my dear sir?"asked Rodin,
who could not avoid remaining a few instants longer."They are mounting the cliffs, supported by our people.As they cannot
walk very fast, I ran on before to console my wife, and to take the
necessary measures for their reception.First of all, my dear, you must
get ready some women's clothes.""There is then a woman amongst the persons saved?""There are two girls--fifteen or sixteen years of age at the most--mere
children--and so pretty!"said Rodin, with an affectation of interest."The person to whom they owe their lives is with them."Yes; only fancy--"

"You can tell me all this by and by.Just slip on this dry warm
dressing-gown, and take some of this hot wine."I'll not refuse, for I am almost frozen to death.I was telling you that
the person who saved these young girls was a hero; and certainly his
courage was beyond anything one could have imagined.When I left here
with the men of the farm, we descended the little winding path, and
arrived at the foot of the cliff--near the little creek of Goelands,
fortunately somewhat sheltered from the waves by five or six enormous
masses of rock stretching out into the sea.Why, the two young girls I spoke of, in a swoon, with their feet
still in the water, and their bodies resting against a rock, as though
they had been placed there by some one, after being withdrawn from the
sea."said M. Rodin, raising, as usual,
the tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as though to
dry a tear, which was very seldom visible."What struck me was their great resemblance to each other," resumed the
bailiff; "only one in the habit of seeing them could tell the
difference.""Twin--sisters, no doubt," said Madame Dupont."One of the poor things," continued the bailiff, "held between her
clasped hands a little bronze medal, which was suspended from her neck by
a chain of the same material."Rodin generally maintained a very stooping posture; but at these last
words of the bailiff, he drew himself up suddenly, whilst a faint color
spread itself over his livid cheeks.In any other person, these symptoms
would have appeared of little consequence; but in Rodin, accustomed for
long years to control and dissimulate his emotions, they announced no
ordinary excitement.Approaching the bailiff, he said to him in a
slightly agitated voice, but still with an air of indifference: "It was
doubtless a pious relic.Did you see what was inscribed on this medal?""No, sir; I did not think of it.""And the two young girls were like one another--very much like, you say?""So like, that one would hardly know which was which.Probably they are
orphans, for they are dressed in mourning."said M. Rodin, with another start."As they had fainted away, we carried them further on to a place where
the sand was quite dry.While we were busy about this, we saw the head of
a man appear from behind one of the rocks, which he was trying to climb,
clinging to it by one hand; we ran to him, and luckily in the nick of
time, for he was clean worn out, and fell exhausted into the arms of our
men.It was of him I spoke when I talked of a hero; for, not content with
having saved the two young girls by his admirable courage, he had
attempted to rescue a third person, and had actually gone back amongst
the rocks and breakers--but his strength failed him, and, without the aid
of our men, he would certainly have been washed away from the ridge to
which he clung."Rodin, with his head bowed upon his breast, seemed quite indifferent to
this conversation.The dismay and stupor, in which he had been plunged,
only increased upon reflection.The two girls, who had just been saved,
were fifteen years of age; were dressed in mourning; were so like, that
one might be taken for the other; one of them wore round her neck a chain
with a bronze medal; he could scarcely doubt that they were the daughters
of General Simon.But how could those sisters be amongst the number of
shipwrecked passengers?How could they have escaped from the prison at
Leipsic?How did it happen, that he had not been informed of it?Could
they have fled, or had they been set at liberty?How was it possible that
he should not be apprise of such an event?But these secondary thoughts,
which offered themselves in crowds to the mind of M. Rodin, were
swallowed up in the one fact: "the daughters of General Simon are
here!"--His plan, so laboriously laid, was thus entirely destroyed."When I speak of the deliverer of these young girls," resumed the
bailiff, addressing his wife, and without remarking M. Rodin's absence of
mind, "you are expecting no doubt to see a Hercules?--well, he is
altogether the reverse.He is almost a boy in look, with fair, sweet
face, and light, curling locks.I left him a cloak to cover him, for he
had nothing on but his shirt, black knee-breeches, and a pair of black
worsted stockings--which struck me as singular.""Why, it was certainly not a sailor's dress.""Besides, though the ship was English, I believe my hero is a Frenchman,
for he speaks our language as well as we do.What brought the tears to my
eyes, was to see the young girls, when they came to themselves.As soon
as they saw him, they threw themselves at his feet, and seemed to look up
to him and thank him, as one would pray.Then they cast their eyes around
them, as if in search of some other person, and, having exchanged a few
words, they fell sobbing into each other's arms."How many poor creatures must have
perished!""When we quitted the rocks, the sea had already cast ashore seven dead
bodies, besides fragments of the wrecks, and packages.I spoke to some of
the coast-guard, and they will remain all day on the look-out; and if, as
I hope, any more should escape with life, they are to be brought here.But surely that is the sound of voices!--yes, it is our shipwrecked
guests!"The bailiff and his wife ran to the door of the room--that door, which
opened on the long gallery--whilst Rodin, biting convulsively his flat
nails, awaited with angry impatience the arrival of the strangers.A
touching picture soon presented itself to his view.From the end of the dark some gallery, only lighted on one side by
several windows, three persons, conducted by a peasant, advanced slowly.This group consisted of the two maidens, and the intrepid young man to
whom they owed their lives.Rose and Blanche were on either side of their
deliverer, who, walking with great difficulty, supported himself lightly
on their arms.Though he was full twenty-five years of age, the juvenile countenance of
this man made him appear younger.His long, fair hair, parted on the
forehead, streamed wet and smooth over the collar of a large brown cloak,
with which he had been covered.It would be difficult to describe the
adorable expression of goodness in his pale, mild face, as pure as the
most ideal creations of Raphael's pencil--for that divine artist alone
could have caught the melancholy grace of those exquisite features, the
serenity of that celestial look, from eyes limpid and blue as those of an
archangel, or of a martyr ascended to the skies.for a blood-red halo already encircled that beauteous
head.just above his light eyebrows, and rendered
still more visible by the effect of the cold, a narrow cicatrix, from a
wound inflicted many months before, appeared to encompass his fair
forehead with a purple band; and (still more sad!)his hands had been
cruelly pierced by a crucifixion--his feet had suffered the same
injury--and, if he now walked with so much difficulty, it was that his
wounds had reopened, as he struggled over the sharp rocks.This young man was Gabriel, the priest attached to the foreign mission,
the adopted son of Dagobert's wife.He was a priest and martyr--for, in
our days, there are still martyrs, as in the time when the Caesars flung
the early Christians to the lions and tigers of the circus.Yes, in our days, the children of the people--for it is almost always
amongst them that heroic and disinterested devotion may still be
found--the children of the people, led by an honorable conviction,
because it is courageous and sincere, go to all parts of the world, to
try and propagate their faith, and brave both torture and death with the
most unpretending valor.How many of them, victims of some barbarous tribe, have perished, obscure
and unknown, in the midst of the solitudes of the two worlds!--And for
these humble soldiers of the cross, who have nothing but their faith and
their intrepidity, there is never reserved on their return (and they
seldom do return) the rich and sumptuous dignities of the church.Never
does the purple or the mitre conceal their scarred brows and mutilated
limbs; like the great majority of other soldiers, they die forgotten.[8]

In their ingenuous gratitude, the daughters of General Simon, as soon as
they recovered their senses after the shipwreck, and felt themselves able
to ascend the cliffs, would not leave to any other person the care of
sustaining the faltering steps of him who had rescued them from certain
death.The black garments of Rose and Blanche streamed with water; their faces
were deadly pale, and expressive of deep grief; the marks of recent tears
were on their cheeks, and, with sad, downcast eyes, they trembled both
from agitation and cold, as the agonizing thought recurred to them, that
they should never again see Dagobert, their friend and guide; for it was
to him that Gabriel had stretched forth a helping hand, to assist him to
climb the rocks.Unfortunately the strength of both had failed, and the
soldier had been carried away by a retreating wave.The sight of Gabriel was a fresh surprise for Rodin, who had retired on
one side, in order to observe all; but this surprise was of so pleasant a
nature, and he felt so much joy in beholding the missionary safe after
such imminent peril, that the painful impression, caused by the view of
General Simon's daughters, was a little softened.It must not be
forgotten, that the presence of Gabriel in Paris, on the 13th of
February, was essential to the success of Rodin's projects.The bailiff and his wife, who were greatly moved at sight of the orphans,
approached them with eagerness.Just then a farm-boy entered the room,
crying: "Sir!good news--two more saved from the wreck!""Blessing and praise to God for it!"asked the bailiff, hastening towards the door."There is one who can walk, and is following behind me with Justin; the
other was wounded against the rocks, and they are carrying him on a
litter made of branches.""I will run and have him placed in the room below," said the bailiff, as
he went out."Catherine, you can look to the young ladies.""And the shipwrecked man who can walk--where is he?""Here he is," said the peasant, pointing to some one who came rapidly
along the gallery; "when he heard that the two young ladies were safe in
the chateau--though he is old, and wounded in the head, he took such
great strides, that it was all I could do to get here before him."Hardly had the peasant pronounced these words, when Rose and Blanche,
springing up by a common impulse, flew to the door.They arrived there at
the same moment as Dagobert.The soldier, unable to utter a syllable, fell on his knees at the
threshold, and extended his arms to the daughters of General Simon; while
Spoil-sport, running to them licked their hands.But the emotion was too much for Dagobert; and, when he had clasped the
orphans in his arms, his head fell backward, and he would have sunk down
altogether, but for the care of the peasants.In spite of the
observations of the bailiff's wife, on their state of weakness and
agitation, the two young girls insisted on accompanying Dagobert, who was
carried fainting into an adjoining apartment.At sight of the soldier, Rodin's face was again violently contracted, for
he had till then believed that the guide of General Simon's daughters was
dead.The missionary, worn out with fatigue, was leaning upon a chair,
and had not yet perceived Rodin.A new personage, a man with a dead yellow complexion, now entered the
room, accompanied by another peasant, who pointed out Gabriel to him.This man, who had just borrowed a smock-frock and a pair of trousers,
approached the missionary, and said to him in French but with a foreign
accent: "Prince Djalma has just been brought in here.His first word was
to ask for you."cried Rodin, in a voice of thunder; for, at the
name of Djalma, he had sprung with one bound to Gabriel's side.exclaimed the missionary, falling back in surprise."M. Rodin," cried the other shipwrecked person; and from that moment, he
kept his eye fixed on the correspondent of M. Van Dael.said Gabriel, approaching Rodin with an air of
deference, not unmixed with fear.repeated Rodin, in an excited tone."Did
he not utter the name of Prince Djalma?""Yes, sir; Prince Djalma was one of the passengers on board the English
ship, which came from Alexandria, and in which we have just been wrecked.This vessel touched at the Azores, where I then was; the ship that
brought me from Charlestown having been obliged to put in there, and
being likely to remain for some time, on account of serious damage, I
embarked on board the 'Black Eagle,' where I met Prince Djalma.We were
bound to Portsmouth, and from thence my intention was to proceed to
France."This new shock had completely
paralyzed his thoughts.At length, like a man who catches at a last hope,
which he knows beforehand to be vain, he said to Gabriel: "Can you tell
me who this Prince Djalma is?""A young man as good as brave--the son of an East Indian king,
dispossessed of his territory by the English."Then, turning towards the other shipwrecked man, the missionary said to
him with anxious interest: "How is the Prince?"They are serious contusions, but they will not be mortal," answered the
other.said the missionary, addressing Rodin; "here, you
see, is another saved.""So much the better," observed Rodin, in a quick, imperious tone."I will go see him," said Gabriel, submissively."You have no orders to
give me?""Will you be able to leave this place in two or three hours,
notwithstanding your fatigue?"Gabriel only bowed in reply, and Rodin sank confounded into a chair,
while the missionary went out with the peasant.The man with the sallow
complexion still lingered in a corner of the room, unperceived by Rodin.This man was Faringhea, the half-caste, one of the three chiefs of the
Stranglers.Having escaped the pursuit of the soldiers in the ruins of
Tchandi, he had killed Mahal the Smuggler, and robbed him of the
despatches written by M. Joshua Van Dael to Rodin, as also of the letter
by which the smuggler was to have been received as passenger on board the
"Ruyter."When Faringhea left the hut in the ruins of Tchandi, he had not
been seen by Djalma; and the latter, when he met him on shipboard, after
his escape (which we shall explain by and by), not knowing that he
belonged to the sect of Phansegars, treated him during the voyage as a
fellow-countryman.Rodin, with his eye fixed and haggard, his countenance of a livid hue,
biting his nails to the quick in silent rage, did not perceive the half
caste, who quietly approached him and laying his hand familiarly on his
shoulder, said to him: "Your name is Rodin?"asked the other, starting, and raising his head abruptly."You live in the Rue du Milieu-des-Ursins, Paris?"But, once more, what do you want?""Nothing now, brother: hereafter, much!"And Faringhea, retiring, with slow steps, left Rodin alarmed at what had
passed; for this man, who scarcely trembled at anything, had quailed
before the dark look and grim visage of the Strangler.[8] We always remember with emotion the end of a letter written, two or
three years ago, by one of these young and valiant missionaries, the son
of poor parents in Beauce.He was writing to his mother from the heart of
Japan, and thus concluded his letter: "Adieu, my dear mother!they say
there is much danger where I am now sent to.Pray for me, and tell all
our good neighbors that I think of them very often."These few words,
addressed from the centre of Asia to poor peasants in a hamlet of France,
are only the more touching from their very simplicity--E. S.




CHAPTER XXVI.The most profound silence reigns throughout Cardoville House.The tempest
has lulled by degrees, and nothing is heard from afar but the hoarse
murmur of the waves, as they wash heavily the shore.Dagobert and the orphans have been lodged in warm and comfortable
apartments on the first-floor of the chateau.Djalma, too severely hurt
to be carried upstairs, has remained in a room below.At the moment of
the shipwreck, a weeping mother had placed her child in his arms.He had
failed in the attempt to snatch this unfortunate infant from certain
death, but his generous devotion had hampered his movements, and when
thrown upon the rocks, he was almost dashed to pieces.Faringhea, who has
been able to convince him of his affection, remains to watch over him.Gabriel, after administering consolation to Djalma, has rescinded to the
chamber allotted to him; faithful to the promise he made to Rodin, to be
ready to set out in two hours, he has not gone to bed; but, having dried
his clothes, he has fallen asleep in a large, high-backed arm-chair,
placed in front of a bright coal-fire.His apartment is situated near
those occupied by Dagobert and the two sisters.Spoil-sport, probably quite at his ease in so respectable a dwelling, has
quitted the door of Rose and Blanche's chamber, to lie down and warm
himself at the hearth, by the side of which the missionary is sleeping.There, with his nose resting on his outstretched paws, he enjoys a
feeling of perfect comfort and repose, after so many perils by land and
sea.We will not venture to affirm, that he thinks habitually of poor old
Jovial; unless we recognize as a token of remembrance on his part, his
irresistible propensity to bite all the white horses he has met with,
ever since the death of his venerable companion, though before, he was
the most inoffensive of dogs with regard to horses of every color.Presently one of the doors of the chamber opened, and the two sisters
entered timidly.Awake for some minutes, they had risen and dressed
themselves, feeling still some uneasiness with respect to Dagobert;
though the bailiff's wife, after showing them to their room, had returned
again to tell them that the village doctor found nothing serious in the
hurt of the old soldier, still they hoped to meet some one belonging to
the chateau, of whom they could make further inquiries about him.The high back of the old-fashioned arm-chair, in which Gabriel was
sleeping, completely screened him from view; but the orphans, seeing
their canine friend lying quietly at his feet, thought it was Dagobert
reposing there, and hastened towards him on tip-toe.To their great
astonishment, they saw Gabriel fast asleep, and stood still in confusion,
not daring to advance or recede, for fear of waking him.The long, light hair of the missionary was no longer wet, and now curled
naturally round his neck and shoulders; the paleness of his complexion
was the more striking, from the contrast afforded by the deep purple of
the damask covering of the arm-chair.His beautiful countenance expressed
a profound melancholy, either caused by the influence of some painful
dream, or else that he was in the habit of keeping down, when awake, some
sad regrets, which revealed themselves without his knowledge when he was
sleeping.Notwithstanding this appearance of bitter grief, his features
preserved their character of angelic sweetness, and seemed endowed with
an inexpressible charm, for nothing is more touching than suffering
goodness.The two young girls cast down their eyes, blushed
simultaneously, and exchanged anxious glances, as if to point out to each
other the slumbering missionary."He sleeps, sister," said Rose in a low voice."So much the better," replied Blanche, also in a whisper, making a sign
of caution; "we shall now be able to observe him well.""Yes, for we durst not do so, in coming from the sea hither.""He is just the same as we saw him in our dreams.""But here, at least, he is visible.""Not as it was in the prison at Leipsic, during that dark night.""And so--he has again rescued us.""Without him, we should have perished this morning.""And yet, sister, it seems to me, that in our dreams his countenance
shone with light.""Yes, you know it dazzled us to look at him.""And then he had not so sad a mien.""That was because he came then from heaven; now he is upon earth.""But, sister, had he then that bright red scar round his forehead?""If he has been wounded, how can he be an archangel?"If he received those wounds in preventing evil, or in
helping the unfortunate, who, like us, were about to perish?"If he did not run any danger for those he protects, it
would be less noble.""What a pity that he does not open his eye!""Their expression is so good, so tender!""Why did he not speak of our mother, by the way?""We were not alone with him; he did not like to do so.""If we were to pray to him to speak to us?"The orphans looked doubtingly at each other, with charming simplicity; a
bright glow suffused their cheeks, and their young bosoms heaved gently
beneath their black dresses.said Blanche, believing rightly, that
Rose felt exactly as she did."And yet it seems to do us good.It is as
if some happiness were going to befall us."The sisters, having approached the arm-chair on tip-toe, knelt down with
clasped hands, one to the right the other to the left of the young
priest.Turning their lovely faces towards
him, they said in a low whisper, with a soft, sweet voice, well suited to
their youthful appearance: "Gabriel!On this appeal, the missionary gave a slight start, half-opened his eyes,
and, still in a state of semi-consciousness, between sleep and waking,
beheld those two beauteous faces turned towards him, and heard two gentle
voices repeat his name.said he, rousing himself, and raising his head.It was now Gabriel's turn to blush, for he recognized the young girls he
had saved.said he to them; "you should kneel only
unto God."The orphans obeyed, and were soon beside him, holding each other by the
hand."You know my name, it seems," said the missionary with a smile."Yes--when you came from our mother."said the missionary, unable to comprehend the words of
the orphans.I saw you to-day for the first time.""Yes--do you not remember?--in our dreams.""In Germany--three months ago, for the first time.Gabriel could not help smiling at the simplicity of Rose and Blanche, who
expected him to remember a dream of theirs; growing more and more
perplexed, he repeated: "In your dreams?""Certainly; when you gave us such good advice.""And when we were so sorrowful in prison, your words, which we
remembered, consoled us, and gave us courage.""Was it not you, who delivered us from the prison at Leipsic, in that
dark night, when we were not able to see you?""What other but you would thus have come to our help, and to that of our
old friend?""We told him, that you would love him, because he loved us, although he
would not believe in angels.""And this morning, during the tempest, we had hardly any fear.""This morning--yes, my sisters--it pleased heaven to send me to your
assistance.I was coming from America, but I have never been in Leipsic.I could not, therefore, have let you out of prison.Tell me, my sisters,"
added he, with a benevolent smile, "for whom do you take me?""For a good angel whom we have seen already in dreams, sent by our mother
from heaven to protect us.""My dear sisters, I am only a poor priest.It is by mere chance, no
doubt, that I bear some resemblance to the angel you have seen in your
dreams, and whom you could not see in any other manner--for angels are
not visible to mortal eye.said the orphans, looking sorrowfully at each
other."No matter, my dear sisters," said Gabriel, taking them affectionately by
the hand; "dreams, like everything else, come from above.Since the
remembrance of your mother was mixed up with this dream, it is twice
blessed."At this moment a door opened, and Dagobert made his appearance.Up to
this time, the orphans, in their innocent ambition to be protected by an
archangel, had quite forgotten the circumstance that Dagobert's wife had
adopted a forsaken child, who was called Gabriel, and who was now a
priest and missionary.The soldier, though obstinate in maintaining that his hurt was only a
blank wound (to use a term of General Simon's), had allowed it to be
carefully dressed by the surgeon of the village, and now wore a black
bandage, which concealed one half of his forehead, and added to the
natural grimness of his features.On entering the room, he was not a
little surprised to see a stranger holding the hands of Rose and Blanche
familiarly in his own.This surprise was natural, for Dagobert did not
know that the missionary had saved the lives of the orphans, and had
attempted to save his also.In the midst of the storm, tossed about by the waves, and vainly striving
to cling to the rocks, the soldier had only seen Gabriel very
imperfectly, at the moment when, having snatched the sisters from certain
death, the young priest had fruitlessly endeavored to come to his aid.And when, after the shipwreck, Dagobert had found the orphans in safety
beneath the roof of the Manor House, he fell, as we have already stated,
into a swoon, caused by fatigue, emotion, and the effects of his
wound--so that he had again no opportunity of observing the features of
the missionary.The veteran began to frown from beneath his black bandage and thick, gray
brows, at beholding a stranger so familiar with Rose and Blanche; but the
sisters ran to throw themselves into his arms, and to cover him with
filial caresses.His anger was soon dissipated by these marks of
affection, though he continued, from time to time, to cast a suspicious
glance at the missionary, who had risen from his seat, but whose
countenance he could not well distinguish."They told us it was not
dangerous.""No, children; the surgeon of the village would bandage me up in this
manner.If my head was carbonadoes with sabre cuts, I could not have more
wrappings.They will take me for an old milksop; it is only a blank
wound, and I have a good mind to--" And therewith the soldier raised one
of his hands to the bandage."How can you be
so unreasonable--at your age?"I will do what you wish, and keep it on."Then,
drawing the sisters to one end of the room, he said to them in a low
voice, whilst he looked at the young priest from the corner of his eye:
"Who is that gentleman who was holding your hands when I came in?He has
very much the look of a curate.You see, my children, you must be on your
guard; because--"

"He?"cried both sisters at once, turning towards Gabriel."Without him,
we should not now be here to kiss you."cried the soldier, suddenly drawing up his tall figure,
and gazing full at the missionary."It is our guardian angel," resumed Blanche."Without him," said Rose, "we must have perished this morning in the
shipwreck."it is he, who--" Dagobert could say no more.With swelling heart,
and tears in his eyes, he ran to the missionary, offered him both his
hands, and exclaimed in a tone of gratitude impossible to describe: "Sir,
I owe you the lives of these two children.I feel what a debt that
service lays upon me.I will not say more--because it includes
everything!"Then, as if struck with a sudden recollection, he cried: "Stop!when I
was trying to cling to a rock, so as not to be carried away by the waves,
was it not you that held out your hand to me?Yes--that light hair--that
youthful countenance--yes--it was certainly you--now I am sure of it!""Unhappily, sir, my strength failed me, and I had the anguish to see you
fall back into the sea.""I can say nothing more in the way of thanks than what I have already
said," answered Dagobert, with touching simplicity: "in preserving these
children you have done more for me than if you had saved my own life.added the soldier, with admiration; "and so
young, with such a girlish look!""And so," cried Blanche, joyfully, "our Gabriel came to your aid also?"said Dagobert interrupting Blanche, and addressing himself to
the priest.repeated the soldier, more and more surprised.asked the soldier, with increasing
astonishment."An excellent and generous woman, whom I revere as the best of mothers:
for she had pity on me, a deserted infant, and treated me ever as her
son.""Frances Baudoin--was it not?""It was, sir," answered Gabriel, astonished in his turn."Yes, of a brave soldier--who, from the most admirable devotion, is even
now passing his life in exile--far from his wife--far from his son, my
dear brother--for I am proud to call him by that name--"

"My Agricola!--my wife!--when did you leave them?"You the father of Agricola?--Oh!I knew not, until
now," cried Gabriel, clasping his hands together, "I knew not all the
gratitude that I owed to heaven!"resumed Dagobert, in a trembling voice; "how are
they?"The accounts I received, three months ago, were excellent.""No; it is too much," cried Dagobert; "it is too much!"The veteran was
unable to proceed; his feelings stifled his words, and fell back
exhausted in a chair.And now Rose and Blanche recalled to mind that portion of their father's
letter which related to the child named Gabriel, whom the wife of
Dagobert had adopted; then they also yielded to transports of innocent
joy."Our Gabriel is the same as yours--what happiness!"he belongs to you as well as to me.Then, addressing Gabriel, the soldier added with
affectionate warmth: "Your hand, my brave boy!"Yes--that's it--thank me!--after all thou has done for us!""Does my adopted mother know of your return?"asked Gabriel, anxious to
escape from the praises of the soldier."I wrote to her five months since, but said that I should come alone;
there was a reason for it, which I will explain by and by.Does she still
live in the Rue Brise-Miche?"In that case, she must have received my letter.I wished to write to her
from the prison at Leipsic, but it was impossible.""Yes; I come straight from Germany, by the Elbe and Hamburg, and I should
be still at Leipsic, but for an event which the Devil must have had a
hand in--a good sort of devil, though.""That would be difficult, for I cannot explain it to myself.These little
ladies," he added, pointing with a smile to Rose and Blanche, "pretended
to know more about it than I did, and were continually repeating: 'It was
the angel that came to our assistance, Dagobert--the good angel we told
thee of--though you said you would rather have Spoil sport to defend
us--'"

"Gabriel, I am waiting for you," said a stern voice, which made the
missionary start.They all turned round instantly, whilst the dog uttered
a deep growl.He stood in the doorway leading to the corridor.His
features were calm and impassive, but he darted a rapid, piercing glance
at the soldier and sisters.said Dagobert, very little prepossessed in favor of
Rodin, whose countenance he found singularly repulsive."What the
mischief does he want?""I must go with him," answered Gabriel, in a tone of sorrowful
constraint.Then, turning to Rodin, he added: "A thousand pardons!cried Dagobert, stupefied with amazement, "going the very instant
we have just met?I have too much to
tell you, and to ask in return.It
will be a real treat for me."He is my superior, and I must obey him.""Your superior?--why, he's in citizen's dress.""He is not obliged to wear the ecclesiastical garb."since he is not in uniform, and there is no provost-marshal in
your troop, send him to the--"

"Believe me, I would not hesitate a minute, if it were possible to
remain.""I was right in disliking the phi of that man," muttered Dagobert between
his teeth.Then he added, with an air of impatience and vexation: "Shall
I tell him that he will much oblige us by marching off by himself?""I beg you not to do so," said Gabriel; "it would be useless; I know my
duty, and have no will but my superior's.As soon as you arrive in Paris,
I will come and see you, as also my adopted mother, and my dear brother,
Agricola."I have been a soldier, and know what subordination
is," said Dagobert, much annoyed."One must put a good face on bad
fortune.So, the day after to-morrow, in the Rue Brise-Miche, my boy; for
they tell me I can be in Paris by to-morrow evening, and we set out
almost immediately.But I say--there seems to be a strict discipline with
you fellows!""Yes, it is strict and severe," answered Gabriel, with a shudder, and a
stifled sigh."Come, shake hands--and let's say farewell for the present.After all,
twenty-four hours will soon pass away."replied the missionary, much moved, whilst he returned
the friendly pressure of the veteran's hand.added the orphans, sighing also, and with tears in
their eyes.said Gabriel--and he left the room with Rodin, who
had not lost a word or an incident of this scene.Two hours after, Dagobert and the orphans had quitted the Castle for
Paris, not knowing that Djalma was left at Cardoville, being still too
much injured to proceed on his journey.The half-caste, Faringhea,
remained with the young prince, not wishing, he said, to desert a fellow
countryman.We now conduct the reader to the Rue Brise-Miche, the residence of
Dagobert's wife.The following scenes occur in Paris, on the morrow of the day when the
shipwrecked travellers were received in Cardoville House.Nothing can be more gloomy than the aspect of the Rue Brise-Miche, one
end of which leads into the Rue Saint-Merry, and the other into the
little square of the Cloister, near the church.At this end, the street,
or rather alley--for it is not more than eight feet wide--is shut in
between immense black, muddy dilapidated walls, the excessive height of
which excludes both air and light; hardly, during the longest days of the
year, is the sun able to throw into it a few straggling beams; whilst,
during the cold damps of winter, a chilling fog, which seems to penetrate
everything, hangs constantly above the miry pavement of this species of
oblong well.It was about eight o'clock in the evening; by the faint, reddish light of
the street lamp, hardly visible through the haze, two men, stopping at
the angle of one of those enormous walls, exchanged a few words together."So," said one, "you understand all about it.You are to watch in the
street, till you see them enter No."And when you see 'em enter so as to make quite sure of the game, go up
to Frances Baudoin's room--"

"Under the cloak of asking where the little humpbacked workwoman
lives--the sister of that gay girl, the Queen of the Bacchanals.""Yes--and you must try and find out her address also--from her humpbacked
sister, if possible--for it is very important.Women of her feather
change their nests like birds, and we have lost track of her.""Make yourself easy; I will do my best with Hump, to learn where her
sister hangs out.""And, to give you steam, I'll wait for you at the tavern opposite the
Cloister, and we'll have a go of hot wine on your return.""I'll not refuse, for the night is deucedly cold."This morning the water friz on my sprinkling-brush,
and I turned as stiff as a mummy in my chair at the church-door.a distributor of holy water is not always upon roses!""Luckily, you have the pickings--"

"Well, well--good luck to you!Don't forget the Fiver, the little passage
next to the dyer's shop."One proceeded to the Cloister Square; the other towards the further end
of the street, where it led into the Rue Saint-Merry.This latter soon
found the number of the house he sought--a tall, narrow building, having,
like all the other houses in the street, a poor and wretched appearance.When he saw he was right, the man commenced walking backwards and
forwards in front of the door of No.If the exterior of these buildings was uninviting, the gloom and squalor
of the interior cannot be described.5 was, in a special
degree, dirty and dilapidated.The water, which oozed from the wall,
trickled down the dark and filthy staircase.On the second floor, a wisp
of straw had been laid on the narrow landing-place, for wiping the feet
on; but this straw, being now quite rotten, only served to augment the
sickening odor, which arose from want of air, from damp, and from the
putrid exhalations of the drains.The few openings, cut at rare intervals
in the walls of the staircase, could hardly admit more than some faint
rays of glimmering light.In this quarter, one of the most populous in Paris, such houses as these,
poor, cheerless, and unhealthy, are generally inhabited by the working
classes.A dyer occupied the
ground floor; the deleterious vapors arising from his vats added to the
stench of the whole building.On the upper stories, several artisans
lodged with their families, or carried on their different trades.Up four
flights of stairs was the lodging of Frances Baudoin, wife of Dagobert.It consisted of one room, with a closet adjoining, and was now lighted by
a single candle.Agricola occupied a garret in the roof.Old grayish paper, broken here and there by the cracks covered the crazy
wall, against which rested the bed; scanty curtains, running upon an iron
rod, concealed the windows; the brick floor, not polished, but often
washed, had preserved its natural color.At one end of this room was a
round iron stove, with a large pot for culinary purposes.On the wooden
table, painted yellow, marbled with brown, stood a miniature house made
of iron--a masterpiece of patience and skill, the work of Agricola
Baudoin, Dagobert's son.A plaster crucifix hung up against the wall, surrounded by several
branches of consecrated box-tree, and various images of saints, very
coarsely, bore witness to the habits of the soldier's wife.Between the windows stood one of those old walnut-wood presses, curiously
fashioned, and almost black with time; an old arm-chair, covered with
green cotton velvet (Agricola's first present to his mother), a few rush
bottomed chairs, and a worktable on which lay several bags of coarse,
brown cloth, completed the furniture of this room, badly secured by a
worm-eaten door.The adjoining closet contained a few kitchen and
household utensils.Mean and poor as this interior may perhaps appear, it would not seem so
to the greater number of artisans; for the bed was supplied with two
mattresses, clean sheets, and a warm counterpane; the old-fashioned press
contained linen; and, moreover, Dagobert's wife occupied all to herself a
room as large as those in which numerous families, belonging to honest
and laborious workmen, often live and sleep huddled together--only too
happy if the boys and girls can have separate beds, or if the sheets and
blankets are not pledged at the pawnbroker's.Frances Baudoin, seated beside the small stove, which, in the cold and
damp weather, yielded but little warmth, was busied in preparing her son
Agricola's evening meal.Dagobert's wife was about fifty years of age; she wore a close jacket of
blue cotton, with white flowers on it, and a stuff petticoat; a white
handkerchief was tied round her head, and fastened under the chin.Her
countenance was pale and meagre, the features regular, and expressive of
resignation and great kindness.It would have been difficult to find a
better, a more courageous mother.With no resource but her labor, she had
succeeded, by unwearied energy, in bringing up not only her own son
Agricola, but also Gabriel, the poor deserted child, of whom, with
admirable devotion, she had ventured to take charge.In her youth, she had, as it were, anticipated the strength of later
life, by twelve years of incessant toil, rendered lucrative by the most
violent exertions, and accompanied by such privations as made it almost
suicidal.Then (for it was a time of splendid wages, compared to the
present), by sleepless nights and constant labor, she contrived to earn
about two shillings (fifty sous) a day, and with this she managed to
educate her son and her adopted child.At the end of these twelve years, her health was ruined, and her strength
nearly exhausted; but, at all events, her boys had wanted for nothing,
and had received such an education as children of the people can obtain.About this time, M. Francois Hardy took Agricola as an apprentice, and
Gabriel prepared to enter the priest's seminary, under the active
patronage of M. Rodin, whose communications with the confessor of Frances
Baudoin had become very frequent about the year 1820.This woman (whose piety had always been excessive) was one of those
simple natures, endowed with extreme goodness, whose self-denial
approaches to heroism, and who devote themselves in obscurity to a life
of martyrdom--pure and heavenly minds, in whom the instincts of the heart
supply the place of the intellect!The only defect, or rather the necessary consequence of this extreme
simplicity of character, was the invincible determination she displayed
in yielding to the commands of her confessor, to whose influence she had
now for many years been accustomed to submit.She regarded this influence
as most venerable and sacred; no mortal power, no human consideration,
could have prevented her from obeying it.Did any dispute arise on the
subject, nothing could move her on this point; she opposed to every
argument a resistance entirely free from passion--mild as her
disposition, calm as her conscience--but, like the latter, not to be
shaken.In a word, Frances Baudoin was one of those pure, but
uninstructed and credulous beings, who may sometimes, in skillful and
dangerous hands, become, without knowing it, the instruments of much
evil.For some time past, the bad state of her health, and particularly the
increasing weakness of her sight, had condemned her to a forced repose;
unable to work more than two or three hours a day, she consumed the rest
of her time at church.Frances rose from her seat, pushed the coarse bags at which she had been
working to the further end of the table, and proceeded to lay the cloth
for her son's supper, with maternal care and solicitude.She took from
the press a small leathern bag, containing an old silver cup, very much
battered, and a fork and spoon, so worn and thin, that the latter cut
like a knife.These, her only plate (the wedding present of Dagobert) she
rubbed and polished as well as she was able, and laid by the side of her
son's plate.They were the most precious of her possessions, not so much
for what little intrinsic value might attach to them, as for the
associations they recalled; and she had often shed bitter tears, when,
under the pressure of illness or want of employment, she had been
compelled to carry these sacred treasures to the pawnbroker's.Frances next took, from the lower shelf of the press, a bottle of water,
and one of wine about three-quarters full, which she also placed near her
son's plate; she then returned to the stove, to watch the cooking of the
supper.Though Agricola was not much later than usual, the countenance of his
mother expressed both uneasiness and grief; one might have seen, by the
redness of her eyes, that she had been weeping a good deal.After long
and painful uncertainty, the poor woman had just arrived at the
conviction that her eyesight, which had been growing weaker and weaker,
would soon be so much impaired as to prevent her working even the two or
three hours a day which had lately been the extent of her labors.Originally an excellent hand at her needle, she had been obliged, as her
eyesight gradually failed her, to abandon the finer for the coarser sorts
of work, and her earnings had necessarily diminished in proportion; she
had at length been reduced to the necessity of making those coarse bags
for the army, which took about four yards of sewing, and were paid at the
rate of two sous each, she having to find her own thread.This work,
being very hard, she could at most complete three such bags in a day, and
her gains thus amounted to threepence (six sous)!It makes one shudder to think of the great number of unhappy females,
whose strength has been so much exhausted by privations, old age, or
sickness, that all the labor of which they are capable, hardly suffices
to bring them in daily this miserable pittance.Thus do their gains
diminish in exact proportion to the increasing wants which age and
infirmity must occasion.Happily, Frances had an efficient support in her son.A first-rate
workman, profiting by the just scale of wages adopted by M. Hardy, his
labor brought him from four to five shillings a day--more than double
what was gained by the workmen of many other establishments.Admitting
therefore that his mother were to gain nothing, he could easily maintain
both her and himself.But the poor woman, so wonderfully economical that she denied herself
even some of the necessaries of life, had of late become ruinously
liberal on the score of the sacristy, since she had adopted the habit of
visiting daily the parish church.Scarcely a day passed but she had
masses sung, or tapers burnt, either for Dagobert, from whom she had been
so long separated, or for the salvation of her son Agricola, whom she
considered on the high-road to perdition.Agricola had so excellent a
heart, so loved and revered his mother, and considered her actions in
this respect inspired by so touching a sentiment, that he never
complained when he saw a great part of his week's wages (which he paid
regularly over to his mother every Saturday) disappear in pious forms.Yet now and then he ventured to remark to Frances, with as much respect
as tenderness, that it pained him to see her enduring privations
injurious at her age, because she preferred incurring these devotional
expenses.But what answer could he make to this excellent mother, when
she replied with tears: "My child, 'tis for the salvation of your father
and yours too."To dispute the efficacy of masses, would have been venturing on a
subject which Agricola, through respect for his mother's religious faith,
never discussed.He contented himself, therefore, with seeing her
dispense with comforts she might have enjoyed.THE SISTER OF THE BACCHANAL QUEEN.The person who now entered was a girl of about eighteen, short, and very
much deformed.Though not exactly a hunchback, her spine was curved; her
breast was sunken, and her head deeply set in the shoulders.Her face was
regular, but long, thin, very pale, and pitted with the small pox; yet it
expressed great sweetness and melancholy.Her blue eyes beamed with
kindness and intelligence.By a strange freak of nature, the handsomest
woman would have been proud of the magnificent hair twisted in a coarse
net at the back of her head.Though
miserably clad, the care and neatness of her dress revealed a powerful
struggle with her poverty.Notwithstanding the cold, she wore a scanty
frock made of print of an indefinable color, spotted with white; but it
had been so often washed, that its primitive design and color had long
since disappeared.In her resigned, yet suffering face, might be read a
long familiarity with every form of suffering, every description of
taunting.From her birth, ridicule had ever pursued her.We have said
that she was very deformed, and she was vulgarly called "Mother Bunch."Indeed it was so usual to give her this grotesque name, which every
moment reminded her of her infirmity, that Frances and Agricola, though
they felt as much compassion as other people showed contempt for her,
never called her, however, by any other name.Mother Bunch, as we shall therefore call her in future, was born in the
house in which Dagobert's wife had resided for more than twenty years;
and she had, as it were, been brought up with Agricola and Gabriel.There are wretches fatally doomed to misery.Mother Bunch had a very
pretty sister, on whom Perrine Soliveau, their common mother, the widow
of a ruined tradesman, had concentrated all her affection, while she
treated her deformed child with contempt and unkindness.The latter would
often come, weeping, to Frances, on this account, who tried to console
her, and in the long evenings amused her by teaching her to read and sew.Accustomed to pity her by their mother's example, instead of imitating
other children, who always taunted and sometimes even beat her, Agricola
and Gabriel liked her, and used to protect and defend her.She was about fifteen, and her sister Cephyse was about seventeen, when
their mother died, leaving them both in utter poverty.Cephyse was
intelligent, active, clever, but different to her sister; she had the
lively, alert, hoydenish character which requires air, exercise and
pleasures--a good girl enough, but foolishly spoiled by her mother.Cephyse, listening at first to Frances's good advice, resigned herself to
her lot; and, having learnt to sew, worked like her sister, for about a
year.But, unable to endure any longer the bitter privations her
insignificant earnings, notwithstanding her incessant toil, exposed her
to--privations which often bordered on starvation--Cephyse, young,
pretty, of warm temperament, and surrounded by brilliant offers and
seductions--brilliant, indeed, for her, since they offered food to
satisfy her hunger, shelter from the cold, and decent raiment, without
being obliged to work fifteen hours a day in an obscure and unwholesome
hovel--Cephyse listened to the vows of a young lawyer's clerk, who
forsook her soon after.She formed a connection with another clerk, whom
she (instructed by the examples set her), forsook in turn for a bagman,
whom she afterwards cast off for other favorites.In a word, what with
changing and being forsaken, Cephyse, in the course of one or two years,
was the idol of a set of grisettes, students and clerks; and acquired
such a reputation at the balls on the Hampstead Heaths of Paris, by her
decision of character, original turn of mind, and unwearied ardor in all
kinds of pleasures, and especially her wild, noisy gayety, that she was
termed the Bacchanal Queen, and proved herself in every way worthy of
this bewildering royalty.From that time poor Mother Bunch only heard of her sister at rare
intervals.She still mourned for her, and continued to toil hard to gain
her three-and-six a week.The unfortunate girl, having been taught sewing
by Frances, made coarse shirts for the common people and the army.For
these she received half-a-crown a dozen.They had to be hemmed, stitched,
provided with collars and wristbands, buttons, and button holes; and at
the most, when at work twelve and fifteen hours a day, she rarely
succeeded in turning out more than fourteen or sixteen shirts a week--an
excessive amount of toil that brought her in about three shillings and
fourpence a week.And the case of this poor girl was neither accidental
nor uncommon.And this, because the remuneration given for women's work
is an example of revolting injustice and savage barbarism.They are paid
not half as much as men who are employed at the needle: such as tailors,
and makers of gloves, or waistcoats, etc.--no doubt because women can
work as well as men--because they are more weak and delicate--and because
their need may be twofold as great when they become mothers.Well, Mother Bunch fagged on, with three-and-four a week.That is to say,
toiling hard for twelve or fifteen hours every day; she succeeded in
keeping herself alive, in spite of exposure to hunger, cold, and
poverty--so numerous were her privations.The word
privation expresses but weakly that constant and terrible want of all
that is necessary to preserve the existence God gives; namely, wholesome
air and shelter, sufficient and nourishing food and warm clothing.Mortification would be a better word to describe that total want of all
that is essentially vital, which a justly organized state of society
ought--yes--ought necessarily to bestow on every active, honest workman
and workwoman, since civilization has dispossessed them of all
territorial right, and left them no other patrimony than their hands.The savage does not enjoy the advantage of civilization; but he has, at
least, the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the fish of the
sea, and the fruits of the earth, to feed him, and his native woods for
shelter and for fuel.The civilized man, disinherited of these gifts,
considering the rights of property as sacred, may, in return for his hard
daily labor, which enriches his country, demand wages that will enable
him to live in the enjoyment of health: nothing more, and nothing less.For is it living, to drag along on the extreme edge which separates life
from the grave, and even there continually struggle against cold, hunger,
and disease?And to show how far the mortification which society imposes
thus inexorably on its millions of honest, industrious laborers (by its
careless disregard of all the questions which concern the just
remuneration of labor), may extend, we will describe how this poor girl
contrived to live on three shillings and sixpence a week.Society, perhaps, may then feel its obligation to so many unfortunate
wretches for supporting, with resignation, the horrible existence which
leaves them just sufficient life to feel the worst pangs of humanity.Yes: to live at such a price is virtue!Yes, society thus organized,
whether it tolerates or imposes so much misery, loses all right to blame
the poor wretches who sell themselves not through debauchery, but because
they are cold and famishing.This poor girl spent her wages as follows:

    Six pounds of bread, second quality..0 8 1/2
    Four pails of water..0 2
    Lard or dripping (butter being out of the question)0 5
    Coarse salt..0 0 3/4

To save charcoal, Mother Bunch prepared soup only two or three times a
week at most, on a stove that stood on the landing of the fourth story.There remained nine or ten pence a week
for clothes and lodging.By rare good fortune, her situation was in one
respect an exception to the lot of many others.Agricola, that he might
not wound her delicacy, had come to a secret arrangement with the
housekeeper, and hired a garret for her, just large enough to hold a
small bed, a chair, and a table; for which the sempstress had to pay five
shillings a year.But Agricola, in fulfilment of his agreement with the
porter, paid the balance, to make up the actual rent of the garret, which
was twelve and sixpence.The poor girl had thus about eighteenpence a
month left for her other expenses.But many workwomen, whose position is
less fortunate than hers, since they have neither home nor family, buy a
piece of bread and some other food to keep them through the day; and at
night patronize the "twopenny rope," one with another, in a wretched room
containing five or six beds, some of which are always engaged by men, as
male lodgers are by far the most abundant.Yes; and in spite of the
disgust that a poor and virtuous girl must feel at this arrangement, she
must submit to it; for a lodging-house keeper cannot have separate rooms
for females.To furnish a room, however meanly, the poor workwoman must
possess three or four shillings in ready money.But how save this sum,
out of weekly earnings of a couple of florins, which are scarcely
sufficient to keep her from starving, and are still less sufficient to
clothe her?The poor wretch must resign herself to this repugnant
cohabitation; and so, gradually, the instinct of modesty becomes
weakened; the natural sentiment of chastity, that saved her from the "gay
life," becomes extinct; vice appears to be the only means of improving
her intolerable condition; she yields; and the first "man made of money,"
who can afford a governess for his children, cries out against the
depravity of the lower orders!And yet, painful as the condition of the
working woman is, it is relatively fortunate.Should work fail her for
one day, two days, what then?Should sickness come--sickness almost
always occasioned by unwholesome food, want of fresh air, necessary
attention, and good rest; sickness, often so enervating as to render work
impossible; though not so dangerous as to procure the sufferer a bed in
an hospital--what becomes of the hapless wretches then?The mind
hesitates, and shrinks from dwelling on such gloomy pictures.This inadequacy of wages, one terrible source only of so many evils, and
often of so many vices, is general, especially among women; and, again
this is not private wretchedness, but the wretchedness which afflicts
whole classes, the type of which we endeavor to develop in Mother Bunch.It exhibits the moral and physical condition of thousands of human
creatures in Paris, obliged to subsist on a scanty four shillings a week.This poor workwoman, then, notwithstanding the advantages she unknowingly
enjoyed through Agricola's generosity, lived very miserably; and her
health, already shattered, was now wholly undermined by these constant
hardships.Yet, with extreme delicacy, though ignorant of the little
sacrifice already made for her by Agricola, Mother Bunch pretended she
earned more than she really did, in order to avoid offers of service
which it would have pained her to accept, because she knew the limited
means of Frances and her son, and because it would have wounded her
natural delicacy, rendered still more sensitive by so many sorrows and
humiliations.But, singular as it may appear, this deformed body contained a loving and
generous soul--a mind cultivated even to poetry; and let us add, that
this was owing to the example of Agricola Baudoin, with whom she had been
brought up, and who had naturally the gift.This poor girl was the first
confidant to whom our young mechanic imparted his literary essays; and
when he told her of the charm and extreme relief he found in poetic
reverie, after a day of hard toil, the workwoman, gifted with strong
natural intelligence, felt, in her turn, how great a resource this would
be to her in her lonely and despised condition.One day, to Agricola's great surprise, who had just read some verses to
her, the sewing-girl, with smiles and blushes, timidly communicated to
him also a poetic composition.Her verses wanted rhythm and harmony,
perhaps; but they were simple and affecting, as a non-envenomed complaint
entrusted to a friendly hearer.From that day Agricola and she held
frequent consultations; they gave each other mutual encouragement: but
with this exception, no one else knew anything of the girl's poetical
essays, whose mild timidity made her often pass for a person of weak
intellect.This soul must have been great and beautiful, for in all her
unlettered strains there was not a word of murmuring respecting her hard
lot: her note was sad, but gentle--desponding, but resigned; it was
especially the language of deep tenderness--of mournful sympathy--of
angelic charity for all poor creatures consigned, like her, to bear the
double burden of poverty and deformity.Yet she often expressed a sincere
free-spoken admiration of beauty, free from all envy or bitterness; she
admired beauty as she admired the sun.many were the verses of
hers that Agricola had never seen, and which he was never to see.The young mechanic, though not strictly handsome, had an open masculine
face; was as courageous as kind; possessed a noble, glowing, generous
heart, a superior mind, and a frank, pleasing gayety of spirits.The
young girl, brought up with him, loved him as an unfortunate creature can
love, who, dreading cruel ridicule, is obliged to hide her affection in
the depths of her heart, and adopt reserve and deep dissimulation.She
did not seek to combat her love; to what purpose should she do so?Her well known sisterly affection for Agricola
explained the interest she took in all that concerned him; so that no one
was surprised at the extreme grief of the young workwoman, when, in 1830,
Agricola, after fighting intrepidly for the people's flag, was brought
bleeding home to his mother.Dagobert's son, deceived, like others, on
this point, had never suspected, and was destined never to suspect, this
love for him.Such was the poorly-clad girl who entered the room in which Frances was
preparing her son's supper."Is it you, my poor love," said she; "I have not seen you since morning:
have you been ill?The young girl kissed Agricola's mother, and replied: "I was very busy
about some work, mother; I did not wish to lose a moment; I have only
just finished it.I am going down to fetch some charcoal--do you want
anything while I'm out?""No, no, my child, thank you.It is half-past
eight, and Agricola is not come home."Then she added, after a sigh: "He
kills himself with work for me.Ah, I am very unhappy, my girl; my sight
is quite going.In a quarter of an hour after I begin working, I cannot
see at all--not even to sew sacks.The idea of being a burden to my son
drives me distracted.""Oh, don't, ma'am, if Agricola heard you say that--"

"I know the poor boy thinks of nothing but me, and that augments my
vexation.Only I think that rather than leave me, he gives up the
advantages that his fellow-workmen enjoy at Hardy's, his good and worthy
master--instead of living in this dull garret, where it is scarcely light
at noon, he would enjoy, like the other workmen, at very little expense,
a good light room, warm in winter, airy in summer, with a view of the
garden.not to mention that this place is so
far from his work, that it is quite a toil to him to get to it.""Oh, when he embraces you he forgets his fatigue, Mrs.Baudoin," said
Mother Bunch; "besides, he knows how you cling to the house in which he
was born.M. Hardy offered to settle you at Plessy with Agricola, in the
building put up for the workmen.""Yes, my child; but then I must give up church."But--be easy, I hear him," said the hunchback, blushing.A sonorous, joyous voice was heard singing on the stairs."At least, I'll not let him see that I have been crying," said the good
mother, drying her tears."This is the only moment of rest and ease from
toil he has--I must not make it sad to him."Our blacksmith poet, a tall young man, about four-and-twenty years of
age, was alert and robust, with ruddy complexion, dark hair and eyes, and
aquiline nose, and an open, expressive countenance.His resemblance to
Dagobert was rendered more striking by the thick brown moustache which he
wore according to the fashion; and a sharp-pointed imperial covered his
chin.His cheeks, however, were shaven, Olive color velveteen trousers, a
blue blouse, bronzed by the forge smoke, a black cravat, tied carelessly
round his muscular neck, a cloth cap with a narrow vizor, composed his
dress.The only thing which contrasted singularly with his working
habiliments was a handsome purple flower, with silvery pistils, which he
held in his hand."Good-evening, mother," said he, as he came to kiss Frances immediately.Then, with a friendly nod, he added, "Good-evening, Mother Bunch.""You are very late, my child," said Frances, approaching the little stove
on which her son's simple meal was simmering; "I was getting very
anxious.""Anxious about me, or about my supper, dear mother?"you won't excuse me for keeping the nice little supper
waiting that you get ready for me, for fear it should be spoilt, eh?"So saying, the blacksmith tried to kiss his mother again."Have done, you naughty boy; you'll make me upset the pan.""That would be a pity, mother; for it smells delightfully."I'll swear, now, you have some of the fried potatoes and bacon I'm so
fond of."said Frances, in a tone of mild reproach."True," rejoined Agricola, exchanging a smile of innocent cunning with
Mother Bunch; "but, talking of Saturday, mother, here are my wages.""Thank ye, child; put the money in the cupboard."cried the young sempstress, just as Agricola was about to put
away the money, "what a handsome flower you have in your hand, Agricola."See there, mother," said Agricola, taking the flower to her; "look at
it, admire it, and especially smell it.You can't have a sweeter perfume;
a blending of vanilla and orange blossom.""Indeed, it does smell nice, child.said
Frances, admiringly; "where did you find it?"repeated Agricola, smilingly: "do you think
folks pick up such things between the Barriere du Maine and the Rue
Brise-Miche?"inquired the sewing girl, sharing in Frances's
curiosity.Well, I'll satisfy you, and explain why I
came home so late; for something else detained me.It has been an evening
of adventures, I promise you.I was hurrying home, when I heard a low,
gentle barking at the corner of the Rue de Babylone; it was just about
dusk, and I could see a very pretty little dog, scarce bigger than my
fist, black and tan, with long, silky hair, and ears that covered its
paws.""Lost, poor thing, I warrant," said Frances.I took up the poor thing, and it began to lick my hands.Round its neck was a red satin ribbon, tied in a large bow; but as that
did not bear the master's name, I looked beneath it, and saw a small
collar, made of a gold plate and small gold chains.So I took a Lucifer
match from my 'bacco-box, and striking a light, I read, 'FRISKY belongs
to Hon.Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, No."Why, you were just in the street," said Mother Bunch.Taking the little animal under my arm, I looked about me till I
came to a long garden wall, which seemed to have no end, and found a
small door of a summer-house, belonging no doubt to the large mansion at
the other end of the park; for this garden looked just like a park.So,
looking up I saw 'No.7,' newly painted over a little door with a grated
slide.I rang; and in a few minutes, spent, no doubt, in observing me
through the bars (for I am sure I saw a pair of eyes peeping through),
the gate opened.And now, you'll not believe a word I have to say."said Mother Bunch, as if she was really her namesake of
elfish history.I am quite astounded, even now, at my
adventure; it is like the remembrance of a dream.""Well, let us have it," said the worthy mother, so deeply interested that
she did not perceive her son's supper was beginning to burn."First," said the blacksmith, smiling at the curiosity he had excited, "a
young lady opened the door to me, but so lovely, so beautifully and
gracefully dressed, that you would have taken her for a beautiful
portrait of past times.Before I could say a word, she exclaimed, 'Ah!dear me, sir, you have brought back Frisky; how happy Miss Adrienne will
be!Come, pray come in instantly; she would so regret not having an
opportunity to thank you in person!'And without giving me time to reply,
she beckoned me to follow her.Oh, dear mother, it is quite out of my
power to tell you, the magnificence I saw, as I passed through a small
saloon, partially lighted, and full of perfume!A door opened,--Oh, such a sight!I
was so dazzled I can remember nothing but a great glare of gold and
light, crystal and flowers; and, amidst all this brilliancy, a young lady
of extreme beauty--ideal beauty; but she had red hair, or rather hair
shining like gold!She had black eyes, ruddy lips, and her skin seemed white as
snow.This is all I can recollect: for, as I said before, I was so
dazzled, I seemed to be looking through a veil.'Madame,' said the young
woman, whom I never should have taken for a lady's-maid, she was dressed
so elegantly, 'here is Frisky.This gentleman found him, and brought him
back.''Oh, sir,' said the young lady with the golden hair, in a sweet
silvery voice, 'what thanks I owe you!I am foolishly attached to
Frisky.'Then, no doubt, concluding from my dress that she ought to thank
me in some other way than by words, she took up a silk purse, and said to
me, though I must confess with some hesitation--'No doubt, sir, it gave
you some trouble to bring my pet back.You have, perhaps, lost some
valuable time--allow me--' She held forth her purse.""Oh, Agricola," said Mother Bunch, sadly; "how people may be deceived!""Hear the end, and you will perhaps forgive the young lady.Seeing by my
looks that the offer of the purse hurt me, she took a magnificent
porcelain vase that contained this flower, and, addressing me in a tone
full of grace and kindness, that left me room to guess that she was vexed
at having wounded me, she said--'At least, sir, you will accept this
flower.'""You are right, Agricola," said the girl, smiling sadly; "an involuntary
error could not be repaired in a nicer way."Worthy young lady," said Frances, wiping her eyes; "how well she
understood my Agricola!"But just as I was taking the flower, without daring
to raise my eyes (for, notwithstanding the young lady's kind manner,
there was something very imposing about her) another handsome girl, tall
and dark, and dressed to the top of fashion, came in and said to the
red-haired young lady, 'He is here, Madame.'She immediately rose and
said to me, 'A thousand pardons, sir.I shall never forget that I am
indebted to you for a moment of much pleasure.Pray remember, on all
occasions, my address and name--Adrienne de Cardoville.'I could not find a word to say in reply.The same young
woman showed me to the door, and curtseyed to me very politely.And there
I stood in the Rue de Babylone, as dazzled and astonished as if I had
come out of an enchanted palace.""Indeed, my child, it is like a fairy tale."Yes, ma'am," said Mother Bunch, in an absent manner that Agricola did
not observe."What affected me most," rejoined Agricola, "was, that the young lady, on
seeing her little dog, did not forget me for it, as many would have done
in her place, and took no notice of it before me.That shows delicacy and
feeling, does it not?Indeed, I believe this young lady to be so kind and
generous, that I should not hesitate to have recourse to her in any
important case.""Yes, you are right," replied the sempstress, more and more absent.She felt no jealousy, no hatred,
towards this young stranger, who, from her beauty, wealth, and delicacy,
seemed to belong to a sphere too splendid and elevated to be even within
the reach of a work, girl's vision; but, making an involuntary comparison
of this fortunate condition with her own, the poor thing had never felt
more cruelly her deformity and poverty.Yet such were the humility and
gentle resignation of this noble creature, that the only thing which made
her feel ill-disposed towards Adrienne de Cardoville was the offer of the
purse to Agricola; but then the charming way in which the young lady had
atoned for her error, affected the sempstress deeply.She could not restrain her tears as she contemplated the
magnificent flower--so rich in color and perfume, which, given by a
charming hand, was doubtless very precious to Agricola."Now, mother," resumed the young man smilingly, and unaware of the
painful emotion of the other bystander, "you have had the cream of my
adventures first.I have told you one of the causes of my delay; and now
for the other.Just now, as I was coming in, I met the dyer at the foot
of the stairs, his arms a beautiful pea-green.Stopping me he said, with
an air full of importance, that he thought he had seen a chap sneaking
about the house like a spy, 'Well, what is that to you, Daddy Loriot?'said I: 'are you afraid he will nose out the way to make the beautiful
green, with which you are dyed up to the very elbows?'""But who could that man be, Agricola?""On my word, mother, I don't know and scarcely care; I tried to persuade
Daddy Loriot, who chatters like a magpie, to return to his cellar, since
it could signify as little to him as to me, whether a spy watched him or
not."So saying, Agricola went and placed the little leathern sack,
containing his wages, on a shelf, in the cupboard.As Frances put down the saucepan on the end of the table, Mother Bunch,
recovering from her reverie, filled a basin with water, and, taking it to
the blacksmith, said to him in a gentle tone-"Agricola--for your hands."Then with a most unaffected
gesture and tone, he added, "There is my fine flower for your trouble."cried the sempstress, with emotion, while a vivid
blush  her pale and interesting face."Do you give me this
handsome flower, which a lovely rich young lady so kindly and graciously
gave you?"And the poor thing repeated, with growing astonishment, "Do
you give it to me?""What the deuce should I do with it?Wear it on my heart, have it set as
a pin?""It is true I was very much impressed by
the charming way in which the young lady thanked me.I am delighted to
think I found her little dog, and very happy to be able to give you this
flower, since it pleases you.You see the day has been a happy one."While Mother Bunch, trembling with pleasure, emotion, and surprise, took
the flower, the young blacksmith washed his hands, so black with smoke
and steel filings that the water became dark in an instant.Agricola,
pointing out this change to the sempstress, said to her in a whisper,
laughing,-"Here's cheap ink for us paper-stainers!I finished some verses
yesterday, which I am rather satisfied with.With this, Agricola wiped his hands naturally on the front of his blouse,
while Mother Bunch replaced the basin on the chest of drawers, and laid
the flower against the side of it."Can't you ask for a towel," said Frances, shrugging her shoulders,
"instead of wiping your hands on your blouse?""After being scorched all day long at the forge, it will be all the
better for a little cooling to-night, won't it?Scold me, then, if you dare!Frances made no reply; but, placing her hands on either side of her son's
head, so beautiful in its candor, resolution and intelligence, she
surveyed him for a moment with maternal pride, and kissed him repeatedly
on the forehead."Come," said she, "sit down: you stand all day at your forge, and it is
late.""So,--your arm-chair again!"said Agricola.--"Our usual quarrel every
evening--take it away, I shall be quite as much at ease on another."You ought at least to rest after your hard toil.""Well, I preach like a
good apostle; but I am quite at ease in your arm-chair, after all.Since
I sat down on the throne in the Tuileries, I have never had a better
seat."Frances Baudoin, standing on one side of the table, cut a slice of bread
for her son, while Mother Bunch, on the other, filled his silver mug.There was something affecting in the attentive eagerness of the two
excellent creatures, for him whom they loved so tenderly."Thank you, Agricola," replied the sempstress, looking down, "I have only
just dined.""Oh, I only ask you for form's sake--you have your whims--we can never
prevail on you to eat with us--just like mother; she prefers dining all
alone; and in that way she deprives herself without my knowing it."It is better for my health to dine early.Oh, I am very fond of
stockfish; I should have been born a Newfoundland fisherman."This worthy lad, on the contrary, was but poorly refreshed, after a hard
day's toil, with this paltry stew,--a little burnt as it had been, too,
during his story; but he knew he pleased his mother by observing the fast
without complaining.He affected to enjoy his meal; and the good woman
accordingly observed with satisfaction:

"Oh, I see you like it, my dear boy; Friday and Saturday next we'll have
some more.""Thank you, mother,--only not two days together.One gets tired of
luxuries, you know!And now, let us talk of what we shall do
to-morrow--Sunday.We must be very merry, for the last few days you seem
very sad, dear mother, and I can't make it out--I fancy you are not
satisfied with me.""Oh, my dear child!--you--the pattern of--"

"Well, well!Prove to me that you are happy, then, by taking a little
amusement.Perhaps you will do us the honor of accompanying us, as you
did last time," added Agricola, bowing to Mother Bunch.The latter blushed and looked down; her face assumed an expression of
bitter grief, and she made no reply."I have the prayers to attend all day, you know, my dear child," said
Frances to her son.I don't propose the theatre; but they say
there is a conjurer to be seen whose tricks are very amusing."I am obliged to you, my son; but that is a kind of theatre.""My dear child, do I ever hinder others from doing what they like?"Well, then, if it should be fine, we will
simply take a walk with Mother Bunch on the Boulevards.It is nearly
three months since she went out with us; and she never goes out without
us.""No, no; go alone, my child."You know very well, Agricola," said the sempstress, blushing up to the
eyes, "that I ought not to go out with you and your mother again."May I ask, without impropriety, the cause of this
refusal?"The poor girl smiled sadly, and replied, "Because I will not expose you
to a quarrel on my account, Agricola.""Forgive me," said Agricola, in a tone of sincere grief, and he struck
his forehead vexedly.To this Mother Bunch alluded sometimes, but very rarely, for she observed
punctilious discretion.The girl had gone out with Agricola and his
mother.Such occasions were, indeed, holidays for her.Many days and
nights had she toiled hard to procure a decent bonnet and shawl, that she
might not do discredit to her friends.The five or six days of holidays,
thus spent arm in arm with him whom she adored in secret, formed the sum
of her happy days.Taking their last walk, a coarse, vulgar man elbowed her so rudely that
the poor girl could not refrain from a cry of terror, and the man
retorted it by saying,-"What are you rolling your hump in my way for,
stoopid?"Agricola, like his father, had the patience which force and courage give
to the truly brave; but he was extremely quick when it became necessary
to avenge an insult.Irritated at the vulgarity of this man, Agricola
left his mother's arm to inflict on the brute, who was of his own age,
size, and force, two vigorous blows, such as the powerful arm and huge
fist of a blacksmith never before inflicted on human face.The villain
attempted to return it, and Agricola repeated the correction, to the
amusement of the crowd, and the fellow slunk away amidst a deluge of
hisses.This adventure made Mother Bunch say she would not go out with
Agricola again, in order to save him any occasion of quarrel.We may
conceive the blacksmith's regret at having thus unwittingly revived the
memory of this circumstance,--more painful, alas!for Mother Bunch than
Agricola could imagine, for she loved him passionately, and her infirmity
had been the cause of that quarrel.Notwithstanding his strength and
resolution, Agricola was childishly sensitive; and, thinking how painful
that thought must be to the poor girl, a large tear filled his eyes, and,
holding out his hands, he said, in a brotherly tone, "Forgive my
heedlessness!And he gave her thin, pale cheeks two
hearty kisses.The poor girl's lips turned pale at this cordial caress; and her heart
beat so violently that she was obliged to lean against the corner of the
table."Come, you forgive me, do you not?"she said, trying to subdue her emotion; "but the recollection
of that quarrel pains me--I was so alarmed on your account; if the crowd
had sided with that man!"said Frances, coming to the sewing-girl's relief, without knowing
it, "I was never so afraid in all my life!""Oh, mother," rejoined Agricola, trying to change a conversation which
had now become disagreeable for the sempstress, "for the wife of a horse
grenadier of the Imperial Guard, you have not much courage.Oh, my brave
father; I can't believe he is really coming!The very thought turns me
topsy-turvy!""Heaven grant he may come," said Frances, with a sigh.Lord knows, you
have had masses enough said for his return.""Agricola, my child," said Frances, interrupting her son, and shaking her
head sadly, "do not speak in that way.Besides, you are talking of your
father.""Well, I'm in for it this evening.'Tis your turn now; positively, I am
growing stupid, or going crazy.That's the
only word I can get out to-night.You know that, when I do let out on
certain subjects, it is because I can't help it; for I know well the pain
it gives you.""You do not offend me, my poor, dear, misguided boy.""It comes to the same thing; and there is nothing so bad as to offend
one's mother; and, with respect to what I said about father's return, I
do not see that we have any cause to doubt it.""But we have not heard from him for four months.""You know, mother, in his letter--that is, in the letter which he
dictated (for you remember that, with the candor of an old soldier, he
told us that, if he could read tolerably well, he could not write); well,
in that letter he said we were not to be anxious about him; that he
expected to be in Paris about the end of January, and would send us word,
three or four days before, by what road he expected to arrive, that I
might go and meet him.""True, my child; and February is come, and no news yet.""The greater reason why we should wait patiently.But I'll tell you more:
I should not be surprised if our good Gabriel were to come back about the
same time.His last letter from America makes me hope so.What pleasure,
mother, should all the family be together!""And that day will soon come, trust me.""Do you remember your father, Agricola?""To tell the truth, I remember most his great grenadier's shako and
moustache, which used to frighten me so, that nothing but the red ribbon
of his cross of honor, on the white facings of his uniform, and the
shining handle of his sabre, could pacify me; could it, mother?What he must suffer at being separated from us at
his age--sixty and past!my child, my heart breaks, when I think
that he comes home only to change one kind of poverty for another."Isn't there a room here for you and for him;
and a table for you too?Only, my good mother, since we are talking of
domestic affairs," added the blacksmith, imparting increased tenderness
to his tone, that he might not shock his mother, "when he and Gabriel
come home, you won't want to have any more masses said, and tapers burned
for them, will you?Well, that saving will enable father to have tobacco
to smoke, and his bottle of wine every day.Then, on Sundays, we will
take a nice dinner at the eating-house."Instead of doing so, some one half-opened the door,
and, thrusting in an arm of a pea-green color, made signs to the
blacksmith."'Tis old Loriot, the pattern of dyers," said Agricola; "come in, Daddy,
no ceremony.""Impossible, my lad; I am dripping with dye from head to foot; I should
cover missus's floor with green."It will remind me of the fields I like so much.""Without joking, Agricola, I must speak to you immediately."Oh, be easy; what's he to us?""No; I think he's gone; at any rate, the fog is so thick I can't see him.But that's not it--come, come quickly!It is very important," said the
dyer, with a mysterious look; "and only concerns you.""Go and see, my child," said Frances."Yes, mother; but the deuce take me if I can make it out."And the blacksmith left the room, leaving his mother with Mother Bunch.In five minutes Agricola returned; his face was pale and agitated--his
eyes glistened with tears, and his hands trembled; but his countenance
expressed extraordinary happiness and emotion.He stood at the door for a
moment, as if too much affected to accost his mother.Frances's sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the
change her son's countenance had undergone."Well, my child--what is it?"Before the blacksmith could reply, Mother Bunch, who had more
discernment, exclaimed: "Goodness, Agricola--how pale you are!"Mother," said the artisan, hastening to Frances, without replying to the
sempstress,--"mother, expect news that will astonish you; but promise me
you will be calm."Mother Bunch was
right--you are quite pale."and Agricola, kneeling before Frances, took both her
hands in his--"you must--you do not know,--but--"

The blacksmith could not go on.'What is the matter?--you
terrify me!""Oh, no, I would not terrify you; on the contrary," said Agricola, drying
his eyes--"you will be so happy.But, again, you must try and command
your feelings, for too much joy is as hurtful as too much grief.""Did I not say true, when I said he would come?"She rose from her seat; but her surprise and
emotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to still its
beating, and then she felt her strength fail.Her son sustained her, and
assisted her to sit down.Mother Bunch, till now, had stood discreetly apart, witnessing from a
distance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother.But she now drew near timidly, thinking she might be useful; for Frances
changed color more and more."Come, courage, mother," said the blacksmith; "now the shock is over, you
have only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father."Oh, I cannot believe it,"
said Frances, bursting into tears."So true, that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can, I will
tell you when you may see him.""He may arrive any minute--to-morrow--perhaps to-day."Well, I must tell you all--he has arrived.""He--he is--" Frances could not articulate the word.Before coming up, he sent the dyer to
apprise me that I might prepare you; for my brave father feared the
surprise might hurt you.""And now," cried the blacksmith, in an accent of indescribable joy--"he
is there, waiting!for the last ten minutes I have scarcely
been able to contain myself--my heart is bursting with joy."And running
to the door, he threw it open.Dagobert, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, stood on the threshold.Instead of rushing to her husband's arms, Frances fell on her knees in
prayer.She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her
prayers, and thus accepting her offerings.During a second, the actors of
this scene stood silent and motionless.Agricola, by a sentiment of
respect and delicacy, which struggled violently with his affection, did
not dare to fall on his father's neck.He waited with constrained
impatience till his mother had finished her prayer.The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith; they
understood each other.The first glance exchanged by father and son
expressed their affection--their veneration for that excellent woman, who
in the fulness of her religious fervor, forgot, perhaps, too much the
creature for the Creator.Rose and Blanche, confused and affected, looked with interest on the
kneeling woman; while Mother Bunch, shedding in silence tears of joy at
the thought of Agricola's happiness, withdrew into the most obscure
corner of the room, feeling that she was a stranger, and necessarily out
of place in that family meeting.Frances rose, and took a step towards
her husband, who received her in his arms.There was a moment of solemn
silence.Dagobert and Frances said not a word.Nothing could be heard but
a few sighs, mingled with sighs of joy.And, when the aged couple looked
up, their expression was calm, radiant, serene; for the full and complete
enjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a feverish
and violent agitation."My children," said the soldier, in tones of emotion, presenting the
orphans to Frances, who, after her first agitation, had surveyed them
with astonishment, "this is my good and worthy wife; she will be to the
daughters of General Simon what I have been to them.""Then, madame, you will treat us as your children," said Rose,
approaching Frances with her sister.cried Dagobert's wife, more and more
astonished."Yes, my dear Frances; I have brought them from afar not without some
difficulty; but I will tell you that by and by."One would take them for two angels, exactly alike!"said Frances, contemplating the orphans with as much interest as
admiration."Now--for us," cried Dagobert, turning to his son.We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert and
his son, and the crushing grip of their hands, which Dagobert interrupted
only to look in Agricola's face; while he rested his hands on the young
blacksmith's broad shoulders that he might see to more advantage his
frank masculine countenance, and robust frame.Then he shook his hand
again, exclaiming, "He's a fine fellow--well built--what a good-hearted
look he has!"From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricola's happiness; but
she feared that her presence, till then unheeded, would be an intrusion.She wished to withdraw unnoticed, but could not do so.Dagobert and his
son were between her and the door; and she stood unable to take her eyes
from the charming faces of Rose and Blanche.She had never seen anything
so winsome; and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters increased
her surprise.Then, their humble mourning revealing that they were poor,
Mother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them.They are cold; their little hands are frozen, and,
unfortunately, the fire is out," said Frances, She tried to warm the
orphans' hands in hers, while Dagobert and his son gave themselves up to
the feelings of affection, so long restrained.As soon as Frances said that the fire was out, Mother Bunch hastened to
make herself useful, as an excuse for her presence; and, going to the
cupboard, where the charcoal and wood were kept, she took some small
pieces, and, kneeling before the stove, succeeded, by the aid of a few
embers that remained, in relighting the fire, which soon began to draw
and blaze.Filling a coffee-pot with water, she placed it on the stove,
presuming that the orphans required some warm drink.The sempstress did
all this with so much dexterity and so little noise--she was naturally so
forgotten amidst the emotions of the scene--that Frances, entirely
occupied with Rose and Blanche, only perceived the fire when she felt its
warmth diffusing round, and heard the boiling water singing in the
coffee-pot.This phenomenon--fire rekindling of itself--did not astonish
Dagobert's wife then, so wholly was she taken up in devising how she
could lodge the maidens; for Dagobert as we have seen, had not given her
notice of their arrival.Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door.there's Spoil-sport," said Dagobert, letting in his dog; "he
wants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family too."The dog came in with a bound, and in a second was quite at home.After
having rubbed Dagobert's hand with his muzzle, he went in turns to greet
Rose and Blanche, and also Frances and Agricola; but seeing that they
took but little notice of him, he perceived Mother Bunch, who stood
apart, in an obscure corner of the room, and carrying out the popular
saying, "the friends of our friends are our friends," he went and licked
the hands of the young workwoman, who was just then forgotten by all.By
a singular impulse, this action affected the girl to tears; she patted
her long, thin, white hand several times on the head of the intelligent
dog.Then, finding that she could be no longer useful (for she had done
all the little services she deemed in her power), she took the handsome
flower Agricola had given her, opened the door gently, and went away so
discreetly that no one noticed her departure.After this exchange of
mutual affection, Dagobert, his wife, and son, began to think of the
realities of life."Poor Frances," said the soldier, glancing at Rose and Blanche, "you did
not expect such a pretty surprise!""I am only sorry, my friend," replied Frances, "that the daughters of
General Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor room; for
with Agricola's garret--"

"It composes our mansion," interrupted Dagobert; "there are handsomer, it
must be confessed.But be at ease; these young ladies are drilled into
not being hard to suit on that score.To-morrow, I and my boy will go arm
and arm, and I'll answer for it he won't walk the more upright and
straight of the two, and find out General Simon's father, at M. Hardy's
factory, to talk about business.""To-morrow," said Agricola to Dagobert, "you will not find at the factory
either M. Hardy or Marshall Simon's father.""What is that you say, my lad?"cried Dagobert, hastily, "the Marshal!""To be sure; since 1830, General Simon's friends have secured him the
title and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny."cried Dagobert, with emotion, "but that ought not to surprise
me; for, after all, it is just; and when the emperor said a thing, the
least they can do is to let it abide.But it goes all the same to my
heart; it makes me jump again."Addressing the sisters, he said: "Do you hear that, my children?You
arrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France.One would
hardly think it, indeed, to see you in this room, my poor little
duchesses!Ah, father Simon must have
been very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank!"He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see his
son again; for it was during the general's absence that his friends
obtained this act of justice.But they expect Marshal Simon every moment,
for the last letter from India announced his departure."At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other; and their eyes
filled with tears.These children rely on his return; but why shall we
not find M. Hardy and father Simon at the factory to-morrow?""Ten days ago, they went to examine and study an English mill established
in the south; but we expect them back every day."that's vexing; I relied on seeing the general's father, to
talk over some important matters with him.At any rate, they know where
to write to him.So to-morrow you will let him know, my lad, that his
granddaughters are arrived.In the mean time, children," added the
soldier, to Rose and Blanche, "my good wife will give you her bed and you
must put up with the chances of war.they will not be worse
off here than they were on the journey.""You know we shall always be well off with you and madame," said Rose."Besides, we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris,
since here we are to find our father," added Blanche."That hope gives you patience, I know," said Dagobert, "but no matter!After all you have heard about it, you ought to be finely surprised, my
children.As yet, you have not found it the golden city of your dreams,
by any means.But, patience, patience; you'll find Paris not so bad as it
looks.""Besides," said Agricola, "I am sure the arrival of Marshal Simon in
Paris will change it for you into a golden city.""You are right, Agricola," said Rose, with a smile, "you have, indeed,
guessed us.""Certainly, Agricola, we often talked about you with Dagobert; and
latterly, too, with Gabriel," added Blanche.cried Agricola and his mother, at the same time."Yes," replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the orphans,
"we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and among other
things, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel.All I can now say is that,
in his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired of
saying'my boy'); and they ought to love each other like brothers.Oh, my
brave, brave wife!"said Dagobert, with emotion, "you did a good thing,
poor as you were, taking the unfortunate child--and bringing him up with
your own.""Don't talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple thing.""You are right; but I'll make you amends for it by and by.'Tis down to
your account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see him to-morrow
morning."cried the blacksmith; "who'll say, after
this, that there are not days set apart for happiness?How came you to
meet him, father?""I'll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met Gabriel; for if
you expect to sleep, you are mistaken.You'll give me half your room, and
a fine chat we'll have.Spoil-sport will stay outside of this door; he is
accustomed to sleep at the children's door.""Dear me, love, I think of nothing.But, at such a moment, if you and the
young ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the
cook-shop.""No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.""You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to warm
you a little, my dear young ladies," said Frances; "unfortunately, I have
nothing else to offer you.""You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go to
bed; while they do so, I'll go to my boy's room, and, before Rose and
Blanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you, just to give
Agricola a respite.""It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her," said Agricola."But I think she was here when my husband came in," added Frances."Right, mother; and the good girl left lest she should be an intruder:
she is so thoughtful.But no--no--it is not she who knocks so loud.""Go and see who it is, then, Agricola."Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with
a respectable air, entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking
for a moment at Rose and Blanche."Allow me to observe, sir," said Agricola, "that after knocking, you
might have waited till the door was opened, before you entered."Pray excuse me, sir," said the man, very politely, and speaking slowly,
perhaps to prolong his stay in the room: "I beg a thousand pardons--I
regret my intrusion--I am ashamed--"

"Well, you ought to be, sir," said Agricola, with impatience, "what do
you want?""Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live here?""No, sir; upstairs," said Agricola."Really, sir," cried the polite man, with low bows, "I am quite abroad at
my blunder: I thought this was the room of that young person.I brought
her proposals for work from a very respectable party.""It is very late, sir," said Agricola, with surprise."But that young
person is as one of our family.Call to-morrow; you cannot see her to
night; she is gone to bed.""Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse--"

"Enough, sir," said Agricola, taking a step towards the door."I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be
assured that--"

"If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to excuse
the length of your excuses; and it is time this came to an end!"Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed
his moustache with pride."But that does not
astonish you--you are used to it."During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again
directed a long inquiring glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and
Dagobert.In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground
for herself, and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans,
assisted them to undress with maternal solicitude, Dagobert and Agricola
having previously withdrawn to their garret.Just as the blacksmith, who
preceded his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother
Bunch's room, the latter, half concealed in the shade, said to him
rapidly, in a low tone:

"Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you."These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did
not hear them; but as Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old
soldier said to him,

"Well, boy, what is it?""Nothing, father," said the blacksmith, turning round; "I feared I did
not light you well.""Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to
night;" and the soldier, not noticing his son's surprise, went into the
little room where they were both to pass the night.On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over
polite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of Brise-Miche Street.He advanced
towards a hackney-coach drawn up on the Cloitre Saint-Merry Square.In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak."The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances
Baudoin's; by listening at the door, I learnt that the sisters will sleep
with her, in that room, to-night; the old man with gray moustache will
share the young blacksmith's room.""I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening on
the subject of the Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to
learn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by the
post about the young blacksmith."And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin's
confessor, late as it is; you will tell him that I am waiting for him at
Rue du Milieu des Ursins--he must not lose a moment.Should I not be returned, he will wait for me.You will tell him it
is on a matter of great moment.""All shall be faithfully executed," said the ceremonious man, cringing to
Rodin, as the coach drove quickly away.AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH.Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described
the most profound silence reigned in the soldier's humble dwelling.A
flickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,
betrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy
recess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except
by this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with
the roof.A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so
nearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be
seated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl
was carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a
linen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple
calix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were
feebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle.The sempstress, who
had taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks
were downcast, and her eyes full of tears.She supported herself with one
hand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door, listened
with painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the footsteps of
Agricola.The heart of the young sempstress beat violently; her face,
usually very pale, was now partially flushed--so exciting was the emotion
by which she was agitated.Sometimes she cast her eyes with terror upon a
letter which she held in her hand, a letter that had been delivered by
post in the course of the evening, and which had been placed by the
housekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was rendering some
trivial domestic services during the recognitions of Dagobert and his
family.After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly
opened."I waited till my father went to sleep," said the blacksmith, in a low
voice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness."But
what is the matter, my good sister?said she, her voice trembling with emotion, while she
hastily presented to him the open letter.Agricola held it towards the
light, and read what follows:

"A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the
sisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you.That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of
to-morrow."exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air of stupefied
amazement.quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands.Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his
eyes:-"The song, entitled 'Working-men Freed,' has been declared
libellous.Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a
secret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as
being concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy."said the girl, melting into tears, "now I see it all.The man who
was lurking about below, this evening, who was observed by the dyer, was,
doubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home."My verses
breathe nothing but philanthropy.Am I to blame, if they have been found
among the papers of a secret society?"Agricola disdainfully threw the
letter upon the table."If you wish it," said Agricola, "I will; no time is lost."He resumed the reading of the letter:

"A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin.There is mo
doubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be
well if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in
order that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to
trial--an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,
whose sole support he is."A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown."After a moment's silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his countenance
resumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: "Reassure yourself, good
Mother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying their games on
me.It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me before the
time.""Agricola, for the love of heaven!"said the girl, in a supplicating
tone; "treat not the warning thus lightly.Believe in my forebodings, and
listen to my advice.""I tell you again, my good girl," replied Agricola, "that it is two
months since my song was published.It is not in any way political;
indeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before coming
down on me.""But," said the other, "you forget that new events have arisen.It is
scarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in this very
neighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires.And," continued she, "if the
verses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now been found in the
possession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy, nothing more
is necessary to compromise you in the plot."in which I only praise the
love of labor and of goodness!If so, justice
would be but a blind noodle.That she might grope her way, it would be
necessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim's staff to guide her
steps.""Agricola," resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on
hearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, "I conjure you to listen to
me!No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor; but you
do also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor
laborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries of life;
you recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men; but your good and noble
heart vents its indignation, at the same time, against the selfish and
the wicked.In fine, you fervently hasten on, with the ardor of your
wishes, the emancipation of all the artisans who, less fortunate than
you, have not generous M. Hardy for employer.Say, Agricola, in these
times of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than
that numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the
persons who have been apprehended?"Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an
excellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view
with more seriousness the advice which she had given him.Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say: "And
then, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.""Yes," resumed the sempstress; "a letter of his, a letter in itself quite
insignificant, was found in the house of a person arrested last year for
conspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a month in prison.""That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily shown, and
he was set at liberty.""Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that has
furnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself!These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola.He took up the
letter and again read it attentively."And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?""I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot be
naturally accounted for.what a blow it would be for your father,
and poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything.consider, then, what would become of them
without you--without your labor!""It would indeed be terrible," said Agricola, impatiently casting the
letter upon the table."What you have said concerning Remi is too true.He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an involuntary error
though it be, is not the less cruel.But they don't commit a man without
hearing him.""But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards," said Mother Bunch,
bitterly; "and then, after a month or two, they restore him his liberty.And if he have a wife and children, whose only means of living is his
daily labor, what becomes of them while their only supporter is in
prison?They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they weep!"At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled."A month without work," he said, with a sad and thoughtful air."And my
mother, and father, and the two young ladies who make part of our family
until the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal Simon.That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!"exclaimed the girl impetuously; "suppose you apply to M.
Hardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed and honored,
that, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up their
persecution?""Unfortunately," replied Agricola, "M. Hardy is absent; he is on a
journey with Marshal Simon."After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,
added: "But no!After all, I had
rather await what may come.I'll at least have the chance of proving my
innocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister, whether it
be that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my working for my
family will be equally prevented."that is true," said the poor girl; "what is to be done!"My brave father," said Agricola to himself, "if this misfortune happen
to-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who came here to sleep
so joyously!"The blacksmith buried his face in his hands.Unhappily Mother Bunch's fears were too well-founded, for it will be
recollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue
des Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made
among the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against
democratical ideas.Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some
seconds.A blush  her features, which bore the impressions of an
indefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope."The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower" (she
showed it to the blacksmith) "who has known how to make reparation with
so much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot but have a
generous heart.You must apply to her--"

With these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort
over herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks.For the first time in
her life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy.Another woman
was so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she
idolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched."But what could be done
with this young lady?""Did she not say to you," answered Mother Bunch, "'Remember my name; and
in all circumstances address yourself to me?'""This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful
connections who will be able to protect and defend you.Go to her to
morrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her
support.""But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?"I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he had
saved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety for
him.It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your
innocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you
will have nothing more to fear."said Agricola, "to ask so great a service from a person
to whom one is almost unknown is hard.""Believe me, Agricola," said the other sadly, "I would never counsel what
could possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and above all--do you
understand?--above all, in the eyes of this young lady.I do not propose
that you should ask money from her; but only that she should give surety
for you, in order that you may have the liberty of continuing at your
employment, so that the family may not be without resources.Believe me,
Agricola, that such a request is in no respect inconsistent with what is
noble and becoming upon your part.The heart of the young lady is
generous.The required surety will be
as nothing to her; while to you it will be everything, and will even be
the very life to those who depend upon you.""You are right, my good sister," said Agricola, with sadness and
dejection."It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step.If the
young lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety will
indeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event.added he, rising, "I'd never dare to make the request to her!What is the insignificant service that I
rendered her, when compared with that which I should solicit from her?""Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the
services which ought to be rendered, by those previously received?Trust
to me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart.I am, it is
true, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any
other person.I am nothing, and I can do nothing.Nevertheless, I am
sure--yes, Agricola, I am sure--that this young lady, who is so very far
above me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair;
yes, like me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel
one; and she will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that
which I would do, if, alas!I could do anything more than uselessly
consume myself with regrets."In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so
heart-breaking--there was something so moving in the comparison which
this unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,
made of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent
youth, beauty, and opulence--that Agricola was moved even to tears; and,
holding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her, tenderly,
"How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good feeling, and
delicacy!""Unhappily," said the weeping girl, "I can do nothing more than advise.""And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear.They are those
of a soul the most elevated I have ever known.Yes, you have won me over
into making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss de
Cardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!"At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne,
the sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely
sweet and consoling were her emotions.If some poor creatures, fatally
devoted to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught,
they sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the
world is equally ignorant.The least word of true tenderness and
affection, which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably
blissful for these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to
hardships and to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of
themselves."Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young
lady's house?"exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a new-born hope."And," she quickly added, "at break of day I'll go down to watch at the
street-door, to see if there be anything suspicious, and to apprise you
of what I perceive.""It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of your
father," said the hunchback."The quarter in which the young lady dwells,
is so deserted, that the mere going there will almost serve for your
present concealment.""I think I hear the voice of my father," said Agricola suddenly.In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola's garret, that he and
the sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:

"Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy?Why, my first sleep is
over; and my tongue itches deucedly."said Mother Bunch; "your absence would disquiet
him.On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I inform you whether
or not I shall have seen anything suspicious.""Why, Agricola, you are not here?"resumed Dagobert, in a louder voice."Here I am, father," said the smith, while going out of the sempstress's
apartment, and entering the garret, to his father."I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated, lest
its noise should disturb you.""Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me," said Dagobert,
gayly; "it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with you.Oh, my
dear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father, who has not
seen his son for eighteen years.""Shall I light a candle, father?""No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark.It will be a
new pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak.It will be
like seeing you for the first time twice."The door of Agricola's garret
being now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more.The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed
not an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in
order that she might watch over the safety of Agricola.However, in spite
of her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to
sink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy.She compared the
conversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom
she secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she
possessed some share of charms and beauty--had she been loved as she
loved, with a chaste and devoted flame!But soon sinking into belief that
she should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found
consolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola.At the dawn of day,
she rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order
to see if anything menaced Agricola from without.The weather, damp and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear
and cold towards morning.Through the glazed skylight of Agricola's
garret, where he lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be
seen.The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the
sewing-girl's.For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which
Agricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a
nail in the wall a portrait of Beranger--that immortal poet whom the
people revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has
delighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their
reverses.Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had
already risen.The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his
inquietude, for renewed reflection had again increased his fears.The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number
of precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of
Agricola's song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the
disconcerted plot, was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the
young blacksmith.His father, however, as we have already mentioned,
suspected not his secret anguish.Seated by the side of his son, upon the
edge of their mean little bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had
dressed and shaved with military care; he now held between his hands both
those of Agricola, his countenance radiant with joy, and unable to
discontinue the contemplation of his boy."You will laugh at me, my dear boy," said Dagobert to his son; "but I
wished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze upon you in
full day, as I now see you.But all in good time; I have lost nothing.Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear
moustaches.What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made!Tell me;
have you never had a wish to be a soldier?""That's right," said Dagobert: "and besides, I believe, after all, look
ye, that the time of the sword has gone by.We old fellows are now good
for nothing, but to be put in a corner of the chimney.Like rusty old
carbines, we have had our day.""Yes; your days of heroism and of glory," said Agricola with excitement;
and then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and agitated, "it is
something good and cheering to be your son!""As to the good, I know nothing of that," replied Dagobert; "but as for
the cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly.And I think this
is but the beginning!I am like the famished
wretches who have been some days without food.It is but by little and
little that they recover themselves, and can eat.Now, you may expect to
be tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the day.No,
I wish not to think that--not all the day--no, that thought dazzles and
perplexes me; and I am no longer myself."These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola.He believed
that they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was
menaced."Well," continued Dagobert; "you are quite happy; M. Hardy is always good
to you."replied Agricola: "there is none in the world better, or more
equitable and generous!If you knew what wonders he has brought about in
his factory!Compared to all others, it is a paradise beside the stithies
of Lucifer!""You shall see," resumed Agricola, "what welfare, what joy, what
affection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs;
who work with an ardent pleasure."This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician," said Dagobert."He is, father, a very great magician.He has known how to render labor
pleasant and attractive.As for the pleasure, over and above good wages,
he accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;
whence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work.And that
is not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in
which all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful
and salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an
association.But you shall see--I repeat--you shall see!""They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,"
observed Dagobert."Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor good
mother!""No, father, we will never separate again," said Agricola, stifling a
sigh."My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you have
suffered."exclaimed Dagobert, "who the deuce has suffered?Look me well
in the face; and see if I have a look of suffering!Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a young man again!You
shall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out!I wager that in
beholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will say, behold
father and son!But let us settle what we are to do with the day.You
will write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his
grand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should
hasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which
are of great importance for them.While you are writing, I will go down
to say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones.Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes
to be regular at that: the good soul!and
during her absence, we will make a raid together.""Father," said Agricola, with embarrassment, "this morning it is out of
my power to accompany you."said Dagobert; "recollect this is Monday!""Yes, father," said Agricola, hesitatingly; "but I have promised to
attend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that is required
in a hurry.If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury upon M.
Hardy."That alters the case," said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret."I thought
to make my first parade through Paris with you this morning; but it must
be deferred in favor of your work.It is sacred: since it is that which
sustains your mother.Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious.See how quickly one gets habituated to and
spoilt by happiness.I growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put
off for a few hours!I who, during eighteen years, have only
hoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon it!Vive l'amour et cogni--I mean--my
Agricola!"And, to console himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his
son's shoulder.This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one
moment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized."Now
that I have recovered myself," said Dagobert, laughing, "let us speak of
business.Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries in
Paris?""I don't know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.""My reason is," resumed Dagobert, "that I sent from Russia by post, and
by order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here, some
important papers to a Parisian notary.As it was my duty to see this
notary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his
address in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my
journey; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me,
that if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might recollect
it."Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start.He
involuntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension.His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had
not perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: "Come in!"He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed
hat.To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,
were two movements performed at once by Agricola--as quick as
thought.--"My brother!"Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,
while they were locked in a close embrace.Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes
become moist.There was something truly touching in the affection of the
young men--in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and
aspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola
contrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel."I was forewarned by my father of your arrival," said the blacksmith at
length."I have been expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a
hundred times the greater, because I have had all the pleasures of hoping
for it."asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands
of Dagobert."I trust that you have found her in good health."replied Dagobert; "and her health will have become a
hundred times better, now that we are all together.Then addressing himself to Agricola, who, forgetting
his fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of
ineffable affection, Dagobert added:

"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel
has the courage of a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he
saved the lives of Marshal Simon's daughters, and tried to save mine
also."suddenly exclaimed
Agricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the
missionary.Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly
beneath the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through
which shone upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which
extended from one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible.In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting
events which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near
Cardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with
Gabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the
young missionary.Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son,
Dagobert said:

"Aye, indeed!"And on his hands, too; see, dear father!"exclaimed the blacksmith, with
renewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which the young priest
held out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears."Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!"added Dagobert; "who has
wounded you thus?"and in his turn, taking the other hand of the
missionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of
wounds, and then added, "In Spain, one of my comrades was found and taken
down alive from a cross, erected at the junction of several roads, upon
which the monks had crucified, and left him to die of hunger, thirst, and
agony.Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands, exactly similar to
this upon your hand.""It is evident that your hands
have been pierced through!and Agricola became
grievously agitated."Do not think about it," said Gabriel, reddening with the embarrassment
of modesty."Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the Rocky
Mountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to scalp me, when
Providence snatched me from their hands.""Unfortunate youth," said Dagobert; "without arms then?You had not a
sufficient escort for your protection?""It is not for such as me to carry arms."said Gabriel, sweetly smiling;
"and we are never accompanied by any escort.""Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came it
that they did not defend you?""Yes, alone; without even a guide."exclaimed Dagobert,
scarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting his own
sense of hearing."The Christian faith," said Gabriel, with mild simplicity, "cannot be
implanted by force or violence.It is only by the power of persuasion
that the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.""Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is in
him, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the
blessings it offers to mankind."There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which
was uttered with simple and touching pathos.Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism
thus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now
contemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration
and respect.Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite
unconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his
two friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, "What ails you?"exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great emotion:
"After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had imagined myself to
be about as courageous as any man."Thunder, don't you know that the brave wounds there" (the veteran took
with transport both of Gabriel's hands), "that these wounds are as
glorious--are more glorious than our--than all ours, as warriors by
profession!"exclaimed Agricola; and he added,
with enthusiasm, "Oh, for such priests!How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their
resignation!""I entreat you not to extol me thus," said Gabriel with embarrassment.When I have
gone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone?Was I not under
the eyes of my commanding officer?Were not my comrades there along with
me?In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self
preservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the
shouts and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes
of the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse,
which bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail?Need I state
that I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every
one--the emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough
hide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound.Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game.But are you
not a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone,
unarmed, to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those
whom we attacked--we, who fought in whole squadrons, supported by
artillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?"cried Agricola, "how noble of you to render to
Gabriel this justice!""Oh, dear brother," said Gabriel, "his kindness to me makes him magnify
what was quite natural and simple!"said the veteran soldier; "yes, natural for gallants who have
hearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.""Oh, yes, very rare," said Agricola; "for that kind of courage is the
most admirable of all.Most bravely did you seek almost certain death,
alone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to preach charity
and Christian brotherhood.They seized you, tortured you; and you await
death and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance,
without hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness
issuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips; and
this in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your
magnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you
were rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black
robe!can you still contend that you are not
as brave as he?""And besides, too," resumed Dagobert, "the dear boy did all that for a
thankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never
change his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a bishop!""I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be," said Gabriel to
Dagobert, smiling meekly."If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense
awaits me on high.""As to all that, my boy," said Dagobert, "I do not understand it; and I
will not argue about it.I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would
be at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform.""But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like
Gabriel," said Agricola, "and if you did know, dear father, how much
virtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the priesthood
insolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind
devotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who
are inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly
lawnsleeves!Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in their
vocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand
enfranchisement!Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we
are, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us.You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your
ambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you
understand the good that you could work within it.""My desire is still the same," said Gabriel sadly: "but unfortunately--"
and then, as if he wished to escape from a painful thought, and to change
the conversation, he, addressing himself to Dagobert, added: "Believe me:
be more just than to undervalue your own courage by exalting mine.Your
courage must be very great--very great; for, after a battle, the
spectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a generous and feeling
heart.We, at least, though we may be killed, do not kill."At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,
looked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, "This is most
surprising!""What Gabriel has just told us," replied Dagobert, "brings to my mind
what I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I
advanced in years.Listen, my children: more than once, on the night
after a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,--alone,--by
night,--amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in our
possession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand of
the slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of
my old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has
restored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious
whirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,
'for what have these men been killed?--FOR WHAT--FOR WHAT?'But this
feeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the following
morning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from rushing once
more to the slaughter.But the same thought always recurred when my arm
became weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my
horse, I have said to myself, 'I have killed!--killed!!--killed!!!The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old
soldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past.said Gabriel to him, "all generous hearts feel as you did during
the solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has subsided, and man
is left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his
bosom.""And that should prove, my brave boy," rejoined Dagobert, "that you are
greatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as you call them, have
never abandoned you.* * * * But how the deuce did you escape from the
claws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you?"At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,
that the soldier said to him: "If you ought not or cannot answer my
request, let us say no more about it.""I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother," replied
the missionary with altered voice."Only; it will be difficult for me to
make you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.""Surely," said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, "I must have been deceived
by a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted moment in which I
awaited death with resignation.My enfeebled mind, in spite of me, must
have been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the present hour has
remained inexplicable, would have been more slowly developed; and I
should have known with greater certainty that it was the strange woman--"

Dagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he
also had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had
freed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic."Of her who saved me," was the reply."A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?""Yes," replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections, "a woman,
young and beautiful!"When I asked her, she replied, 'I am the sister of the
distressed!'"asked Dagobert, singularly
interested."'I go wheresoever there is suffering,' she replied," answered
the missionary; "and she departed, going towards the north of
America--towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow,
where the nights are without end.""As in Siberia," said Dagobert, who had become very thoughtful."But," resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who seemed also
to have become more and more absorbed, "in what manner or by what means
did this woman come to your assistance?"The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was
heard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the
fears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted
brother."Agricola," said a sweet voice outside the door, "I wish to
speak with you as soon as possible."The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch's voice, and opened the door.But
the young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark
passage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: "Agricola, it is an hour
since broad day, and you have not yet departed!I have
been watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing
alarming; but they may come any instant to arrest you.Hasten, I conjure
you, your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville."Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been gone.But
I could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with him."said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for, as has been
stated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola."Yes," answered Agricola, "for half an hour he has been with my father
and me.""What happiness I shall have in seeing him again," said the sewing-girl."He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your
mother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young
ladies; but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep.Your mother
has requested me to give you this letter for your father."Well," resumed Mother Bunch, "now that you have seen Gabriel, do not
delay long.Think what a blow it would be for your father, if they came
to arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!""You are right," said Agricola; "it is indispensable that I should
depart--while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my fears were
forgotten.""Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor,
perhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as to
yourself and us."a very few minutes more; and I'll come down."I'll come up
again to apprise you.Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase,
to resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered his
garret."Dear father," he said to Dagobert, "my mother has just received
this letter, and she requests you to read it.""Very well; read it for me, my boy."And Agricola read as follows:

"MADAME.--I understand that your husband has been charged by General Simon
with an affair of very great importance.Will you, as soon as your
husband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at Chartres
without a moment's delay.I am instructed to deliver to himself, and to
no other person, some documents indispensable to the interests of General
Simon."DURAND, Notary at Chartres."Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, "Who can
have told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?""Perhaps, father," said Agricola, "this is the notary to whom you
transmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.""But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his address
was Paris, not Chartres.And, besides," said the soldier, thoughtfully,
"if he has some important documents, why didn't he transmit them to me?""It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as
possible," said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this circumstance would
withdraw his father for about two days, during which time his
(Agricola's) fate would be decided in one way or other."Your counsel is good," replied his father."This thwarts your intentions in some degree?""Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you.Having come happily from Siberia to Paris, it
is not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres, when it is
required on an affair of importance.In twice twenty-four hours I shall
be back again.But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for
Chartres to-day.Luckily, I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife; and
Gabriel, their angel, as they call him, will be here to keep them
company.""That is, unfortunately, impossible," said the missionary, sadly."This
visit on my arrival is also a farewell visit."exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once.said Dagobert; "surely it is not
possible?""I must answer no question upon this subject," said Gabriel, suppressing
a sigh: "but from now, for some time, I cannot, and ought not, come again
into this house.""Why, my brave boy," resumed Dagobert with emotion, "there is something
in thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression.He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments after the
shipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry to see you
enrolled under such a commander."exclaimed Agricola, struck with the identity of
the name with that of the young lady of the golden hair; "was it in
Cardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck?""Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?""Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the time?""No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to return
thanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me that the
person to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.""What a singular coincidence," thought Agricola, "if the young lady
should be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!"This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made
to Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; "Dear father, excuse me; but it is
already late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o'clock."This party is adjourned till my
return from Chartres.Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself."Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the
latter had continued pensive.At the moment when Agricola approached him
to shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him
solemnly, with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished
both the blacksmith and the soldier: "My dear brother, one word more.I
have come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall
have need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),"
added Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert.exclaimed Agricola; "what is the matter?""Yes," replied Gabriel, "I need the advice and assistance of two men of
honor--of two men of resolution;--and I can reckon upon you two--can I
not?At any hour, on whatever day it may be, upon a word from me, will
you come?"Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the
accents of the missionary.Agricola felt an oppression of the heart.If
he should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance,
what could be done?"At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend upon
us," said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested--"You have a father
and a brother; make your own use of them.""Thanks, thanks," said Gabriel, "you set me quite at ease.""I'll tell you what," resumed the soldier, "were it not for your priest's
robe, I should believe, from the manner in which you have spoken to us,
that you are about to be engaged in a duel--in a mortal combat.""Yes; it may be a duel--uncommon and
fearful--at which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as you--A
FATHER and A BROTHER!"Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually
increasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de
Cardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader.Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone,
in Paris.Nothing could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing
than the aspect of this old mansion.Several immense windows, filled with
small squares of glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre
effect of the massive layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which
the fabric was composed.This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected
in the same quarter towards the middle of the last century.It was
surmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which
was reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps.One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which
an arcade led to the vast interior departments.The other front
overlooked the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and,
on this side, wings, approaching the principal part of the structure,
formed a couple of lateral galleries.Like nearly all the other great
habitations of this quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the
garden, what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion.This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a
rotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its
erection.It presented, in every part where it was possible for the
stones to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of
flowers, and chubby cupids.This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de
Cardoville was composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a
peristyle of several steps.A small vestibule led to a circular hall,
lighted from the roof.Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of
smaller rooms, concealed in the upper story, served for minor purposes.These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or
transformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,
the black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the
entire structure repaired.The white stones of which it was built
glistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect
contrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity
of an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic
clumps of verdant trees.The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following
that of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in
the Rue Brise-Miche.The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a
neighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue
sky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of
verdure over the summer-house.The door in the vestibule opened, and the
rays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon
two charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place
in the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its
own, which was very striking.In plain terms two individuals, one of them
a young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that
breed of spaniels called King Charles's, made their appearance under the
peristyle of the rotunda.The name of the young girl was Georgette; the
beautiful little spaniel's was Frisky.Georgette was in her eighteenth
year.Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady's maid of Marivaux, a
more mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more roguish, teeth
more white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish, feet smaller, or
form smarter, attractive, and enticing.Though it was yet very early,
Georgette was carefully and tastefully dressed.A tiny Valenciennes cap,
with flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion, decked with
rose- ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands of beautiful
fair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of gray
levantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a large
tuft of rose- ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly rounded; a
hollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large hems,
surmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round and
flexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,
allowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves,
reaching to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold.When
Georgette raised the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more
quickly the steps, she exhibited to Frisky's indifferent eyes a beautiful
ankle, and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in
white silk, and a charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish
satin.When a blonde like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when
vivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a
joyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin, she is more resistless
for the conquest of everything before her than a brunette.This bewitching and nimble lady's-maid, who on the previous evening had
introduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the
Honorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint
Dizier.Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak
but joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf.She was
not much bigger than one's fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,
shone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her
neck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery
tan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her
large eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that
they trailed upon the ground.Georgette seemed to be as brisk and
petulant as Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,--now scampering after
the happy little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon
the greensward in her turn.All at once, at the sight of a second person,
who advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly
stopped in their diversion.The little King Charles, some steps in
advance of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held
herself firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up
of the enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which,
though of ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp.The enemy
consisted of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the
color of coffee and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was
pot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side;
he walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air
of a doctor.His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs
sallying forth, and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and
altogether he had an expression singularly forbidding and vindictive.This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called a
"church-goer's pug," answered to the name of "My Lord."His mistress, a
woman of about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was
dressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay
and showy.It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat
of the same dye.The features of this woman might have been agreeable in
her youth; and her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes,
which were still very lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and
austere physiognomy which she tried to assume.This matron, of slow and
discreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess
Saint-Dizier.Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two
women present a striking contrast; but the contrast extended itself even
to the animals which attended them.There were similar differences
between Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs.When
the latter perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a
movement of surprise and repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the
young lady's maid.Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the
apparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance,
and even advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the
cur, though thrice as big as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of
distress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs.Grivois, who bitterly
said to Georgette:

"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog
thus, and setting him upon mine.""It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly
animal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky
yesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate.But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,
and brought her back to my mistress.However," continued Georgette, "to
what, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?""I am commanded by the Princess," replied Mrs.Grivois, unable to conceal
a smile of triumphant satisfaction, "immediately to see Miss Adrienne.It
regards a very important affair, which I am to communicate only to
herself."At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight
start of disquietude, which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied
with watching over the safety of her pet, whom Frisky continued to snarl
at with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome
her temporary emotion, firmly answered: "Miss Adrienne went to rest very
late last night.She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid
day.""That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an order
of the Princess her aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to awaken
your mistress immediately.""My mistress is subject to no one's orders in her own house; and I will
not disturb her till mid-day, in pursuance of her commands," replied
Georgette."Then I shall go myself," said Mrs."Florine and Hebe will not admit you.Indeed, here is the key of the
saloon; and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne
be entered."do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the
Princess?""Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my
mistress!"such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her
niece," said the matron, with affected grief: "Miss Adrienne no longer
respects her aunt's orders; and she is surrounded by young hare-brained
persons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress themselves out as if
for ball-going."how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the greatest
coquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess's women.At least, that is what is still spoken of you in the hotel, as having
been handed down from time out of mind, by generation to generation, even
unto ours!"do you mean to insinuate that I am a
hundred years old, Miss Impertinence?""I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is the
utmost if they remain two or three years in the Princess's house, who has
too many tempers for the poor girls!""I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people ought
not to pronounce but on their knees.""However," said Georgette, "if one wished to speak ill of--"

"Do you dare!""No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o'clock--"

"Last night?""A four-wheeler," continued Georgette, "stopped at a few paces from the
house.A mysterious personage, wrapped up in a cloak, alighted from it,
and directly tapped, not at the door, but on the glass of the porter's
lodge window; and at one o'clock in the morning, the cab was still
stationed in the street, waiting for the mysterious personage in the
cloak, who, doubtless, during all that time, was, as you say, pronouncing
the name of her Highness the Princess on his knees."Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the
Princess Saint-Dizier by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the
middle of the night, after he had become certain of the arrival in Paris
of General Simon's daughters; or whether Mrs.Grivois thought it
necessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her
shoulders disdainfully: "I know not what you, mean, madame.I have not
come here to listen to your impertinent stuff.Once again I ask you--will
you, or will you not, introduce me to the presence of Miss Adrienne?""I repeat, madame, that my mistress sleeps, and that she has forbidden me
to enter her bed-chamber before mid-day."This conversation took place at some distance from the summer-house, at a
spot from which the peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand avenue,
terminating in trees arranged in form of a V. All at once Mrs.Grivois,
extending her hand in that direction, exclaimed: "Great heavens!"I saw her run up the porch steps.I perfectly recognized her by her
gait, by her hat, and by her mantle.To come home at eight o'clock in the
morning!"Grivois: "it is perfectly incredible!"and Georgette burst out into
fits of laughter: and then said: "Oh!you wish to out-do my
story of the four-wheeler last night!Grivois, "that I have this moment seen--"

"Oh!Grivois: if you speak seriously, you are mad!"The little gate that
open's on the street lets one into the quincunx near the pavilion.It is
by that door, doubtless, that mademoiselle has re-entered.her presentiments
have not yet been mistaken.See to what her weak indulgence of her
niece's caprices has led her!It is monstrous!--so monstrous, that,
though I have seen her with my own eyes, still I can scarcely believe
it!""Since you've gone so far, ma'am, I now insist upon conducting you into
the apartment of my lady, in order that you may convince yourself, by
your own senses, that your eyes have deceived you!""Oh, you are very cunning, my dear, but not more cunning than I!Yes, yes, I believe you: you are certain that by
this time I shall find her in her apartment!""But, madame, I assure you--"

"All that I can say to you is this: that neither you, nor Florine, nor
Hebe, shall remain here twenty-four hours.The Princess will put an end
to this horrible scandal; for I shall immediately inform her of what has
passed.Re-enter at eight o'clock in the morning!Why, I am all in a whirl!Certainly, if I had not seen it with my own
eyes, I could not have believed it!Still, it is only what was to be
expected.All those to whom I am
going to relate it, will say, I am quite sure, that it is not at all
astonishing!Grivois returned precipitately towards the mansion, followed by her
fat pug, who appeared to be as embittered as herself.Georgette, active and light, ran, on her part, towards the pavilion, in
order to apprise Miss de Cardoville that Mrs.Grivois had seen her, or
fancied she had seen her, furtively enter by the little garden gate.ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET.Grivois had seen or pretended to
have seen Adrienne de Cardoville re-enter in the morning the extension of
Saint-Dizier House.It is for the purpose, not of excusing, but of rendering intelligible,
the following scenes, that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the
light some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of Miss
de Cardoville.This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind, joined
to a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed, and to an
insatiable desire of being surrounded by everything attractive and
beautiful.The painter most delighted with coloring and beauty, the
sculptor most charmed by proportions of form, feel not more than Adrienne
did the noble enthusiasm which the view of perfect beauty always excites
in the chosen favorites of nature.And it was not only the pleasures of sight which this young lady loved to
gratify: the harmonious modulations of song, the melody of instruments,
the cadences of poetry, afforded her infinite pleasures; while a harsh
voice or a discordant noise made her feel the same painful impression, or
one nearly as painful as that which she involuntarily experienced from
the sight of a hideous object.Passionately fond of flowers, too, and of
their sweet scents, there are some perfumes which she enjoyed equally
with the delights of music or those of plastic beauty.It is necessary,
alas, to acknowledge one enormity: Adrienne was dainty in her food!She
valued more than any one else the fresh pulp of handsome fruit, the
delicate savor of a golden pheasant, cooked to a turn, and the odorous
cluster of a generous vine.But Adrienne enjoyed all these pleasures with an exquisite reserve.She
sought religiously to cultivate and refine the senses given her.She
would have deemed it black ingratitude to blunt those divine gifts by
excesses, or to debase them by unworthy selections of objects upon which
to exercise them; a fault from which, indeed, she was preserved by the
excessive and imperious delicacy of her taste.The BEAUTIFUL and the UGLY occupied for her the places which GOOD and
EVIL holds for others.Her devotion to grace, elegance, and physical beauty, had led her also to
the adoration of moral beauty; for if the expression of a low and bad
passion render uncomely the most beautiful countenances, those which are
in themselves the most ugly are ennobled, on the contrary, by the
expression of good feelings and generous sentiments.In a word, Adrienne was the most complete, the most ideal personification
of SENSUALITY--not of vulgar, ignorant, non intelligent, mistaken
sensuousness which is always deceit ful and corrupted by habit or by the
necessity for gross and ill-regulated enjoyments, but that exquisite
sensuality which is to the senses what intelligence is to the soul.The independence of this young lady's character was extreme.Certain
humiliating subjections imposed upon her success by its social position,
above all things were revolting to her, and she had the hardihood to
resolve to withdraw herself from them.She was a woman, the most womanish
that it is possible to imagine--a woman in her timidity as well as in her
audacity--a woman in her hatred of the brutal despotism of men, as well
as in her intense disposition to self-devoting herself, madly even and
blindly, to him who should merit such a devotion from her--a woman whose
piquant wit was occasionally paradoxical--a superior woman, in brief, who
entertained a well-grounded disdain and contempt for certain men either
placed very high or greatly adulated, whom she had from time to time met
in the drawing-room of her aunt, the Princess Saint-Dizier, when she
resided with her.These indispensable explanations being given, we usher, the reader into
the presence of Adrienne de Cardoville, who had just come out of the
bath.It would require all the brilliant colorings of the Venetian school to
represent that charming scene, which would rather seem to have occurred
in the sixteenth century, in some palace of Florence or Bologna, than in
Paris, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the month of February, 1832.Adrienne's dressing-room was a kind of miniature temple seemingly one
erected and dedicated to the worship of beauty, in gratitude to the Maker
who has lavished so many charms upon woman, not to be neglected by her,
or to cover and conceal them with ashes, or to destroy them by the
contact of her person with sordid and harsh haircloth; but in order that,
with fervent gratitude for the divine gifts wherewith she is endowed, she
may enhance her charms with all the illusions of grace and all the
splendors of apparel, so as to glorify the divine work of her own
perfections in the eyes of all.Daylight was admitted into this
semicircular apartment, through one of those double windows, contrived
for the preservation of heat, so happily imported from Germany.The walls
of the pavilion being constructed of stone of great thickness, the depth
of the aperture for the windows was therefore very great.That of
Adrienne's dressing-room was closed on the outside by a sash containing a
single large pane of plate glass, and within, by another large plate of
ground glass.In the interval or space of about three feet left between
these two transparent enclosures, there was a case or box filled with
furze mould, whence sprung forth climbing plants, which, directed round
the ground glass, formed a rich garland of leaves and flowers.A garnet
damask tapestry, rich with harmoniously blended arabesques, in the purest
style, covered the walls and a thick carpet of similar color was extended
over the floor: and this sombre ground, presented by the floor and walls,
marvellously enhanced the effects of all the harmonious ornaments and
decorations of the chamber.Under the window, opposite to the south, was placed Adrienne's dressing
case, a real masterpiece of the skill of the goldsmith.Upon a large
tablet of lapis-lazuli, there were scattered boxes of jewels, their lids
precisely enamelled; several scent boxes of rock crystal, and other
implements and utensils of the toilet, some formed of shells, some of
mother-of-pearl, and others of ivory, covered with ornaments of gold in
extraordinary taste.Two large figures, modelled in silver with antique
purity; supported an oval swing mirror, which had for its rim, in place
of a frame curiously carved, a fresh garland of natural flowers, renewed
every day like a nosegay for a ball.Two enormous Japanese vases, of purple and gold, three feet each in
diameter, were placed upon the carpet on each side of the toilet, and,
filled with camellias, ibiscures, and cape jasmine, in full flower formed
a sort of grove, diversified with the most brilliant colors.At the
farther end of the apartment, opposite the casement, was to be seen,
surrounded by another mass of flowers, a reduction in white marble of the
enchanting group of Daphnis and Chloe, the more chaste ideal of graceful
modesty and youthful beauty.Two golden lamps burned perfumes upon the same pedestal which supported
those two charming figures.A coffer of frosted silver, set off with
small figures in jewelry and precious stones, and supported on four feet
of gilt bronze, contained various necessaries for the toilette; two
frosted Psyches, decorated with diamond ear-rings; some excellent
drawings from Raphael and Titian, painted by Adrienne herself, consisting
of portraits of both men and women of exquisite beauty; several consoles
of oriental jasper, supporting ewers and basins of silver and of silver
gilt, richly chased and filled with scented waters; a voluptuously rich
divan, some seats, and an illuminated gilt fable, completed the furniture
of this chamber, the atmosphere of which was impregnated with the
sweetest perfumes.Adrienne, whom her attendants had just helped from the bath, was seated
before her toilette, her three women surrounding her.By a caprice, or
rather by a necessary and logical impulse of her soul, filled as it was
with the love of beauty and of harmony in all things, Adrienne had wished
the young women who served her to be very pretty, and be dressed with
attention and with a charming originality.We have already seen
Georgette, a piquante blonde, attired in her attractive costume of an
intriguing lady's maid of Marivaux; and her two companions were quite
equal to her both in gracefulness and gentility.One of them, named Florine, a tall, delicately slender, and elegant girl,
with the air and form of Diana Huntress, was of a pale brown complexion.Her thick black hair was turned up behind, where it was fastened with a
long golden pin.Like the two other girls, her arms were uncovered to
facilitate the performance of her duties about and upon the person of her
charming mistress.She wore a dress of that gay green so familiar to the
Venetian painters.Her slender waist curved
in from under the plaits of a tucker of white cambric, plaited in five
minute folds, and fastened by five gold buttons.The third of Adrienne's
women had a face so fresh and ingenuous, a waist so delicate, so
pleasing, and so finished, that her mistress had given her the name of
Hebe.Her dress of a delicate rose color, and Grecian cut, displayed her
charming neck, and her beautiful arms up to the very shoulders.The
physiognomy of these three young women was laughter loving and happy.On
their features there was no expression of that bitter sullenness, willing
and hated obedience, or offensive familiarity, or base and degraded
deference, which are the ordinary results of a state of servitude.In the
zealous eagerness of the cares and attentions which they lavished upon
Adrienne, there seemed to be at least as much of affection as of
deference and respect.They appeared to derive an ardent pleasure from
the services which they rendered to their lovely mistress.One would have
thought that they attached to the dressing and embellishment of her
person all the merits and the enjoyment arising from the execution of a
work of art, in the accomplishing of which, fruitful of delights, they
were stimulated by the passions of love, of pride, and of joy.The sun beamed brightly upon the toilet-case, placed in front of the
window.Adrienne was seated on a chair, its back elevated a little more
than usual.She was enveloped in a long morning-gown of blue silk,
embroidered with a leaf of the same color, which was fitted close to her
waist, as exquisitely slender and delicate as that of a child of twelve
years, by a girdle with floating tags.Her neck, delicately slender and
flexible as a bird's, was uncovered, as were also her shoulders and arms,
and all were of incomparable beauty.Despite the vulgarity of the
comparison, the purest ivory alone can give an idea of the dazzling
whiteness of her polished satin skin, of a texture so fresh and so firm,
that some drops of water, collected and still remaining about the roots
of her hair from the bath, rolled in serpentine lines over her shoulders,
like pearls, or beads, of crystal, over white marble.And what gave enhanced lustre to this wondrous carnation, known but to
auburn-headed beauties, was the deep purple of her, humid lips,--the
roseate transparency of her small ears, of her dilated nostrils, and her
nails, as bright and glossy, as if they had been varnished.In every
spot, indeed, where her pure arterial blood, full of animation and heat,
could make its way to the skin and shine through the surface, it
proclaimed her high health and the vivid life and joyous buoyancy of her
glorious youth.Her eyes were very large, and of a velvet softness.Now
they glanced, sparkling and shining with comic humor or intelligence and
wit; and now they widened and extended themselves, languishing and
swimming between their double fringes of long crisp eyelashes, of as deep
a black as her finely-drawn and exquisitely arched eyebrows; for, by a
delightful freak of nature, she had black eyebrows and eyelashes to
contrast with the golden red of her hair.Her forehead, small like those
of ancient Grecian statues, formed with the rest of her face a perfect
oval.Her nose, delicately curved, was slightly aquiline; the enamel of
her teeth glistened when the light fell upon them; and her vermeil mouth
voluptuously sensual, seemed to call for sweet kisses, and the gay smiles
and delectations of dainty and delicious pleasure.It is impossible to
behold or to conceive a carriage of the head freer, more noble, or more
elegant than hers; thanks to the great distance which separated the neck
and the ear from their attachment to her outspread and dimpled shoulders.We have already said that Adrienne was red-haired; but it was the redness
of many of the admirable portraits of women by Titian and Leonardo da
Vinci,--that is to say, molten gold presents not reflections more
delightfully agreeable or more glittering, than the naturally undulating
mass of her very long hair, as soft and fine as silk, so long, that, when
let loose, it reached the floor; in it, she could wholly envelop herself,
like another Venus arising from the sea.At the present moment,
Adrienne's tresses were ravishing to behold; Georgette, her arms bare,
stood behind her mistress, and had carefully collected into one of her
small white hands, those splendid threads whose naturally ardent
brightness was doubled in the sunshine.When the pretty lady's-maid
pulled a comb of ivory into the midst of the undulating and golden waves
of that enormously magnificent skein of silk, one might have said that a
thousand sparks of fire darted forth and coruscated away from it in all
directions.The sunshine, too, reflected not less golden and fiery rays
from numerous clusters of spiral ringlets, which, divided upon Adrienne's
forehead, fell over her cheeks, and in their elastic flexibility caressed
the risings of her snowy bosom, to whose charming undulations they
adapted and applied themselves.Whilst Georgette, standing, combed the
beautiful locks of her mistress, Hebe, with one knee upon the floor, and
having upon the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville, busied
herself in fitting it with a remarkably small shoe of black satin, and
crossed its slender ties over a silk stocking of a pale yet rosy flesh
color, which imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world.Florine, a little farther back, presented to her mistress, in a jeweled
box, a perfumed paste, with which Adrienne slightly rubbed her dazzling
hands and outspread fingers, which seemed tinted with carmine to their
extremities.Let us not forget Frisky, who, couched in the lap of her
mistress, opened her great eyes with all her might, and seemed to observe
the different operations of Adrienne's toilette with grave and reflective
attention.A silver bell being sounded from without, Florine, at a sign
from her mistress, went out and presently returned, bearing a letter upon
a small silver-gilt salve.Adrienne, while her women continued fitting on
her shoes, dressing her hair, and arranging her in her habiliments, took
the letter, which was written by the steward of the estate of Cardoville,
and read aloud as follows:

"HONORED MADAME,

"Knowing your goodness of heart and generosity, I venture to address you
with respectful confidence.During twenty years I served the late Count
and Duke of Cardoville, your noble father, I believe I may truly say,
with probity and zeal.The castle is now sold; so that I and my wife, in
our old age, behold ourselves about to be dismissed, and left destitute
of all resources: which, alas!said Adrienne, interrupting herself in reading: "my
father, certainly, always prided himself upon their devotion to him, and
their probity."She continued:

"There does, indeed, remain to us a means of retaining our place here;
but it would constrain us to be guilty of baseness; and, be the
consequences to us what they may, neither I nor my wife wish to purchase
our bread at such a price.""Good, very good," said Adrienne, "always the same--dignity even in
poverty--it is the sweet perfume of a flower, not the less sweet because
it has bloomed in a meadow.""In order to explain to you, honored madame, the unworthy task exacted
from us, it is necessary to inform you, in the first place, that M. Rodin
came here from Paris two days ago."said Mademoiselle de Cardoville, interrupting herself
anew; "the secretary of Abbe d'Aigrigny!I am not at all surprised at him
being engaged in a perfidious or black intrigue."M. Rodin came from Paris to announce to us that the estate was sold, and
that he was sure of being able to obtain our continuance in our place, if
we would assist him in imposing a priest not of good character upon the
new proprietress as her future confessor; and if, the better to attain
this end, we would consent to calumniate another priest, a deserving and
excellent man, much loved and much respected in the country.I was required to write twice or thrice a week to M. Rodin, and
to relate to him everything that should occur in the house.I ought to
acknowledge, honored madame, that these infamous proposals were as much
as possible disguised and dissimulated under sufficiently specious
pretexts; but, notwithstanding the aspect which with more or less skill
it was attempted to give to the affair, it was precisely and
substantially what I have now had the honor of stating to you.""Corruption, calumny, and false and treacherous impeachment!"said
Adrienne, with disgust: "I cannot think of such wretches without
involuntarily feeling my mind shocked by dismal ideas of black, venomous,
and vile reptiles, of aspects most hideous indeed.How much more do I
love to dwell upon the consoling thought of honest Dupont and his wife!"Adrienne proceeded:

"Believe me, we hesitated not an instant.We quit Cardoville, which has
been our home for the last twenty years;--but we shall quit it like
honest people, and with the consciousness of our integrity.And now,
honored madame, if, in the brilliant circle in which you move--you, who
are so benevolent and amiable--could find a place for us by your
recommendation, then, with endless gratitude to you, we shall escape from
a position of most cruel embarrassment.""Surely, surely," said Adrienne, "they shall not in vain appeal to me.To
wrest excellent persons from the grip of M. Rodin, is not only a duty but
a pleasure: for it is at once a righteous and a dangerous enterprise; and
dearly do I love to brave powerful oppressors!"Adrienne again went on
reading:

"After having thus spoken to you of ourselves, honored madame, permit us
to implore your protection for other unfortunates; for it would be wicked
to think only of one's self.Three days ago, two shipwrecks took place
upon our ironbound coast.A few passengers only were saved, and were
conducted hither, where I and my wife gave them all necessary attentions.All these passengers have departed for Paris, except one, who still
remains, his wounds having hitherto prevented him from leaving the house,
and, indeed, they will constrain him to remain for some days to come.He
is a young East Indian prince, of about twenty years of age, and he
appears to be as amiable and good as he is handsome, which is not a
little to say, though he has a tawny skin, like the rest of his
countrymen, as I understand."exclaimed Adrienne, gayly; "this is quite delightful, and not at all of
an ordinary or vulgar nature!this Indian prince has already awakened
all my sympathies!But what can I do with this Adonis from the banks of
the Ganges, who has come to wreck himself upon the Picardy coast?"Adrienne's three women looked at her with much astonishment, though they
were accustomed to the singular eccentricities of her character.Georgette and Hebe even indulged in discreet and restrained smiles.Florine, the tall and beautiful pale brown girl, also smiled like her
pretty companions; but it was after a short pause of seeming reflection,
as if she had previously been entirely engrossed in listening to and
recollecting the minutest words of her mistress, who, though powerfully
interested by the situation of the "Adonis from Ganges banks," as she had
called him, continued to read Dupont's letter:

"One of the countrymen of the Indian prince, who has also remained to
attend upon him, has given me to understand that the youthful prince has
lost in the shipwreck all he possessed, and knows not how to get to
Paris, where his speedy presence is required by some affairs of the very
greatest importance.It is not from the prince himself that I have
obtained this information: no; he appears to be too dignified and proud
to proclaim of his fate: but his countryman, more communicative,
confidentially told me what I have stated, adding, that his young
compatriot has already been subjected to great calamities, and that his
father, who was the sovereign of an Indian kingdom, has been killed by
the English, who have also dispossessed his son of his crown.""This is very singular," said Adrienne, thoughtfully."These
circumstances recall to my mind that my father often mentioned that one
of our relations was espoused in India by a native monarch; and that
General Simon: (whom they have created a marshal) had entered into his
service."Then interrupting herself to indulge in a smile, she added,
"Gracious!this affair will be quite odd and fantastical!Such things
happen to nobody but me; and then people say that I am the uncommon
creature!But it seems to me that it is not I, but Providence, which, in
truth, sometimes shows itself very eccentric!But let us see if worthy
Dupont gives the name of this handsome prince?""We trust, honored madame, that you will pardon our boldness: but we
should have thought ourselves very selfish, if, while stating to you our
own griefs, we had not also informed you that there is with us a brave
and estimable prince involved in so much distress.In fine, lady, trust
to me; I am old; and I have had much experience of men; and it was only
necessary to see the nobleness of expression and the sweetness of
countenance of this young Indian, to enable me to judge that he is worthy
of the interest which I have taken the liberty to request in his behalf.It would be sufficient to transmit to him a small sum of money for the
purchase of some European clothing; for he has lost all his Indian
vestments in the shipwreck."Heaven preserve him from that; and me also!Chance has sent
hither from the heart of India, a mortal so far favored as never to have
worn the abominable European costume--those hideous habits, and frightful
hats, which render the men so ridiculous, so ugly, that in truth there is
not a single good quality to be discovered in them, nor one spark of what
can either captivate or attract!There comes to me at last a handsome
young prince from the East, where the men are clothed in silk and
cashmere.Most assuredly I'll not miss this rare and unique opportunity
of exposing myself to a very serious and formidable temptation!not a European dress for me, though poor Dupont requests it!But the
name--the name of this dear prince!Once more, what a singular event is
this!If it should turn out to be that cousin from beyond the Ganges!During my childhood, I have heard so much in praise of his royal father!I shall be quite ravished to give his son the kind reception which he
merits!"And then she read on:

"If, besides this small sum, honored madame, you are so kind as to give
him, and also his companion, the means of reaching Paris, you will confer
a very great service upon this poor young prince, who is at present so
unfortunate."To conclude, I know enough of your delicacy to be aware that it would
perhaps be agreeable to you to afford this succor to the prince without
being known as his benefactress; in which case, I beg that you will be
pleased to command me; and you may rely upon my discretion.If, on the
contrary, you wish to address it directly to himself, his name is, as it
has been written for me by his countrymen, Prince Djalma, son of Radja
sing, King of Mundi."said Adrienne, quickly, and appearing to call up her
recollections, "Radja-sing!These are the very names
that my father so often repeated, while telling me that there was nothing
more chivalric or heroic in the world than the old king, our relation by
marriage; and the son has not derogated, it would seem, from that
character.Yes, Djalma, Radja-sing--once more, that is it--such names are
not so common," she added, smiling, "that one should either forget or
confound them with others.above all, he has never worn the horrid
European dress!Quick, quick let us improvise a pretty
fairy tale, of which the handsome and beloved prince shall be the hero!The poor bird of the golden and azure plumage has wandered into our
dismal climate; but he will find here, at least, something to remind him
of his native region of sunshine and perfumes!"Then, addressing one of
her women, she said: "Georgette, take paper and write, my child!"The
young girl went to the gilt, illuminated table, which contained materials
for writing; and, having seated herself, she said to her mistress: "I
await orders."Adrienne de Cardoville, whose charming countenance was radiant with the
gayety of happiness and joy, proceeded to dictate the following letter to
a meritorious old painter, who had long since taught her the arts of
drawing and designing; in which arts she excelled, as indeed she did in
all others:

"MY DEAR TITIAN, MY GOOD VERONESE, MY WORTHY RAPHAEL."You can render me a very great service,--and you will do it, I am sure,
with that perfect and obliging complaisance by which you are ever
distinguished."It is to go immediately and apply yourself to the skillful hand who
designed my last costumes of the fifteenth century.But the present
affair is to procure modern East Indian dresses for a young man--yes,
sir--for a young man,--and according to what I imagine of him, I fancy
that you can cause his measure to be taken from the Antinous, or rather,
from the Indian Bacchus; yes--that will be more likely."It is necessary that these vestments be at once of perfect propriety and
correctness, magnificently rich, and of the greatest elegance.You will
choose the most beautiful stuffs possible; and endeavor, above all
things, that they be, or resemble, tissues of Indian manufacture; and you
will add to them, for turbans and sashes, six splendid long cashmere
shawls, two of them white, two red, and two orange; as nothing suits
brown complexions better than those colors."This done (and I allow you at the utmost only two or three days), you
will depart post in my carriage for Cardoville Manor House, which you
know so well.The steward, the excellent Dupont, one of your old friends,
will there introduce you to a young Indian Prince, named Djalma; and you
will tell that most potent grave, and reverend signior, of another
quarter of the globe, that you have come on the part of an unknown
friend, who, taking upon himself the duty of a brother, sends him what is
necessary to preserve him from the odious fashions of Europe.You will
add, that his friend expects him with so much impatience that he conjures
him to come to Paris immediately.If he objects that he is suffering, you
will tell him that my carriage is an excellent bed-closet; and you will
cause the bedding, etc., which it contains, to be fitted up, till he
finds it quite commodious.Remember to make very humble excuses for the
unknown friend not sending to the prince either rich palanquins, or even,
modestly, a single elephant; for alas!palanquins are only to be seen at
the opera; and there are no elephants but those in the menagerie,--though
this must make us seem strangely barbarous in his eyes."As soon as you shall have decided on your departure, perform the journey
as rapidly as possible, and bring here, into my house, in the Rue de
Babylone (what predestination!that I should dwell in the street of
BABYLON,--a name which must at least accord with the ear of an
Oriental),--you will bring hither, I say, this dear prince, who is so
happy as to have been born in a country of flowers, diamonds, and sun!"Above all, you will have the kindness, my old and worthy friend, not to
be at all astonished at this new freak, and refrain from indulging in
extravagant conjectures.Seriously, the choice which I have made of you
in this affair,--of you, whom I esteem and most sincerely honor,--is
because it is sufficient to say to you that, at the bottom of all this,
there is something more than a seeming act of folly."In uttering these last words, the tone of Adrienne was as serious and
dignified as it had been previously comic and jocose.But she quickly
resumed, more gayly, dictating to Georgette.I am something like that commander of ancient
days, whose heroic nose and conquering chin you have so often made me
draw: I jest with the utmost freedom of spirit even in the moment of
battle: yes, for within an hour I shall give battle, a pitched battle--to
my dear pew-dwelling aunt.Fortunately, audacity and courage never failed
me, and I burn with impatience for the engagement with my austere
princess."A kiss, and a thousand heartfelt recollections to your excellent wife.If I speak of her here, who is so justly respected, you will please to
understand, it is to make you quite at ease as to the consequences of
this running away with, for my sake, a charming young prince,--for it is
proper to finish well where I should have begun, by avowing to you that
he is charming indeed!Then, addressing Georgette, said she, "Have you done writing, chit?""P.S.--I send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses.You know I am quite a grand seigneur.I must use this masculine
expression, since your sex have exclusively appropriated to yourselves
(tyrants as you are) a term, so significant as it is of noble
generosity.""Now, Georgette," said Adrienne; "bring me an envelope, and the letter,
that I may sign it."Mademoiselle de Cardoville took the pen that
Georgette presented to her, signed the letter, and enclosed in it an
order upon her banker, which was expressed thus:

"Please pay M. Norval, on demand without grace, the sum of money he may
require for expenses incurred on my account."ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE."During all this scene, while Georgette wrote, Florine and Hebe had
continued to busy themselves with the duties of their mistress's
toilette, who had put off her morning gown, and was now in full dress, in
order to wait upon the princess, her aunt.From the sustained and
immovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne's
dictating to Georgette her letter to M. Norval, it might easily have been
seen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored to retain in her
memory even the slightest words of her mistress."Now, chit," said Adrienne to Hebe, "send this letter immediately to M.The same silver bell was again rung from without.Hebe moved towards the
door of the dressing-room, to go and inquire what it was, and also to
execute the order of her mistress as to the letter.But Florine
precipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her
leaving the apartment; and said to Adrienne:

"Will it please my lady for me to send this letter?I have occasion to go
to the mansion.""Go, Florine, then," said Adrienne, "seeing that you wish it.Georgette,
seal the letter."At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the
letter, Hebe returned."Madame," said she, re-entering, "the working-man who brought back Frisky
yesterday, entreats you to admit him for an instant.He is very pale, and
he appears quite sad.""Would that he may already have need of me!"Show the excellent young man into the little saloon.And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately."Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the
little reception-room, where Agricola awaited her.When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected
her, she was dressed with extremely elegant simplicity.A robe of deep
blue, perfectly fitted to her shape, embroidered in front with
interlacings of black silk, according to the then fashion, outlined her
nymph-like figure, and her rounded bosom.A French cambric collar,
fastened by a large Scotch pebble, set as a brooch, served her for a
necklace.Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework for her fair
countenance, with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral
tresses, which reached nearly to her waist.Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him
believe that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been
obliged to array himself in his working dress; he had put on a new blouse
though, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white, fell
over upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his
well polished boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a
cap of fine woolen cloth, quite new.To sum up, his blue blouse,
embroidered with red, showing off the nervous chest of the young
blacksmith, and indicating his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful
folds, put not the least constraint upon his free and easy gait, and
became him much better than either frock-coat or dress-coat would have
done.While awaiting Miss de Cardoville, Agricola mechanically examined a
magnificent silver vase, admirably graven.A small tablet, of the same
metal, fitted into a cavity of its antique stand, bore the words--"Chased
by JEAN MARIE, working chaser, 1831."Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only
separated from another apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not
perceived the young lady's entrance.He started, and turned quickly
round, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-"That is a
beautiful vase, is it not, sir?""Very beautiful, madame," answered Agricola greatly embarrassed."You may see from it that I like what is equitable."added Miss de
Cardoville, pointing with her finger to the little silver tablet;--"an
artist puts his name upon his painting; an author publishes his on the
title-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have
his name connected with his workmanship.""Oh, madame, so this name?""Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the order
of a rich goldsmith.When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed at
my eccentricity, he would have almost said at my injustice, when, after
having made him tell me the name of the author of this production, I
ordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the
goldsmith, which had already been affixed to the stand.In the absence of
the rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill.It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation
more graciously: so that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a
little more at ease, answered:

"Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by such
a proof of your sense of equity and justice.""Since you are a mechanic, sir," resumed Adrienne, "I cannot but
felicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer.With a gesture full of affability, she pointed to an armchair of purple
silk embroidered with gold, sitting down herself upon a tete-a-tete of
the same materials.Seeing Agricola's hesitation, who again cast down his eyes with
embarrassment, Adrienne, to encourage him, showed him Frisky, and said to
him gayly: "This poor little animal, to which I am very much attached,
will always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging complaisance,
sir.And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury; I know not what
good presentiment whispers to me, that perhaps I shall have the pleasure
of being useful to you in some affair.""Madame," said Agricola, resolutely, "my name is Baudoin: a blacksmith in
the employment of M. Hardy, at Pressy, near the city.Yesterday you
offered me your purse and I refused it: to-day, I have come to request of
you perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had generously proposed.I have said thus much all at once, madame, because it causes me the
greatest effort.The words blistered my lips, but now I shall be more at
ease.""I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples, sir," said Adrienne; "but if
you knew me, you would address me without fear."I do not know, madame," answered Agricola."No madame; and I come to you to request, not only the sum necessary to
me, but also information as to what that sum is.""Let us see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling, "explain this to me.In spite
of my good will, you feel that I cannot divine, all at once, what it is
that is required.""Madame, in two words, I can state the truth.I have a food old mother,
who in her youth, broke her health by excessive labor, to enable her to
bring me up; and not only me, but a poor abandoned child whom she had
picked up.It is my turn now to maintain her; and that I have the
happiness of doing.But in order to do so, I have only my labor.If I am
dragged from my employment, my mother will be without support.""Your mother cannot want for anything now, sir, since I interest myself
for her.""You will interest yourself for her, madame?""But you don't know her," exclaimed the blacksmith.said Agricola, with emotion, after a moment's silence.said Adrienne, looking at Agricola with a very surprised
air; for what he said to her was an enigma.The blacksmith, who blushed not for his friends, replied frankly."Madame, permit me to explain, to you.Mother Bunch is a poor and very
industrious young workwoman, with whom I have been brought up.She is
deformed, which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch.But though,
on the one hand, she is sunk, as low as you are highly elevated on the
other, yet as regards the heart--as to delicacy--oh, lady, I am certain
that your heart is of equal worth with hers!That was at once her own
thought, after I had related to her in what manner, yesterday, you had
presented me with that beautiful flower.""I can assure you, sir," said Adrienne, sincerely touched, "that this
comparison flatters and honors me more than anything else that you could
say to me,--a heart that remains good and delicate, in spite of cruel
misfortunes, is so rare a treasure; while it is very easy to be good,
when we have youth and beauty, and to be delicate and generous, when we
are rich.I accept, then, your comparison; but on condition that you will
quickly put me in a situation to deserve it.In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville, there was
always observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises
from independence of character, so much elevation of soul and nobleness
of sentiment that Agricola, forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his
protectress, rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate
and kindly, though profound respect, which offered a singular and
striking contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who
inspired him with this sentiment."If my mother alone, madame, were exposed to the rigor which I dread.I
should not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory
suspension of my employment.Among poor people, the poor help one
another; and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house, our
excellent neighbors, who would willingly succor her.But, they themselves
are far from being well off; and as they would incur privations by
assisting her, their little benefit would still be more painful to my
mother than the endurance even of misery by herself.And besides, it is
not only for my mother that my exertions are required, but for my father,
whom we have not seen for eighteen years, and who has just arrived from
Siberia, where he remained during all that time, from zealous devotion to
his former general, now Marshal Simon."said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of much
surprise."Do you know the marshal, madame?""I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family."exclaimed the blacksmith, "then the two young ladies, his
daughters, whom my father has brought from Russia, are your relations!"asked Adrienne, more and more
astonished and interested."Yes, madame, two little angels of fifteen or sixteen, and so pretty, so
sweet; they are twins so very much alike, as to be mistaken for one
another.Their mother died in exile; and the little she possessed having
been confiscated, they have come hither with my father, from the depths
of Siberia, travelling very wretchedly; but he tried to make them forget
so many privations by the fervency of his devotion and his tenderness.you will not believe, madame, that, with the courage of
a lion, he has all the love and tenderness of a mother.""And where are the dear children, sir?"It is that which renders my position so very hard;
that which has given me courage to come to you; it is not but that my
labor would be sufficient for our little household, even thus augmented;
but that I am about to be arrested.""Pray, madame, have the goodness to read this letter, which has been sent
by some one to Mother Bunch."Agricola gave to Miss de Cardoville the anonymous letter which had been
received by the workwoman.After having read the letter, Adrienne said to the blacksmith, with
surprise, "It appears, sir, you are a poet!""I have neither the ambition nor the pretension to be one, madame.Only,
when I return to my mother after a day's toil, and often, even while
forging my iron, in order to divert and relax my attention, I amuse
myself with rhymes, sometimes composing an ode, sometimes a song.""And your song of the Freed Workman, which is mentioned in this letter,
is, therefore, very disaffected--very dangerous?""Oh, no, madame; quite the contrary.For myself, I have the good fortune
to be employed in the factory of M. Hardy, who renders the condition of
his workpeople as happy as that of their less fortunate comrades is the
reverse; and I had limited myself to attempt, in favor of the great mass
of the working classes, an equitable, sincere, warm, and earnest
claim--nothing more.But you are aware, perhaps, Madame, that in times of
conspiracy, and commotion, people are often incriminated and imprisoned
on very slight grounds.Should such a misfortune befall me, what will
become of my mother, my father, and the two orphans whom we are bound to
regard as part of our family until the return of their father, Marshal
Simon?It is on this account, madame, that, if I remain, I run the risk
of being arrested.I have come to you to request you to provide surety
for me; so that I should not be compelled to exchange the workshop for
the prison, in which case I can answer for it that the fruits of my labor
will suffice for all."said Adrienne, gayly, "this affair will arrange itself
quite easily.Poet, you shall draw your inspirations in
the midst of good fortune instead of adversity.But first of
all, bonds shall be given for you.""Oh, madame, you have saved us!""To continue," said Adrienne, "the physician of our family is intimately
connected with a very important minister (understand that, as you like,"
said she, smiling, "you will not deceive yourself much).The doctor
exercises very great influence over this great statesman; for he has
always had the happiness of recommending to him, on account of his
health; the sweets and repose of private life, to the very eve of the day
on which his portfolio was taken from him.Keep yourself, then, perfectly
at ease.If the surety be insufficient, we shall be able to devise some
other means."Madame," said Agricola, with great emotion, "I am indebted to you for
the repose, perhaps for the life of my mother.Believe that I shall ever
be grateful."It is proper that those
who have too much should have the right of coming to the aid of those who
have too little.Marshal Simon's daughters are members of my family, and
they will reside here with me, which will be more suitable.You will
apprise your worthy mother of this; and in the evening, besides going to
thank her for the hospitality which she has shown to my young relations,
I shall fetch them home."At this moment Georgette, throwing open the door which separated the room
from an adjacent apartment, hurriedly entered, with an affrighted look,
exclaiming:

"Oh, madame, something extraordinary is going on in the street.""I went to conduct my dressmaker to the little garden-gate," said
Georgette; "where I saw some ill-looking men, attentively examining the
walls and windows of the little out-building belonging to the pavilion,
as if they wished to spy out some one.""Madame," said Agricola, with chagrin, "I have not been deceived."I thought I was followed, from the moment when I left the Rue St.Merry:
and now it is beyond doubt.They must have seen me enter your house; and
are on the watch to arrest me.Well, now that your interest has been
acquired for my mother,--now that I have no farther uneasiness for
Marshal Simon's daughters,--rather than hazard your exposure to anything
the least unpleasant, I run to deliver myself up.""Beware of that sir," said Adrienne, quickly."Liberty is too precious to
be voluntarily sacrificed.Besides, Georgette may have been mistaken.But
in any case, I entreat you not to surrender yourself.Take my advice, and
escape being arrested.That, I think, will greatly facilitate my
measures; for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great desire to keep
possession of those upon whom she has once pounced.""Madame," said Hebe, now also entering with a terrified look, "a man
knocked at the little door, and inquired if a young man in a blue blouse
has not entered here.He added, that the person whom he seeks is named
Agricola Baudoin, and that he has something to tell him of great
importance.""That's my name," said Agricola; "but the important information is a
trick to draw me out.""Evidently," said Adrienne; "and therefore we must play off trick for
trick.added she, addressing herself to
Hebe."I answered, that I didn't know what he was talking about.""Quite right," said Adrienne: "and the man who put the question?""Without doubt to come back again, soon," said Agricola."That is very probable," said Adrienne, "and therefore, sir, it is
necessary for you to remain here some hours with resignation.I am
unfortunately obliged to go immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier, my
aunt, for an important interview, which can no longer be delayed, and is
rendered more pressing still by what you have told me concerning the
daughters of Marshal Simon.Remain here, then, sir; since if you go out,
you will certainly be arrested.""Madame, pardon my refusal; but I must say once more that I ought not to
accept this generous offer.""They have tried to draw me out, in order to avoid penetrating with the
power of the law into your dwelling but if I go not out, they will come
in; and never will I expose you to anything so disagreeable.Now that I
am no longer uneasy about my mother, what signifies prison?""And the grief that your mother will feel, her uneasiness, and her
fears,--nothing?Think of your father; and that poor work-woman who loves
you as a brother, and whom I value as a sister;--say, sir, do you forget
them also?Believe me, it is better to spare those torments to your
family.Remain here; and before the evening I am certain, either by
giving surety, or some other means, of delivering you from these
annoyances.""But, madame, supposing that I do accept your generous offer, they will
come and find me here."There is in this pavilion, which was formerly the abode of a
nobleman's left-handed wife,--you see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling,
"that live in a very profane place--there is here a secret place of
concealment, so wonderfully well-contrived, that it can defy all
searches.You will be very well
accommodated.You will even be able to write some verses for me, if the
place inspire you.""Oh, sir, I will tell you.Admitting that your character and your
position do not entitle you to any interest;--admitting that I may not
owe a sacred debt to your father for the touching regards and cares he
has bestowed upon the daughters of Marshal Simon, my relations--do you
forget Frisky, sir?"asked Adrienne, laughing,--"Frisky, there, whom you
have restored to my fondles?Seriously, if I laugh," continued this
singular and extravagant creature, "it is because I know that you are
entirely out of danger, and that I feel an increase of happiness.Therefore, sir, write for me quickly your address, and your mother's, in
this pocket-book; follow Georgette; and spin me some pretty verses, if
you do not bore yourself too much in that prison to which you fly."While Georgette conducted the blacksmith to the hiding-place, Hebe
brought her mistress a small gray beaver hat with a gray feather; for
Adrienne had to cross the park to reach the house occupied by the
Princess Saint-Dizier.A quarter of an hour after this scene, Florine entered mysteriously the
apartment of Mrs.Grivois, the first woman of the princess."Here are the notes which I have taken this morning," said Florine,
putting a paper into the duenna's hand."Happily, I have a good memory.""At what time exactly did she return home this morning?""She did not go out, madame.We put her in the bath at nine o'clock.""But before nine o'clock she came home, after having passed the night out
of her house.Eight o'clock was the time at which she returned, however."Grivois with profound astonishment, and said-"I do
not understand you, madame."Madame did not come home this morning at eight o'clock?"I was ill yesterday, and did not come down till nine this morning, in
order to assist Georgette and Hebe help our young lady from the bath.I
know nothing of what passed previously, I swear to you, madame."You must ferret out what I allude to from your
companions.They don't distrust you, and will tell you all.""What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her?""Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M. Norval, I requested
permission to send it off, as a pretext for going out, and for writing
down all I recollected.""Jerome had to go out, and I gave it him to put in the post-office."Grivois: "couldn't you bring it to me?""But, as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette, as is her custom, I knew
the contents of the letter; and I have written it in my notes."It is likely there was need to delay sending
off this letter; the princess will be very much displeased.""I thought I did right, madame.""I know that it is not good will that fails you.For these six months I
have been satisfied with you.But this time you have committed a very
great mistake."Grivois looked fixedly at her, and said in a sardonic tone:

"Very well, my dear, do not continue it.If you have scruples, you are
free."You well know that I am not free, madame," said Florine, reddening; and
with tears in her eyes she added: "I am dependent upon M. Rodin, who
placed me here.""In spite of one's self, one feels remorse.Madame is so good, and so
confiding."But you are not here to sing her
praises."The working-man who yesterday found and brought back Frisky, came early
this morning and requested permission to speak with my young lady.""And is this working-man still in her house?"He came in when I was going out with the letter.""You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about.""Has your mistress seemed preoccupied, uneasy, or afraid of the interview
which she is to have to-day with the princess?She conceals so little of
what she thinks, that you ought to know."said the tire-woman, muttering between her teeth,
without Florine being able to hear her: "'They laugh most who laugh
last.'In spite of her audacious and diabolical character, she would
tremble, and would pray for mercy, if she knew what awaits her this day."Then addressing Florine, she continued-"Return, and keep yourself, I
advise you, from those fine scruples, which will be quite enough to do
you a bad turn."I cannot forget that I belong not to myself, madame."Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer
house, while Mrs Grivois went immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier.I cannot get anything out of those with whom he talks so
continually, but Lazaro tells me that--_Bien_, that he learns that Don
Mario suspects you of--of not belonging to the Church party."Don Mario's suspicions about him had been many and
varied, especially as La Libertad mine had not been discovered.He
said as much to Rosendo in reply; and as he did so, he thought the old
man's face took on a queer and unwonted expression."But, Padre," continued Rosendo at length, "they say that Don Mario
has word from the Bishop that you once wrote a book against the Holy
Father--"

"Good God!"The words burst from the priest's lips like the sudden
issuance of pent steam.Rosendo stared at him in bewilderment.it is what Lazaro tells me," replied the old man,
his own suspicion verging upon conviction.Jose's dark face became almost white, and his breath sobbed out in
gasps.A vague idea of the game Wenceslas was playing now stole
through his throbbing brain.That book, his Nemesis, his pursuing
Fate, had tracked him to this secluded corner of the earth, and in the
hands of the most unscrupulous politician of South America was being
used as a tool.But, precisely to what end, his wild thought did not
as yet disclose.Still, above the welter of it all, he saw clearly
that there must be no further delay on his part.Before he could
speak, however, Rosendo had resumed the conversation."Padre," he said, "had it occurred to you that you were watched, day
and night?"Don Mario's men keep you in sight during the day;
and at night there is always some one hovering near your house.You
could not escape now even if you would."Jose sank back in his chair limp and cold.His frenzied brain held but
one thought: he had delayed until too late--and the end was at hand!"Padre," said Rosendo earnestly, "tell me about that book.You have not brought Carmen up in the Church.But it was I who told
you not to--that her heart was her church, and it must not be
disturbed.But--is it true, as the people say, that you really belong
to the party that would destroy the Church?"While his heart burned within his breast,
he opened its portals and revealed to Rosendo all that lay within.Beginning with his boyhood, he drew his career out before the
wondering eyes of the old man down to the day when the culmination of
carnal ambition, false thought, perverted concepts of filial devotion
and sacredness of oath, of family honor and pride of race, had washed
him up against the dreary shores of Simiti.With no thought of
concealment, he exposed his ambition in regard to Carmen--even the
love for her that he knew must die of inanition--and ended by throwing
himself without reserve upon Rosendo's judgment.When the tense
recital was ended, Rosendo leaned over and clasped the priest's
trembling hand."I understand, Padre," he said gently."I am dull of wit, I know.And
you have often laughed at my superstitions and old family beliefs,
whether religious or otherwise.And I
shall die in the Church, and take my chances on the future, for I have
tried to live a good life.But--with a man like you--I understand.And
now, Padre, we have no time to be sorrowful.And both are
Carmen's, is it not so?Thanks be to the good Virgin," he muttered,
as he walked slowly away, "that Lazaro got those titles from Don Mario
to-day!"*       *       *       *       *

Nightfall brought an unexpected visitor in the person of Don Jorge,
who had returned from the remoter parts of the Guamoco region."_Bien_, and what news?"he called cheerily, as he strode into the
parish house, where Rosendo and Jose were in earnest conversation.Jose embraced him as a brother, while a great sense of relief stole
over him.Then he quickly made known to him the situation.He ceased his task of scraping the caked
mud from his bare limbs, and drew up a chair near Jose.But, _amigo_, lend
me a copy, for I doubt not it is most excellent reading, and will
serve to while away many a weary hour in the jungle."His eyes snapped
merrily, and he slapped Jose roundly upon the back when he finished
speaking."But," he continued more seriously, "things seem to be setting against
you, friend.However, let me but canvass the town to-morrow, and by
evening I can advise.And yet--and yet--I wonder why the Governor
sends arms here.Don Jorge needed not a full day to correctly estimate the situation in
Simiti.His bluff, hearty manner and genial good-nature constituted a
passport to every house, and by midday he had talked with nearly every
man in the _pueblo_.He called Jose and Rosendo for consultation
during the _siesta_."_Bien_," he said, when they were seated in the parish house, "Don
Mario without doubt descends from the very serpent that tempted our
mother Eve!He has become a person of considerable importance since
the Governor and Don Wenceslas strive with each other to rest their
authority and confidence in him.And, unless I mistake much, they have
him slated for important work.However that may be, the man already
has a large following.Moreover, he has them well poisoned against
you, _amigo_ Jose.They know more details about your book and your
life before coming to Simiti than do you._Bien_, you must counteract
the Alcalde's influence by a public statement.It must be to-night--in
the church!You will have to act quickly, for the old fox has you
picked for trouble!Diego's disappearance, you know; the girl, Carmen;
your rather foolish course here--it is all laid up against you,
friend, and you must meet it!"Don Jorge went out and summoned the town to a meeting
in the church that evening.Immediately Don Mario issued a mandate
forbidding a public gathering at a time of such stress.The people
began to assemble on the street corners and in front of their houses
to discuss the situation.Don Jorge was
everywhere, and none could talk so volubly nor gesticulate and
expectorate so vehemently as he.At sundown the people moved toward the _plaza_.Then the concourse
drifted slowly into the church.Don Jorge dragged Jose from the parish
house and up to the altar."You have got to divide them, Padre!""Your only hope now lies in the formation of your
own party to oppose the Alcalde!Talk to them as you never talked
before!Say all that you had stored up to say on Judgment Day!"Again, as Jose faced his little flock and saw them, bare of feet,
scantily clad in their simple cotton and calico, their faces set in
deep seriousness, the ludicrous side of the whole situation flashed
before him, and he almost laughed aloud at the spectacle which the
ancient, decayed town at that moment presented.These primitive
folk--they were but children, with all a child's simplicity of nature,
its petulance, its immaturity of view, and its sudden and unreasoning
acceptance of authority!He turned to the altar and took up a tall
brass crucifix.He held it out before him for a moment.Then he called
upon the Christ to witness to the truth of what he was about to say.Even Don Mario seemed to become calm
after that dramatic spectacle.He talked long and
earnestly.He knew not that such eloquence abode within him.His
declamation became more and more impassioned.He opened wide his heart
and called upon all present to look fearlessly within.Yes, he had
written the book in question.Yes, it had expressed his views at that time.The shadows were gathering
thick, and the smoking kerosene lamps battled vainly with the heavy
blackness.Mary journeyed to the kitchen.In a far corner of the room he saw Carmen and Ana.Rosendo
sat stolidly beside them.The sightless babe waved its tiny hands in
mute helplessness, while Dona Maria held it closely to her bosom.Carmen's last admonition sang in his ears.He must know--really
_know_--that the babe could see!His appeal to the people was not for himself.He cared not what
became of him.But Carmen--and now Ana and the blind babe--and the
calm, unimpassioned Dona Maria, the embodiment of all that was
greatest in feminine character--and Rosendo, waiting to lay down his
life for those he loved!And then, this people, soon, he felt, to be
shattered by the shock of war--ah, God above!what could he say that
might save them?If they could know, as Carmen did, if they could love
and trust as she did, would the hideous spectre of war ever stalk
among them?Could the world know, and love, and trust as did this fair
child, would it waste itself in useless wars, sink with famine and
pestilence, consume with the anguish of fear, and in the end bury its
blasted hopes in the dank, reeking tomb?The thought gave wings to his
voice, soul to his words.And, while the
holy hush remained upon the people, he descended the altar steps, his
frame still tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal, and went alone
to his house.CHAPTER 32


Dawn had scarcely reddened in the east when a number of men assembled
at Jose's door."You have turned the trick, _amigo_," said Don Jorge, rousing up from
his _petate_ on the floor beside the priest's bed."You have won over
a few of them, at least."Jose went out to meet the early callers."We come to say, Padre," announced Andres Arellano, the dignified
spokesman, "that we have confidence in your words of last night.We
suspect Don Mario, even though he has letters from the Bishop.We are
your men, and we would keep the war away from Simiti."There were five of them, strong of heart and brawny of arm."And there
will be more, Padre," added Andres, reading the priest's question in
his appraising glance.Thus was the town divided; and while many clung to the Alcalde, partly
through fear of offending the higher ecclesiastical authority, and
partly because of imagined benefits to be gained, others, and a goodly
number, assembled at Jose's side, and looked to him to lead them in
the crisis which all felt to be at hand.As the days passed, the
priest's following grew more numerous, until, after the lapse of a
week, the town stood fairly divided.Don Jorge announced his intention
of remaining in Simiti for the present.From the night of the meeting in the church excitement ran continuously
higher.Business was at length suspended; the fishermen forgot their
nets; and the limber tongues of the town gossips steadily increased
their clatter.Don Mario's store and _patio_ assumed the functions of
a departmental office.Daily he might be seen laboriously drafting
letters of incredible length and wearisome prolixity to acting-Bishop
Wenceslas; and nightly he was engaged in long colloquies and whispered
conferences with Don Luis and others of his followers and hangers-on.The government arms had been brought up from Bodega Central and stored
in an empty warehouse belonging to Don Felipe Alcozer to await further
disposition.But with the arrival of the arms, and of certain letters which Don
Mario received from Cartagena, the old town lost its calm of
centuries, not to recover it again for many a dreary day.By the time
its peace was finally restored, it had received a blow from which it
never recovered.And many a familiar face, too, had disappeared
forever from its narrow streets.Meanwhile, Jose and his followers anxiously awaited the turn of
events.It came at length, and in a manner not wholly unexpected.The
Alcalde in his voluminous correspondence with Wenceslas had not
failed to bring against Jose every charge which his unduly stimulated
brain could imagine.But in particular did he dwell upon the
priest's malign influence upon Carmen, whose physical beauty and
powers of mind were the marvel of Simiti.He hammered upon this
with an insistence that could not but at length again attract the
thought of the acting-Bishop, who wrote finally to Don Mario,
expressing the mildly couched opinion that, now that his attention
had been called again to the matter, Carmen should have the benefits
of the education and liberal training which a convent would afford.Don Mario's egotism soared to the sky.The great Bishop was actually
being advised by him!He would yet
remove to a larger town, perhaps Mompox, and, with the support of the
great ecclesiastic, stand for election to Congress!He would show the
Bishop what mettle he had in him.And first he would show
His Grace how a loyal servant could anticipate his master's wishes.He
summoned Fernando, and imperiously bade him bring the girl Carmen at
once.But Fernando returned, saying that Rosendo refused to give up the
child.But Fernando found it
impossible to execute the commission.Jose and Don Jorge stood with
Rosendo, and threatened to deal harshly with the constable should he
attempt to take Carmen by force.Fernando then sought to impress upon
the Alcalde the danger of arousing public opinion again over the
girl.Don Mario's wrath burst forth like an exploding bomb.He seized his
straw hat and his cane, the emblem of his office, and strode to the
house of Rosendo.His face grew more deeply purple as he went.At the
door of the house he encountered Jose and Don Jorge."Don Mario," began Jose, before the Alcalde could get his words
shaped, "it is useless.Be advised, Don Mario, for the consequences of
thoughtless action may be incalculable!"bellowed the irate official, "but, cow-face!do you know
that His Grace supports me?if you do not at once deliver to me your paramour--"

He got no further.Rosendo, who had been standing just within the
door, suddenly pushed Jose and Don Jorge aside and, stalking out, a
tower of flesh, confronted the raging Alcalde.For a moment he gazed
down into the pig-eyes of the man.Then, with a quick thrust of his
thick arm, he projected his huge fist squarely into Don Mario's
bloated face.Neither Jose nor Don Jorge, as they rushed in between Rosendo and his
fallen adversary, had any adequate idea of the consequences of the old
man's precipitate action.As they assisted the prostrate official to
his unsteady feet they knew not that to Rosendo, simple, peace-loving,
and great of heart, had fallen the lot to inaugurate hostilities in
the terrible anticlerical war which now for four dismal years was to
tear Colombia from end to end, and leave her prostrate and exhausted
at last, her sons decimated, her farms and industries ruined, and her
neck beneath the heavy heel of a military despot at Bogota, whose
pliant hand would still be guided by the astute brain of Rome.By the time the startled Alcalde had been set again upon his feet a
considerable concourse had gathered at the scene.Many stood in
wide-eyed horror at what had just occurred.The crowd rapidly grew, and in a few minutes the _plaza_
was full.Supporters of both sides declaimed and gesticulated
vehemently.In the heat of the arguments a blow was struck.The Alcalde, when he found his tongue, shrilly demanded the
arrest of Rosendo and his family, including the priest and Don Jorge.A dozen of his party rushed forward to execute the order.Rosendo had
slipped between Jose and Don Jorge and into his house.In a trice he
emerged with a great _machete_.His
eyes blazed like live coals, and his breath seemed to issue from his
dilating nostrils like clouds of steam.Don Jorge crept behind him and, gaining the house, collected
the terrified women and held them in readiness for flight.Juan,
Lazaro, and a number of others surrounded Jose and faced the angry
multitude.The strain was broken by the frenzied Alcalde, who rushed toward
Rosendo.The old man swung his enormous _machete_ with a swirl that,
had it met the official, would have clean decapitated him.But,
fortunately, one of the priest's supporters threw out his foot, and
the corpulent Alcalde fell heavily over it and bit the dust.The old man staggered with the shock and
gave way.Holding up both
hands high above his head, he sent out his voice clear and loud.The
blessed Virgin--"

"What know you of the blessed Virgin, priest of Satan?"shouted a
rough follower of the Alcalde.Julio Gomez stooped and took up a large piece of shale.He threw it
with all his force, just as the priest again strove to make his voice
heard above the din.The jagged
stone cut deeply, and the red blood spurted.Jose fell into the arms
of Lazaro and was dragged into the house.Then Rosendo, with a mad yell, plunged wildly into the crowd.A dozen
arms sought to hold him, but in vain.Julio saw the terrifying
apparition hurtling down upon him.He turned and fled, but not before
the great knife had caught him on its point as it swung down and
ripped a deep gash the full length of his naked back.Then the last vestige of reason fled from the mob, and chaos took the
reins.Back and forth through the _plaza_, in front of the church
where hung the image of the Prince of Peace, the maddened people
surged, fighting like demons, raining blows with clubs, fists, and
_machetes_, stabbing with their long, wicked knives, hurling sharp
stones, gouging, ripping, yelling, shrieking, calling upon Saints and
Virgin to curse their enemies and bless their blows.Over the heads of
them all towered the mighty frame of Rosendo.Back before his
murderous _machete_ fell the terrified combatants.His course among
them was that of a cannon ball.Dozens hung upon his arms, his
shoulders, or flung themselves about his great legs.His huge body,
slippery and reeking, was galvanized into energy incarnate.Sparks
seemed to flash from his eyes.Behind him, following in the swath which he cut, his supporters
crowded, fought and yelled.They cursed,
broke, and fled.Then Don Jorge, a man whose mortal strength was more
than common, threw himself upon the steaming, frenzied Rosendo and
stopped his mad progress.They are fleeing to the _bodega_
to get the rifles and ammunition!Come--_Dios arriba_!Cut, bruised, and dripping blood from a dozen wounds, Rosendo stood
for a moment blinking in confusion.A score lay on the ground about
him.Whether dead or wounded, he knew not, nor cared.The sight of Don
Mario's supporters in full flight fascinated him.It sounded like the gloating of an imp of Satan.Then the
force of Don Jorge's words smote him.cried Don Jorge, pulling him toward the
house.Those of the priest's other followers who were still whole
scattered wildly to their homes and barred their doors.There they
searched for knives, _machetes_, razors, any tool or instrument that
might be pressed into service as a weapon, and stood guard.One
frenzied fellow, the sole possessor of an antiquated shotgun,
projected the rusty arm from a hole in the wall of his mud hut and
blazed away down the deserted street indiscriminately and without
aim.Within the house Juan and Lazaro were supporting the dazed Jose, while
Dona Maria bathed and bound his wound.Carmen stood gazing upon the
scene in bewilderment.The precipitousness of the affair had taken her
breath away and driven all thought in mad rout from her mind.panted Don Jorge, "the church--it is the only place now
that is even fairly safe!Dona Maria, do you collect all the food in
the house!We know not how long we may be prisoners--"

"But--Don Jorge," interrupted Jose feebly, "they will attack us even
there!Let us flee--"

"Where, _amigo_?they would shoot us
down in cold blood!That
will hold some of them back, at any rate!And none of them, if they
get crazed with _anisado_!cried Rosendo, starting for the door, "but do you, Juan
and Lazaro, follow me with your _machetes_, and we will drive the
cowards from the _bodega_ and get the rifles ourselves!"By this time they have broken open the boxes
and loaded the guns.A shot--and it would be all over with you!But in
the church--you have a chance there!"Don Jorge seized his arm and dragged him out of the house and across
the deserted _plaza_.Juan and Lazaro helped Dona Maria gather what
food and water remained in the house; and together they hurried out
and over to the church.Swinging open the heavy wooden doors, they
entered and made them fast again.Then they sank upon the benches and
strove to realize their situation.Juan and Lazaro hurried to them and swung the wooden shutters.muttered Rosendo, seizing a bench and with one blow of
his _machete_ splitting it clean through, "these will make props to
hold them!"It was the work of but a few minutes to place benches across the thick
shutters and secure them with others placed diagonally against them
and let into the hard dirt floor.Then the little group huddled together and waited.Jose heard a sob
beside him, and a hand clutched his in the gloom.In
the excitement of the hour he had all but forgotten her.Through his
present confusion of thought a great fact loomed: as the girl clung to
him she was weeping!A low rumble drifted to them; a confusion of voices, growing louder;
and then a sharp report."They are coming, Padre," muttered Rosendo."And some one has tried
his rifle!"A moment later the ruck poured into the _plaza_ and made for Rosendo's
house.Don Mario, holding his cane aloft like a sword, was at their
head.Raging with disappointment at not finding the fugitives in the
house, they threw the furniture and kitchen utensils madly about,
punched great holes through the walls, and then rushed pellmell to the
parish house next door.A groan escaped Jose as he watched them
through a chink in the shutters.But as the howling mob streamed toward the parish house a wrinkled
old crone shrilled at them from across the way and pointed toward the
church."In there, _amigos_!"Shoot
them--they have hurt my Pedro!"Back like a huge wave the crowd flowed, and up against the church
doors.Don Mario, at the head of his valiant followers, held up his
hand for silence.Then, planting himself before the main doors of the
church, he loudly voiced his authority."In the name of the Government at Bogota!"he cried pompously, tapping
the doors with his light cane."Fernando," he
called, "run to my house and fetch the drum!"Despite the seriousness of their situation, Jose smiled at the
puppet-show being enacted without.The Alcalde reiterated his demands with truculent vanity."_Caramba!_ if I but had him in here alone!"Then, as no response came from within,
his anger began to soar."_Caramba!_" he cried, "but you defy the
law?"Angry mutterings rose from the crowd.A third intimated
that shooting them full of holes were better.This idea, once voiced,
spread like an infection.The childish people were eager to try the
rifles.The Alcalde threw himself heavily up against the doors."_Caramba!_"
he shrilled.Open!--or it will be the worse for you!"Jose decided that their silence should no longer exasperate the angry
man.He put his mouth to the crevice between the doors."Don Mario," he cried, "this is sacred ground!We may
settle this trouble amicably, if you will but listen to reason."The Alcalde jumped up and down in his towering wrath.he
screamed, "but I am the law--I am the Government!A curse upon you,
priest of Satan!"And if you attack us you attack the Church!"_Amigos!_ _Muchachos!_" he bawled, turning to
the mob, "we will batter down the doors!"Again and
again the mob hurled itself upon the thick doors.They bent, they
sagged, but they held.A torrent of
anathemas streamed from his thick lips.some one shouted, recovering a portion of his scant
wit."Aye--and the door of the _sacristia_!"Round the building streamed the crazed mob, without head, without
reason, lusting only for the lives of the frightened little band
huddled together in the gloom within.Ana bent sobbing over her tiny babe.Don Jorge and Rosendo remained
mute and grim.Jose knew that those two would cast a long reckoning
before they died.Juan and Lazaro went from door to window, steadying
the props and making sure that they were holding.The tough, hard,
tropical wood, though pierced in places by _comjejen_ ants, was
resisting.The sun was already high, and the _plaza_ had become a furnace.The
patience of the mob quickly evaporated in the ardent heat.Don Mario's
wits had gone completely.Revenge, mingled with insensate zeal to
manifest the authority which he believed his intercourse with
Wenceslas had greatly augmented, had driven all rationality from his
motives.Flaming anger had unseated his reason.Descending from the
platform on which stood the church, he blindly drew up his armed
followers and bade them fire upon the church doors.If Wenceslas, acting-Bishop by the grace of political machination,
could have witnessed the stirring drama then in progress in ancient
Simiti, he would have laughed aloud at the complete fulfillment of his
carefully wrought plans.The cunning of the shrewd, experienced
politician had never been more clearly manifested than in the carrying
out of the little program which he had set for the unwise Alcalde of
this almost unknown little town, whereby the hand of Congress should
be forced and the inevitable revolt inaugurated.Don Mario had seized
the government arms, the deposition of which in Simiti in his care had
constituted him more than ever the representative of federal
authority.But, in his wild zeal, he had fallen into the trap which
Wenceslas had carefully arranged for him, and now was engaged in a mad
attack upon the Church itself, upon ecclesiastical authority as vested
in the priest Jose.How could Wenceslas interpret this but as an
anticlerical uprising?And while
the soft-headed dupes and maniacal supporters of Don Mario were
hurling bullets into the thick doors of the old church in Simiti,
Wenceslas sat musing in his comfortable study in the cathedral of
Cartagena, waiting with what patience he could command for further
reports from Don Mario, whose last letter had informed him that the
arrest of the priest Jose and his unfortunate victim, Carmen, was only
a few hours off.When the first shots rang out, and the bullets ploughed into the hard
wood of the heavy doors, Jose's heart sank, and he gave himself up as
lost.Lazaro and Juan cowered upon the floor.Carmen crept close to
Jose, as he sat limply upon a bench, and put her arms about him."Padre dear," she whispered, "it isn't true--it isn't true!They don't
really want to kill us!The recriminating thought
flashed over him that he alone was the cause of this.He had
sacrificed them all--none but he was to blame.if he
could only offer himself to satiate the mob's lust, and save these
innocent ones!Lurid, condemnatory thoughts burned through his brain
like molten iron.Rosendo and
Don Jorge seized him as he was about to lift a prop."I am going out, friends--I shall give myself to them for you all.Let them have me, if they
will spare you!"But the firing had ceased, and Don Mario was approaching the door."Myself for the others, Don Mario!""But promise to spare them--but give me your word--and I
will yield myself to arrest!""It is not
you that the good Bishop wants, but the girl!I have his letters
demanding that I send her to him!If you will come out, you shall not
be hurt.Only, Rosendo must stand trial for the harm he did in the
fight this morning; and the girl must go to Cartagena.As for the rest
of you, you will be free."Juan and Lazaro," he said, "we will open a window quickly in
the rear of the church and let you out.It is not right that you
should die with us.And Don Jorge, too--"

"Stop there, _amigo!_" interrupted the latter in a voice as cold as
steel."My life has not the value of a white heron.Can I do better
than give it for a cause that I know to be right?Nay, man, I remain
with you.Let the lads go, if they will--"

Lazaro forced himself between Don Jorge and the priest."Padre," he
said quietly, "to you I owe what I am.The boy's eyes were fixed on
Carmen.He turned and gazed for a moment at a window, as if hesitating
between two decisions."Padre," he
said, though his voice trembled, "I, too, remain."The Alcalde received his answer with a burst of inarticulate rage.He
rushed back to his followers with his arms waving wildly._Compadres_, get
the poles and burst in the shutters._Caramba!_ it is the Government
they are defying!"A bullet pierced the wall and whizzed past Carmen.Jose seized the girl and drew her down under a bench.The startled
bats among the roof beams fluttered wildly about through the heavy
gloom.Frightened rats scurried around the altar.The rusty bell in
the tower cried out as if in protest against the sacrilege.Juan burst
into tears and crept beneath a bench."Padre," said Rosendo, "it is only a question of time when the doors
will fall._Bien_, let us place
the women back of the altar, while we men stand here at one side of
the doors, so that when they fall we may dash out and cut our way
through the crowd.If we throw ourselves suddenly upon them, we may
snatch away a rifle or two.Then Don Jorge and I, with the lads here,
may drive them back--perhaps beat them!But my first blow shall be for
Don Mario!I vow here that, if I escape this place, he shall not live
another hour!""Better so, Rosendo, than that they should take us alive.Do we leave her to fall into Don Mario's hands?"Rosendo's voice, low and cold, froze the marrow in the priest's bones."Padre, she will not fall into the Alcalde's hands."Rosendo, do you--"

A piercing cry checked him.Padre--!_" Lazaro had
collapsed upon the floor."Padre--I confess--pray for
me.He struggled to lay a hand upon his bleeding
breast."To the altar, _amigos_!"cried Don Jorge, ducking his head as a
bullet sang close to it.Seizing the expiring Lazaro, they hurriedly dragged him down the aisle
and took refuge back of the brick altar.The bullets, now piercing the
walls of the church with ease, whizzed about them.One struck the
pendant figure of the Christ, and it fell crashing to the floor.Rosendo stood in horror, as if he expected a miracle to follow this
act of sacrilege.prayed Jose, "only Thy hand can save us!""He will save us, Padre--He will!"cried Carmen, creeping closer to
him through the darkness."Padre," said Don Jorge hurriedly, "the Host--is it on the altar?""Then, when the doors fall, do you stand in front of the altar,
holding it aloft and calling on the people to stand back, lest the
hand of God strike them!""It is a chance--yes, a bare chance.They will
stop before it--or they will kill me!Carmen's
voice broke clear and piercing through the din.Jose struggled to free
himself from her."_Na_, Padre," interposed Rosendo, "it may be better so!Heavy poles and billets of wood had been
fetched, and blow after blow now fell upon every shutter and door.The
sharp spitting of the rifles tore the air, and bullets crashed through
the walls and windows.In the heavy shadows back of the altar Rosendo
and Don Jorge crouched over the sobbing women.Jose knew as he stretched out a hand through the darkness and touched
the cold face that the faithful spirit had fled.How soon his own
would follow he knew not, nor cared.Keeping close to the floor, he
crept out and around to the front of the altar.Reaching up, he
grasped the Sacred Host, and then stood upright, holding it out before
him.Carmen rose by his side and took his hand.Rosendo's hoarse whisper drifted across the silence like a wraith.He
crept out and along the floor, scarce daring to look up.Through the
darkness his straining eyes caught the outlines of the two figures
standing like statues before the altar."_Loado sea Dios!_" he cried, and his voice broke with a sob."But,
Padre, they have stopped--what has happened?"We are in the hands of God--"

"Padre--listen!"Carmen darted from the altar and ran to the door.All was quiet without, but for
an animated conversation between Don Mario and some strangers who had
evidently just arrived upon the scene.One of the latter was speaking
with the Alcalde in excellent Spanish.Another, evidently unacquainted
with the language, made frequent interruptions in the English tongue."Say, Reed," said the voice in English, "tell the parchment-faced old
buzzard that we appreciate the little comedy he has staged for us.Tell him it is bully-bueno, but he must not overdo it.We are plum
done up, and want a few days of rest.""What says the senor, _amigo_?"asked Don Mario, with his utmost
suavity and unction of manner."He says," returned the other in Spanish, "that he is delighted with
the firmness which you display in the administration of your office,
and that he trusts the bandits within the church may be speedily
executed."They are those who
defy the Government as represented by myself!"He straightened up and
threw out his chest with such an exhibition of importance that the
strangers with difficulty kept their faces straight.Carmen and Jose looked at each other in amazement during this
colloquy."Do all who speak English tell such
lies?"murmured the one addressed as Reed, directing himself to the
Alcalde, "how dared they!But, senor, my friend and I have come to
your beautiful city on business of the utmost importance, in which
you doubtless will share largely.I would suggest," looking with
amusement at the array of armed men about him, "that your prisoners
are in no immediate likelihood of escaping, and you might leave them
under close guard while we discuss our business.A--a--we hear
reports, senor, that there is likely to be trouble in the country, and
we are desirous of getting out as soon as possible."Cierto, senores!_" exclaimed Don Mario, bowing low.Turning to the gaping people, he selected
several to do guard duty, dismissed the others, and then bade the
strangers follow him to his house, which, he declared vehemently, was
theirs as long as they might honor him with their distinguished
presence.The sudden turn of events left the little group within the church in a
maze of bewilderment.They drew together in the center of the room and
talked in low whispers until the sun dropped behind the hills and
night drifted through the quiet streets.Late that evening came a
tapping at the rear door of the church, and a voice called softly to
the priest.Jose roused out of his gloomy revery and hastened to
answer it.I am on guard; but no one must know that I
talk with you.But--Padre, if you open the door and escape, I will not
see you.I am sorry, Padre, but it could not be helped.Don Mario has
us all frightened, for the Bishop--"

"True, _amigo_," returned Jose; "but the strangers who arrived this
afternoon--who are they, and whence?""Two _Americanos_, Padre, and miners.""Fernando--you would aid me?_Bien_, get word
to the stranger who speaks both English and Spanish.Bring him here,
secretly, and stand guard yourself while I talk with him.""Gladly, Padre," returned the penitent fellow, as he hastened quietly
away.An hour later Jose was again roused by Fernando tapping on the door.Fear not; only the _Americano_ will enter.Jose lifted the prop and swung the door open.Rosendo stood with
uplifted _machete_.Jose
quickly closed the door, and then addressed him in English.exclaimed the stranger in a mellow voice."I had no
idea I should find any one in this God-forsaken town who could speak
real United States!"Jose drew him into the _sacristia_.Neither man could see the other in
the dense blackness."Tell me, friend," began Jose, "who you are, and where you come
from.""Reed--Charles Reed--New York--mining engineer--down here to examine
the so-called mines of the Molino Company, now gasping its last while
awaiting our report.Arrived this afternoon from Badillo with my
partner, fellow named Harris.you certainly
were in a stew when we appeared!Even if we passed the guard, where would we
go?There are two women, a girl, and a babe with us.Should we gain the Boque or Guamoco trail, we would
be pursued and shot down.There is a chance here--none in flight!Reed," continued Jose earnestly, "will you get word from
me to the Bishop in Cartagena that our church has been attacked--that
its priest is besieged by the Alcalde, and his life in jeopardy?"Your _bogas_
have not returned to Badillo?""No, they are staying here for the big show.Execution of the
traitors, you know.""Then, friend, send them at dawn to Bodega Central.Let them take a
message to be sent by the telegraph from that place.Tell the
Bishop--"

"Sure!"I'll fix up a message
that will bring him by return boat!I've been talking with the
Honorable Alcalde and I've got his exact number.Say, he certainly is
the biggest damn--beg pardon; I mean, the biggest numbskull I have
ever run across--and that's saying considerable for a mining man!"said Jose, making no other reply to the man's words."Go
quickly--and use what influence you have with the Alcalde to save us.We have women here--and a young girl!"He found the American's hand
and led him out into the night.*       *       *       *       *

Wenceslas Ortiz stood before the Departmental Governor.His face was
deeply serious, and his demeanor expressed the utmost gravity.In his
hand he held a despatch.The Governor sat at his desk, nervously
fumbling a pen."_Bien, Senor_," said Wenceslas quietly, "do you act--or shall I take
it to His Excellency, the President?"The Governor moved uneasily in his chair."_Caramba!_" he blurted out.And yet, I cannot see but that the Alcalde
acted wholly within his rights!""Your Excellency, he seizes government arms--he attacks the church--he
attempts to destroy the life of its priest.Nominally acting for the
Government; at heart, anticlerical.Will the
Government clear itself now of the suspicion which this has aroused?""But the priest--did you not say only last week that he himself had
published a book violently anticlerical in tone?""Senor, we will not discuss the matter further," said Wenceslas,
moving toward the door."Your final decision--you will send troops to
Simiti, or no?"Wenceslas courteously bowed himself out.Once beyond the door, he
breathed a great sigh of relief."_Santa Virgen!_" he muttered, "but I
took a chance!Had he yielded and sent troops, all would have been
spoiled.He entered his carriage and was driven hurriedly to his _sanctum_.There he despatched a long message to the President of the Republic.He mused over it for the space of an hour."Your Excellency," it read, "the
Church supports the Administration."Late that evening a second message from Bogota was put into his hand.He tore it open and read, "The Hercules ordered to Simiti.""Ah," he sighed, sinking into his chair.A message to
the captain of the Hercules to bring me that girl!"*       *       *       *       *

"Well, old man, I've done all I could to stave off the blundering
idiot; but I guess you are in for it!The jig is up, I'm thinking!"Simiti again slept, while the American and Jose
in the _sacristia_ talked long and earnestly.Fernando kept guard at
the door."Your message went down the river two days ago," continued Reed.since then I've racked my dusty brain for topics to keep
the Alcalde occupied and forgetful of you.But I'm dryer than a desert
now; and he vows that to-morrow you and your friends will be dragged
out of this old shack by your necks, and then shot."The two days had been filled with exquisite torture for Jose.Only the
presence of Carmen restrained him from rushing out and ending it all.Every hour, every moment, she
knew only the immanence of her God; whereas he, obedient to the
undulating Rincon character-curve, expressed the mutability of his
faith in hourly alternations of optimism and black despair.After
periods of exalted hope, stimulated by the girl's sublime confidence,
there would come the inevitable backward rush of all the chilling
fear, despondency, and false thought which he had just expelled in
vain, and he would be left again floundering helplessly in the dismal
labyrinth of terrifying doubts.The quiet which enwrapped them during these days of imprisonment; the
gloom-shrouded church; the awed hush that lay upon them in the
presence of the dead Lazaro, stimulated the feeble and sensitive
spirit of the priest to an unwonted degree of introspection, and he
sat for hours gazing blankly into the ghastly emptiness of his past.He saw how at the first, when Carmen entered his life with the
stimulus of her buoyant faith, there had seemed to follow an emptying
of self, a quick clearing of his mentality, and a replacement of much
of the morbid thought, which clung limpet-like to his mentality, by
new and wonderfully illuminating ideas.For a while he had seemed to
be on the road to salvation; he felt that he had touched the robe of
the Christ, and heavenly virtue had entered into his being.But then the shadows began to gather once more.He did not cling to
the new truths and spiritual ideas tenaciously enough to work them out
in demonstration.He had proved shallow soil, whereon the seed had
fallen, only to be choked by the weeds which grew apace therein.The
troubles which clustered thick about him after his first few months in
Simiti had seemed to hamper his freer limbs, and check his upward
progress.Constant conflict with Diego, with Don Mario, and Wenceslas;
the pressure from his mother and his uncle, had kept him looking, now
at evil, now at good, giving life and power to each in turn, and
wrestling incessantly with the false concepts which his own mentality
kept ever alive.Worrying himself free from one set of human beliefs,
he fell again into the meshes of others.Though he thought he knew the
truth--though he saw it lived and demonstrated by Carmen--he had yet
been afraid to throw himself unreservedly upon his convictions.And so
he daily paid the dire penalty which error failed not to exact.But Carmen, the object of by far the greater part of all his anxious
thought, had moved as if in response to a beckoning hand that remained
invisible to him.And each
day, too, she had seemed to draw farther away from him, as she
rose steadily out of the limited encompassment in which they
dwelt.Not by conscious design did she appear to separate from him,
but inevitably, because of his own narrow capacity for true
spiritual intercourse with such a soul as hers.He shared her
ideals; he had sought in his way to attain them; he had striven,
too, to comprehend her spirit, which in his heart he knew to be a
bright reflection of the infinite Spirit which is God.But as the
years passed he had found his efforts to be like her more and more
clumsy and blundering, and his responses to her spiritual demands less
and less vigorous.At times he seemed to catch glimpses of her
soul that awed him.At others he would feel himself half inclined
to share the people's belief that she was possessed of powers
occult.And then he would sink into despair of ever understanding the
girl--for he knew that to do so he must be like her, even as to
understand God we must become like Him.After her fourteenth birthday Jose found himself rapidly ceasing to
regard Carmen as a mere child.Not that she did not still often
seem delightfully immature, when her spirits would flow wildly, and
she would draw him into the frolics which had yielded her such
extravagant joy in former days; but that the growth of knowledge and
the rapid development of her thought had seemed to bring to her a
deepening sense of responsibility, a growing impression of maturity,
and an increasing regard for the meaning of life and her part in
it.She had ceased to insist that she would never leave Simiti.And
Jose often thought of late, as he watched her, that he detected
signs of irksomeness at the limitations which her environment
imposed upon her.But, if so, these were never openly expressed; nor
did her manner ever change toward her foster-parents, or toward the
simple and uncomprehending folk of her native town.From the first, Jose had constituted himself her teacher, guide, and
protector.His soured and
rebellious nature had been no barrier to her great love, which had
twined about his heart like ivy around a crumbling tower.And his love
for the child had swelled like a torrent, fed hourly by countless
uncharted streams.He had watched over her like a father; he had
rejoiced to see her bloom into a beauty as rich and luxuriant as the
tropical foliage; he had gazed for hours into the unsearchable abyss
of her black eyes and read there, in ecstasy, a wondrous response to
his love; and when, but a few short days ago, she had again intimated
a future union, a union upon which, even as a child, she had insisted,
yet one which he knew--had always known--utterly, extravagantly
impossible--he had, nevertheless, seized upon the thought with a joy
that was passionate, desperate--and had then flung it from him with a
cry of agony.It was not the disparity of ages; it was not the girl's
present immaturity.In less than a year she would have attained the
marriageable age of these Latin countries.But he could wait two,
three, aye, ten years for such a divine gift!No; the shadow which lay
upon his life was cast by the huge presence of the master whose chains
he wore, the iron links of which, galling his soul, he knew to be
unbreakable.And, as he sat in the gloom of the decayed old church
where he was now a prisoner, the thought that his situation but
symbolized an imprisonment in bonds eternal roused him to a
half-frenzied resolve to destroy himself."Padre dear," the girl had whispered to him that night, just before
the American came again with his disquieting report, "Love will open
the door--Love will set us free.Remember, Paul
thanked God for freedom even while he sat in chains.And I am just as
thankful as he."Jose knew as he kissed her tenderly and bade her go to her place of
rest on the bench beside Dona Maria that death stood between her and
the stained hand of Wenceslas Ortiz.As morning reddened in the eastern sky Don Mario, surrounded by an
armed guard and preceded by his secretary, who beat lustily upon a
small drum, marched pompously down the main street and across the
_plaza_ to the church.Holding his cane aloft he ascended the steps of
the platform and again loudly demanded the surrender of the prisoners
within."The same," reiterated the Alcalde vigorously."Then we will die, Don Mario," he replied sadly, moving
away from the door and leading his little band of harried followers to
the rear of the altar.The Alcalde quickly descended the steps and shouted numerous orders.Several of his men hurried off in various directions, while those
remaining at once opened fire upon the church.In a few moments the
firing was increased, and the entire attack was concentrated upon the
front doors.Shouts and curses filled the morning
air.But it was evident to Jose that his besiegers were meeting with
no opposition from his own supporters in the fight of two days before.The sight of the deadly rifles in the hands of Don Mario's party had
quickly quenched their loyalty to Jose, and led them basely to abandon
him and his companions to their fate.After a few minutes of vigorous assault the attack abruptly ceased,
and Jose was called again to the door."It's Reed," came the American's voice."I've
persuaded the old carrion to let me have a moment's pow-wow with you.Say, give the old buzzard what he wants.Otherwise it's sure death for
you all.I've argued myself sick with him, but he's as set as
concrete.I'll do what I can for you if you come out; but he's going
to have the girl, whether or no.Seems that the Bishop of Cartagena
wants her; and the old crow here is playing politics with him.""Yes, old man," chimed in another voice, which Jose knew to be that of
Harris."You know these fellows are hell on politics."Then to Jose, "What'll I tell the old
duffer?"ejaculated Harris, "if I had a couple of Mausers I could
put these ancient Springfields on the bum in a hurry!""Tell him, friend, that we are prepared to die," replied Jose
drearily, as he turned back into the gloom and took Carmen's hand.The final assault began, and Jose knew that it was only a question of
minutes when the trembling doors would fall.He crouched with his
companions behind the altar, awaiting the inevitable."Love will save us, Padre," she whispered.They don't know what is using them--and it has no power!Rosendo bent over and whispered to Don Jorge, "When the doors fall and
the men rush in, stand you here with me!When they reach the altar we
will throw ourselves upon them, I first, you following, while Juan
will bring Carmen and try to protect her.With our _machetes_ we will
cut our way out.If we find that it is hopeless--then give me
Carmen!"A moment later, as with a loud wail, the two front doors burst asunder
and fell crashing to the floor.A flood of golden sunlight poured into
the dark room.In its yellow wake rushed the mob, with exultant yells.Rosendo rose quickly and placed himself at the head of his little
band.But, ere the first of the frenzied besiegers had crossed the threshold
of the church, a loud cry arose in the _plaza_.Down the main thoroughfare came a volley of shots.Don Mario, half way
through the church door, froze in his tracks.Those of his followers
who had entered, turned quickly and made pellmell for the exit.Their
startled gaze met a company of federal troops rushing down the street,
firing as they came.But the doors were prone upon the floor,
and could not be replaced.Then he and his men scrambled out and
rushed around to one side of the building.As the soldiers came
running up, the Alcalde's followers fired point blank into their
faces, then dropped their guns and fled precipitately.Within an hour staid old Simiti lay in the
grip of martial law, with its once overweening Alcalde, now a meek and
frightened prisoner, arraigned before Captain Morales, holding court
in the shabby town hall.But the court-martial was wholly perfunctory.Though none there but
himself knew it, the captain had come with the disposal of the
unfortunate Don Mario prearranged.A perfunctory hearing of witnesses,
which but increased his approval of his orders, and he pronounced
sentence upon the former Alcalde, and closed the case."Attack upon the church--Assassination of the man Lazaro--Firing upon
federal soldiers--To be shot at sunset, senor," he concluded
solemnly.I was ordered by him to do
it!""_Bien_, senor," replied the captain, whose heart was not wholly
devoid of pity, "produce your letters.""_Senor Capitan_," interposed Jose, "may I plead for the man?He
is--"

"There, Padre," returned the captain, holding up a hand, "it is
useless.Doubtless this has been brought about by motives which you do
not understand.You have a _carcel_
here?_Bien_," addressing his lieutenant, "remove the prisoner to it,
and at sunset let the sentence be carried out."Don Mario, screaming with fear, was dragged from the room."And now, senores," continued the captain calmly, as if nothing out of
the ordinary had occurred, "I appoint Don Fernando, former secretary,
as temporary Alcalde, until such time as the Governor may fill the
office permanently.And," he continued, looking about the room with a
heavy scowl, while the timid people shrank against the wall, "as for
those misguided ones who took part with Don Mario in this anticlerical
uprising--his fate will serve, I think, as a warning!"A hush of horror lay upon the stunned people as they filed slowly out
of the room."_Bien_," added the captain, addressing Fernando, "quarters for my
men, and rations.And let all
arms and ammunition be collected.And we
shall want _peones_ to carry it to the river."Jose turned away, sick with the horror of it all.A soldier approached
him with a message from Don Mario.The condemned man was asking for
the last rites.Faint and trembling, the priest accompanied the
messenger to the jail.wailed the terrified and bewildered Don Mario.Don Wenceslas--"

"Yes, I understand, Don Mario," interrupted Jose, tenderly taking the
man's hand."Yes, Padre," sobbed the unfortunate victim."He said that I would be
rich--that I would be elected to Congress--ah, the traitor!And,
Padre--I burned his letters because it was his wish!Ah, _Santa
Virgen_!"He put his head on the priest's shoulder and wept
violently.Jose's heart was wrung; but he was powerless to aid the man.And yet,
as he dwelt momentarily on his own sorrows, he almost envied the fate
which had overtaken the misguided Don Mario."_Senor Padre_," he said, "the sun is low.In
a quarter of an hour--"

Don Mario sank to the ground and clasped the priest's knees.Jose held
up his hand, and the lieutenant, bowing courteously, withdrew.The
priest knelt beside the cowering prisoner."Don Mario," he said gently, holding the man's hand, "confess all to
me.It may be the means of saving other lives--and then you will have
expiated your own crimes.""Padre," moaned the stricken man, rocking back and forth, his head
buried in his hands and tears streaming through his fingers, "Padre,
you will forgive--?"But remove now the last burden from your soul--the guilty
knowledge of the part Don Wenceslas has had in the disaster which has
come upon Simiti.Tell it all, friend, for you may save many precious
lives thereby."The fallen Alcalde roused himself by a mighty effort.Forgetting for
the moment his own dire predicament, he opened his heart.Jose sat
before him in wide-mouthed astonishment.Don Mario's confession
brought a revelation that left him cold.Then, to Don Mario: "And Carmen?"Don Mario leaned close to the priest and whispered low."No, she is
not Diego's child!And, Padre, take her away, at once!There is not an inch of ground in all Colombia now where she
would be safe from Don Wenceslas!"Then he again took Don Mario's
hand."Friend," he said gravely, "rest assured, what you have told me saves
at least one life, and removes the sin with which your own was
stained.And now," rising and turning to the waiting lieutenant, "we
are ready."Santa Virgen, San Salvador, ora pro
nobis!_

A few minutes later a sharp report echoed through the Simiti valley
and startled the herons that were seeking their night's rest on the
wooded isle.Then Jose de Rincon, alone, and with a heart of lead,
moved slowly down through the dreary village and crossed the deserted
_plaza_ to his lowly abode.CHAPTER 34


The low-hung moon, shrouded in heavy vapor, threw an eldritch shimmer
upon the little group that silently bore the body of the martyred
Lazaro from the old church late that night to the dreary cemetery on
the hill.Jose took but a reluctant part in the proceedings.He would
even have avoided this last service to his faithful friend if he
could.It seemed to him as he stumbled along the stony road behind the
body which Rosendo and Don Jorge carried that his human endurance had
been strained so far beyond the elastic limit that there could now be
no rebound.Every thought that touched his sore mind made it bleed
anew, for every thought that he accepted was acrid, rasping,
oppressive.The sheer weight of foreboding, of wild apprehension, of
paralyzing fear, crushed him, until his shoulders bent low as he
walked.How, lest he perform a miracle, could he hope to extricate
himself and his loved ones from the meshes of the net, far-cast, but
with unerring aim, which had fallen upon them?As he passed the town hall he saw through the open door the captain's
cot, and a guard standing motionless beside it.The captain had
elected to remain there for the night, while his men found a prickly
hospitality among the cowering townsfolk.Jose knew now that the hand
which Don Mario had dealt himself in the game inaugurated by Wenceslas
had been from a stacked deck.He knew that the President of the
Republic had ordered Morales to this inoffensive little town to quell
an alleged anticlerical uprising, and that the execution of the
misguided Alcalde had been determined long before the Hercules had got
under way.He could see that it was necessary for the Government to
sacrifice its agent in the person of the Alcalde, in order to prove
its own loyalty to the Church.And in return therefor he knew it would
expect, not without reason, the cooeperation of the Church in case the
President's interference in the province of Bolivar should precipitate
a general revolt.But what had been determined upon as his own fate?He had not the
semblance of an idea.From the confession of the ruined Alcalde he now
knew that Don Mario had been poisoned against him from the beginning;
that even the letters of introduction which Wenceslas had given him to
the Alcalde contained the charge of his having accomplished the ruin
of the girl Maria in Cartagena, and of his previous incarceration in
the monastery of Palazzola.And Don Mario had confessed in his last
moments that Wenceslas had sought to work through him and Jose in the
hope that the location of the famous mine, La Libertad, might be
revealed.Don Mario had been instructed to get what he could out of
this scion of Rincon; and only his own greed and cupidity had caused
him to play fast and loose with both sides until, falling before the
allurements which Wenceslas held out, he had rushed madly into his own
destruction.Jose realized that so far he himself had proved extremely
useful to Wenceslas--but had his usefulness ended?At these thoughts
his soul momentarily suffused with the pride of the old and hectoring
Rincon stock and rose, instinct with revolt--but only to sink again in
helpless resignation, while the shadow of despair rolled in and
quenched his feeble determination.Rosendo and Don Jorge placed the body in one of the vacant vaults and
filled the entrance with some loose bricks.He had a part to perform,
out there on the bleak hilltop in the ghostly light.But Jose remained
motionless and silent, his head sunk upon his breast.Then Rosendo, waxing troubled, spoke in gentle admonition."He would
expect it, you know, Padre."Bitter tears coursed down his
cheeks, and his voice broke.He laid his head on Rosendo's stalwart
shoulder and wept aloud.The sickly, greenish cast of the moonlight silhouetted the figures of
the three men in grotesque shapes against the cemetery wall and the
crumbling tombs.The morose call of a toucan floated weirdly upon the
heavy air.The faint wail of the frogs in the shallow waters below
rose like the despairing sighs of lost souls.Rosendo wound his long arm about the sorrowing priest.Don Jorge's
muscles knotted, and a muttered imprecation rose from his tight lips.Strangely had the shift and coil of the human mind thrown together
these three men, so different in character, yet standing now in united
protest against the misery which men heap upon their fellow-men in the
name of Christ.Jose, the apostate agent of Holy Church, his hands
bound, and his heart bursting with yearning toward his fellow-men;
Rosendo, simple-minded and faithful, chained to the Church by heredity
and association, yet ashamed of its abuses and lusts; Don Jorge,
fierce in his denunciation of the political and religious sham and
hypocrisy which he saw masking behind the cloak of imperial religion."I have nothing to say, friends," moaned Jose, raising his head;
"nothing that would not still further reveal my own miserable weakness
and the despicable falsity of the Church.If the Church had followed
the Christ, it would have taught me to do likewise; and I should now
call to Lazaro and bid him come forth, instead of shamefully
confessing my impotency and utter lack of spirituality, even while I
pose as an _Alter Christus_.""You--you will leave a blessing with him before we go, Padre?"queried
the anxious Rosendo, clinging still to the frayed edge of his fathers'
faith."My blessing, Rosendo," replied Jose sadly, "would do no good.He lies
there because we have utterly forgotten what the Master came to teach.He lies there because of our false, undemonstrable, mortal beliefs.Oh, that the Church, instead of wasting time murmuring futile prayers
over dead bodies, had striven to learn to do the deeds which the
Christ said we should all do if we but kept his commandments!""But, Padre, you will say Masses for him?"I would not take his or your money to
give to the Church to get his soul out of an imagined purgatory which
the Church long ago invented for the purpose of enriching herself
materially--for, alas!after spiritual riches she has had little
hankering.""To pay God to get His own children out of the flames, eh?""It is what I have always said, the religion of the Church
is a _religion de dinero_.If there ever was a God, either He is still
laughing Himself sick at our follies--or else He has wept Himself to
death over them!"Friend," said Jose solemnly, turning to Don Jorge, "I long since
learned what the whole world must learn some time, that the Church
stands to-day, not as the bride of the Christ, but as the incarnation
of the human mind, as error opposed to Truth.It is the embodiment of
'Who shall be greatest?'It is one of the various phenomena of the
human mentality; and its adherents are the victims of authoritative
falsehood.Its Mass and countless other ceremonies differ in no
essential respect from ancient pagan worship.And so it can do none of the works of the Master.Its corrupting
faith is foully materialistic.And as the human mind expands, the incoming light must drive out the
black beliefs and deeds of Holy Church, else the oncoming centuries
will have no place for it.""But why do you still remain a
priest?I knew when I saw you on the river boat that you
were none.But," his voice dropping to a whisper, "there is a soldier
in the road below.He might think we were
here to plot."When the soldier had passed, they quietly left the gloomy cemetery and
made their way quickly back through the straggling moonlight to
Rosendo's house.Dona Maria, with characteristic quietude, was
preparing for the duties of the approaching day.Jose went to her bedside and bent over her, wondering.What were the
events of the past few days in her sight?What did Lazaro's death and the
execution of Don Mario mean to her?Did she, as he had done, look upon
them as real events in a real world, created and governed by a good
God?Or did she still hold such things to be the unreal phenomena of
the human mentality?--unreal, because opposed to God, and without the
infinite principle.As for himself, how had the current of his life
been diverted by this rare child!What had she not sought to teach him
by her simple faith, her unshaken trust in the immanence of good!True, as a pure reflection of good she had seemed to be the means of
stirring up tremendous evil.But had he not seen the evil eventually
consume itself, leaving her unscathed?He himself had always conceded to the forces of evil as great power as
to those of good--nay, even greater.And even now as he stood looking
at her, wrapped in peaceful slumber, his strained sight caught no
gleam of hope, no light flashing through the heavy clouds of
misfortune that lowered above her.He turned away with an anxious
sigh."Padre," said the gentle Dona Maria, "the two _Americanos_--"

"Ah, yes," interrupted Jose, suddenly remembering that he had sent
word to them to use his house while they remained in the town."They brought their baggage to your house an hour ago and set up their
beds in your living room."Good," he replied, a wistful sense of gratitude stealing over him at
the reassuring thought of their presence."_Bien_, we will not disturb
them."Summoning Rosendo and Don Jorge, the three men sought the lake's edge.There, seated on the loose shales, they wrestled with their problem
until dawn spread her filmy veil over the shimmering stars.*       *       *       *       *

Long before sun-up the soldiers and the _peones_, whom Captain Morales
had impressed, were busy gathering the commandeered rifles and
carrying them down to the gunboat Hercules, waiting at the mouth of
the Boque river, some six or eight miles distant, and over a wild
trail.The townsfolk, thoroughly frightened, hugged the shelter of
their homes, and left the streets to the troops.Though they detested
the soldiers, yet none would lightly risk a blow from the heavy hand
of Morales, whose authority on a punitive expedition of this sort was
unlimited.The summary execution of the Alcalde had stricken them with
horror, and left an impression which never would be erased from their
memories.Immediately after the early _desayuno_ the captain appeared at
Rosendo's door.He had come to say farewell to the priest.All of the
soldiers had disappeared down the trail, with the exception of the two
who formed the captain's small personal escort."_Conque, adios, Senor Padre_" he called cheerily, as he approached.Jose was sitting at table with Rosendo's family and Don Jorge.Instinctively he rose hastily, and seizing Carmen, thrust her into the
adjoining bedroom and closed the door.Then he went out to face the
captain."Much excitement for your little _pueblo_, no?"exclaimed the captain
with a bluff laugh as he grasped Jose's hand."But a lesson like this
will last a century.I rejoice that I found it unnecessary to burn the
town.""_Senor Capitan_, I, too, rejoice.But--the state of the country--what may we expect?""_Caramba, Padre mio_!There
is much talk, many angry looks, much gesturing and waving of hands.The President sees fit to send me here, without
order from the Departmental Governor.He shrugged his shoulders with that expressive Latin
gesture which indicates complete irresponsibility for and indifference
to results."_Bueno pues, Senor Capitan_,"
he said hurriedly."I wish you every felicitation on your return trip.Ah--ah--your orders contained no reference to--to me?""None whatever, _Senor Padre_," replied the captain genially.He
turned to go, and Jose stifled a great sigh of relief.But suddenly
the captain stopped; then turned again.He fumbled in an inner pocket and drew forth a telegraphic document."_And you will seize the person of one Rosendo Ariza's daughter and
immediately send her with proper conveyance to the Sister Superior of
the convent of Our Lady in Cartagena_," he read aloud.From within Rosendo's house came a soft,
scurrying sound.Morales returned
the folded message to his pocket and started to enter the house.He was rendered suddenly inert, although
vividly conscious of a drama about to be enacted in which he and his
loved ones would play leading _roles_.As in a dream he heard the
captain address Rosendo and gruffly demand that he produce his
daughter.He heard a deep curse from Rosendo; and his blood congealed
more thickly as he dwelt momentarily on the old man's possible conduct
in the face of the federal demand.He heard Morales hunting
impatiently through the shabby rooms.Then he saw him emerge in a
towering rage--but empty-handed.cried the angry captain, "but what is this?Have
they not had one good lesson, that I must inflict another?I demand to
know, has this Rosendo Ariza a daughter?"He stood waiting for the answer that Jose knew he must make.The
priest's hollow voice sounded like an echo from another world."_Bien_, then I have discovered one honest man in yourself, Padre.You
will now assist me in finding her.""I--I know not--where--where she is, _Senor Capitan_," murmured Jose
with feebly fluttering lips.They were alone, this little party of actors, although many an eye
peered out timidly at them from behind closed shutters and barred
doors around the _plaza_.Don Jorge and Rosendo came out of the house
and stood behind Jose.The captain confronted them, bristling with
wrath at the insolence that dared oppose his supreme authority.The
heat had already begun to pour down in torrents.The morning air was
light, but not a sound traversed it.The principals in this tense
drama might have been painted against that vivid tropical background.Then Harris, moved by his piquant Yankee curiosity, appeared at the
door of the parish house, his great eyes protruding and his head
craned forth like a monster heron."Perhaps the _Americano_ hides the daughter of Ariza!"But ere he reached it Reed suddenly
appeared from behind Harris.In his hand he grasped a large American
flag.Holding this high above his head, he blocked the entrance."We are
American citizens, and this house is under the protection of the
American Government!"Morales fell back and stood with mouth agape in astonishment.The
audacity of this foreign adventurer fairly robbed him of his breath.He glanced dubiously from him to the priest.Then, to save the
situation, he broke into an embarrassed laugh."_Bien_, my good friend," he finally said, addressing Reed in his
courtliest manner, "all respect to your excellent Government.And, if
you will accept it, I shall be pleased to secure you a commission in
the Colombian army.But, my orders--you understand, do you not?The
sun is already high, and I can not lose more time.Therefore, you will
kindly stand aside and permit me to search that house."He motioned to
his men and moved forward.Still holding aloft the flag, Reed drew a long revolver.Harris
quickly produced one of equal size and wicked appearance.Morales
stopped abruptly and looked at them in hesitation.His chief delight
when not in the field was the perusal of a battered history of the
American Civil War; and his exclamations of admiration for the
hardihood of those who participated in it were always loud and
frequent.But he, too, had a reputation to sustain.The Americans
stood grimly silent before him.Harris's finger twitched nervously
along the trigger, and a smile played over his thin lips.Then, his face flaming with shame and chagrin, Morales turned to his
escort and commanded them to advance.A moment more, and--

A cry came from Rosendo's house.Ana, her face swollen with weeping,
clasping her sightless babe to her bosom, had emerged and faced the
captain."Senor," she said in a voice strained to a whisper, "I am the daughter
of Rosendo Ariza."A half-suppressed exclamation burst from the lips of Rosendo.A
desperate, suffocating joy surged over the riven soul of the priest.Don Jorge's mouth opened, but no sound came forth.This precipitate
_denouement_ held them rigid with astonishment.In the eyes of Jose Ana's
tense figure, standing grim and rigid before the captain, took on a
dignity that was majestic, a worth that transcended all human
computation.A Magdalen, yes, standing with her sin-conceived child
clasped in her trembling arms.this
sacrificial act broke the alabaster box and spread the precious nard
over the feet of the pitying Christ."It is," murmured the dazed priest, scarce hearing his own words."But--I have no orders respecting a child--"

"They cannot be separated," half whispered Jose, not daring to meet
the vacant gaze of the babe.Then, with an upward glance at
the sun, he gave a sharp command to his men.Placing the woman between
them, the two soldiers faced about and moved quickly away.With a low
bow and a final "_Adios, Senores_," the captain hurriedly joined them.Ere the little group before Rosendo's house had collected their wits,
the soldiers and their frail charge had mounted the hill beyond the
old church and disappeared into the matted trail that led from it to
the distant river.Rosendo was the first to break the mesmeric silence.His knees gave way beneath him and he buried his face in his
hands.Then he rose hastily, and made as if to pursue the soldiers.cried Don Jorge, "but it is the hand of Providence!Listen, friend Rosendo, it but gives us time to act!When the mistake is discovered they will return,
and they will bring her back unharmed--though they may not learn until
she reaches Cartagena!_Bien_, we can not waste time in mourning now!Rosendo strove to unravel his tangled wits.Jose went to him and
clasped his big hand."Rosendo--friend--would you have it different?I--I alone am to blame
that they took Anita!But--it was to save--to save--Ah, God!if I did
wrong, take the American's revolver and shoot me!"He tore open his
cassock and stood rigid before the dazed man.Anguish and soul-torture
had warped his features."We
shall find plenty of others more deserving of shooting, I think!Reed turned back into the parish house, and emerged a moment later
with Carmen and Dona Maria, who knew not as yet of Ana's departure."I
hid them in your bedroom, Padre," Reed explained."Dona Maria," he cried, "do you
take Carmen into your house and await our decision!And you, men, go
into my study!It is as Don Jorge says, we must act quickly!It may serve to protect us further
against the angry people of Simiti!"The five men quickly gathered in Jose's living room in a strained,
excited group.Rapidly he related
in detail Don Mario's last confession.When he had closed, Reed made
reply."Old man," he said, familiarly addressing Jose, "having seen the girl,
I do not at all wonder that blood has been shed over her.But to keep
her another hour in Simiti is to sacrifice her.If not, the people will drive you out.With the soldiers gone, the people will rise up against
you all.""But, friend, where shall we go?""There is
no place in Colombia now where she would be safe!""It can not be done," interposed Don Jorge."It would be impossible
for him to escape down the river with the girl, even if he had funds
to carry her away from Colombia, which he has not.To take the trail would only postpone for a short
time their certain capture.And then--well, we will not predict!To
flee into the jungle--or to hide among the _peones_ along the
trails--that might be done--yes.""What's the gibberish about now, pal?"put in Harris, whose knowledge
of the Spanish tongue was _nil_."Well, that's easy," returned Harris."Tell 'em you'll take the girl
out yourself.She's white enough to pass as your daughter, you know."Rosendo, stunned by the sudden departure of Ana, had sat in a state of
stupefaction during this conversation.But now he roused up and turned
to Reed.The latter translated his friend's suggestion, laughing as he
commented on its gross absurdity.Rosendo dropped his head again upon his chest and lapsed into silence.Then he rose unsteadily and passed a hand slowly across his brow.A
strange light had come into his eyes.For a moment he stood looking
fixedly at Reed."Senores," he said, rolling his syllables sonorously, "the time has
come at last!For years I have waited, waited, knowing that some day
the great gift which the good God put into my hands for the little
Carmen would be needed.The cruel
Spaniards drove them to and from their heavy labors with the lash; and
when the great war ended, they sank exhausted into their graves.My
parents--I have not told you this, Padre--were the slaves of Don
Ignacio de Rincon!"An exclamation burst from the astonished priest's lips.What, then,
had this man been concealing all these years?Little wonder that he
had hesitated when he learned that a Rincon had come to the parish of
Simiti!As he continued, his recital became
dramatic.As they listened, his auditors sat spellbound."Don Ignacio de Rincon himself was kind of heart.But his overseers--ah,
_Dios arriba_!Many a time the great lash wound
itself about my poor father's shrinking body, and hurled him shrieking to
the ground--and why?Because his blistered hands could not hold the
_batea_ with which he washed gold for your grandfather, Padre, your
grandfather!"A groan escaped him, and tears
trickled slowly down his sunken cheeks."I bear you no malice, Padre," continued Rosendo."It was hard those
first days to accept you here.But when, during your fever, I
learned from your own lips what you had suffered, I knew that you
needed a friend, and I took you to my bosom.And now I am glad--ah,
very glad, that I did so.But, though my confidence in you increased
day by day, I could never bring myself to tell you my great
secret--the secret that now I reveal for the sake of the little
Carmen.Padre--senores--I--_I am the owner of the great mine, La
Libertad_!"Had the heavens collapsed the astonishment of Don Jorge and the priest
could not have been greater.The coming of the soldiers, the terrific
strain of the past few days, culminating in the loss of Ana--all was
for the moment obliterated.Rosendo paused a moment for the effect which he knew his revelation
would produce, and then went on rapidly:

"Padre, the mine belonged to your grandfather.The gold taken from it was brought down the Guamoco trail to
Simiti, and from here shipped to Cartagena, where he lived in great
elegance.I make no doubt the gold which you and the little Carmen
discovered in the old church that day came from this same wonderful
mine.But the ore was quartz, and _arrastras_ were required to grind
it, and much skill was needed, too.He had men from old Spain, deeply
versed in such knowledge.Ah, the tales my poor father told of that
mine!"_Bien_, the war broke out.The Guamoco region became depopulated, and
sank back into the jungle.The location of the mine had been recorded
in Cartagena; but, as you know, when Don Ignacio fled from this
country he destroyed the record.He did the same with the records in
Simiti, on that last flying trip here, when he hid the gold in the
altar of the old church.And then the jungle grew up around the mine
during those thirteen long years of warfare--the people who knew of it
died off--and the mine was lost, utterly lost!"The little group sat enthralled before him.All
but Harris, who was vainly beseeching Reed to translate to him the
dramatic story."Padre," continued Rosendo at length, "from what my father had told me
I had a vague idea of the location of that mine.And many a weary day
I spent hunting for it!It was while I was on the Tigui, washing gold.I was
working near what we used to call _Pozo Cayman_, opposite La Colorado,
where the Frenchmen died.I camped on the lonely bank there, with only
the birds and the wondering animals to keep me company.One dark
night, as I lay on the ground, I had a dream.I dreamt that the Virgin, all in white, came to me where I
lay--that she whispered to me and told me to rise quickly and drive
away the devil.It was still dark, but a pair of fiery eyes were
gleaming at me from the bush.I seized my _machete_ and started after
them.It was a jaguar, Padre, and he fled up the hill from me.Why I
followed, I know not, unless I thought, still half asleep as I was,
that I was obeying the Virgin."At the top of the hill I lost the animal--and myself, as well.I am a
good woodsman, senores, and not easily lost.But this time my poor
head went badly astray.At last I
came to the edge of a steep ravine.I clambered down the sides into
the gully below.I thought it looked like an old trail, and I followed
it.So narrow was it at times that the walls almost touched.Then it widened, and I knew that at last I was in a trail,
long since abandoned--and how old, only the good God himself knew!"But my story grows as long as the trail!On and on I went, crossing
stream after stream, scaring snakes from my path, frightening the
birds above, who doubtless have never seen men in that region, all the
time thinking I was going toward the Tigui, until at last the old
sunken trail led me up a tremendous hill.At the top, buried in a
dense matting of brush, I fell over a circle of stones.They were the
remains of an ancient _arrastra_.Further on I found another; and
still another.Then, near them, the stone foundations of houses, long
since gone to decay.From these the trail took me into a gully, where
but little water flowed.I struck
off a piece from one of the largest.I went on up the stream, striking
off piece after piece from the great rocks.Every one showed specks of
free gold.Tunnel after tunnel yawned at me from the hillside.Some of
these were still open, where they had been driven through the hard
rock.I had my wallet, in which I always carry
matches and a bit of candle.far within I crossed a quartz vein--I scraped it with my
_machete_.it could not have been less than six feet in
width--and all speckled with gold!Above it, far into the blackness,
where bats were scurrying madly, the ore had been taken out long, long
ago.In the darkness below I stumbled over old, rusted tools.Every
one bore the inscription, 'I de R.'Your grandfather, Padre, put his
stamp on everything belonging to him.Then, as I sat trying to place
myself, my father's oft-told story of the location of the mine flashed
into my brain.I was at the headwaters of the Borrachera._And I had discovered La
Libertad_!"Reed's eager ears had drunk in every word of the old man's dramatic
story.When Rosendo
paused again, he quickly asked:

"The title, senor?"Rosendo drew forth a paper from his bosom."You will recall, Padre," he said, addressing the dully wondering
Jose, "that I once asked you to give me a name for a mine--a rare
name?And you told me to call it the--the--what is it?""Yes," exclaimed the old man excitedly, "that is it!_Bien_, I told no
one of my discovery of years before.I had never had money enough to
get the title to it.But when it seemed that I
might soon have use for it I sold my _finca_ for funds and had Lazaro
apply through Don Mario for title to a mine called--called--"

"The Chicago mine," said Jose, again coming to the rescue._Bien_, Lazaro got the title, which I never could have done,
for at that time Don Mario would not have put through any papers for
me.I then had the unsuspecting Lazaro transfer the title to me,
and--_Bien_, I am the sole owner of La Libertad!"Reed examined the paper at some length, and then handed it back to
Rosendo."Can we not talk business, senor?""I am so situated that I can float an American company
to operate this mine, and allow you a large percentage of the returns.he exclaimed, unable longer to contain himself, "it is
your fortune!""Senor," replied Rosendo, slowly shaking his head, "I want no share in
any of your American companies.But--your friend--he has suggested
just what has been running through my mind ever since you came to
Simiti."The wild, terrifying idea tore through
his fraught brain.He turned quickly to Reed and addressed him in
English."Such a thing is
quite out of the question!"Priest, Reed's wife is
in Cartagena, waiting for him.Came down from New York that far for
the trip.What's to prevent her from taking
the girl to the States and placing her in a boarding school there
until such time as you can either follow, or this stew down here has
settled sufficiently to permit of her returning to you?"Reed threw up a deprecatory hand."But," interposed Harris exasperatedly, "would you leave the ravishing
little beauty here to fall into the hands of the cannibals who are
trailing her?if it weren't for the looks of the thing I'd
take her myself.But you've got a wife, so it'd be easy."He leaned
over to Reed and concluded in a whisper, "The old man's going to make
a proposition--listen!""But," remonstrated the latter, "the expense of keeping her in New
York indefinitely!For, unless I mistake much, none of these people
will ever see the States after she leaves.And then I have an adopted
daughter on my hands!now that my ambitious wife is
determined to break into New York society with her adorable sister, I
have no money to waste on adopted children!"Rosendo, who had been studying the Americans attentively during their
conversation, now laid a hand on Reed's."Senor," he said in a quiet
tone, "if you will take the little Carmen with you, and keep her safe
from harm until Padre Jose can come to you, or she can be returned to
us here, I will transfer to you a half interest in this mine."he cried wildly, "do not do that!_Dios arriba_, no!Ah, senor," turning to Reed, "I beg you will
forgive--but Rosendo is mad to suggest such a thing!We cannot permit
it--we--I--oh, God above!"He sank again into his chair and covered
his face with his hands.Don Jorge gave vent to a long, low whistle.Rosendo, his voice husky
and his lips trembling, went on:

"I know, Padre--I know.I will give the mine to
the American--and to Carmen.He has a powerful government back of him,
and he is able to defend the title and save her interest as well as
his own.As for me, I--_Bien_, I shall want nothing when Carmen
goes--nothing.""If you
don't tell me what all this is about now I shall shoot--and not
straight up, either!""Senores," said Reed in a controlled voice, "let me talk this matter
over with my friend here.Rosendo and Don Jorge bowed and silently withdrew from the parish
house.The former went at once to apprise the wondering Dona Maria of
the events which had crowded the morning's early hours and to answer
her apprehensive questionings regarding Ana.Carmen was to know only
that Ana--but what could he tell her?That the woman had sacrificed
herself for the girl?No; but that they had seized this opportunity to
send her, under the protection of Captain Morales, to the Sisters of
the Convent of Our Lady.The old man knew that the girl would see only
God's hand in the event.It seemed to him that once his arms
closed about her no power under the skies could tear them asunder.He
found her sitting in the doorway at the rear of Rosendo's house,
looking dreamily out over the placid lake.Cucumbra, now old and
feeble, slept at her feet.As the man approached he heard her murmur
repeatedly, "It is not true--it is not true--it is not true!""Gladly, Padre--but where?""God only knows--to the end of the world!""Well, Padre dear," she softly replied, as she smiled up into his
drawn face, "we will start out.But I think we had better rest when we
reach the shales, don't you?"CHAPTER 35


"No, Padre dear," with an energetic shake of her head, "no.Not even
after all that has seemed to happen to us do I believe it true.No, I
do not believe it real.It does not exist,
excepting in the human mind.And that, as you yourself know, can not
be real, for it is all that God is not."They were seated beneath the slowly withering _algarroba_ tree out on
the burning shales.Jose still held the girl's hand tightly in his.Again he was struggling with self, struggling to pass the borderline
from, self-consciousness to God-consciousness; striving, under the
spiritual influence of this girl, to break the mesmeric hold of his
own mortal beliefs, and swing freely out into his true orbit about the
central Sun, infinite Mind.The young girl, burgeoning into a marvelous womanhood, sat before him
like an embodied spirit.Her beauty of soul shone out in gorgeous
luxuriance, and seemed to him to envelop her in a sheen of radiance.The brilliant sunshine glanced sparkling from her glossy hair into a
nimbus of light about her head.Her rich complexion was but faintly
suggestive to him of a Latin origin.Her oval face and regular
features might have indicated any of the ruddier branches of the
so-called Aryan stock.But his thought was not dwelling on these
things now.It was brooding over the events of the past few weeks, and
their probable consequences."Padre dear," she had said, when his tremulous voice ceased, "how
much longer will you believe that two and two are seven?And how much
longer will you try to make me believe it?Oh, Padre, at first you did
seem to see so clearly, and you talked so beautifully to me!And then,
when things seemed to go wrong, you went right back to your old
thoughts and opened the door and let them all in again.And so things
couldn't help getting worse for you.You told me yourself, long ago,
that you would have to empty your mind of its old beliefs.But I guess
you didn't get them all out.If you had cleaned house and got your
mind ready for the good thoughts, they would have come in.You know,
you have to get ready for the good, before it can come.But you go right on getting ready for evil.If you loved
God--really _loved_ Him--why, you would not be worried and anxious
to-day, and you would not be believing still that two and two are
seven.You told me, oh, so long ago!that this human life was just a
_sense_ of life, a series of states of consciousness, and that
consciousness was only mental activity, the activity of thought.Well,
I remembered that, and put it into practice--but you didn't.A true
consciousness is the activity of true thought, you said.A false
consciousness is the activity of false thought.True thought comes
from God, who is mind.False thought is the opposite of true thought,
and doesn't come from any mind at all, but is just supposition.A
supposition is never really created, because it is never real--never
truth.True thought becomes externalized to us in good, in harmony, in
happiness.False thought becomes externalized to us in unhappiness,
sickness, loss, in wrong-doing, and in death.It is unreal, and yet
awfully real to those who believe it to be real.Why don't you act
your knowledge, as you at first said you were going to do?I have all
along tried to do this.Whenever thoughts come to me I always look
carefully at them to see whether they are based on any real principle,
on God.Sometimes it
has been hard to tell just which were true and which false.And
sometimes I got caught, and had to pay the penalty.But every day I do
better; and the time will come at last when I shall be able to tell at
once which thoughts are true and which untrue.When that time comes,
nothing but good thoughts will enter, and nothing but good will be
externalized to me in consciousness.I shall be in heaven--all the
heaven there is.It is the heaven which Jesus talked so much about,
and which he said was within us all.It is so simple, Padre dear, so
simple!"The man sat humbly before her like a rebuked child.Indeed, these were the very things that he had taught her
himself.Why, then, had he failed to demonstrate them?Only because
he had attempted to mix error with truth--had clung to the reality and
immanence of evil, even while striving to believe good omnipotent and
infinite.He had worked out these theories, and they had appeared
beautiful to him.But, while Carmen had eagerly grasped and
assimilated them, even to the consistent shaping of her daily life to
accord with them, he had gone on putting the stamp of genuineness and
reality upon every sort of thought and upon every human event as it
had been enacted in his conscious experience.His difficulty was that,
having proclaimed the allness of spirit, God, he had proceeded to bow
the knee to evil.Carmen had seemed to know that the mortal, material
concepts of humanity would dissolve in the light of truth.He, on the
other hand, had clung to them, even though they seared the mind that
held them, and became externalized in utter wretchedness."When you let God's thoughts in, Padre, and drive out their
opposites, then sickness and unhappiness will disappear, just as
the mist disappears over the lake when the sun rises and the light
goes through it.If you really expected to some day see the now
'unseen things' of God, you would get ready for them, and you would
'rejoice always,' even though you did seem to see the wickedness of
Padre Diego, the coming of the soldiers, the death of Lazaro and Don
Mario, and lots of unhappiness about yourself and me.Those men are
not dead--except to your thought.You ought to know that all these
things are the unreal thoughts externalized in your consciousness.And, knowing them for what they really are, the opposites of God's
thoughts, you ought to know that they can have no more power over
you than anything else that you know to be supposition.We can
suppose that two and two are seven, but we can't make it true.The
supposition does not have any effect upon us.But as regards just thought--and you yourself said that everything
reduces to thought--why, people seem to think it is different.Don't you understand what the good man Jesus meant when he
told the Pharisees to first cleanse the cup and platter within,
that the outside might also be clean?Why, that was a clear case of
externalization, if there ever was one!Cleanse your thought, and
everything outside of you will then become clean, for your clean
thought will become externalized.You once said that you believed
in the theory that 'like attracts like.'I believe that
good thoughts attract good ones, and evil thoughts attract thoughts
like themselves.And you ought to know that your
life shows it, too.You hold fear-thoughts and worry-thoughts, and
then, just as soon as these become externalized to you as misfortune
and unhappiness, you say that evil is real and powerful, and that
God permits it to exist.Yes, God does permit all the existence
there is to a supposition--which is none.You pity yourself and all
the world for being unhappy, when all you need is to do as Jesus told
you, and know God to be infinite Mind, and evil to be only the
suppositional opposite, without reality, without life, without
power--unless you give it these things in your own consciousness.You
don't have to take thought for your life.You don't have to be
covetous, or envious, or fearful, or anxious.You couldn't do
anything if you were.Jesus said that
of himself he could do nothing.But--as soon as he recognized God as
the infinite principle of all, and acted that knowledge--why, then
he raised the dead!And at last, when his understanding was greater,
he dissolved the mental concept which people called his human body.Don't you see it, Padre--don't you?And yet:

"But, Carmen, padre Rosendo would send you out of the country with
these Americans!"And you have said that you have always feared
you would lose me.I have not
feared that I would lose you.But, Padre dear--"

The ghastly look on the man's face threw wide the flood-gates of her
sympathy."Padre--all things work together for good, you know.Listen--" She clung more closely to
him."Padre, it may be best, after all.You do not want me to stay always
in Simiti.And if I go, you will go with me, or soon follow.Oh, Padre
dear, you have told me that up in that great country above us the
people do not know God as you and I are learning to know Him.Padre--I
want to go and tell them about Him!I've wanted to for a long, long
time."The girl's eyes shone with a holy light.Her wistful face glowed with
a love divine."Padre dear, you have so often said that I had a message for the
world.Do not the people up north need that message?The people of Simiti are too dull to hear the message
now.But up there--Oh, Padre, it may be right that I should go!And, if it is right, nothing can prevent it, for the right _will_ be
externalized!Such a spirit as hers could not
long be confined within the narrow verges of Simiti.He must not
oppose his egoism to her interests.And, besides, he might follow
soon.it might be the opening of the
way to the consummation of that heart-longing for--

Ah, the desperate joy that surged through his yearning soul at the
thought!A year, two, three, and he would still
be a young man!She loved him--never had man had such proofs as he of
an affection so divine!"Carmen," he said tenderly, drawing her closer to him, "you may be
right.Yes--we will both go with the Americans.Once out of this
environment and free from ecclesiastical chains, I shall do better."The girl looked up at him with brimming eyes."Padre dear," she
whispered, "I want to go--away from Simiti.Juan--he asks me almost
every day to marry him.Even in
the church, when Don Mario was trying to get us, Juan said he would
save me if I would promise to marry him.He said he would go to
Cartagena and kill the Bishop.He--Padre,
he is a good boy.But--I do not--want to marry him."Jose knew how insistent Juan had
become."Padre, you--you are not always going to be a priest--are you?And--I--I--oh, Padre dear, I love you so!"She turned impulsively and
threw both arms about his neck."I want to see you work out your
problem.You can go with me--and I can always live
with you--and some day--some day--" She buried her face in his
shoulder.The artless girl had never seemed to think it unmaidenly to
declare her love for him, to show him unmistakably that she hoped to
become his wife.The beautiful child in his arms
was human!Young in years, and yet a woman by the conventions of these
tropic lands.Why, she had long
insisted that she would wait for him!And why should he now oppose the
externalization of that sweet thought?"Ah, _chiquita_," he murmured, "I will indeed go with you now!I will
send my resignation to the Bishop at once.No, I will wait and send it
from the States.I will renounce my oath, abjure my promise--"

The girl sat suddenly upright and looked earnestly into his eyes.But--I promised my mother, dearest one,
that I would always remain a priest--unless, indeed, the Church
herself should eject me from the priesthood.But, it was foolish--"

"And your mother--she expects you to keep your word?"The girl sat in pensive silence for a moment."But, Padre," she
resumed, "honesty--it is the very first thing that God requires of us.We have to be--we _must_ be honest, for He is Truth.He cannot see or
recognize error, you know.And so He cannot see you and help you if
you are dishonest."And I tried to be honest, even when circumstances and
my own poor resistive force combined to direct me into the priesthood.But--since that day I have lived a life of hypocrisy, not knowing how
to shape my course."But, Padre, the Church has not put you out?"But, if you went to the States--with me--would you be put out of the
Church?""Possibly, _chiquita_.""And what would that mean, Padre?""The disgrace that always attaches to an apostate priest, child.""And, Padre--your mother--what would she say?""It would kill her," he replied slowly.Carmen reflected long, while Jose, with ebbing hope, waited."Padre
dear," she finally said, "then you have not yet worked out your
problem--have you?"And he was now attempting to solve it by flight."I mean, Padre, you have not worked it out in God's way.For if you
had, no one would be hurt, and there could not be any disgrace, or
unhappiness--could there?""But, _chiquita_," he cried in despair, "nothing but excommunication
can release me!And I long ago ceased to look for that.You do not
understand--you are young!"Why, Padre dear, you can work it out, all out, in God's way.""But--must I remain here--can I let you go alone with the Americans--?""Yes, you can, if it is right," she answered gently.he cried, straining her in his arms."If you go with the
Americans, I shall, I must, go too!""Not unless it is right, Padre," she insisted."If it is right,
nothing can keep you from going.But, unless it is God's way--well,
you can not solve your problem by running away from it.""But--child--to remain here means--God above!you don't realize what
it may mean to us both!"Jose began to feel that they were
drifting hopelessly, abysmally apart."I have been cheated and thwarted all my
wretched life!I can not, would not, hold
you here, if the way opens for you to go!But--I can not remain here
without you--and live!""That is not true, Padre," replied the girl, slowly shaking her head."No human being is necessary to any one's happiness.You are trying to 'acquire that mind which was in
Christ.'If you are really progressing, why, you will surely be happy.But you must work it all out God's way.""And that--"

"You must be honest, Padre, honest with Him and with everybody.If you
can no longer be a priest--if you are not one, and never have been
one--you must be honest with the Church and with yourself.Why do you not write to the Bishop and
tell him all about it?You must--Padre, you _must_--be honest!Write to your
mother--write to the Bishop.But--oh,
Padre dear, you must trust Him, and you must--you _must_--know that He
is good, that He is infinite, and that there is no evil!Otherwise,
the good can not be externalized.If you did that, your problem would
be quickly solved.""Padre dear," she continued, "God is
life--there is no death.God is all
good--there is no poverty, no lack, no loss.God is infinite, and He
is mind--there is no inability to see the right and to do it.God is
my mind, my spirit, my soul, my all.I look at God constantly, and strive always to see only Him.But He is just as much to you as He is to me.You can not outline how
things will work out; but you can know that they can only work out in
the right way.Only by so doing can
you solve your problem.And I have
always worked for you that way.I have always thought the time would
come when you and I would live and work together--always.I have not said that it _had_ to be.If it works
out that way, I know I would be very happy.But, even if it does not,
I shall know that I can not be deprived of any good, for the good God
is everywhere, and He is love, and He has given me all happiness.And
now we must leave everything to Him, while we work, work, work to see
Him only everywhere."Suffering himself to be led by her, they
crossed the shales to the dust-laden road and made their way silently
through the burning heat into the village.At the door of the parish house stood Rosendo.His face was grave, but
his manner calm."Padre," he announced, "it is arranged."Jose's knees shook under him as he followed the old man into the
house.Reed, Harris, and Don Jorge sat about the table, on which were
strewn papers covered with figures and sketches.The priest sat down
dumbly and drew Carmen to him.Harris fell to devouring the girl with
his bulging eyes.Reed at once plunged into the topic under
consideration."I have been saying," he began, addressing the priest, "that I can
accept the proposal made by Don Rosendo, but with some amendments.Harris and I are under contract with the Molino Company to report upon
their properties along the Boque river.I am informed by Don Rosendo
that he is acquainted with these alleged mines, and knows them to be
worthless.Be that as it may, I am obliged to examine them.But I will
agree to take this girl to New York, under the protection of my wife,
upon the consideration that when I reach my home city I be allowed to
form a company to take over this mine, returning to the girl a
fifty-one per cent interest in the stock, one half of which she agrees
in writing to deliver to me immediately upon its issuance.Being under
contract, I can not accept it now.The balance of the stock must be
sold for development purposes.I further agree to place the girl in a
boarding school of the first quality in the States, and to bear all
expenses of her maintenance until such time as she is either
self-supporting, or one or several of you may come to her, or effect
her return to Colombia.Now, according to Ariza's sketches, we may
proceed up the Boque river to its headwaters--how far did you say,
friend?""Some hundred and fifty miles from Simiti, senor," replied Rosendo."And then," resumed Reed, "we can cut across country from the sources
of the Boque, following what is known as Rosario creek, down to the
river Tigui, striking the latter somewhere near the ancient point
known as La Colorado.""But, senor," interposed Rosendo, "remember that the headwaters of the
Boque are practically unknown to-day.Many years ago, when I was a
small lad, some liberated slaves worked along Rosario creek, which was
then one day's journey on foot with packs from La Colorado.But that
old trail has long since disappeared.Probably no one has been over it
since.""Very well," returned the practical Reed, "then we shall have to make
our own trail across the divide to the Tigui.But once at La Colorado,
you tell me there is an ancient trail that leads down to Llano, on the
Nechi river?""Yes, to the mouth of the Amaceri.Llano was something of a town long
ago.But river steamers that go up the Nechi as far as Zaragoza once a
month, or less frequently, still touch there, I am told.And so you
can get down the Cauca to Maganguey, where you can change to a
Magdalena river boat for Calamar.The trail
to Llano can not be more than fifty miles in length, and fairly
open."Harris, who had been studying the sketches, whistled softly.he muttered, "nearly two hundred miles, and all by foot, over
unspeakable jungle trails!""Very well, then," he continued, "we
had best set out as soon as possible.To you, friend Rosendo, I leave
all arrangements regarding supplies and _cargadores_.I will furnish
funds for the entire expedition, expecting to be reimbursed by La
Libertad."Carmen listened, with dilated eyes.Starting hurriedly after Rosendo, who rose immediately to inaugurate
preparations, he drew him into the latter's house.he
cried, his whole frame tremulous with agitation, "do you know what you
are doing?Do you--"

"_Na_, Padre," replied Rosendo gently, as he held up a restraining
hand, "it is best.I want the _Americanos_ to take Carmen.At any moment an order might come for your arrest or
mine.The struggle has been long, and I weary of it."He sat down in
exhaustion and mopped his damp brow.If I can but know that she is safe--_Bien_, that is all.From what we
have learned, this country will soon be plunged again into war.I do
not wish to live through another revolution.I seem
to have fought all my life.I doubt
if I could even hold it, were it known here that I had the title to
such a famous mine.But the _Americano_ can hold it.He will save Carmen's interest, and deal fairly with her._Bien_, let him place her in a school in the States.If you weather
the oncoming revolution, then you may be able to send for her."Rosendo," he said, "I will go with her.""Do you mean, Padre, that you
will leave the Church?""Can I remain longer in Simiti, where the people have become
divided--where they look upon me askance, as the cause of the trouble
that has befallen them?What, think you, will it mean to Simiti?And Wenceslas,
what has he further in store for you and me?What he has for Carmen,
we well know.But the disappearance
of Diego has not been explained.The trick which Anita played upon
Morales to save Carmen must bring down increased wrath upon our heads,
especially yours and mine.No, Rosendo, you and I must go, and go at
once!""We will pick her up in Cartagena.I have certain information to give him that will enlist his
services--information which, I think, will serve to introduce him
to His Grace, and somewhat abruptly.But, come, Rosendo, do you and
Dona Maria prepare for flight!"I will go with
the _Americanos_ up the Boque and to La Libertad.Then I will return
to Simiti--or to the _hacienda_ of Don Nicolas, if Maria wishes to
remain there while I am in the hills.But--do you go, Padre--go and
look after the girl.Yes,
Padre, go--go!""But--ah, Rosendo, you will reconsider?The Americans will take us all
for that mine!"No, Padre," said the old man firmly, but in a voice heavy with
sadness.My work is done when I have
seen the girl safely out of this unhappy country.Carmen came bounding in and flew into Rosendo's arms.she cried, aglow with animation, "we are all going to the States up
north!Oh, padre, isn't it beautiful!""Ah, _chiquita_," said Rosendo cheerily, straining her to him, "I
guess we have decided to send you on ahead--a little ahead of us.Your
old padre has some business he must attend to here before he leaves."Jose knew what his effort at cheerfulness was
costing him."But, padre Rosendo, you will come--later?She
looked into his eyes, pleading wistfully."Yes, little one, yes--of course.For where you are, there your old
padre will always be--always--always!"panted the girl under Rosendo's tight grasp as she
turned her head toward the priest."He goes with us," assured Rosendo--"I think--at least as far as the
coast.He will see Anita--and--" His voice broke, and he turned
abruptly away."And she will go to the States with us!cried the girl,
bounding up and down with joy.Jose turned and went quickly into his own house.With grim determination
he drew the battered haircloth trunk from beneath his bed and began
to throw his few effects into it.But he had scarce begun when Juan, now bearing the proud title of
official courier between Simiti and Bodega Central, entered with a
letter.Jose recognized the writing, and tore it open at once."My beloved son, at last, after these many years of most rigid
economy, even of privation, I have saved enough from my meager income,
together with what little you have been able to send me from time to
time, and a recent generous contribution from your dear uncle, to
enable me to visit you.I shall sail for Colombia just as soon as you
send me detailed instructions regarding the journey.And, oh, my son,
to see you offering the Mass in your own church, and to realize that
your long delayed preferment is even at hand, for so your good uncle
informs me daily, will again warm the blood in a heart long chilled by
poignant suffering.Till we meet, the Blessed Virgin shield you, my
beloved son."The letter slipped from the priest's fingers and drifted to the floor.With a moan he sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.CHAPTER 36


What had kept Jose de Rincon chained all these years to an institution
to which in thought, feeling, and sympathy he was so utterly alien, we
have repeatedly pointed out--a warped sense of filial devotion, a
devotion that would not willingly bring sorrow upon his proud,
sensitive mother, and yet the kind that so often accomplishes just
that which it strives to avoid.But yet he had somehow failed to note
the nice distinction which he was always making between the promises
he had given to her and the oath which he had taken at his ordination.He had permitted himself to be held to the Church by his mother's fond
desires, despite the fact that his nominal observance of these had
wrecked his own life and all but brought her in sorrow to the grave.The abundance of his misery might be traced to forgetfulness of the
sapient words of Jesus: "For whosoever shall do the will of my Father
which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."And he had sacrificed his new-found life to the
child.He had exhausted every expedient to keep himself in Simiti,
that he might transfer his own great learning to this girl, and at the
same time yield himself to her beneficent influence.Yet, despite his
vague hopes, he had always dimly seen the day when she would leave
him; but he had likewise tried to feel that when it arrived his own
status would be such that the ecclesiastical ties which bound him
would be loosened, and he would be free to follow her.the lapse
of years had brought little change in that respect.But now he saw the girl entering upon that very hour of departure
which all his life in Simiti had hung like a menacing cloud above
him.And the shock had been such that he had thrown every other
consideration to the winds, and, regardless of consequences, was madly
preparing to accompany her.Then, like a voice from the tomb, had come
his mother's letter.Indeed, for the past two nights sleep had
avoided his haggard eyes.In the feeble glow of his candle he sat in
his little bedroom by his rough, bare table, far into the hours of
morning, struggling, resolving, hoping, despairing--and, at last,
yielding.If he had been born anew that fateful day, seven years
before, when Rosendo first told him the girl's story, he had this
night again died.When the gray hours of dawn stole silently across
the distant hills he rose.He staggered as he passed out through the living room where
lay the sleeping Americans.Rosendo met him in front of the house.exclaimed the old man as he noted the priest's appearance."Do not speak of it, Rosendo."It has been hard on you, Padre.And in the States with her--"

"For God's sake, friend, never speak of that again!"How long will it take to complete your preparations?""_Bien_," returned the amazed Rosendo when he recovered his breath,
"we can get away to-morrow."But you--"

"Hear me, friend.Everything must be conducted in the greatest
secrecy.It must be given out that the Americans go to explore the
Boque; that you accompany them as guide; that Carmen goes as--as cook,
why not?""_Cierto_, she cooks as well as Maria."Juan must be kept in complete ignorance of the real nature
of your trip.He is the courier--I will see
that Fernando sends him again to Bodega Central to-morrow, and keeps
him there for several days.You say it is some two hundred miles to
Llano.How long will it take to go that distance?""Why--_Quien sabe_, Padre?""With a
fair trail, and allowing the _Americanos_ some time to prospect on the
Boque--where they will find nothing--and several days to look over La
Libertad, we ought to reach Llano in six weeks.""A week later, if you do not have to wait a month on the river bank
for the boat.""Then, all going well, within two months Carmen should be out of the
country."You and she--"

"Enough, friend."Go now and bid Carmen come to me immediately after the _desayuno_.Tell Dona Maria that I will eat nothing this morning.I am going up to
the old church on the hill."But Jose turned abruptly and
started away, leaving the old man in a maze of bewilderment.In the gloom of the old church Jose threw himself upon a bench near
the door, and waited torpidly.A few moments later came a voice, and
then the soft patter of bare feet in the thick dust without.Carmen
was talking as she approached.Jose rose in curiosity; but the girl
was alone.In her hand she held a scrubby flower that had drawn a
desperate nourishment from the barren soil at the roadside.She
glanced up at Jose and smiled."It is easy to understand their language, isn't it, Padre?They don't
speak as we do, but they reflect.They stand for His ideas in the human mind.And I. Aren't they wonderful, these flowers!But you know,
they are only the way we interpret certain of God's wonderful ideas.Only, because we mortals believe in death, we see these beautiful
things at last reflecting our thought of death--don't we?We see only
our thoughts, after all.Everything we see about us is reflected
thought.First we see our thoughts of life and beauty and good.And
then our thoughts of decay and death."But God--He never sees anything but the good," she went on."He sees
the real, not the supposition.And when we learn to see only as He
does, why, then we will never again see death.We will see ourselves
as we really are, immortal.Jesus learned
to see that way, didn't he?His thought was finally so pure that he
saw nothing but good.And that gave him such power that he did those
things that the poor, ignorant, wrong-thinking people called miracles.But they were only the things that you and I and everybody else ought
to be doing to-day--and would be doing, if we thought as he did,
instead of thinking of evil."But," she panted, as she sat down beside him, "I've talked a lot,
haven't I?And you sent for me because you wanted to talk.But,
remember," holding up an admonitory finger, "I shall not listen if you
talk anything but good.Oh, Padre dear," looking up wistfully into his
drawn face, "you are still thinking that two and two are seven!How can you ever expect to see good if
you look only at evil?If I looked only at wilted flowers I would
never know there were any others.""Carmen," he said in a hollow voice, "I love you.""Why, of course you do," returned the artless girl.You have just _got_ to love me and everything and everybody.But it had been floating like foam on
his tossing mind."You are going away from me," he continued, almost in a whisper."Why, no, Padre," she replied quickly; "you are going too!Padre
Rosendo said we could start to-morrow at sunrise.""I do not go," he said in a quavering voice.What meant this change which had
come over him so suddenly?His mother's face hovered before him in the dim light.Behind her
a mitered head, symbolizing the Church, nodded and beckoned
significantly.Back of them, as they stood between him and the
girl, he saw the glorified vision of Carmen.He
turned wearily from it to the gentle presence at his side."I stay--to work out--my problem," was his scarcely audible reply.But her breath came more quickly, and her hand
closed more tightly about his."Dearest one," he murmured, bending over the brown curls, "it is God's
way, I guess.Perhaps in the years which I have spent here with you I
have had the time and the opportunity to work out my salvation.But, though I strove in my way, I could not quickly
acquire your spirituality.I could not at once shake loose those
poisonous thoughts of a lifetime, which have at last become
externalized in separation from all that I hold dearest in this life,
you, my beloved girl, you."He buried his face in her luxuriant hair
and strove to hold back the rush of scalding tears."It but shows how poisonous thoughts separate us from all that is
good--even from God," he continued in a choked voice."Oh, my sweet
girl, I love you as it seems to me no human being could love another!It has been so from that first day when, a mere babe, your wonderful
eyes held me until I could read in them a depth of love for mankind
that was divine."It did not seem to him that a mature man was
speaking to a mere girl.She seemed, as always, ages beyond him in
wisdom and experience.Carmen reached up and wound her arms about his neck.He bent low and
kissed her brow.Then he drew himself up quickly and resumed his
broken talk."I believed at first that my salvation lay in you.And so it did, for
from your clear thought I gleaned my first satisfying knowledge of the
great principle, God.I could not seem to realize that
between recognizing righteousness as 'right-thinking' and daily
practicing it so as to 'prove' God there was a great difference.And
so I rested easy in my first gleams of truth, expecting that they
would so warm my soul that it would expand of itself out of all
error."She made as if to reply, but he checked her."I learned enough, I repeat, those first few months here to have
enabled me to work out my salvation, even though with fear and
trembling.But I procrastinated; I vacillated; I still clung to
effete beliefs and forms of thought which I knew were bound to
manifest in unhappiness later.I was afraid to boldly throw myself
upon my thought.Yes, the great Paul was at times
under the same mesmeric spell of human belief, even after he had seen
the vision of the Christ.And now
I see that I must do likewise, for salvation is an individual
experience.No vicarious effort, even of the Christ himself, can save
a man.We must apply it to our
problems ourselves.My unfinished task--scarcely even begun!--lies
still before me.My environment is what I have made it by my own
thought.I believe you, that I can enter another only as I externalize
it through righteousness, right-thinking, and 'proving' God."He paused and bent over the silent little figure nestling so quietly
at his side."You, Carmen, though but a child in years, have risen beyond me, and
beyond this lowly encompassment.Why, when you were a mere babe, you
should have grasped your padre Rosendo's casual statement that 'God is
everywhere,' and shaped your life to accord with it, I do not know.That must remain one of the hidden mysteries of God.But
the fact stands that you did grasp it, and that with it as a light
unto your feet you groped your way out of this environment, avoiding
all pitfalls and evil snares, until to-day you stand at the threshold
of another and higher one.So progress must ever be, I now realize.Up
we must rise from one plane of human mentality to another, sifting and
sorting the thoughts that come to us, clinging to these, discarding
those, until, even as you have said, we learn at last instantly to
accept those that mirror forth God, infinite, divine mind, and to
reject those that bear the stamp of supposition.""Padre," the girl said, lifting her beautiful face to his, "I have
told you so often--when a thought comes to me that I think is not from
God, or does not reflect Him, I turn right on it and kill it.You
could do the same, if you would.""Assuredly, child--if I would!"And then the millennium would be with us, and the
kingdom of heaven revealed.The mesmeric belief in evil as an entity
and a power opposed to good alone prevents that.Destroy this belief,
and the curtain will instantly rise on eternity."His eyes struggled with hers, as he gazed long and wistfully into
them.Lost in his impassioned speech, he had for the moment seemed to
be translated.Then a surge of fear-thoughts swept him, and left him
dwelling on the hazardous journey that awaited her.He wildly clutched
her again to his side."Carmen--child--how can I let you go!And that
awful journey--two hundred miles of unknown jungle, to the far-off
Nechi!And then the burning river, to Cartagena, where--where _he_ is!And the States--God, what awaits you there!""Padre," she answered softly, "I shall not go unless it is right.If
it is right, then God will take care of me--and of you."Again she saw only the "right-best" thought, while he sat trembling
before its opposite.And the opposite was as yet a supposition!"Padre dear, there is no separation, you know.God is everywhere, and
so there is no separation from good--is there?""Not in your thought, dearest child," he murmured huskily."Well, Padre dear, I am still with you, am I not?Can't you live one
day at a time?You are borrowing from
to-morrow, and you have no right to do it.God says,
'Thou shalt not steal,' even from to-morrow."The thought seemed to
lighten his load momentarily."You have been thinking so many bad thoughts of late--I don't suppose
you have had any good thoughts at all about Anita's little babe?"You promised me that every day you
would just _know_ that."Aye, his crowning sin was revealed again in
all its ugly nakedness.His thought was always of his own
troubles, his own longings, his own fears.Self-centeredness had left
no room for thoughts of Ana's blind babe.And why was he now straining
this beautiful girl to himself?Was it fear for her, or for himself?Yet she gave but little heed to her own needs.Always her concern was
for others, others who stumbled and drooped because of the human
mind's false, unreal, undemonstrable beliefs and ignorance of the
allness of God."Ah, child," he exclaimed penitently, "such love!How could I dare to
hope ever to claim it!"Why, Padre, I love the real 'you,' the 'you' that is going to be
brought out, and that will become more and more clear, until at last
it stands as the perfect reflection of God.Haven't I told you that,
time and time again?"But--to live with me--to be my--"

"Well, Padre, if we were not still human we would not be thinking that
we were on earth.We have got to work out of this human way of
thinking and living.And it has seemed to me that you and I could work
out of it so much better together, you helping me, manifesting God's
protection and care, and I helping you, as you say I can and do.And
how can we live together and work together unless we marry?He would not try to explain her reasoning, her contempt for
convention.As for him, women had never
constituted a temptation.He knew that he loved this simple, ingenuous
girl with a tenderness of passion that was wholly free from the dross
of mesmerism."Padre, if you think you must stay here for a little while, to work
out your problem, why, I shall just _know_ that evil can not separate
us.I don't like to even seem to go away without you.But--it will be
only seeming, after all, won't it?God's children can not really be
separated--never!"She was still paying faithful tribute to her vision of the spiritual
universe.How like a benison they
flowed over his drooping spirits!"And now, Padre dear," she said, rising from the bench,--"we have done
all we could--left everything with God--haven't we?I must go now, for
madre Maria told me to come back soon.Sing
again the sweet melody that I heard when I awoke from the fever that
day long ago!"Nestling close against him, her
head resting on his shoulder and her hand in his, she sang again the
song that had seemed to lift him that distant day far, far above the
pitiful longings and strivings of poor humanity, even unto the gates
of the city of eternal harmony.She finished, and the last clear, sweet note echoed through the musty
room and died among the black rafters overhead.A holy silence fell
upon them as they sat, hand in hand, facing the future.Hot tears were
streaming down the man's cheeks.They fell sparkling like drops of
dew upon her brown curls.The girl, obedient
to the vision, was reaping her reward.He, timid, wavering, doubting,
was left, still pecking at the shell of his dreary environment.It was
but the working of the infinite law of cause and effect.But did he
imagine that out in the world she would not still find tribulation,
even as the Saviour had said?But she
leaned on her sustaining God.She had already passed through such fiery trials that
he knew no contrary belief in evil now could weaken or counterbalance
her supreme confidence in immanent good."If I have to go and leave you, will you promise me that you will act
your knowledge of the Christ-principle and work out your problem, so
that you may come to me soon?"The tug at his heartstrings brought a moan to his lips."And--you will keep your promise about Anita's babe?"She rose and, still holding his hand, led him down the hill and to
Rosendo's house.Throughout the remainder of that feverishly busy day the priest clung
to the girl like a shadow.They talked together but little, for she
was in constant demand to help her foster-mother in the preparations
for the long journey.Again and again
he would seize her hand and press it to his burning lips.Again and
again he would stroke her soft hair, or stretch out his hand to touch
her dress as she passed him.Always when she glanced up at him the
same sweet, compassionate smile glowed on her face.When she left the
house, he followed.When she bent over the ash-strewn fireplace, or
washed the few plain dishes, he sought to share her employment; and,
when gently, lovingly repulsed, sat dully, with his yearning eyes
riveted upon her.Rosendo saw him, and forgot his own sorrow in pity
for the suffering priest.The preparations carried the toilers far into the night.But at length
the last bundle was strapped to its _siete_, the last plan discussed
and agreed upon, and the two Americans had thrown themselves upon
their cots for a brief rest before dawn.Rosendo took Jose aside,
while Dona Maria and Carmen sought their beds."Fernando sends Juan to Bodega Central at daybreak," the old man said.Maria remains
here with you until I return.Then we may go to the _hacienda_ of Don
Nicolas, on the Boque.I shall tell him to have it in readiness on my
return.I shall probably not get back to Simiti for two months.If, as
you say, you still think best not to go with the Americans and the
girl, what will you do here?Some say
they intend to ask the Bishop to remove you._Bien_, will you not
decide to go?"He shook his head, and waved
Rosendo away.Then, taking a chair, he went into the sleeping room and
sat down at the bedside of the slumbering girl.Reaching over, he took
her hand.What was it that she had said to him that day, long gone, when Diego
claimed her as his child?Ah, yes:

"Don't feel badly, Padre dear.His thoughts have only the minus
sign--and that means nothing, you know."And later, many weeks later:

"Padre, you can not think wrong and right thoughts together, you know.You can not be happy and unhappy at the same time.You can not be sick
and well together."In other words, the wise little maid was trying to
show him that Paul spoke directly to such as he when he wrote: Know ye
not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants
ye are--?"You can not have both good and evil, Padre," she had so often
insisted."You must want good--want it more than anything else.And
then you must prepare for it by thinking right thoughts and unthinking
wrong ones.And as you prepare for good, you must _know_ that it is
coming.But you must not say how it shall come, nor what it shall look
like.You must not say that it shall be just as you may think you
would like to have it."You see, Padre dear"--oh, how the memory of her words smote him
now!--"you see, the good Jesus told the people to clean their
window-panes and let in the light--good thoughts--for then these would
be externalized in health, happiness, and all good, instead of the
old, bad thoughts being externalized longer in sickness and evil.He saw that the Christ-idea found expression and
reflection in the pure mentality of this girl.He saw that that
mentality was unsullied, uneducated in the lore of human belief, and
untrained to fear.He saw that the resurrection of the Christ, for
which a yearning world waits, was but the rising of the Christ-idea
in the human mentality.And he saw, too, that ere the radiant
resurrection morn can arrive there must be the crucifixion, a
world-wide crucifixion of human, carnal thought.But will ye not learn that following him means _thinking_
as he did?But Jose had tried to think aright during those years in Simiti.True,
but the efforts had been spasmodic.From childhood he had passed
through doubt, fear, scepticism, and final agnosticism.Then he had
started anew and aright.And then had come the "day of judgment," the
recurrent hours of sore trial--and he had not stood.Called upon to
prove God, to prove the validity of his splendid deductions, he had
vacillated between the opposing claims of good and evil, and had
floundered helplessly.And now he stood confronting his still unsolved
problem, realizing as never before that in the solving of it he must
unlearn the intellectual habits of a lifetime.There were other problems which lay still unsolved before him as he
sat there that night.The sable veil of mystery which hung about
Carmen's birth had never been penetrated, even slightly.What woman's
face was that which looked out so sadly from the little locket?"Dolores"--sorrowful, indeed!What tragedy had those great, mournful
eyes witnessed?He used to
think so, but not of late.Did she, he wondered, resemble the man?And
had the mother's kisses and hot tears blurred the portrait beneath
which he had so often read the single inscription, "Guillermo"?If so,
could not the portrait be cleaned?But Jose himself had not dared
attempt it.Perhaps some day that could be done by one skilled in such
art.And did Carmen inherit any of her unique traits from either of her
parents?Her voice, her religious instinct, her keen mentality--whence
came they?"From God," the girl would always answer whenever he voiced
the query in her presence.And Jose found himself sitting beside the
sleeping girl and dumbly yielding to the separation which now had
come.And, if he must live and
solve his problem, could he stand after she had left?He bent closer
to her, and listened to the gentle breathing.He seemed again to see
her, as he was wont in the years past, flitting about her diminutive
rose garden and calling to him to come and share her boundless joy."Come, Padre dear, and see my beautiful
thoughts!"And then, so often, "Oh, Padre!"bounding into his arms,
"here is a beautiful thought that came to me to-day, and I caught it
and wouldn't let it go!"Lonely, isolated child, having nothing in
common with the children of her native heath, yet dwelling ever in a
world peopled with immaculate concepts!He thought of the day when he had
approached Rosendo with his great question."Rosendo," he had said in
deep earnestness, "where, oh, where did Carmen get these ideas?"No, Padre," Rosendo had replied gravely."When she was a little
thing, just learning to talk, she often asked about God.And one day I
told her that God was everywhere--what else could I say?_Bien_, a
strange light came into her eyes.And after that, Padre, she talked
continually about Him, and to Him.And she seemed to know Him well--so
well that she saw Him in every thing and every place.Padre, it is
very strange--very strange!"No, it was not strange, Jose had thought, but beautifully natural.And
later, when he came to teach her, his constant endeavor had been to
impart his secular knowledge to the girl without endangering her
marvelous faith in her immanent God.In that he had succeeded, for in
that there had been no obstructing thoughts of self to overcome.And now--

"For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will
I gather thee--"

The night shadows fled.Jose still sat at the girl's
bedside, dumb and motionless.Carmen awoke, and threw her arms about
him.But Rosendo appeared and hurried her out to the light morning
repast, for they must lose no time in starting.By ten o'clock the savannas would be too hot to cross, and
they lay some distance from Simiti.Reed and Harris were bustling
about, assembling the packers and cracking jokes as they strapped the
chairs to the men's backs.Dona Maria's eyes were red with weeping,
but she kept silence.Don Jorge
grimly packed his own kit and prepared to set out for the Magdalena,
for he had suddenly announced his determination not to accompany
Rosendo and his party, but to go back and consult with Don Carlos
Norosi in regard to the future.At last Rosendo's voice rang out in a great shout:

"_Ya esta!"_

"Bully-bueno!"The _cargadores_ moved forward in the direction of the Boque trail.The Americans, with a final _adios_ to Dona Maria and the priest,
swung into line behind them.Rosendo again tenderly embraced his
weeping spouse, and then, turned to Jose."The Virgin watch over you and Maria, Padre!If the war comes, flee with her to the Boque."He threw an arm about the priest and kissed him on both cheeks.Then,
calling to Carmen, he turned and started after the others."Padre," she murmured, clinging to him and showering him with kisses,
"I love you, love you, love you!You
will come--or I will come back to you.And I will work for you every
day.I will know that you are God's child, and that you will solve
your problem!"Rosendo, half way down the road, turned and called sharply to her.But again she stopped, turned around, and flew
back to Jose, as he knelt in the dust and, with tongue cleaving to his
mouth, held out his trembling arms."Padre, dearest, dearest Padre," she sobbed, "I love you, I love you!And--I had forgotten--this--it is for you to read every day--every
day!"Again she tore herself
away and ran after the impatient Rosendo.In a moment they were out of
sight.A groan of anguish escaped the stricken priest.He rose from his knees
and followed stumbling after the girl.As he reached the shales he saw
her far in the distance at the mouth of the trail.She turned, and
waved her hand to him.Then the dark trail swallowed her, and he saw
her no more.For a moment he stood like a statue, striving with futile gaze to
penetrate that black opening in the dense bush that had engulfed his
very soul.His hand
closed convulsively over the paper which the girl had left with him.Mechanically he opened it and read:

  "Dearest, dearest Padre, these four little Bible verses I leave
  with you; and you will promise your little girl that you will
  always live by them.Thou shall have no other gods before me.Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
  heaven is perfect.Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."And, Padre, my dearest, dearest Padre, _God is everywhere_."His brain reeled, and he swayed like a drunken man.He
turned about, muttering incoherently.Tenderly taking his arm, she led him back to the forlorn little house.Its ghastly emptiness smote him until his reason tottered.He sank
into a chair and gazed with dull, stony eyes out over the placid
lake, where the white beams of the rising sun were breaking into
myriad colors against the brume.CHAPTER 37


The two hundred miles which lay before Rosendo and his little band
stretched their rugged, forbidding length through ragged canons,
rushing waters, and dank, virginal forest.Only the old man, as he
trudged along the worn trail between Simiti and the Inanea river,
where canoes waited to transport the travelers to the little village
of Boque, had any adequate conception of what the journey meant.Even
the _cargadores_ were unfamiliar with the region which they were to
penetrate.Some of them had been over the Guamoco trail as far as
Culata; a few had ascended the Boque river to its farthest navigable
point.But none had penetrated the inmost reaches of the great canon
through which the headwaters tumbled and roared, and none had ever
dreamed of making the passage over the great divide, the _Barra
Principal_, to the Tigui beyond.To the Americans, fresh from the luxury and convention of city life,
and imbued with the indomitable Yankee spirit of adventure, the
prospect was absorbing in its allurements.Especially to the
excitable, high-strung Harris, whose great eyes almost popped from his
head at the continuous display of tropical marvels, and whose
exclamations of astonishment and surprise, enriched from his
inexhaustible store of American slang and miner's parlance, burst from
his gaping mouth at every turn of the sinuous trail.From the outset,
he had constituted himself Carmen's special protector, although
much to Rosendo's consternation, for the lank, awkward fellow, whose
lean shoulders bent under the weight of some six-feet-two of
height, went stumbling and tripping along the way, swaying against
every tree and bush that edged the path, and constantly giving noisy
vent to his opinions regarding trails in general, and those of the
tropics in particular.His only accouterment was a Winchester
rifle of tremendous bore, which he insisted on carrying in constant
readiness to meet either beasts of prey or savage Indians, but
which, in his absent-mindedness and dreamy preoccupation, he
either dragged, muzzle up, or carried at such dangerous angles that
the natives were finally obliged, in self-protection, to insist
that he hand the weapon over to Rosendo.To Carmen, as the days
passed and she gradually recognized his sterling qualities, he
became a source of delight.Hour after hour she trotted along after
him, chatting merrily in her beloved English tongue, poking fun at
his awkwardness, and laughing boisterously over his quaint slang and
naive Yankee expressions.She had never heard such things from Jose;
nor had the priest, despite his profound knowledge, ever told her
such exciting tales as did Harris, when he drew from his store of
frontier memories and  his narratives with the rich tints
furnished by his easy imagination.The first day out had been one of mental struggle for the girl.She
had turned into the trail, after waving a last farewell to Jose, with
a feeling that she had never experienced before.For hours she trudged
along, oblivious of her environment, murmuring, "It isn't true--it
isn't true!"until Harris, his curiosity aroused by the constant
repetition which floated now and then to his ears, demanded to know
what it was that was so radically false."It isn't true that we can be separated," she answered, looking at him
with moist eyes."Yes, God's children--people--people--who--love each other," she
replied.Then she dropped her eyes in evident embarrassment, and
refused to discuss the topic further.ejaculated Harris, pondering the cryptical remark, "you
surely are a queer little dud!"But the girl turned from him to Rosendo.Nor would
she permit the old man to leave her until, late that night, exhausted
by the excitement of the day, she dropped asleep in the house of Don
Nicolas, on the muddy margin of the river Boque, still clinging to
Rosendo's hand.Despite the protestations of Don Nicolas and the pleading of the
_cargadores_, Rosendo stolidly refused to spend a day at Boque.They were still within reach of
the federal authorities.He dared not rest until the jungle had
swallowed them."Ah, _compadre_," said Don Nicolas, in disappointment, "I would like
much for you to enjoy my house while it is still clean.they swarmed down upon us but a day ago.They came out of the bush in millions, straight for the house.had we remained, we should have been eaten alive.But
they swept the house--_Hombre_!no human hands could have done so
well.Every spider, every rat, beetle, flea, every plague, was
instantly eaten, and within a half hour they had disappeared again,
and we moved back into a thoroughly cleaned house!"Harris stood with mouth agape in mute astonishment when Carmen, whom
he had constituted his interpreter, translated to him the story.That evening, after they had eaten out in the open before the house,
and the Americans had tickled the palates of the villagers with some
tinned beef of uncertain quality, Don Nicolas approached Reed."Senor," he said, "my mother, now very aged, is sick, and we think she
can not recover.But you Americanos are wonderfully skilled, and your
medicines powerful.Have you not some remedy in your pack that will
alleviate the good woman's sufferings?Reed knew how great was the faith of these simple people in the wisdom
of the American, and he had reason to wish to preserve it.But he had
come into that country illy prepared to cope with disease, and his
medical equipment contained nothing but quinine.He reflected a
moment, then turned to Harris."Did you smuggle any of your beloved root-beer extract into the
equipment?"Harris looked sheepish, but returned a sullen affirmative."Well," continued Reed, "dig out a bottle and we'll fix up a dose of
pain-killer for our worthy host's mother.""Cierto, senor," he said with an air of
confidence."I have a remedy which I know to be unfailing for any
disease."He disappeared into the house, from which he emerged again in a few
moments with an empty cola bottle.Washing this clean in the river, he
partly filled it with water.Then he poured in the small bottle of
root-beer extract which Harris handed him, and added a few grains of
quinine.Shaking the mixture thoroughly, he carried it to Don
Nicolas."Be very careful, senor," he admonished, giving him the bottle."It is
a medicine extremely powerful and immediate in its action.Give the
senora a small teaspoonful every hour.By morning you will notice a
marked change."Don Nicolas's eyes lighted with joy, and his gratitude poured forth in
extravagant expressions.With the first indications of approaching day Rosendo was abroad,
rounding up his cargadores, who were already bickering as to their
respective duties, and arranging the luggage in the canoes for the
river trip.Additional boats and men had been secured; and Don Nicolas
himself expressed his intention of accompanying them as far as his
hacienda, Maria Rosa, a day's journey up-stream."It was there that I hid during the last revolution," he said, "when
the soldiers burned the village and cut off the ears and fingers of
our women for their rings.Ah, senores, you can not know how we
suffered!All my goods stolen or burned--my family scattered--my
_finca_ destroyed!We lived two years at Maria Rosa, not daring to
come down the river again.His eyes burned fiercely as he spoke, and his hands opened
and closed convulsively.He was a representative of that large class
of _rurales_ upon whom the heaviest burdens, the greatest suffering,
and the most poignant sorrow attending a political revolution always
fall.he exclaimed, suddenly turning to Reed, "I had all but
forgotten!She would see the kind
American whose remedies are so wonderful.For, senor, she rose from
her bed this morning restored!And you must leave us another bottle of
the remedy--at whatever price, senor!"Reed gazed at the man uncomprehendingly, until at length the truth
dawned upon him.His root-beer remedy had done its work!Then a broad
grin mantled his face; but he quickly suppressed it and went with Don
Nicolas to receive in person his patient's effusive thanks.When he
returned and took his place in the waiting boat, he shook his head."It's past all understanding," he muttered to Harris, "what faith will
do!I can believe now that it will remove mountains."Throughout the long, interminably long, hot day the perspiring men
poled and paddled, urged and teased, waded and pushed against the
increasing current, until, as the shadows began to close around them,
they sighted the scarcely visible opening in the bush which marked the
trail to the _hacienda_ of Maria Rosa.It was a desperately lonely
clearing on the verge of the jungle; but there were two thatch-covered
sheds, and to the exhausted travelers it gave assurance of rest and
protection.Before they made the landing Rosendo's sharp eyes had
spied a large ant-eater and her cub, moving sluggishly through the
bush; and Reed's quick shots had brought them both down.The men's
eyes dilated when the animals were dragged into the canoes.It meant
fresh meat instead of salt _bagre_ for at least two days.Early next morning the travelers bade farewell to Don Nicolas and set
their course again up-stream.They would now see no human being other
than the members of their own little party until they reached Llano,
on the distant Nechi."Remember," called Don Nicolas, as the canoes drifted out into the
stream, "the _quebrada_ of Caracoli is the third on the right.An old
trail used to lead from there across to the Tiguicito--but I doubt if
you find even a trace of it now.There is no water between that point
and the Tiguicito._Conque, adios, senores, adios_!"The hallooing of farewells echoed along the river and died away in the
dark forest on either hand.Harris and Reed settled back in their
canoe and yielded to the fascination of the slowly shifting scene.Carmen chose to occupy the same canoe with them, and perforce Rosendo
acted as _patron_.Between his knees
Reed held the rifle upright, in readiness for any animal whose
curiosity might bring it to the water's edge to view the rare pageant
passing through that unbroken solitude.The river was now narrowing, and there were often rapids whose ascent
necessitated disembarking from the canoes, while the _bogas_ strained
and teased the lumbering dugouts up over them.In places the stream
was choked by fallen trees and tangled driftwood, until only a narrow,
tortuous opening was left, through which the waters raced like a
mill-course, making a heavy draft on the intuitive skill of the
_bogas_.Often slender islets rose from the river; and then heated,
chattering, often acrimonious discussions ensued among the men as to
the proper channel to take.Always on either side rose the matted,
tangled, impenetrable forest wall of dense bush and giant trees, from
which innumerable trailers and _bejuco_ vines dropped into the waters
beneath.From the surface of the river to the tops of the great trees,
often two hundred feet above, hung a drapery of creeping plants, of
parasitical growths, and diversified foliage, of the most vivid shades
of green, inextricably laced and interwoven, and dotted here and there
with orchideous flowers and strange blossoms, while in the tempered
sunlight which sifted through it sported gorgeous insects and
butterflies of enormous size and exquisite shades, striped and spotted
in orange, blue, and vivid red.Scarcely a hand's breadth of the
jungle wall but contained some strange, eerie animal or vegetable form
that brought expressions of wonder and astonishment from the
enraptured Americans.At times, too, there were grim tragedies being
enacted before them.In one spot a huge, hairy spider, whose delicate,
lace-like web hung to the water's edge, was viciously wrapping its
silken thread about a tiny bird that had become entangled.Again, a
shriek from beyond the river's margin told of some careless monkey or
small animal that had fallen prey to a hungry jaguar.Above the
travelers all the day swung the ubiquitous buzzards, with their
watchful, speculative eyes ever on the slowly moving cavalcade.If her thought reverted at all to the priest,
she gave no hint of it.But once, leaning back and gazing off into
the opalescent sky overhead, she murmured: "And to think, it is only
the way the human mind translates God's ideas!And some day I shall see those ideas, instead of the mortal mind's
interpretations of them!"Harris heard her, and asked her to repeat her comments in English."You would not understand," she said simply.And no
badinage on his part could further influence her.Rosendo, inscrutable and silent, showed plainly the weight of
responsibility which he felt.Only twice that day did he emerge from
the deep reserve into which he had retired; once when, in the far
distance, his keen eye espied a small deer, drinking at the water's
edge, but which, scenting the travelers, fled into cover ere Reed
could bring the rifle to his shoulders; and again, when they were upon
a jaguar almost before either they or the astonished animal realized
it.In the tempered rays of the late afternoon sun the flower-bespangled
walls of the forest became alive with gaily painted birds and insects.Troops of chattering monkeys awoke from their midday _siesta_ and
scampered noisily through the treetops over the aerial highways
formed by the liana vines, whose great bush-ropes, often a foot and
more in thickness, stretched their winding length long distances
through the forest, and bound the vegetation together in an
intricate, impenetrable network.Yellow and purple blossoms, in a
riot of ineffable splendor, bedecked the lofty trees and tangled
parasitical creepers that wrapped around them, constituting
veritable hanging gardens.Great palms, fattened by the almost
incessant rains in this hot-house of Nature, rose in the spaces
unoccupied by the buttressed roots of the forest giants.Splendidly
tailored kingfishers swooped over the water, scarce a foot above its
surface.Quarreling parrots and nagging macaws screamed their
inarticulate message to the travelers.Tiny forest gems, the
infinitely variegated _colibri_, whirred across the stream and
followed its margins until attracted by the gorgeous pendent flowers.On the _playas_ in the hazy distance ahead the travelers could often
distinguish tall, solemn cranes, dancing their grotesque measures, or
standing on one leg and dreaming away their little hour of life in
this terrestrial fairy-land.Darkness fell, almost with the swiftness of a snuffed candle.For an
hour Rosendo had been straining his eyes toward the right bank of the
river, and as he gazed his apprehension increased.But, as night
closed in, a soft murmur floated down to the cramped, toil-worn
travelers, and the old man, with a glad light in his eyes, announced
that they were approaching the _quebrada_ of Caracoli.A half hour
later, by the weird, flickering light of the candles which Reed and
Harris held out on either side, Rosendo turned the canoe into a
brawling stream, and ran its nose into the deep alluvial soil.Plunging fearlessly through the fringe of delicate ferns which lined
the margin of the creek, he cut a wide swath with his great _machete_
and uncovered a dim trail, which led to a ramshackle, thatch-covered
hut a few yards beyond.It was the tumbled vestige of a shelter which
Don Nicolas had erected years before while hunting wild pigs through
this trackless region.An hour later the little group lay asleep on
the damp ground, wrapped in the solitude of the great forest.The silvery haze of dawn was dimming the stars and deepening into
ruddier hues that tinged the fronds of the mighty trees as with
streaks of blood when Rosendo, like an implacable Nemesis, prodded his
little party into activity.Their first day's march through the
wilderness was to begin, and the old man moved with the nervous,
restless energy of a hunted jaguar.The light breakfast of coffee and
cold _arepa_ over, he dismissed the _bogas_, who were to return to
Boque with the canoes, and set about arranging the cargo in suitable
packs for the _cargadores_ who were to accompany him over the long
reaches of jungle that stretched between them and Llano.Two
_macheteros_ were sent on ahead of the main party to locate and open a
trail.Before the shimmering,
opalescent rays which overspread the eastern sky had begun to turn
downward, the little cavalcade, led by Rosendo, had taken the narrow,
newly-cut trail and plunged into the shadows of the forest--

  "the great, dim, mysterious forest, where uncertainty wavers to an
  interrogation point."CHAPTER 38


The emotion of the jungle is a direct function of human temperament.Where one sees in it naught but a "grim, green sepulcher," teeming with
malignant, destructive forces, inimical to health, to tranquillity, to
life, another--perhaps a member of the same party--will find in the
wanton extravagance of Nature, her prodigious luxury, her infinite
variety of form, of color, and sound, such stimuli to the imagination,
and such invitation to further discovery and development, as to
constitute a lure as insidious and unescapable as the habit which too
often follows the first draft of the opium's fumes.There are those
who profess to have journeyed through vast stretches of South
American _selva_ without encountering a wild animal.Others, with sight
and hearing keener, and with a sense of observation not dulled by
futile lamentations over the absence of the luxuries of civilized
travel, will uncover a wealth of experiences which feed the memory
throughout their remaining years, and mold an irresistible desire to
penetrate again those vast, teeming, baffling solitudes.It is true, the sterner aspect of the South American jungle
affords little invitation to repose or restful contemplation.And
the charm which its riotous prodigality exerts is in no sense
idyllic.For the jungle falls upon one with the force of a blow.It
grips by its massiveness, its awful grandeur.It does not entice
admiration, but exacts obeisance by brute force.Its rest is continuous motion, incessant activity.The
garniture of its trackless wastes is that of great daubs of vivid
color, laid thick upon the canvas with the knife--never modulated,
never worked into delicate shading with the brush, but attracting
by its riot, its audacity, its immensity, its disdain of convention,
its utter disregard of the canons cherished by the puny mind that
contemplates it.The forest's appeal is a reflex of its own infinite
complexity.The sensations which it arouses within the one who steps
from civilization into its very heart are myriad, and often
terrible.The instinct of self-preservation is by it suddenly,
rudely aroused and kept keenly alive.The roar of its howling monkeys strikes terror to the timid heart.The plaintive calls of its persecuted feathered denizens echo through
the mysterious vastnesses like despairing voices from a spirit
world.The crashing noises, the strange, weird, unaccountable
sounds that hurtle through its dimly lighted corridors blanch the
face and cause the hand to steal furtively toward the loosely
sheathed weapon.The piercing, frenzied screams which arise with
blood-curdling effect through the awful stillness of noonday or the
dead of night, turn the startled thought with sickening yearning
toward the soft charms of civilization, in which the sense of
protection is greater, even if actual security is frequently less.Because of Nature's utter disregard of the individual, life is
everywhere.And that life is sharply armed and on the defensive.Their droning murmur crowds the air.The trunks of trees, the
great, pendent leaves of plants, the trailing vines, slimy with dank
vegetation, afford footing and housing to countless myriads of
them, keenly alert, ferociously resistive.The decaying logs fester
with scorpions.The ground is cavernous with the burrows of
lizards and crawling forms, with centipedes and fierce formicidae.Where
one falls, countless others spring up to fill the gap.The rivers
and _pantanos_ yield their quota of variegated forms.The flat
_perania_, the dreaded electric eel, infests the warm streams, and
inflicts its torture without discrimination upon all who dare invade
its domain.Snakes lurk in the fetid swamps and lagoons, the
brilliant coral and the deadly _mapina_.Beneath the forest leaves
coils the brown adder, whose sting proves fatal within three days.To those who see only these aspects of the jungle, a journey such as
that undertaken by Rosendo and his intrepid little band would prove a
terrifying experience, a constant repetition of nerve-shocks, under
which the "centers" must ultimately give way.But to the two
Americans, fresh from the mining camps of the West, and attuned to any
pitch that Nature might strike in her marvelous symphony, the
experience was one to be taken in the same spirit as all else that
pertained to their romantic calling.Rosendo and his men accepted the
day's stint of toil and danger with dull stolidity.Carmen threw
herself upon her thought, and saw in her shifting environment only the
human mind's interpretation of its mixed concept of good and evil.The
insects swarmed around her as around the others.The tantalizing
_jejenes_ urged their insidious attacks upon her, as upon the rest.Her hands were dotted with tiny blood-blisters where the ravenous
gnats had fed.But she uttered no complaint; nor would she discuss the
matter when Harris proffered his sympathy, and showed his own red
hands."It isn't true," she would say."But you have no religion, and you
don't understand--as yet."Well, you have mighty
strange beliefs, young lady!""But not as strange and illogical as those you hold," she replied."Oh, I don't believe anything," he answered, with a shrug of his
shoulders."I'm an agnostic, you know.""There is just where you mistake, Mr."For, instead of not believing anything, you firmly believe in the
presence and power of evil.It is just those very people who boast
that they do not believe in anything who believe most thoroughly in
evil and its omnipotence and omnipresence."Yes, even the animals which she saw about her were but the human
mind's concepts of God's ideas--not real.In the
Bible allegory, or dream, the human, mortal mind names all its own
material concepts.From the rippling Tiguicito,
which they reached choking with thirst and utterly exhausted, they
dropped down again to the Boque, where they established camps and
began to prospect the Molino company's "near-mines," as Harris called
them after the first few unsuccessful attempts to get "colors" out of
the barren soil.At certain points, where there seemed a more likely
prospect, they remained for days, until the men, under Rosendo's
guidance, could sink pits to the underlying bedrock.Such work was
done with the crudest of tools--an iron bar, wooden scrapers in lieu
of shovels, and wooden _bateas_ in which the men handed the loosened
dirt up from one stage to another and out to the surface.It was slow,
torturing work.The food ran low, and they
complained.Then Harris one evening stumbled upon a tapir, just as the great
animal had forded the river and was shambling into the bush
opposite.It fell
with a broken hip, and the men finished it with their _machetes_.Its hide was nearly a half inch in thickness, and covered with
_garrapatas_--fierce, burrowing vermin, with hooked claws, which
came upon the travelers and caused them intense annoyance throughout
the remainder of the journey.Then Reed shot a deer, a delicate, big-eyed creature that had never
seen a human being and was too surprised to flee.Later, Fidel Avila
felled another with a large stone.And, finally, monkeys became so
plentiful that the men all but refused to eat them any longer.Two weeks were spent around the mouth of the Tiguicito and the Boque
canon.The little party
shouldered their packs and began the ascent of the ragged gorge.For
days they clambered up and down the jagged walls of the cut, or
skirted its densely covered margin.Twice Harris fell into the
brawling stream below, and was fished out by Rosendo, his eyes
popping, and his mouth choked with uncomplimentary opinion regarding
mountain travel in the tropics.Once, seizing a slender vine to aid
him in climbing, he gave a sudden lurch and swung out unexpectedly
over the gorge, hundreds of feet deep.Again Rosendo, who by this time
had learned to keep one eye on the ground and the other on the
irresponsible Harris, rescued him from his perilous position."Why don't you watch where you are going?""I might," sputtered Harris, "if I could keep my eyes off of you."Whereat Carmen pursed her lips and told him to reserve his compliments
for those who knew how to appraise them rightly.They camped where night overtook them, out in the open, often falling
asleep without waiting to build a fire, but eating soggy corn _arepa_
and tinned food, and drinking cold coffee left from the early morning
repast.But sometimes, when the fatigue of day was less, they would
gather about their little fire, chilled and dripping, and beg Carmen
to sing to them while they prepared supper.Then her clear voice would
ring out over the great canon and into the vast solitudes on either
hand in strange, vivid contrast to the cries and weird sounds of the
jungle; and the two Americans would sit and look at her as if they
half believed her a creature from another world.Sometimes Harris
would draw her into conversation on topics pertaining to philosophy
and religion, for he had early seen her bent and, agnostic that he
was, delighted to hear her express her views, which to him were so
childishly impossible.But as often he would voluntarily retire from
the conflict, sometimes shaking his head dubiously, sometimes
muttering his impatience with a mere child whose logic he, despite his
collegiate training, could not refute.He was as full of philosophical
theories as a nut with meat; but when she asked for proofs, for less
human belief and more demonstration, he hoisted the white flag and
retired from the field.But his admiration for the child became
sincere.And by the time
they had reached the great divide through which the Rosario fell, he
was dimly aware of a feeling toward the beautiful creature who walked
at his side day after day, sharing without complaint hardship and
fatigue that sorely taxed his own endurance, that was something more
than mere regard, and he had begun to speculate vaguely on a possible
future in which she became the central figure.At Rosario creek they left the great canon and turned into the rugged
defile which wound its tortuous course upward into the heights of the
_Barra Principal_.They were now in a region where, in Rosendo's
belief, there was not one human being in an area of a hundred square
miles.He himself was in sore doubt as to the identity of the
_quebrada_ which they were following.But it tallied with the brief
description given him by Don Nicolas.And, moreover, which was even
more important, as they began its ascent there came to him that sense
of conviction which every true son of the jungle feels when he is
following the right course.He might not say how he knew he was right;
but he followed the leading without further question.Up over the steep talus at the base of the canon wall they clambered,
up into the narrowing _arroyo_, cutting every foot of the way, for the
_macheteros_ were now no longer keeping ahead of them--the common
danger held the band united.Often they believed they discovered
traces of ancient trails.But the jealous forest had all but
obliterated them, and they could not be certain.In the higher and
drier parts of the forest, where they left the creek and followed
the beds of dead streams, slender ditches through which the water
raced in torrents during the wet season, they were set upon by
countless swarms of bees, a strange, stingless variety that covered
them in a buzzing, crawling mass, struggling and fighting for the
salt in the perspiration which exuded from the human bodies.Harris
swore he would cease to eat, for he could not take even a mouthful
of food without at the same time taking in a multitude of bees.Often, too, their _machetes_ cut into great hornet nests.Then, with
the shrill cry, "_Avispas_!"Rosendo would tear recklessly through
the matted jungle, followed by his slapping, stumbling companions,
until the maddened insects gave up the chase.Frequently they
walked into huge ant nests before they realized it, sometimes the
great _tucanderas_, so ferociously poisonous."Ah, senores,"
commented Rosendo, as he once stopped to point out the marvelous
roadway cut by these insects for miles straight through the jungle,
"in the days of the Spaniards the cruel taskmasters would often tie
the weak and sick slaves to trees in the depths of the forest and
let these great ants devour them alive!Senores, you can never know
the terrible crimes committed by the Spaniards!"murmured Harris, eying Carmen furtively.But she knew, though she voiced it not, that the Spaniard had never
known the Christ.Night was spent on the summit of the divide.Then, without further
respite, Rosendo urged the descent.Down through ravines and gullies;
over monster bowlders; waist deep through streams; down the sheer
sides of gorges on natural ladders formed by the hanging _mora_
vines; skirting cliffs by the aid of tangled and interlaced roots
of rank, wet vegetation; and then down again into river bottoms,
where the tenacious mud challenged their every step, and the streams
became an interminable morass, through which passage was possible
only by jumping from root to root, where the gnarled feeders of the
great trees projected above the bottomless ooze.The persecution
of the _jejenes_ became diabolical.At dawn and sunset the raucous
bellow of the red-roarer monkeys made the air hideous.The
flickering lights of the forest became dismally depressing.The men
grew morose and sullen.Reed and Harris quarreled with each other on
the slightest provocation.Then, to increase their misery, came the rain.It fell upon them in
the river bottoms in fierce, driving gusts; then in sheets that
blotted out the forest and wet their very souls.The mountains roared and trembled with the hideous
cannonade of thunder.The jungle-matted hills ran with the flood.An
unvaried pall of vapor hung over the steaming ground, through which
uncanny, phantasmagoric shapes peered at the struggling little band.Again the sun burst forth, and a fiery vapor seethed above the moist
earth.The reek of their damp clothing and the acrid odor of the wet
soil increased the enervation of their hard travel.Again and again
the peevish Harris accused Rosendo of having lost the way.The old man
patiently bore the abuse.Reed chided Harris, and at length quarreled
violently with him, although his own apprehension waxed continually
greater.Hour after hour she toiled along,
floundering through the bogs, fording the deeper streams on Rosendo's
broad back, whispering softly to him at times, often seizing and
pressing his great horny hand, but holding her peace.In vain at
evening, when gathered about the damp, smudging firewood, Harris would
bring up to her the causes of her flight.In vain he would accuse the
unfortunate Alcalde, the Bishop, the soldiers.Carmen refused to lend
ear to it, or to see in it anything more than a varied expression of
the human mind.She
saw, not persons, not things, but expressions of thought in the
phenomena which had combined to urge her out of her former environment
and cast her into the trackless jungle.At length, one day, when it seemed to the exhausted travelers that
human endurance could stand no more, Rosendo, who had long been
straining his ears in the direction straight ahead, announced that the
singing noise which floated to them as they descended a low hill and
plunged into a thicket of tall lush grass, undoubtedly came from the
river Tigui.Another hour of straining and plunging through the dense
growth followed; and then, with a final effort, which manifested in a
sort of frenzied rush, the little band emerged suddenly upon the east
bank of the crystal stream, glittering and shimmering in the bright
morning sun as it sang and rippled on its solitary way through the
great jungle.The men threw off their packs and sprawled full length upon the
ground."La Colorado," he said, indicating what the Americans at length made
out to be a frame house, looming above the high grass."And there,"
pointing to the north, "is _Pozo Cayman_, where the trail begins that
leads to La Libertad."That night, as they lay on the rough board floor of the house at La
Colorado, Rosendo told them the story of the misguided Frenchmen who,
years before, had penetrated this wild region, located a barren quartz
vein, then floated a company and begun developments.The soil was fertile; the undeveloped country
ceaselessly rich in every resource, the water pure and sparkling, and
abounding in fish.The climate, too, was moderate and agreeable.It
seemed to the foreigners a terrestrial paradise.It crept out of the jungle like a thief in the night.One by one the Frenchmen fell sick and died.He remained to protect the
company's property.But he, too, fell a victim to the plague.One day,
as he lay burning upon his bed, he called feebly to his one remaining
servant, the native cook, to bring him the little package of quinine.She hastened to comply; but, alas!she brought the packet of
strychnine instead, and soon he, too, had joined his companions in
that unknown country which awaits us all.The old woman fled in
terror; and the evil spirits descended upon the place.They haunt it
yet, and no man approaches it but with trembling.Reed and Harris listened to the weird story with strange sensations.The clouds above had broken, and the late moon streamed through the
night vapor, and poured through the bamboo walls of the house.The
giant frogs in the nearby creek awoke, and through the long night
croaked their mournful plaint in a weird minor cadence that seemed to
the awed Americans to voice to the shimmering moon the countless
wrongs of the primitive Indians, who, centuries before, had roamed
this marvelous land in happy freedom, until the Spaniard descended
like a dark cloud and, with rack and stake, fastened his blighting
religion upon them.A day's rest at La Colorado sufficed to revive the spirits of the
party and prepare them for the additional eight or ten hour journey
over boggy morass and steep hill to La Libertad.For this trip Rosendo
would take only the Americans and Carmen.The _cargadores_ were not to
know the nature of this expedition, which, Rosendo announced, was
undertaken that the Americans might explore for two days the region
around the upper Tigui.The men received this explanation with grunts
of satisfaction.Trembling with suppressed excitement, oblivious now of fatigue,
hunger, or hardship, Reed and Harris followed the old man that day
over the ancient, obliterated trail to the forgotten mine of Don
Ignacio de Rincon.They experienced all the sensations of those who
find themselves at last on the course that leads to buried treasure.To Harris, the romance attaching to the expedition obliterated all
other considerations.But Reed was busy with the practical end of it,
with costs, with the problems of supplies, of transportation, and
trail.Carmen saw but one vision, the man in far-off Simiti, whose
ancestor once owned the great mine which lay just ahead of them.When night fell, the four stood, silent and wondering, at the mouth of
the crumbling tunnel, where lay a rusted shovel bearing the scarce
distinguishable inscription, "I de R."*       *       *       *       *

Two weeks later a group of natives, sitting at a feast of baked
alligator tail, at the mouth of the Amaceri, near the dirty,
straggling riverine town of Llano, rose in astonishment as they saw
issuing from the clayey, wallowing Guamoco trail a staggering band of
travelers, among them two foreigners, whose clothes were in shreds and
whose beards and unkempt hair were caked with yellow mud.With them
came a young girl, lightly clad and wearing torn rope _alpargates_ on
her bare feet.From the
neighboring town floated a brawling bedlam of human voices.It was
Sunday, and the villagers were celebrating a religious _fiesta_."_Compadres_," said Rosendo, approaching the half-intoxicated group.One of the group, his mouth too full to speak, pointed in expressive
pantomime up-stream.Rosendo murmured a fervent "_Loado sea Dios_,"
and sank upon the ground."It will be down to-morrow--to-day, perhaps," gurgled another of the
rapidly recovering feasters, his eyes roving from one member to
another of the weird-looking little band.exclaimed Harris, as he squatted upon the damp ground
and mopped his muddy brow."I'm a salamander for heat, that's
certain!""Senor," said Rosendo, addressing Reed, "it would be well to pay the
men at once, for the boat may appear at any time, and it will not wait
long."While the curious group from the village crowded about and eagerly
watched the proceedings, Reed unstrapped his pack and drew out a bundle
of Colombian bills, with which he began to pay the _cargadores_,
according to the reckoning which Rosendo had kept.As the last man,
with a grunt of satisfaction, received his money, Harris exclaimed:
"And to think, one good American dollar is worth a bushel of that paper
stuff!"The words were scarcely out of his mouth when a shrill whistle came
echoing down the river.A cloud of smoke above the distant treetops
heralded the approach of the steamer.The little party had escaped a
wait of a month in the drenching heat of Llano by the narrow margin of
an hour.Rosendo hastened to Reed and drew him aside.He tried to speak, but
words failed him."I understand, my friend," he
said gently.My wife
and I will care for the girl until we hear from you.And we will keep
in touch with you, although it will take two months for a letter to
reach us and our reply to get back again to Simiti.The development
company will be formed at once.Within six months you may expect to
see the work started.It is your fortune--and the girl's.""Padre, I am coming back to you--yes?""_Cierto, chiquita_!"The old man would not permit himself to say
more.The girl had known for some time that he was not to accompany
her to the States, and that she should not see Ana in Cartagena.To
this she had at length accustomed herself.In a few minutes the lumbering boat had swung around and thrown out
its gang plank.A hurried embrace; a struggle with rushing tears;
another shriek from the boat whistle; and the Americans, with Carmen
standing mute and motionless between them, looked back at the fading
group on shore, where Rosendo's tall figure stood silhouetted
against the green background of the forest.For a moment he held his
arm extended toward them.Carmen knew, as she looked at the
great-hearted man for the last time, that his benediction was
following her--following her into that new world into which he might
not enter.*       *       *       *       *

Reed lifted the silent, wondering, big-eyed girl from the dinkey
train which pulled into Cartagena from Calamar ten days later, and
took her to the Hotel Mariana, where his anxious, fretting wife
awaited.Their boat had hung on a hidden bar in the Cauca river
for four interminable, torturing days.CHAPTER 39


On the day that Carmen arrived in Cartagena, Rosendo staggered down
the Guamoco trail into Simiti.On that same momentous day the flames
of war again flared up throughout the country.The Simiti episode, in
which the President had interfered, brought Congress to the necessity
of action.A few days of fiery debate followed; then the noxious
measure was taken from the table and hastily enacted into a law.But news travels slowly in Latin America, and some time was required
for this act of Congress to become generally known.The delay saw
Carmen through the jungle and down to the coast.There Reed lost no
time in transacting what business still remained for him in Cartagena,
and securing transportation for his party to New York.Jose, the shadow of his former self, clung pitiably to Rosendo's hand,
imploring the constant repetition of the old man's narrative.Then
came Juan, flying to the door.He had seen and talked with the
returned _cargadores_.Neither Jose nor Rosendo could
calm him.At length it seemed wise to them both to tell him that she
had gone to the States with the Americans, and would return to Simiti
no more.He gathered groups of companions about him and talked to them
excitedly.Then, evidently acting on
the advice of some cooler head, he rushed to his canoe and put off
across the lake toward the _cano_.But when he did, the town knew that he had been to Bodega Central, and
that the country was aflame with war.*       *       *       *       *

Reed's wife had not received Carmen in an amiable frame of mind."For
heaven's sake, Charles," she had cried, turning from his embrace to
look at the wondering girl who stood behind him, "what have you
here?""Oh, that," he laughingly replied, "is only a little Indian I lassoed
back in the jungle."And, leaving the girl to the not very tender
graces of his wife, he hurried out to arrange for the return voyage.At noon, when Harris appeared at Reed's room, Carmen rushed to him and
begged to be taken for a stroll through the town.Yielding to her
husband's insistence, Mrs.Reed had outfitted the girl, so that she
presented a more civilized appearance.At first Carmen had been
delighted with her new clothes.They were such, cheap as they were, as
she had never seen in Simiti.But the shoes--"Ah, senora," she
pleaded, "do not make me wear them, they are so tight!She was beginning her education in the conventions
and trammels of civilization.As Carmen and Harris stood that afternoon in the public square, while
the girl gazed enraptured at an equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar, a
ragged little urchin approached and begged them to buy an afternoon
paper.Harris humored him and bade Carmen ask him his name."Rincon," the lad answered, drawing himself up proudly."In the Calle Lozano," he replied, wondering why these people seemed
interested in him."Ask him who his father
is," suggested the latter."I do not know," replied the little fellow, shaking his head.He lives far away, up the great river, so Tia Catalina says."Come with me to your home,"
she said, taking his hand.The boy led them willingly through the winding streets to the little
upper room where, years before, he had first seen the light."Tia Catalina," he cried to the shabby woman who rose in amazement as
the visitors entered, "see, some strangers!"Carmen lost no time, but went at once to the heart of her question."The little fellow's father--he is a Rincon?And--he lives up the
great river?"The woman eyed her suspiciously for some moments without replying."Yes, senorita," he said eagerly, "in
Simiti.And his name--I am named for him--it is Jose.And I am going
to visit him some day.Tia Catalina said I should, no, Tia?"Harris fumbled in his pocket and drew out some money, which he handed
to the woman.Her eyes lighted, and a cavernous smile spread over her
wrinkled face."_Ah, gracias, senor_," she murmured, bending over his hand; "we need
it.The boy's father has sent us but little of late."Carmen's heart was fluttering wildly."Tell me," she said in a cold
voice, "the boy's father is Padre Jose de Rincon, of Simiti?We have just come from Simiti, and have seen him.We are leaving to-morrow for the States.""Yes, senorita," replied the woman in a thin, cracking voice, now
completely disarmed of her suspicion."The little fellow was born here
some seven years ago.But the good Padre has sent
us money ever since to care for him, until of late.Senorita, why is
it, think you, that he sends us so little now?""I--do--not--know," murmured Carmen abstractedly, scarce hearing the
woman.She bent over him and looked long
and wistfully into his eyes.He was a bright, handsome little fellow;
and though her heart was crushed, she took him into it.Swallowing the
lump which had come into her throat, she drew him to the window and
sat down, holding him before her."Your father--I know him--well.But--I did not
know--I never knew that he had a son.""Tia Catalina says he is a fine man," proudly answered the boy."And she wants me to be a priest, too.But I am going to be a
bull-fighter.""It is true, senorita," interposed the woman."We cannot keep him
from the _arena_ now.He hangs about it all day, and about the
slaughter-house.We can hardly drag him back to his meals.What
can we do, senorita?But," with a touch of pride as she looked at him,
"if he becomes a bull-fighter, he will be the best of them all!"Her question carried an appeal which
came from the depths of her soul."Senora, is there no doubt--no doubt
that Padre Rincon is the father of the boy?"The lad's mother died in the good Padre's
arms.She would not say positively who was the boy's father.We
thought at first--it was some one else.Marcelena insisted on it to
her dying day.But now--now we know that it was Padre Jose.And he was
sent to Simiti for it.But--ah, senorita, the little mother was so
beautiful, and so good!She--but, senorita, you are not leaving so
soon?""Yes, my good senora," she said wearily."We must
now return to the hotel.But--here is more money for the boy.And,
senora, when I reach the States I will send you money every month for
him.""Come," she said simply, "I have seen enough
of the city."*       *       *       *       *

At noon the next day a message from Bodega Central was put into the
hand of the acting-Bishop of Cartagena, as he sat in his study,
wrapped in the contemplation of certain papers before him.Hostilities
had begun along the Magdalena river the day before.The gates of
Cartagena were to be barricaded that day, for a boatload of rebels was
about to leave Barranquilla to storm the city and seize, if possible,
the customs.When he had read the message he uttered an exclamation.Had not the Sister Superior of the Convent of Our Lady reported the
arrival of the daughter of Rosendo Ariza some days before?He seized
his hat and left the room.Hastening to the Department of Police, he had a short interview with
the chief.Then that official despatched policemen to the office of
the steamship company, and to the dock.Their orders were to arrest
two Americans who were abducting a young girl.They returned a half
hour later with sheepish faces."Your Excellency," they announced to
their chief, "the vessel sailed from the port an hour ago, with the
Americans and the girl aboard."The announcement aroused in Wenceslas the fury of a tiger.Exacerbation
succeeded surprise; and that in turn gave way to a maddening thirst for
sanguinary vengeance.He hastened out and despatched a telegraphic
message to Bogota.Then he returned to his study to await its effect.Two days later a river steamer, impressed by the federal authorities,
stopped at the mouth of the Boque, and a squad of soldiers marched
over the unfrequented trail to Simiti, where they arrived as night
fell.Their orders were to take into custody the priest, Jose de
Rincon, who was accused of complicity in the recent plot to overthrow
the existing government.At the same time, on a vessel plowing its way into the North, a young
girl, awkwardly wearing her ill-fitting garments, hung over the rail
and gazed wistfully back at the Southern Cross.The tourists who saw
her heterogeneous attire laughed.But when they looked into her
beautiful, sad face their mirth died, and a tender pity stirred their
hearts.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The blanket of wet fog which had hung over the harbor with such
exasperating tenacity lifted suddenly, late in the raw fall afternoon,
and revealed to the wondering eyes of the girl who stood alone at the
rail of the _Joachim_ a confusion of mountainous shadows, studded with
myriad points of light which glittered and shimmered beneath the gray
pall.Across the heaving waters came the dull, ominous breathing of
the metropolis.Clouds of heavy, black smoke wreathed about the bay.Through it shrieking water craft darted and wriggled in endless
confusion.For two days the port of New York had been a bedlam of raw
sound, as the great sirens of the motionless vessels roared their
raucous warnings through the impenetrable veil which enveloped them.Their noise had become acute torture to the impatient tourists, and
added bewilderment to the girl.The transition from the primitive simplicity of her tropical home had
not been one of easy gradation, but a precipitate plunge.The
convulsion which ensued from the culmination of events long gathering
about little Simiti had hurled her through the forest, down the
scalding river, and out upon the tossing ocean with such swiftness
that, as she now stood at the portal of a new world, she seemed to be
wandering through the mazes of an intricate dream.During the ocean
voyage she had kept aloof from the other passengers, partly because of
embarrassment, partly because of the dull pain at her heart as she
gazed, day after day, at the two visions which floated always before
her: one, the haggard face of the priest, when she tore herself from
his arms in far-off Simiti; the other, that of the dark-faced,
white-haired old man who stood on the clayey river bank at wretched
Llano and watched her, with eager, straining eyes, until the winding
stream hid her from his earthly sight--forever.She wondered dully now
why she had left them, why she had so easily yielded to the influences
which had caused the separation.They might have fled to the jungle
and lived there in safety and seclusion.The malign influences which
beset them all in Simiti never could have reached them in the
trackless forest.And yet, she knew that had not Rosendo and Jose held
out to her, almost to the last moment, assurances of a speedy reunion,
she would not have yielded to the pressure which they had exerted, and
to the allurements of life in the wonderful country to which they had
sent her.Her embarrassment on the boat was due largely to a sense of
awkwardness in the presence of women who, to her provincial sight,
seemed visions of beauty.To be sure, the priest had often shown her
pictures of the women of the outside world, and she had some idea of
their dress.But that such a vast difference existed between the
illustrations and the actualities, she had never for a moment
imagined.Their gowns, their jewels, their coiffures held her in
open-mouthed marvel, until Mrs.Reed, herself annoyed and embarrassed,
remanded her to her cabin and bade her learn the impropriety of such
manners.Nor had the conduct of this lady throughout the voyage conduced to
Carmen's happiness.Reed showed plainly that the girl was an
awkward embarrassment to her; that she was tolerated because of
reasons which pertained solely to her husband's business; and she took
pains to impress upon her fellow-travelers that, in view of the
perplexing servant problem, this unmannered creature was being taken
to the States to be trained as a maid, though, heaven knew!the
training would be arduous, and the result uncertain.Reed, though measurably kind, gave Carmen scant attention.Harris
alone saved the girl from almost complete neglect.He walked the deck
with her, regardless of the smiles of the other passengers.He taught
her to play shuffle-board, checkers, and simple card games.He
conducted her over the boat and explained the intricate machinery and
the numberless wonders of the great craft.He sat with her out on the
deck at night and told her marvelous stories of his experiences in
frontier camps.And at the table he insisted that she occupy the seat
next to him, despite the protestations of the chief steward, who would
have placed her apart with the servants.Carmen said little, but she clung to the man with an appeal which,
though mute, he nevertheless understood.At Kingston he took her on a
drive through the town, and bought post cards for her to send back to
Jose and Rosendo.It consoled her immeasurably when he glowingly
recounted the pleasure her loved ones would experience on receiving
these cards; and thereafter the girl daily devoted hours to the
preparation of additional ones to be posted in New York.The lifting of the fog was the signal for a race among the stalled
craft to gain the harbor entrance.The enforced retention of the
vessels in the bay had resulted in much confusion in docking, and the
_Joachim_ was assigned to a pier not her own.The captain grumbled,
but had no choice.At the pier opposite there docked a huge liner from
Havre; and the two boats poured their swarming human freight into the
same shed.When the gang plank dropped, Harris took charge of Carmen,
while Reed and his wife preceded them ashore, the latter giving a
little scream of delight as she spied her sister and some friends with
a profusion of flowers awaiting her on the pier.She rushed joyfully
into their arms, while Reed hastened to his equipage with a customs
officer.But as Harris and the bewildered Carmen pushed into the great crowd in
the shed, the absent-minded man suddenly remembered that he had left a
bundle of Panama hats underneath his bunk.Dropping the girl's hand,
the impetuous fellow tore back up the gang plank and dived into the
boat.For a moment Carmen, stood in confusion, bracing herself against
the swarming multitude, and clinging tenaciously to the small,
paper-wrapped bundle which she carried.But the eager, belated crowd almost swept her off her
feet, and she turned again, drifting slowly with it toward the
distant exit.As she moved uncertainly, struggling the while to
prevent being crushed against the wall, she felt some one grasp her
hand.sounded a gentle voice close to her ear.Come, they are waiting for
us up ahead."It was a woman, comely of feature,
and strikingly well dressed.The
anxious fears of a moment before vanished.Reed and the others are waiting for us.The automobiles came for you all; but I presume the
others have gone by this time.However, you and I will follow in mine.the girl asked eagerly, as the woman forced a way for them
through the mass of humanity."Did he write to you--from Simiti?"He said
your name was--"

"Carmen," interrupted the girl, with a great surge of gladness, for
here was one woman who did not avoid her.cried Carmen, suddenly stopping as she remembered.He knows where to find the
automobiles.I will leave word with the pier-master to tell him."By this time they had wormed their way clear of the crowd and gained
the street.The woman, still retaining Carmen's hand, went directly to
a waiting automobile and pushed the unresisting girl through the open
door.Carmen had never seen a conveyance like this, and her thought
was instantly absorbed.And
then, sinking into the luxurious cushions, she fell to speculating as
to how the thing was moved.As the chauffeur reached back to close the door a policeman, who had
been eying the party since they came out of the shed, stepped up and
laid a hand on the car."Er--little girl," he said, looking in and addressing Carmen,
"_you--you know this lady, do you_?""Yes," replied Carmen, looking up confidently into the woman's smiling
face.She thought his blue uniform
and shining buttons and star gorgeously beautiful.Suspicion lurked in his eyes as
he looked at the woman and then back again at the girl."She is a little girl who came up from the South with my nephew, Mr.I
will give you my card, if you wish."The chauffeur, too, as he got out and
leisurely examined his engine, served further to disarm suspicion.The
officer raised up and removed his hand from the machine.The chauffeur
slowly mounted the box and threw on his lever.As the car moved gently
into the night the officer glanced at its number.What's a fellow going to do in a case like this, I'd like to know--go
with 'em?"Some minutes later, Harris, wild and disheveled, followed by Reed and
his party, emerged hurriedly into the street.asked the officer, planting himself in front
of Harris, and becoming vaguely apprehensive.sputtered Harris, his eyes protruding and his long arms pawing
the air."Girl--so high--funny dress--big straw hat!Aunt took her just now in an auto!"For a moment they all stood silent, big-eyed and gaping.The
girl came up from South America with me.Describe the woman--"

"Reed!"cried the policeman excitedly, his eyes lighting.cried the distracted Harris,
menacing the confused officer.Night had fallen, and a curious crowd was gathering around the
excited, noisy group.Reed quickly signaled a taxicab and hustled the
bewildered officer into it."You, Harris, get the women folks home,
and wait for me!I'll go to central with this officer and report the
case!""I'm going to visit every dance hall
and dive in this bloomin' town before I go home!And you, you blithering idiot," shaking a fist at the
officer, "you're going to lose your star for this!"Meantime, the car, in which Carmen lay deep in the soft cushions, sped
through the dusk like a fell spirit.A confused jumble of shadows flew
past, and strange, unfamiliar noises rose from the animated streets.The lights shimmered on the moist glass.The girl
ceased trying to read any meaning in it.It all fused into a blur; and
she closed her eyes and gave herself up to the novel sensations
stimulated by her first ride in a carriage propelled--she knew not
how.At length came a creaking, a soft, skidding motion, and the big car
rolled up against a curb and stopped."We are home now," said the woman softly, as she descended and again
took Carmen's hand.They hurriedly mounted the white stone steps of a
tall, gloomy building and entered a door that seemed to open
noiselessly at their approach.A glare of light burst upon the
blinking eyes of the girl.A <DW64> woman softly closed the door after
them.With a wondering glance, Carmen looked about her.In the room at
her right she caught a glimpse of women--beautiful, they seemed to
her--clad in loose, low-cut, gaily  gowns.There were men
there, too; and some one sat at a piano playing sprightly music.She
had seen pianos like that in Cartagena, and on the boat, and they had
seemed to her things bewitched.In the room at the end of the hall men
and women were dancing on a floor that seemed of polished glass.Loud
talk, laughter, and singing floated through the rooms, and the air
was warm and stuffy, heavy with perfume.The odor reminded her of the
roses in her own little garden in Simiti.It was all beautiful,
wonderful, fairy-like.But she had only a moment for this appraisal.Seizing her hand again,
the woman whisked her up the flight of stairs before them and into a
warm, light room.Then, without speaking, she went out and closed the
door, leaving the girl alone.Carmen sank into a great, upholstered rocking chair and tried to grasp
it all as she swayed dreamily back and forth.She
wondered if Harris dwelt in a place of such heavenly beauty; for he
had said that he did not live with Reed.What would the stupid people
of Simiti think could they see her now!She had never dreamed that
such marvels existed in the big world beyond her dreary, dusty, little
home town!Jose had told her much, ah, wonderful things!But how pitifully inadequate now seemed all their stories!She
still wondered what had made that carriage go in which she had come up
from the boat.Would her interest in
La Libertad suffice to buy one?She passed her hand over
the clean, white counterpane of the bed."Oh," she murmured, "how
beautiful!"She went dreamily to the bureau and took up, one by one,
the toilet articles that lay there in neat array.she
murmured, again and again.The
little figure reflected there contrasted so oddly with the gorgeously
beautiful ones she had glimpsed below that she laughed aloud.Then she
went to the window and felt of the soft curtains."It is heaven," she
murmured, facing about and sweeping the room, "just heaven!Oh, how
beautiful even the human mind can be!I never thought it, I never
thought it!"Again she sat down in the big rocker and gave herself up to the charm
of her surroundings.Her glance fell upon a vase of flowers that stood
on a table near another window.She rose and went to them, bending
over to inhale their fragrance.she exclaimed, as she
felt them crackle in her fingers.But she would learn, ere long, that they fittingly symbolized the life
of the great city in which she was now adrift.She began to wonder why the woman did not return.Were
not the Reeds anxious to know of her safe arrival?It was a ball--but so
different from the simple, artless _baile_ of her native town.Stray
snatches of music drifted into the room from the piano below.She went to the door, thinking to open
it a little and listen.She went hastily, instinctively, to a window and raised the
curtain.She remembered suddenly
that prison windows were like that.Terror's clammy hand gripped at her heart.Then she
caught herself--and laughed.she exclaimed, sinking again
into the rocker.At that moment the door opened noiselessly and a woman entered.She
was younger than the one who had met the boat.When she saw the girl
she uttered an exclamation.Carmen glanced down at her odd attire and then smiled up at the woman.The woman laughed, a sharp, unmusical laugh.The dry cosmetic
plastered thick upon her cheeks cracked.She was not beautiful like
the others, thought Carmen.Her cheeks were sunken, and her low-cut
gown revealed great, protruding collarbones."Come," she said
abruptly, "get out of those rags and into something modern."She
opened a closet door and selected a gown from a number hanging there.It was white, and there was a gay ribbon at the waist."It'll have to be pinned up," she commented to herself, holding it out
before her and regarding Carmen critically.she exclaimed, "am I to wear that?The woman returned no answer, but opened a bureau drawer and took from
it several other garments, which she threw upon a chair, together with
the dress."Into the whole lot of 'em," she said sharply, indicating the
garments."And move lively, for supper's waitin' and there'll be
callers soon--gentlemen callers," she added, smiling grimly.The woman stopped
abruptly and stood with arms akimbo, regarding the girl.Carmen gazed
up at her with a smile of happy, trustful assurance.She mentioned Simiti, Padre Jose, and Rosendo.Her
voice quavered a little; but she brightened up and concluded: "And Mr.Reed's Auntie, she met us--that is, me.Oh, isn't she a beautiful
lady!"The woman seemed to be fascinated by the child's gaze.Then, suddenly,
as if something had given way under great strain, she cried: "For
God's sake, don't look at me that way!She dropped into
a chair and continued to stare at the girl."Well, I've told you," replied Carmen."But," she continued, going
quickly to the woman and taking her hand, "you haven't told me your
name yet.And we are going to be such good friends, aren't we?And you are going to tell me all about this beautiful house, and
that wonderful carriage I came here in.Reed will take me out in it every
day!"Then, in a low voice:

"Your mother--is she living?""But my mother, my own real mother,
she died, long, long ago, on the banks of the great river.My father
left her, and she was trying to follow him.Then I was born--"

"The same old story!""I've been there,
girl, and know all about it.I followed the man--but it was my kid
that died!God, if I could have laid my hands on him!And now you have
come here--"

She stopped abruptly and swallowed hard.Carmen gently stole an arm
about her neck."It isn't true," she murmured, laying her soft cheek
against the woman's painted one."No one can desert us or harm us, for
_God is everywhere_.Padre Jose said I had a message for the people up here; and now you
are the first one I've told it to.And if we know that, why, nothing bad can ever happen to us.But you
didn't know it when your husband left you, did you?"Then she looked up into the girl's
deep, wondering eyes and checked herself."Come," she said abruptly,
rising and still holding her hand."We'll go down to supper now as you
are."Carmen's companion led her down the stairs and through the hall to a
brightly lighted room at the rear, where about a long table sat a half
dozen women.There were places for as many more, but they were
unoccupied.The cloth was white, the glass shone, the silver
sparkled.And the women, who glanced up at the girl, were clad in
gowns of such gorgeous hues as to make the child gasp in amazement.Over all hung the warm, perfumed air that she had thought so delicious
when she had first entered the house.The woman led her to a chair next to
the one she herself took.Carmen looked around for the lady who had
met her at the boat.The silence and the steady
scrutiny of the others began to embarrass her."Where--where is
Auntie?"she asked timidly, looking up at her faded attendant.One of the women, who swayed slightly
in her chair, looked up stupidly.A burst of laughter followed this remark, and Carmen sat down
in confusion.asked one of the younger women of Carmen's
attendant.Headache," was the laconic reply."She landed a queen this time, didn't she?"looking admiringly at
Carmen."Gets me, how the old girl does it!"Carmen," replied the girl timidly, looking questioningly about the
room."Carmen Ariza," the child amended, as her big, wondering eyes swept
the group."Where do you hail from,
angel-face?"The girl looked uncomprehendingly at her interlocutor."Tell them where you lived, child," said the woman called Jude in a
low voice."Simiti," replied Carmen, tears choking her words.A
burst of mirth punctuated the question."Long way from Paris, judging by the fashions."Carmen answered in a scarcely audible voice, "South America."Low exclamations of astonishment encircled the table, while the women
sat regarding the girl curiously."But," continued Carmen in a trembling voice, "where is Mrs.Her beautiful face wore
such an expression of mingled fear, uncertainty, and helplessness as
to throw a hush upon the room.she
muttered, "it's a shame!"She looked for a moment uncertainly into the
big, deep eyes of the girl, and then turned and hastily left the
room.The silence which followed was broken by a pallid, painted creature at
the end of the table."What an old devil the Madam is!One look into those eyes
would have been enough for me!""This is only a recruiting
station for the regular army.She'll go over to French Lucy's; and the
Madam will get a round price for the job.""Old Lucy'll get rich off of her!Ames owns
her house, too, doesn't he?"replied Jude, brightening under the stimulus of her
wine."He owns every house in this block, they say.The Madam rolls on the
floor and cusses for a week straight every time she pays hers.But
just the same, if you've ever noticed, the houses that Ames owns are
never raided by the coppers.Ames whacks up with the mayor and the
city hall gang and the chief of police.That means protection, and we
pay for it in high rents.But it's a lot better'n being swooped down
on by the cops every few weeks, ain't it?We know what we're expected
to pay, that way.And we never do when we keep handin' it out to the
cops."And he's got a new
collector, fellow from the Ketchim Realty Company.They're the old
man's agents now for his dive-houses.He can't get anybody else to
handle 'em, so the collector tells me.""Belle Carey's place was pulled last night, I hear," said one of the
women, pushing back her plate and lighting a cigarette."Yes," returned Jude, "and why?Cause the house is owned by
Gannette--swell guy livin' up on Riverside Drive--and he don't divvy
with the city hall.Belle don't pay no such rent as the Madam does--at
least so old Lucy tells me."The half-intoxicated woman down the table, who had stirred their
laughter a few minutes before, now roused up heavily.Caught a pippin for her once--right off
the train--jus' like this li'l hussy.Went to th' depot in a hack.Saw
th' li'l kid comin' an' pretended to faint.Li'l kid run to me an'
asked could she help.Got her to see me safe home--tee!She's
workin' f'r ol' Lucy yet, sound's a dollar."She fixed her bleared eyes upon Carmen and lapsed back into her former
state of sodden stupidity.The policeman's words at the
pier were floating confusedly through her thought.The strange talk of
these women increased the confusion.Another of the women got up hurriedly and left the table."I haven't
the nerve for another sob-scene," she commented as she went out.pleaded Carmen, turning from one to
another.Jude reached out and seized her hand tightly.Then, to Carmen:

"You are in a--a hotel," she said abruptly."Oh--then--then it was a mistake?"The girl turned her great, yearning
eyes upon the woman."Sit down, and finish
your supper," she said harshly, pulling the girl toward the chair.The maudlin woman down the table chuckled thickly.The <DW64> waitress
went quickly out and closed the door.Jude rose, still holding the
girl's hand."Come up stairs with me," she said, leading her away.commented one of the women, when the two had left the
room.But she's housekeeper, and that's part of her job.Jude took the girl into her own room and locked the door.Then she
sank wearily into a chair.she cried, "I'm sick of this--sick
of the whole thing!"It was all a
mistake, and we can go.""Why, you said this was a hotel--"

"Hotel!Carmen gazed at the excited woman with a puzzled expression on her
face."Now listen," said Jude, bracing herself, "I've got something to tell
you.For God's sake, child,
don't look at me that way!"Your face looks as if you had come down from the sky.But if you did,
and if you believe in a God, you had better pray to Him now!"I was afraid--a
little--at first.When we stop and just know that we love
everybody, and that everybody really loves us, why, we can't be afraid
any more, can we?"The woman looked up at the child in blank amazement.That
warped, twisted word conveyed no meaning to her.And God--it was only
a convenient execrative.But--what was it that looked out from that
strange girl's eyes?What
was emerging from those unfathomable depths, twining itself about her
withered heart and expanding her black, shrunken soul?Whence came
that beautiful, white life that she was going to blast?"Look here," she cried sharply, "tell me again all about yourself, and
about your friends and family down south, and what it was that the
Madam said to you!Carmen sat down at her feet, and taking her hand, went again over the
story.As the child talked, the woman's hard eyes widened, and now and
then a big tear rolled down the painted cheek.Her thought began to
stray back, far back, along the wreck-strewn path over which she
herself had come.At last in the dim haze she saw again the little New
England farm, and her father, stern, but honest and respected,
trudging behind the plow.In the cottage she saw her white-haired
mother, every lineament bespeaking her Puritan origin, hovering over
her little household like a benediction.Then night fell, swiftly as
the eagle swoops down upon its prey, and she awoke from a terrible
dream, stained, abandoned, lost--and seared with a foul oath to drag
down to her own level every innocent girl upon whom her hands might
thereafter fall!"And I have just had to know," Carmen concluded, "every minute since I
left Simiti, that God was everywhere, and that He would not let any
harm come to me.But when we really know that, why, the way _always_
opens.For that's prayer, right prayer; the kind that Jesus taught."The woman sat staring at the girl, an expression of utter blankness
upon her pallid face.Oh, yes, she had been taught to pray.Well she remembered, though the memory now cut like a knife, how she
knelt at her beautiful mother's knee and asked the good Father to
bless and protect them all, even to the beloved doll that she hugged
to her little bosom.But God had never heard her petitions, innocent
though she was.And He had let her fall, even with a prayer on her
lips, into the black pit!A loud sound of male voices and a stamping of feet rose from below.The woman sprang to the door and stood listening."It's the boys from
the college!"She turned and stood hesitant for a moment, as if striving to
formulate a plan.A look of fierce determination came into her face.She went to the bureau and took from the drawers several articles,
which she hastily thrust into the pocket of her dress."Now," she said, turning to Carmen and speaking in a low, strained
voice, "you do just as I say.And for God's sake
don't speak!"Leaving the light burning, she stepped quickly out with Carmen and
locked the door after her.Then, bidding the girl wait, she slipped
softly down the hall and locked the door of the room to which the girl
had first been taken.Laughter and music floated up from below, mingled with the clink of
glasses.The air was heavy with perfume and tobacco smoke.A door near
them opened, and a sound of voices issued.The woman pulled Carmen
into a closet until the hall was again quiet.Then she hurried on to
another door which she entered, dragging the girl with her.Groping through the darkness, she reached a
window, across which stood a hinged iron grating, secured with a
padlock.The woman fumbled among her keys and unfastened this.Swinging it wide, and opening the window beyond, she bade the girl
precede her cautiously."It's a fire-escape," she explained briefly.She reached through the
window grating and fastened the padlock; then closed the window; and
quickly descended with the girl to the ground below.Pausing a moment to get her breath, she seized Carmen's hand and crept
swiftly around the big house and into a dark alley.There she stopped
to throw over her shoulders a light shawl which she had taken from the
bureau.Their course lay through the muddy alley for several blocks.When they
emerged they were in a dimly lighted cross street.The air was chill,
and the thinly clad woman shivered.Carmen, fresh from the tropics,
felt the contrast keenly.A few moments' rapid walking down the street
brought them to a large building of yellow brick, surrounded by a high
board fence.The woman unfastened the gate and hurried up to the door,
over which, by the feeble light of the street lamp, Carmen read, "The
Little Sisters of the Poor."A black-robed woman admitted them and went to summon the Sister
Superior.Carmen marveled at her strange attire.A moment later they
were silently ushered into an adjoining room, where a tall woman,
similarly dressed, awaited them."Sister," said Jude excitedly, "here's a little kid--you got to care
for her until she finds her friends!"The Sister Superior instantly divined the status of the woman."Let
the child wait here a moment," she said, "and you come with me and
tell your story.It would be better that she should not hear."Carmen was drowsing in her
chair."She's chock full of religion," the woman was saying."But you," the Sister replied, "what will you do?"Then you will stay here until--"

"No, no!I have friends--others like myself--I will go to them.I--I
couldn't stay here--with her," nodding toward the girl."But--you will
take care of her?""Surely," returned the Sister in a calm voice.Then she turned abruptly and went swiftly out into the chill night."Come," said the Sister to Carmen, extending a hand.CHAPTER 2


Carmen was astir next morning long before the rising-bell sounded its
shrill summons through the long corridors.When she opened her eyes
she gazed at the ceiling above in perplexity.She still seemed to feel
the tossing motion of the boat, and half believed the bell to be the
call to the table, where she should again hear the cheery voice of
Harris and meet the tolerant smile of Mrs.Then a rush of
memories swept her, and her heart went down in the flood.She was
alone in a great foreign city!She turned her face to the pillow, and
for a moment a sob shook her.Then she reached under the pillow and
drew out the little Bible, which she had taken from her bundle and
placed there when the Sister left her the night before.The book fell
open to Isaiah, and she read aloud:

  "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine
  hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the
  people, for a light of the Gentiles.""That means me," she said
firmly."Padre Jose said I had a message for the world; and now I
am to tell it to these people up here.That means, He has called me to do _right thinking_.And I am to tell these people how to think right.Suddenly her thought reverted to Cartagena, and to the sturdy little
lad who had so proudly claimed the name of Rincon.Then she burst into tears and threw herself back upon the
bed."I must think only God's thoughts,"
she said, struggling to her feet and checking her grief."If it is
right for the little boy to be his son, then I must want it to be so.I _must_ want only the right--I have _got_ to want it!And if it is
not right now, then God will make it so.It is all in His hands, and I
must not think of it any more, unless I think right thoughts."She dressed herself quickly, but did not put on the shoes."I simply
can not wear these things," she mourned, looking at them dubiously;
"and I do not believe the woman will make me.I wonder why the other
woman called her Sister.Why did she wear that ugly black bonnet?And
why was I hurried away from that hotel?It was so much pleasanter
there, so bright and warm; and here it is so cold."She shivered as
she buttoned her thin dress."But," she continued, "I have got to go
out now and find Mr.Harris--I have just _got_ to find
them--and to-day!But, oh, this city is so much larger than Simiti!"She shook her head in perplexity as she put the Bible back again in
the bundle, where lay the title papers to La Libertad and her mother's
little locket, which Rosendo had given her that last morning in
Simiti.The latter she drew out and regarded wistfully for some
moments."I haven't any father or mother but God," she murmured."But
He is both father and mother to me now."With a little sigh she tied
up the bundle again.Holding it in one hand and carrying the much
despised shoes in the other, she left the cheerless room and started
down the long, cold hall.When she reached the stairway leading to the floor below she stopped
abruptly."I have been
thinking only of myself.What is it that the Bible says?--'And I will bring them by a way
that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not
known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things
straight.'And Padre Jose said he would
remember it, too."Again she choked back the tears which surged up at the remembrance of
the priest, and, bracing herself, hastily descended the stairs,
murmuring at every step, "God is everywhere--right here!"At the far end of the lower hall she saw, through an open door, a
number of elderly people sitting at long tables.When she reached the door, she stopped and peered
curiously within.A murmur of astonishment rose from the inmates
when they caught sight of the quaint object in the doorway, standing
uncertainly, with her shoes in one hand, the awkwardly tied bundle in
the other, and garbed in the chaotic attire so hastily procured for
her in Cartagena.A Sister came quickly forward and, taking the girl's hand, led her
into a smaller adjoining room, where sat the Sister Superior at
breakfast.The latter greeted the child gently and bade her be seated
at the table.Carmen dropped into a chair and sat staring in naive
wonder."Well," began the Sister at length, "eat your breakfast quickly.This
is Sunday, you know, and Mass will be said in the chapel in half an
hour.But you are with friends
here, little girl.Carmen quickly recovered her spirits, and her nimble tongue its wonted
flexibility.Without further invitation or preface she entered at once
upon a lively description of her wonderful journey through the jungle,
the subsequent ocean voyage, and the mishap at the pier, and concluded
with the cryptical remark: "And, you know, Senora, it is all just as
Padre Jose said, only a series of states of consciousness, after
all!"The Sister stared blankly at the beaming child.What manner of being
was this that had been so strangely wafted into these sacred precincts
on the night breeze!The abandoned woman who had brought her there,
the Sister remembered, had dropped an equally cryptical remark--"She's
chock full of religion."But gratitude quickly mastered her wonder, and the woman, pondering
the child's dramatic recital, murmured a sincere, "The Virgin be
praised!""Oh," said Carmen, looking up quickly as she caught the words, "you
people up here talk just like those in Simiti.But Padre Jose said you
didn't know, either.You ought to, though, for you have had so many
more ad--advantages than we have.Senora, there are many big, clumsy
words in the English language, aren't there?We used to speak it all the time during the
last years we were together.He said it seemed easier to talk about
God in that language than in any other."And who is this
Jose that you talk so much about?""He--taught me--in Simiti."Well," replied the Sister warmly, "he seems to have taught you queer
things!"returned Carmen quickly, "he just taught me the truth.He
didn't tell me about the queer things in the world, for he said they
were not real."Again the Sister stared at the girl in dumb amazement.But the child's
thought had strayed to other topics.she
exclaimed, shivering and drawing her dress about her."I guess I'll
have to put on these shoes to keep my feet warm.""Didn't you
wear shoes in your country?""No," replied Carmen, tugging and straining at the shoes; "I didn't
wear much of anything, it was so warm.Oh, it is beautiful down there,
Senora, so beautiful and warm in Simiti!"She sighed, and her eyes
filled with tears.But she brushed them away and smiled bravely up at
the Sister."I've come here because it is right," she said with a firm
nod of her head."Padre Jose said I had a message for you.He said you
didn't know much about God up here.Why, I don't know much of anything
else!"She laughed a happy little laugh as she said this.Then she
went on briskly:

"You know, Senora, Padre Jose isn't really a priest.But he said he
had to stay in the Church in order to teach me.I am sure he just thought wrong about it.But, anyway,
he will not have to be a priest any more, now that I have gone, will
he?You know, Don Jorge said priests were a bad lot; but that isn't
so, for there are many good priests, aren't there?Why, Senora," she exclaimed,
suddenly remembering the Sister's previous injunction, "is this a
church?You said there would be Mass in the chapel--"

"No," replied the Sister, still studying the girl attentively, while
her manner became more severe; "this is a home for old people, a
charitable institution.""Oh," replied Carmen, with a very vague idea of what that meant."Well," her face alight and her eyes dancing, "I don't belong here
then, do I?I am never going to be old," she meditated.The Bible says we
are made in His image and likeness.Well, if that is so, how can we
ever grow old?Just think of God hobbling around in heaven with a cane
and saying: 'Well, I'm getting old now!We wouldn't grow old and die if it wasn't for our wrong
way of thinking, would we?When we think His thoughts, why, we will be
like Him.Padre Jose says this, and he knows it is
true--only, he seems to have a hard time proving it.But, Senora, we
have all got to prove it, some time, every one of us.And then there
will not be any places like this for old people--people who still
believe that two and two are seven, you know.The woman looked at her blankly; but the girl rambled on."Padre Jose
sometimes talked of the charitable institutions out in the world, and
he always said that charity was a crime against the people.And he was
right, for that is just the way Jesus looked at it, isn't it?Jesus
did not give money to beggars, but he did better, he healed them of
the bad state of mind that was making them poor and sick.Jesus, when he taught,
first said a thing, and then he turned right around and proved it.And, why, Senora,
I've had thousands of proofs!"The Sister did not reply; and Carmen, stealing a covert glance at her,
continued:

"You know, Senora, it is just as wicked to be sick and poor as it is
to tell a lie, because being sick and poor is just the ex--the
ex-ter-nal-i-zation of our thought; and such thought is not from God;
and so to hold such thoughts and to believe them real is to believe in
power apart from God.It is having other gods than the one God; and
that is breaking the very first Commandment, isn't it?Yes, it is; and
you can prove it, just as you can prove the principles in mathematics.Senora, do you know anything about mathematics?"The astonished woman made an involuntary sign of negation."Oh, Senora," cried the enthusiastic girl, "the things that Jesus
taught can be proved just as easily as we prove the rules in
mathematics!for they are truth, and all truth can be
demonstrated, you know.You know, Senora, God is everywhere--not only
in heaven, but right here where we are.Heaven, Padre Jose used to say
so often, is only a perfect state of mind; and so it is, isn't it?And when we reflect Him perfectly, why, we
will be in heaven.But," she went on after catching
her breath, "we can't reflect Him as long as we believe evil to be
real and powerful.It is just zero, nothing--"

"I've heard that before," interrupted the woman, recovering somewhat
from her surprise."But I think that before you get out of New York
you will reverse that idea.There's a pretty fair amount of evil here,
and it is quite real, we find.""If it is real, then God made it.It
seems real to you--but that is only because you give it reality in
your consciousness.You believe it real, and so it becomes to you.""Well," said the woman dryly, "on that basis I think the same may be
said of good, too.""No," answered Carmen eagerly, "good is--"

"There," interrupted the Sister coldly, holding up an admonitory hand,
"we are not going to discuss the foolish theological notions which
that fallen priest put into your poor little head.The child looked at the woman in mute protest.It was a new thought, and
one that she would not accept."Senora," she began again, after a brief interval, "Padre Jose is a
good man, even the human Padre Jose.And he is trying to solve his
problem and know God.And he is trying to know himself, not as other
people think they know him, but as God knows him, and as I have always
tried to know him.You have no right to judge him--and, anyway, you
are not judging him, but only your wrong idea of him.And that," she
said softly, "is nothing."She was beginning to feel the spell of
those great brown eyes, that soft, rich voice, and the sparkling
expression of innocence, purity, and calm assurance that bubbled from
those red lips.And she was losing herself in contemplation of the
girl's luxuriant beauty, whose rich profusion her strange, foreign
attire could not disguise."Senora," said Carmen suddenly, "the people on the boat laughed at my
clothes.But I don't think them half as funny as that great black
bonnet you are wearing.I never saw one until I
was brought here."It was said innocently, and with no thought of offense.But the woman
instantly roused from her meditation and assumed an attitude of
severe dignity."And
remember after this that children's manners here are not those of your
country."The girl fell quiet under the rebuke, and the meal ended in silence.As they were rising from the table a cheery voice came from the outer
room, and presently a priest looked in."Good morning, Sister," he cried heartily.He was a young man, apparently still in the
twenties, of athletic build, inclined rather to stoutness, and with a
round, shining face that radiated health and good nature."It is a little
waif," she said in answer to his query, "who strayed in here last
night.""Aha," said the priest, "another derelict!And will you send her to
the orphanage?""I'm afraid if I do the little heretic will corrupt all the other
children," replied the Sister."Father," she continued seriously, "I
want you to examine this child, and then tell me what you think should
be done with her.""No," replied the Sister; "but another priest has gone wrong, and
this," pointing to Carmen, "is the result of his pernicious
teachings.""Very well, Sister," he said in a low voice."I will talk with her
after the service."He seemed suddenly to have lost his cheerfulness,
as he continued to converse with the woman on matters pertaining to
the institution.Carmen, wondering and receptive, took the place assigned to her in the
chapel and sat quietly through the service.She had often seen Jose
celebrate Mass in the rude little church in Simiti, but with no such
elaboration as she witnessed here.Once or twice she joined in the
responses, not with any thought of worship, but rather to give vent,
even if slight, to the impelling desire to hear her own musical voice.She thought as she did so that the priest looked in her direction.She
thought others looked at her attentively at the same time.But they
had all stared at her, for that matter, and she had felt confused and
embarrassed under their searching scrutiny.Yet the old people
attracted her peculiarly.Never had she seen so many at one time.And
never, she thought, had she seen such physical decrepitude and
helplessness.And then she fell to wondering what they were all there
for, and what they got out of the service.Did they believe that thereby their sins were atoned?Did
they believe that that priest was really changing the wafer and wine
into flesh and blood?She recalled much that Jose had told her about
the people up in the States.They were not so different, mentally,
from her own, after all.The people, still gossiping cheerfully,
had prostrated themselves before it.The sermon had been short, for
the old people waxed impatient at long discourses.Then the priest
descended from the pulpit and came to Carmen."Now, little girl," he
said, seating himself beside her, "tell me all about yourself, who you
are, where you come from, and what you have been taught.Carmen smiled up at him; then plunged into
her narrative.It was two hours later when the Sister Superior looked in and saw the
priest and girl still sitting in earnest conversation."But," she heard the priest say, "you tell me that this
Father Jose taught you these things?""He taught me English, and French, and German.And he taught me all I know of history, and of the
world," the girl replied."Yes, yes," the priest went on hurriedly; "but these other things,
these religious and philosophical notions, who taught you these?"The Sister drew closer and strained her ears to hear.The girl looked down as she answered softly, "God."He reached out and laid a hand
on hers."I believe you," he said, in a voice scarcely audible."I
believe you--for we do not teach such things.""Then," she said quizzically,
"you are not really a priest."The Sister's voice rang sternly through the quiet
chapel."The dinner-bell
will ring in a few minutes," continued the Sister, regarding the man
severely."Ah, true," he murmured, hastily glancing at the clock."The time
passed so rapidly--a--a--this girl--"

"Leave the girl to me," replied the Sister coldly."Unless," she
added, "you consider her deranged.Coming from that hot country
suddenly into this cold climate might--"

"No, no," interrupted the priest hastily; "she seems uncommonly strong
mentally.She has some notions that are a--somewhat different from
ours--that is--but I will come and have a further talk with her."He raised his hand in silent benediction, while the Sister bowed her
head stiffly.Then, as if loath to take his eyes from the girl, he
turned and went slowly out.Carmen followed her out into the hall
and down a flight of steps to the kitchen below."Katherine," said the Sister Superior, addressing an elderly,
white-haired Sister who seemed to be in charge of the culinary
department, "put this girl to work.Let her eat with you and sleep in
your room.And see if you can't work some of the foolish notions out
of her head."CHAPTER 3


"Get some o' th' foolish notions out of your head, is it?Och, puir
bairn, wid yer swate face an' that hivenly hair, it's welcome ye air
to yer notions!Ye have talked too brash to the Sister
Superior.But, mind your tongue,
honey.Tell your funny notions to old Katie, an' they'll be safe as
the soul of Saint Patrick; but keep mum before the others, honey.""But, Senora, don't they want to know the truth up here?"There was a
note of appeal in the quavering voice."Now listen, honey; don't call me sich heathen names.I'm no Senora, whativer that may be.And as for wantin' to know the
truth, God bless ye, honey!"They don't, Sen--Sister!""Well, thin, they don't--an' mebby I'm not so far from agreein' wid
ye.But, och, it's dead beat I am, after the Sunday's work!But ye air
a right smart little helper, honey--only, ye don't belong in th'
kitchen.""Sen--I mean, Sister--"

"That's better, honey; ye'll get it in time.""Sister, I've just _got_ to find Mr."No, honey, it's few I know outside these walls.But ye can put up a
bit of a prayer when ye turn in to-night.An' we'd best be makin' for
th' bed, too, darlin', for we've a hard day's work to-morrow."It was Carmen's second night in New York, and as the girl silently
followed the puffing old woman up the several long, dark flights of
stairs to the little, cheerless room under the eaves, it seemed to her
that her brain must fly apart with the pressure of its mental
accumulation.The great building in which she was now sheltered, the
kitchen, with its marvels of equipment, gas stoves, electric lights,
annunciators, and a thousand other equally wonderful appliances which
the human mind has developed for its service and comfort, held her
fascinated, despite her situation, while she swelled with questions
she dared not ask.Notwithstanding the anxiety which she had not
wholly suppressed, her curiosity, naive, eager, and insatiable, rose
mountain high.Sister Katherine had been kind to her, had received her
with open arms, and given her light tasks to perform.And many times
during the long afternoon the old woman had relaxed entirely from her
assumed brusqueness and stooped to lay a large, red hand gently upon
the brown curls, or to imprint a resounding kiss upon the flushed
cheek.Now, as night was settling down over the great, roaring city,
the woman took the homeless waif into her big heart and wrapped her in
a love that, roughly expressed, was yet none the less tender and
sincere."Ye can ask the Virgin, honey, to send ye to yer frinds," said the
woman, as they sat in the gloaming before the window and looked out
over the kindling lights of the city."Not much, I guess, honey," answered the woman frankly."Troth, an'
I've asked her fer iverything in my time, from diamonds to a husband,
an' she landed me in a convint!"You didn't ask in the right way, Sister--"

"Faith, I asked in ivery way I knew how!An' whin I had th' carbuncle
on me neck I yelled at her!Sure she may have answered me prayer, fer
th' whoop I gave busted the carbuncle, an' I got well.Ye nivir kin
tell, honey."But, Sis--I can't call you Sister!"pleaded the girl, going to the
woman and twining her arms about her neck."Och, honey darlin'"--tears started from the old woman's eyes and
rolled down her wrinkled cheeks--"honey darlin', call me Katie, just
old Katie.Och, Holy Virgin, if I could have had a home, an' a
beautiful daughter like you--!"She clasped the girl in her great arms
and held her tightly."Katie, when you pray you must pray knowing that God has already given
you what you need, and that there is nothing that can keep you from
seeing it.""An' so, darlin', if I want
diamonds I must know that I have 'em, is it that, honey?"murmured Carmen, drawing closer, and laying her soft
cheek against the leathery visage of the old woman."Say that again, honey--och, say it again!It's words, darlin', that's
nivir been said to old Katie!""Why, hasn't any one ever been kind to you?"Och, ivirybody's kind to me, honey!But nobody has ivir loved
me--that way.The good Lord made me a fright, honey--ain't ye noticed?An' they told me from th' cradle up I'd nivir
land a man.An' I didn't, honey; they all ran from me--an' so I become
a bride o' th' Church."But, Katie, the face is nothing.Why, your heart is as big--as big as
the whole world!I hadn't been with you an hour before I knew that."Och, darlin'," murmured the woman, "sure th' Virgin be praised fer
sendin' ye to me, a lonely old woman!""It was not the Virgin, Katie, but God who brought me here," said the
girl gently, as she caressed the old Sister's cheek."It's all one, honey; the Virgin's th' Mother o' God.""Troth, child, she has th' same power as God!Don't we pray to her,
an' she prays to th' good God to save us?There is no person or thing that persuades God to be
good to His children.He is
infinite--infinite mind, Katie, and infinite good.Oh, Katie, what
awful things are taught in this world as truth!How little we know of
the great God!And yet how much people pretend they know about Him!But if they only knew--really _knew_, as Jesus did--why, Katie, there
wouldn't be an old person, or a sick or unhappy one in the whole
world!Katie," after a little pause, "I know."Air these more o' yer funny
notions, darlin'?""I suppose they are what the world thinks funny, Katie," answered the
girl.But then,
th' world moves, girlie--even old Katie sees that.Only, the Church
don't move with it.An' old Katie can see that, too.An' so, I'm
thinkin', does Father Waite.""Faith, an' how do ye know it, child?""He talked with me--a long time, this morning.He said God had taught
me what I know."Thin me own suspicions air right; he's out o' tune!Did ye say, girlie dear, that he didn't scold ye fer yer funny
notions?""No, Katie, he said they were right."Thin, lassie dear, things is goin' to happen.An' he's a
good man--troth, they make no better in this world!"Carmen looked out wonderingly over
the city.She yearned to know what it held for her."Katie," she said at length, bending again over the woman, "will you
help me find Mr."Och, lassie--what's your name again?""Carmen," replied the girl, "Carmen Ariza.""Cair-men Aree--now ain't that a name fer ye!An' I'm Scotch-Irish, honey; an' we're both a long
way from th' ol' sod!Lassie dear, tell me about last night.But, no;
begin 'way back.Old Katie's weak in th' head,
girlie, but she may see a way out fer ye.Th' Virgin help ye, puir
bairn!"Midnight boomed from the bell in a neighboring tower when Carmen
finished her story.exclaimed the old Sister, staring at the girl
in amazement."Now do ye let me feel of ye to see that ye air human;
fer only a Saint could go through all that an' live to tell it!An'
the place ye were in last night!Now be Saint Patrick, if I was rich
I'd have Masses said every day fer that Jude who brung ye here!Don't
tell me th' good Lord won't forgive her!"She's a good woman, Katie; and, somehow, I felt sorry for her, but I
don't know why.She has a beautiful home in that hotel--"

"Hotel, is it!But--och, sure, it was a hotel, honey.Only, ye air better off here wi' old Katie."But--unless it's wi' Father
Waite, I don't know what I can do.Ye air in bad with th' Sister
Superior fer yer talk at th' breakfast table.Ye're a fresh little
heathen, honey.An' she's suspicious of Father Waite, too.An' he th' best man on airth!But his doctrine ain't just sound,
sweatheart.There,
honey, lave it to me.But it's got to be done quick, or th' Sister
Superior'll have ye in an orphan asylum, where ye'll stay till ye air
soused in th' doctrine!I can manage to get word to Father Waite
to-morrow, airly.A bit of a word wi'
him'll fix it, lassie dear.An' now, honey swate, off with them funny
clothes and plump into bed.it's all but marnin' now!"A few minutes later the woman turned to the girl who lay so quiet at
her side."Honey," she whispered, "was ye tellin' me awhile back that ye knew
the right way to pray?""Yes, Katie dear," the child murmured."Thin do you pray, lass, an' I'll not trouble the Virgin this night."*       *       *       *       *

"Well, Father, what do you think now?"The Sister Superior looked up
aggressively, as Father Waite slowly entered the room.His head was
bowed, and there was a look of deep earnestness upon his face."I have talked with her again--an hour, or more," he said reflectively."She is a--a remarkable girl, in many ways.""She attracts and repels me, both," she
said.And she appears to be
suffering from religious dementia.It was a compromising question, and the priest weighed his words
carefully before replying."She does--seem to--to have rather--a--rather
unusual--religious views," said he slowly."Would it not be well to have Dr."That we may know what to do with her.If she is mentally unsound she
must not be sent to the orphanage.""She should be taken--a--I mean, we should try to locate her friends.I have already searched the city directory; but, though there are many
Reeds, there are none listed with the initials she gave me as his.I
had thought," he continued hesitatingly, "I had thought of putting her
in charge of the Young Women's Christian Association--"

"Father Waite!"The Sister Superior rose and drew herself up to her
full height."Do you mean to say that you have contemplated delivering
her into the hands of heretics?"she demanded coldly, her tall figure
instinct with the mortal pride of religious superiority."Why, Sister," returned the priest with embarrassment, "would it not
be wise to place her among those whose views harmonize more closely
with hers than ours do?"urged the man, with a gesture of
impatience.The combined weight of all the
centuries of church authority could not make her one--never!I must
take her to those with whom she rightfully belongs."The Sister Superior's eyes narrowed and glittered, and her face grew
dark.I am in charge here, and I
shall report this case to the Bishop!"The futility of his case
seemed to impress him.Taking up his hat, he bowed without speaking
and went out.Outside
the door the man listened until he caught the number she called.His
face grew dark and angry, and his hands clenched a she strode down the
hall.On the stairs that led up from the kitchen stood Sister Katherine."Wait on th' corner--behind the church!The lassie will meet you
there!"Before he could reply the woman had plunged again into the dark
stairway.Stopping at a small closet below, she took out a bundle.Then she hurried to the kitchen and summoned Carmen, who was sitting
at a table peeling potatoes."Troth, lazy lass," she commanded sharply, "do you take the bucket and
mop and begin on the front steps.And mind that ye don't bring me
heavy hand down on ye!Och, lassie darlin'," she added, when she had
drawn the startled girl out of hearing of the others, "give yer old
Katie a kiss, and then be off!Troth, it breaks me heart to see ye
go--but 'twould break yours to stay!Go, lassie darlin', an' don't
fergit old Katie!Here," thrusting the girl's bundle and a dollar bill
into her hands, "an' God bless ye, lass!Ye've won me, heart an' soul!Ye'll find a frind at th' nixt corner!"She
strained the girl again to her breast, then opened the door and
hastily thrust her out into the street.For a moment Carmen stood dazed by the suddenness of it all.She
looked up confusedly at the great, yellow building from which she had
been ejected.Then, grasping her
bundle and the dollar bill, she hurried out through the gate and
started up the street.The man's face was furrowed, and
his body trembled.The girl went up to him with a glad smile.The
priest looked up, and muttered something incoherent under his breath a
she took her hand.He drew some loose change from his pocket, and hailed an approaching
street car."To police headquarters," he replied, "to ask them to help us find
your friends."CHAPTER 4


From the mysterious wastes which lie far out on the ocean, the fog was
again creeping stealthily across the bay and into the throbbing
arteries of the great city.Through half-opened doors and windows it
rolled like smoke, and piled like drifted snow against the mountains
of brick and stone.Caught for a moment on a transient breeze, it
swirled around a towering pile on lower Broadway, and eddied up to the
windows of the Ketchim Realty Company, where it sifted through the
chinks in the loose frames and settled like a pall over the dingy
rooms within.To Philip O. Ketchim, junior member of the firm, it seemed a fitting
external expression of the heavy gloom within his soul.Crumpled into
the chair at the broad table in his private office, with his long,
thin legs stretched out before him, his hands crammed into the pockets
of his trousers, and his bullet-shaped head sunk on his flat chest,
until it seemed as if the hooked nose which graced his hawk-like
visage must be penetrating his breast-bone, the man was the embodiment
of utter dejection.On the littered table, where he had just tossed
it, lay the report of Reed and Harris on the pseudo-mineral properties
of the Molino Company--the "near-mines" in the rocky canon of the
far-off Boque.Near it lay the current number of a Presbyterian
review, wherein the merits of this now moribund project were
advertised in terms whose glitter had attracted swarms of eager,
trusting investors.The firm name of Ketchim Realty Company was something of a misnomer.The company itself was an experiment, whose end had not justified its
inception.It had been launched a few years previously by Douglass
Ketchim to provide business careers for his two sons, James and
Philip.The old gentleman, still hale and vigorous, was one of those
sturdy Englishmen who had caught the infection of '49 and abruptly
severed the ties which bound them to their Kentish homes for the
allurements of the newly discovered El Dorado of western America.Across the death-haunted Isthmus of Panama and up the inhospitable
Pacific coast the indomitable spirit of the young adventurer drove
him, until he reached the golden sands of California.There he toiled
for many years, until Fortune at length smiled upon his quenchless
efforts.Then he tossed aside his rough tools and set out for the less
constricted fields of the East.He invested his money wisely, and in the course of years turned it
several times.He aspired to the hand of a
sister of a railway president, and won it.He educated his sons in the
best colleges of the East, and then sent them to Europe on their
honeymoons.And finally, when the burden of years began to press
noticeably, and the game became less attractive, he retired from
the field of business, cleared off his indebtedness, organized the
Ketchim Realty Company, put its affairs on the best possible basis,
and then committed the unpardonable folly of turning it over to the
unrestricted management of his two sons.At the expiration of a year the old gentleman
hurried back into the harness to save the remnant of his fortune, only
to find it inextricably tied up in lands of dubious value and
questionable promotional schemes.The untangling of the real estate he
immediately took into his own hands.A word in passing regarding these sons, for they typify a form of
parasitical growth, of the fungus variety, which in these days has
battened and waxed noxious on the great stalk of legitimate commercial
enterprise.They were as dissimilar, and each as unlike his father, as
is possible among members of the same family.Both sought, with
diligent consecration, the same goal, money; but employed wholly
different means to gain that end.James, the elder, was a man of ready
wit, a nimble tongue, and a manner which, on occasions when he could
think of any one but himself, was affable and gracious.He was a
scoffer of religion, an open foe of business scruple, and the avowed
champion of every sort of artifice and device employed in ancient,
mediaeval, or modern finance to further his own selfish desires, in
the minimum of time, and at whatever cost to his fellow-man.In his
cups he was a witty, though arrogant, braggart.In his home he was
petulant and childish.Of real business acumen and constructive
wisdom, he had none.He would hew his way to wealth, if need be,
openly defiant of God, man, or the devil.Or he would work in subtler
ways, through deceit, jugglery, or veiled bribe.But he generally wore
his heart on his sleeve; and those who perforce had business relations
with him soon discovered that, though utterly unscrupulous, his
character was continuously revealed through his small conceit, which
caused him so to work as to be seen of men and gain their cheap
plaudits for his sharp, mendacious practices.Philip retained a degree of his father's confidence--which James
wholly lacked--and he spared himself no pains to cultivate it.Though
far less ready of wit than his stubby, bombastic brother, he was a
tenacious plodder, and was for this reason much more likely ultimately
to achieve his sordid purposes.His energy was tireless, and he never
admitted defeat.He never worked openly; he never appeared to have a
decided line of conduct; and no one could ever say what particular
course he intended to pursue.Apparently, he was a man of exemplary
habits; and his mild boast that he knew not the taste of tobacco or
liquor could not be refuted.He was an elder in the Presbyterian
church in the little suburb where he lived, and superintendent of its
Sunday school.His prayers were beautiful expressions of reverent
piety; and his conversation, at all times chaste and modest, announced
him a man of more than ordinary purity of thought and motive.While it
is true that no one could recall any pious deed, any charitable act,
or any conduct based on motives of self-abnegation and brotherly love
performed by him, yet no one could ever point to a single coarse or
mean action emanating from the man.If there was discord in company
affairs, the wanton James always bore the onus.And because of this,
relations between the brothers gradually assumed a condition of
strain, until at length James openly and angrily denounced Philip as a
hypocrite, and refused longer to work with him.Thereupon the milder
Philip offered the other cheek and installed a mediator, in the person
of one Rawlins, a sickly, emaciated, bearded, but loyal Hermes, who
thenceforth performed the multifold functions of pacificator,
go-between, human telephone, and bearer of messages, documents, and
what-not from one to the other for a nominal wage and the crumbs that
dropped from the promoter's table.The fog and the gloom thickened, and Ketchim sat deeply immersed in
both.He was still shaking from the fright which he had received that
morning.On opening the door as he was about to leave his house to
take the train to the city, he had confronted two bulky policemen.With a muffled shriek he had slammed the door in their astonished
faces and darted back into the house, his heart in his throat and
hammering madly.How could he know that they were only selling tickets
to a Policemen's Ball?Then he had crept to the window and, concealed
in the folds of the curtain, had watched them go down the street,
laughing and turning often to glance back at the house that held such
a queer-mannered inmate.Rousing himself from the gloomy revery into which he had lapsed,
Ketchim switched on the light and took up again the report of Reed
and Harris.Sullenly he turned its pages, while the sallow skin on his
low forehead wrinkled, and his bird-like face drew into ugly
contortions."Didn't they see that clause in their contract,
providing an additional fifty thousand in stock for them in case they
made a favorable report?"A light tap at the door, and a low cough, preceded the noiseless
entrance of the meek-souled Rawlins."A--a--this is the list which Reverend Jurges sent us--names and
addresses of his congregation.I've mailed them all descriptive
matter; and I wrote Mr.Jurges that the price of his stock would be
five dollars, but that we couldn't sell to his congregation for less
than seven.I told him Molino stock would go
up to par next month."How much stock did Jurges say he'd take?"demanded Ketchim, without
looking up."Why, he said he could only get together two thousand dollars at
present, but that later he would have some endowment insurance falling
due--"

"How soon?""About a year, I think he said.""Well, he ought to be able to borrow on that."Do so--but only hint at it.And tell him to send his check at once
for the stock he has agreed to take.""Why, he sent that some days ago.I thought you--"

"He did?"cried Ketchim, his interest now fully aroused."Er--your brother James received the letter, and I believe he put the
check in his pocket."Ketchim gave vent to a snort of rage."You tell James," he cried,
pounding the desk with his fist, "that as president and treasurer of
the Molino Company I demand that check!""Yes, sir--and--"

"Well?"Cass 'phoned before you got down this morning.He said the bank
refused to extend the time on your note."Ketchim sank back limply into his chair, and his face became ashen."And here is the mail," pursued the gentle Hermes, handing him a
bundle of letters.Ketchim roused himself with an effort."Do
you know whether James has been selling any of his own Molino stock?""I--I believe he has, sir--a little.""He sold some two hundred shares yesterday--I believe; to a Miss
Leveridge.""Why, the Leveridge children--grown men and women now--have just sold
their farm down state; and Mr.James saw the sale announced in the
papers.So he got in touch with Miss Alvina Leveridge.I believe he
sent Houghton down there; and he closed a deal.James got eight
dollars a share, I believe."Ketchim gulped down his wrath, and continued:

"How much did the Leveridges get for their farm?And why didn't you
inform me of the sale?"he demanded, fixing the humble Rawlins with a
cold eye."A--a--twenty-five thousand dollars, sir, I believe.And I didn't see
the notice until--"

"As usual, James saw it first!"James is still dickering with Miss Leveridge, I
suppose?""Nezlett got back last night, didn't he?Very well, call him up and
tell him to get ready to go at once to--wherever the Leveridges live.And--I want to see him right away!"He abruptly dismissed the factotum and turned to his mail.As his
glance fell upon the pile he gasped.Then he quickly drew out a letter
and tore it open.His thin lips moved rapidly as his eyes roved over
the paper.He laid the letter down and looked wildly about.Then he
took it up again and read aloud the closing words:

  "--and, having bought somewhat heavily of Molino stock, and
  believing that your representations were made with intent to
  deceive, I shall, unless immediate reparation or satisfactory
  explanation is made, take such steps as my counsel may advise.Mary moved to the bedroom."Yours, etc.,
                                                 "J. WILTON AMES."Congealing with fear, Ketchim took his stock memorandum from a drawer
and consulted it."He put in ten thousand, cash," he murmured, closing
the book and replacing it."And I always wondered why, for he doesn't
go into things that he can't control.He
shouldn't have been sold a dollar's worth!He knows we can't return
the money; and now he's tightening the screws!He has something up his
sleeve; and we've fallen for it!"He settled back in his chair and groaned aloud.Did
he think he'd reach Uncle Ted through us?For a
year or more he's wanted to oust Uncle from the C.& R., and now he
thinks by threatening the family with disgrace, and us fellows with
the pen, he can do it!Oh, if I ever get out of
this I'll steer clear of these deals in the future!"It was his stock
resolution, which had never borne fruit.The door opened slightly, and the noiseless Rawlins timidly announced
the arrival of Reed and Harris.cried Ketchim, jumping up and hastily passing
his hands over his hair and face.Then, advancing with a wan smile, he
courteously greeted the callers."Well, fellows," he began, waving them to seats, "it looks a
little bad for Molino, doesn't it?I've just been reading your
report--although of course you told me over the 'phone yesterday
that there was no hope.But," he continued gravely, and his face
grew serious, "I'm glad, very glad, of one thing, and that is that
there are men in the world to-day who are above temptation.""Why," continued Ketchim, smiling pallidly, "the little joker that
James inserted in the contract, about your getting fifty thousand in
the event of a favorable report.I told him it didn't look well--but
he said it would test you.He would be funny, though, no matter how
serious the business.Harris snickered; but Reed turned the conversation at once."We have
been studying how we could help you pull the thing out of the fire.Suppose you give us," he suggested, "a little of Molino's history."There isn't much to tell," replied Ketchim gloomily."The mines were
located by a man named Lakes, at one time acting-Consul at Cartagena.He came up to New York and interested
Bryan, Westler, and some others, and they asked us to act as fiscal
agents.""But you never had title to the property," said Reed."Because, on our way down the Magdalena river we made the acquaintance
of a certain Captain Pinal, of the Colombian army.When he learned
that we were mining men he told us he had a string of rich properties
that he would like to sell.I inquired their location, and he said
they lay along the Boque river.And I learned that he had clear title
to the property, too--Molino's mines.Now you have sold some three or
four hundred thousand dollars' worth of stock on alleged mines to
which you never had even the shadow of a claim!""But--" murmured Ketchim weakly, "we thought we had.We acted in good
faith--we took Mr.Lakes's word--and we showed our confidence and
sincerity by purchasing machinery to operate--"

"Oh, the machinery went down there, all right!""I judge it was designed to manufacture barrel staves, rather
than to extract gold!Lakes had it shipped to Cartagena; rented part
of an old woman's house; dumped the machinery in there; and now she's
wild.Can't get her pay from you for storing the machinery; and can't
sell the stuff, nor move it.So there she sits, under some six or
eight tons of iron junk, waiting for the Lord to perform a miracle!""But Molino has no
funds--"

"You are still selling stock, aren't you?""We would not sell any more stock
until we received your report--and not then, unless the report were
favorable.But the image of truth sat enthroned upon
Ketchim's sharp features."It is unfortunate, boys," the promoter continued dejectedly."But I
care nothing for my own losses; it's the poor stockholders I am
thinking about.I've prayed to be
led to do right."I suggest," blurted out Harris, "that, having already relieved them
considerably, you'll soon be wearing a striped suit!"The last trace of color faded from Ketchim's face, but the sickly
smile remained."I'd wear it, willingly, if by so doing I could help
these poor people," he mournfully replied."Well," pursued Harris, "it'll help some when they learn that you're
in one.""Boys," said Ketchim suddenly, quite disregarding the insinuation,
"to-morrow is Sunday, and I want you both out to dinner with me, and
we will talk this all over.Then in the afternoon I want you to come
over and see my little Sunday school.Fellows," he continued gravely,
"I've prayed for you and for your success every day since you left.And my faith in my Saviour is too great to be shattered now by your
adverse report.He certainly will show us a way out; and I can trust
him and wait."Reed and Harris looked at him and then at each other with puzzled
expressions on their faces.The man continued earnestly:

"Colombia is a rich and undeveloped country, you have said.There must
be other mineral properties available there.Did you see none on your
travels?Or could we not organize an exploration party to search for
mines?""Will your sheep stand for further shearing?""Fellows," said Ketchim, brightening and drawing his chair closer,
"you've got something--I know it!You've got something to suggest that
will save the Molino stockholders!""I shall sacrifice myself," answered Ketchim deprecatingly.His manner
had now become animated, and he leaned expectantly toward them.Reed and Harris again looked questioningly at each other."I guess we
might as well," said Reed in a low voice."It is bound to come out,
anyway.""Sure," returned Harris; "drive ahead."Ketchim," began Reed, turning to the eager, fidgeting man, "when
I came to New York a year ago, looking for a business opening, my
friend and former classmate in the University, Mr.Cass, put me in
touch with you.At that time you were booming the Molino company hard,
and, I have no doubt, thought you really had something down in
Colombia.But when you offered to lease me a portion of your
properties there, I laughed at you.And, in the course of time, I
succeeded in convincing you that you knew nothing whatsoever about the
properties on which you were selling so much stock.Then, after months
of parley, from an offer to permit me to go down to Colombia at my own
expense to examine Molino's mines, to ascertain whether or not I
wished to operate a part of them on a royalty basis, you adopted my
own view, namely, that the time had come for you to know whether the
company possessed anything of value or not.And so you sent my
associate, Mr.Harris, and myself down there to examine and report on
Molino's so-called mines.And you gave us each a block of stock as
part compensation.And now you have got to
face a body of stockholders from whom you have lured thousands of
dollars by your misrepresentations.From talks with your salesmen, I
am convinced that this body of stockholders is made up chiefly of
widows and indigent clergymen.""Which of my salesmen told you that?""Let us waive that," replied Reed calmly."The fact is, you are in a
hard way just at present, is it not so?""Fellows," said Ketchim, with an air of penitent humility, "the
officers and stockholders of the Molino Company have been grossly
deceived and unfortunately--"

"All right," interrupted Reed, "we'll pass that.But Harris and I have
played square with you.And we are going to continue to do so, and to
offer you a possible opportunity to do something for your poor
stockholders, and incidentally for yourself and us.The fact is, we do
know of another property down there, but we haven't the title--"

"That makes no difference!""I mean, it can be
acquired--" striving to restrain his eagerness."That's just the question," replied Reed."The title is at present
vested in a young Colombian girl, who, unfortunately, is lost.This
girl came up to the States with us--"

"Ha!"exclaimed Ketchim, unable longer to hold himself."Then you
broke your contract, for that stipulated that whatever you might
acquire there should belong to me!"I believe," put in Harris dryly, "we were employed by the Molino
company.""But my mother advanced the funds to send you down there!"queried Harris, with an insinuating
grin."I'm speaking for the stockholders, of course," said Ketchim,
subsiding."There is no likelihood that this poor girl will ever be heard of
again," continued Reed."Nor is it likely that the title papers, which
she has with her, will be of any use to those into whose hands she has
fallen.Her old foster-father held the title to this mine, but
transferred it to the girl, stipulating that she and I should divide a
large interest in the stock of a company formed to develop and operate
it.For my share, I agreed to bring the young girl to the States and
place her in a school, at my own expense."He went on to relate the
manner in which Carmen had been lost, and then continued: "Of course,
the title to this mine is registered in Cartagena, and in the girl's
name, as the old man gave me power to have that change made.But, now
that she is gone, the property naturally reverts to him.""No, that wouldn't be right to the old man," returned Reed."But, it
might be that the property could now be secured from him.He is old
and penniless, and without any further interest in life.It is a bare
chance, but we might prevail upon him to join us in the formation of a
company to take over his mine, La Libertad."asked Ketchim, reaching for a writing pad.Reed complied, and then continued: "Now, Mr.Ketchim, we are living
strictly up to the letter of our contract by giving you this
information.It would require not less than one hundred thousand
dollars, cash in hand, to acquire that mine, develop it, make trails,
and erect a stamp-mill.Harris and I are in no condition
financially to advance or secure such an amount.""It is barely possible," mused Harris, "that my father and Uncle John
could do something.""We don't have to call upon them!"Reed, in this mine already belongs to Molino, as you were acting under
contract with us--"

"I have covered that point, Mr."But
the time has come for us all to put our shoulders to the wheel, act
fairly with one another, help the Molino stockholders, and at the same
time make good ourselves.Harris and I have barely entered upon
our business careers, and we have come to New York to establish
ourselves.We know where this mine
is--we know the old man, and may be able to influence him.To
forestall possible complications, we should begin negotiations with
him at once.But--remember--everything must be done in the name of the
company, not in your own name.Harris and I must personally
negotiate with the old man, and receive a very liberal compensation
for our work."why didn't
you tell me this yesterday over the 'phone, and save me a night of
torment?Rawlins," he said, addressing
that individual, who had entered in response to the buzzer, "'phone
Cass to come right over.And tell Miss Honeywell to give you ten
dollars for our lunch, and charge it to Molino.Since the old man gave
you a share in the mine, Molino has property, after all!""Has it to get," amended Harris dubiously.cried Ketchim, rubbing his hands gleefully."But
now while waiting for Cass, tell me more about your trip.In the midst of the ensuing recital, Cass was announced; and Ketchim,
after detailing to him the previous conversation, launched into the
project which had been developing in his own mind while Reed had been
describing his experiences in the South."What we want is another organization, fellows," he said in
conclusion, "to take over the tottering Molino; purchase its assets
with stock; give Molino stockholders an opportunity to get in on the
ground floor, and so on.We'll let Molino die in the arms of a new
company, eh?""But one with a somewhat wider scope," suggested Cass, with an air of
importance."A sort of general development company, to secure La
Libertad, if possible; prospect for other mineral properties; and
develop the resources of the country.""Just so," assented Ketchim, with increasing enthusiasm."A company to
go in for coffee, cotton--you say you saw wild cotton, didn't you,
fellows?And cocoanuts, timber, cattle--in fact, we'll get
concessions from the Colombian Government, and we'll--"

"Just rip things wide open, eh?""Uncle Ted has influence at
Washington, with the Pan American Union, and so on--why, we can get
anything we want!Ames and the bank will both cool down--by Jove, this
is great!""But where's the cold and vulgar cash coming from to oil the wheels?""Oh, I can sell the stock," replied Ketchim."Then, too, there's the
Molino stockholders; why, I'll bet there's hardly one that wouldn't be
able to scrape up a few dollars more for the new company!By the way,
what'll we call it?"I'd call it the Salvation Company," drawled Harris, "as it is likely
to delay your trip to Sing Sing."A general laugh, in which Ketchim joined heartily, followed the
remark."I suggest we call it the Simiti Development Company," said Cass,
after a moment's dignified reflection."If these gentlemen can acquire that mine, I
think I would capitalize for, say, about three millions."He went to
the desk and made some calculations."I assume," he continued somewhat
pompously after a few moments' figuring, "that you wish to retain me,
and that I am to take my compensation in stock?"He knew that Cass had correctly concluded
that in no other way was he likely to be reimbursed.And, at best, it
was only a hazard, a wild gamble.In fact, it was a last desperate
chance.Moreover, stock was always available; while cash was a rare
commodity."Suppose, then," continued the sapient young lawyer, "that we
capitalize for three millions; set aside one million, five hundred and
one thousand as treasury stock, to be sold to raise money for
development purposes; transfer to the Ketchim Realty Company one
million, as compensation for acting as fiscal agents of the new
company; transfer to these two gentlemen, as part compensation for
past and future services, the sum of four hundred thousand in stock;
give to the stockholders of the Molino Company the sum of fifty-nine
thousand in stock for all the assets, machinery, good will, _et
cetera_, of that company; and to me, for services to be rendered,
forty thousand dollars' worth of the stock.All of us shall agree not
to sell any of our personal holdings of stock until the company shall
be placed upon a dividend-paying basis.Harris,
or both, will return to Colombia immediately to relocate the mine, and
prepare for its development, while the Ketchim Realty Company at once
endeavor to sell the treasury stock."Having delivered himself of this comprehensive plan, Cass settled back
in his chair and awaited remarks."Well," observed Ketchim at length, "that's all right--only, I think
we should be allowed to sell our personal stock if we wish.Of
course," with a deprecating wave of his hand, "there isn't the
slightest likelihood of our ever wanting to do that--with a mine such
as you have described, fellows."Not one dollar's worth of your stock shall you be permitted to sell!"cried Harris, bringing his fist down upon the desk."I suggest that we leave that for the Directors to decide later,"
offered Cass, anxious to avoid discord.He was young, scarcely out of
the twenties, just married, just admitted to the bar, and eager to get
a toe-hold in the world of business."And now," he concluded, "if
agreeable to you, I will put this through at once, organize the
company, and get the charter.You gentlemen will return to Colombia as
soon as Mr.Harris and I have formed an engineering partnership," said Reed."As such, we will handle the affairs of the new company in Colombia.Harris will proceed to that country, while I go to California to
open a copper mine which we have taken over there."I'll send Houghton and Nezlett out on the road to-morrow.Rawlins
has just told me of one prospect, a bully one!We don't need to
wait for the papers from Albany before going ahead.But we find it
costs about forty-eight cents to sell a dollar's worth of stock, and
so some time will be needed to raise enough to send Mr.Harris back
to Colombia--unless," he added, eying Harris furtively, "he will
advance us the amount of his own expenses--"

"Which he will not!""There's a revolution on down there now," said Reed, "and we'd better
go easy for a while.Besides, Harris needs time to study the language.But, are we all agreed on the terms?Salary for Harris while in
Colombia to be settled later, of course.""It's all satisfactory, I think," said Ketchim, smiling happily."The
details can be worked out anon--Molino stockholders' meeting, and so
on.""Then," said Reed, rising, "we will consider the new company launched,
to take over the defunct Molino and to operate on a comprehensive
scale in Colombia, beginning with the development of La Libertad, if
we can secure it."At that moment Rawlins opened the door and peered in.Reed," he announced softly; "a priest, I believe."The door swung open, and Father Waite
entered with Carmen.With a glad cry the girl dropped her bundle and bounded into the arms
of the astonished Harris.Reed grasped the priest's hand, and begged
him to speak.Ketchim and the young lawyer looked on in perplexity."I was unable to find your name in the city directory, Mr.Reed,"
explained the priest, his face beaming with happiness."But at police
headquarters I found that you had made inquiries, and that detectives
were searching for the girl.I learned that you were living with your
wife's sister, and that you had no business address, having just come
up from South America.So I telephoned to your sister-in-law, and your
wife informed me that you had an appointment this morning at this
office.I therefore came directly here with the girl, who, as you see,
is safe and sound, but with an additional interesting experience or
two to add to the large fund she already possessed."He looked down at
Carmen and smiled."And now," he concluded, laughing, as he prepared
to depart, "I will not ask for a receipt for the child, as I see I
have several witnesses to the fact that I have delivered her to the
proper custodian."cried Reed, seizing him by the hand.We
want to know you--"

"I will give you my card," replied the priest."And I would be very
happy, indeed, if some time again I might be permitted to see and talk
with the little girl."He handed his card to Reed; then nodded and
smiled at Carmen and went out.sputtered Harris, pushing the girl aside and making after
him.The priest had already caught a descending
elevator, and disappeared."I
guess that knocks the Simiti Company sky-high," he exclaimed, "for
here is the sole owner of La Libertad!"Ketchim collapsed into a chair, while Reed, saying that he would keep
his dinner engagement with Ketchim on the following day, picked up
Carmen's precious bundle and, taking her hand, left the room."I am
going home," he called back to Harris; "and you be sure to come up to
the house to-night.We'll have to readjust our plans now."CHAPTER 5


"Reed," said Harris the following day, as they sat in the dusty,
creaking car that was conveying them to their dinner appointment with
Ketchim, "who is this Ames that Ketchim referred to yesterday?"The men were not alone, for Carmen accompanied them.Reed was
reluctantly bringing her at the urgent request received from Ketchim
over the telephone the previous evening.But the girl, subdued by the
rush of events since her precipitation into the seething American
world of materialism, sat apart from them, gazing with rapt attention
through the begrimed window at the flying scenery, and trying to
interpret it in the light of her own tenacious views of life and the
universe.If the marvels of this new world into which she had been
thrown had failed to realize her expectations--if she saw in them, and
in the sense of life which they express, something less real, less
substantial, than do those who laud its grandeur and power to
charm--she gave no hint.She was still absorbing, sifting and
digesting the welter of impressions.She had been overpowered,
smothered by the innovation; and she now found her thoughts a tangled
jumble, which she strove incessantly to unravel and classify according
to their content of reality, as judged by her own standards."Why, Ames," replied Reed, turning a watchful eye upon Carmen, "is a
multimillionaire financier of New York--surely you have heard of him!He and his clique practically own the United States, and a large
slice of Europe.For some reason Ames bought a block of Molino stock.And now, I judge, Ketchim would give his chances on eternal life if he
hadn't sold it to him.And that's what's worrying me, too.For, since
Ames is heavily interested in Molino, what will he do to the new
company that absorbs it?""There isn't going to be any new company," asserted Harris doggedly."Ketchim holds us strictly to our
contract.Our negotiations with old Rosendo were made while in the
employ of Molino.It wouldn't be so bad if we had only Ketchim to deal
with.We've got the goods on him and could beat him.But here enters
Ames, a man of unlimited wealth and influence.If he wants La
Libertad, he's going to get it, you mark me!Where we fell down was in
ever mentioning it to Ketchim.For if we don't come over now he will
lay the whole affair before Ames.He told me over the 'phone last
night that he was badly in debt--that Ames was pressing him--that many
of the Molino stockholders were making pertinent inquiries.And yesterday I saw on his desk a letter from
Ames.Ketchim would sacrifice us and
everything else to keep himself out of Ames's grip.We're in for it, I
tell you!And all because we were a bit too previous in believing that
the girl had disappeared for good."exclaimed Harris, "but doesn't it sound like a fairy-tale,
the way Carmen got back to us?""And here I am," continued Reed, with a gesture of vexation, "left
with the girl on my hands, and with a very healthy prospect of losing
out all around.My wife said emphatically last night that she wouldn't
be bothered with Carmen.""But do you realize
that that involves expense?I'm a comparatively poor man, just getting
a start in my profession, and with a young and socially ambitious
wife!""But--your wife--er, she's going to--to have money some day, isn't
she?"But the grim reaper has a little work to do first.And on
occasions like this he's always deucedly deliberate, you know.Meantime, we're skating close to the edge--for New Yorkers.""Well, we may be able to beat Ketchim.Now, my father and Uncle
John--"

"Oh, shoot your father and Uncle John!"The conductor opened the door and bawled a cryptical announcement."This is the place," said Reed, starting up and making for the door."And now you rake your thought for some way to deal with Ketchim.And
leave your father and Uncle John entirely out of the conversation!"Ketchim was just bowing out a caller as the young engineers mounted
the steps.he exclaimed, after giving them a hearty
welcome."I just sold him a hundred shares of Simiti stock, at five
dollars a share--just half of par."But--" protested Harris, as they entered the spacious parlor, "the
company isn't even in existence yet--and hasn't an asset!""Oh, that's all right," replied Ketchim easily."It's coming into
existence, and will have the grandest mine in South America!Boys," he
went on earnestly, "I've been talking over the 'phone with Mr.Ames,
our most influential stockholder, and a very warm friend of mine.I
told him about our conversation of yesterday.He says, go right ahead
with the new company--that it's a great idea.He's satisfied with his
present holding, and will not increase it.Says he wants Molino
stockholders to have the opportunity to purchase all the treasury
stock, if they want to.""Decidedly magnanimous," returned Reed."But--what about the basis of
organization of the new company?""Leave it as we planned it, he says.He thinks the arrangement and
division of stock fine!"Reed and Harris looked at each other questioningly."But," went on Ketchim, "have you seen the morning papers?They are
full of the revolution in Colombia.The country is torn wide open,
and reports say nothing can be done down there until peace is
restored--and that may take a year or two.But, meantime, we will go
ahead and organize the new company and take over Molino and prepare
to begin work just as soon as you fellows can get into that country.And so this," going to
Carmen and taking her hand, "is the wonderful little girl!Ketchim and her troop of children at this
juncture interrupted the conversation."All enthusiastic Simiti
stockholders," said Ketchim, waving his hand toward them, after the
introductions."And all going to get rich out of it, too--as well as
yourselves, boys.It simply shows how Providence works--one with God
is a majority, always."Carmen glanced up at him wonderingly.Dinner over, the men were left alone.Carmen had been taken upstairs
by the children to the nursery."I've got myself slated for the presidency of the new company," said
Ketchim, plunging again into the subject nearest his heart; "and I
think we'd better put brother James in as vice-president.Perfectly
safe," looking at Harris and winking."He's got to be recognized, you
know, since the Ketchim Realty Company act as fiscal agents.Now for
directors I've put down Judge Harris, your father--that's to assure
you boys that there'll be some one to look after your interests.Then
we'll say Reverend Jurges for another.He's got a big congregation and
will be able to place a lot of stock.You just ought to see the letter
he wrote me about selling stock to his people!You'd never believe he
was a good, spiritually-minded clergyman, with an eye single to
heavenly riches!Then one of you fellows, say Reed, had better go on
the directorate, since Harris will be in Colombia in charge of
operations.He's young and immature, but
absolutely square.He'll do all the legal work for his stock interest."But what do I do while we are waiting?"asked Harris in some
perplexity."Reed goes to California right away, you know.""That's all right, old man," Ketchim genially assured him."The new
company will be organized at once--this week, if possible.You go on
salary from the moment of its incorporation, and you open your office
right here in this building.I'll see that the rent is paid until you
go back to Colombia.Everything's arranged, and you turn right in and
help Cass with the new company.You've got
to prepare circulars; write boosting letters to stockholders and
prospects; follow up leads; and--oh, you'll be busy!But here comes
Reverend Coles," looking out of the window as a man came up the steps."He's interested in some projects I've been exploiting.He hastened out to greet the visitor and conducted him into a back
room.Reed and Harris were left to the contemplation of their own
mixed thoughts.Presently Harris, whose eyes had been dilating
for some moments, broke out in a hoarse whisper: "Listen!God
a'mighty!--he's praying!"He got up softly and approached the door of the room into which
Ketchim had taken his caller.In a few minutes he returned to his
chair."I could see Ketchim through the
keyhole, on his knees by the bed, praying with that fellow!Through the silence that fell upon
them snatches of the prayer being offered in the adjoining room
floated to their ears--"O, blessed Saviour, vouchsafe prosperity to
our venture, we beseech thee!The earth is the Lord's, and the
fullness thereof--we ask thy blessing on these efforts of ours to
wrest from the ground the wealth which the Father of lights has
deposited there for the benefit of His children--"

Harris snickered aloud."It may not be a game," he replied."But if it is, it's an old one, hiding behind the mask of religion.But I'm inclined to believe the man sincere."I
know James to be an out-and-out rascal--he openly flies the black
flag.But this pious fellow--well, he's got me guessing!"The caller soon departed, and Ketchim again joined the young men."He's our assistant pastor," he said musingly, as he watched the man
go down the walk."Nice young fellow, waiting for a church.He and
some of his friends are interested in a zinc mine we've been floating,
down in the Joplin district."queried the cynical Harris, with a twinkle in his eyes."Oh, yes," Ketchim smiled affably.Lots of development work to be done, you know.And there's a lot of water in this mine.""And in the stock, too, eh?""We haven't struck the deposit yet, although we expect to soon.But,"
glancing up at the clock on the mantel, "we'll have to be going over
to Sunday school now.And I want that little girl to go with Marjorie.Fellows," the man's face became deeply serious, "I have no doubt you
are both church members?"Reed fidgeted uneasily under Ketchim's searching glance; but Harris
frankly met the question."Nope," he asserted, "we're both rank
heathen.And I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist."cried Ketchim, "how can you say that, when you see the
goodness of the Lord on every hand?""Reed, I believe," continued the imperturbable Harris, waving a hand
toward his friend, "has philosophical leanings--New Thought,
Subliminal Consciousness, Power in Silence, and all that."But surely you believe in the divinity of the Christ?""Well, as a matter of fact, I never gave it much thought," said
Harris."Ah, that's what so many say," replied Ketchim sadly; "and then comes
the awful voice of the Lord, 'This night thy soul shall be required of
thee!'Fellows, I want to pray for you; and I want you both to promise
me that you will take up seriously the consideration of your souls'
welfare.It's too grave a subject for jest," addressing himself
solemnly to the grinning Harris."All right, old man," laughed Harris."But don't dig up any
Presbyterian tracts for me.I've got a living witness to--well, to
something out of the ordinary, in that girl, Carmen, and I'm inclined
to believe she's dug nearer to bottom facts than any of you.So when
I'm ready to discuss my soul's welfare I'll just consult her, see?""That reminds me," said Ketchim, turning abruptly to Reed, "what do
you intend to do with the girl?""_Quien sabe?_" Reed answered abstractedly."Send her to a boarding
school, I guess.At least, that's what I told the old man I'd do.""So you said before," Ketchim returned.My daughter Marjorie leaves Tuesday
for Conway-on-the-Hudson, where she has been attending Madam Elwin's
Select School for Girls.Suppose you go with her--I'm too busy,
myself--and take Carmen.It's only a few hours' ride by boat down the
river.This is Marjorie's third year
there, and she's simply in love with it."Reed began to show signs of interest; and Ketchim, noting the effect
of his words, went on briskly:

"Now look here, Molino owes its salvation, and the new company its
existence, to that girl.Why shouldn't they do something to show their
gratitude?I say, it is no more than right that the new company should
support her while she is in school."not a half-bad idea," commented Harris."Certainly not," continued Ketchim earnestly."Now fix up everything
with her as regards the transfer of the mine to the new company, and
then let her go with Marjorie to the Elwin school.We can, if you
like, make some agreement with her to the effect that when the company
is on its feet and she is receiving dividends, she shall return what
it may advance for her schooling, eh?""You'd better accept the suggestion, Reed," put in Harris."I'll be
here, you know, to keep an eye on the girl; and I'll take her and
Marjorie down to Conway myself, and attend to getting her located
right."He was hardly in a position to refuse such
an offer.Besides, he was really leaving her in charge of Harris."Well," he said at length, "in that case I could leave for California
to-morrow night.That matter is pressing hard--all right, I accept the
company's offer.It's no more than is due the girl, anyway.""I'll make the necessary arrangements at
once.Thus it was that two days later Carmen, still wondering if she was
dreaming, was enrolled in the Elwin Select School for Girls, with
Marjorie Ketchim for roommate; while Reed, on the Overland Limited,
hurrying to the far West, was musing dubiously at frequent intervals
on Ketchim's rather conflicting statements, which, until left to this
enforced leisure, he had not had time to try to reconcile.At the same
time, while Harris was loudly declaiming to the gracious Madam Elwin
on the astonishing mental prowess of the girl, Ketchim and Cass sat
deeply immersed in the tentative plans for the newly-projected Simiti
Development Company."Now listen," said Ketchim, who for some minutes had been quietly
scanning his youthful lawyer, "Ames knows nothing about the formation
of this company, but Harris and Reed are not to know that; and we're
going to keep Ames in ignorance of all our plans.With the first sales
of stock--and they've already begun--we'll return him his Molino
investment.Nezlett wired me this morning that he's sure to sell a big
block to the Leveridges, that they're mightily interested, and want to
meet Carmen.We'll use the girl for just such purposes.That's one
reason why I wanted her handy, so's we could reach her at any time.She makes a star impression; and with her as an advertisement we'll
sell a million dollars' worth of stock, and no trouble at all!She's
got that honest look that's convincing.And she can tell a story that
beats the Arabian Nights!Ames has given me a week to explain, or make
good his investment.By that time we'll have the Leveridges sold for
twice his investment, and we'll just pay him off and remove him.Meantime, you go over to the bank in the morning and put up the best
line of talk you're capable of.I've got sixteen hundred dollars to
give 'em on that note; and that'll secure more time, until the sales
of stock are enough to pay it all up.Perhaps Uncle Ted will advance
me enough to take up the note when he hears about La Libertad.And,
say, you see brother James, and shake the club over him until he
disgorges that check he got from Miss Leveridge.You can hand him a
scare that he won't get over.things have taken a
great turn, eh?Why, I can just see Simiti stock sales humping these
next few months.Oh, Miss Honeywell," calling to his cashier, "bring
me five dollars, please, and charge it to Molino--I mean, to Simiti.Then, again addressing Cass: "Come
with me to the football game this afternoon.We can discuss plans
there as well as here.Gee whiz, but I feel great!"CHAPTER 6


Carmen's rapid transition from the eternal solitudes of Guamoco to the
whirring activities of New York was like a plunge into the maelstrom,
and left her groping blindly in the effort to adapt herself to the
changed order.There was little in her former mode of existence that
could be transferred to her new environment, and she felt that she was
starting life like a new-born babe.For days, even weeks, she moved
about dreamily, absorbed, ceaselessly striving to orient herself and
to accept easily and naturally the marvels, the sudden accession of
material aids, and the wonders of this modern, complex civilization,
so common to her associates, but scarcely even dreamed of by her in
her former home, despite the preparation which Jose had tried to give
her.The Elwin school was small, its student-body seldom numbering
more than fifty, and in it Carmen found herself hedged about by
restrictions which in a way were beneficial, in that they narrowed her
environment and afforded her time for her slow adjustment to it.But if these restrictions aided her, they also rendered the length of
her stay in the school almost calculable.Little by little the girl
saw the forces developing which she knew must effect her dismissal;
little by little, as Madam Elwin's manner toward her became less
gracious, and her schoolmates made fewer efforts to conceal from her
the fact that she was not one of them, Carmen prepared for the
inevitable.Six months after the girl's enrollment, Madam Elwin
terminated her series of disparaging reports to Ketchim by a request
that he come at once and remove his charge from the school.Ketchim, the girl is a paradox.And
after these months of disappointing effort to instruct her, I am
forced to throw up my hands in despair and send for you."Madam Elwin
tapped nervously with a dainty finger upon the desk before her."But, if I may be permitted the question, what specific reasons have
you, Madam, for--ah, for requesting her removal?"William Jurges, who, having come up to the city to
attend a meeting of the directors of the Simiti company, had accepted
Ketchim's invitation to first accompany him on his flying trip to
Conway-on-the-Hudson, in response to Madam Elwin's peremptory
summons."Because," replied that worthy personage with a show of exasperation, "I
consider her influence upon the young ladies here quite detrimental.Our school, while non-sectarian, is at least Christian.Where she got her views, I can not imagine.At first she made
frequent mention of a Catholic priest, who taught her in her home town,
in South America.But of late she has grown very reserved--I might say,
sullen, and talks but little.Her views, however, are certainly not
Catholic.She refuses to
accept a large part of our instruction.Her answers to examination
questions are wholly in accord with her peculiar views, and hence quite
apart from the texts.For that reason she fails to make any grades,
excepting in mathematics and the languages.She utterly refuses to
accept any religious instruction whatsoever.She would not be called
atheistic, for she talks--or used to at first--continually about God.But her God is not the God of the Scriptures, Dr.She is a
free-thinker, in the strictest sense.And as such, we can not
consent to her remaining longer with us.""Ah--quite so, Madam, quite so," returned the clergyman, in his
unconsciously pompous manner."Doubtless the child's thought
became--ah--contaminated ere she was placed in your care.But--ah--I
have heard so much from our good friend, Mr.Ketchim, regarding this
young girl, that--ah--I should like exceedingly to see and talk with
her--if it might be--ah--"

"Madam Elwin will arrange that, I am sure," interposed Ketchim."Suppose," he suggested, addressing the lady, "we let him talk with
her, while I discuss with you our recently acquired mine in South
America, and the advisability of an investment with us.""Certainly," acquiesced Madam Elwin, rising and pressing one of the
several buttons in the desk."Bring Miss Carmen," she directed, to the
maid who answered the summons.Jurges; "but may I go to her?Ah--it
would doubtless be less embarrassing for the child.""Miss Carmen was in the chapel a few moments ago," volunteered the
maid."Then take the doctor there," returned Madam Elwin, with a gesture of
dismissal.At the head of the stairway the mingled sounds of a human voice and
the soft, trembling notes of an organ drifted through the long hall
and fell upon the ears of the clergyman."Miss Carmen," said the maid, answering his unspoken thought."She
often comes up to the chapel and sings for hours at a time--alone.The
chapel is down there," pointing to the end of the hall."Then--ah--leave me," said the doctor.The maid turned willingly and went below, while the man tiptoed to
the chapel door.The girl was
singing in Spanish, and he could not understand the words.But they
would have meant nothing to him then.It was the voice upon which
they were borne that held him.The song was a weird lament that had
come down to the children of Simiti from the hard days of the
_Conquistadores_.It voiced the untold wrongs of the Indian slaves;
its sad, unvarying minor echoed their smothered moans under the
cruel goad; on the plaintive melody of the repeated chorus their
piteous cries were carried to heaven's deaf ears; their dull despair
floated up on the wailing tones of the little organ, and then died
away, as died the hope of the innocent victims of Spanish lust.The reverend doctor had never heard a song of that kind before.Nor
could he readily associate the voice, which again and again he could
not distinguish from the flute-like tones of the organ, with the
sordidness and grime of material, fleshly existence.He entered softly
and took a seat in the shadow of a pillar.The clear, sweet voice of
the young girl flowed over him like celestial balm.Some were dreamy bits and snatches in Spanish and English;
others were sacred in character.He wondered deeply, as the girl mused
over these; yet he knew not that they were her own compositions.Curiosity and uncertainty mastered him at length, and he got softly to
his feet and moved away from the pillar, that he might see from what
manner of being issued such unbroken harmony.But in his eagerness his
foot struck a chair, and the sound echoed loudly through the room.The music abruptly ceased, and the girl rose and looked over the organ
at the intruder."I--I beg your pardon," said the clergyman, advancing in some
embarrassment."I was listening to your singing--uninvited, but none
the less appreciative.I--"

"Wait, please!"cried the girl, hastily stooping over and fumbling
with her shoes.The doctor laughed genially, as he grasped the
situation."I took them off," she explained hurriedly."I am not yet accustomed
to them.I never wore shoes until I left Simiti."Her face was
scarlet, and she tried to cover her confusion with a little laugh.The doctor stood staring at her, lost in admiration of the shapely
figure, the heavy, curling hair, and the wonderfully expressive face.The girl quickly recovered her poise and returned him a frank smile.she said, after waiting in vain for him to
begin."Ah--a--yes, certainly--that is, I beg your pardon," stammered the
doctor."I did request permission of Madam Elwin to make your
acquaintance.I am Doctor Jurges, an
Episcopal clergyman."His sentences issued like blasts from an engine
exhaust."I am Carmen Ariza," said the girl, extending her hand."Ah--quite so, quite so," blustered the doctor, clearing his throat
noisily.Ah--ah--you have a remarkable voice.And my poor organ-playing is what I have
picked up myself these six months."The girl looked up into his face searchingly."Why," she asked,
"should every one up here think it remarkable when a human mind is
clear enough to be a transparency for God?"Had the roof fallen, the excellent doctor could have been no more
startled.He cleared his throat violently again; then fumbled
nervously in his pocket and drew out his glasses.These he poised upon
the ample arch of his ecclesiastical nose, and through them turned a
penetrating glance upon the girl.yes," said he at length; "quite so, quite so!And--ah--Miss
Carmen, that brings us to the matter in question--your religious
instruction--ah--may I ask from whom you received it?""From God," was the immediate and frank reply.The clergyman started, but quickly recovered his equipoise.But--your religious views--I believe they are not
considered--ah--quite evangelical, are they?By your present
associates, that is.""No," she replied, with a trace of sadness in her tone."But," looking
up with a queer little smile, "I am not persecuting them for that.""Oh, no," with a jerky little laugh.I judge the
persecution has come from the other side, has it not?""We will not speak of that," she said quickly."They do not
understand--that is all."no, quite so--that is--ah--may I ask why you think they do not
understand?"If that which I believe is not true," the girl replied evenly, "it
will fail under the test of demonstration.Their beliefs have long
since failed under such test--and yet they still cling jealously to
them, and try to force them upon all who disagree with them.I am a
heretic, Doctor.""H'm--ah--yes, I see.But--it is a quite unfortunate characteristic
of mankind to attribute one's views indiscriminately to the
Almighty--and--ah--I regret to note that you are not wholly free from
this error.""You do not understand, I think," she quickly returned."I put every
view, every thought, every idea to the test.If good is the result, I
know that the thought or idea comes from the source of all good, God.The views I hold are those which I have time and again tested--and
some of them have withstood trials which I think you would regard as
unusually severe."Her thought had rested momentarily upon her vivid
experience in Banco, the dangers which had menaced her in distant
Simiti, and the fire through which she had passed in her first hours
in Christian America, the land of churches, sects, and creeds.the worthy doctor mused, regarding the girl first through his
spectacles, and then over the tops of them, while his bushy eyebrows
moved up and down with such comicality that Carmen could scarcely
refrain from laughing.Ah--suppose you relate to me
some of the tests to which your views have been subjected.""No," she returned firmly; "those experiences were only states of
consciousness, which are now past and gone forever.Why go back now and give them the
appearance of reality?"H'm--then you do not regard untoward experience as given us
by God for the testing of our faith, I take it."Carmen turned her head away with a little sigh of weariness."I
think," she said slowly, "I think we had better not talk about these
things, Doctor."Why--ah," blustered the clergyman, assuming a more paternal air,
"we--ah--would not for a moment cause you embarrassment, Miss Carmen!But--in fact, Madam Elwin has--ah--expressed her disapproval of your
views--your religious ideals, if I may put it so baldly, and she--that
is--the good lady regrets--"

"She wishes to be rid of me, you mean, Doctor?"said the girl,
turning and stretching a mental hand to the sinking divine.well, hardly so--ah--so--"

"Doctor," said the girl calmly, "I know it, and I wish to go.I have
been waiting only to see the way open.I do not wish to remain longer
in an atmosphere where ignorance and false belief stifle all real
progress."The doctor turned another look of astonishment upon her.He had
forgotten that he had not been talking with one of his own age.But if her clear mental gaze
penetrated the ecclesiastical mask and surmounted the theological
assumptions of her interlocutor, enabling her to get close to the
heart of the man, she did not indicate it further."I am nearly
sixteen," was her only reply."Ah," he reflected, "just a child!My dear girl," he continued, laying
a hand indulgently upon hers, "I will advise with Madam Elwin, and
will endeavor to convince her that--ah--that your spiritual welfare,
if I may so put it, requires that you be not turned adrift at this
critical, transitorial period of your life.We must all be patient,
while we strive to counteract the--ah--the pernicious teaching to
which you were exposed before--ah--before becoming enrolled in this
excellent school."Carmen looked at him steadily for a moment before replying.There was
something of pity in the expression of her beautiful face, of tender
sympathy for those who seek the light, and who must some day find it,
but whose progress is as yet hampered by the human mind's unreasoning
adherence to the stepping-stones over which it has been passing
through the dark waters of ignorance."Then, Doctor," she said calmly,
"you know what I have been taught?""Why--ah--yes--that is, vaguely.He was beginning to be sensible of having passed judgment upon the
girl without first according her a hearing."Well," she smiled up at him, "I have been taught the very hardest
thing in the whole world."He again clutched at his mental poise.But--ah--is it not the function of all our schools to teach
us to think?""No," answered the girl decidedly; "not to teach us to think, but to
cause us blindly to accept what is ignorantly called 'authority'!I
find we are not to reason, and particularly about religious matters,
but to accept, to let those 'in authority' think for us.Are you not even now seeking to make me accept your religious views?Oh, no; but because you believe them
true--whether they are or not.Do your religious views rest upon anything
but the human mind's undemonstrated interpretation of the Bible?And
yet you can not prove that interpretation true, even though you would
force it upon such as I, who may differ from you.""I--ah--" began the doctor nervously.But Carmen continued without
heeding the interruption:

"Only yesterday Professor Bales, of the University, lectured here on
'The Prime Function of Education.'He said it was the development of
the individual, and that the chief end of educational work was the
promotion of originality.And yet, when I think along original
lines--when I depart from stereotyped formulae, and state boldly that I
will not accept any religion, be it Presbyterian, Methodist, or Roman
Catholic, that makes a God of spirit the creator of a man of flesh, or
that makes evil as real as good, and therefore necessarily created and
recognized by a God who by very necessity can not know evil--then I am
accused of being a heretic, a free-thinker; and the authorities take
steps to remove me, lest my influence contaminate the rest of the
pupils!""H'm--ah--yes, quite so--that is--I think--"

"Do you, a preacher, think?""Or do you
only _think_ that you think?Do you still believe with the world that
the passing of a stream of human thought, or a series of mental
pictures, through your mentality constitutes _real_ thinking?Do you
believe that jumping from one human mental concept to another
twenty-four hours a day constitutes thinking?Have you yet learned to
distinguish between God's thoughts and their opposites, human
thoughts?Have you a real, working,
demonstrable knowledge of Christianity?Do you heal the sick, raise
the dead, and preach the truth that sets men free from the mesmerism
of evil?If so, then you are unevangelical, too, and you and I are
both heretics, and we'd better--we'd better leave this building at
once, for I find that the Inquisition is still alive, even in
America!"Her face was flushed, and her
whole body quivered with emotion.Why, my dear young lady, this is a Christian
nation!""Then," said the girl, "you have still much to learn from the pagan
nations that have gone before."exclaimed the doctor, again adjusting his glasses
that he might see her more clearly."My dear child, you have been
thinking too much, and too seriously.""No, Doctor," she replied; "but you preachers have not been thinking
enough, nor even half seriously.Oh," she went on, while her eyes grew
moist, and ever and again her throat filled, "I had expected so much
in this great country!And I have found so little--so little that is
not wholly material, mechanical, and unreal!I had imagined that, with
all your learning and progress, which Padre Jose told me about, you
would know God much better than we in the darkened South.But your god
is matter, machinery, business, gold, and the unreal things that can
be bought with money.Some one wrote, in a recent newspaper, that
America's god was'mud and mammon!'What do I find the girls here in
this school talking about but dress, and society, and the unreal,
passing pleasures of the physical senses!There are religious services here every
Sunday, and sermons by preachers who come down from the city.Sometimes a Baptist; sometimes a Presbyterian; and sometimes an
Episcopalian, or a Methodist.Each has a different concept of God; yet they all believe
Him the creator of a man of flesh and bones, a man who was originally
made perfect, but who fell, and was then cursed by the good and
perfect God who made him.Oh, what childish views for men to hold and
preach!How could a good God create anything that could fall?And if
He could, and did, then He knew in advance that the man would fall,
and so God becomes responsible, not man.Oh, Doctor, is it possible
that you believe such stuff?Is it any
wonder that, holding such awful views, you preachers have no longer
the power to heal the sick?Do you not know that, in order to heal the
sick, one must become spiritually-minded?But no one who holds to the
puerile material beliefs embraced in your orthodox theology can
possibly be spiritual enough to do the works Jesus said we should all
do if we followed him--really understood him.""My dear child--you really are quite inconsistent--you--"

"Inconsistent!What a charge for an orthodox preacher to bring!Let us
see: You say that the Scriptures teach that God made man in His image
and likeness--the image and likeness of spirit.Spirit,
God, is eternal, immortal.Then while He exists can His image fade
away, or die?Can or would God cause it to do so?Can or would He
destroy His own reflection?And could that image, always being like
Him, ever change, or manifest sin, or disease, or evil, unless God
first manifested these things?And if God did manifest them, then,
perforce, the image would _have_ to do likewise.But, in that case,
could God justly punish His image for faithfully reflecting its
original?Oh, it is you preachers, lacking sufficient
spirituality to correctly interpret the Scriptures, who are wildly,
childishly, ignorantly inconsistent!"Carmen rose and faced the clergyman."I did not mean to condemn
you, Doctor," she said earnestly."I wage no warfare with persons
or things.My opposition is directed only against the entrenched human
thought that makes men spiritually blind and holds them in the
mesmeric chains of evil.I am young, as you reckon years, but I
have had much experience in the realm of thought--and it is there
that all experience is wrought out before it becomes externalized.I have told you, my teacher was God.He used as a channel a priest,
who came years ago to my little home town of Simiti, in far-off
Colombia.His life had been wrecked by holding to the belief of
evil as a power, real and intelligent.He began to see the light; but
he did not overcome fear sufficiently to make his demonstration and
break the imaginary bonds which held him.He saw, but he did not
prove.And, Doctor, you and everybody else will
have to do the same.For, unless Jesus uttered the most malicious
falsehoods ever voiced, every human being will have to take every
step that he took, make every demonstration that he made, and prove
all that he proved, before mortals will cease to consume with
disease, perish miserably in accidents, and sink with broken lives
into graves that do _not_ afford a gateway to immortal life!My God is
infinite, eternal, unchanging mind.The god of the preachers,
judging from their sermons preached here, is a human, mental
concept, embodying spirit and matter, knowing good and evil, and
changing with every caprice of their own unstable mentalities.My
religion is the Christianity of the Master, love.Oh, how this poor
world needs it, yearns for it!The love that demonstrates the
nothingness of evil, and drives it out of human experience!The love
that heals the sick, raises the dead, binds up broken hearts!The
love that will not quench the religious instincts of children, and
falsely educate them to know all manner of evil; but that teaches
them to recognize it for what it is, the lie about God, and then
shows them how to overcome it, even as Jesus did.Then all is spirit and
spirit's manifestation--is it not true?What, then, becomes of the
evil that men hug to their bosoms, even while it gnaws into their
hearts?It is the opposite of good, of mind, of truth, God.And
the opposite of truth is supposition.And you can put it out
whenever you are willing to drop your ceremonials and your theories,
and will open your mentality to truth, which will make you free,
even as the Master said.Those are
the religious views which you have been sent by Madam Elwin to
investigate.She waited a few moments for the doctor to reply.Then, as he remained
silent, she went up to him and held out her hand."You do not care to talk with me longer, I think," she said.But, as regards Madam Elwin's wishes, you may tell
her that I shall leave the school.""Have you--have you been fitting yourself for any--ah--particular
work--ah--for your support, that is?"inquired the doctor gravely, as
he took the proffered hand.He had been swept off his feet by the
girl's conversation, and he had not the temerity to combat her views."I have been working daily to gain a better
understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and through them, of God.My
single aim has been to acquire 'that mind which was in Christ Jesus.'And I have no other business than to reflect it to my fellow-men in a
life of service.That is my Father's business, and I am working with
Him.My mission in this world is to manifest God.I am going out now
to do that, and _to show what love will do_.God will use me, and He
will supply my every need.She turned abruptly from him and went to the organ.Soon the same song
which he had heard as he entered the room rose again through the
stillness.He started toward
the girl; checked himself; and stood hesitating.Then his lips set,
and he turned and walked slowly from the room.In the hall two women were approaching, and as they drew near he
recognized one of them."Why," he exclaimed with enthusiasm, holding out both hands, "my dear
Mrs.It is not so long since we met at the Weston's.But what, may I ask, brings you here?"We have come to,
make a duty call on Mr.Reed's protegee, the little South American
savage, you know.Madam Elwin said she was up here with you?""Ah, yes, quite so--er, in the chapel, I believe," said the clergyman,
his face becoming suddenly grave."I would return with you, but my
time is--ah--so limited."He bowed low, with his hand in the breast of
his long frock coat, and passed on down the hall.As the women approached the door of the chapel through which came
Carmen's low singing they turned and looked at each other inquiringly.Then they quietly entered the doorway and stood listening.Carmen,
concealed behind the organ, did not see them.Hawley-Crowles went quickly to the organ.Bending over it, she gazed down into the face of the startled girl."Get up and let me see what sort of a
looking creature you are."Reed came forward and gave her a tempered
greeting.Hawley-Crowles fell back and stared at the girl
from head to foot."You know," she said to her sister, "this is the
first glimpse I've had of your husband's discovery.I was out of the
city when he brought her to my house, you remember.But," turning
again to Carmen, "sing that song over, dear, please--the one you were
singing just now."Carmen seated herself again at the organ, and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles drew
her sister to the rear of the room."It will sound better back here,"
she explained.After the lapse of a few minutes she turned to Mrs."Belle," she
said, nodding her head sententiously, "you had a pearl, and you threw
it away.Her voice, and her
face--why, with our ward--this beautiful, gifted, South American owner
of a famous mine--as a lever, we can force the Beaubien to bring the
Ames to our terms!Meantime, the dainty Madam Elwin and the amiable Doctor Jurges in the
office below had reached a conclusion."A young lady of--ah--invincible
will," the doctor had observed; "and already--ah--decidedly mature,
despite her tender years.Should she--ah--assume leadership over the
pupils of your school, my dear Madam Elwin, the result might be
disquieting.There can be no question as to her religious views, as I
have said.But, what astonishes me is--ah--that this strange cult
should have its devotees even in the wilds of tropical America!The girl is utterly--ah--unevangelical,
Madam; and the advisability of removing her from the school can not be
questioned."By all means," asserted the latter gentleman with great seriousness,
while his eyes dwelt tenderly upon Madam Elwin's written order for a
hundred shares of Simiti stock which he held in his hand."Very well, then," said the lady with a determined nod of her head; "I
shall request Mrs.Then, with a proper sense
of what it meant to have the moral support of such an eminent divine
as Doctor Jurges, she rang for her maid and bade her summon Mrs.Thus it was that Carmen was again shifted a space on the checkerboard
of life, and slept that night once more under the spacious roof of the
wealthy relict of the late James Hawley-Crowles, on Riverside Drive.CHAPTER 7


As has been said, Carmen's six months in the Elwin school had been a
period of slow adjustment to the changed order.She had brought into
this new world a charm of unsophistication, an ingenuous _naivete_,
such as only an untrammeled spirit nourished in an elemental
civilization like that of primitive Simiti could develop.Added to
this was the zest and eagerness stimulated by the thought that she had
come as a message-bearer to a people with a great need.Her first
emotion had been that of astonishment that the dwellers in the great
States were not so different, after all, from those of her own
unprogressive country.Her next was one of sad disillusionment, as the
fact slowly dawned upon her trusting thought that the busy denizens of
her new environment took no interest whatsoever in her message.And
then her joy and brilliant hopefulness had chilled, and she awoke to
find her strange views a barrier between herself and her associates.She had brought to the America of the North a spirit so deeply
religious as to know naught else than her God and His ceaseless
manifestation.She had come utterly free of dogma or creed, and
happily ignorant of decaying formularies and religious caste.Her
Christianity was her demonstrable interpretation of the Master's
words; and her fresh, ebulliant spirit soared unhampered in the warm
atmosphere of love for mankind.Her concept of the Christ stirred no
thought within her of intolerance toward those who might hold
differing views; nor did it raise interposing barriers within her own
mind, nor evoke those baser sentiments which have so sadly warped the
souls of men into instruments of deadly hatred and crushing tyranny.Her spiritual vision, undimmed and world-embracing, saw the advent of
that day when all mankind would obey the commands of Jesus, and do the
works which he did, even to the complete spiritualization and
dematerializing of all human thought.And her burning desire was to
hasten the coming of that glad hour.The conviction that, despite its tremendous needs, humanity was
steadily rejecting, even in this great land of opportunity and
progress, the remedy for its consuming ills, came to her slowly.And
with it a damping of her ardor, and a dulling of the fine edge of her
enthusiasm.She grew quiet as the days passed, and drew away from her
companions into her thought.With her increasing sense of isolation
came at length a great longing to leave these inhospitable shores, and
return to her native environment and the sympathy and tender
solicitude of her beloved Rosendo and Padre Jose.Indeed, she could not be certain now of their
whereabouts.A great war was raging in Colombia, and she knew not what
fate had befallen her loved ones.To her many letters directed to
Simiti there had come back no reply.Even Harris, who had written
again and again to both Rosendo and Jose, had received no word from
them in return.Corroding fear began to assail the girl; soul-longing
and heart-sickness seized upon her; her happy smile faded; and her
bright, bubbling conversation ceased.Then one day, standing alone in her room, she turned squarely upon the
foul brood of evil suggestions crowding upon her and, as if they were
fell spirits from the nether world, bade them begone."I know you for what you are--_nothing_!You seemed to
use Padre Jose, but you can't use me!He is my life; and you, evil thoughts, can't make me think He isn't!I
am His image and likeness; I am His witness; and I will _not_ witness
to His opposite, evil!My life is filled with harmony; and you, evil
thoughts, can't reverse that fact!God has brought me here, else I
would not have come, for He is the cause of all that is.It is for me
to stand and see His glory.as she paced about the room and
seemed to ward off the assaults of an invisible enemy, "there is no
power apart from Him!Then, in the lull of battle, "Father divine, I thank Thee that Thou
hast heard me.And now I lay my all upon the altar of love, and throw
myself upon Thy thought."From that day, despite continued attacks from error--despite, too, the
veiled slights and covert insinuations of her schoolmates, to whom the
girl's odd views and utter refusal to share their accustomed
conversation, their interest in mundane affairs, their social
aspirations and worldly ambitions, at length made her quite
unwelcome--Carmen steadily, and without heed of diverting gesture,
brought into captivity every thought to the obedience of her
Christ-principle, and threw off for all time the dark cloud of
pessimism which human belief and the mesmerism of events had drawn
over her joyous spirit.Reed had not been near her since her enrollment in the school;
but Ketchim had visited her often--not, however, alone, but always
with one or more prospective purchasers of Simiti stock in tow whom
he sought to influence favorably through Carmen's interesting
conversation about her native land.Harris came every Sunday, and
the girl welcomed the great, blundering fellow as the coming of the
day.At times he would obtain Madam Elwin's permission to take the
girl up to the city on a little sight-seeing expedition, and then he
would abandon himself completely to the enjoyment of her naive wonder
and the numberless and often piquant questions stimulated by it.He
was the only one now with whom she felt any degree of freedom, and
in his presence her restraint vanished and her airy gaiety again
welled forth with all its wonted fervor.Once, shortly after Carmen
had been enrolled, Harris took her to a concert by the New York
Symphony Orchestra.But in the midst of the program, after sitting
in silent rapture, the girl suddenly burst into tears and begged to be
taken out.she sobbed as, outside the door,
she hid her tear-stained face in his coat; "I just couldn't!Oh, it was God that we heard--it was God!"And the
astonished fellow respected this sudden outburst of pent-up emotion
as he led her, silent and absorbed, back to the school.With the throwing of the girl upon her own thought came a rapid
expansion of both mind and body into maturity, and the young lady who
left the Elwin school that bright spring afternoon under the
protection of the self-sufficient Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was very far
from being the inquisitive, unabashed little girl who had so
greatly shocked the good Sister Superior by her heretical views
some six months before.The sophistication engendered by her
intercourse with the pupils and instructors in the school had
transformed the eager, trusting little maid, who could see only good
into a mature woman, who, though her trust remained unshaken,
nevertheless had a better understanding of the seeming power "that
lusteth against the spirit," and whose idea of her mission had been
deepened into a grave sense of responsibility.She saw now, as never
before, the awful unreality of the human sense of life; but she
likewise understood, as never previously, its seeming reality in
the human consciousness, and its terrible mesmeric power over
those materialistic minds into which the light of spirituality had as
yet scarcely penetrated.Her thought had begun to shape a definite
purpose; she was still to be a message-bearer, but the message must be
set forth in her life conduct.The futility of promiscuous verbal
delivery of the message to whomsoever might cross her path had
been made patent.She must do
likewise, and let her deeds attest the truth of her words.And from
the day that she bade the suggestions of fear and evil leave her,
she had consecrated herself anew to a searching study of the
Master's life and words, if happily she might acquire "that mind"
which he so wondrously expressed.But the assumption of an attitude of quiet demonstration was by no
means sudden.There were times when she could not restrain the impulse
to challenge the beliefs so authoritatively set forth by the preachers
and lecturers whom Madam Elwin invited to address her pupils, and who,
unlike Jesus, first taught, and then relegated their proofs to a life
beyond the grave.Once, shortly after entering the school, forgetful
of all but the error being preached, she had risen in the midst of an
eloquent sermon by the eminent Darius Borwell, a Presbyterian divine
of considerable repute, and asked him why it was that, as he seemed to
set forth, God had changed His mind after creating spiritual man, and
had created a man of dust.She had later repented her scandalous
conduct in sackcloth and ashes; but it did not prevent her from
abruptly leaving the chapel on a subsequent Sunday when another
divine, this time a complaisant Methodist, quite satisfied with his
theories of endless future rewards and fiery punishments, dwelt at
length upon the traditional idea that the sorrows of the world are
God-sent for mankind's chastisement and discipline.Then she gradually learned to be less defiant of the conventions and
beliefs of the day, and determined quietly to rise superior to them.But her experience with the preachers wrought within her a strong
determination henceforth to listen to no religious propaganda
whatsoever, to give no further heed to current theological beliefs,
and to enter no church edifice, regardless of the tenets of the sect
worshiping within its precincts.The wisdom of this decision she left
for the future to determine."Oh," she cried, "my only mission is to manifest the divine, not to
waste time listening to the theories of ignorant preachers, who fail
utterly to prove the truth of their teachings!Oh, how the world needs
love--just love!And I am going to love it with the selfless love that
comes from God, and destroys error and the false beliefs that become
externalized in the human consciousness as sickness, failure, old
age, and death!Love, love, love--it is mankind's greatest need!Why,
if the preachers only knew, the very heart and soul of Christianity is
love!It is love that casts out fear; and fear is at the bottom of all
sickness, for fear leads to belief in other gods than the one Father
of Christ Jesus!Oh, God--take me
out into the world, and let me show it what love can do!"And the divine ear heard the call of this beautiful disciple of the
Christ--aye, had heard it long before the solicitous, fluttering
little Madam Elwin decided that the strange girl's unevangelical views
were inimical to the best interests of her very select school.Hawley-Crowles threw wide the
portals of the world to Carmen, and she entered, wide-eyed and
wondering.Nor did she return until the deepest recesses of the human
mind had revealed to her their abysmal hideousness, their ghastly
emptiness of reality, and their woeful mesmeric deception.James Hawley-Crowles, more keenly perceptive than her sister, had
seized upon Carmen with avidity bred of hope long deferred.The
scourge of years of fruitless social striving had rendered her
desperate, and she would have staged a ballet on her dining table,
with her own ample self as _premiere danseuse_, did the attraction but
promise recognition from the blase members of fashionable New York's
ultra-conservative set.From childhood she had looked eagerly forward
through the years with an eye single to such recognition as life's
desideratum.To this end she had bartered both youth and beauty with
calculated precision for the Hawley-Crowles money bags; only to weep
floods of angry tears when the bargain left her social status
unchanged, and herself tied to a decrepit old rounder, whose tarnished
name wholly neutralized the purchasing power of his ill-gotten gold.Fortunately for the reputations of them both, her husband had the good
sense to depart this life ere the divorce proceedings which she had
long had in contemplation were instituted; whereupon the stricken
widow had him carefully incinerated and his ashes tenderly deposited
in a chaste urn in a mausoleum which her architect had taken oath cost
more than the showy Ames vault by many thousands.The period of
decorous mourning past, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles blithely doffed her weeds
and threw herself again into the terrific competition for social
standing, determined this time that it should be a warfare to the
death.And so it bade fair to prove to her, when the eminent nerve
specialist, Dr.Bascom Ross, giving a scant half hour to the
consideration of her case, at the modest charge of one hundred
dollars, warned her to declare a truce and flee to the Alps for
unalloyed rest.She complied, and had returned with restored health
and determination just as her sister came up from South America,
bringing the odd little "savage" whom Reed had discovered in the wilds
of Guamoco.A prolonged week-end at Newport, the last of the summer
season, accounted for her absence from the city when Reed brought
Carmen to her house, where he and his wife were making their temporary
abode.Six months later, in her swift appraisal of the girl in the
Elwin school, to whom she had never before given a thought, she seemed
to see a light."It does look like a desperate chance, I admit," she said, when
recounting her plans to her sister a day or so later."But I've played
every other card in my hand; and now this girl is going to be either a
trump or a joker.All we need is a word from the Beaubien, and the
following week will see an invitation at our door from Mrs.The trick is to reach the Beaubien.And I'm going to introduce the girl as an Inca
princess.Reed was not less ambitious than her sister, but hitherto she had
lacked the one essential to social success, money.In addition, she
had committed the egregious blunder of marrying for love.And now that
the honeymoon had become a memory, and she faced again her growing
ambition, with a struggling husband who had neither name nor wealth to
aid her, she had found her own modest income of ten thousand a year,
which she had inherited from her mother, only an aggravation.True, in
time her wandering father would pass away; and there was no doubt that
his vast property would fall to his daughters, his only living kin.But at present, in view of his aggressively good health and disregard
for his relatives, her only recourse was to attach herself to her
wealthy, sharp-witted sister, and hope to be towed safely into the
social swim, should that scheming lady ultimately achieve her high
ambition.Hawley-Crowles should have seen in Carmen a means of
reaching a woman of the stamp of the Beaubien, and through her the
leader of the most exclusive social set in the metropolis, is
difficult to say.But thus does the human mind often seek to further
its own dubious aims through guileless innocence and trust.Hawley-Crowles had likewise a slight trace of that clairvoyance
of wisdom which so characterized the girl.But with this difference,
that she knew not why she was led to adopt certain means; while
Carmen, penetrating externals, consciously sought to turn those who
would employ her into channels for the expression of her own dominant
thought.Be that as it may, the Beaubien was now the stone before the
door of their hope, and Carmen the lever by which these calculating
women intended it should be moved."The Beaubien, my dear," explained Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to her
inquisitive sister, whose life had been lived almost entirely away
from New York, "is J. Wilton Ames's very particular friend, of long
standing.As I told you, I have recently been going through my late
unpleasant husband's effects, and have unearthed letters and memoranda
which throw floods of light upon Jim's early indiscretions and his
association with both the Beaubien and Ames.Jim once told me, in a
burst of alcoholic confidence, that she had saved him from J. Wilton's
clutches in the dim past, and for that he owed her endless gratitude,
as well as for never permitting him to darken her door again.Now I
have never met the Beaubien.But I dare say she knows
all about us.However, the point that concerns us now is this: she has
a hold on Ames, and, unless rumor is wide of the truth, when she hints
to him that his wife's dinner list or yachting party seems incomplete
without such or such a name, why, the list is immediately revised."The position which the Beaubien held was, if Madam On-dit was not to
be wholly discredited, to say the least, unique.It was not as social
dictator that she posed, for in a great cosmopolitan city where polite
society is infinitely complex in its make-up such a position can
scarcely be said to exist.It was rather as an influence that she was
felt, an influence never seen, but powerful, subtle, and wholly
inexplicable, working now through this channel, now through that, and
effecting changes in the social complexion of conservative New York
that were utterly in defiance of the most rigid convention.Particularly was her power felt in the narrow circle over which Mrs.J. Wilton Ames presided, by reason of her own and her husband's
aristocratic descent, and the latter's bursting coffers and supremacy
in the realm of finance.Only for her sagacity, the great influence of the woman would have
been short-lived.But, whatever else might be said of her, the
Beaubien was wise, with a discretion that was positively uncanny.Tall, voluptuous, yet graceful as a fawn; black, wavy, abundant hair;
eyes whose dark, liquid depths held unfathomable mysteries; gracious,
affable, yet keen as a razor blade; tender, even sentimental on
occasions, with an infinite capacity for either love or hate, this
many-sided woman, whose brilliant flashes of wit kept the savant or
roue at her table in an uproar, could, if occasion required, found an
orphanage or drop a bichloride tablet in the glass of her rival with
the same measure of calculating precision and disdain of the future.It was said of her that she might have laid down her life for the man
she loved.It is probable that she never met with one worth the
sacrifice.While yet in short dresses she had fled from her boarding school, near
a fashionable resort in the New Hampshire hills, with a French
Colonel, Gaspard de Beaubien, a man twice her age.With him she had
spent eight increasingly miserable years in Paris.Then, her withered
romance carefully entombed in the secret places of her heart, she
secured a divorce from the roistering colonel, together with a small
settlement, and set sail for New York to hunt for larger and more
valuable game.With abundant charms and sang-froid for her capital, she rented an
expensive apartment in a fashionable quarter of the city, and then
settled down to business.Whether she would have fallen upon bad days
or not will never be known, for the first haul of her widespread net
landed a fish of supreme quality, J. Wilton Ames.On the plea of
financial necessity, she had gone boldly to his office with the deed
to a parcel of worthless land out on the moist sands of the New Jersey
shore, which the unscrupulous Gaspard de Beaubien had settled upon her
when she severed the tie which bound them, and which, after weeks of
careful research, she discovered adjoined a tract owned by Ames.Pushing aside office boy, clerk, and guard, she reached the inner
_sanctum_ of the astonished financier himself and offered to sell at a
ruinous figure.A few well-timed tears, an expression of angelic
innocence on her beautiful face, a despairing gesture or two with her
lovely arms, coupled with the audacity which she had shown in forcing
an entrance into his office, effected the man's capitulation.She was
then in her twenty-fourth year.The result was that she cast her net no more, but devoted herself
thenceforth with tender consecration to her important catch.In time
Ames brought a friend, the rollicking James Hawley-Crowles, to call
upon the charming Beaubien.In time, too, as was perfectly natural, a
rivalry sprang up between the men, which the beautiful creature
watered so tenderly that the investments which she was enabled to make
under the direction of these powerful rivals flourished like Jack's
beanstalk, and she was soon able to leave her small apartment and take
a suite but a few blocks from the Ames mansion.At length the strain between Ames and Hawley-Crowles reached the
breaking point; and then the former decided that the woman's
bewitching smiles should thenceforth be his alone.He forthwith drew
the seldom sober Hawley-Crowles into certain business deals, with the
gentle connivance of the suave Beaubien herself, and at length sold
the man out short and presented a claim on every dollar he possessed.Hawley-Crowles awoke from his blissful dream sober and trimmed.But
then the Beaubien experienced one of her rare and inexplicable
revulsions of the ethical sense, and a compromise had to be effected,
whereby the Hawley-Crowles fortune was saved, though the man should
see the Beaubien no more.By this time her beauty was blooming in its utmost profusion, and her
prowess had been fairly tried.She took a large house, furnished it
like unto a palace, and proceeded to throw her gauntlet in the face of
the impregnable social caste.There she drew about her a circle of
bon-vivants, artists, litterateurs, politicians, and men of
finance--with never a woman in the group.Yet in her new home she
established a social code as rigid as the Median law, and woe to him
within her gates who thereafter, with or without intent, passed the
bounds of respectful decorum.His name was heard no more on her rosy
lips.Her dinners were Lucullan in their magnificence; and over the rare
wines and imperial cigars which she furnished, her guests passed many
a tip and prognostication anent the market, which she in turn quietly
transmitted to her brokers.She came to understand the game
thoroughly, and, while it was her heyday of glorious splendor, she
played hard.She had bartered every priceless gift of nature for
gold--and she made sure that the measure she received in return was
full.Her gaze was ever upon the approaching day when those charms
would be but bitter memories; and it was her grim intention that when
it came silken ease should compensate for their loss.Ten years passed, and the Beaubien's reign continued with undimmed
splendor.In the meantime, the wife of J. Wilton Ames had reached the
zenith of her ambitions and was the acknowledged leader in New York's
most fashionable social circle.But, though
the Beaubien had never sought the entree to formal society, preferring
to hold her own court, at which no women attended, she exercised a
certain control over it through her influence upon the man Ames.Ames knew of the long-continued relations between her husband and
this woman was never divulged.And doubtless she was wholly satisfied
that his wealth and power afforded her the position which her heart
had craved; and, that secure, she was willing to leave him to his own
methods of obtaining diversion.But rumor was persistent, maliciously
so; and rumor declared that the list of this envied society dame was
not drawn up without the approval of her husband and the woman with
whom his leisure hours were invariably spent.Hawley-Crowles, whose doting mate had once fawned in the perfumed wake
of the luxurious Beaubien.Carmen, whose wishes had not been consulted, had voiced no objection
whatever to returning to the Hawley-Crowles home.Indeed, she secretly
rejoiced that an opportunity had been so easily afforded for escape
from the stifling atmosphere of the Elwin school, and for entrance
into the great world of people and affairs, where she believed the
soil prepared for the seed she would plant.That dire surprises
awaited her, of which she could not even dream, did not enter her
calculations.Secure in her quenchless faith, she gladly accepted the
proffered shelter of the Hawley-Crowles mansion, and the protection of
its worldly, scheming inmates.In silent, wide-eyed wonder, in the days that followed, the girl
strove to accustom herself to the luxury of her surroundings, and to
the undreamed of marvels which made for physical comfort and
well-being.Hawley-Crowles settled upon her seemed a fortune--enough, she thought,
to buy the whole town of Simiti!Her gowns seemed woven on fairy
looms, and often she would sit for hours, holding them in her lap and
reveling in their richness.Then, when at length she could bring
herself to don the robes and peep timidly into the great pier glasses,
she would burst into startled exclamations and hide her face in her
hands, lest the gorgeous splendor of the beautiful reflection
overpower her."Oh," she would exclaim, "it can't be that the girl reflected there
ever lived and dressed as I did in Simiti!I wonder, oh, I wonder if
Padre Jose knew that these things were in the world!"And then, as she leaned back in her chair and gave herself into the
hands of the admiring French maid, she would close her eyes and dream
that the fairy-stories which the patient Jose had told her again and
again in her distant home town had come true, and that she had been
transformed into a beautiful princess, who would some day go in search
of the sleeping priest and wake him from his mesmeric dream.Then would come the inevitable thought of the little newsboy of
Cartagena, to whom she had long since begun to send monetary
contributions--and of her unanswered letters--of the war devastating
her native land--of rudely severed ties, and unimaginable changes--and
she would start from her musing and brush away the gathering tears,
and try to realize that her present situation and environment were but
means to an end, opportunities which her God had given her to do His
work, with no thought of herself.A few days after Carmen had been installed in her new home, during
which she had left the house only for her diurnal ride in the big
limousine, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles announced her readiness to fire the
first gun in the attack upon the Beaubien."My dear," she said to her
sister, as they sat alone in the luxurious sun-parlor, "my washerwoman
dropped a remark the other day which gave me something to build on.Her two babies are in the General Orphan Asylum, up on Twenty-third
street.Well, it happens that this institution is the Beaubien's sole
charity--in fact, it is her particular hobby.I presume that she feels
she is now a middle-aged woman, and that the time is not far distant
when she will have to close up her earthly accounts and hand them over
to the heavenly auditor.Anyway, this last year or two she has
suddenly become philanthropic, and when the General Orphan Asylum was
building she gave some fifty thousand dollars for a cottage in her
name.What's more, the trustees of the Asylum accepted it without the
wink of an eyelash."But here's the point: some rich old fellow has willed the institution
a fund whose income every year is used to buy clothing for the
kiddies; and they have a sort of celebration on the day the duds are
given out, and the public is invited to inspect the place and the
inmates, and eat a bit, and look around generally.Well, my
washerwoman tells me that the Beaubien always attends these annual
celebrations.The next one, I learn, comes in about a month.I propose
that we attend; take Carmen; ask permission for her to sing to the
children, and thereby attract the attention of the gorgeous Beaubien,
who will be sure to speak to the girl, who is herself an orphan, and,
ten to one, want to see more of her.I'll have a
word to say regarding our immense debt of gratitude to her for saving
Jim's fortune years ago when he was entangled in her net--and, well,
if that scheme doesn't work, I have other strings to my bow."But it did work, and with an ease that exceeded the most sanguine
hopes of its projector.On the day that the General Orphan Asylum
threw wide its doors to the public, the Hawley-Crowles limousine
rubbed noses with the big French car of the Beaubien in the street
without; while within the building the Beaubien held the hand of the
beautiful girl whose voluntary singing had spread a veil of silence
over the awed spectators in the great assembly room, and, looking
earnestly down into the big, trusting, brown eyes, said: "My dear
child, I want to know you."Then, turning to the eager, itching Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I shall send my car for her to-morrow afternoon, with
your permission."Hawley-Crowles wildly hugged her
sister and the girl all the way home--then went to bed that night with
tears of apprehension in her washed-out eyes, lest she had shown
herself too eager in granting the Beaubien's request.But her fears
were turned to exultation when the Beaubien car drew up at her door
the following day at three, and the courteous French chauffeur
announced his errand.A few moments later, while the car glided
purring over the smooth asphalt, Carmen, robed like a princess, lay
back in the cushions and dreamed of the poor priest in the dead little
town so far away.CHAPTER 9


"Sing it again, dear.I know you are tired, but I want to hear that
song just once more.Somehow it seems to bring up thoughts of--of
things that might have been."The Beaubien's voice sank to a whisper
as she finished.Carmen laughed happily and prepared to repeat the weird lament which
had so fascinated the Reverend Doctor Jurges a few days before."I--I don't know why that song affects me so," mused the Beaubien,
when the girl had finished and returned to the seat beside her.Then,
abruptly: "I wish you could play the pipe-organ out in the hall.I put
twelve thousand dollars into it, and I can't even play five-finger
exercises on it."exclaimed Carmen, drawing a long breath,
while her eyes dilated."Well, you poor, unsophisticated girl, suppose we just go down there
and buy the whole town.It would at least give me an interest in life.Do you think I could stand the heat there?How did you live, and what did you do?And are
you really descended from the old Incas?"They were alone in the darkened music room, and the soft-stepping,
liveried butler had just set the tea table before them, At one end of
the long room a cheery fire snapped and crackled in the huge
fireplace, tempering the sharpness of the early spring day and casting
a ruddy glow upon the tapestried walls and polished floor in front,
where dozed the Beaubien's two "babies," Japanese and Pekingese
spaniels of registered pedigree and fabulous value.Among the heavy
beams of the lofty ceiling grotesque shadows danced and flickered,
while over the costly rugs and rare skins on the floor below subdued
lights played in animated pantomime.Behind the magnificent grand
piano a beautifully wrought harp reflected a golden radiance into the
room.Everything in the woman's environment was softened into the same
degree of voluptuousness which characterized her and the life of
sybaritic ease which she affected.From the moment Carmen entered the house she had been charmed,
fascinated, overpowered by the display of exhaustless wealth and
the rich taste exhibited in its harmonious manifestation.The
Hawley-Crowles home had seemed to her the epitome of material
elegance and comfort, far exceeding the most fantastic concepts of her
childish imagination, when she had listened enraptured to Padre
Jose's compelling stories of the great world beyond Simiti.But the
gorgeous web of this social spider made even the Hawley-Crowles
mansion suffer in comparison."And yet," said the amused Beaubien, when Carmen could no longer
restrain her wonder and admiration, "this is but a shed beside the new
Ames house, going up on Fifth Avenue.I presume he will put not less
than ten millions into it before it is finished."Carmen dared not attempt to grasp the
complex significance of such an expenditure."Why, is that such a huge amount, child?"asked the Beaubien, as
accustomed to think in eight figures as in two."But, I forget that
you are from the jungle.she mused, gazing
with undisguised admiration at the beautiful, animated girl before
her.Carmen was struggling with the
deluge of new impressions; and the woman fastened her eyes upon her as
if she would have them bore deep into the soul of whose rarity she was
becoming slowly aware.What thoughts coursed through the mind of the
Beaubien as she sat studying the girl through the tempered light, we
may not know.What she saw in Carmen that attracted her, she herself
might not have told.Had she, too, this ultra-mondaine, this creature
of gold and tinsel, felt the spell of the girl's great innocence and
purity of thought, her righteousness?Or did she see in her something
that she herself might once have been--something that all her gold,
and all the wealth of Ormus or of Ind could never buy?"What have you got," she suddenly, almost rudely, exclaimed, "that I
haven't?"And then the banality of the question struck her, and she
laughed harshly."Why," said Carmen, looking up quickly and beaming upon the woman,
"you have everything!"You," returned the woman quickly, though she knew not why she said
it.And yet, memory was busy uncovering those bitter days when, in the
first agony of marital disappointment, she had, with hot, streaming
tears, implored heaven to give her a child.But the gift had been
denied; and her heart had shrunk and grown heavily calloused.Then she spoke more gently, and there was that in her voice which
stirred the girl's quick sympathy."Yes, you have youth, and beauty.But I could part with them, gladly, if only
there were anything left."Carmen instantly rose and went swiftly to her.Forgetful of caste,
decorum, convention, everything but the boundless love which she felt
for all mankind, she put her arms about the worldly woman's neck and
kissed her.For a moment the Beaubien sat in speechless surprise.It was the only
manifestation of selfless love that had ever come into her sordid
experience.that it was an
act of real sympathy, and not a clever ruse to win her from behind the
mask of affection?Her own kisses, she knew, were bestowed only for
favors.they drew not many now, although time was when a single
one might win a brooch or a string of pearls.The girl herself quickly met the woman's groping thought."I'm in the
world to show what love will do," she murmured; "and I love you."Had
she not thus solved every problem from earliest childhood?Not even a heart of stone could withstand the
solvent power of such love.Her head dropped upon her breast, and she
wept."Don't cry," said Carmen, tenderly caressing the bepowdered cheek."Why, we are all God's children; we all have one another; you have me,
and I have you; and God means us all to be happy."The Beaubien looked up, wondering.Her variegated life included no
such tender experience as this.She had long since ceased to shed
aught but tears of anger.But now--

She clutched the girl to her and kissed her eagerly; then gently
motioned her back to her chair."Don't mind it," she smiled, with
swimming eyes, and a shade of embarrassment."I don't know of anything
that would help me as much as a good cry.If I could have had a
daughter like you, I should--but never mind now."She tried to laugh,
as she wiped her eyes.Then an idea seemed to flash through her jaded brain, and she became
suddenly animated."Why--listen," she said; "don't you want to learn
the pipe-organ?I will pay for
them; I will engage the best teacher in New York; and you shall take
two or three a week, and use the big organ out in the hall.Carmen's heart gave a great leap."I'll do it myself," returned the woman with growing enthusiasm."William," she directed, when the butler responded to her summons,
"get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles on the wire at once.But who is coming, I
wonder?"glancing through the window at an automobile that had drawn
up at her door.a look of vexation mantling her face, "the
Right Reverend Monsignor Lafelle.Well," turning to Carmen, "I suppose
I'll have to send you home now, dear.Hawley-Crowles
that I shall call for you to-morrow afternoon, and that I shall speak
to her at that time about your music lessons.William, take Monsignor
into the morning room, and then tell Henri to bring the car to the
porte-cochere for Miss Carmen.Good-bye, dear," kissing the bright,
upturned face of the waiting girl."I wish I could--but, well, don't
forget that I'm coming for you to-morrow."Hawley-Crowles directed her French tailor to cable
to Paris for advance styles.Twenty-four hours later she hastened with
outstretched arms to greet the Beaubien, waiting in the reception
room.Oh, yes, they had heard often of each other; and now were so
pleased to meet!New York was such a whirlpool, and it was so
difficult to form desirable friendships.Yes, the Beaubien had known
the late-lamented Hawley-Crowles; but, dear!that was years and
years ago, before he had married, and when they were both young and
foolish.Hawley-Crowles, chance enabled him and me to be mutually
helpful at a time when I was in sore need of a friend; and the debt of
gratitude is not yours to me, but mine to your kind husband."Hawley-Crowles could have hugged her on the spot.What cared she
that her husband's always unsavory name had been linked with this
woman's?She had married the roistering blade for his bank account
only.Any other male whose wealth ran into seven figures would have
done as well, or better.Hawley-Crowles gratefully
accepted the use of the organ and the Beaubien mansion for the girl;
but she herself insisted upon bearing the expense of the lessons.Together, she and the Beaubien,
they would foster and develop it.Moreover, though of course this must
follow later, she intended to give the girl every social advantage
befitting her beauty, her talents, and her station.And then, when the Beaubien, who knew to a second just how long to
stay, had departed, taking Carmen with her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles turned
to her sister with her face flushed with anger.she exclaimed, while hot tears suffused her eyes."The hussy went away
actually laughing at me!What do you suppose she's got up her sleeve?But, let me tell you, she'll not fool me!I'll slap that arrogant Ames
woman yet; and then, when I've done that, I'll give the Beaubien
something to think about besides the way she did up poor old Jim!"*       *       *       *       *

There was now but one cloud that cast its dark shadow across the full
splendor of Carmen's happiness, the silence that shrouded Simiti.But
Harris was preparing to return to Colombia, and his trip promised a
solution of the mystery of her unanswered letters.For weeks Carmen
had struggled to teach him Spanish, with but small measure of success."You'll have to go back with me and
act as interpreter," he said one day, when they were alone in the
Hawley-Crowles parlor.Then a curious light came into his eyes, and he
blurted, "Will you?"But the girl turned the question aside with a laugh, though she knew
not from what depths it had sprung.Harris shrugged his broad
shoulders and sighed.He had not a hundred dollars to his name.Yet he had prospects, not the least of which was the interest he
shared with Reed in La Libertad.For, despite the disturbed state of
affairs in Colombia, Simiti stock had sold rapidly, under the sedulous
care of Ketchim and his loyal aids, and a sufficient fund had been
accumulated to warrant the inauguration of development work on the
mine.A few years hence Harris should be rich from that source alone.Reed was still in California, although the alluring literature which
Ketchim was scattering broadcast bore his name as consulting engineer
to the Simiti Development Company.His wife had continued her
temporary abode in the Hawley-Crowles mansion, while awaiting with
what fortitude she could command the passing of her still vigorous
father, and the results of her defiant sister's assaults upon the Ames
set.The wonderful organ in the Beaubien
mansion had cast a spell of enchantment over her soul, and daily she
sat before it, uncovering new marvels and losing herself deeper and
deeper in its infinite mysteries.Her progress was commensurate with
her consecration, and brought exclamations of astonishment to the lips
of her now devoted Beaubien.Hour after hour the latter would sit in
the twilight of the great hall, with her eyes fastened upon the
absorbed girl, and her leaden soul slowly, painfully struggling to
lift itself above the murk and dross in which it had lain buried for
long, meaningless years.They now talked but little, this strange
woman and the equally strange girl.Their communion was no longer of
the lips.It was the silent yearning of a dry, desolate heart,
striving to open itself to the love which the girl was sending far and
wide in the quenchless hope that it might meet just such a need.For
Carmen dwelt in the spirit, and she instinctively accepted her
splendid material environment as the gift, not of man, but of the
great divine Mind, which had led her into this new world that she
might be a channel for the expression of its love to the erring
children of mortals.She came and went quietly, and yet with as much confidence as if the
house belonged to her.At first the Beaubien smiled indulgently.And
then her smile became a laugh of eager joy as she daily greeted her
radiant visitor, whose entrance into the great, dark house was always
followed by a flood of sunshine, and whose departure marked the
setting in of night to the heart-hungry woman.In the first days of
their association the Beaubien could turn easily from the beautiful
girl to the group of cold, scheming men of the world who filled her
evenings and sat about her board.But as days melted into weeks, she
became dimly conscious of an effort attaching to the transition; and
the hour at length arrived when she fully realized that she was facing
the most momentous decision that had ever been evolved by her worldly
mode of living.But that was a matter of slow development through many
months.Hawley-Crowles trod the clouds.A week after Carmen
began the study of the organ she boldly ventured to accompany her one
day to the Beaubien citadel.She was graciously received, and departed
with the Beaubien's promise to return the call.Thereupon she set
about revising her own social list, and dropped several names which
she now felt could serve her no longer.Her week-end at Newport, just
prior to her visit to the Elwin school, had marked the close of the
gay season in the city, and New York had entered fully upon its summer
_siesta_.Even the theaters and concert halls were closed, and the
metropolis was nodding its weary head dully and sinking into
somnolence.The
summer interim would give her time to further her plans and prepare
the girl for her social _debut_ in the early winter."And Milady Ames
will be mentioned in the papers next day as assisting at the
function--the cat!"she muttered savagely, as she laid aside her
revised list of social desirables.But in preparing Carmen that summer for her subsequent entry into
polite society Mrs.Hawley-Crowles soon realized that she had
assumed a task of generous proportions.In the first place,
despite all efforts, the girl could not be brought to a proper
sense of money values.Her eyes were ever gaping in astonishment at
what Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister regarded as the most moderate
of expenditures, and it was only when the Beaubien herself mildly
hinted to them that ingenuousness was one of the girl's greatest
social assets, that they learned to smile indulgently at her wonder,
even while inwardly pitying her dense ignorance and lack of
sophistication.A second source of trial to her guardians was her delicate sense of
honor; and it was this that one day nearly sufficed to wreck their
standing with the fashionable Mrs.Gannette of Riverside Drive, a
pompous, bepowdered, curled and scented dame, anaemic of mind, but
tremendously aristocratic, and of scarcely inferior social dignity to
that of the envied Mrs.Gannette moved into the
neighborhood where dwelt the ambitious Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the latter
was taken by a mutual acquaintance to call upon her, and was
immediately received into the worldly old lady's good graces.And it
so happened that, after the gay season had closed that summer, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister to an informal
afternoon of bridge, and especially requested that they bring their
young ward, whose beauty and wonderful story were, through the
discreet maneuvers of her guardians, beginning to be talked about.Hawley-Crowles had been inducting Carmen
into the mysteries of the game; but with indifferent success, for the
girl's thoughts invariably were elsewhere engaged.On this particular
afternoon Carmen was lost in contemplation of the gorgeous dress, the
lavish display of jewelry, and the general inanity of conversation;
and her score was pitiably low.The following morning, to her great
astonishment, she received a bill from the practical Mrs.Gannette for
ten dollars to cover her losses at the game.For a long time the
bewildered girl mused over it.Then she called the chauffeur and
despatched him to the Gannette mansion with the money necessary to
meet the gambling debt, and three dollars additional to pay for the
refreshments she had eaten, accompanying it with a polite little note
of explanation.The result was an explosion that nearly lifted the asphalt from the
Drive; and Carmen, covered with tears and confusion, was given to
understand by the irate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles that her conduct was as
reprehensible as if she had attacked the eminent Mrs.Whereupon the sorrowing Carmen packed her effects and prepared to
depart from the presence of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, to the terrified
consternation of the latter, who alternately prostrated herself before
the girl and the offended Mrs.Gannette, and at length, after many
days of perspiring effort and voluminous explanation, succeeded in
restoring peace.When the Beaubien, who had become the girl's confidante, learned the
story, she laughed till her sides ached.And then her lips set, and
her face grew terribly hard, and she muttered, "Fools!"But she smiled
again as she gathered the penitent girl in her arms, and kissed her."You will learn many things, dearie, before you are through with New
York.And," she added, her brow again clouding, "you _will_ be through
with it--some day!"That evening she repeated the story at her table, and Gannette, who
happened to be present, swore between roars of laughter that he would
use it as a club over his wife, should she ever again trap him in any
of his numerous indiscretions.Again, the girl's odd views of life and its meaning which, despite her
efforts, she could not refrain from voicing now and then, caused the
worldly Mrs.Hawley-Crowles much consternation.Carmen tried
desperately to be discreet.Even Harris advised her to listen much,
but say little; and she strove hard to obey.But she would forget and
hurl the newspapers from her with exclamations of horror over their
red-inked depictions of mortal frailty--she would flatly refuse to
discuss crime or disease--and she would comment disparagingly at too
frequent intervals on the littleness of human aims and the emptiness
of the peacock-life which she saw manifested about her."I don't
understand--I can't," she would say, when she was alone with the
Beaubien."Why, with the wonderful opportunities which you rich people
have, how can you--oh, how can you toss them aside for the frivolities
and littleness that you all seem to be striving for!It seems to me
you must be mad--_loco_!And I know you are, for you are simply
mesmerized!"Then the Beaubien would smile knowingly and take her in her arms."We
shall see," she would often say, "we shall see."Thus the summer months sped swiftly past, with Carmen ever looking and
listening, receiving, sifting, in, but not of, the new world into
which she had been cast.In a sense her existence was as narrowly
routined as ever it had been in Simiti, for her days were spent at the
great organ, with frequent rides in the automobile through the parks
and boulevards for variation; and her evenings were jealously guarded
by Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose policy was to keep the girl in seclusion
until the advent of her formal introduction to the world of
fashionable society, when her associates would be selected only from
the narrow circle of moneyed or titled people with whom alone she
might mingle.To permit her to form promiscuous acquaintances now
might prove fatal to the scheming woman's cherished plans, and was a
risk that could not be entertained.And Carmen, suppressing her
wonder, and striving incessantly to curb her ready tongue, accepted
her environment as the unreal expression of the human mind, and
submitted--and waited.CHAPTER 10

The chill blasts had begun to swoop down from the frozen North, and
summer had gathered her dainty robes about her and fled shivering
before them.Hawley-Crowles stood at a window and gazed with
unseeing eyes at the withered leaves tossing in the wind.Carmen's sixteenth birthday was past by some months; the gay season
was at hand; and the day was speeding toward her which she had set for
the girl's formal _debut_.Already, through informal calls and
gatherings, she had made her charming and submissive ward known to
most of her own city acquaintances and the members of her particular
set.The fresh, beautiful girl's winning personality; her frank,
ingenuous manner; her evident sincerity and her naive remarks, which
now only gave hints of her radical views, had opened every heart wide
to her, and before the advent of the social season her wonderful story
was on everybody's tongue.There remained now only the part which the
woman had planned for the Beaubien, but which, thus far, she had found
neither the courage nor the opportunity to suggest to that influential
woman.Gazing out into the deserted street, she stamped her ample foot
in sheer vexation.The Beaubien had absorbed Carmen; had been
politely affable to her and her sister; had called twice during the
summer; and had said nothing.The
hint must come from the other side; and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles could have
wept with chagrin as she reflected gloomily on her own timorous
spirit.But as she stood in dejection before the window a vague idea flitted
into her brain, and she clutched at it desperately.Carmen had spoken
of the frequent calls of a certain Monsignor Lafelle at the Beaubien
mansion, although the girl had never met him."Old Gaspard de Beaubien was a
French Catholic."Nothing--except--why, to be sure,
the girl came from a Catholic country, and therefore was a Catholic!That was worth developing a little
further."Let us see," she reflected, "Kathleen Ames is coming out
this winter, too.Candidate for her mother's
social position, of course.The Reverend Darius Borwell, D.D., L.L.D., and any other D. that will
keep him glued to his ten-thousand-dollar salary, hooked them early in
the game.Now suppose--suppose Lafelle should tell the Beaubien
that--that there's--no, that won't do!But suppose I tell him that
here's a chance for him to back a Catholic against a Protestant for
the highest social honors in New York--Carmen versus Kathleen--what
would he say?I'm just as good a Catholic as Protestant.And Catholic, Methodist, or Hard-shell
Baptist, as suited his needs.Suppose I should tip
it off to Lafelle that I'm smitten with the pious intention of
donating an altar to Holy Saints Cathedral in memory of my late,
unlamented consort--what then?Yes,
it's not a bad idea at all."And thus it was that a few days later Mrs.Hawley-Crowles timed it so
carefully that she chanced to call on the Beaubien with Carmen shortly
after Monsignor Lafelle's car had pulled up at the same door.It was
the merest accident, too, that Carmen led her puffing guardian
directly into the morning room, where sat the Beaubien and Monsignor
in earnest conversation.Hawley-Crowles would have retired at
once, stammering apologies, and reprimanding Carmen for her assumption
of liberties in another's house; but the Beaubien was grace and
cordiality itself, and she insisted on retaining her three callers and
making them mutually acquainted.Hawley-Crowles found it easy to take
the contemplated plunge.Therefore she smiled triumphantly when, a
week later, Monsignor Lafelle alighted at her own door, in response to
a summons on matters pertaining to the Church."But, Madam," replied the holy man, after carefully listening to her
announcement, "I can only refer the matter to the Bishop.I am not
connected with this diocese.But I
shall be most pleased to lay it before him, with my endorsement.""As you say, Monsignor," sweetly responded the gracious Mrs."I sought your advice because I had met you through my
dear friend, Madam Beaubien.""It has been a great pleasure to know you and to be of service to you,
Madam," said Monsignor, rising to depart."But," he added with a
tender smile, "a pleasure that would be enhanced were you to become
one of us."Hawley-Crowles knew that at last the time had come."A moment,
please, Monsignor," she said, her heart beating quickly.It concerns my ward, the young girl
whom you met at Madam Beaubien's.""And just
budding into still more beautiful womanhood."Then she threw herself precipitately into her
topic, as if she feared further delay would result in the evaporation
of her boldness."Monsignor, it is, as you say, unfortunate that I
profess no religious convictions; and yet, as I have told you, I find
that as the years pass I lean ever more strongly toward your Church.Now you will pardon me when I say that I am sure it is the avowed
intention to make America dominantly Catholic that brings you to this
country to work toward that end--is it not so?"The man's handsome face lighted up pleasantly, but he did not reply."Now, Monsignor, I am going to be terribly frank; and if you
disapprove of what I suggest, we will both forget that the matter was
ever under discussion.To begin with, I heartily endorse your
missionary efforts in this godless country of ours.Nothing but the
strong arm of the Catholic Church, it seems to me, can check our
headlong plunge into ruin.But, Monsignor, you do not always work
where your labors are most needed.You may control political--"

"My dear lady," interrupted the man, holding up a hand and shaking his
head in gentle demurral, "the Catholic Church is not in politics.""But it is in society--or should be!""And
if the Catholic Church is to be supreme in America it must work from
the top down, as well as from the lower levels upward.At present our
wealthiest, most influential social set is absolutely domineered by a
Protestant--and under the influence of a Presbyterian minister at
that!Monsignor Lafelle's eyes twinkled, as he listened politely.But he
only stroked the white hair that crowned his shapely head, and
waited."Monsignor," continued the now thoroughly heated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles,
"why do not the women of your Church constitute our society leaders?Why do you not recognize the desirability of forcing your people into
every avenue of human activity?And would you resent a suggestion from
me as to how in one instance this might be accomplished?""Certainly not, Madam," replied Monsignor, with an expression of
wonder on his face."You are laughing at me, I do believe!"she exclaimed, catching the
glint in his gray eyes."Pardon me, dear lady, I really am deeply interested."Well, at any rate I have your promise to forget this conversation if
you do not approve of it," she said quizzically.He nodded his head to inspire her confidence; and she continued:

"Very well, now to the point.My ward, the little Inca princess, is
coming out shortly.I want her to have the _entree_ into the very best
society, into the most fashionable and exclusive set, as befitting her
rank."She stopped and awaited the effect of her words.Monsignor studied her for a moment, and then broke into a genial
laugh."There is nothing reprehensible in your wish, Madam," he said."Our social system, however imperfect, nevertheless exists,
and--dominant Catholic influence might improve it."Why, I really see nothing that I can do," he replied slowly.Hawley-Crowles was becoming exasperated with his apparent
dullness."You can do much," she retorted in a tone tinctured with
impatience."Since I have made you my Father Confessor to-day, I am
going to tell you that I intend to start a social war that will rip
this city wide open.It is going to be war in which Catholic is pitted
against Protestant.For a moment her blunt question startled him, and he stared at her
uncomprehendingly; but he quickly recovered his poise and
