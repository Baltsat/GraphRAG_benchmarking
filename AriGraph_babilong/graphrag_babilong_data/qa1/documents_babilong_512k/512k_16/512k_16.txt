For my part, sing, but a sensible sailor expecting to marry ought
to appreciate it when his employer is looking out for his good.You
young fellows have no respect for grey hairs.for grey hairs that
have become grey in want and misery----

BOS.Your mother's seen me, as child,
standing before the bait trays.I also have stood in an East wind
that froze your ears, biting off bait heads----

GEERT.We don't care for your stories, Meneer.You have
become a rich man, and a tyrant.Good!--you are perhaps no worse than
the rest, but don't interfere with me in my own house.We may all become different, and perhaps my son may
live to see the day when he will come, as I did, twelve years ago,
crying to the office, to ask if there's any news of his father and
his two brothers!and not find their employer sitting by his warm fire
and his strong box, drinking grog.He may not be damned for coming so
often to ask the same thing, nor be turned from the door with snubs
and the message, "When there's anything to tell you'll hear of it."You lie--I never did anything of the sort.I won't soil any more words over it.My father's hair was grey, my mother's hair is grey, Jelle,
the poor devil who can't find a place in the Old Men's Home because
on one occasion in his life he was light-fingered--Jelle has also
grey hairs.If you hear him or crooked
Jacob, it's the same cuckoo song.But
now I'll give another word of advice, my friend, before you go under
sail.You have an old mother, you expect to marry, good; you've been
in prison six months--I won't talk of that; you have barked out your
insolence to me in your own house, but if you attempt any of this
talk on board the Hope you'll find out there is a muster roll.When you've become older--and wiser--you'll be ashamed of your
insolence--"the ship owner by his warm stove, and his grog"----

GEERT.And his strong box----

BOS.And his cares, you haven't the wits to understand!Who hauls the fish out of the sea?Who
risks his life every hour of the day?Who doesn't take off his
clothes in five or six weeks?Who walks with hands covered with salt
sores,--without water to wash face or hands?Who sleep like beasts
two in a bunk?Who leave wives and mothers behind to beg alms?Twelve
head of us are presently going to sea--we get twenty-five per cent
of the catch, you seventy-five.We do the work, you sit safely at
home.Your ship is insured, and we--we can go to the bottom in case
of accident--we are not worth insuring----

KNEIR.You should be a clown in a
circus!Twenty-seven per cent isn't enough for him----

GEERT.I'll never eat salted codfish from your generosity!Our whole
share is in "profit and loss."When luck is with us we each make eight
guilders a week, one guilder a day when we're lucky.One guilder a
day at sea, to prepare salt fish, cod with livers for the people in
the cities--hahaha!--a guilder a day--when you're lucky and don't go
to the bottom.You fellows know what you're about when you engage us
on shares.[Old and young heads of fishermen appear at the window.]And say to the skipper--no, never mind--I'll
be there myself----[A pause.]Now I'll
take two minutes more, blockhead, to rub under your nose something
I tried three times to say, but you gave me no chance to get in a
word.When you lie in your bunk tonight--as a beast, of course!--try
and think of my risks, by a poor catch--lost nets and cordage--by
damages and lightning in the mast, by running aground, and God knows
what else.The Jacoba's just had her hatches torn off, the Queen
Wilhelmina half her bulwarks washed away.You don't count that,
for you don't have to pay for it!Three months ago the Expectation
collided with a steamer.Without a thought of the catch or the nets,
the men sprang overboard, leaving the ship to drift!You laugh, boy, because you don't realize what cares I
have.On the Mathilde last week the men smuggled gin and tobacco in
their mattresses to sell to the English.If you were talking about conditions in Middelharnis or Pernis,
you'd have reason for it.My men don't pay the harbor costs, don't
pay for bait, towing, provisions, barrels, salt.I don't expect you
to pay the loss of the cordage, if a gaff or a boom breaks.I go into
my own pocket for it.I gave your mother an advance, your brother
Barend deserts.No, Meneer, I can't believe that.Hengst telephoned me from the harbor, else I wouldn't have
been here to be insulted by your oldest son, who's disturbing the
whole neighborhood roaring his scandalous songs!If you're not on board on time I'll apply "Article
Sixteen" and fine you twenty-five guilders.As for you, my wife doesn't need you at
present, you're all a bad lot here.Ach, Meneer, it isn't my fault!After this voyage you can look for
another employer, who enjoys throwing pearls before swine better than
I do!Don't hang your head so soon, Aunt!Geert was in the right----

KNEIR.Great God, if he should desert--if he
deserts--he also goes to prison--two sons who----

GEERT.Aren't you going to wish me a good voyage--or don't you think
that necessary?Yes, I'm coming----

JO.I'm sorry for her, the poor thing.You gave him a
talking to, didn't you?[Picks a geranium from a flower
pot.]And you will
think of me every night, will you?Truus saw him hanging around the house.If that coward refuses to go,
your sitting at home won't help a damn.Don't forget your chewing tobacco
and your cigars----

GEERT.If you're too late--I'll never look at you again!I'll shout the whole village together if you don't
immediately run and follow Geert and Jo.If you can keep Geert from going--call him back!Have you gone crazy with fear, you big coward?The Good Hope is no good, no good--her ribs are
rotten--the planking is rotten!----

KNEIR.Don't stand there telling stories to excuse yourself.Simon, the ship carpenter--that drunken sot who can't speak
two words.First you sign, then you
run away!Me--you may beat me to death!--but I won't go on an unseaworthy
ship!Hasn't the ship been lying in the
dry docks?There was no caulking her any more--Simon----

KNEIR.March, take your package of
chewing tobacco.I'm not going--I'm not going.You don't know--you
didn't see it!The last voyage she had a foot of water in her hold!A ship that has just returned from her fourth
voyage to the herring catch and that has brought fourteen loads!Has
it suddenly become unseaworthy, because you, you miserable coward,
are going along?I looked in the hold--the barrels were
floating.You can see death that is hiding down there.Bilge water, as in every ship!Tell that
to your grandmother, not to an old sailor's wife.Skipper Hengst
is a child, eh!Isn't Hengst going and Mees and Gerrit and Jacob
and Nellis--your own brother and Truus' little Peter?Do you claim
to know more than old seamen?I'm not going to
stand it to see you taken aboard by the police----

BAR.Oh, Mother dear, Mother dear, don't make me go!Oh, God; how you have punished me in my children--my children
are driving me to beggary.I've taken an advance--Bos has refused to
give me any more cleaning to do--and--and----[Firmly.]Well, then,
let them come for you--you'd better be taken than run away.Oh, oh,
that this should happen in my family----

BAR.You'll not get out----

BAR.I don't know what I'm doing--I might hurt----

KNEIR.Now he is brave, against his sixty year old mother----Raise
your hand if you dare![Falls on a chair shaking his head between his hands.]Oh, oh,
oh--If they take me aboard, you'll never see me again--you'll never
see Geert again----

KNEIR.It's tempting God to rave this
way with fear----[Friendlier tone.]Come, a man of your age must
not cry like a child--come!I wanted to surprise you with Father's
earrings--come!Mother dear--I don't dare--I don't dare--I shall drown--hide
me--hide me----

KNEIR.If I believed a word of your talk,
would I let Geert go?There's a
package of tobacco, and one of cigars.Now sit still, and I'll put
in your earrings--look--[Talking as to a child.]--real silver--ships
on them with sails--sit still, now--there's one--there's two--walk
to the looking glass----

BAR.No--no!----

KNEIR.Come now, you're making me weak for nothing--please,
dear boy--I do love you and your brother--you're all I have on
earth.Every night I will pray to the good God to bring you
home safely.You must get used to it, then you will become a brave
seaman--and--and----[Cries.][Holds the
mirror before him.]Look at your earrings--what?----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Coming in through door at left, good-natured
manner.]Skipper Hengst has requested the Police----If you please,
my little man, we have no time to lose.The ship--is rotten----

2ND POLICEMAN.Then you should not have
mustered in.[Taps him kindly
on the shoulder.][Clings desperately to the
bedstead and door jamb.]I shall
drown in the dirty, stinking sea!Oh God, Oh
God, Oh God![Crawls up against the wall, beside himself with terror.]The boy is afraid----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Sobbing as she seizes Barend's hands.]Come now, boy--come
now--God will not forsake you----

BAR.[Moaning as he loosens his hold, sobs despairingly.]You'll
never see me again, never again----

1ST POLICEMAN.[They exeunt, dragging Barend.]Oh, oh----

TRUUS.What was the matter,
Kneir?Barend had to be taken by the police.Oh, and now
I'm ashamed to go walk through the village, to tell them good bye--the
disgrace--the disgrace----

                                CURTAIN.A lighted lamp--the illuminated
chimney gives a red glow.Kneirtje lying on bed, dressed, Jo reading
to her from prayerbook.]in piteousness,
      To your poor children of the sea,
    Reach down your arms in their distress;
      With God their intercessor be.Unto the Heart Divine your prayer
    Will make an end to all their care."[A
knock--she tiptoes to cook-shed door, puts her finger to her lips in
warning to Clementine and Kaps, who enter.]She's not herself yet,
feverish and coughing.I've brought her a plate of soup, and a half dozen
eggs.I've brought you some veal soup, Kneir.I'd like to see you carry a full pan with the sand blowing in
your eyes.There's five--and--[Looking at his hand, which drips with egg
yolk.][Bringing out his handkerchief and purse covered with egg.]He calls that putting them away
carefully.My purse, my handkerchief, my cork screw.I don't know why Father keeps that bookkeeper, deaf,
and cross.They haven't
forgotten the row with your sons yet.Mouth shut, or I'll get a
scolding.May Jo go to the beach with me to look at the sea?Go on the beach in such a
storm!I got a tap aft that struck the spot.The tree beside the pig stye was broken in two like a pipe stem.Did it come down on the pig stye?Uncle Cobus,
how do you come to be out, after eight o'clock, in this beastly
weather?The beans and pork gravy he ate----

CLEMENTINE.Beans and pork gravy for a sick old man?The matron broils him a chicken or a beefsteak--Eh?She's
even cross because she's got to beat an egg for his breakfast.This
afternoon he was delirious, talking of setting out the nets, and paying
out the buoy line.I sez to the matron, "His time's come.""Look out or
yours'll come," sez she.I sez, "The doctor should be sent for.""Mind
your own business," sez she, "am I the Matron or are you?"Then I
sez, "You're the matron."Just now, she sez,
"You'd better go for the doctor."As if it couldn't a been done this
afternoon.I go to the doctor and the doctor's out of town.Now I've
been to Simon to take me to town in his dog car.If drunken Simon drives, you're likely to roll off
the <DW18>.Must the doctor ride in the dog
car?Go on, now, tell us the rest.What I want to say is, that it's a blessing for Daantje he's
out of his head, 'fraid as he's always been of death.That's all in the way you look at it.If my time
should come tomorrow, then, I think, we must all!The waters of the sea
will not wash away that fact.On the fifth
day He created the Sea, great whales and the moving creatures that
abound therein, and said: "Be fruitful," and He blessed them.That
was evening and that was morning, that was the fifth day.And on the
sixth day He created man and said also: "Be fruitful," and blessed
them.That was again evening and again morning, that was the sixth
day.When I was on the herring
catch, or on the salting voyage, there were times when I didn't dare
use the cleaning knife.Because when you shove a herring's head
to the left with your thumb, and you lift out the gullet with the
blade, the creature looks at you with such knowing eyes, and yet
you clean two hundred in an hour.And when you cut throats out of
fourteen hundred cod, that makes twenty-eight hundred eyes that look
at you!I had few
equals in boning and cutting livers.Tja, tja, and how afraid they all
were!They looked up at the clouds as if they were saying:
"How about this now.I say:
we take the fish and God takes us.We must all, the beasts must,
and the men must, and because we all must, none of us should--now,
that's just as if you'd pour a full barrel into an empty one.I'd
be afraid to be left alone in the empty barrel, with every one else
in the other barrel.No, being afraid is no good; being afraid is
standing on your toes and looking over the edge.You act as if you'd had
a dram.Am I right about the pig
stye or not?Hear how the poor animal is going on out there.I'm sure
the wall has fallen in.You pour yourself out a bowl, Uncle Cobus!I'll give her a
helping hand.Cobus, I'll thank God when the Good Hope is safely in.But the Hope is an old ship,
and old ships are the last to go down.No, that's what every old sailor says.All the same, I shall pray
God tonight.But the Jacoba is out and the
Mathilda is out and the Expectation is out.The Good Hope is rotten--so--so----[Stops anxiously.]That's what----Why--that's what----I thought----It just
occurred to me.If the Good Hope was rotten, then your father would----

CLEMENTINE.Oh, shut your fool mouth, you'll make Kneir anxious.Quick,
Kneir, shut the door, for the lamp.How scared Barend will be, and just as
they're homeward bound.The evening is still so long and
so gloomy--Yes?[Enter Simon and Marietje, who is crying.]Stop your damn
howling----

KNEIRTJE.Her lover is also--be a good seaman's
wife.You girls haven't had any trouble
yet!If it wasn't for Daan----

JO.Here, this will warm you up, Simon.It's happened to me before
with the dog car, in a tempest like this.And when the
doctor came, Katrien was dead and the child was dead, but if you ask
me, I'd rather sit in my dog car tonight than to be on the sea.No, don't let us waste our time.Let's talk, then we won't
think of anything.Last night was stormy, too, and I had such a bad dream.I can't rightly say it was a dream.There was a rap on the
window, once.Soon as I lay down there came another rap, so.[Raps on
the table with her knuckles.]And then I saw Mees, his face was pale,
pale as--God!Each time--like that, so----[Raps.]You stupid, you, to scare the old woman into a fit with your
raps.My ears and neck full of sand, and it's
cold.Just throw a couple of blocks on the fire.I couldn't stand it at home either, children asleep, no one
to talk to, and the howling of the wind.Two mooring posts were
washed away.What's that to us----Milk and sugar?Your little son was a brave boy, Truus.I can see him
now as he stood waving good-bye.Yes, that boy's a treasure, barely twelve.You
should have seen him two and a half months ago.The child behaved like an angel, just like a grown
man.He would sit up evenings to chat with me, the child knows more
than I do.The lamb, hope he's not been awfully sea sick.Now, you may not believe it, but red spectacles
keep you from being sea sick.You're like the doctors, they let others swallow their doses.Many's the night I've slept on board; when my husband was
alive I went along on many a voyage.Should like to have seen you in oil skins.Hear, now, the young lady is flattering me.I'm not so bad
looking as that, Miss.Now and then, when things
didn't go to suit him, without speaking ill of the dead, I may say,
he couldn't keep his paws at home; then he'd smash things.I still
have a coffee pot without a handle I keep as a remembrance.--I wouldn't
part with it for a rix dollar.I won't even offer you a guilder!Say, you're such a funny story teller, tell us about the Harlemmer
oil, Saart.Yes, if it hadn't been for Harlemmer oil I might not have been
a widow.Now, then, my man was a comical chap.I'd bought him a knife in a leather sheath, paid a good price
for it too, and when he'd come back in five weeks and I'd ask him:
"Jacob, have you lost your knife?"he'd say, "I don't know about my
knife--you never gave me a knife."But
when he'd undress himself for the first time in five weeks, and pulled
off his rubber boots, bang, the knife would fall on the floor.He
hadn't felt it in all that time.Didn't take off his rubber boots in five weeks?Then I had to scrub 'im with soap and soda; he hadn't seen
water, and covered with vermin.Wish I could get a cent a dozen for all the lice on board;
they get them thrown in with their share of the cargo.Now
then, his last voyage a sheet of water threw him against the bulwarks
just as they pulled the mizzen staysail to larboard, and his leg was
broke.Then they were in a fix--The skipper could poultice and cut a
corn, but he couldn't mend a broken leg.Then they wanted to shove a
plank under it, but Jacob wanted Harlemmer oil rubbed on his leg.Every
day he had them rub it with Harlemmer oil, and again Harlemmer oil,
and some more Harlemmer oil.When they came in
his leg was a sight.You shouldn't have asked me to tell it.Now, yes; you can't bring the dead back to life.And when you
think of it, it's a dirty shame I can't marry again.A year later
the Changeable went down with man and mouse.Then, bless me, you'd
suppose, as your husband was dead, for he'd gone along with his leg
and a half, you could marry another man.First you must
advertise for him in the newspapers three times, and then if in three
times he don't turn up, you may go and get a new license.I don't think I'll ever marry again.That's not surprisin' when you've been married twice already;
if you don't know the men by this time.I wish I could talk about things the way you do.With my first it was a horror; with my second you know
yourselves.I could sit up all night hearing tales of
the sea.Don't tell stories of suffering and death----

SAART.[Quietly knitting and speaking in a toneless voice.]Ach,
it couldn't have happened here, Kneir.We lived in Vlaardingen then,
and I'd been married a year without any children.No, Pietje was Ari's
child--and he went away on the Magnet.And you understand what happened;
else I wouldn't have got acquainted with Ari and be living next door
to you now.The Magnet stayed on the sands or some other place.But
I didn't know that then, and so didn't think of it.Now in Vlaardingen they have a tower and on the tower a lookout.And this lookout hoists a red ball when he sees a lugger or
a trawler or other boat in the distance.And when he sees who it
is, he lets down the ball, runs to the ship owner and the families
to warn them; that's to say: the Albert Koster or the Good Hope is
coming.Now mostly he's no need to warn the family.For, as soon as
the ball is hoisted in the tower, the children run in the streets
shouting, I did it, too, as a child: "The ball is up!Then the women run, and wait below for the lookout to come down,
and when it's their ship they give him pennies.And--and--the Magnet with my first
husband, didn't I say I'd been married a year?The Magnet stayed out
seven weeks--with provisions for six--and each time the children
shouted: "The ball is up, Truus!Then I
ran like mad to the tower.They all knew why
I ran, and when the lookout came down I could have torn the words
out of his mouth.But I would say: "Have you tidings--tidings of
the Magnet?"Then he'd say: "No, it's the Maria," or the Alert,
or the Concordia, and then I'd drag myself away slowly, so slowly,
crying and thinking of my husband.And each day, when
the children shouted, I got a shock through my brain, and each day I
stood by the tower, praying that God--but the Magnet did not come--did
not come.At the last I didn't dare to go to the tower any more when
the ball was hoisted.No longer dared to stand at the door waiting,
if perhaps the lookout himself would bring the message.That lasted
two months--two months--and then--well, then I believed it.Now, that's so short a time since.Ach, child, I'd love to talk about it to every
one, all day long.When you've been left with six children--a good
man--never gave me a harsh word--never.Had it happened six
days later they would have brought him in.They smell when there's
a corpse aboard.Yes, that's true, you never see them otherwise.You'll never marry a fisherman, Miss; but it's sad,
sad; God, so sad!when they lash your dear one to a plank, wrapped in
a piece of sail with a stone in it, three times around the big mast,
and then, one, two, three, in God's name.No, I wasn't thinking of Mees, I was thinking of my little
brother, who was also drowned.Wasn't that on the herring catch?His second voyage, a blow
from the fore sail, and he lay overboard.The
skipper reached him the herring shovel, but it was smooth and it
slipped from his hands.Then Jerusalem, the mate, held out the broom
to him--again he grabbed hold.The three of them pulled him up; then
the broom gave way, he fell back into the waves, and for the third
time the skipper threw him a line.God wanted my little brother, the
line broke, and the end went down with him to the bottom of the sea.frightful!--Grabbed it three times, and lost
it three times.As if the child knew what was coming in the morning, he had
lain crying all night.Crying for Mother, who was
sick.When the skipper tried to console him, he said: "No, skipper,
even if Mother does get well, I eat my last herring today."No, truly, Miss, when he came back from Pieterse's with the
money, Toontje's share of the cargo as rope caster, eighteen guilders
and thirty-five cents for five and a half weeks.Then he simply acted
insane, he threw the money on the ground, then he cursed at--I won't
repeat what--at everything.Mother's sickness and burial
had cost a lot.Eighteen guilders is a heap of money, a big heap.Eighteen guilders for your child, eighteen--[Listening in alarm
to the blasts of the wind.]No, say, Hahaha!----

KNEIRTJE.Yes, yes, if the water could
only speak.Come now, you tell a tale of the sea.Ach, Miss, life on the sea is no tale.Nothing
between yourself and eternity but the thickness of a one-inch
plank.It's hard on the men, and hard on the women.Yesterday I passed
by the garden of the Burgomaster.They sat at table and ate cod from
which the steam was rising, and the children sat with folded hands
saying grace.Then, thought I, in my ignorance--if it was wrong, may
God forgive me--that it wasn't right of the Burgomaster--not right
of him--and not right of the others.For the wind blew so hard out
of the East, and those fish came out of the same water in which our
dead--how shall I say it?--in which our dead--you understand me.It is our living,
and we must not rebel against our living.When the lead was dropped he could tell by the taste of the
sand where they were.Often in the night he'd say we are on the 56th
and on the 56th they'd be.Once
he drifted about two days and nights in a boat with two others.That
was the time they were taking in the net and a fog came up so thick
they couldn't see the buoys, let alone find the lugger.Later when the boat went to pieces--you should
have heard him tell it--how he and old Dirk swam to an overturned
rowboat; he climbed on top."I'll never forget that night," said
he.Dirk was too old or tired to get a hold.Then my husband stuck
his knife into the boat.Dirk tried to grasp it as he was sinking,
and he clutched in such a way that three of his fingers hung
down.Then at the risk of his own life,
my husband pulled Dirk up onto the overturned boat.So the two of
them drifted in the night, and Dirk--old Dirk--from loss of blood
or from fear, went insane.He sat and glared at my husband with the
eyes of a cat.He raved of the devil that was in him.Of Satan, and
the blood, my husband said, ran all over the boat--the waves were
kept busy washing it away.Just at dawn Dirk slipped off, insane
as he was.My man was picked up by a freighter that sailed by.But
it was no use, three years later--that's twelve years ago now--the
Clementine--named after you by your father--stranded on the Doggerbanks
with him and my two oldest.Of what happened to them, I know nothing,
nothing at all.Never a buoy, or a hatch, washed ashore.You can't realize it at first, but after so many years one
can't recall their faces any more, and that's a blessing.For hard it
would be if one remembered.Every sailor's
wife has something like this in her family, it's not new.Truus is
right: "The fish are dearly paid for."We are all in God's hands, and God is great and good.[Beating her
head with her fists.]You're all driving me mad, mad, mad!Her husband and her little brother--and my poor
uncle--those horrible stories--instead of cheering us up!My father was drowned, drowned, drowned,
drowned!There are others--all--drowned, drowned!--and--you are all
miserable wretches--you are![Violently bangs the door shut as she
runs out.]No, child, she will quiet down by herself.Nervous strain
of the last two days.It has grown late, Kneir, and your niece--your niece was a
little unmannerly.Thank you again, Miss, for the soup and eggs.Are you coming to drink a bowl with me tomorrow night?If you see Jo send her in at once.[All go out except
Kneirtje.A fierce wind howls, shrieking
about the house.She listens anxiously at the window, shoves her
chair close to the chimney, stares into the fire.Her lips move in
a muttered prayer while she fingers a rosary.Jo enters, drops into
a chair by the window and nervously unpins her shawl.]And that dear child that came out in the storm to bring me
soup and eggs.Your sons are out in the storm for her and her father.Half the guard
rail is washed away, the pier is under water.You never went on like this
when Geert sailed with the Navy.In a month or two
it will storm again; each time again.And there are many fishermen on
the sea besides our boys.[Her speech sinks into a soft murmur.Her
old fingers handle the rosary.]Barend, we almost drove him away![Seeing that Kneirtje prays, she walks to the window wringing
her hands, pulls up the curtain uncertainly, stares through the window
panes.The wind blows the
curtain on high, the lamp dances, the light puffs out.oh!----

KNEIRTJE.[Jo
lights the lamp, shivering with fear.][To Jo,
who crouches sobbing by the chimney.]If anything happens--then--then----

KNEIRTJE.Now, I ask you, how will it be when you're married?You don't know
what you say, Aunt Kneir!If Geert--[Stops, panting.]That was not
good of you--not good--to have secrets.Your lover--your husband--is
my son.Don't stare that way into the
fire.Even if
it was wrong of you and of him.Come and sit opposite to me, then
together we will--[Lays her prayerbook on the table.]If anything happens----

KNEIRTJE.If anything--anything--anything--then I'll never pray
again, never again.No Mother Mary--then there
is nothing--nothing----

KNEIRTJE.[Opens the prayerbook, touches Jo's arm.Jo looks up, sobbing
passionately, sees the prayerbook, shakes her head fiercely.Again
wailing, drops to the floor, which she beats with her hands.Kneirtje's
trembling voice sounds.][The wind races with wild lashings about the house.]Left, office door, separated from the
main office by a wooden railing.Between this door and railing are
two benches; an old cupboard.In the background; three windows with
view of the sunlit sea.In front of the middle window a standing
desk and high stool.Right, writing table with telephone--a safe,
an inside door.On the walls, notices of wreckage, insurance, maps,
etc.[Kaps, Bos and Mathilde discovered.]Clemens!----

KAPS.: 2,447 ribs, marked Kusta; ten sail sheets, marked 'M."Four deck beams, two spars, five"----

MATHILDE.I have written the circular for the tower
bell.Connect me with the
Burgomaster!Up to my ears
in--[Sweetly.]My little wife asks----

MATHILDE.If Mevrouw will come to the telephone about the circular.If Mevrouw
will come to the telephone a moment?Just so, Burgomaster,--the
ladies--hahaha!Then it can go to the
printers.Do you think I
haven't anything on my mind!That damned----

MATHILDE.No,
she can't come to the telephone herself, she doesn't know
how.My wife has written the circular for
the tower bell."You are no doubt acquainted with the new church."--She
says, "No," the stupid!I am reading, Mevrouw, again."You are no
doubt acquainted with the new church.The church has, as you know,
a high tower; that high tower points upward, and that is good, that is
fortunate, and truly necessary for many children of our generation"----

MATHILDE.Pardon, I was speaking to
my bookkeeper.Yes--yes--ha, ha, ha--[Reads again
from paper.]"But that tower could do something else that also is
good.It can mark the time for us children of the
times.It stands there since 1882 and has never
answered to the question, 'What time is it?'It
was indeed built for it, there are four places visible for faces;
for years in all sorts of ways"--Did you say anything?No?--"for years
the wish has been expressed by the surrounding inhabitants that they
might have a clock--About three hundred guilders are needed.The Committee, Mevrouw"--What did you say?Yes, you know the
names, of course.Yes--Yes--All the ladies of
the Committee naturally sign for the same amount, a hundred guilders
each?Yes--Yes--Very well--My wife will be at home, Mevrouw.Damned nonsense!--a hundred guilders gone to the devil!What
is it to you if there's a clock on the damn thing or not?I'll let you fry in your own fat.She'll be here in her carriage in quarter of an hour.If you drank less grog in the evenings
you wouldn't have such a bad temper in the mornings.You took five guilders out of my purse this morning
while I was asleep.I can keep no----

MATHILDE.Bah, what a man, who counts his money before he goes to bed!Very well, don't give it--Then I can treat the Burgomaster's
wife to a glass of gin presently--three jugs of old gin and not a
single bottle of port or sherry![Bos angrily throws down two rix
dollars.]If it wasn't for me you wouldn't
be throwing rix dollars around!--Bah!IJmuiden, 24 December--Today there were four sloops
in the market with 500 to 800 live and 1,500 to 2,100 dead haddock
and some--live cod--The live cod brought 7 1/4--the dead----

BOS.The dead haddock brought thirteen and a half guilders a basket.Take
your book--turn to the credit page of the Expectation----

KAPS.no--the Good Hope?--We can whistle for her.Fourteen hundred and forty-three guilders and forty-seven cents.How could you be so ungodly stupid, to deduct four
guilders, 88, for the widows and orphans' fund?--1,443--3 per cent off--that's
1,400--that's gross three hundred and 87 guilders--yes, it should be
three guilders, 88, instead of four, 88.If you're going into your dotage, Jackass!There might be something to say against
that, Meneer--you didn't go after me when, when----

BOS.Now, that'll do, that'll do!----

KAPS.And that was an error with a couple of big ciphers after it.[Bos
goes off impatiently at right.]It all depends on what side----

[Looks around, sees Bos is gone, pokes up the fire; fills his pipe from
Bos's tobacco jar, carefully steals a couple of cigars from his box.]Mynheer Bos, eh?--no.Meneer said
that when he got news, he----

SIMON.The Jacoba came in after fifty-nine days' lost time.You are--You know more than you let on.Then it's time--I know more, eh?I'm holding off the ships by
ropes, eh?I warned you folks when that ship lay in the docks.What were
the words I spoke then, eh?All tales on your part for a glass
of gin!You was there, and the Miss was there.I says,
"The ship is rotten, that caulking was damn useless.That a floating
coffin like that"----

KAPS.Are
you so clever that when you're half drunk----

SIMON.Not drunk then, are you such an authority, you a shipmaster's
assistant, that when you say "no," and the owner and the Insurance
Company say "yes," my employer must put his ship in the dry docks?And now, I say--now, I say--that
if Mees, my daughter's betrothed, not to speak of the others, if
Mees--there will be murder.I'll be back in ten
minutes.[Goes back to his desk; the telephone rings.Mynheer
will be back in ten minutes.Mynheer Bos just went round the
corner.How lucky that outside of the children there were three
unmarried men on board.Or you'll break Meneer's
cigars.Kaps, do you want to make a guilder?I'm engaged to Bol, the skipper.He's lying here, with a load of peat for the city.I can't; because they don't know if my husband's dead.The legal limit is----

SAART.You must summons him, 'pro Deo,' three times in the papers and
if he doesn't come then, and that he'll not do, for there aren't any
more ghosts in the world, then you can----

SAART.Now, if you'd attend to this little matter, Bol and I would
always be grateful to you.When your common sense tells you
I haven't seen Jacob in three years and the----

[Cobus enters, trembling with agitation.]There must be tidings of the boys--of--of--the
Hope.Now, there is no use in your coming
to this office day after day.I haven't any good news to give you,
the bad you already know.Sixty-two days----

COB.Ach, ach, ach; Meneer Kaps,
help us out of this uncertainty.My sister--and my niece--are simply
insane with grief.My niece is sitting alone at home--my sister is at the Priest's,
cleaning house.There must be something--there must be something.The water bailiff's clerk said--said--Ach, dear God----[Off.]after that storm--all things
are possible.No, I wouldn't give a cent for it.If they had run into an English harbor, we would have
had tidings.[Laying her sketch book on Kaps's desk.]That's the way he was three months ago,
hale and jolly.No, Miss, I haven't the time.Daantje's death was a blow to him--you always saw them together,
always discussing.Now he hasn't a friend in the "Home"; that makes
a big difference.Well, that's Kneir, that's Barend with the basket on his back,
and that's--[The telephone bell rings.How long
will he be, Kaps?A hatch marked
47--and--[Trembling.][Screams and lets the
receiver fall.]I don't dare listen--Oh, oh!Barend?----Barend?----

CLEMENTINE.A telegram from Nieuwediep.A hatch--and a corpse----

[Enter Bos.]The water bailiff is on the 'phone.The water bailiff?--Step aside--Go along, you!I--I--[Goes timidly off.]A
telegram from Nieuwediep?47?--Well,
that's damned--miserable--that!the corpse--advanced stage of
decomposition!Barend--mustered in as oldest boy!by--oh!--The Expectation has come into Nieuwediep disabled?And
did Skipper Maatsuiker recognize him?So it isn't necessary to send any
one from here for the identification?Yes, damned sad--yes--yes--we
are in God's hand--Yes--yes--I no longer had any doubts--thank
you--yes--I'd like to get the official report as soon as possible.I
will inform the underwriters, bejour!I
never expected to hear of the ship again.Yes--yes--yes--yes--[To Clementine.]What stupidity to repeat what you heard in that woman's
presence.It won't be five minutes now till half the village is
here!You sit there, God save me, and take
on as if your lover was aboard----

CLEMENTINE.When Simon, the shipbuilder's assistant----

BOS.And if he hadn't been, what right have you to stick
your nose into matters you don't understand?Dear God, now I am also guilty----

BOS.Have the novels you read gone to
your head?Are you possessed, to use those words after such
an accident?He said that the ship was a floating coffin.Then I heard
you say that in any case it would be the last voyage for the Hope.That damned boarding school; those damned
boarding school fads!Walk if you like through the village like a fool,
sketching the first rascal or beggar you meet!But don't blab out
things you can be held to account for.Say, rather,
a drunken authority--The North, of Pieterse, and the Surprise and the
Willem III and the Young John.Half of the
fishing fleet and half the merchant fleet are floating coffins.No, Meneer, I don't hear anything.If you had asked me: "Father, how is this?"But you conceited young people meddle with everything and
more, too!What stronger proof is there than the yearly inspection of
the ships by the underwriters?Do you suppose that when I presently
ring up the underwriter and say to him, "Meneer, you can plank down
fourteen hundred guilders"--that he does that on loose grounds?You
ought to have a face as red as a buoy in shame for the way you flapped
out your nonsense!Nonsense; that might take away
my good name, if I wasn't so well known.If I were a ship owner--and I heard----

BOS.God preserve the fishery from an owner who makes drawings and
cries over pretty vases!I stand as a father at the head of a hundred
homes.When you get sensitive you go head over
heels.[Kaps makes a motion that he cannot hear.]The Burgomaster's wife is making a call.Willem Hengst, aged
thirty-seven, married, four children----

BOS.Wait a moment till my daughter----

CLEMENTINE.Jacob Zwart, aged thirty-five years, married,
three children.Gerrit Plas, aged twenty-five years, married, one
child.Geert Vermeer, unmarried, aged twenty-six years.Nellis Boom,
aged thirty-five years, married, seven children.Klaas Steen, aged
twenty-four years, married.Solomon Bergen, aged twenty-five years,
married, one child.Mari Stad, aged forty-five years, married.Barend Vermeer,
aged nineteen years.Pietje Stappers, aged twelve years.Ach, God; don't make me unhappy, Meneer!----

BOS.Stappers----

MARIETJE.You lie!--It isn't
possible!----

BOS.The Burgomaster at Nieuwediep has telegraphed the water
bailiff.Barend Vermeer was washed ashore.You know what that means,
and a hatch of the 47----

TRUUS.Oh, Mother Mary, must I lose that child, too?Oh,
oh, oh, oh!--Pietje--Pietje----

MARIETJE.Then--Then--[Bursts into a hysterical
laugh.]Hahaha!--Hahaha!----

BOS.[Striking the glass from Clementine's hand.][Falling on her knees, her hands catching hold of the railing
gate.]Let me die!--Let me die, please, dear God, dear God!Come Marietje, be calm; get up.And so brave; as he stood there, waving,
when the ship--[Sobs loudly.]There hasn't
been a storm like that in years.Think of Hengst with four children,
and Jacob and Gerrit--And, although it's no consolation, I will hand
you your boy's wages today, if you like.Both of you go home now and
resign yourselves to the inevitable--take her with you--she seems----

MARIETJE.I want to
die, die----

CLEMENTINE.Cry, Marietje, cry, poor lamb----

[They go off.]Are
you too lazy to put pen to paper today?Have you
the Widows' and Orphans' fund at hand?[Bos
throws him the keys.][Opens the safe, shuffles back
to Bos's desk with the book.]Ninety-five widows, fourteen old sailors and fishermen.Yes, the fund fell short some time ago.We will have to put in
another appeal.The Burgomaster's
wife asks if you will come in for a moment.Kaps, here is the copy for the circular.Talk to her about making a public appeal for the unfortunates.Yes, but, Clemens, isn't that overdoing it, two begging
parties?I will do it myself, then--[Both exit.][Goes to his desk
and sits down opposite to him.]I feel so miserable----

KAPS.The statement of
Veritas for October--October alone; lost, 105 sailing vessels and
30 steamships--that's a low estimate; fifteen hundred dead in one
month.Yes, when you see it as it appears
today, so smooth, with the floating gulls, you wouldn't believe that
it murders so many people.[To Jo and Cobus, who sit alone in a dazed way.]We have just run from home--for Saart just as I
said--just as I said----

[Enter Bos.]You stay
where you are, Cobus.You have no doubt heard?----

JO.It happens so often that
they get off in row boats.Not only was there a hatch,
but the corpse was in an extreme state of dissolution.Skipper Maatsuiker of the Expectation identified him, and the
earrings.And if--he should be mistaken----I've
come to ask you for money, Meneer, so I can go to the Helder myself.The Burgomaster of Nieuwediep will take care of that----

[Enter Simon.]I--I--heard----[Makes a strong gesture towards Bos.]I--I--have no evil
intentions----

BOS.Must that drunken
fellow----

SIMON.[Steadying himself by holding to the gate.]No--stay where
you are--I'm going--I--I--only wanted to say how nicely it came
out--with--with--The Good Hope.Don't come so close to me--never come so close to a man with
a knife----No-o-o-o--I have no bad intentions.I only wanted to say,
that I warned you--when--she lay in the docks.Now just for the joke of it--you ask--ask--ask your bookkeeper
and your daughter--who were there----

BOS.You're not worth an answer, you sot!My employer--doesn't do the caulking himself.[To Kaps, who
has advanced to the gate.]Didn't I warn him?--wasn't you there?No, I wasn't there, and even if I
was, I didn't hear anything.Did that drunken sot----

CLEMENTINE.As my daughter do you permit----[Grimly.]I don't remember----

SIMON.That's low--that's low--damned low!I said, the ship was
rotten--rotten----

BOS.You're trying to drag in my bookkeeper
and daughter, and you hear----

COB.Yes, but--yes, but--now I remember also----

BOS.But your daughter--your daughter
says now that she hadn't heard the ship was rotten.And on the second
night of the storm, when she was alone with me at my sister Kneirtje's,
she did say that--that----

CLEMENTINE.Did I--say----

COB.These are my own words
to you: "Now you are fibbing, Miss; for if your father knew the Good
Hope was rotten"----

JO.[Springing up wildly, speaking with piercing distinctness.]I
was there, and Truus was there, and----Oh, you adders!Who
gives you your feed, year in, year out?Haven't you decency enough to
believe us instead of that drunken beggar who reels as he stands there?You had Barend dragged on board by the police; Geert was too
proud to be taken!No,
no, you needn't point to your door!If I staid here
any longer I would spit in your face--spit in your face!For your Aunt's sake I will consider that you
are overwrought; otherwise--otherwise----The Good Hope was seaworthy,
was seaworthy!And even
had the fellow warned me--which is a lie, could I, a business man,
take the word of a drunkard who can no longer get a job because he
is unable to handle tools?I--I told you and him and her--that a floating
coffin like that.Geert and Barend and Mees and the
others![Sinks on the chair
sobbing.]Give me the money to go to Nieuwediep myself, then I won't
speak of it any more.A girl that talks to me as
rudely as you did----

JO.I don't know what I said--and--and--I don't
believe that you--that you--that you would be worse than the devil.The water-bailiff says that it isn't necessary to send any one
to Nieuwediep.What will
become of me now?----

[Cobus and Simon follow her out.]And you--don't you ever dare to set foot again
in my office.Father, I ask myself [Bursts into sobs.]She would be capable of ruining my good name--with
her boarding-school whims.Who ever comes now you send away,
understand?[Sound of Jelle's fiddle
outside.][Falls into his chair, takes
up Clementine's sketch book; spitefully turns the leaves; throws
it on the floor; stoops, jerks out a couple of leaves, tears them
up.Sits in thought a moment, then rings the telephone.]with
Dirksen--Dirksen, I say, the underwriter![Waits, looking
sombre.]It's all up with the
Good Hope.A hatch with my mark washed ashore and the body of a
sailor.I shall wait for you here at my office.[Rings off;
at the last words Kneirtje has entered.]I----[She sinks on the bench, patiently weeping.]Have you mislaid the
policies?You never put a damn thing in its place.The policies are higher, behind
the stocks.[Turning around
with the policies in his hand.]That hussy that
lives with you has been in here kicking up such a scandal that I came
near telephoning for the police.Is it true--is it true
that----The priest said----[Bos nods with a sombre expression.]Oh,
oh----[She stares helplessly, her arms hang limp.]I know you as a respectable woman--and
your husband too.I'm sorry to have to say it to you
now after such a blow, your children and that niece of yours have never
been any good.[Kneirtje's head sinks down.]How many years haven't
we had you around, until your son Geert threatened me with his fists,
mocked my grey hairs, and all but threw me out of your house--and your
other son----[Frightened.]Shall I call Mevrouw or your daughter?with long drawn out sobs,
sits looking before her with a dazed stare.][In an agonized voice, broken with sobs.]And with my own hands I loosened his
fingers from the door post.You have no cause to reproach yourself----

KNEIRTJE.Before he went I hung his
father's rings in his ears.Like--like a lamb to the slaughter----

BOS.Come----

KNEIRTJE.And my oldest boy that I didn't bid good
bye----"If you're too late"--these were his words--"I'll never look
at you again."in God's name, stop!----

KNEIRTJE.Twelve years ago--when the Clementine--I sat here as I am
now.[Sobs with her face between her trembling old hands.]Ach, poor, dear Kneir, I am so sorry for you.My husband and four sons----

MATHILDE.We have written an
appeal, the Burgomaster's wife and I, and it's going to be in all
the papers tomorrow.Here, Kaps----[Hands Kaps a sheet of paper which
he places on desk--Bos motions to her to go.]Let her wait a while,
Clemens.I have a couple of cold chops--that will brace
her up--and--and--let's make up with her.You have no objections
to her coming again to do the cleaning?We won't forget you, do you
hear?Now, my only hope is--my niece's child.She is with child by my
son----[Softly smiling.]No, that isn't a misfortune
now----

BOS.This immorality under your own
roof?Don't you know the rules of the fund, that no aid can be
extended to anyone leading an immoral life, or whose conduct does
not meet with our approval?I leave it to the gentlemen
themselves--to do for me--the gentlemen----

BOS.It will be a tussle with the Committee--the committee of the
fund--your son had been in prison and sang revolutionary songs.And
your niece who----However, I will do my best.I shall recommend
you, but I can't promise anything.There are seven new families,
awaiting aid, sixteen new orphans.My wife wants to give you something to take home
with you.[The bookkeeper rises, disappears
for a moment, and returns with a dish and an enamelled pan.]If you will return the dish when it's convenient,
and if you'll come again Saturday, to do the cleaning.He closes her nerveless hands about the dish and pan;
shuffles back to his stool.Kneirtje sits motionless,
in dazed agony; mumbles--moves her lips--rises with difficulty,
stumbles out of the office.]Appeal, for the
newspapers![Smiling sardonically, he comes to the foreground; leaning
on Bos's desk, he reads.]"Benevolent Fellow Countrymen: Again we
urge upon your generosity an appeal in behalf of a number of destitute
widows and orphans.The lugger Good Hope----[As he continues reading.]End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Good Hope, by Herman Heijermans, Jr.Do not twist your legs,
or arms, or shoulders; for you want to grow into straight and graceful
men and women, instead of being round-shouldered, or hump-backed, or
lame, all your lives.When people are old, their bones contain more lime, and, therefore,
break more easily.You should be kindly helpful to old people, so that they may not fall,
and possibly break their bones.Healthy children are always out-growing their shoes, and sometimes
faster than they wear them out.Tight shoes cause corns and in-growing
nails and other sore places on the feet.All of these are very hard to
get rid of.No one should wear a shoe that pinches or hurts the foot.OUGHT A BOY TO USE TOBACCO?Perhaps some boy will say: "Grown people are always telling us, 'this
will do for men, but it is not good for boys.'"Tobacco is not good for men; but there is a very good reason why it is
worse for boys.If you were going to build a house, would it be wise for you to put into
the stone-work of the cellar something that would make it less strong?Something into the brick-work or the mortar, the wood-work or the nails,
the walls or the chimneys, that would make them weak and tottering,
instead of strong and steady?It would he had enough if you should repair your house with poor
materials; but surely it must be built in the first place with the best
you can get.You will soon learn that boys and girls are building their bodies, day
after day, until at last they reach full size.Afterward, they must be repaired as fast as they wear out.It would be foolish to build any part in a way to make it weaker than
need be.Wise doctors have said that the boy who uses tobacco while he is
growing, makes every part of his body less strong than it otherwise
would be.Boys who smoke can not become such large, fine-looking men as they would
if they did not smoke.Cigarettes are small, but they are very poisonous.Chewing tobacco is a
worse and more filthy habit even than smoking.The frequent spitting it
causes is disgusting to others and hurts the health of the chewer.Tobacco in any form is a great enemy to youth.It stunts the growth,
hurts the mind, and <DW36>s in every way the boy or girl who uses it.Not that it does all this to every youth who smokes, but it is always
true that no boy of seven to fourteen can begin to smoke or chew and
have so fine a body and mind when he is twenty-one years old as he would
have had if he had never used tobacco.If you want to be strong and well
men and women, do not use tobacco in any form.Find as many of each kind as you can.How many bones are there in your whole body?Why could you not use it so well if it were all
          in one piece?What is the use of the little cushions between
          the bones of the spine?What is the difference between the bones of
          children and the bones of old people?What happens if you lean over your desk or
          work?What other bones may be injured by wrong
          positions?What is always true of its use by youth?[Illustration: W]HAT makes the limbs move?You have to take hold of the door to move it back and forth; but you
need not take hold of your arm to move that.Sometimes a door or gate is made to shut itself, if you leave it open.This can be done by means of a wide rubber strap, one end of which is
fastened to the frame of the door near the hinge, and the other end to
the door, out near its edge.When we push open the door, the rubber strap is stretched; but as soon
as we have passed through, the strap tightens, draws the door back, and
shuts it.If you stretch out your right arm, and clasp the upper part tightly with
your left hand, then work the elbow joint strongly back and forth, you
can feel something under your hand draw up, and then lengthen out again,
each time you bend the joint.What you feel, is a muscle (m[)u]s'sl), and it works your joints very
much as the rubber strap works the hinge of the door.One end of the muscle is fastened to the bone just below the elbow
joint; and the other end, higher up above the joint.When it tightens, or contracts, as we say, it bends the joint.When the
arm is straightened, the muscle returns to its first shape.There is another muscle on the outside of the arm which stretches when
this one shortens, and so helps the working of the joint.Every joint has two or more muscles of its own to work it.Think how many there must be in our fingers!If we should undertake to count all the muscles that move our whole
bodies, it would need more counting than some of you could do.You can see muscles on the dinner table; for they are only lean meat.[Illustration: _Tendons of the hand._]

They are fastened to the bones by strong cords, called tendons
(t[)e]n'd[)o]nz).These tendons can be seen in the leg of a chicken or
turkey.They sometimes hold the meat so firmly that it is hard for you
to get it off.When you next try to pick a "drum-stick," remember that
you are eating the strong muscles by which the chicken or turkey moved
his legs as he walked about the yard.The parts that have the most work
to do, need the strongest muscles.Did you ever see the swallows flying about the eaves of a barn?They have very small legs and feet,
because they do not need to walk.The muscles that move the wings are fastened to the breast.These breast
muscles of the swallow must be large and strong.People who work hard with any part of the body make the muscles of that
part very strong.The blacksmith has big, strong muscles in his arms because he uses them
so much.You are using your muscles every day, and this helps them to grow.Once I saw a little girl who had been very sick.She had to lie in bed
for many weeks.Before her sickness she had plenty of stout muscles in
her arms and legs and was running about the house from morning till
night, carrying her big doll in her arms.After her sickness, she could hardly walk ten steps, and would rather
sit and look at her playthings than try to lift them.She had to make
new muscles as fast as possible.Running, coasting, games of ball, and all brisk play and work, help to
make strong muscles.So idleness is an enemy to the muscles.There is another enemy to the muscles about which I must tell you.WHAT ALCOHOL WILL DO TO THE MUSCLES.Fat meat could not work your joints for you as
the muscles do.Alcohol often changes a part of the muscles to fat, and
so takes away a part of their strength.In this way, people often grow
very fleshy from drinking beer, because it contains alcohol, as you will
soon learn.But they can not work any better on account of having this
fat.Where are the muscles in your arms, which help
          you to move your elbows?What do we call the muscles of the lower
          animals?Why do chickens and turkeys need strong muscles
          in their legs?What makes the muscles of the blacksmith's arm
          so strong?[Illustration: H]OW do the muscles know when to move?You have all seen the telegraph wires, by which messages are sent from
one town to another, all over the country.You are too young to understand how this is done, but you each have
something inside of you, by which you are sending messages almost every
minute while you are awake.We will try to learn a little about its wonderful way of working.As you would be very badly off if you could not think, the brain is your
most precious part, and you have a strong box made of bone to keep it
in.[Illustration: _Diagram of the nervous system._]

We will call the brain the central telegraph office.Little white cords,
called nerves, connect the brain with the rest of the body.A large cord called the spinal cord, lies safely in a bony case made by
the spine, and many nerves branch off from this.If you put your finger on a hot stove, in an instant a message goes on
the nerve telegraph to the brain.It tells that wise thinking part that
your finger will burn, if it stays on the stove.In another instant, the brain sends back a message to the muscles that
move that finger, saying: "Contract quickly, bend the joint, and take
that poor finger away so that it will not be burned."You can hardly believe that there was time for all this sending of
messages; for as soon as you felt the hot stove, you pulled your finger
away.But you really could not have pulled it away, unless the brain had
sent word to the muscles to do it.Now, you know what we mean when we say, "As quick as thought."You see that the brain has a great deal of work to do, for it has to
send so many orders.There are some muscles which are moving quietly and steadily all the
time, though we take no notice of the motion.You do not have to think about breathing, and yet the muscles work all
the time, moving your chest.If we had to think about it every time we breathed, we should have no
time to think of any thing else.There is one part of the brain that takes care of such work for us.It
sends the messages about breathing, and keeps the breathing muscles and
many other muscles faithfully at work.It does all this without our
needing to know or think about it at all.Do you begin to see that your body is a busy work-shop, where many kinds
of work are being done all day and all night?Although we lie still and sleep in the night, the breathing must go on,
and so must the work of those other organs that never stop until we
die.The little white nerve-threads lie smoothly side by side, making small
white cords.Each kind of message goes on its own thread, so that the
messages need never get mixed or confused.They do all the
feeling for the whole body, and by means of them we have many pains and
many pleasures.If there was no nerve in your tooth it could not ache.But if there were
no nerves in your mouth and tongue, you could not taste your food.If there were no nerves in your hands, you might cut them and feel no
pain.But you could not feel your mother's soft, warm hand, as she laid
it on yours.One of your first duties is the care of yourselves.Children may say: "My father and mother take care of me."But even while
you are young, there are some ways in which no one can take care of you
but yourselves.The older you grow, the more this care will belong to
you, and to no one else.Think of the work all the parts of the body do for us, and how they help
us to be well and happy.Certainly the least we can do is to take care
of them and keep them in good order.CARE OF THE BRAIN AND NERVES.As one part of the brain has to take care of all the rest of the body,
and keep every organ at work, of course it can never go to sleep itself.If it did, the heart would stop pumping, the lungs would leave off
breathing, all other work would stop, and the body would be dead.But there is another part of the brain which does the thinking, and this
part needs rest.When you are asleep, you are not thinking, but you are breathing and
other work of the body is going on.If the thinking part of the brain does not have good quiet sleep, it
will soon wear out.A worn-out brain is not easy to repair.If well cared for, your brain will do the best of work for you for
seventy or eighty years without complaining.The nerves are easily tired out, and they need much rest.They get tired
if we do one thing too long at a time; they are rested by a change of
work.IS ALCOHOL GOOD FOR THE NERVES AND THE BRAIN?Think of the wonderful work the brain is all the time doing for you!You ought to give it the best of food to keep it in good working order.Any drink that contains alcohol is not a food to make one strong; but is
a poison to hurt, and at last to kill.It injures the brain and nerves so that they can not work well, and send
their messages properly.That is why the drunkard does not know what he
is about.Newspapers often tell us about people setting houses on fire; about men
who forgot to turn the switch, and so wrecked a railroad train; about
men who lay down on the railroad track and were run over by the cars.Often these stories end with: "The person had been drinking."When the
nerves are put to sleep by alcohol, people become careless and do not do
their work faithfully; sometimes, they can not even tell the difference
between a railroad track and a place of safety.The brain receives no
message, or the wrong one, and the person does not know what he is
doing.You may say that all men who drink liquor do not do such terrible
things.A little alcohol is not so bad as a great deal.But even a
little makes the head ache, and hurts the brain and nerves.A body kept pure and strong is of great service to its owner.There are
people who are not drunkards, but who often drink a little liquor.By
this means, they slowly poison their bodies.When sickness comes upon them, they are less able to bear it, and less
likely to get well again, than those who have never injured their bodies
with alcohol.When a sick or wounded man is brought into the hospital, one of the
first questions asked him by the doctor is: "Do you drink?"the next questions are, "What do you drink?"The answers he gives to these questions, show the doctor what chance the
man has of getting well.A man who never drinks liquor will get well, where a drinking man would
surely die.TOBACCO AND THE NERVES.Because many men say that it helps them, and makes them feel better.Shall I tell you how it makes them feel better?If a man is cold, the tobacco deadens his nerves so that he does not
feel the cold and does not take pains to make himself warmer.If a man is tired, or in trouble, tobacco will not really rest him or
help him out of his trouble.It only puts his nerves to sleep and helps him think that he is not
tired, and that he does not need to overcome his troubles.It puts his nerves to sleep very much as alcohol does, and helps him to
be contented with what ought not to content him.A boy who smokes or chews tobacco, is not so good a scholar as if he did
not use the poison.Usually, too, he is not so polite, nor so good a boy as he otherwise
would be.What message goes to the brain when you put
          your finger on a hot stove?What message comes back from the brain to the
          finger?What is meant by "As quick as thought"?Name some of the muscles which work without
          needing our thought.Why do not the nerve messages get mixed and
          confused?Why could you not feel, if you had no nerves?State some ways in which the nerves give us
          pain.State some ways in which they give us
          pleasure.What part of us has the most work to do?How must we keep the brain strong and well?What does alcohol do to the nerves and brain?Why does not a drunken man know what he is
          about?What causes most of the accidents we read of?Why could not the man who had been drinking
          tell the difference between a railroad track and a
          place of safety?How does the frequent drinking of a little
          liquor affect the body?How does sickness affect people who often
          drink these liquors?When a man is taken to the hospital, what
          questions does the doctor ask?Does it really help a person who uses it?Does tobacco help a boy to be a good scholar?[Illustration: _Bones of the human body._]




CHAPTER IV.[Illustration: R]IPE grapes are full of juice.This juice is mostly water, sweetened with a sugar of its own.It is
flavored with something which makes us know, the moment we taste it,
that it is grape-juice, and not cherry-juice or plum-juice.Apples also contain water, sugar, and apple flavor; and cherries contain
water, sugar, and cherry flavor.They
all, when ripe, have the water and the sugar; and each has a flavor of
its own.Ripe grapes are sometimes gathered and put into great tubs called vats.In some countries, this squeezing is done by bare-footed men who jump
into the vats and press the grapes with their feet.The grape-juice is then drawn off from the skins and seeds and left
standing in a warm place.Bubbles soon begin to rise and cover the top of it with froth.[Illustration: _Picking grapes and making wine._]

If the cook had wished to use this grape-juice to make jelly, she would
say: "Now, I can not make my grape-jelly, for the grape-juice is
spoiled."WHAT IS THIS CHANGE IN THE GRAPE-JUICE?The sugar in the grape-juice is changing into something else.It is
turning into alcohol and a gas[A] that moves about in little bubbles in
the liquid, and rising to the top, goes off into the air.The alcohol is
a thin liquid which, mixed with the water, remains in the grape-juice.The sugar is gone; alcohol and the bubbles of gas are left in its place.A little of it will harm any one who
drinks it; much of it would kill the drinker.Ripe grapes are good food; but grape-juice, when its sugar has turned to
alcohol, is not a safe drink for any one.This changed grape-juice is called wine.It is partly water, partly
alcohol, and it still has the grape flavor in it.Wine is also made from currants, elderberries, and other fruits, in very
much the same way as from grapes.People sometimes make it at home from the fruits that grow in their own
gardens, and think there is no alcohol in it, because they do not put
any in.But you know that the alcohol is made in the fruit-juice itself by the
change of the sugar into alcohol and the gas.[Illustration]

It is the nature of alcohol to make the person who takes a little of it,
in wine, or any other drink, want more and more alcohol.When one goes
on, thus taking more and more of the drinks that contain alcohol, he is
called a drunkard.In this way wine has made many drunkards.Alcohol hurts both the body
and mind.It will make a good and
kind person cruel and bad; and will make a bad person worse.Every one who takes wine does not become a drunkard, but you are not
sure that you will not, if you drink it.You should not drink wine, because there is alcohol in it.In a few hours after the juice is pressed out
of the apples, if it is left open to the air the sugar begins to change.Like the sugar in the grape, it changes into alcohol and bubbles of gas.At first, there is but little alcohol in cider, but a little of this
poison is dangerous.More alcohol is all the time forming until in ten cups of cider there
may be one cup of alcohol.Cider often makes its drinkers ill-tempered
and cross.Cider and wine will turn into vinegar if left in a warm place long
enough.What two things are in all fruit-juices?How can we tell the juice of grapes from that
          of plums?How can we tell the juice of apples from that
          of cherries?What happens after the grape-juice has stood a
          short time?Why would the changed grape-juice not be good
          to use in making jelly?Into what is the sugar in the juice changed?What does alcohol do to those who drink it?When is grape-juice not a safe drink?What is this changed grape-juice called?What do people sometimes think of home-made
          wines?How can alcohol be there when none has been
          put into it?What does alcohol make the person who takes it
          want?Are you sure you will not become a drunkard if
          you drink wine?FOOTNOTE:

[Footnote A: This gas is called car bon'ic acid gas.][Illustration: A]LCOHOL is often made from grains as well as from fruit.If the starch in your mother's starch-box at home should be changed into
sugar, you would think it a very strange thing.Every year, in the spring-time, many thousand pounds of starch are
changed into sugar in a hidden, quiet way, so that most of us think
nothing about it.If you plant them in the ground, where they are kept moist and warm,
they begin to sprout and grow, to send little roots down into the earth,
and little stems up into the sunshine.These little roots and stems must be fed with sugar; thus, in a wise
way, which is too wonderful for you to understand, as soon as the seed
begins to sprout, its starch begins to turn into sugar.[Illustration]

If you should chew two grains of wheat, one before sprouting and one
after, you could tell by the taste that this is true.Barley is a kind of grain from which the brewer makes beer.He must first turn its starch into sugar, so he begins by sprouting his
grain.Of course he does not plant it in the ground, because it would need to
be quickly dug up again.He keeps it warm and moist in a place where he can watch it, and stop
the sprouting just in time to save the sugar, before it is used to feed
the root and stem.The brewer soaks it in plenty of water, because the grain has not water
in itself, as the grape has.He puts in some yeast to help start the work of changing the sugar into
gas[B] and alcohol.Sometimes hops are also put in, to give it a bitter taste.The brewer watches to see the bubbles of gas that tell, as plainly as
words could, that sugar is going and alcohol is coming.When the work is finished, the barley has been made into beer.It might have been ground and made into barley-cakes, or into pearl
barley to thicken our soups, and then it would have been good food.Now,
it is a drink containing alcohol, and alcohol is a poison.You should not drink beer, because there is alcohol in it.Two boys of the same age begin school together.One of them drinks
wine, cider, and beer.The other never allows these drinks to pass his
lips.These boys soon become very different from each other, because one
is poisoning his body and mind with alcohol, and the other is not.A man wants a good, steady boy to work for him.Which of these two do
you think he will select?A few years later, a young man is wanted who
can be trusted with the care of an engine or a bank.Which of these young men will be more likely to get it?What is in the grain that can be turned into
          sugar?What can you do to a seed that will make its
          starch turn into sugar?What does the brewer do to the barley to make
          its starch turn into sugar?What does the brewer put into the malt to start
          the working?How does the brewer know when sugar begins to
          go and alcohol to come?Why does he want the starch turned to sugar?Why did the two boys of the same age, at the
          same school, become so unlike?FOOTNOTE:

[Footnote B: Car bon'ic acid gas.][Illustration: D]ISTILLING (d[)i]s t[)i]l[\l]'ing) may be a new word to
you, but you can easily learn its meaning.You have all seen distilling going on in the kitchen at home, many a
time.When the water in the tea-kettle is boiling, what comes out at the
nose?You can find out what it is by catching some of it on a cold plate, or
tin cover.As soon as it touches any thing cold, it turns into drops of
water.When we boil water and turn it into steam, and then turn the steam back
into water, we have distilled the water.We say vapor instead of steam,
when we talk about the boiling of alcohol.It takes less heat to turn alcohol to vapor than to turn water to
steam; so, if we put over the fire some liquid that contains alcohol,
and begin to collect the vapor as it rises, we shall get alcohol first,
and then water.But the alcohol will not be pure alcohol; it will be part water, because
it is so ready to mix with water that it has to be distilled many times
to be pure.But each time it is distilled, it will become stronger, because there is
a little more alcohol and a little less water.In this way, brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are distilled, from wine,
cider, and the liquors which have been made from corn, rye, or barley.The cider, wine, and beer had but little alcohol in them.The brandy,
rum, whiskey, and gin are nearly one-half alcohol.A glass of strong liquor which has been made by distilling, will injure
any one more, and quicker, than a glass of cider, rum, or beer.But a cider, wine, or beer-drinker often drinks so much more of the
weaker liquor, that he gets a great deal of alcohol.People are often
made drunkards by drinking cider or beer.Where have you ever seen distilling going on?How can men separate alcohol from wine or from
          any other liquor that contains it?Which is the most harmful--the distilled
          liquor, or beer, wine, or cider?Why does the wine, cider, or beer-drinker
          often get as much alcohol?[Illustration: A]LCOHOL looks like water, but it is not at all like
water.Alcohol will take fire, and burn if a lighted match is held near it; but
you know that water will not burn.When alcohol burns, the color of the flame is blue.It does not give
much light: it makes no smoke or soot; but it does give a great deal of
heat.A little dead tree-toad was once put into a bottle of alcohol.It was
years ago, but the tree-toad is there still, looking just as it did the
first day it was put in.The tree-toad would have soon decayed if it had been
put into water.So you see that alcohol keeps dead bodies from
decaying.Pure alcohol is not often used as a drink.People who take beer, wine,
and cider get a little alcohol with each drink.Those who drink brandy,
rum, whiskey, or gin, get more alcohol, because those liquors are nearly
one half alcohol.You may wonder that people wish to use such poisonous drinks at all.It often cheats the man who takes a little, into
thinking it will be good for him to take more.Sometimes the appetite which begs so hard for the poison, is formed in
childhood.If you eat wine-jelly, or wine-sauce, you may learn to like
the taste of alcohol and thus easily begin to drink some weak liquor.The more the drinker takes, the more he often wants, and thus he goes on
from drinking cider, wine, or beer, to drinking whiskey, brandy, or rum.People who are in the habit of taking drinks which contain alcohol,
often care more for them than for any thing else, even when they know
they are being ruined by them.Why should you not eat wine-sauce or
          wine-jelly?[Illustration: A] FARMER who had been in the habit of planting his
fields with corn, wheat, and potatoes, once made up his mind to plant
tobacco instead.Let us see whether he did any good to the world by the change.The tobacco plants grew up as tall as a little boy or girl, and spread
out broad, green leaves.By and by he pulled the stalks, and dried the leaves.Some of them he
pressed into cakes of tobacco; some he rolled into cigars; and some he
ground into snuff.If you ask what tobacco is good for, the best answer will be, to tell
you what it will do to a man or boy who uses it, and then let you answer
the question for yourselves.Tobacco contains something called nicotine (n[)i]k'o t[)i]n).One drop of it is enough to kill a dog.In one cigar
there is enough, if taken pure, to kill two men.[Illustration]

Even to work upon tobacco, makes people pale and sickly.Once I went
into a snuff mill, and the man who had the care of it showed me how the
work was done.The mill stood in a pretty place, beside a little stream which turned
the mill-wheel.Tall trees bent over it, and a fresh breeze was blowing
through the open windows.Yet the smell of the tobacco was so strong
that I had to go to the door many times, for a breath of pure air.I asked the man if it did not make him sick to work there.He said: "It made me very sick for the first few weeks.Then I began to
get used to it, and now I don't mind it."He was like the boys who try to learn to smoke.It almost always makes
them sick at first; but they think it will be manly to keep on.At last,
they get used to it.The sickness is really the way in which the boy's body is trying to say
to him: "There is danger here; you are playing with poison.Let me stop
you before great harm is done."Perhaps you will say: "I have seen men smoke cigars, even four or five
in a day, and it didn't kill them."It did not kill them, because they did not swallow the nicotine.They
only drew in a little with the breath.But taking a little poison in
this way, day after day, can not be safe, or really helpful to any one.What did the farmer plant instead of corn,
          wheat, and potatoes?What is the name of the poison which is in
          tobacco?How much of it is needed to kill a dog?What harm can the nicotine in one cigar do, if
          taken pure?Tell the story of the visit to the snuff mill.Why are boys made sick by their first use of
          tobacco?Why does not smoking a cigar kill a man?[Illustration: A]LCOHOL and tobacco are called narcotics (nar
k[)o]t'iks).This means that they have the power of putting the nerves
to sleep.Opium ([=o]'p[)i] [)u]m) is another narcotic.It is a poison made from the juice of poppies, and is used in medicines.Opium is put into soothing-syrups (s[)i]r'[)u]ps), and these are
sometimes given to babies to keep them from crying.They do this by
injuring the tender nerves and poisoning the little body.How can any one give a baby opium to save taking patient care of it?Surely the mothers would not do it, if they knew that this
soothing-syrup that appears like a friend, coming to quiet and comfort
the baby, is really an enemy.[Illustration: _Don't give soothing-syrup to children._]

Sometimes, a child no older than some of you are, is left at home with
the care of a baby brother or sister; so it is best that you should know
about this dangerous enemy, and never be tempted to quiet the baby by
giving him a poison, instead of taking your best and kindest care of
him.CHAPTER X.

WHAT ARE ORGANS?[Illustration: A]N organ is a part of the body which has some special
work to do.The stomach (st[)u]m'[)a]k)
is an organ which takes care of the food we eat.[Illustration: _Different kinds of teeth._]

Your teeth do not look alike, since they must do different kinds of
work.The front ones cut, the back ones grind.They are made of a kind of bone covered with a hard smooth enamel ([)e]n
[)a]m'el).If the enamel is broken, the teeth soon decay and ache, for
each tooth is furnished with a nerve that very quickly feels pain.Cracking nuts with the teeth, or even biting thread, is apt to break the
enamel; and when once broken, you will wish in vain to have it mended.The dentist can fill a hole in the tooth; but he can not cover the tooth
with new enamel.Bits of food should be carefully picked from between the teeth with a
tooth-pick of quill or wood, never with a pin or other hard and sharp
thing which might break the enamel.Nothing but perfect cleanliness
will keep them in good order.Your
breakfast will taste all the better for it.Brush them at night before
you go to bed, lest some food should be decaying in your mouth during
the night.Take care of these cutters and grinders, that they may not decay, and so
be unable to do their work well.You have learned about the twenty-four little bones in the spine, and
the ribs that curve around from the spine to the front, or breast-bone.These bones, with the shoulder-blades and the collar-bones, form a bony
case or box.In it are some of the most useful organs of the body.This box is divided across the middle by a strong muscle, so that we may
say it is two stories high.The upper room is called the chest; the lower one, the abdomen ([)a]b
d[=o]'m[)e]n).In the chest, are the heart and the lungs.In the abdomen, are the stomach, the liver, and some other organs.The stomach is a strong bag, as wonderful a bag as could be made, you
will say, when I tell you what it can do.The outside is made of muscles; the lining prepares a juice called
gastric (g[)a]s'tr[)i]k) juice, and keeps it always ready for use.Now, what would you think if a man could put into a bag, beef, and
apples, and potatoes, and bread and milk, and sugar, and salt, tie up
the bag and lay it away on a shelf for a few hours, and then show you
that the beef had disappeared, so had the apples, so had the potatoes,
the bread and milk, sugar, and salt, and the bag was filled only with a
thin, grayish fluid?Now, your stomach and mine are just such magical bags.We put in our breakfasts, dinners, and suppers; and, after a few hours,
they are changed.The gastric juice has been mixed with them.The strong
muscles that form the outside of the stomach have been squeezing the
food, rolling it about, and mixing it together, until it has all been
changed to a thin, grayish fluid.A soldier was once shot in the side in such a way that when the wound
healed, it left an opening with a piece of loose skin over it, like a
little door leading into his stomach.A doctor who wished to learn about the stomach, hired him for a servant
and used to study him every day.He would push aside the little flap of skin and put into the stomach any
kind of food that he pleased, and then watch to see what happened to it.In this way, he learned a great deal and wrote it down, so that other
people might know, too.In other ways, also, which it would take too
long to tell you here, doctors have learned how these magical food-bags
take care of our food.WHY DOES THE FOOD NEED TO BE CHANGED?Your mamma tells you sometimes at breakfast that you must eat oat-meal
and milk to make you grow into a big man or woman.Did you ever wonder what part of you is made of oat-meal, or what part
of milk?That stout little arm does not look like oat-meal; those rosy cheeks do
not look like milk.If our food is to make stout arms and rosy cheeks, strong bodies and
busy brains, it must first be changed into a form in which it can get to
each part and feed it.When the food in the stomach is mixed and prepared, it is ready to be
sent through the body; some is carried to the bones, some to the
muscles, some to the nerves and brain, some to the skin, and some even
to the finger nails, the hair, and the eyes.Each part needs to be fed
in order to grow.WHY DO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GROWING NEED FOOD?Children need each day to make larger and larger bones, larger muscles,
and a larger skin to cover the larger body.Every day, each part is also wearing out a little, and needing to be
mended by some new food.People who have grown up, need their food for
this work of mending.One way to take care of the stomach is to give it only its own work to
do.I have seen some children who want to
make their poor stomachs work all the time.They are always eating
apples, or candy, or something, so that their stomachs have no chance to
rest.If the stomach does not rest, it will wear out the same as a
machine would.The stomach can not work well, unless it is quite warm.If a person
pours ice-water into his stomach as he eats, just as the food is
beginning to change into the gray fluid of which you have learned, the
work stops until the stomach gets warm again.ALCOHOL AND THE STOMACH.You remember about the man who had the little door to his stomach.Sometimes, the doctor put in wine, cider, brandy, or some drink that
contained alcohol, to see what it would do.It was carried away very
quickly; but during the little time it stayed, it did nothing but harm.It injured the gastric juice, so that it could not mix with the food.If the doctor had put in more alcohol, day after day, as one does who
drinks liquor, sores would perhaps have come on the delicate lining of
the stomach.Sometimes the stomach is so hurt by alcohol, that the
drinker dies.If the stomach can not do its work well, the whole body
must suffer from want of the good food it needs.[C]


TOBACCO AND THE MOUTH.The saliva in the mouth helps to prepare the food, before it goes into
the stomach.Tobacco makes the mouth very dry, and more saliva has to
flow out to moisten it.But tobacco juice is mixed with the saliva, and that must not be
swallowed.It must be spit out, and with it is sent the saliva that was
needed to help prepare the food.Tobacco discolors the teeth, makes bad sores in the mouth, and often
causes a disease of the throat.You can tell where some people have been, by the neatness and comfort
they leave after them.You can tell where the tobacco-user has been, by the dirty floor, and
street, and the air made unfit to breathe, because of the smoke and
strong, bad smell of old tobacco from his pipe and cigar and from his
breath and clothes.the back
          teeth?What is the upper room of this box called?the
          lower room?What do the stomach and the gastric juice do
          to the food we have eaten?How did anybody find out what the stomach
          could do?Why must all the food we eat be changed?Why do people who are not growing need food?What does alcohol do to the gastric juice?to
          the stomach?How does the habit of spitting injure a
          person?How does the tobacco-user annoy other people?FOOTNOTE:

[Footnote C: The food is partly prepared by the liver and some other
organs.]WHAT DOES THE BODY NEED FOR FOOD?[Illustration: N]OW that you know how the body is fed, you must next
learn what to feed it with; and what each part needs to make it grow and
to keep it strong and well.A large part of your body is made of water.So you need, of course, to
drink water, and to have it used in preparing your food.Water comes from the clouds, and is stored up in cisterns or in springs
in the ground.From these pipes are laid to lead the water to our
houses.Sometimes, men dig down until they reach a spring, and so make a well
from which they can pump the water, or dip it out with a bucket.Water that has been standing in lead pipes, may have some of the lead
mixed with it.Such water would be very likely to poison you, if you
drank it.Impurities are almost sure to soak into a well if it is near a drain or
a stable.If you drink the water from such a well, you may be made very sick by
it.It is better to go thirsty, until you can get good water.A sufficient quantity of pure water to drink is just as important for
us, as good food to eat.We could not drink all the water that our bodies need.We take a large
part of it in our food, in fruits and vegetables, and even in beefsteak
and bread.You remember the bone that was nothing but crumbling
lime after it had been in the fire.We can not eat lime; but the grass and the grains take it out of the
earth.Then the cows eat the grass and turn it into milk, and in the
milk we drink, we get some of the lime to feed our bones.[Illustration: _Lime being prepared for our use._]

In the same way, the grain growing in the field takes up lime and other
things that we need, but could not eat for ourselves.The lime that thus
becomes a part of the grain, we get in our bread, oat-meal porridge, and
other foods.Animals need salt, as children who live in the country know very well.They have seen how eagerly the cows and the sheep lick up the salt that
the farmer gives them.Even wild cattle and buffaloes seek out places where there are salt
springs, and go in great herds to get the salt.We, too, need some salt mixed with our food.If we did not put it in,
either when cooking, or afterward, we should still get a little in the
food itself.Muscles are lean meat, that is flesh; so muscles need flesh-making
foods.These are milk, and grains like wheat, corn and oats; also, meat
and eggs.Most of these foods really come to us out of the ground.Meat
and eggs are made from the grain, grass, and other vegetables that the
cattle and hens eat.We need cushions and wrappings of fat, here and there in our bodies, to
keep us warm and make us comfortable.So we must have certain kinds of
food that will make fat.[Illustration: _Esquimaux catching walrus._]

There are right places and wrong places for fat, as well as for other
things in this world.When alcohol puts fat into the muscles, that is
fat badly made, and in the wrong place.The good fat made for the parts of the body which need it, comes from
fat-making foods.In cold weather, we need more fatty food than we do in summer, just as
in cold countries people need such food all the time.The Esquimaux, who live in the lands of snow and ice, catch a great many
walrus and seal, and eat a great deal of fat meat.You would not be well
unless you ate some fat or butter or oil.Sugar will make fat, and so will starch, cream, rice, butter, and fat
meat.As milk will make muscle and fat and bones, it is the best kind of
food.Here, again, it is the earth that sends us our food.Fat meat
comes from animals well fed on grain and grass; sugar, from sugar-cane,
maple-trees, or beets; oil, from olive-trees; butter, from cream; and
starch, from potatoes, and from corn, rice, and other grains.Green apples and other unripe fruits are not yet ready to be eaten.The
starch which we take for food has to be changed into sugar, before it
can mix with the blood and help feed the body.As the sun ripens fruit,
it changes its starch to sugar.You can tell this by the difference in
the taste of ripe and unripe apples.Most children like candy so well, that they are in danger of eating more
sugar than is good for them.We would not need to be quite so much afraid of a little candy if it
were not for the poison with which it is often.Even what is called pure, white candy is sometimes not really such.There is a simple way by which you can find this out for yourselves.If you put a spoonful of sugar into a tumbler of water, it will all
dissolve and disappear.Put a piece of white candy into a tumbler of
water; and, if it is made of pure sugar only, it will dissolve and
disappear.If it is not, you will find at the bottom of the tumbler some white
earth.Candy-makers often put it
into candy in place of sugar, because it is cheaper than sugar.Why is it not safe to drink water that has been
          standing in lead pipes?Why is the water of a well that is near a drain
          or a stable, not fit to drink?What is said of the fat made by alcohol?How does the sun change unripe fruits?HOW FOOD BECOMES PART OF THE BODY.[Illustration: H]ERE, at last, is the bill of fare for our dinner:

          Roast beef,
          Potatoes,
          Tomatoes,
          Squash,
          Bread,
          Butter,
          Salt,
          Water,
          Peaches,
          Bananas,
          Oranges,
          Grapes.What must be done first, with the different kinds of food that are to
make up this dinner?The meat, vegetables, and bread must be cooked.Cooking prepares them to
be easily worked upon by the mouth and stomach.If they were not cooked,
this work would be very hard.Instead of going on quietly and without
letting us know any thing about it, there would be pains and aches in
the overworked stomach.The fruit is not cooked by a fire; but we might almost say the sun had
cooked it, for the sun has ripened and sweetened it.When you are older, some of you may have charge of the cooking in your
homes.You must then remember that food well cooked is worth twice as
much as food poorly cooked."A good cook has more to do with the health of the family, than a good
doctor."As soon as we begin to chew our food, a juice in the mouth, called
saliva (sa l[=i]'va), moistens and mixes with it.Saliva has the wonderful power of turning starch into sugar; and the
starch in our food needs to be turned into sugar, before it can be taken
into the blood.You can prove for yourselves that saliva can turn starch into sugar.Chew slowly a piece of dry cracker.The cracker is made mostly of
starch, because wheat is full of starch.At first, the cracker is dry
and tasteless.Soon, however, you find it tastes sweet; the saliva is
changing the starch into sugar.All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva
may be able to mix with it.Otherwise, the starch may not be changed;
and if one part of your body neglects its work, another part will have
more than its share to do.If you swallow your food in a hurry and do not let the saliva do its
work, the stomach will have extra work.But it will find it hard to do
more than its own part, and, perhaps, will complain.It can not speak in words; but will by aching, and that is almost as
plain as words.One is to the lungs, for
breathing; the other, to the stomach, for swallowing.Do you wonder why the food does not sometimes go down the wrong way?The windpipe leading to the lungs is in front of the other tube.It has
at its top a little trap-door.This opens when we breathe and shuts when
we swallow, so that the food slips over it safely into the passage
behind, which leads to the stomach.If you try to speak while you have food in your mouth, this little door
has to open, and some bit of food may slip in.The windpipe will not
pass it to the lungs, but tries to force it back.Then we say the food
chokes us.If the windpipe can not succeed in forcing back the food, the
person will die.HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY.But we will suppose that the food of our dinner has gone safely down
into the stomach.There the stomach works it over, and mixes in gastric
juice, until it is all a gray fluid.Now it is ready to go into the intestines,--a long, coiled tube which
leads out of the stomach,--from which the prepared food is taken into
the blood.The heart pumps it out with the blood
into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle,
and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain.Besides feeding all these parts, this dinner can help to mend any parts
that may be broken.Suppose a boy should break one of the bones of his arm, how could it be
mended?If you should bind together the two parts of a broken stick and leave
them a while, do you think they would grow together?But the doctor could carefully bind together the ends of the broken bone
in the boy's arm and leave it for awhile, and the blood would bring it
bone food every day, until it had grown together again.So a dinner can both make and mend the different parts of the body.What is the first thing to do to our food?What is the first thing to do after taking the
          food into your mouth?How can you prove that saliva turns starch into
          sugar?What happens if the food is not chewed and
          mixed with the saliva?What must you be careful about, when you are
          swallowing?What happens to the food after it is
          swallowed?What carries the food to every part of the
          body?[Illustration: H]ERE are the names of some of the different kinds of
food.If you write them on the blackboard or on your slates, it will

Perhaps some of you noticed that we had no wine, beer, nor any drink
that had alcohol in it, on our bill of fare for dinner.We had no
cigars, either, to be smoked after dinner.If these are good things, we
ought to have had them._We should eat in order to grow strong and keep
          strong._


STRENGTH OF BODY.If you wanted to measure your strength, one way of doing so would be to
fasten a heavy weight to one end of a rope and pass the rope over a
pulley.Then you might take hold at the other end of the rope and pull
as hard and steadily as you could, marking the place to which you raised
the weight.By trying this once a week, or once a month, you could tell
by the marks, whether you were gaining strength.We must exercise in the open air, and take pure air into our lungs to
help purify our blood, and plenty of exercise to make our muscles grow.We must eat good and simple food, that the blood may have supplies to
take to every part of the body.People used to think that alcohol made them strong.Can alcohol make good muscles, or bone, or nerve, or brain?If it can not make muscles, nor bone nor nerve, nor brain, it can not
give you any strength.Some people may tell you that drinking beer will make you strong.The grain from which the beer is made, would have given you strength.If
you should measure your strength before and after drinking beer, you
would find that you had not gained any.Most of the food part of the
grain has been turned into alcohol.The juice of crushed apples, you know, is called cider.As soon as the
cider begins to turn sour, or "hard," as people say, alcohol begins to
form in it.Pure water is good, and apples are good.But the apple-juice begins to
be a poison as soon as there is the least drop of alcohol in it.In
cider-making, the alcohol forms in the juice, you know, in a few hours
after it is pressed out of the apples.None of the drinks in which there is alcohol, can give you real
strength.Because alcohol puts the nerves to sleep, they can not, truly, tell the
brain how hard the work is, or how heavy the weight to be lifted.The alcohol has in this way cheated men into thinking they can do more
than they really can.This false feeling of strength lasts only a little
while.When it has passed, men feel weaker than before.A story which shows that alcohol does not give strength, was told me by
the captain of a ship, who sailed to China and other distant places.Many years ago, when people thought a little alcohol was good, it was
the custom to carry in every ship, a great deal of rum.This liquor is
distilled from molasses and contains about one half alcohol.This rum
was given to the sailors every day to drink; and, if there was a great
storm, and they had very hard work to do, it was the custom to give
them twice as much rum as usual.[Illustration]

The captain watched his men and saw that they were really made no
stronger by drinking the rum; but that, after a little while, they felt
weaker.So he determined to go to sea with no rum in his ship.Once out
on the ocean, of course the men could not get any.At first, they did not like it; but the captain was very careful to have
their food good and plentiful; and, when a storm came, and they were wet
and cold and tired, he gave them hot coffee to drink.By the time they
had crossed the ocean, the men said: "The captain is right.We have
worked better, and we feel stronger, for going without the rum."We have been talking about the strength of muscles; but the very best
kind of strength we have is brain strength, or strength of mind.Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can
not carry their messages correctly.Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every
person ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make
him useful and happy.Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to
work, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole.Would you
be willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been
poisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a
palace, and had a million of dollars?If you want a mind that can study, understand, and think well, do not
let alcohol and tobacco have a chance to reach it.What things were left out of our bill of fare?Show why drinking wine or any other alcoholic
          drink will not make you strong.Why do people imagine that they feel strong
          after taking these drinks?Tell the story which shows that alcohol does
          not help sailors do their work.What is the best kind of strength to have?How does alcohol affect the strength of the
          mind?[Illustration: T]HE heart is in the chest, the upper part of the strong
box which the ribs, spine, shoulder-blades, and collar-bones make for
each of us.It is made of very thick, strong muscles, as you can see by looking at a
beef's heart, which is much like a man's, but larger.Probably some of you have seen a fire-engine throwing a stream of water
through a hose upon a burning building.As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the
working of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped
like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the
body.These tubes are called arteries (aer't[)e]r iz).Those tubes which bring the blood back again to the heart, are called
veins (v[=a]nz).You can see some of the smaller veins in your wrist.If you press your finger upon an artery in your wrist, you can feel the
steady beating of the pulse.This tells just how fast the heart is
pumping and the blood flowing.The doctor feels your pulse when you are sick, to find out whether the
heart is working too fast, or too slowly, or just right.Some way is needed to send the gray fluid that is made from the food we
eat and drink, to every part of the body.To send the food with the blood is a sure way of making it reach every
part.So, when the stomach has prepared the food, the blood takes it up and
carries it to every part of the body.It then leaves with each part,
just what it needs.As the brain has so much work to attend to, it must have very pure, good
blood sent to it, to keep it strong.It can not be good if it has been poisoned with alcohol or tobacco.We must also remember that the brain needs a great deal of blood.If we
take alcohol into our blood, much of it goes to the brain.There it
affects the nerves, and makes a man lose control over his actions.When you run, you can feel your heart beating.It gets an instant of
rest between the beats.Good exercise in the fresh air makes the heart work well and warms the
body better than a fire could do.DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE HEART?You know what harm alcohol does to the
muscles.Could a fatty heart work as well as a muscular heart?No more than a
fatty arm could do the work of a muscular arm.Besides, alcohol makes
the heart beat too fast, and so it gets too tired.How does the food we eat reach all parts of the
          body?How does alcohol in the blood affect the brain?How does exercise in the fresh air help the
          heart?[Illustration: T]HE blood flows all through the body, carrying good food
to every part.It also gathers up from every part the worn-out matter
that can no longer be used.By the time it is ready to be sent back by
the veins, the blood is no longer pure and red.It is dull and bluish in
color, because it is full of impurities.If you look at the veins in your wrist, you will see that they look
blue.If all this bad blood goes back to the heart, will the heart have to
pump out bad blood next time?No, for the heart has neighbors very near
at hand, ready to change the bad blood to pure, red blood again.They are in the chest on each side of
the heart.When you breathe, their little air-cells swell out, or
expand, to take in the air.Then they contract again, and the air passes
out through your mouth or nose.The lungs must have plenty of fresh air,
and plenty of room to work in.[Illustration: _The lungs, heart, and air-passages._]

If your clothes are too tight and the lungs do not have room to expand,
they can not take in so much air as they should.Then the blood can not
be made pure, and the whole body will suffer.For every good breath of fresh air, the lungs take in, they send out one
of impure air.In this way, by taking out what is bad, they prepare the blood to go
back to the heart pure and red, and to be pumped out through the body
again.How the lungs can use the fresh air for doing this good work, you can
not yet understand.By and by, when you are older, you will learn more
about it.You never stop breathing, not even in the night.But if you watch your
own breathing you will notice a little pause between the breaths.But the lungs are very steady workers, both by night
and by day.The least we can do for them, is to give them fresh air and
plenty of room to work in.You may say: "We can't give them more room than they have.I have seen people who wore such tight clothes that their lungs did not
have room to take a full breath.If any part of the lungs can not
expand, it will become useless.If your lungs can not take in air enough
to purify the blood, you can not be so well and strong as God intended,
and your life will be shortened.If some one was sewing for you, you would not think of shutting her up
in a little place where she could not move her hands freely.The lungs
are breathing for you, and need room enough to do their work.The lungs breathe out the waste matter that they have taken from the
blood.If we should close all the
doors and windows, and the fireplace or opening into the chimney, and
leave not even a crack by which the fresh air could come in, we would
die simply from staying in such a room.The lungs could not do their
work for the blood, and the blood could not do its work for the body.If your head
aches, and you feel dull and sleepy from being in a close room, a run in
the fresh air will make you feel better.The good, pure air makes your blood pure; and the blood then flows
quickly through your whole body and refreshes every part.We must be careful not to stay in close rooms in the day-time, nor sleep
in close rooms at night.We must not keep out the fresh air that our
bodies so much need.It is better to breathe through the nose than through the mouth.You can
soon learn to do so, if you try to keep your mouth shut when walking or
running.If you keep the mouth shut and breathe through the nose, the little
hairs on the inside of the nose will catch the dust or other impurities
that are floating in the air, and so save their going to the lungs.You
will get out of breath less quickly when running if you keep your mouth
shut.DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE LUNGS?The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (m[)u]s'ku
lar) walls.Every time we breathe, these walls have to move.The muscles
of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you
breathe.All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is
directed by the nerves.You have learned already what alcohol will do to muscles and nerves, so
you are ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and for lungs.Besides carrying food all over the body, what
          other work does the blood do?Why does the blood in the veins look blue?Where is the blood made pure and red again?What must the lungs have in order to do this
          work?How does the air in a room become spoiled?Why is it better to breathe through the nose
          than through the mouth?[Illustration: T]HERE is another part of your body carrying away waste
matter all the time--it is the skin.It is also lined with a more delicate
kind of skin.You can see where the outside skin and the lining skin
meet at your lips.There is a thin outside layer of skin which we can pull off without
hurting ourselves; but I advise you not to do so.Because under the
outside skin is the true skin, which is so full of little nerves that it
will feel the least touch as pain.When the outer skin, which protects
it, is torn away, we must cover the true skin to keep it from harm.In hot weather, or when any one has been working or playing hard, the
face, and sometimes the whole body, is covered with little drops of
water.We call these drops perspiration (p[~e]r sp[)i] r[=a]'sh[)u]n).[Illustration: _Perspiratory tube._]

Where does it come from?It comes through many tiny holes in the skin,
called pores (p[=o]rz).Every pore is the mouth of a tiny tube which is
carrying off waste matter and water from your body.If you could piece
together all these little perspiration tubes that are in the skin of one
person, they would make a line more than three miles long.Sometimes, you can not see the perspiration, because there is not enough
of it to form drops.But it is always coming out through your skin, both
in winter and summer.Your body is kept healthy by having its worn-out
matter carried off in this way, as well as in other ways.The finger nails are little shields to protect the ends of your fingers
from getting hurt.These finger ends are full of tiny nerves, and would
be badly off without such shields.No one likes to see nails that have
been bitten.Waste matter is all the time passing out through the perspiration tubes
in the skin.This waste matter must not be left to clog up the little
openings of the tubes.It should be washed off with soap and water.When children have been playing out-of-doors, they often have very dirty
hands and faces.Any one can see, then, that they need to be washed.But
even if they had been in the cleanest place all day and had not touched
any thing dirty, they would still need the washing; for the waste matter
that comes from the inside of the body is just as hurtful as the mud or
dust of the street.You do not see it so plainly, because it comes out
very little at a time.Wash it off well, and your skin will be fresh and
healthy, and able to do its work.If the skin could not do its work, you
would die.Do not keep on your rubber boots or shoes all through school-time.Rubber will not let the perspiration pass off, so the little pores get
clogged and your feet begin to feel uncomfortable, or your head may
ache.No part can fail to do its work without causing trouble to the
rest of the body.But you should always wear rubbers out-of-doors when
the ground is wet.When you are out in the fresh air, you are giving the other parts of
your body such a good chance to perspire, that your feet can bear a
little shutting up.But as soon as you come into the house, take the
rubbers off.Now that you know what the skin is doing all the time, you will
understand that the clothes worn next to your skin are full of little
worn-out particles, brought out by the perspiration.When these clothes
are taken off at night, they should be so spread out, that they will
air well before morning.Never wear any of the clothes through the
night, that you have worn during the day.Do not roll up your night-dress in the morning and put it under your
pillow.Give it first a good airing at the window and then hang it where
the air can reach it all day.By so doing, you will have sweeter sleep
at night.You are old enough to throw the bed-clothes off from the bed, before
leaving your rooms in the morning.In this way, the bed and bed-clothes
may have a good airing.Be sure to give them time enough for this.You have now learned about four important kinds of work:--

1st.The stomach prepares the food for the blood to take.The blood is pumped out of the heart to carry food to every part of
the body, and to take away worn-out matter.The lungs use fresh air in making the dark, impure blood, bright and
pure again.The skin carries away waste matter through the little perspiration
tubes.All this work goes on, day and night, without our needing to think about
it at all; for messages are sent to the muscles by the nerves which keep
them faithfully at work, whether we know it or not.What is the common name
          for it?How does the perspiration help to keep you
          well?Why should you not wear rubber boots or
          overshoes in the house?Why should you change under-clothing night and
          morning?Where should the night-dress be placed in the
          morning?What should be done with the bed-clothes?Name the four kinds of work about which you
          have learned.How are the organs of the body kept at work?[Illustration: W]E have five ways of learning about all things around
us.We can see them, touch them, taste them, smell them, or hear them.Sight, touch, taste, smell, and hearing, are called the five senses.You already know something about them, for you are using them all the
time.In this lesson, you will learn a little more about seeing and hearing.In the middle of your eye is a round, black spot, called the pupil.This
pupil is only a hole with a muscle around it.When you are in the light,
the muscle draws up, and makes the pupil small, because you can get all
the light you need through a small opening.When you are in the dark,
the muscle stretches, and opens the pupil wide to let in more light.The pupils of the cat's eyes are very large in the dark.They want all
the light they can get, to see if there are any mice about.[Illustration: _The eyelashes and the tear-glands._]

The pupil of the eye opens into a little, round room where the nerve of
sight is.This is a safe place for this delicate nerve, which can not
bear too much light.It carries to the brain an account of every thing
we see.We might say the eye is taking pictures for us all day long, and that
the nerve of sight is describing these pictures to the brain.The nerves of sight need great care, for they are very delicate.Do not face a bright light when you are reading or studying.While
writing, you should sit so that the light will come from the left side;
then the shadow of your hand will not fall upon your work.One or two true stories may help you to remember that you must take good
care of your eyes.The nerve of sight can not bear too bright a light.It asks to have the
pupil made small, and even the eyelid curtains put down, when the light
is too strong.Once, there was a boy who said boastfully to his playmates: "Let us see
which of us can look straight at the sun for the longest time."Then they foolishly began to look at the sun.The delicate nerves of
sight felt a sharp pain, and begged to have the pupils made as small as
possible and the eyelid curtains put down.They were trying to see which would bear
it the longest.Great harm was done to the brains as well as eyes of
both these boys.The one who looked longest at the sun died in
consequence of his foolish act.The second story is about a little boy who tried to turn his eyes to
imitate a schoolmate who was cross-eyed.He turned them; but he could
not turn them back again.Although he is now a gentleman more than fifty
years old and has had much painful work done upon his eyes, the doctors
have never been able to set them quite right.You see from the first story, that you must be careful not to give your
eyes too much light.But you must also be sure to give them light
enough.When one tries to read in the twilight, the little nerve of sight says:
"Give me more light; I am hurt, by trying to see in the dark."If you should kill these delicate nerves, no others would ever grow in
place of them, and you would never be able to see again.What you call your ears are only pieces of gristle, so curved as to
catch the sounds and pass them along to the true ears.These are deeper
in the head, where the nerve of hearing is waiting to send an account
of each sound to the brain.The ear nerve is in less danger than that of the eye.Careless children
sometimes put pins into their ears and so break the "drum."That is a
very bad thing to do.Use only a soft towel in washing your ears.You
should never put any thing hard or sharp into them.I must tell you a short ear story, about my father, when he was a small
boy.One day, when playing on the floor, he laid his ear to the crack of the
door, to feel the wind blow into it.He was so young that he did not
know it was wrong; but the next day he had the earache severely.Although he lived to be an old man, he often had the earache.He thought
it began from the time when the wind blew into his ear from under that
door.ALCOHOL AND THE SENSES.All this fine work of touching, tasting, seeing, smelling, and hearing,
is nerve work.The man who is in the habit of using alcoholic drinks can not touch,
taste, see, smell, or hear so well as he ought.His hands tremble, his
speech is sometimes thick, and often he can not walk straight.Sometimes, he thinks he sees things when he does not, because his poor
nerves are so confused by alcohol that they can not do their work.Answer now for your taste, smell, and touch, and also for your sight and
hearing; should their beautiful work be spoiled by alcohol?Where should the light be for reading or
          studying?Tell the story of the boys who looked at the
          sun.Tell the story of the boy who made himself
          cross-eyed.What would be the result, if you should kill
          the nerves of sight?Tell the story of the boy who injured his ear.How is the work of the senses affected by
          drinking liquor?"[Illustration: M]Y thick, warm clothes make me warm," says some child.Take a brisk run, and your blood will flow faster and you will be warm
very quickly.On a cold day, the teamster claps his hands and swings his arms to make
his blood flow quickly and warm him.Every child knows that he is warm inside; for if his fingers are cold,
he puts them into his mouth to warm them.If you should put a little thermometer into your mouth, or under your
tongue, the mercury (m[~e]r'ku r[)y]) would rise as high as it does out
of doors on a hot, summer day.This would be the same in summer or winter, in a warm country or a cold
one, if you were well and the work of your body was going on steadily.Some of the work which is all the time going on inside your body, makes
this heat.The blood is thus warmed, and then it carries the heat to every part of
the body.The faster the blood flows, the more heat it brings, and the
warmer we feel.In children, the heart pumps from eighty to ninety times a minute.This is faster than it works in old people, and this is one reason why
children are generally much warmer than old people.You may breathe in cold air; but that which you breathe out is warm.A
great deal of heat from your warm body is all the time passing off
through your skin, into the cooler air about you.For this reason, a
room full of people is much warmer than the same room when empty.We put on clothes to keep in the heat which we already have, and to
prevent the cold air from reaching our skins and carrying off too much
heat in that way.Most of you children are too young to choose what clothes you will wear.You know, however, that woolen under-garments
keep you warm in winter, and that thick boots and stockings should be
worn in cold weather.Thin dresses or boots may look pretty; but they
are not safe for winter wear, even at a party.A healthy, happy child, dressed in clothes which are suitable for the
season, is pleasanter to look at than one whose dress, though rich and
handsome, is not warm enough for health or comfort.When you feel cold, take exercise, if possible.This will make the hot
blood flow all through your body and warm it.If you can not, you should
put on more clothes, go to a warm room, in some way get warm and keep
warm, or the cold will make you sick.If your skin is chilled, the tiny mouths of the perspiration tubes are
sometimes closed and can not throw out the waste matter.Then, if one
part fails to do its work, other parts must suffer.Perhaps the inside
skin becomes inflamed, or the throat and lungs, and you have a cold, or
a cough.People used to think that nothing would warm one so well on a cold day,
as a glass of whiskey, or other alcoholic drink.It is true that, if a person drinks a little alcohol, he will feel a
burning in the throat, and presently a glowing heat on the skin.The alcohol has made the hot blood rush into the tiny tubes near the
skin, and he thinks it has warmed him.But if all this heat comes to the skin, the cold air has a chance to
carry away more than usual.In a very little time, the drinker will be
colder than before.Perhaps he will not know it; for the cheating
alcohol will have deadened his nerves so that they send no message to
the brain.Then he may not have sense enough to put on more clothing and
may freeze.He may even, if it is very cold, freeze to death.People, who have not been drinking alcohol are sometimes frozen; but
they would have frozen much quicker if they had drunk it.Horse-car drivers and omnibus drivers have a hard time on a cold winter
day.They are often cheated into thinking that alcohol will keep them
warm; but doctors have learned that it is the water-drinkers who hold
out best against the cold.Alcohol can not really keep a person warm.All children are interested in stories about Arctic explorers, whose
ships get frozen into great ice-fields, who travel on sledges drawn by
dogs, and sometimes live in Esquimau huts, and drink oil, and eat walrus
meat.These men tell us that alcohol will not keep them warm, and you know
why.The hunters and trappers in the snowy regions of the Rocky Mountains say
the same thing.Alcohol not only can not keep them warm; but it lessens
their power to resist cold.[Illustration: _Scene in the Arctic regions._]

Many of you have heard about the Greely party who were brought home from
the Arctic seas, after they had been starving and freezing for many
months.Seven were
found alive by their rescuers; one of these died soon afterward.The
first man who died, was the only one of the party who had ever been a
drunkard.Of the nineteen who died, all but one used tobacco.Of the six now
living,--four never used tobacco at all; and the other two, very seldom.The tobacco was no real help to them in time of trouble.It had probably
weakened their stomachs, so that they could not make the best use of
such poor food as they had.Why do you wear thick clothes in cold weather?How can you prove that you are warm inside?How can you warm yourself without going to the
          fire?How does it cheat you into thinking that you
          will be warmer for drinking it?What do the people who travel in very cold
          countries, tell us about the use of alcohol?How did tobacco affect the men who went to the
          Arctic seas with Lieutenant Greely?[Illustration: N]OW that you have learned about your bodies, and what
alcohol will do to them, you ought also to know that alcohol costs a
great deal of money.Money spent for that which will do no good, but
only harm, is certainly wasted, and worse than wasted.If a boy or a girl save ten cents a week, it will take ten weeks to save
a dollar.You can all think of many good and pleasant ways to spend a dollar.What
would the beer-drinker do with it?If he takes two mugs of beer a day,
the dollar will be used up in ten days.But we ought not to say used,
because that word will make us think it was spent usefully.We will say,
instead, the dollar will be wasted, in ten days.If he spends it for wine or whiskey, it will go sooner, as these cost
more.If no money was spent for liquor in this country, people would not
so often be sick, or poor, or bad, or wretched.We should not need so
many policemen, and jails, and prisons, as we have now.If no liquor was
drunk, men, women, and children would be better and happier.Most of you have a little money of your own.Perhaps you earned a part,
or the whole of it, yourselves.You are planning what to do with it, and
that is a very pleasant kind of planning.Do you think it would be wise to make a dollar bill into a tight little
roll, light one end of it with a match, and then let it slowly burn up?(_See Frontispiece._)

Yes!It would be worse than wasted,
if, while burning, it should also hurt the person who held it.If you
should buy cigars or tobacco with your dollar, and smoke them, you could
soon burn up the dollar and hurt yourselves besides.Then, when you begin to have some idea how much six
hundred millions is, remember that six hundred million dollars are spent
in this country every year for tobacco--burned up--wasted--worse than
wasted.Do you think the farmer who planted tobacco instead of corn, did any
good to the world by the change?How does the liquor-drinker spend his money?What could we do, if no money was spent for
          liquor?Tell two ways in which you could burn up a
          dollar bill.How much money is spent for tobacco, yearly, in
          this country?*       *       *       *       *

Obvious punctuation errors repaired.Strachey
writes:

"He [Powhatan] was reported by the said Kemps, as also by the Indian
Machumps, who was sometyme in England, and comes to and fro amongst us
as he dares, and as Powhatan gives him leave, for it is not otherwise
safe for him, no more than it was for one Amarice, who had his braynes
knockt out for selling but a baskett of corne, and lying in the English
fort two or three days without Powhatan's leave; I say they often
reported unto us that Powhatan had then lyving twenty sonnes and ten
daughters, besyde a young one by Winganuske, Machumps his sister, and a
great darling of the King's; and besides, younge Pocohunta, a daughter
of his, using sometyme to our fort in tymes past, nowe married to a
private Captaine, called Kocoum, some two years since."Does Strachey intend to say that
Pocahontas was married to an Iniaan named Kocoum?She might have been
during the time after Smith's departure in 1609, and her kidnapping
in 1613, when she was of marriageable age.We shall see hereafter that
Powhatan, in 1614, said he had sold another favorite daughter of his,
whom Sir Thomas Dale desired, and who was not twelve years of age, to
be wife to a great chief.The term "private Captain" might perhaps be
applied to an Indian chief.Smith, in his "General Historie," says
the Indians have "but few occasions to use any officers more than one
commander, which commonly they call Werowance, or Caucorouse, which is
Captaine."It is probably not possible, with the best intentions, to
twist Kocoum into Caucorouse, or to suppose that Strachey intended to
say that a private captain was called in Indian a Kocoum.Werowance
and Caucorouse are not synonymous terms.Werowance means "chief," and
Caucorouse means "talker" or "orator," and is the original of our word
"caucus."Either Strachey was uninformed, or Pocahontas was married to an
Indian--a not violent presumption considering her age and the fact
that war between Powhatan and the whites for some time had cut off
intercourse between them--or Strachey referred to her marriage with
Rolfe, whom he calls by mistake Kocoum.If this is to be accepted,
then this paragraph must have been written in England in 1616, and have
referred to the marriage to Rolfe it "some two years since," in 1614.That Pocahontas was a gentle-hearted and pleasing girl, and, through her
acquaintance with Smith, friendly to the whites, there is no doubt; that
she was not different in her habits and mode of life from other Indian
girls, before the time of her kidnapping, there is every reason to
suppose.It was the English who magnified the imperialism of her father,
and exaggerated her own station as Princess.She certainly put on no
airs of royalty when she was "cart-wheeling" about the fort.Nor
does this detract anything from the native dignity of the mature, and
converted, and partially civilized woman.We should expect there would be the discrepancies which have been
noticed in the estimates of her age.Powhatan is not said to have kept
a private secretary to register births in his family.If Pocahontas gave
her age correctly, as it appears upon her London portrait in 1616,
aged twenty-one, she must have been eighteen years of age when she was
captured in 1613 This would make her about twelve at the time of Smith's
captivity in 1607-8.There is certainly room for difference of opinion
as to whether so precocious a woman, as her intelligent apprehension of
affairs shows her to have been, should have remained unmarried till the
age of eighteen.In marrying at least as early as that she would have
followed the custom of her tribe.It is possible that her intercourse
with the whites had raised her above such an alliance as would be
offered her at the court of Werowocomoco.We are without any record of the life of Pocahontas for some years.The occasional mentions of her name in the "General Historie" are so
evidently interpolated at a late date, that they do not aid us.When
and where she took the name of Matoaka, which appears upon her London
portrait, we are not told, nor when she was called Amonata, as Strachey
says she was "at more ripe yeares."How she was occupied from the
departure of Smith to her abduction, we can only guess.To follow her
authentic history we must take up the account of Captain Argall and of
Ralph Hamor, Jr., secretary of the colony under Governor Dale.Captain Argall, who seems to have been as bold as he was unscrupulous
in the execution of any plan intrusted to him, arrived in Virginia
in September, 1612, and early in the spring of 1613 he was sent on an
expedition up the Patowomek to trade for corn and to effect a capture
that would bring Powhatan to terms.The Emperor, from being a friend,
had become the most implacable enemy of the English.Captain Argall
says: "I was told by certain Indians, my friends, that the great
Powhatan's daughter Pokahuntis was with the great King Potowomek,
whither I presently repaired, resolved to possess myself of her by any
stratagem that I could use, for the ransoming of so many Englishmen as
were prisoners with Powhatan, as also to get such armes and tooles as
he and other Indians had got by murther and stealing some others of our
nation, with some quantity of corn for the colonies relief."By the aid of Japazeus, King of Pasptancy, an old acquaintance and
friend of Argall's, and the connivance of the King of Potowomek,
Pocahontas was enticed on board Argall's ship and secured.Word was sent
to Powhatan of the capture and the terms on which his daughter would be
released; namely, the return of the white men he held in slavery, the
tools and arms he had gotten and stolen, and a great quantity of corn.Powhatan, "much grieved," replied that if Argall would use his daughter
well, and bring the ship into his river and release her, he would accede
to all his demands.Therefore, on the 13th of April, Argall repaired to
Governor Gates at Jamestown, and delivered his prisoner, and a few days
after the King sent home some of the white captives, three pieces, one
broad-axe, a long whip-saw, and a canoe of corn.Pocahontas, however,
was kept at Jamestown.Why Pocahontas had left Werowocomoco and gone to stay with Patowomek
we can only conjecture.It is possible that Powhatan suspected her
friendliness to the whites, and was weary of her importunity, and it may
be that she wanted to escape the sight of continual fighting, ambushes,
and murders.More likely she was only making a common friendly visit,
though Hamor says she went to trade at an Indian fair.The story of her capture is enlarged and more minutely related by Ralph
Hamor, Jr., who was one of the colony shipwrecked on the Bermudas in
1609, and returned to England in 1614, where he published (London, 1615)
"A True Discourse of Virginia, and the Success of the Affairs there
till the 18th of June, 1614."Hamor was the son of a merchant tailor in
London who was a member of the Virginia company.Hamor writes:

"It chanced Powhatan's delight and darling, his daughter Pocahuntas
(whose fame has even been spread in England by the title of Nonparella
of Firginia) in her princely progresse if I may so terme it, tooke some
pleasure (in the absence of Captaine Argall) to be among her friends at
Pataomecke (as it seemeth by the relation I had), implored thither as
shopkeeper to a Fare, to exchange some of her father's commodities for
theirs, where residing some three months or longer, it fortuned upon
occasion either of promise or profit, Captaine Argall to arrive there,
whom Pocahuntas, desirous to renew her familiaritie with the English,
and delighting to see them as unknown, fearefull perhaps to be
surprised, would gladly visit as she did, of whom no sooner had Captaine
Argall intelligence, but he delt with an old friend Iapazeus, how and
by what meanes he might procure her caption, assuring him that now or
never, was the time to pleasure him, if he intended indeede that love
which he had made profession of, that in ransome of hir he might redeeme
some of our English men and armes, now in the possession of her father,
promising to use her withall faire and gentle entreaty; Iapazeus well
assured that his brother, as he promised, would use her courteously,
promised his best endeavors and service to accomplish his desire, and
thus wrought it, making his wife an instrument (which sex have ever been
most powerful in beguiling inticements) to effect his plot which hee
had thus laid, he agreed that himself, his wife and Pocahuntas, would
accompanie his brother to the water side, whither come, his wife should
faine a great and longing desire to goe aboorde, and see the shippe,
which being there three or four times before she had never seene, and
should be earnest with her husband to permit her--he seemed angry with
her, making as he pretended so unnecessary request, especially being
without the company of women, which denial she taking unkindly,
must faine to weepe (as who knows not that women can command teares)
whereupon her husband seeming to pitty those counterfeit teares, gave
her leave to goe aboord, so that it would pleese Pocahuntas to accompany
her; now was the greatest labour to win her, guilty perhaps of her
father's wrongs, though not knowne as she supposed, to goe with her, yet
by her earnest persuasions, she assented: so forthwith aboord they went,
the best cheere that could be made was seasonably provided, to supper
they went, merry on all hands, especially Iapazeus and his wife, who to
expres their joy would ere be treading upon Captaine Argall's foot, as
who should say tis don, she is your own.Supper ended Pocahuntas was
lodged in the gunner's roome, but Iapazeus and his wife desired to have
some conference with their brother, which was onely to acquaint him by
what stratagem they had betraied his prisoner as I have already
related: after which discourse to sleepe they went, Pocahuntas nothing
mistrusting this policy, who nevertheless being most possessed with
feere, and desire of returne, was first up, and hastened Iapazeus to be
gon.Argall having secretly well rewarded him, with a small Copper
kittle, and some other les valuable toies so highly by him esteemed,
that doubtlesse he would have betraied his own father for them,
permitted both him and his wife to returne, but told him that for divers
considerations, as for that his father had then eigh [8] of our Englishe
men, many swords, peeces, and other tooles, which he hid at severall
times by trecherous murdering our men, taken from them which though
of no use to him, he would not redeliver, he would reserve Pocahuntas,
whereat she began to be exceeding pensive, and discontented, yet
ignorant of the dealing of Japazeus who in outward appearance was no les
discontented that he should be the meanes of her captivity, much adoe
there was to pursuade her to be patient, which with extraordinary
curteous usage, by little and little was wrought in her, and so to
Jamestowne she was brought."Smith, who condenses this account in his "General Historie," expresses
his contempt of this Indian treachery by saying: "The old Jew and his
wife began to howle and crie as fast as Pocahuntas."It will be noted
that the account of the visit (apparently alone) of Pocahontas and her
capture is strong evidence that she was not at this time married to
"Kocoum" or anybody else.Word was despatched to Powhatan of his daughter's duress, with a
demand made for the restitution of goods; but although this savage is
represented as dearly loving Pocahontas, his "delight and darling," it
was, according to Hamor, three months before they heard anything from
him.His anxiety about his daughter could not have been intense.He
retained a part of his plunder, and a message was sent to him that
Pocahontas would be kept till he restored all the arms.This answer pleased Powhatan so little that they heard nothing from him
till the following March.Then Sir Thomas Dale and Captain Argall, with
several vessels and one hundred and fifty men, went up to Powhatan's
chief seat, taking his daughter with them, offering the Indians a chance
to fight for her or to take her in peace on surrender of the stolen
goods.The Indians received this with bravado and flights of arrows,
reminding them of the fate of Captain Ratcliffe.The whites landed,
killed some Indians, burnt forty houses, pillaged the village, and went
on up the river and came to anchor in front of Matchcot, the Emperor's
chief town.Here were assembled four hundred armed men, with bows and
arrows, who dared them to come ashore.Ashore they went, and a palaver
was held.The Indians wanted a day to consult their King, after which
they would fight, if nothing but blood would satisfy the whites.Two of Powhatan's sons who were present expressed a desire to see their
sister, who had been taken on shore.When they had sight of her, and
saw how well she was cared for, they greatly rejoiced and promised to
persuade their father to redeem her and conclude a lasting peace.The
two brothers were taken on board ship, and Master John Rolfe and Master
Sparkes were sent to negotiate with the King.Powhatan did not show
himself, but his brother Apachamo, his successor, promised to use his
best efforts to bring about a peace, and the expedition returned to
Jamestown."Long before this time," Hamor relates, "a gentleman of approved
behaviour and honest carriage, Master John Rolfe, had been in love with
Pocahuntas and she with him, which thing at the instant that we were
in parlee with them, myselfe made known to Sir Thomas Dale, by a letter
from him [Rolfe] whereby he entreated his advice and furtherance to his
love, if so it seemed fit to him for the good of the Plantation, and
Pocahuntas herself acquainted her brethren therewith."Governor Dale
approved this, and consequently was willing to retire without other
conditions."The bruite of this pretended marriage [Hamor continues]
came soon to Powhatan's knowledge, a thing acceptable to him, as
appeared by his sudden consent thereunto, who some ten daies after sent
an old uncle of hirs, named Opachisco, to give her as his deputy in the
church, and two of his sonnes to see the mariage solemnized which was
accordingly done about the fifth of April [1614], and ever since we have
had friendly commerce and trade, not only with Powhatan himself, but
also with his subjects round about us; so as now I see no reason why the
collonie should not thrive a pace."This marriage was justly celebrated as the means and beginning of a firm
peace which long continued, so that Pocahontas was again entitled to the
grateful remembrance of the Virginia settlers.Already, in 1612, a plan
had been mooted in Virginia of marrying the English with the natives,
and of obtaining the recognition of Powhatan and those allied to him as
members of a fifth kingdom, with certain privileges.Cunega, the Spanish
ambassador at London, on September 22, 1612, writes: "Although some
suppose the plantation to decrease, he is credibly informed that there
is a determination to marry some of the people that go over to Virginia;
forty or fifty are already so married, and English women intermingle and
are received kindly by the natives.A zealous minister hath been wounded
for reprehending it."John Rolfe was a man of industry, and apparently devoted to the
welfare of the colony.He probably brought with him in 1610 his wife,
who gave birth to his daughter Bermuda, born on the Somers Islands at
the time of the shipwreck.Hamor gives
him the distinction of being the first in the colony to try, in 1612,
the planting and raising of tobacco."No man [he adds] hath labored to
his power, by good example there and worthy encouragement into England
by his letters, than he hath done, witness his marriage with Powhatan's
daughter, one of rude education, manners barbarous and cursed
generation, meerely for the good and honor of the plantation: and
least any man should conceive that some sinister respects allured him
hereunto, I have made bold, contrary to his knowledge, in the end of my
treatise to insert the true coppie of his letter written to Sir Thomas
Dale."The letter is a long, labored, and curious document, and comes nearer to
a theological treatise than any love-letter we have on record.Why Rolfe did not speak to Dale, whom he saw every day,
instead of inflicting upon him this painful document, in which the
flutterings of a too susceptible widower's heart are hidden under a
great resolve of self-sacrifice, is not plain.The letter protests in a tedious preamble that the writer is moved
entirely by the Spirit of God, and continues:

"Let therefore this my well advised protestation, which here I make
between God and my own conscience, be a sufficient witness, at the
dreadful day of judgment (when the secrets of all men's hearts shall be
opened) to condemne me herein, if my chiefest interest and purpose be
not to strive with all my power of body and mind, in the undertaking
of so weighty a matter, no way led (so far forth as man's weakness may
permit) with the unbridled desire of carnall affection; but for the good
of this plantation, for the honour of our countrie, for the glory of
God, for my owne salvation, and for the converting to the true knowledge
of God and Jesus Christ, an unbelieving creature, namely Pokahuntas.To whom my heartie and best thoughts are, and have a long time bin so
entangled, and inthralled in so intricate a laborinth, that I was even
awearied to unwinde myself thereout."Master Rolfe goes on to describe the mighty war in his meditations on
this subject, in which he had set before his eyes the frailty of mankind
and his proneness to evil and wicked thoughts.He is aware of God's
displeasure against the sons of Levi and Israel for marrying strange
wives, and this has caused him to look about warily and with good
circumspection "into the grounds and principall agitations which should
thus provoke me to be in love with one, whose education hath bin rude,
her manners barbarous, her generation accursed, and so discrepant in
all nurtriture from myselfe, that oftentimes with feare and trembling,
I have ended my private controversie with this: surely these are
wicked instigations, fetched by him who seeketh and delighteth in man's
distruction; and so with fervent prayers to be ever preserved from such
diabolical assaults (as I looke those to be) I have taken some rest."The good man was desperately in love and wanted to marry the Indian, and
consequently he got no peace; and still being tormented with her image,
whether she was absent or present, he set out to produce an ingenious
reason (to show the world) for marrying her.He continues:

"Thus when I thought I had obtained my peace and quietnesse, beholde
another, but more gracious tentation hath made breaches into my holiest
and strongest meditations; with which I have been put to a new triall,
in a straighter manner than the former; for besides the weary passions
and sufferings which I have dailey, hourely, yea and in my sleepe
indured, even awaking me to astonishment, taxing me with remissnesse,
and carelessnesse, refusing and neglecting to perform the duteie of a
good Christian, pulling me by the eare, and crying: Why dost thou not
indeavor to make her a Christian?And these have happened to my greater
wonder, even when she hath been furthest seperated from me, which
in common reason (were it not an undoubted work of God) might breede
forgetfulnesse of a far more worthie creature."He accurately describes the symptoms and appears to understand the
remedy, but he is after a large-sized motive:

"Besides, I say the holy Spirit of God hath often demanded of me, why I
was created?If not for transitory pleasures and worldly vanities, but
to labour in the Lord's vineyard, there to sow and plant, to nourish and
increase the fruites thereof, daily adding with the good husband in the
gospell, somewhat to the tallent, that in the ends the fruites may be
reaped, to the comfort of the labourer in this life, and his salvation
in the world to come.... Likewise, adding hereunto her great appearance
of love to me, her desire to be taught and instructed in the knowledge
of God, her capablenesse of understanding, her aptness and willingness
to receive anie good impression, and also the spirituall, besides her
owne incitements stirring me up hereunto."The "incitements" gave him courage, so that he exclaims: "Shall I be of
so untoward a disposition, as to refuse to lead the blind into the right
way?Shall I be so unnatural, as not to give bread to the hungrie, or
uncharitable, as not to cover the naked?"It wasn't to be thought of, such wickedness; and so Master Rolfe screwed
up his courage to marry the glorious Princess, from whom thousands
of people were afterwards so anxious to be descended.But he made the
sacrifice for the glory of the country, the benefit of the plantation,
and the conversion of the unregenerate, and other and lower motive
he vigorously repels: "Now, if the vulgar sort, who square all men's
actions by the base rule of their own filthinesse, shall tax or taunt
mee in this my godly labour: let them know it is not hungry appetite, to
gorge myselfe with incontinency; sure (if I would and were so sensually
inclined) I might satisfy such desire, though not without a seared
conscience, yet with Christians more pleasing to the eie, and less
fearefull in the offense unlawfully committed.Nor am I in so desperate
an estate, that I regard not what becometh of me; nor am I out of hope
but one day to see my country, nor so void of friends, nor mean in
birth, but there to obtain a mach to my great con'tent.... But shall it
please God thus to dispose of me (which I earnestly desire to fulfill
my ends before set down) I will heartily accept of it as a godly taxe
appointed me, and I will never cease (God assisting me) untill I have
accomplished, and brought to perfection so holy a worke, in which I will
daily pray God to bless me, to mine and her eternal happiness."It is to be hoped that if sanctimonious John wrote any love-letters to
Amonata they had less cant in them than this.But it was pleasing to Sir
Thomas Dale, who was a man to appreciate the high motives of Mr.In a letter which he despatched from Jamestown, June 18, 1614, to a
reverend friend in London, he describes the expedition when Pocahontas
was carried up the river, and adds the information that when she went on
shore, "she would not talk to any of them, scarcely to them of the best
sort, and to them only, that if her father had loved her, he would not
value her less than old swords, pieces, or axes; wherefore she would
still dwell with the Englishmen who loved her.""Powhatan's daughter [the letter continues] I caused to be carefully
instructed in Christian Religion, who after she had made some good
progress therein, renounced publically her countrey idolatry, openly
confessed her Christian faith, was, as she desired, baptized, and is
since married to an English Gentleman of good understanding (as by his
letter unto me, containing the reasons for his marriage of her you may
perceive), an other knot to bind this peace the stronger.Her father
and friends gave approbation to it, and her uncle gave her to him in
the church; she lives civilly and lovingly with him, and I trust will
increase in goodness, as the knowledge of God increaseth in her.She
will goe into England with me, and were it but the gayning of this one
soule, I will think my time, toile, and present stay well spent."Hamor also appends to his narration a short letter, of the same date
with the above, from the minister Alexander Whittaker, the genuineness
of which is questioned.In speaking of the good deeds of Sir Thomas Dale
it says: "But that which is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa, the
daughter of Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreet English
Gentleman--Master Rolfe, and that after she had openly renounced her
countrey Idolatry, and confessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and was
baptized, which thing Sir Thomas Dale had laboured a long time to ground
her in."If, as this proclaims, she was married after her conversion,
then Rolfe's tender conscience must have given him another twist for
wedding her, when the reason for marrying her (her conversion) had
ceased with her baptism.His marriage, according to this, was a pure
work of supererogation.It took place about the 5th of April, 1614.It
is not known who performed the ceremony.How Pocahontas passed her time in Jamestown during the period of her
detention, we are not told.Conjectures are made that she was an inmate
of the house of Sir Thomas Dale, or of that of the Rev.Whittaker,
both of whom labored zealously to enlighten her mind on religious
subjects.She must also have been learning English and civilized ways,
for it is sure that she spoke our language very well when she went to
London.John Rolfe was also laboring for her conversion, and we may
suppose that with all these ministrations, mingled with her love of Mr.Rolfe, which that ingenious widower had discovered, and her desire to
convert him into a husband, she was not an unwilling captive.Whatever
may have been her barbarous instincts, we have the testimony of Governor
Dale that she lived "civilly and lovingly" with her husband.STORY OF POCAHONTAS, CONTINUED

Sir Thomas Dale was on the whole the most efficient and discreet
Governor the colony had had.One element of his success was no doubt the
change in the charter of 1609.By the first charter everything had
been held in common by the company, and there had been no division of
property or allotment of land among the colonists.Under the new regime
land was held in severalty, and the spur of individual interest began
at once to improve the condition of the settlement.The character of the
colonists was also gradually improving.They had not been of a sort
to fulfill the earnest desire of the London promoter's to spread vital
piety in the New World.A zealous defense of Virginia and Maryland,
against "scandalous imputation," entitled "Leah and Rachel; or, The
Two Fruitful Sisters," by Mr.John Hammond, London, 1656, considers
the charges that Virginia "is an unhealthy place, a nest of rogues,
abandoned women, dissolut and rookery persons; a place of intolerable
labour, bad usage and hard diet"; and admits that "at the first
settling, and for many years after, it deserved most of these
aspersions, nor were they then aspersions but truths.... There were
jails supplied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the provision
all brought out of England, and that embezzled by the Trustees."Governor Dale was a soldier; entering the army in the Netherlands as a
private he had risen to high position, and received knighthood in 1606.Shortly after he was with Sir Thomas Gates in South Holland.The States
General in 1611 granted him three years' term of absence in Virginia.Upon his arrival he began to put in force that system of industry and
frugality he had observed in Holland.He had all the imperiousness of a
soldier, and in an altercation with Captain Newport, occasioned by some
injurious remarks the latter made about Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer,
he pulled his beard and threatened to hang him.Active operations for
settling new plantations were at once begun, and Dale wrote to Cecil,
the Earl of Salisbury, for 2,000 good colonists to be sent out, for the
three hundred that came were "so profane, so riotous, so full of mutiny,
that not many are Christians but in name, their bodies so diseased and
crazed that not sixty of them may be employed."He served afterwards
with credit in Holland, was made commander of the East Indian fleet in
1618, had a naval engagement with the Dutch near Bantam in 1619, and
died in 1620 from the effects of the climate.He was twice married, and
his second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him
and received a patent for a Virginia plantation.Governor Dale kept steadily in view the conversion of the Indians to
Christianity, and the success of John Rolfe with Matoaka inspired
him with a desire to convert another daughter of Powhatan, of whose
exquisite perfections he had heard.He therefore despatched Ralph Hamor,
with the English boy, Thomas Savage, as interpreter, on a mission to
the court of Powhatan, "upon a message unto him, which was to deale with
him, if by any means I might procure a daughter of his, who (Pocahuntas
being already in our possession) is generally reported to be his delight
and darling, and surely he esteemed her as his owne Soule, for surer
pledge of peace."This visit Hamor relates with great naivete.At his town of Matchcot, near the head of York River, Powhatan
himself received his visitors when they landed, with great cordiality,
expressing much pleasure at seeing again the boy who had been presented
to him by Captain Newport, and whom he had not seen since he gave him
leave to go and see his friends at Jamestown four years before; he also
inquired anxiously after Namontack, whom he had sent to King James's
land to see him and his country and report thereon, and then led the way
to his house, where he sat down on his bedstead side."On each hand of
him was placed a comely and personable young woman, which they called
his Queenes, the howse within round about beset with them, the outside
guarded with a hundred bowmen."The first thing offered was a pipe of tobacco, which Powhatan "first
drank," and then passed to Hamor, who "drank" what he pleased and then
returned it.The Emperor then inquired how his brother Sir Thomas Dale
fared, "and after that of his daughter's welfare, her marriage, his
unknown son, and how they liked, lived and loved together."Hamor
replied "that his brother was very well, and his daughter so well
content that she would not change her life to return and live with him,
whereat he laughed heartily, and said he was very glad of it."Powhatan then desired to know the cause of his unexpected coming, and
Mr.Hamor said his message was private, to be delivered to him without
the presence of any except one of his councilors, and one of the guides,
who already knew it.Therefore the house was cleared of all except the two Queens, who may
never sequester themselves, and Mr.First there
was a message of love and inviolable peace, the production of presents
of coffee, beads, combs, fish-hooks, and knives, and the promise of
a grindstone when it pleased the Emperor to send for it.Hamor then
proceeded:

"The bruite of the exquesite perfection of your youngest daughter, being
famous through all your territories, hath come to the hearing of your
brother, Sir Thomas Dale, who for this purpose hath addressed me hither,
to intreate you by that brotherly friendship you make profession of, to
permit her (with me) to returne unto him, partly for the desire which
himselfe hath, and partly for the desire her sister hath to see her of
whom, if fame hath not been prodigall, as like enough it hath not, your
brother (by your favour) would gladly make his nearest companion, wife
and bed fellow [many times he would have interrupted my speech, which
I entreated him to heare out, and then if he pleased to returne me
answer], and the reason hereof is, because being now friendly and firmly
united together, and made one people [as he supposeth and believes] in
the bond of love, he would make a natural union between us, principally
because himself hath taken resolution to dwel in your country so long as
he liveth, and would not only therefore have the firmest assurance hee
may, of perpetuall friendship from you, but also hereby binde himselfe
thereunto."Powhatan replied with dignity that he gladly accepted the salute of love
and peace, which he and his subjects would exactly maintain.But as to
the other matter he said: "My daughter, whom my brother desireth, I sold
within these three days to be wife to a great Weroance for two bushels
of Roanoke [a small kind of beads made of oyster shells], and it is true
she is already gone with him, three days' journey from me."Hamor persisted that this marriage need not stand in the way; "that if
he pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might, restoring the Roanoke
without the imputation of injustice, take home his daughter again, the
rather because she was not full twelve years old, and therefore not
marriageable; assuring him besides the bond of peace, so much the
firmer, he should have treble the price of his daughter in beads,
copper, hatchets, and many other things more useful for him."The reply of the noble old savage to this infamous demand ought to have
brought a blush to the cheeks of those who made it.He said he loved his
daughter as dearly as his life; he had many children, but he delighted
in none so much as in her; he could not live if he did not see her
often, as he would not if she were living with the whites, and he
was determined not to put himself in their hands.He desired no other
assurance of friendship than his brother had given him, who had already
one of his daughters as a pledge, which was sufficient while she lived;
"when she dieth he shall have another child of mine."And then he broke
forth in pathetic eloquence: "I hold it not a brotherly part of your
King, to desire to bereave me of two of my children at once; further
give him to understand, that if he had no pledge at all, he should not
need to distrust any injury from me, or any under my subjection; there
have been too many of his and my men killed, and by my occasion there
shall never be more; I which have power to perform it have said it; no
not though I should have just occasion offered, for I am now old and
would gladly end my days in peace; so as if the English offer me any
injury, my country is large enough, I will remove myself farther from
you."The old man hospitably entertained his guests for a day or two, loaded
them with presents, among which were two dressed buckskins, white as
snow, for his son and daughter, and, requesting some articles sent him
in return, bade them farewell with this message to Governor Dale: "I
hope this will give him good satisfaction, if it do not I will go three
days' journey farther from him, and never see Englishmen more."It
speaks well for the temperate habits of this savage that after he had
feasted his guests, "he caused to be fetched a great glass of sack, some
three quarts or better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven
years since, carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all
this time spent, and gave each of us in a great oyster shell some three
spoonfuls."We trust that Sir Thomas Dale gave a faithful account of all this to his
wife in England.Sir Thomas Gates left Virginia in the spring of 1614 and never returned.After his departure scarcity and severity developed a mutiny, and six
of the settlers were executed.Rolfe was planting tobacco (he has the
credit of being the first white planter of it), and his wife was getting
an inside view of Christian civilization.In 1616 Sir Thomas Dale returned to England with his company and John
Rolfe and Pocahontas, and several other Indians.They reached Plymouth
early in June, and on the 20th Lord Carew made this note: "Sir Thomas
Dale returned from Virginia; he hath brought divers men and women of
thatt countrye to be educated here, and one Rolfe who married a daughter
of Pohetan (the barbarous prince) called Pocahuntas, hath brought his
wife with him into England."On the 22d Sir John Chamberlain wrote to
Sir Dudley Carlton that there were "ten or twelve, old and young, of
that country."The Indian girls who came with Pocahontas appear to have been a great
care to the London company.In May, 1620, is a record that the company
had to pay for physic and cordials for one of them who had been living
as a servant in Cheapside, and was very weak of a consumption.The same
year two other of the maids were shipped off to the Bermudas, after
being long a charge to the company, in the hope that they might there
get husbands, "that after they were converted and had children, they
might be sent to their country and kindred to civilize them."The attempt to educate them in England was not
very successful, and a proposal to bring over Indian boys obtained this
comment from Sir Edwin Sandys:

"Now to send for them into England, and to have them educated here, he
found upon experience of those brought by Sir Thomas Dale, might be far
from the Christian work intended."One Nanamack, a lad brought over by
Lord Delaware, lived some years in houses where "he heard not much of
religion but sins, had many times examples of drinking, swearing and
like evils, ran as he was a mere Pagan," till he fell in with a
devout family and changed his life, but died before he was baptized.Accompanying Pocahontas was a councilor of Powhatan, one Tomocomo, the
husband of one of her sisters, of whom Purchas says in his "Pilgrimes":
"With this savage I have often conversed with my good friend Master
Doctor Goldstone where he was a frequent geust, and where I have seen
him sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of
his country and religion.... Master Rolfe lent me a discourse which
I have in my Pilgrimage delivered.And his wife did not only accustom
herself to civility, but still carried herself as the daughter of a
king, and was accordingly respected, not only by the Company which
allowed provision for herself and her son, but of divers particular
persons of honor, in their hopeful zeal by her to advance Christianity.I was present when my honorable and reverend patron, the Lord Bishop of
London, Doctor King, entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond
what I had seen in his great hospitality offered to other ladies.At
her return towards Virginia she came at Gravesend to her end and grave,
having given great demonstration of her Christian sincerity, as the
first fruits of Virginia conversion, leaving here a goodly memory,
and the hopes of her resurrection, her soul aspiring to see and enjoy
permanently in heaven what here she had joyed to hear and believe of her
blessed Saviour.Not such was Tomocomo, but a blasphemer of what he knew
not and preferring his God to ours because he taught them (by his own
so appearing) to wear their Devil-lock at the left ear; he acquainted me
with the manner of that his appearance, and believed that their Okee or
Devil had taught them their husbandry."Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own
importance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or
"little booke" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is
found in Smith's "General Historie" ( 1624), where it is introduced
as having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of
it.Whether the "abstract" in the "General Historie" is exactly like
the original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in
Smith's memory than we have in his dates.The letter is as follows:

"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine."The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me
in the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee
presume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short
discourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,
I must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee
thankful."That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the
power of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage
exceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the
most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and
his sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,
being but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose
compassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause
to respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim
attendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I
cannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of
those my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After
some six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of
my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save
mine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was
safely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty
miserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those
large territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore
Commonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved."And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by
this Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant
Fortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not
spare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,
and our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to
imploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or
her extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am
sure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought
to surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not
affright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered
eies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:
which had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild
traine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during
the time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the
instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter
confusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia
might have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since
then, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents
from that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and
troublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our
Colonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,
the Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last
rejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,
with whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of
that Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe
in mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly
considered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding."Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your
best leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done
in the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented
you from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet
I never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of
abilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,
her birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly
to beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be
from one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's
estate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most
and least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried
it as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her
station: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome
may rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and
Christianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all
this good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should
doe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to
your servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare
her dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest
subjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious
hands."The passage in this letter, "She hazarded the beating out of her owne
braines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the
paragraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;
and Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up
his

"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the
first three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to
New England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the
service she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect
of the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there
Smith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only
one we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she
had supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He
writes:

"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured
her face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband
with divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself
to have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to
talke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You
did promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to
you; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the
same reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I
durst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With
a well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my
father's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and
fear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and
you shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your
contrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other
till I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek
you, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by
Powhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they
and their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make
notches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that
task.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him
to show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had
told so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had
heard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably
not coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was
convinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave
Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave
me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they
did think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen
many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and
he heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,
as also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both
at the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but
the contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of
curiosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,
and the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's "Christmas his Mask" at court, January
6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain
writes to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father
counsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and
her assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though
sore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England
she does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter
writers," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that
Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he
had not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian
princesse."His interest in the colony was never
the most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of
the Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The
King very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was
sure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that
you know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a
portrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is
translated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,
Emperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died
on shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved
by Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the
London edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that
the portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The
portrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:

Round the portrait:

"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:

         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"
Below:

"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of
Attanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian
faith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this
young lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have
sufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her
own country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the
English; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,
of her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at
Gravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably
on the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which
I cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,
where she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of
that church has this record:


       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe
        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent
     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried
          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State
Papers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March
21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became
Governor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that
unscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the
company.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot
imagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives
have given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it
from all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some
do here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for
yourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that
Lady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands
in Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and
Mr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had
come into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him."This George
Sandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish
Empire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book
written in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's
"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his
marriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his
brother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be
converted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own
indemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas
to the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil
practices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle
Henry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned
to Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his
application to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the
Indian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only
daughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by
whom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father
to the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to
Col.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.[Footnote 526: But do you --Ver.He is pretending to be very
anxious for her comfort, and is begging the person on the other side not
to squeeze so close against his mistress.][Footnote 527: And you as well.--Ver.As in the theatres, the
seats, which were called 'gradas,''sedilia,' or'subsellia,' were
arranged round the course of the Circus, in ascending tiers; the lowest
being, very probably, almost flush with the ground.There were, perhaps,
no backs to the seats, or, at the best, only a slight railing of wood.The knees consequently of those in the back row would be level, and in
juxta-position with the backs of those in front.He is here telling the
person who is sitting behind, to be good enough to keep his knees to
himself, and not to hurt the lady's back by pressing against her.][Footnote 528: I am taking it up.--Ver.He is here showing off his
politeness, and will not give her the trouble of gathering up her dress.Even in those days, the ladies seem to have had no objection to their
dresses doing the work of the scavenger's broom.][Footnote 529: The fleet Atalanta.--Ver.Some suppose that the
Arcadian Atalanta, the daughter of Iasius, was beloved by a youth of the
name of Milanion.According to Apollodorus, who evidently confounds
the Arcadian with the Boeotian Atalanta, Milanion was another name of
Hippo-menes, who conquered the latter in the foot race, as mentioned
in the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses.See the Translation of the
Metamorphoses, p.From this and another passage of Ovid, we have
reason to suppose that Atalanta was, by tradition, famous for the beauty
of her ancles.][Footnote 530: The fan may cause.--Ver.Instead of the word
'tabella,' 'flabella' has been suggested here; but as the first syllable
is long, such a reading would occasion a violation of the laws of metre,
and 'tabella' is probably correct.It has, however, the same meaning
here as 'flabella it signifying what we should call 'a fan;' in fact,
the 'flabellum' was a 'tabella,' or thin board, edged with peacocks'
feathers, or those of other birds, and sometimes with variegated pieces
of cloth.These were generally waved by female slaves, who were called
'flabelliferæ'; or else by eunuchs or young boys.They were used to cool
the atmosphere, to drive away gnats and flies, and to promote sleep.We here see a gentleman offering to fan a lady, as a compliment; and it
must have been especially grateful amid the dust and heat of the Roman
Circus.That which was especially intended for the purpose of driving
away flies, was called'muscarium.'The use of fans was not confined
to females; as we learn from Suetonius, that the Emperor Augustus had
a slave to fan him during his sleep.The fan was also sometimes made of
linen, extended upon a light frame, and sometimes of the two wings of a
bird, joined back to back, and attached to a handle.][Footnote 531: Now the procession.--Ver.34 All this time they have
been waiting for the ceremony to commence.The 'Pompa,' or procession,
now opens the performance.In this all those who were about to exhibit
in the race took a part.The statues of the Gods were borne on wooden
platforms on the shoulders of men, or on wheels, according as they
were light or heavy.The procession moved from the Capitol, through the
Forum, to the Circus Maximus, and was also attended by the officers of
state.Musicians and dancers preceded the statues of the Gods.[Footnote 532: Victory borne.--Ver.On the wooden platform, which
was called 'ferculum,' or 'thensa,' according as it was small or large.][Footnote 533: With expanded wings.--Ver.Victory was always
represented with expanded wings, on account of her inconstancy and
volatility.][Footnote 534: Salute Neptune.--Ver.'Plaudite Neptuno' is
equivalent, in our common parlance, to 'Give a cheer for Neptune.'He
is addressing the sailors who may be present: but he declines to have
anything to do with the sea himself.][Footnote 535: Arms I detest.--Ver.Like his contemporary, Horace,
Ovid was no lover of war.][Footnote 536: Of the artisan.--Ver.We learn from the Fasti, Book
iii.1.815, that Minerva was especially venerated as the patroness of
handicrafts.][Footnote 537: Let the boxers.--Ver.Boxing was one of the earliest
athletic games practised by the Greeks.Apollo and Hercules, as well as
Pollux, are celebrated by the poets for excelling in this exercise.It formed a portion of the Olympic contests; while boys fought in the
Nemean and Isthmian games.Concerning the 'cæstus' used by pugilists,
see the Fasti, Book ii.The method
in fighting most practised was to remain on the defensive, and thus to
wear out the opponent by continual efforts.To inflict blows, without
receiving any in return on the body, was the great point of merit.The
right arm was chiefly used for attack, while the office of the left was
to protect the body.Teeth were often knocked out, and the ears were
much disfigured.The boxers, by the rules of the game, were not allowed
to take hold of each other, nor to trip up their antagonist.In Italy
boxing seems to have been practised from early times by the people of
Etruria.It continued to be one of the popular games during the period
of the Republic as well as of the Empire.][Footnote 538: In the lattice work.--Ver.The 'cancelli' were
lattice work, which probably fkirted the outer edge of each wide
'præcinctio,' or passage,that ran along in front of the seats, at
certain intervals.As the knees would not there be so cramped, these
seats would be considered the most desirable.It is clear that Ovid and
the lady have had the good fortune to secure front seats, with the feet
resting either on the lowest 'præcinctio', or the 'præcinctio' of a set
of seats higher up.Stools, of course, could not be used, as they would
be in the way of passers-by.He perceives, as the seat is high, that she
has some difficulty in touching the ground with her feet, and naturally
concludes that her legs must ache; on which he tells her, if it will
give her ease, to rest the tips of her feet on the lattice work railing
which was opposite, and which, if they were on an upper 'præcinctio,'
ran along the edge of it: or if they were on the very lowest tier,
skirted the edge of the 'podium' which formed the basis of that tier.This she might do, if the 'præcinctio' was not more than a yard wide,
and if the 'cancelli' were as much as a foot in height.][Footnote 539: Now the Prcetor.--Ver.The course is now clear
of the procession, and the Prætor gives the signal for the start, the
'carceres' being first opened.This was sometimes given by sound of
trumpet, or more frequently by letting fall a napkin; at least, after
the time of Nero, who is said, on one occasion, while taking a meal, to
have heard the shouts of the people who were impatient for the race to
begin, on which he threw down his napkin as the signal.][Footnote 540: The even harriers.--Ver.From this description we
should be apt to think that the start was effected at the instant when
the 'carceres' were opened.This was not the case: for after coming out
of the-carceres,' the chariots were ranged abreast before a white line,
which was held by men whose office it was to do, and who were called
'moratores.'When all were ready, and the signal had been given, the
white line was thrown down, and the race commenced, which was seven
times round the course.The 'career' is called 'æquum,' because they
were in a straight line, and each chariot was ranged in front of the
door of its 'career.'][Footnote 541: Circuit far too wide.--Ver.The charioteer, whom the
lady favours, is going too wide of the'meta,' or turning-place, and so
loses ground, while the next overtakes him.][Footnote 542: To the left.--Ver.He tells him to guide the horses
to the left, so as to keep closer to the'meta,' and not to lose so much
ground by going wide of it.][Footnote 543: Call him back again.--Ver.He, by accident, lets
drop the observation, that they have been interesting themselves for
a blockhead.But he immediately checks himself, and, anxious that the
favourite may yet distinguish himself, trusts that the spectators
will call him back.Crispinus, the Delphin Editor, thinks, that by the
calling back, it is meant that it was a false start, and that the race
was to be run over again.Bur-mann, however, is not of that opinion;
but supposes, that if any chariot did not go well, or the horses seemed
jaded, it was the custom to call the driver back from the present race,
that with new horses he might join in the next race.This, from the
sequel, seems the most rational mode of explanation here.][Footnote 544: Waving the garments.--Ver.The signal for stopping
was given by the men rising and shaking and waving their outer garments,
or 'togae,' and probably calling the charioteer by name.][Footnote 545: Disarrange your hair.--Ver.He is afraid lest her
neighbours, in their vehemence should discommode her hair, and tells
her, in joke, that she may creep into the bosom of his own 'toga.'][Footnote 546: And now the barrier.--Ver.The first race we are to
suppose finished, and the second begins similarly to the first.There
were generally twenty-five of these'missus,' or races in a day.][Footnote 547: The variegated throng.--Ver.[Footnote 548: At all events.--Ver.He addresses the favourite, who
has again started in this race.][Footnote 549: Bears away the palm.--Ver.The favourite charioteer
is now victorious, and the Poet hopes that he himself may gain the palm
in like manner.The victor descended from his car at the end of the
race, and ascended the'spina,' where he received his reward, which was
generally a considerable sum of money.For an account of the'spina,'
see the Metamorphoses, Book x. l.[Footnote 550: Her beauty remains.--Ver.She has not been punished
with ugliness, as a judgment for her treachery.][Footnote 551: Proved false to me.--Ver.Tibullus has a similar
passage, 'Et si perque suos fallax juravit ocellos 'and if with her eyes
the deceitful damsel is forsworn.'][Footnote 552: Its divine sway.--Ver.'Numen' here means a power
equal to that of the Divinities, and which puts it on a level with
them.][Footnote 553: Mine felt pain.--Ver.When the damsel swore by them,
his eyes smarted, as though conscious of her perjury.][Footnote 554: Forsooth to you.--Ver.He says that surely it was
enough for the Gods to punish Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus, for
the sins of her mother, without making him to suffer misery for the
perjury of his mistress.Cassiope, the mother of Andromeda, having dared
to compare her own beauty with that of the Nereids, her daughter was, by
the command of Jupiter, exposed to a sea-monster, which was afterwards
slain by Perseus.[Footnote 555: Hurls at the groves.--Ver.A place which had been
struck by lightning was called 'bidental,' and was held sacred ever
afterwards.The same veneration was also paid to a place where any
person who had been killed by lightning was buried.Priests collected
the earth that had been torn up by lightning, and everything that had
been scorched, and buried it in the ground with lamentations.The spot
was then consecrated by sacrificing a two-year-old sheep, which being
called 'bidens,' gave its name to the place.An altar was also erected
there, and it was not allowable thenceforth to tread on the spot, or
to touch it, or even look at it.When the altar had fallen to decay, it
might be renovated, but to remove its boundaries was deemed sacrilege.Madness was supposed to ensue on committing such an offence; and Seneca
mentions a belief, that wine which had been struck by lightning, would
produce death or madness in those who drank it.][Footnote 556: Unfortunate Semele.--Ver.See the fate of Semele,
related in the Third Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 557: Have some regard.--Ver.'Don't
sweat any more by my eyes.'][Footnote 558: Because she cannot, stilt sews.--Ver.It is not a
little singular that a heathen poet should enunciate the moral doctrine
of the New Testament, that it is the thought, and not the action, that
of necessity constitutes the sin.][Footnote 559: A hundred in his neck.--Ver.In the First Book of
the Metamorphoses, he assigns to Argus only one hundred eyes; here,
however, he uses a poet's license, prohably for the sake of filling up
the line.][Footnote 560: Its stone and its iron.--Ver.From Pausanias and
Lucian we learn that the chamber of Danaë was under ground, and was
lined with copper and iron.][Footnote 561: Nor yet is it legal.--Ver.He tells him that he
ought not to inflict loss of liberty on a free-born woman, a punishment
that was only suited to a slave.][Footnote 562: Those two qualities.--Ver.He says, the wish being
probably the father to the thought, that beauty and chastity cannot
possibly exist together.][Footnote 563: Many a thing at home.--Ver.He tells him that he
will grow quite rich with the presents which his wife will then receive
from her admirers.][Footnote 564: Its bubbling foam..--Ver.He alludes to the noise
which the milk makes at the moment when it touches that in the pail.][Footnote 565: Ewe when milked.--Ver.Probably the milk of ewes was
used for making cheese, as is sometimes the case in this country.][Footnote 566: Hag of a procuress.--Ver.We have been already
introduced to one amiable specimen of this class in the Eighth Elegy of
the First Book.][Footnote 567: River that hast.--Ver.Ciofanus has this interesting
Note:--'This river is that which flows near the walls of Sulmo, and,
which, at the present day we call 'Vella.'In the early spring, when the
snows melt, and sometimes, at the beginning of autumn, it swells to a
wonderful degree with the rains, so that it becomes quite impassable.Ovid lived not far from the Fountain of Love, at the foot of the
Moronian hill, and had a house there, of which considerable vestiges
still remain, and are called 'la botteghe d'Ovidio.'Wishing to go
thence to the town of Sulmo, where his mistress was living, this river
was an obstruction to his passage.'][Footnote 568: A hollow boat.--Ver.'Cymba' was a name given to
small boats used on rivers or lakes.He here alludes to a ferry-boat,
which was not rowed over; but a chain or rope extending from one side of
the stream to the other, the boatman passed across by running his hands
along the rope.][Footnote 569: The opposite mountain.--Ver.The mountain of Soracte
was near the Flaminian way, in the territory of the Falisci, and may
possibly be the one here alluded to.Ciofanus says that its name is now
'Majella,-and that it is equal in height to the loftiest mountains of
Italy, and capped with eternal snow.He means to say that he has risen early in the morning for the purpose
of proceeding on his journey.][Footnote 570: The son of Danaë.--Ver.Mercury was said to have
lent to Perseus his winged shoes, 'talaria,' when he slew Medusa with
her viperous locks.][Footnote 571: Wish for the chariot.--Ver.Ceres was said to have
sent Trip-tolemus in her chariot, drawn by winged dragons, to introduce
agriculture among mankind.See the Fourth Book of the Fasti, 1.[Footnote 572: Inachus.--Ver.Inachus was a river of Argolis, in
Peloponnesus.][Footnote 573: Love for Melie.--Ver.Melie was a Nymph beloved by
Neptune, to whom she bore Amycus, king of Bebrycia, or Bithynia, in Asia
Minor, whence her present appellation.][Footnote 574: Alpheus.--Ver 29.See the story of Alpheus and Arethusa,
in the Fifth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 575: Creüsa.--Ver.Creüsa was a Naïad, the mother of
Hypseas, king of the Lapithae, by Peneus, a river of Thessaly.Xanthus
was a rivulet near Troy.Of Creüsa being promised to Xanthus nothing
whatever is known.][Footnote 576: The be beloved by Mars.--Ver.Pindar, in his Sixth
Olympic Ode, says that Metope, the daughter of Ladon, was the mother of
live daughters, by Asopus, a river of Boeotia.Their names were Corcyra,
Ægina, Salamis, Thebe, and Harpinna.Ovid, in calling her Thebe,
probably follows some other writer.She is called 'Martia,' because she
was beloved by Mars, to whom she bore Evadne.][Footnote 577: Hand of Hercules.--Ver.For the contest of Hercules
and Achelous for the hand of Deianira, see the beginning of the Ninth
Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 578: Calydon.--Ver.Aeneus, the father of Meleager and
Dei'anira, reigned over Ætolia, of which Calydon was the chief city.][Footnote 579: The native spot.--Ver.40; He alludes to the fact of the
source or native country of the Nile being then, as it probably still
is, quite unknown.][Footnote 580: Daughter of Asopus.--Ver.Evadne is called
'Asopide,' from her mother being the wife of Asopus.[Footnote 581: Enipeus dried up.--Ver.Probably the true reading
here is 'fictus,' 'the false Enipeus.'Tyro was the daughter of
Salmoneus, king of Pisa, in Elis.She being much enamoured of the river
Enipeus, Neptune is said to have assumed his form, and to have been, by
her, the father of Pelias and Neleus.'][Footnote 582: Argive Tibur,--Ver.Tibur was a town beautifully
situate in the neighbourhood of Home; it was said to have been founded
by three Argive brothers, Tyburtus, Catillus, and Coras.][Footnote 583: Whom Ilia.--Ver.Ilia was said to have been buried
alive, by the orders of Amulius, on the banks of the river Tiber; or,
according to some, to have been thrown into that river, on which she is
said to have become the wife of the river, and was deified.Acron, an
ancient historian, wrote to the effect that her ashes were interred on
the banks of the Anio; and that river overflowing, carried them to
the bed of the Tiber, whence arose the story of her nuptials with the
latter.According to one account, she was not put to death, but was
imprisoned, having been spared by Amulius at the entreaty of his
daughter, who was of the same age as herself, and at length regained her
liberty.][Footnote 584: Descendant of Laomedon.--Ver.She was supposed to
be descended from Laomedon, through Ascanius, the son of Creüsa, the
granddaughter of Laomedon.][Footnote 585: No white fillet.--Ver.The fillet with which the
Vestals bound their hair.][Footnote 586: Am I courted.--Ver.The Vestais were released from
their duties, and were allowed to marry if they chose, after they had
served for thirty years.The first ten years were passed in learning
their duties, the next ten in performing them, and the last ten in
instructing the novices.][Footnote 587: Did she throw herself.--Ver.The Poet follows the
account which represented her as drowning herself.][Footnote 588: To some fixed rule.--Ver.'Legitimum' means
'according to fixed laws so that it might be depended upon, 'in a steady
manner.'][Footnote 589: Injurious to the flocks.--Ver.It would be
'damnosus' in many ways, especially from its sweeping away the cattle
and the produce of the land.Its waters, too, being turbid, would be
unpalatable to the thirsty traveller, and unwholesome from the melted
snow, which would be likely to produce goitre, or swellings in the
throat.][Footnote 590: Could I speak of the rivers.--Ver.He apologizes to
the Acheloüs, Inachus, and Nile, for presuming to mention their names,
in addressing such a turbid, contemptible stream.][Footnote 591: After my poems.--Ver.He refers to his lighter works;
such, perhaps, as the previous books of his Amores.This explains
the nature of the 'libelli,' which he refers to in his address to his
mistress, in the Second Book of the Amores, El.[Footnote 592: His wealth acquired.--Ver.For the
explanation of this word, see the Fasti, B. i.217, and the Note to
the passage.][Footnote 593: Through his wounds.--Ver.In battle, either by giving
wounds, or receiving them.][Footnote 594: Which thus late.--Ver.By 4 serum,'he means that
his position, as a man of respectable station, has only been recently
acquired, and has not descended to him through a long line of
ancestors.][Footnote 595: Was it acquired.--Ver.This was really much to
the merit of his rival; but most of the higher classes of the Romans
affected to despise anything like gain by means of bodily exertion; and
the Poet has extended this feeling even to the rewards of merit as a
soldier.][Footnote 596: Hold sway over.--Ver.He here plays upon the two
meanings of the word 'deducere.''Deducere carmen' is 'to compose
poetry'; 'deducere primum pilum' means 'to form' or 'command the first
troop of the Triarii.'These were the veteran soldiers of the Roman
army, and the 'Primipilus' (which office is here alluded to) being the
first Centurion of the first maniple of them, was the chief Centurion of
the legion, holding an office somewhat similar to our senior captains.See the Note to the
49th line of the Seventh Epistle, in the-Fourth Book of the Pontic
Epistles.][Footnote 597: The ravished damsel.--Ver.[Footnote 598: Resorted to presents.--Ver.He seems to allude to
the real meaning of the story of Danaë, which, no doubt, had reference
to the corrupting influence of money.][Footnote 599: With no boundaries.--Ver.The 'limes' was a line
or boundary, between pieces of land belonging to different persons, and
consisted of a path, or ditch, or a row of stones.The 'ager limitatus'
was the public land marked out by 'limites,' for the purposes of
allotment to the citizens.On apportioning the land, a line, which was
called 'limes,' was drawn through a given point from East to West, which
was called 'decumanus,' and another line was drawn from North to South.The distance at which the 'limites' were to be drawn depended on the
magnitude of the squares or 'centuriæ,' as they were called, into which
it was purposed to divide the tract.][Footnote 601: Then was the shore.--Ver.Because they had not as
yet learnt the art of navigation.][Footnote 602: Turreted fortifications.--Ver.Among the ancients
the fortifications of cities were strengthened by towers, which were
placed at intervals on the walls; they were also generally used at the
gates of towns.][Footnote 603: Why not seek the heavens.--Ver.With what indignation
would he not have spoken of a balloon, as being nothing less than a
downright attempt to scale the 'tertia régna!'][Footnote 604: Ciesar but recently.--Ver.See the end of the
Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, and the Fasti, Book iii.[Footnote 605: The Senate-house.--Ver.'Curia'was the name of the
place where the Senate held its meetings, such as the 'curia Hostilia,'
* Julia,' Marcelli,' and others.Hence arose the custom of calling the
Senate itself, in the various Roman towns, by the name of 'curia,' but
not the Senate of Rome.He here means to say, that poverty excluded a
man from the Senate-house, and that wealth alone was the qualification
for the honours of the state.][Footnote 606: Wealth alone confers honours --Ver.The same
expression occurs in the Fasti, Book i.'217, where a similar
complaint is made on the worldly-mindedness of the age.][Footnote 607: The Field of Mars.--Ver.The 'comitia,' or meetings
for the elections of the magistrates, were held on the 'Campus Martius'
or field of Mars.See the Notes to the Fasti, Book i.The 'Fora' were of two kinds
at Rome; some being market-places, where all kinds of goods were exposed
for sale, while others were solely courts of justice.Among the latter
is the one here mentioned, which was simply called 'Forum,' so long as
it was the only one of its kind existing at Rome, and, indeed, after
that period, as in the present instance.At a later period of the
Republic, and under the Empire, when other 'fora,' for judicial
purposes, were erected, this Forum' was distinguished by the epithets
'vetus,' 'old,' or'magnum, 'great.'It was situate between the
Capitoline and Palatine hills, and was originally a swamp or marsh,
which was filled up hy Romulus or Tatius.It was chiefly used for
judicial proceedings, and is supposed to have been surrounded with
the hankers' shops or offices, 'argentaria.'Gladiatorial games were
occasionally held there, and sometimes prisoners of war, and faithless
legionary soldiers, were there put to death.A second 'Forum,' for
judicial purposes, was erected hy Julius Caesar, and was called hy his
name.It was adorned with a splendid temple of Venus Genitrix.A third
was built hy Augustus, and was called 'Forum Augusts' It was adorned
with a temple of Mars, and the statues of the most distinguished men
of the republic.Having suffered severely from fire, this Forum was
restored by the Emperor Hadrian.It is mentioned in the Fourth Book of
the Pontic Epistles, Ep.[Footnote 609: With regard to me.--Ver.He says that because he is
poor she makes excuses, and pretends that she is afraid of her husband
and those whom he has set to watch her.][Footnote 610: Of thy own inspiration.--Ver.Burmann remarks, that
the word 'opus' is especially applied to the sacred rites of the Gods;
literally 'the priest of thy rites.'][Footnote 611: The erected pile--Ver.Among the Romans the corpse
was burnt on a pile of wood, which was called 'pyra,' or 'rogus.'According to Servius, it was called by the former name before, and hy
the latter after, it was lighted, but this distinction is not observed
by the Latin writers.]It was in the form of an altar with four equal sides, but it varied in
height and the mode of decoration, according to the circumstances of the
deceased.On the pile the body was placed with the couch on which it had
been carried; and frankincense, ointments, locks of hair, and garlands,
were thrown upon it.Even ornaments, clothes, and dishes of food were
sometimes used for the same purpose.This was done not only by the
family of the deceased, but by such persons as joined the funeral
procession.][Footnote 612: The cruel boar.--Ver.He alludes to the death of
Adonis, by the tusk of a boar, which pierced his thigh.See the Tenth
Book of the Metamorphoses, l.[Footnote 613: We possess inspiration.--Ver.In the Sixth Book of
the Fasti, 1.'There is a Deity within us (Poets): under
his guidance we glow with inspiration; this poetic fervour contains the
impregnating.particles of the mind of the Divinity.'][Footnote 614: She lays her.--Ver.It must be remembered that,
whereas we personify Death as of the masculine gender; the Romans
represented the grim tyrant as being a female.It is a curious fact
that we find Death very rarely represented as a skeleton on the Roman
monuments.The skeleton of a child has, in one instance, been found
represented on one of the tombs of Pompeii.The head of a horse was
one of the most common modes of representing death, as it signified
departure.][Footnote 615: Ismarian Orpheus.--Ver.Apollo and the Muse Calliope
were the parents of Orpheus, who met with a cruel death.See the
beginning of the Eleventh Book of the Metamorphoses.]'Ælinon' was said to have been
the exclamation of Apollo, on the death of his son, the poet Linus.The
word is derived from the Greek, 'di Aivôç,' 'Alas!A certain
poetic measure was called by this name; but we learn from Athenaeus,
that it was not always confined to pathetic subjects.There appear to
have been two persons of the name of Linus.One was a Theban, the son of
Apollo, and the instructor of Orpheus and Hercules, while the other was
the son of an Argive princess, by Apollo, who, according to Statius, was
torn to pieces in his infancy by dogs.][Footnote 617: The son of Mæon.See the Note to the ninth
line of the Fifteenth Elegy of the First Book of the Amores.][Footnote 618: Slow web woven.--Ver.[Footnote 619: Nemesis, so Delia.--Ver.Nemesis and Delia were the
names of damsels whose charms were celebrated by Tibullus.][Footnote 620: Sacrifice avail thee.--Ver.He alludes to two lines
in the]

First Elegy of Tibullus.]'Quid tua nunc Isis mihi Delia?quid mihi prosunt]

Ilia tuâ toties sera repuisa manu.']What have I now to do, Delia, with your Isis?what avail me those sistra
so often shaken by your hand?'][Footnote 621: What lying apart.--Ver.During the festival of Isis,
all intercourse with men was forbidden to the female devotees.][Footnote 622: The yawning tomb.--Ver.The place where a person was
burnt was called 'bustum,' if he was afterwards buried on the same spot,
and 'ustrina,' or 'ustrinum,' if he was buried at a different place.See
the Notes to the Fasti, B. ii.[Footnote 623: The towers of Eryx--Ver.He alludes to Venus, who
had a splendid temple on Mount Eryx, in Sicily.][Footnote 624: The Phæacian land.--Ver.The Phæacians were the
ancient people of Corcyra, now the isle of Corfu.Tibullus had attended
Messala thither, and falling ill, was unable to accompany his patron on
his return to Rome, on which he addressed to him the First Elegy of his
Third Book, in which he expressed a hope that he might not die among
the Phæacians.Tibullus afterwards
recovered, and died at Rome.When he penned this line, Ovid little
thought that his own bones would one day rest in a much more ignoble
spot than Corcyra, and one much more repulsive to the habits of
civilization.]1 Hie'here seems to be the preferable
reading; alluding to Rome, in contradistinction to Corcyra.][Footnote 626: His tearful eyes.--Ver.He alludes to the custom of
the nearest relative closing the eyes of the dying person.][Footnote 627: The last gifts.--Ver.The perfumes and other
offerings which were thrown on the burning pile, are here alluded to.Tibullus says, in the same Elegy--]

'Non soror Assyrios cineri quæ dedat odores,]

Et Heat effusis ante sepulchra comis']

'No sister have I here to present to my ashes the Assyrian perfumes,
and to weep before my tomb with dishevelled locks.'To this passage Ovid
makes reference in the next two lines.][Footnote 628: Thy first love.--Ver.'Prior;' his former love was
Delia, who was forsaken by him for Nemesis.They are both represented
here as attending his obsequies.Tibullus says, in the First Elegy of
the First Book, addressing Delia:--]

1 Te spectem, suprema mihi cum venerit hora,]

Te teneam moriens, déficiente manu.]Flebis et arsuro positum me, Delia, lecto,]

Tristibus et lacrymis oscula mista dabis.']May I look upon you when my last hour comes, when dying, may I hold you
with my failing hand.Delia, you will lament me, too, when placed on my
bier, doomed to the pile, and will give me kisses mingled with the tears
of grief.'It would appear
from the present passage, that it was the custom to give the last kiss
when the body was laid on the funeral pile.][Footnote 629: With his failing hand.--Ver.Nemesis here alludes
to the above line, and tells Delia, that she, herself, alone engaged his
affection, as it was she alone who held his hand when he died.][Footnote 630: Learned Catullus.--Ver.Catullus was a Roman poet, a
native of Verona.Calvus was also a Roman poet of great merit.The poems
of Catullus and Calvus were set to music by Hermogenes, Tigellius, and
Demetrius, who were famous composers.lines
427 and 431, and the Notes to the passages.][Footnote 631: Prodigal of thy blood.--Ver.He alludes to the fact
of Gallus having killed himself, and to his having been suspected
of treason against Augustus, from whom he had received many marks of
kindness Ovid seems to hint, in the Tristia, Book ii.446, that the
fault of Gallus was his having divulged the secrets of Augustus, when
he was in a state o* inebriety.Some writers say, that when Governor of
Egypt, he caused his name and exploits to be inscribed on the Pyramids,
and that this constituted his crime.Others again, suppose that he was
guilty of extortion in Egypt, and that he especially harassed the people
of Thebea with his exactions.Some of the Commentators think that under
the name 'amicus,' Augustus is not here referred to, inasmuch as it
woulc seem to bespeak a familiar acquaintanceship, which is not known
to have existed.Scaliger thinks that it must refer to some
misunderstanding which had taken place between Gallus and Tibullus, in
which the former was accused of having deceived his friend.][Footnote 632: The rites of Ceres--Ver.This festival of Ceres
occurred on the Fifth of the Ides of April, being the 12th day of that
month.White garments, were worn at this
festival, and woollen robes of dark colour were prohibited.The worship
was conducted solely by females, and all intercourse with men was
forbidden, who were not allowed to approach the altars of the Goddess.][Footnote 633: The oaks, the early oracles.--Ver.On the oaks, the
oracles of Dodona, see the Translation of the Metamorphoses, pages 253
and 467.][Footnote 634: Having nurtured Jove.--Ver.See an account of the
education of Jupiter, by the Curetes, in Crete, in the Fourth Book of
the Fasti, L 499, et seq.][Footnote 635: Beheld Jasius.--Ver.Iasius, or Iasion, was,
according to most accounts, the son of Jupiter and Electra, and enjoyed
the favour of Ceres, by whom he was the father of Plutus.According
to the Scholiast on Theocritus, he was the son of Minos, and the Nymph
Phronia.According to Apollodorus, he was struck dead by the bolts of
Jupiter, for offering violence to Ceres.He was also said by some to
be the husband of Cybele.He is supposed to have been a successful
husbandman when agriculture was but little known; which circumstance is
thought to have given rise to the story of his familiarity with Ceres.Ovid repeats this charge against the chastity of Ceres, in the Tristia,
Book ii.[Footnote 636: Proportion of their wheat.--Ver.With less corn than
had been originally sown.][Footnote 637: The law-giving Mims.--Ver.Minos is said to have
been the first who gave laws to the Cretans.][Footnote 638: Late have the horns.--Ver.This figure is derived
from the horns, the weapons of the bull.'At length I have assumed the
weapons of defence.'It is rendered in a singular manner in Nisard's
Translation, 'Trop tard, helas 1 J'ai connu l'outrage fait a mon front.'I have known the outrage done to my forehead.'!!!][Footnote 639: Have patience and endure.--Ver.He addresses himself,
recommending fortitude as his only cure.][Footnote 640: The hard ground.--Ver.At the door of his mistress;
a practice which seems to have been very prevalent with the Roman
lovers.][Footnote 641: I was beheld by him.--Ver.As, of courser, his rival
would only laugh at him for his folly, and very deservedly.][Footnote 642: As you walked.--Ver.By the use of the word
'spatiantis,' he alludes to her walks under the Porticos of Rome, which
were much frequented as places for exercise, sheltered from the heat.][Footnote 643: The Gods forsworn.--Ver.This forms the subject of
the Third Elegy of the present Book.][Footnote 644: Young mem at banquets.--Ver.See the Fifth Elegy of
the Second Book of the Amores.][Footnote 645: She was not ill.--Ver.When he arrived, he found his
rival in her company.][Footnote 646: I will hate.--Ver.This and the next line are
considered by Heinsius and other Commentators to be spurious.][Footnote 647: She who but lately.--Ver.Commentators are at a
loss to know whether he is here referring to Corinna, or to his other
mistress, to whom he alludes in the Tenth Elegy of the Second Book,
when he confesses that he is in love with two mistresses.If Corinna was
anything more than an ideal personage, it is probable that she is not
meant here, as he made it a point not to discover to the world who was
meant under that name; whereas, the mistress here mentioned has been
recommended to the notice of the Roman youths by his poems.][Footnote 648: Made proclamation.--Ver.He says that, unconsciously,
he has been doing the duties of the 'præco' or 'crier,' in recommending
his mistress to the public.The 'præco,' among the Romans, was employed
in sales by auction, to advertise the time, place, and conditions of
sale, and very probably to recommend and praise the property offered
for sale.These officers also did the duty of the auctioneer, so far
as calling out the biddings, but the property was knocked down by the
'magister auctionum.'The 'præcones' were also employed to keep silence
in the public assemblies, to pronounce the votes of the centuries, to
summon the plaintiff and defendant upon trials, to proclaim the victors
in the public games, to invite the people to attend public funerals,
to recite the laws that were enacted, and, when goods were lost, to cry
them and search for them.The office of a 'præco' was, in the time of
Cicero, looked upon as rather disreputable.][Footnote 649: Thebes.--Ver.He speaks of the Theban war, the
Trojan war, and the exploits of Caesar, as being good subjects for Epic
poetry; but he says that he had neglected them, and had wasted his time
in singing in praise of Corinna.This, however, may be said in reproof
of his general habits of indolence, and not as necessarily implying that
Corinna is the cause of his present complaint.The Roman poet Statius
afterwards chose the Theban war as his subject.][Footnote 650: Poets as witnesses.--Ver.That is, 'to rely
implicitly on the testimony of poets.'The word 'poetas' requires a
semicolon after it, and not a comma.][Footnote 651: The raging dogs.--Ver.He here falls into his usual
mistake of confounding Scylla, the daughter of Nisus, with Scylla, the
Nymph, the rival of Circe, in the affections of Glaucus.33 of the First Epistle of Sabinus, and the Eighth and Fourteenth
Books of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 652: Descendant of Abas.--Ver.In the Fourth Book of the
Metamorphoses he relates the rescue of Andromeda from the sea monster,
by Perseus, the descendant of Abas, and clearly implies that he used
the services of the winged horse Pegasus on that occasion.It has been
suggested by some Commentators, that he here refers to Bellerophon; but
that hero was not a descendant of Abas, and, singularly enough, he is
not on any occasion mentioned or referred to by Ovid.][Footnote 653: Extended Tityus.--Ver.Tityus was a giant, the son
of Jupiter and Elara.Offering violence to Latona, he was pierced by the
darts of Apollo and hurled to the Infernal Regions, where his liver was
doomed to feed a vulture, without being consumed.][Footnote 654: Enceladus.--Ver.He was the son of Titan and Terra,
and joining in the war against the Gods, he was struck by lightning,
and thrown beneath Mount Ætna.See the Pontic Epistles, Book ii.[Footnote 655: The-two-shaped damsels.--Ver.He evidently alludes
to the Sirens, with their two shapes, and not to Circe, as some have
imagined.][Footnote 656: The Ithacan bags.--Ver.Æolus gave Ulysses
favourable wind* sewn up in a leather bag, to aid him in his return to
Ithaca.See tha Metamorphoses, Book xiv.223]

[Footnote 657: The Cecropian bird.--Ver.He calls Philomela the
daughter of Pandion, king of Athens, 'Cecropis ales Cc crops having been
the first king of Athens.Her story is told in the Sixth Book of the
Metamorphoses.][Footnote 658: A bird, or into gold.--Ver.He alludes to the
transformation of Jupiter into a swan, a shower of gold, and a bull; in
the cases of Leda, Danaë, and Europa.][Footnote 659: The Theban seed.--Ver.He alludes to the dragon's
teeth sown by Cadmus.See the Third Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 660: Distil amber tears.--Ver.Reference is made to the
transformation of the sisters of Phaeton into poplars that distilled
amber.See the Second Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 661: Who once were ships.--Ver.He alludes to the ships
of Æneas, which, when set on fire by Turnus, were changed into sea
Nymphs.][Footnote 662: The hellish banquet.--Ver.Reference is made to the
revenge of Atreus, who killed the children of Thyestes, and set them
on table before their father, on which occasion the Sun is said to have
hidden his face.][Footnote 663: Stonesfollowed the lyre.--Ver.Amphion is said to
have raised the walls of Thebes by the sound of his lyre.][Footnote 664: Camillus, by thee.--Ver.Marcus Furius Camillus, the
Roman general, took the city of Falisci.][Footnote 665: The covered paths.--Ver.The pipers, or flute
players, led the procession, while the ground was covered with carpets
or tapestry.][Footnote 666: Snow-white heifers.--Ver.Pliny the Elder, in his
Second Book, says, 'The river Clitumnus, in the state of Falisci, makes
those cattle white that drink of its waters.'][Footnote 667: In the lofty woods.--Ver.It is not known to what
occasion this refers.Juno is stated to have concealed herself on two
occasions; once before her marriage, when she fled from the pursuit of
Jupiter, who assumed the form of a cuckoo, that he might deceive her;
and again, when, through fear of the giants, the Gods took refuge in
Egypt and Libya.[Footnote 668: As a mark.--Ver.This is similar to the alleged
origin of the custom of throwing sticks at cocks on Shrove Tuesday.The
Saxons being about to rise in rebellion against their Norman oppressors,
the conspiracy is said to have been discovered through the inopportune
crowing of a cock, in revenge for which the whole race of chanticleers
were for centuries submitted to this cruel punishment.][Footnote 669: With garments.--Ver.As'vestis' was a general name
for a covering of any kind, it may refer to the carpets which appear to
be mentioned in the twelfth line, or it may mean, that the youths and
damsels threw their own garments in the path of the procession.][Footnote 670: After the Grecian manner.--Ver.Falisci was said to
have been a Grecian colony.][Footnote 671: Hold religious silence.--Ver.'Favere linguis' seems
here to mean, 'to keep religious silence as to the general meaning of
the term, see the Fasti, Book i.[Footnote 672: Halesus.--Ver.Halesus is said to have been the son
of Agamemnon, by a concubine.Alarmed at the tragic death of his father,
and of the murderers, Ægisthus and Clytemnestra, he fled to Italy, where
he founded the city of Phalesus, which title, with the addition of
one letter, was given to it after his name.Phalesus afterwards became
corrupted, to 'Faliscus,' or 'Falisci.'][Footnote 673: One side and the other.--Ver.For the 'torus
exterior' and 'interior,' and the construction of the beds of the
ancients, see the Note to the Eighth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.This passage seems to be hopelessly
corrupt.][Footnote 674: Turning-place is grazed.--Ver.On rounding the'meta'
in the chariot race, from which the present figure is derived, see the
Note to the 69th line of the Second Elegy of this Book.][Footnote 675: Heir to my rank.--Ver.112, where he enlarges upon the rank and circumstances of his family.][Footnote 676: To glorious arms.--Ver.He alludes to the Social
war which was commenced in the year of the City 659, by the Marsi, the
Peligni, and the Picentes, for the purpose of obtaining equal rights
and privileges with the Roman citizens.He calls them 'arma honesta,'
because wielded in defence of their liberties.][Footnote 677: Rome dreaded.--Ver.The Romans were so alarmed, that
they vowed to celebrate games in honour of Jupiter, if their arms should
prove successful.][Footnote 678: Amathusian parent.--Ver.Venus was worshipped
especially at Amathus, a city of Cyprus; it is mentioned by Ovid as
abounding in metals.[Footnote 679: The homed.--Ver.In addition to the reasons already
mentioned for Bacchus being represented as horned, it is said, by some,
that it arose from the fact, of wine being drunk from horns in the
early ages.It has been suggested, that it had a figurative meaning, and
implied the violence of those who are overtaken with wine.][Footnote 680: Lyæus.--Ver.For the meaning of the word Lyæus, see
the Metamorphoses, Book iv.[Footnote 681: My sportive.--Ver.Genialis; the Genii were the
Deities of pure, unadorned nature.58, and
the Note to the passage.'Genialis,' consequently, 'voluptuous,' or
'pleasing to the impulses of nature.']The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his
route to Lynchburg was still open before him; and he little dreamed that
our cavalry had planted itself directly across his path, until some of our
men dashed into Appomattox Court House, where, unfortunately, Lieutenant
Colonel Root, of the Fifteenth New York Cavalry, was instantly killed by a
picket guard.After we had seized the road, we were joined by other
divisions of the cavalry corps which came to our assistance, but too late
to take part in the fight.Owing to the night attack, our regiments were so mixed up that it took
hours to reorganize them.When this was effected, we marched near to the
railroad station and bivouacked.We threw ourselves on the ground
to rest, but not to sleep.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our
assistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line
would be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work
to head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud
hurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming
in rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving
towards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing
lively; but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry
corps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the
position of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who
greeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.At several places we had to "run the gauntlet" of fire from the enemy's
guns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest
of the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy
to put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at
last Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving
at almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of
a surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste
for the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a
party of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly
replied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a
charge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the
charge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we
halted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we
charged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front
was a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,
with batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have
charged this formidable array, mounted, would have resulted in almost
total annihilation.After we had halted, we were informed that
preliminaries were being arranged for the surrender of Lee's whole army.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon
all became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward
between the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends
among the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee
(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus
Wilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the
ground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I
called to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a
hostile manner.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General
Lee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General
Babcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our
lines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he
gracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,
which was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with
cheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and
the rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our
men, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations
with the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that
the rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels
seemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,
dissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands
eager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to
eat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with
Colonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender
had taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that
everything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in
whose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at
Manassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his
name in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden
harvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories
of these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record
of great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their
heads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the
congratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They
felt they had done their duty, and given the "tottering giant" a blow that
laid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.The curd is transferred, without breaking it more than can be avoided, to
perforated moulds four inches in diameter.The moulds are placed on reed
mats resting on slightly inclined slabs, made of slate, cement, or other
hard material, and having a gutter near the outer edge.The curd remains
in the moulds twenty-four or even forty-eight hours, according to the
season, being turned upside down after twelve or twenty-four hours; that
is, when sufficiently drained at the bottom.After turning the face of the
cheese, the inside of the mould is sprinkled with salt, and twelve hours
afterward the opposite face and the rim of the cheeses are treated in the
same way.The cheeses are then placed on movable shelves round the walls
of the dairy for a day or two, after which the curing process commences by
the cheeses being transferred to the "drying-room," and there placed on
shelves made of narrow strips of wood with narrow intervals between them,
or of ordinary planks with reed mats or clean rye straw.Here the greatest
ingenuity is exerted to secure as dry an atmosphere and as equable a
temperature as possible--the windows being numerous and small, and fitted
with glass, to exclude air, but not light, when the glass is shut, with a
wooden shutter to exclude both light and air; and with wire gauze to admit
light and air, and exclude flies and winged insects, which are troublesome
to the makers of soft cheese.The cheeses are turned at first once a day, and afterward every second
day, unless in damp weather, when daily turning is absolutely necessary.In three or four days after the cheeses are placed in the drying-room they
become speckled; in another week they are covered with a thick crop of
white mold, which by degrees deepens to a dark yellow, the outside of the
cheese becoming less and less sticky.At the end of about a month, when
the cheese no longer sticks to the fingers, it is taken to the finishing
room, where light is nearly excluded, and the atmosphere is kept very
still and slightly damp.Here they remain three or four weeks, being
turned every day or every second day, according to the season, and
carefully examined periodically.When ready for market--that is to say, in
winter, when ripe, and in summer, when half ripe--they are made up in
packets of six, by means of straw and paper, with great skill and
neatness.The Wisconsin Dairymen's Association last year offered prizes for the best
essays on butter-making, the essays not to exceed 250 words.Competition
was active, and many valuable little treatises was the result.The first
prize was won by D. W. Curtis, of Fort Atkinson, and reads as follows.We
commend it to all butter-makers and to all writers of essays as a model of
the boiled-down essence of brevity:

COWS.Pastures should be dry, free from slough-holes, well seeded with different
kinds of tame grasses, so that good feed is assured.If timothy or clover,
cut early and cure properly.Feed corn, stalks, pumpkins, ensilage and
plenty of vegetables in winter.Corn and oats, corn and bran, oil meal in small quantities.Let cows drink only such water as you would yourself.Brush the udder to free it from impurities.Milk in a clean barn, well
ventilated, quickly, cheerfully, with clean hands and pail.Strain while warm; submerge in water 48 degrees.Skim at twelve hours; at twenty-four hours.Care must be exercised to ripen cream by frequent stirrings, keeping at 60
degrees until slightly sour.Better have one cow less than be without a thermometer.Stir the cream thoroughly; temper to 60 degrees; warm or cool with water.Churn immediately when properly soured, slowly at first, with regular
motion, in 40 to 60 minutes.When butter is formed in granules the size of
wheat kernels, draw off the buttermilk; wash with cold water and brine
until no trace of buttermilk is left.Let the water drain out; weigh the butter; salt, one ounce to the pound;
sift salt on the butter, and work with lever worker.Set away two to four
hours; lightly re-work and pack.A MACHINE that can take hay, corn fodder, grass, and grain and manufacture
them into good, rich milk at the rate of a quart per hour for every hour
in the twenty-four, is a valuable one and should be well cared for.There
are machines--cows--which have done this.There are many thousands of them
that will come well up to this figure for several months in the year, and
which will, besides, through another system of organisms, turn out a calf
every year to perpetuate the race of machines.Man has it in his power to
increase the capacity of the cow for milk and the milk for cream.He must
furnish the motive power, the belts, and the oil in the form of proper
food, shelter, and kindly treatment.By withholding these he throws the
entire machinery out of gear and robs himself.KANE COUNTY, MARCH 17.--Snow is nearly all gone.There is but little frost
in the ground.Hay is plenty, winter wheat and
winter rye look green, and have not been winter-killed to any great
extent.Cattle and horses are looking well and are free from disease.We
fear the spread of the foot-and-mouth disease.Every effort should be made
to confine it within its present limits.Its spread in this county of so
great dairy interests would be a great calamity.Our factory men will make
full cream cheese during the summer months.The hard, skim cheese made
last season, and sold at 2 cts per pound, paid the patrons nothing.We
hear of factory dividends for January of $1.60 to $1.66.J. P. B.


GRAND PRAIRIE, TEX., MARCH 8.--The spring is cold and late here; but
little corn planted yet.Winter oats killed; many have sown again.Farmers
are well up with their work.*     *     *     *     *

[Illustration: VETERINARY]


Symptoms of Foot-and-Mouth Disease.This disease, which is one of the most easily transmitted of contagious
and infectious diseases of domestic animals, is characterized by the
appearance of vesicles or small bladders on the mucous surfaces and those
parts of the skin uncovered by hair, such as in the mouth, on the gums and
palate, on the tongue, and the internal surface of the lips and cheeks; on
the surface of the udder and teats, and between the claws.The disease
passes through four different stages or periods; but for present purposes
it will be sufficient to merely mention the most prominent of the
successive changes and appearances, as they occur to the ordinary
observer.The incubatory stage, or the time between contamination and the
development of the disease, is very short (from twenty-four hours to one
or two weeks), and the disease is ushered in by the general symptoms of
fever, such as shivering, increased temperature, staring coat, dry muzzle,
dullness and loss of appetite.The animals seek seclusion, preferably in
sheltered places, where they assume a crouched position, or lie down, and
there is more or less stiffness and unwillingness to move.The mouth
becomes hot and inflamed looking, and covered with slime, the breath
fetid; the animal grinds the teeth, smacks with mouth, and has difficulty
in swallowing.There is more or less tenderness of feet and lameness, and
in cows the udder becomes red and tender, the teats swollen, and they
refuse to be milked.Depending upon the intensity of the fever and the
extent to which the udder is affected, the milk secretion will be more or
less diminished, or entirely suspended; but throughout the disease the
quality or constituents of the milk become materially altered; its color
changes to a yellow; it has a tendency to rapid decomposition, and
possesses virulent properties.Soon yellowish-white blisters, of various
sizes, from that of a small pea to a small hickory nut, appear on the
mucous surface within the mouth, and which blisters often in the course of
development become confluent or coalesce.They generally break within two
to three days, and leave bright red, uneven, and ragged sores or ulcers,
to the edges of which adheres shreds of detached epithelial tissue.The
animal now constantly moves the tongue and smacks the mouth, while more or
less copious and viscid saliva continually dribbles from the mouth.The
lameness increases in proportion as the feet are affected, and if the fore
feet are most affected, the animal walks much like a floundered horse,
with the hinder limbs advanced far under the body, and with arched back.The coronet of the claws, especially toward the heels, becomes swollen,
hot, and tender, causing the animal to lie down most of the time.The
blisters, which appear at the interdigital space of the claws, and
especially at the heels, break in the course of a day and discharge a
thick, straw- fluid; the ulcers, which are of intensely red or
scarlet color, soon become covered with exudating lymph, which dries and
forms scabs.On the udder, the blisters appear more or less scattered and
variable, and they are most numerous at the base and on the teats.Ordinarily, the disease terminates in two or three weeks, while the
animal, which during its progress refuses to partake of any other than
sloppy food, gradually regains strength and flesh, and the udder resumes
its normal functions.The mortality at times has proved very great in this
disease when it has appeared with unusual virulency.In common "horse language," these propensities are confounded one with the
other or else no proper and right distinction is made between them.A
horse may be timid without being shy, though he can hardly be said to be
shy without being timid.Young horses in their breaking are timid,
frightened at every fresh or strange object they see.They stand gazing
and staring at objects they have not seen before, fearful to approach
them; but they do not run away from, or shy at them; on the contrary, the
moment they are convinced there is nothing hurtful in them, they refuse
not to approach or even trample upon them.He can not be persuaded to turn toward or even to look at the object he
shies at; much less to approach it.Timid horses, through usage and experience, get the better of their
timidity, and in time become very opposite to fearful; but shy horses,
unless worked down to fatigue and broken-spiritedness, rarely forget their
old sins.The best way to treat them is to work them, day by day,
moderately for hours together, taking no notice whatever of their shying
tricks, neither caressing nor chastising them, and on no account whatever
endeavoring to turn their heads either towards or away from the objects
shied at.With a view of shedding light on the important question of the
contagiousness of glanders, we will mention the following deductions from
facts brought forth by our own experience.That farcy and glanders, which constitute the same disease, are
propagable through the medium of stabling, and this we believe to be the
more usual way in which the disease is communicated from horse to horse.That infected stabling may harbor and retain the infection for months,
or even years; and though, by thoroughly cleansing and making use of
certain disinfecting means, the contagion may probably be destroyed, it
would not perhaps be wise to occupy such stables _immediately_ after such
supposed or alleged disinfection.That virus (or poison of glanders) may lie for months in a state of
incubation in the horse's constitution, before the disease breaks out.We
have had the most indubitable evidence of its lurking in one horse's
system for the space of fifteen weeks.That when a stud or stable of horses becomes contaminated, the disease
often makes fearful ravages among them before it quits them; and it is
only after a period of several months' exemption from all disease of the
kind that a clean bill of health can be safely rendered.A handsome book, beautifully Illustrated, with  diagrams, giving

[Illustration: HORTICULTURAL]

Horticulturists, Write for Your Paper.In THE PRAIRIE FARMER I notice the interesting note of "O."of Sheboygan
Falls, Wis., on the apparent benefit resulting from sand and manure
mulching of pear trees.In the very near future I expect to see much of this kind of work done by
commercial orchardists.Already we have many trees in Iowa mulched with
sand.I wish now to draw attention to the fact that on the rich black prairie
soils west of Saratov--about five hundred miles southeast of Moscow--every
tree in the profitable commercial orchards is mulched with pure river
sand.The crown of the tree when planted is placed about six inches lower
than usual with us in a sort of basin, about sixteen feet across.This
basin is then filled in with sand so that in the center, where the tree
stands, it is three or four inches higher than the general level of the
soil.The spaces between these slight depressions filled with sand are
seeded down to grass, which is not cut, but at time of fruit gathering is
flattened by brushing to make a soft bed for the dropping fruit and for a
winter mulch.The close observer will not fail to notice good reasons for this
treatment.The sand mulch maintains an even temperature and moisture
of the surface roots and soil and prevents a rapid evaporation of the
moisture coming up by capillary attraction from the sub soil.The soil under the sand will not freeze as deeply as on exposed
surfaces, and we were told that it would not freeze as deeply by two feet
or more as under the tramped grass in the interspaces.With the light  sand about the trees, and grass between, the
lower beds of air among the trees would not be as hot by several degrees
as the exposed surface, even when the soil was light  clay.A bed of sand around the trunks of the trees will close in with the
movement of the top by the summer and autumn winds, thus avoiding the
serious damage often resulting from the swaying of the trunk making an
opening in the soil for water to settle and freeze.Still another use is made of this sand in very dry seasons, which as with
us would often fail to carry the fruit to perfection.On the upper side of
large commercial orchards, large cisterns are constructed which are filled
by a small steam pump.When it is decided that watering is needed the sand
is drawn out, making a sort of circus ring around the trees which is run
full of water by putting on an extra length of V spouting for each tree.When one row is finished the conductors are passed over to next row as
needed.To water an orchard of 1,200 trees--after the handy fixtures are
once provided--seems but a small task.After the water settles away, the
sand is returned to its place.In the Province of Saratov we saw orchards with and without the sand, and
with and without the watering.We did not need to ask if the systematic
management paid.The great crops of smooth apples and pears, and the long
lived and perfect trees on the mulched and watered orchards told the whole
story of the needs of trees planted on black soil on an open plain subject
to extreme variations as to moisture and temperature of air and soil.BUDD., IOWA AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.The mere "experience" of an individual, whether as a doctor of medicine,
horticulture, or agriculture--however extensive, is comparatively
worthless.Indeed the million "demonstrate it to be mischievous, judging
from the success of quacks and empyrics as to money.An unlimited number
of facts and certificates prove nothing, either as to cause or remedy."Sir Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory "explained all the phenomena of
light, except one," and he actually assumed, for it "fits."Nevertheless
it will ever remain the most thinkable mode of teaching the laws of light,
and it is not probable that any more than this will ever be accomplished
as to any natural science--if that can be called science about which we
must admit that "it is not so; but it is as if it were so."Of more than 300 "Osband Summer" which I grafted on the Anger quince
successfully, one remains, and this one was transplanted after they had
fruited in a clay soil, to the same sort of soil between "the old
standard" and a stable, both of which have occupied the same locality and
within twenty yards, during much more than fifty years of my own
observation--this "Osband Summer" flourishes.It has borne fruit in its
present site, but grew so rapidly last year that the blossoms aborted thus
illustrating the large proportion of vital force necessary to the
production of fruit, as the site has a perennial supply of manure from the
old stable.A number of standard trees, of the same variety, developed
beautifully until they attained twenty or thirty feet, but then succumbed
to the blight, after the first effort at fruiting.So also the Beurre
Clairgean etc., etc.Their exposure to the same influences, and their
growth during several years did not occasion the blight, but the debility
which must inevitably attend fruiting seems the most prolific cause.All the phenomena of pear blight can be accounted for, and we are greatly
encouraged in protecting the trees therefrom if, we assume, it is only the
result of weakness and deficient vitality; if so, as in epidemics, all the
pear trees may be poisoned or ergotized, but only the weakest succumb; and
perhaps this debility may be confined to one limb.The practical value of
this view is manifest, as it is impracticable to avoid using the same
knife, and remove every blighted leaf from the orchard.Moreover, if the
limb is a large one, its prompt removal shocks the vitality of the whole
tree[1] and thus renders other parts more vulnerable.On the contrary
view, the limb may be allowed to drop by natural process, precisely as all
trees in a forest shed their lower limbs, leaving hardly a cicatrice or
scar, and this may be insured at any season by a cord of hemp twine,
firmly bound around the limb.The inevitable strangulation, and the
healing of the stump (without the mycelium of fungi which the knife or saw
inevitably propagates by exposing a denuded surface, if not more directly)
proceed more rapidly than the natural slough of limbs by starvation.Moreover the fruit may mature on such limbs during their strangulation, as
this may not be perfected before the subsequent winter.The next practical result of my view is the fundamental importance of all
those means which are calculated to husband the vital force of the tree
during its first effort to fruit; one of these is the use of a soil that
will not produce more than twenty bushels of corn without manure, thus a
large proportion of the setts will be aborted, but one half of what
remains should be removed, and subsequently the area beneath the limbs
should have a wheelbarrow of good compost.D. S.

  Footnote 1: NOTE.--The shock as to vital force is
     demonstrated by the fact that when young trees are not
     trimmed at all their girth increases more rapidly, and they
     bear fruit sooner.Moreover, when old trees are severely
     pruned (though not half the proportion of wood is removed)
     they fail to bear during the next year.I find that a hemp
     cord about the size of the stem of a tobacco pipe
     (one-fourth inch diameter) will soon become imbedded in the
     bark if firmly tied around a limb, and perhaps this size is
     more efficient than a thicker cord.The black walnut is without doubt the most valuable tree we have for the
rich lands of the "corn belt," West, and one which is very easily grown
everywhere if the farmer will only learn how to get it started.How few we
see growing on our prairies.Simply because to have it we must grow
it from the nuts.It is nearly impossible to transplant black walnut trees
of any size and have them live; although it is a fact that whenever a
non-professional attempts to grow them from the nuts he is almost sure to
fail, it is also a fact that there is no tree that is more easily grown
from the seed than this, if we only know how to do it.It is my purpose in this note to tell how to do it, and also how not to do
it.In the first instance we will suppose a man lives where he can gather the
nuts in the woods.When the nuts begin to fall let him plow deeply the
plot of ground he wishes to plant and furrow it off three or four inches
deep, the distance apart he wishes his rows to be.He will then go to the
woods and gather what nuts he wishes to plant, and plant them at once,
just as they come from the tree, covering them just out of sight in the
furrows.This is all there is of it; simple, is it not?But it will not do
to gather a great wagon box full, and let them stand in it until they
heat, or to throw them in a great heap on the ground and let them lay
there until they heat.It will not do, either, to hull them and let them
lay in the sun a week or two, or hull them, dry them and keep them until
spring, and then plant; none of these plans will do if you want trees.Of
course if the nuts are hulled and planted at once they will grow; but this
hulling is entirely unnecessary.Besides, the hulls seem to act as a
special manure for the young seedlings, causing them to grow more
vigorously.Next, we will suppose one wishes to plant walnuts where they can not be
had from the woods, but must be shipped in.There seems to be only one
plan by which this can be done safely every time, which is as follows:
Gather the nuts as they fall from the trees--of course when they begin to
fall naturally all may be shaken down at once--and spread them not over a
foot deep, on the bare ground under the shade of trees.Cover out of sight
with straw or leaves, with some sticks to hold in place called a "rot
heap;" then after they are frozen and will stay so, they may be shipped in
bags, boxes, barrels, or in bulk by the car-load, and then, again, placed
in "rot heaps," as above, until so early in the spring as the soil is in
workable condition.Then plant as directed in the fall, except the soil
should be firmly packed around the nuts.Keep free from weeds by good
cultivation, and in due time you will have a splendid grove.There was an immense crop of walnuts in this district last fall, and
thousands of bushels were put up carefully, in this way, all ready for
shipment before the weather became warm; many more thousands were planted
to grow seedlings from, for, notwithstanding the walnut transplants poorly
when of considerable size, the one year seedlings transplant with as
little loss as the average trees.There is no tree better adapted for planting to secure timber claims with
than the black walnut, and none more valuable when the timber is grown.For this purpose the land should be plowed deeply, then harrowed to
fineness and firmness, and furrowed out in rows four, six, eight, or ten
feet apart.It is best to plant
thickly in the rows, then if too thick they can be thinned out,
transplanting the thinnings, or selling them to the neighbors.They should
be thoroughly cultivated, until large enough to shade the ground, and
thinned out as necessary as they grow larger.A walnut grove thoroughly
cultivated the first ten years will grow at least twenty feet high, while
one not cultivated at all would only grow two to three feet in that time.WIER., LACON, ILL.Why can not Illinois have an Arbor Day as well as Nebraska, or any other
State.There ought to be ten millions of trees planted the coming spring
within its borders--saying nothing of orchard trees--by the roadside, on
lawns, for shade, for wind breaks, for shelter, for mechanical purposes,
and for climatic amelioration.Nearly all our towns and villages need more
trees along the streets or in parks; thousands of our farms are suffering
for them; hundreds of cemeteries would be beautified by them, and
numberless homes would be rendered more pleasant and homelike by an
addition of one, two, or a dozen, to their bleak places.Can not THE
PRAIRIE FARMER start a boom that will lead to the establishment of an
Arbor Day all over the State?For the benefit of those who can not command the usual appliances for
hot-beds, I will say that they can be made so as to answer a good purpose
very cheaply.Take a nice sunny spot that is covered with a sod, if to be
had.Dig off the sod in squares and pile them carefully on the north side
and the ends of the pit, to form the sides of the bed, with a proper
<DW72>.The soil thrown out from the bottom may be banked up against the
sods as a protection.After the bed is finished, the whole may be covered
with boards, to turn the water off.These answer in the place of glass
frames.As the main use for a hot-bed is to secure bottom heat, very good
results can be obtained in these cheaply constructed affairs.After the
seeds are up, and when the weather will permit, the boards must be removed
to give light and air--but replaced at night and before a rain.Of course,
where large quantities of plants are to be grown, of tender as well as
hardy sorts, it would be better and safer to go to the expense of board
frames and glass for covering.Of course, all the peach trees, and many of the other stone fruits, and
most of the blackberry and raspberry plants, will show discoloration of
wood when the spring opens--so much so that many will pronounce them
destroyed, and will proceed to cut them away.Peaches have
often been thus injured, and by judicious handling saved to bear crops for
years afterward.But they will need to be thoroughly cut back.Trees of
six or seven years old I have cut down so as to divest them of nearly all
their heads, when those heads seemed badly killed, and had them throw out
new heads, that made large growth and bore good crops the following
season.Cut them back judiciously, and feed them well, but don't destroy
them.Budd's articles on Russian Pears, can fail to be
interested and struck with the prospect of future successful pear culture
in the United States.It is highly probable that Russia is yet to give us
a class of that fruit that will withstand the rigors of our climate.Individual enterprise can, and doubtless
will, accomplish much in that direction; but the object seems to me to be
of sufficient importance to justify State or National action.The great
State of Illinois might possibly add millions to her resources by giving
material aid in the furtherance of this purpose--and a liberal expenditure
by the General Government, through the Department of Agriculture, or the
American Pomological Society, would be more usefully applied than many
other large sums annually voted.At all events, another season of fruitage
ought not to be allowed to pass without some concerted action for the
purpose of testing the question.Some of our strongest nurserymen will likely be moving in the work, but
that will not be enough.The propagator of that fruit, however, who will
succeed in procuring from the European regions a variety of pears that
will fill the bill required by the necessities of our soil and climate,
has a fortune at his command.OLD WINTER

lingers in the lap of spring, truly, this year of grace, 1884.Here it is
the 10th of March, and for over one hundred days we have had
winter--winter; but very few real mild and bright days, such as we had
"when I was a boy."The Mississippi is frozen over still, with no signs of
breaking up, and men, women, and children are sighing for sunshine and
showers, and daisies and violets.The wood and coal bills have been
enormous; the pigs squeal in the open pens, and cattle roam, as usual,
shivering in the lanes and along the streets.The song of a robin
to-morrow morning would be a joyous sound to hear.T. G.


Prunings.Tree-worship among the ancients had a most important influence on the
preservation of forests in circumscribed places.Beautiful groves, which
would otherwise have been sacrificed on the altar of immediate utility,
were preserved by the religious respect for trees.--Milwaukee Sentinel."Small trees have larger roots in proportion, (2) they cost
less, (3) expressage of freight is less--expressing small trees is usually
cheaper than freighting large ones, and then so much more speedy, (4) less
labor handling, digging holes, etc., (5) less exposed to high winds which
loosen roots, and kill many transplanted trees, (6) planters can form
heads and train them to their own liking, (7) with good care in, say five
years, they will overtake the common larger sized trees.Without good
care, better not plant any size."The coming currant is Fay's Prolific.It originated with Lincoln Fay, of
Chautauqua county, N. Y. For many years he endeavored to raise a currant
that would combine the size of the Cherry currant with the productiveness
of the Victoria.To this end he fertilized one with the pollen of the
other, and raised some thousands of seedlings, from out of which he
selected this as the one that most nearly realized his desires.It is now
sixteen years since this seedling was obtained.Fay tested this variety by the side of all the sorts in
cultivation, until becoming convinced of its superiority in several
particulars over any of these, he planted it extensively for his own
marketing.At a late meeting of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, the currant
worm came in for a good deal of talk.Satterthwaite said that
hellebore, as we have often printed, was the most effectual "remedy."He
mixed it with water and applied it with a brush or whisk of straw.If not
washed off by rain for twenty-four hours and used every year, the worms
were easily got rid of.Saunders, Superintendent of the Government
Gardens at Washington, and a gentleman thoroughly conversant with every
branch of horticulture, said that there was nothing so effectual with
insects as London purple, and, though equally poisonous as Paris green,
was much cheaper.Tobacco stems and refuse have also been found of great
value in fruit culture.Pyrethrum, he said, would also kill all sorts of
leaf-eating insects; it is now largely cultivated in California, and is
hardy at least as far north as Washington.JOSIAH HOOPES in New York Tribune: In Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey,
where, literally, no pears have been grown of late years, the Kieffer is
doing well.I ate specimens last season
finely flavored and delicious; again when they were weak and watery.This
fruit needs thinning on the trees and careful ripening in the house.Don't
understand me to say that Kieffer is "best of all."But here it is the
most profitable for market that I know of, as this is not a pear country,
as are portions of New York State.As we go further south the Kieffer
seems to improve, and I think Mr.Berckmans, of Georgia, will give it a
good name with him.Yes, the Kieffer will command a higher price in
Philadelphia than any other pear, and we think some people there know what
good fruit is.Don't imagine I have any axe on the grindstone in this
matter; pecuniarily the Kieffer is no more to me than the Bartlett or
dozens of other varieties.[Illustration: FLORICULTURE]

Some New Plants.ABUTILON THOMSONII PLENA.It is one of the peculiarities of plant culture, that after a certain
number of years of cultivation, any plant having the properties of
sporting freely, that is, changing greatly from the original wild
character of the plant, will become double.In most cases it first arises
from seed, but with the plant under notice it appears that it was what is
called a bud variation, that is, that from some freak of a particular
branch of a plant of the well-known A. Thomsonii, the ordinary single
flowers were found to be double.This happening on a plant under the eye
of a professional florist was taken off the plant and rooted, and at once
became its established character.This phenomena of variation being
"fixed" by separate propagation, is by no means rare, and not a few of our
choice fruits, flowers, and vegetables had their origin by the same means.It remains to be seen whether in this case it will be of much value except
as a curiosity, it having precisely the same leaf markings as the
original, which are a very distinct yellow mottling of the leaf in a field
of green, and for which the plant is valuable alone, the flowers being
quite of a secondary character.The flowers are said to be perfectly
double, resembling in form a double hollyhock, color deep orange, shaded
and streaked with crimson.This is the first year it has been sent out,
and we shall not be surprised if it is soon followed by others, for
usually, when the "double" condition of things has arrived no one has a
monopoly of the curiosity.ALTERNANTHERA AUREA NANA.This is a charming new plant of decided merit to the carpet style of
bedding or edging, being very compact in growth, easily kept to a line of
the finest character, and producing what is of great importance in the
summer, a line of golden yellow.At times the old kind, A. aurea, would
come very good, but more often it had far too much of a green shade to
furnish the contrast sought after, and, as a result, failed to bring out
the effect the planter studied to produce.It is a fitting companion to A.
amabilis, A. paronychioides, and A. versicolor, and will be hailed with
delight by our park florists and other scientific planters.BOUVARDIA THOMAS MEEHAN.Here we have a double scarlet bouvardia from the same raisers, Nanz and
Neuner, that astonished the floral world a few years back, with the double
white B. Alfred Neuner.This new addition, unlike the old, which was
another "bud variation," was secured by a cross between the old B.
leiantha, scarlet with a single flower, and Alfred Neuner, double white.If this is the real origin of the kind, which we somewhat doubt, for if
our theory is correct, that a certain amount of cultivation predisposes to
double variation, then it is not necessary to cross the double, which in
fact can not be done with a perfectly double flower--the organs of
fructification being wanting with that of a single and seed-producing
kind, to account for the origin of a new double.As is well known the old leiantha is one of the best scarlets yet, and
this new candidate for favor is said to unite the brilliant color and
profuse blooming qualities of the old favorite B. leiantha with the
perfect double flowers of B. Alfred Neuner.There are now of this class of plants the three colors--white, scarlet,
and pink--in double as well as single; for instance, a pink President
Garfield sported from and was "fixed" from the white A. Neuner, a year or
two ago.In this we have a right regal plant.We first heard of it from the German
catalogues, early in the past winter.This plant is now offered for sale
by the florists of this country.Its description from the catalogues is as
follows: "One of the finest novelties in the list of showy annuals lately
introduced.Its branching flower spikes, of a very bright rose, with a
crimson shade, appear successively from ten to fifteen on each plant, and
measure, each, fully fifteen to eighteen inches in height, and from
one-half to one inch in breadth; the foliage, laying flat on the ground,
is comparatively small, and completely hidden by the numerous flower
spikes, each leaf being five inches long, and from one-half to two inches
broad, undulated and glaucous.It is constantly in bloom during the summer
and autumn, and when in full bloom is a truly magnificent sight, being one
mass of flowers."This class of plants are great favorites, and we should
judge by the  flowers and description that this variety is a
decided novelty.TEA ROSES, WHITE BON SILENE.This is another new aspirant for favor, and comes out with the high
sounding character of being in a white what the old Bon Silene is as a red
winter tea rose.The description from the catalogue is: "The buds are
larger and more double than its parent (the red B.and will produce
more flower buds than any other white rose in cultivation."It was raised by Francis Morat, of Louisville, Ky., four years ago; it is
also a "sport," and from the old B. silene.Should it retain the good
flowering qualities, fragrance, and substance of the original kind, with a
pure white bud, it will very soon work its way into popular favor.Usually
a white variation has not the vitality that its  progenitor had, so
that we say, wait and see.[Illustration: OUR BOOK TABLE]

No city upon the American continent has a larger floating population than
Washington.It is estimated that during the sessions of Congress
twenty-five thousand people, whose homes are in various parts of this and

attracted by the advantages the city offers for making the acquaintance of
public men; others have various claims which they wish to present, while
the great majority gather here, as crows flock to the carrion, for the
sole purpose of getting a morsel at the public crib.The latter class, as
a general thing, originate the many schemes which terminate in vicious
bills, all of which are either directed at the public treasury or toward
that revenue which the black-mailing of corporations or private
enterprises may bring.While walking down Pennsylvania avenue the other day I met Mr.William M.
Ashley, formerly of your city, whose long residence here has made him
unusually well acquainted with the operations of the lobby.Having made my wants in this particular direction known, in answer to an
interrogative, Mr.Ashley said:

"Yes, during my residence here I have become well acquainted with the
workings of the 'Third House,' as it is termed, and could tell you of
numerous jobs, which, like the 'Heathen Chinee,' are peculiar.""You do not regard the lobby, as a body, vicious, do you?""Not necessarily so, there are good and bad men comprising that body; yet
there have been times when it must be admitted that the combined power of
the 'Third House' has overridden the will of the people.The bad influence
of the lobby can be seen in the numerous blood-bills that are introduced
at every session.""Easily enough, to the person who has made the thing a study."Tell me, to what bills do you refer?""Well, take the annual gas bills, for instance.They are introduced for
the purpose of bleeding the Washington Gas Light company.They usually
result in an investigating committee which never amounts to anything more
than a draft upon the public treasury for the expenses of the
investigation.Another squeeze is the _abattoir_ bills, as they are
called.These, of course, are fought by the butchers and market-men.The
first attempt to force a bill of this description was in 1877, when a
prominent Washington politician offered a fabulous sum for the franchise.""Anything else in this line that you think of, Mr."Yes, there's the job to reclaim the Potomac flats, which, had it become a
law, would have resulted in an enormous steal.The work is now being done
by the Government itself, and will rid the place of that malarial
atmosphere of which we hear so much outside the city.""During your residence here have you experienced the bad results of living
in this climate?""Well, while I have not at all times enjoyed good health, I am certain
that the difficulty which laid me up so long was not malarial.It was
something that had troubled me for years.A shooting, stinging pain that
at times attacked different parts of my body.One day my right arm and leg
would torture me with pain, there would be great redness, heat and
swelling of the parts; and perhaps the next day the left arm and leg would
be similarly affected.Then again it would locate in some particular part
of my body and produce a tenderness which would well nigh drive me
frantic.There would be weeks at a time that I would be afflicted with an
intermitting kind of pain that would come on every afternoon and leave me
comparatively free from suffering during the balance of the twenty-four
hours.Then I would have terrible paroxysms of pain coming on at any time
during the day or night when I would be obliged to lie upon my back for
hours and keep as motionless as possible.Every time I attempted to move a
chilly sensation would pass over my body, or I would faint from hot
flashes.I suffered from a spasmodic contraction of the muscles and a
soreness of the back and bowels, and even my eyeballs become sore and
distressed me greatly whenever I wiped my face.I became ill-tempered,
peevish, fretful, irritable and desperately despondent.""Of course you consulted the doctors regarding your difficulty?"Some told me I had neuralgia;
others that I had inflammatory rheumatism, for which there was no cure,
that I would be afflicted all my life, and that time alone would mitigate
my sufferings.""But didn't they try to relieve your miseries?""Yes, they vomited and physicked me, blistered and bled me, plastered and
oiled me, sweat, steamed, and everything but froze me, but without avail.""I had a friend living in Michigan who had been afflicted in a similar way
and had been cured.He wrote me regarding his recovery and advised me to
try the remedy which cured him.I procured a bottle and commenced its use,
taking a teaspoonful after each meal and at bed-time.I had used it about
a week when I noticed a decrease of the soreness of the joints and a
general feeling of relief.I persevered in its use and finally got so I
could move around without limping, when I told my friends that it was
Warner's Safe Rheumatic Cure that had put me on my feet.""And do you regard your cure as permanent?""Certainly, I haven't been so well in years as I am now, and although I
have been subjected to frequent and severe changes of weather this winter,
I have not felt the first intimation of the return of my rheumatic
trouble.""Do you object to the publication of this interview, Mr.I look upon it as a duty I owe my fellow creatures to
alleviate their sufferings so far as I am able, and any communication
regarding my symptoms and cure that may be sent to me at 506 Maine avenue
will receive prompt and careful attention.""Judging from your recital, Mr.Ashley, there must be wonderful curative
properties about this medicine?""Indeed, there is, sir, for no man suffered more nor longer than did I
before this remedy gave me relief.""To go back to the original subject, Mr.Ashley, I suppose you see the
same familiar faces about the lobby session after session?""No, not so much so as you might think.New faces are constantly seen and
old ones disappear.The strain upon lobbyists is necessarily very great,
and when you add to this the demoralizing effect of late hours and
intemperate habits and the fact that they are after found out in their
steals, their disappearance can easily be accounted for.""What proportion of these blood-bills are successful?"Notwithstanding the power and influence of
the lobby, but few of these vicious measures pass.Were they successful it
would be a sad commentary upon our system of government, and would
virtually annihilate one branch of it.The great majority of them are
either reported adversely or smothered in committee by the watchfulness
and loyalty of our congressmen."J. E. D.

At the next American Fat Stock Show in Chicago, there promises to be an
extensive exhibit of dairy products.The Illinois Dairymen's Association
will have it in charge, and the State Board of Agriculture has decided to
appropriate $500 as a premium fund for the Dairymen's Association.It is
rather strange, yet nevertheless true, that Illinois has never yet had an
exhibition of dairy products at all commensurate with the importance of
the dairy interest of the State.It may now be reasonably predicted that
this remark will not remain true after November next.We have heard
nothing said about it, but it is to be presumed there will be no extra
charge to visit this exhibit.The managers of the Fat Stock Show have not
been satisfied, we believe, with experiments in this direction.*     *     *     *     *

Many years ago a young Scotch gardener brought from Mexico to Kenosha,
Wis., a specimen of the Century plant.It was then supposed to be about
twenty years old.For more than forty years this man cared for his pet
with unflagging faithfulness.Dying at the age of sixty-five he left it to
the care of a little daughter of a lady who had shown him kindness.This
girl grew to womanhood and to middle age caring tenderly for the plant.About two years ago the plant exhibiting signs of blooming, a gentleman
joined with the lady and erected a building for it near the Exposition
building, in this city.Here it has since been, but through carelessness
it was unduly exposed to the terrible freeze of the first week in January
last, and the plant is now past recovery.The lady had expended upon it
about all the means she possessed expecting to reap from admission fees to
see it a rich reward.Thus eighty years of care and constant expense came
to naught in a single night.A neglect to order coal resulted in the fire
going out just when the cold was the most intense.One can hardly imagine
the disappointment and regret of the lady who had nursed it with such care
for nearly a lifetime.The white pine lumber product of the Northwest last year was according to
latest returns, 7,624,789,786 feet against 3,993,780,000 in 1873, and more
than double what it was in 1874.In 1882 the production was nearly
100,000,000 feet less than last year.The smallest product of the decade
was in 1877--3,595,333,496 feet.What is termed the Chicago District,
including the points of Green Bay, Cheboygan, Manistee, Ludington, White
Lake, Muskegon, Grand Haven, and Spring Lake, and a few scattering mills
gave a product in 1883 of 2,111,070,076 feet.At Ludington and Grand Haven
there has been a decline in the product since 1873; at all the other
points the increase has been considerable, amounting to a total of nearly
800,000,000 feet.The largest cut is on the Mississippi river in what is
known as the West of Chicago District.Here in 1873 the product amounted
to 650,000,000 feet; last year it reached 1,290,062,690 feet.The Saginaw
Valley gives the next greatest yield 961,781,164 feet.The total Saginaw
district gave last year 1,439,852,067 feet against 792,358,000 ten years
ago.The total of the West of Chicago District was 3,134,331,793 against
1,353,000,000 in 1873.The Railroad and Interior Mills District has
increased something over 200,000,000 feet in this period.In shingles we have the grand product in all the Northwest of
3,964,736,639 against 2,277,433,550 in 1873.The greatest increase was in
the Chicago District as given above, and here Ludington and Grand Haven
come in for an increase at the former place of over 33,000,000, and the
latter of more than 100,000,000.The total production of shingles in 1882
was larger than last year by about 130,000,000, but with that exception
was the largest ever known.The census of 1880 placed the annual lumber product of the United States
at 18,000,000,000 feet.The Northwest then produced 5,651,295,000 feet or
nearly one-third the entire product of the country.If this ratio has been
uniform since we must now have a yield of over 20,000,000,000 feet.These
are figures of enormous magnitude and of varied import.They mean
employment to an army of men, a large shipping interest, vast investments
in mills and machinery, and vast incomes to owners of pine lands; they
mean houses and barns and fences to a new and populous empire; they mean
numberless farms and millions of live stock.They also signify a rapid
destruction of our immense forests from the face of the earth, enormous
prices for lumber to future generations, and possible floods to devastate
our river bottoms, and drouths to scourge the highlands.They should
impress us all with the necessity and the profitableness of timber
planting on the unsettled and newly settled prairies and in thousands of
places in all the older States.FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.Alarming reports from different parts of the country announcing the
presence of foot-and-mouth disease have caused no inconsiderable
excitement among the people and in Government circles.First there came
news of an outbreak in Effingham county, Illinois, then in Louisa county,
Iowa, quickly followed by similar information from Adair county, Missouri.Paaren, dispatched to Effingham county by the Governor, reports the
trouble there not foot-and-mouth disease.There does exist a disease
there, however, similar to foot-rot in sheep, that is proving fatal to
many cattle.There have also been outbreaks of disease among cattle near
Duquoin and Xenia, Illinois, which Dr.Paaren has been directed to
investigate.No official reports as to the disease in Iowa and Missouri have been
received, though Government Veterinary inspectors are now upon the ground
making their investigations.It is said that several hundred head of
cattle are affected in Missouri, though this is probably an exaggeration.There is no news regarding the disease in Maine.Reports from Kansas say the infected herds are strictly quarantined, and
that as yet no fresh outbreaks have occurred.It is proposed to annihilate
the five infected herds.Glick has convened the Legislature of Kansas in order that proper
measures may be taken to protect the cattle interests of the State.A Des Moines dispatch dated the 15th, says letters from Louisa county to
the Governor in regard to the new cattle disease were read in the House,
and on motion of Mr.Watrous that body adopted the substitute for the bill
providing for the appointment of a State veterinary surgeon.The
substitute authorizes the veterinary surgeon to destroy all stock affected
with contagious disease.The bill is intended to enable the State to take
action in the foot-and-mouth disease now affecting the stock.Discussion
then followed upon the substitute, which was taken up section by section,
and it was for the most part adopted.The series of reported outbreaks mentioned has aroused Congress to the
necessity of action.The Senate on Monday passed a joint resolution
appropriating $50,000 for the suppression of the disease in whatever State
or Territory it appears.It is to be hoped that the Animal Industry bill will at once pass and
become a law.The cattle dealers at the Chicago Union Stock Yards have
organized a Live Stock Exchange, and the first action taken by it is to
fight this bill in Congress.Emory A. Storrs, attorney for the heavy
brokers, is in Washington working might and main for its defeat.He finds
it uphill work, evidently, for on Monday he sent a dispatch to Nelson
Morris in these words: "Send to-day a delegation of strong men; everything
now depends on backing; wire me at once protest; have seen several
senators this morning; advise me when delegation starts; have them stop at
Riggs house."Acting under this advice the Exchange passed the following resolutions of
"unbelief."Whereas, It is the universal sentiment of the Chicago Live
     Stock Exchange, at the Union Stock Yards in Chicago, that
     the bill now pending before Congress, known as the "Animal
     Industry bill," is dangerous in its design, not called for
     by the condition of the live stock interest in this
     country, and tends to place too much power in the
     Department of Agriculture at Washington; therefore,

     Resolved, That Elmer Washburn, Allan Gregory, F. D.
     Bartlett, B. F. Harrison, and H. H. Conover, members of
     this exchange, be, and hereby are, appointed a committee,
     with instructions to proceed forthwith to Washington, and
     present these resolutions to the proper authorities to
     prevent the passage of said "Animal Industry bill."Resolved, Further, that owing to the present excitement
     throughout the United States over the false alarm of
     pleuro-pneumonia and "foot-and-mouth" disease, that we, as
     a body, should express our views fully upon this question.We do not believe there is such a disease as contagious
     pleuro-pneumonia existing throughout the United States.We do not believe that such a disease as the
     foot-and-mouth disease exists in either Illinois, Iowa, or
     Kansas.That at no time within the space of twenty years have
     the cattle, sheep, or hogs of this country been in as
     healthy a condition as at the present time; for while we
     are in favor of strict quarantine laws to prevent any
     importation of disease into this country from abroad, we
     believe if any disease should break out in this State, or
     any other State, that the citizens would be interested
     sufficiently to stamp it out without expense to the
     National Government.Detmers appeared in the
hall (accidentally of course!)and gave it as his opinion that not a
single case of foot-and-mouth disease existed in America to-day.But the
Doctor has so often put his foot in it in his mouthings about animal
diseases in the past that his beliefs or disbeliefs have little weight
with the public.The Doctor is evidently "put out" because he was not
called upon to visit the infected districts, for he is reported as ending
his harangue by declaring he was tired of working for the Government, and
offered his services to the Live Stock Exchange.Such, in brief, is a summary of the news of the week concerning the
foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in the States.As briefly stated in a previous issue of THE PRAIRIE FARMER, the Illinois
State Board of Agriculture offers a premium of $100 for the best bushel of
corn (in ear) grown this year in the northern division of the State, and
$50 for the second best bushel: and a like premium for the best and second
best bushel grown in the central and southern divisions.These divisions
correspond with the three judicial divisions of the State.The following
are the conditions:

Each of the parties awarded the first premium to deliver twenty-five
bushels, and each of the parties awarded the second premium to deliver
fifteen bushels of corn in the ear in sacks to the State Board of
Agriculture at Springfield, Ill.The corn delivered to be equal in quality
to the samples awarded the respective premiums.The premiums to be paid
when the premium bushels of corn and the amounts called for are compared
at the rooms of the Department of Agriculture and favorably reported upon
by the committee.Affidavit as to measurement of land and yield of corn are required.We suppose also that competitors are to furnish characteristics of soil,
variety of seed, kinds of manure used, mode of cultivation etc., as these
facts would seem to be necessary if the public is to receive the full
benefits of the experiments the premiums are likely to bring out.It is understood that the corn delivered to the State Board as per above
conditions is to be in some judicious manner distributed to the
corn-growers of the State for planting in 1885.THE FIRST UNFORTUNATE RESULT.There recently began in Scotland an earnest movement to induce the British
Government to remove the restrictions regarding the importation of
American cattle, so far at least as to allow the admission of store cattle
for feeding purposes.Meetings have been held in various parts of Scotland
at which petitions like the following were adopted.To the Right Honorable William Ewart Gladstone.We, the undersigned, farmers and others, respectfully
     submit that the present law which allows the importation of
     cattle from the United States, and shuts out store cattle,
     is unjust and oppressive to the farmers of this country,
     and enhances the price of meat to the public.We therefore
     crave that her Majesty's Government would open the Scottish
     ports to the introduction of store cattle from the Western
     States where disease does not exist.At a meeting at Montrose, where the above petition was favorably acted
upon, Mr.Falconer, an Angus farmer, in supporting the motion, said that
the first great remedy for the present depression was to get cheap store
cattle, and that would never be got until they opened their ports to the
Western States of America.He held that if farmers would agree to insist
on live store cattle being allowed to be landed in Britain, they would
soon get them.When they get them, he, if then alive, would be quite
willing to take all the responsibility if they found an unsound or
unhealthy animal amongst them.He appealed to butchers in Montrose, who
had been in the way of killing States or Canadian cattle, if they were not
totally free of disease; and he would like to ask them how many Irish
cattle they killed which were perfectly healthy.If they got stores from
America, they would not effect a saving in price, but, as they all knew,
sound healthy cattle fed much quicker than unsound, and were of better
quality, and thus an additional item of profit would be secured to the
farmer.A. Milne, cattle-dealer, Montrose, corroborated Mr.Falconer's
statements as to the healthiness of American stock, while Irish cattle, as
a rule, he said, had very bad livers.Adamson, Morphie, said he had recently been in the Western States of
America, and had seen a number of the ranches in Nebraska, Wyoming, and
Colorado.The cattle there were certainly fine animals--well bred, as a
rule, either from Herefords or Short-horns, with a dash of the Texan
cattle in them.When there, he made careful inquiries as to the existence
of disease, and he was universally told that such a thing as epidemic
disease was unknown.No doubt in the southern part of Texas there was a
little Texan fever, but that, like yellow fever, was merely indigenous to
the district.He considered it would
be a great boon to the farmers of Scotland if they could get cattle L3 or
L4 cheaper than at present.It would save a very considerable amount of
money in stocking a farm, and would also tell on the profits of the
feeders, and the prices paid by the consumers.They had them to spare in
America in the greatest possible abundance.At a late meeting of the Prairie Cattle Company, having headquarters in
Scotland, sheriff Guthrie Smith expressed the opinion that the great
profit in the future of American ranch companies must be the trade in
young cattle.He believed that Scottish farmers would ere long get all
their young cattle, not from Ireland, but from the United States.It did
not pay them to breed calves; they were better selling milk.The fattening
of cattle for the butcher was the paying part of the business, but the
difficulty was to get yearlings or two-year-olds at their proper price.Here promised to arise a new outlet for American stock, and one which most
of us probably never thought of.The proposition had in it the elements
for the building up of a great commercial industry and of affording a new
and rapid impetus to the breeding of cattle upon the plains.But just at
this time comes the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Kansas, Maine,
and Illinois, and of course puts an end to all hopes in this direction,
for many months at least.This is the result of the disease at its first
appearance.Here is prospective loss before the Government veterinary
surgeons fairly reach the field of operations against its spread--the loss
of a trade which would have been worth many millions to the cattle raisers
of the great West.It is to be feared that this is but the beginning of
the losses the disease will entail upon us.Can Congress longer hesitate
in this matter of providing an efficient law for protection from
contagious animal diseases?Our State authorities,
also, must be alert, and render all possible aid in preventing the spread
of this wonderfully infectious disease.*     *     *     *     *

We have a large number of letters and postal cards asking where various
seeds, plants, shrubs, trees, silk-worm eggs, bone dust and so on and so
forth to an indefinite extent, may be obtained.We have answered some of
these inquiries by letter, some through the paper, but they still keep
coming.We have one favor to ask of those seeking this sort of
information: First look through the advertisements carefully, and see if
what is wanted is not advertised.The seedsmen's advertisements do not, of
course, enumerate all the parties have for sale, but it may be taken for
granted that they keep nearly all kinds of grass, grain, and vegetable
seeds.We would also say to seedsmen that it will probably be found to pay
them to advertise the seeds of the new grasses, alfalfa, the special
fertilizers, etc., that are now being so much inquired about.We have a
large number of inquiries about where to obtain silk-worm eggs.Persons
who have them certainly make a mistake in not advertising them freely.O. G. B., SHEBOYGAN FALLS, WIS.--Will you give directions which will be
practical for tanning skins or pelts with the fur or hair on by the use of
oak bark?ANSWER.--We know of no way the thing can be done unless a part of the
methods are used that are employed in the tanning of goat skins for making
Morocco leather.These are: to soak the skins to soften them; then put
them into a lime vat to remove the hair, and after to take the lime out in
a douche consisting of hen and pigeon dung.This done, the skins are then
sewed up so as to hold the tanning liquid, which consists of a warm and
strong decoction of Spanish sumac.The skins are filled with this liquid,
then piled up one above the other and subsequently refilled, two or three
times, or as fast as the liquid is forced through the skins.If the furs
or pelts were first soaked to soften them, all the fatty, fleshy matter
carefully removed, after sewed up as goat skins are, and then filled and
refilled several times with a strong decoction of white oak bark, warm,
but not hot, no doubt the result would prove satisfactory.J. F. SCHLIEMAN, HARTFORD, WIS.--Are there any works on the
cultivation of the blueberry, and if so could you furnish the same?Do you
know of any parties that cultivate them?ANSWER.--We have never come across anything satisfactory on the
cultivation of the blueberry except in Le Bon Jardiniere, which says: "The
successful cultivation of the whole tribe of Vacciniums is very difficult.The shrubs do not live long and are reproduced with much difficulty,
either by layers or seeds."The blueberry, like the cranberry, appears to
be a potash plant, the swamp variety not growing well except where the
water is soft, the soil peaty above and sandy below.The same appears also
to be true of the high land blueberry; the soil where they grow is
generally sandy and the water soft.You can procure Le Bon Jardiniere (a
work which is a treasure to the amateur in fruit and plants) of Jansen,
McClurg & Co., of Chicago, at 30 cents, the franc.Some parties, we think,
offer blueberry plants for sale, but we do not recollect who they are.H. HARRIS, HOLT'S PRAIRIE, ILL.--Will it do to tile drain land
which has a hard pan of red clay twelve to eighteen inches below the
surface?ANSWER.--It will do no harm to the land to drain it if there is a hard pan
near the surface, but in order to make tile draining effective on such
land, the drains will have to be at half the distance common on soils
without the hard pan.SUBSCRIBER, DECATUR, ILL.--In testing seed corn, what per cent must sprout
to be called first-class.I have some twenty bushels of Stowell's
Evergreen that was carefully gathered, assorted, and shelled by hand.This I have tested by planting twenty-one grains, of which sixteen grew.ANSWER.--Ninety-five, certainly.If five kernels out of twenty-one failed
to grow, that would be 31 per cent of bad seed, and we should consider the
quality inferior.But further, if under the favorable condition of trial,
31 percent failed, ten grains in every twenty-one would be almost sure to,
in the field.It was a mistake to shell the corn; seed should always
remain on the cob to the last moment, because if it is machine or
hand-shelled at low temperature, and put away in bulk, when warm weather
comes, it is sure to sweat, and if it heats, the germ is destroyed.Better
spread your corn out in the dry, and where it will not freeze, as soon as
you can.L. C. LEANIARTT (?)NEBRASKA.--I wish to secure a blue grass pasture in my
timber for hogs.Will it be necessary to keep them out till the grass
gets a good start?Shall I follow the directions you gave Mr.Perkins
in THE PRAIRIE FARMER, February 9?Is not blue grass pasture the best
thing I can give my hogs?Better do so, and you will then be more likely to get a good
catch and full stand.Blue grass is very good for hogs, but it is improved by the addition of
clover.C. C. SAMUELS, SPRINGFIELD, ILL.--1.What pears would you recommend for
this latitude?I have some grape
vines, light  fruit, but late, Elvira, I think the nurseryman told
me, which appear to be suffering from something at the roots.What is the
phylloxera, and what shall I do to my grape vines if they infest the
roots?ANSWER.--The Bartlett for _certain_--it being the best of all the
pears--and the Kieffer and Le Conte for _experiment_.If the latter
succeed you will have lots of nice large fruit just about as desirable for
eating as a Ben Davis apple in May.We know of one only, the Tyson, a
smallish summer pear that never blights, at least in some localities,
where all others do more or less.If your Elviras are afflicted with
the phylloxera, a root-bark louse, manure and fertilize them at once, and
irrigate or water them in the warm season.The French vine-growers seem at
last to have found out that lice afflict half starved grape roots, as they
do half starved cattle, and that they have only to feed and water
carefully to restore their vines to health.J. S. S., SPRINGFIELD, ILL.--I am not a stock man nor a farmer; but I have
some pecuniary interests, in common with others, my friends, in a Kansas
cattle ranch.I am therefore a good deal exercised about this
foot-and-mouth disease.Is it the terrible scourge reported by one cattle
doctor, who, according to the papers, says, "the only remedies are fire or
death."ANSWER.--The disease is a bad one, very contagious, but easily yields to
remedies in the first stages.THOMAS V. JOHNSON, LEXINGTON, KY.--There is a report here that your draft
horses of all breeds are not crossing with satisfaction on your common
steeds in Illinois, and that not more twenty five in one hundred of the
mares for the last three years have thrown foal, nor will they the present
season.ANSWER.--Our correspondent has certainly been misinformed, or is an
unconscious victim of local jealousy, as he may easily convince himself by
visiting interior towns, every one of which is a horse market.BY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.A neighbor of mine who has been intending to purchase store cattle and
sheep at the Chicago Stock Yards soon, asked me last night what I thought
about his doing so.I asked him if he had read what THE PRAIRIE
FARMER and other papers had contained of late regarding foot-and-mouth
disease in Maine, Kansas, Illinois, and Iowa.He had not; did not take the
papers, and had not heard anything about the disease here or in England.Then I explained to him, as best I could, its nature, contagious
character, etc., and having a PRAIRIE FARMER in my pocket, read him your
brief history of the ailment in Great Britain.Finally, said he, What has that got to do with my question
about buying cattle and sheep at the stock yards?Just this, I replied:
every day there are arrivals at the stock yards of many thousands of
cattle from these infected States.Perhaps some of them come from the very
counties where this disease is known to exist.The disease may break out
any day in scores of places in all these States.It may appear--indeed is
quite likely to do so at the stock yards.For aught I know it may be there
now.The cattle brokers will not be very likely to make known such an
unwelcome fact a minute sooner than they are obliged to.In fact, from
what they have lately been saying about the absurdity of new and stringent
enactments concerning animal diseases, I conclude they will labor to
conceal cases that may really exist.Now you go there to pick up cattle to
consume your pasturage this spring and summer, and don't you see you run
the risk of taking to your home and neighborhood a disease that may cost
you and your neighbors many thousands of dollars?If I were you I would
pick up the stock I want in my own neighborhood and county, even though
not exactly the kind I would like to have, and though it would cost me a
great deal more time and trouble.You see to a Man of the Prairie things
look a little squally in this cattle business.We have all got to be
careful about this thing.We have a terrible enemy at our stable doors and
pasture gates, and we must guard them well.I am not an alarmist, but I
would run any time, almost, rather than get licked, and I have always
tried to keep a lock on the stable door before the horse is stolen.I am
in favor of _in_-trenchment.Perhaps my advice to my neighbor was not
sound, but according to the light I have, I have no desire to recall it
till I hear more from the infected districts.To show the difference between the winter in Colorado and the States this
way and further west, the Farmer, of Denver, mentions the fact that it
knows a farmer who has had about two hundred acres of new land broken
between the middle of November and the first of March.Still, these
Eastern States have advantages which render them rather pleasant to live
in.Our farmers find plenty of time in fall and spring in which to do
their plowing and sowing, and our severe winters don't seem to hurt the
ground a bit.In fact, I suppose it has got used to them, sort of
acclimated, as it were.We have pretty good markets, low railway fares,
good schools and plenty of them, and we manage to enjoy ourselves just as
well as though we could hitch up to the plow and do our breaking in
December and January.We can't all go to Colorado, Dakota, Montana, or
Washington Territory, nor to those other Edens at the South and Southwest
where a man, so far as winter is concerned, may work about every day in
the year; but don't do so any more than we here at the North where we have
the excuse of severe weather for our laziness between November and April.I like Colorado and Wyoming, Arkansas and Texas, Alabama and Florida--for
other people who like to make their homes there, but my home is here and I
like it."I don't _have_ to" plow in winter, and I don't need to.I am
going to try to do my duty and be happy where I am, believing Heaven to be
just as near Illinois as any other State or any Territory.I read in the dispatches this morning that the barns on a ranch near Omaha
burned the other night.With the barns were consumed twenty-six cows,
eighteen horses, 1,000 bushels of corn and a large lot of hay and oats.In
all the loss amounted to above $10,000 and there was no insurance.From
all over the country and at all times of the year I read almost daily of
similar losses varying from $100 up into the thousands, and the closing
sentence of about nine out of ten of these announcements is "no
insurance."Now I am neither an insurance agent nor a lightning rod
peddler, but there are two luxuries that I indulge in all the time, and
these are an insurance policy to fairly cover my farm buildings and their
contents, and what I believe to be well constructed lightning rods in
sufficient number to protect the property from electric eccentricities.True, my buildings have never suffered from fire or lightning and these
luxuries have cost me no inconsiderable amount of cash, but this money has
brought me relief from a heap of anxiety, for I know in case my property
is swept away I am not left stripped and powerless to provide for my
family, and I know that it will not be necessary to mortgage the farm to
furnish them a shelter.I don't take _cheap_ insurance either, but invest
my money in the policy of a company which I believe has abundant capital
and is cautiously managed.A wealthy man can take his fire risks in his
own hands if he chooses, but for a man of small or moderate means it seems
to me the height of folly to do so.I would rather go without tobacco or
"biled shirts" than insurance and lightning rods.I don't know that an American farmer ever had the gout.Certainly I never
heard of such a case.If one does get the ailment, however, if he keeps
bees he always has a sure remedy at hand.A German has discovered that if
a bee is allowed to sting the affected part, a cure is instantaneous.Why
don't Bismarck try this home remedy for his complication of gout and
trichinae?REMEMBER _that $2.00 pays for_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER _one year, and the

[Illustration: Poultry Notes.]One of my correspondents writes: "My hens don't eat well--they just pick
over the food as if it were not good enough for them--and they don't lay
well; in fact they don't do much of anything except to mope about--not as
if sick, but as if lazy."Probably you have fed the same thing every day for the last six months,
and the hens are getting tired of it.Hens are like other people--they
like a change of provender once in awhile--especially when confined
indoors.Sometimes over-feeding will cause indigestion, and then the
biddies will exhibit the symptoms you describe.In either case, let the
fowls fast for a whole day, and then for a few days feed lightly with food
that is different from what they have been living on.Give plenty of green
food, also Douglas' mixture in the drinking water twice a week.Another correspondent wants to know why I always advise giving cooked food
to fowls and chicks when uncooked food is the natural diet.I advise cooked food because experience has taught me that it is much
better for poultry than the raw articles would be.Because raw bugs and
worms constitute the "natural diet" of fowls in their wild state, it does
not follow that raw meal and potatoes would be the best and most
economical food for our domestic fowls.Other things being equal, chicks
that are fed on cooked food grow fatter, are less liable to disease, and
thrive better generally than those who worry along on uncooked rations.If you are short of sitting hens and don't own an incubator, make the hens
do double duty.Set two or more at the same time, and when the chicks come
out, give two families to one hen, and set the other over again.To do
this successfully, the chicks must be taken from the nest as soon as dry
and given to the hen that is to raise them; for if a hen once leaves the
nest with her chicks, no amount of moral suasion will induce her to go
back.Before giving the hen fresh eggs, the nest should be renovated and
the hen dusted with sulphur or something to prevent lice.A lady who commenced raising thoroughbred poultry last season writes me
that she proposes to sell eggs for hatching this season, and asks for
information about advertising, packing eggs, etc.The advertising is easy enough: all you have to do is to write a copy of
your "ad.," send it to THE PRAIRIE FARMER and other papers that circulate
among farmers, pay the bills, and answer the postals and letters as they
come.But if I were in your shoes, I would "put my foot down" on the
postals to begin with; they don't amount to anything anyway; the people
who ask a long string of questions on a postal card are not, as a rule,
the ones who become customers.Before we went into the poultry business an
old poultry-breeder said: "Don't have anything to do with postals, it
don't pay."We thought differently, but to satisfy ourselves, we kept
track of the postals, and to-day I have the addresses of over 300 people
who wrote us on postal cards.Just one, and he was an Ohio man.When I go into that branch of the
poultry business again, my advertisements will contain a postscript which
will read thusly: "No postals answered."And you need not expect that every letter will mean business; people who
have not the remotest idea of buying eggs will write and ask your prices,
etc., and you must answer them all alike.Here is where circulars save
lots of work and postage.I have sent you by mail what I call a model
circular, and from that you can get up something to fit your case.Pack
your eggs in baskets in cut straw or chaff, first wrapping each egg
separately in paper.The eggs should not touch each other or the basket.Put plenty of packing on top, and with a darning needle and stout twine
sew on a cover of stout cotton cloth.For the address use shipping tags,
or else mark it plainly on the white cotton cover; I prefer the latter
way.A day or two before you ship the eggs send a postal telling your
customer when to look for them; that's all that postals are good for.Concerning the duplicating of orders in cases of failure of the eggs to
hatch, I quote from one of my old circulars: "I guarantee to furnish fresh
eggs, true to name, from pure-bred, standard fowls, packed to carry safely
any distance.In cases of total failure, when the eggs have been properly
cared for and set within two weeks after arrival, orders will be
duplicated free of charge."I furnished just what I promised, and when a
total failure was reported I sent the second sitting free--though
sometimes I felt sure that the eggs were not properly cared for, and once
a man reported a failure when, as I afterwards learned, eight eggs of the
first sitting hatched.But, generally speaking, my customers were pretty
well satisfied.It sometimes happens that only one or two eggs out of a
sitting will hatch, and naturally the customer feels that he has not
received the worth of his money.In such cases, if both parties are
willing to do just what is right, the matter can be arranged so that all
will be satisfied.And you will sometimes get hold of a customer that
nothing under the heavens will satisfy; when this happens, do just exactly
as you would wish to be done by, and there let the matter end.If the lady who wrote from Carroll county, Illinois, concerning an
incubator, will write again and give the name of her postoffice, she will
receive a reply by mail.Although yesterday was very cold and inclement, to-day (March 11th) is
warm and pleasant, and bees that are wintered upon their summer stands
will be upon the wing.It would be well on such days as this to see that
all entrances to hives are open, so that no hindrances may be in the way
of house-cleaning.This is all we think necessary for this month, provided
they have plenty of stores to last until flowers bloom.Handling bees
tends to excite them to brood rearing, and veterans in bee-culture claim
that this uses up the vitality of bees in spring very fast.Although more
young may be reared, it is at the risk of the old ones, as they leave the
hive in search of water; many thus perish, which often results in the
death of the colony, as the young perish for want of nurses.Sometimes,
also, in handling bees early in the season the queens are lost, as they
may fall upon the ground, yet chilled, and perish.Bees consume food very fast while rearing brood; naturalists tells us that
insects during the larvae state consume more food than they do during the
remainder of their existence.Where a bee-keeper has been so improvident
as to neglect to provide abundance of stores for his bees he should
examine them carefully, and if found wanting, remove an empty frame,
substituting a full one in its place.Where frames of honey are not to be
had, liquid honey and sugar can be kneaded together, forming cakes, which
can be placed over the cluster.Care should be taken that no apertures are
left, thus forming a way for cold drafts through the hive.These cakes are
thought to excite bees less than when liquid food is given; they have
another advantage, also, viz., bees can cluster upon them while feeding,
and do not get chilled.Bees that have been wintered in cellars, or special repositories, are
often injured by being removed too early to their summer stands.It would
be better to let them remain, and lower the temperature during warm days
with ice, until warm weather has come to stay.An aged veteran in Vermont
that we visited the season following the disastrous winter of 1880-81,
told us that his neighbors removed their bees from the cellar during a
warm spell early in spring, and they were then in splendid condition.He
let his bees remain until pollen was plentiful, and brought them out, all
being in fine order; by this time his neighbors' colonies were all dead.Good judgment and care must be exercised in removing bees from the cellar,
or disastrous results will follow.We know of an apiary of over one
hundred colonies that was badly injured, indeed nearly ruined, by all
being taken from the cellar at once on a fine, warm day.The bees all
poured out of the hives for a play spell, like children from school, and
having been confined so long together in one apartment had acquired, in
some measure, the same scent, and soon things were badly mixed.Some
colonies swarmed, others caught the fever, and piled up together in a huge
mass.This merry making may have been fun for the bees, but it was the
reverse of this for the owner, as many queens were destroyed, and hives
that were populous before were carried from the cellar and left without a
bee to care for the unhatched brood.When it is time to remove bees from the cellar the stands they are to
occupy should be prepared beforehand.They should be higher at the back,
inclining to the front; if the height of two bricks are at the back, one
will answer for the front.This inclination to the front is an important
matter; it facilitates the carrying out of dead bees and debris from the
hive, the escape of moisture, and last, and most important item, bees will
build their comb straight in the frame instead of crosswise of the hive,
and their surplus comb in boxes correspondingly.If a few hives are
removed near the close of the day and put in different parts of the
apiary, the danger from swarming out is avoided, for the bees will become
quiet before morning, and being far apart will not mix up when they have
their play spell.The success of bee-keeping depends upon the faithful
performance of infinite little items.L. L. Langstroth will be pained to learn that
he has a severe attack of his old malady and unable to do any mental work.May the Lord deal kindly and gently with him.During the last fall and winter he has been the light of many conventions,
and it will be remembered as a pleasant episode in the lives of many
bee-keepers that they had the privilege of viewing his beaming
countenance, hearing the words of wisdom as they escaped from his lips,
and taking the hand of this truly great and good man.L. HARRISON


Extracted Honey.A couple of copies of THE PRAIRIE FARMER have lately come to my desk, a
reminder of my boyhood days, when, in the old home with my father, I used
to contribute an article now and then to its columns.There is an old
scrap-book on the shelf, at my right, now, with some of those articles in
it, published nearly thirty years ago.But my object in writing now is to
add something to Mrs.Last year my
honey crop was about 3,000 pounds, and half of this was extracted, or
slung honey, as we bee-keepers often call it; but for next year I have
decided to raise nearly all comb honey, for the reason that I do not get
customers so readily for extracted honey.I have never extracted until the
honey was all, or nearly all, capped over, and then admitted air into the
vessels holding it, so as to be absolutely sure of getting it "dry," and
proof against souring.This method has given me about half the amount
others obtained by extracting as soon as the combs were filled by the
bees, and ripening afterward.But in spite of all these precautions I find so much prejudice against
extracted honey, growing out of the ignorance of the public with regard to
this sweet, ignorance equaled only by the ignorance in regard to bees
themselves, that the sale of such honey has been very slow; so slow that
while my comb honey is reduced at this date to about 150 pounds, I have
several ten-gallon kegs of pure white honey still on hand.Especially is there a prejudice against candied honey, though that is an
absolute test of purity, and it can be readily liquified, as Mrs.When I say that it is an absolute test of purity I mean
that all honey that candies evenly is pure, though some of the best honey
I have ever had never candied at all.In one case I knew the honey to
candy in the combs of a new swarm early in autumn; but some seasons,
particularly very dry ones, it will hardly candy at all.This difference
seems to be due to the varying proportion of natural glucose, which will
crystallize, and levulose, or mellose, which will not crystallize.Manufactured glucose will not crystallize; and some of our largest honey
merchants, even the Thurbers, of New York, have mixed artificial glucose
with honey to avoid loss by the ignorant prejudice of the public.CAMM., MORGAN CO., ILL.South'n Wisconsin Bee-keepers' Ass'n.The bee-keepers met in Janesville, Wis., on the 4th inst., and organized a
permanent society, to be known as the Southern Wisconsin Bee-keepers'
Association.The following named persons were elected officers for the
ensuing year: President, C. O. Shannon; Vice-President, Levi Fatzinger;
Secretary, J. T. Pomeroy; Treasurer, W. S. Squire.The regular sessions of the association will be held on the first Tuesday
of March in each year.Special meetings will also be held, the time of
which will be determined at previous meeting.The object of the association is to promote scientific bee-culture, and
form a bond of union among bee-keepers.Any person may become a member by
signing the constitution, and paying a fee of fifty cents.The next
meeting will be held at the Pember house, Janesville, on the first Tuesday
in May at 10 o'clock A. M. All bee-keepers are cordially invited to
attend.The Secretary, of Edgerton, Rock Co., Wis., will conduct the

Loaned netting investors 7 per cent.In a private letter to the editor of THE PRAIRIE FARMER Dr.L. S.
Pennington, of Whiteside County, Illinois, says: "Many thanks for your
instructive articles on Silk Culture.Could the many miles of Osage orange
found in this State be utilized for this purpose, the industry would give
employment to thousands of dependent women and children, by which means
they could make themselves, at least in part, self-supporting.I hope that
you will continue to publish and instruct your many readers on this
subject."Anent this subject we find the following by Prof.C. V. Riley in a late
issue of the American Naturalist:

"There is a strong disposition on the part of those who look for making
money by the propagation and sale of mulberry trees, to underrate the use
of Osage orange as silk-worm food.We have thoroughly demonstrated, by the
most careful tests, on several occasions, that when Maclura aurantiaca is
properly used for this purpose, the resulting silk loses nothing in
quantity or quality, and we have now a strain of Sericaria mori that has
been fed upon the plant for twelve consecutive years without
deterioration.There has been, perhaps, a slight loss of color which, if
anything, must be looked upon as an advantage.It is more than likely, how
ever, that the different races will differ in their adaptability to the
Maclura, and that for the first year the sudden transition to Maclura from
Morus, upon which the worms have been fed for centuries, may result in
some depreciation.Virion des Lauriers, at the silk farm at Genito,
has completed some experiments on the relative value of the two plants,
which he details in the opening number of the Silk-Grower's Guide and
Manufacturer's Gazette.The race
known as the "Var" was fed throughout on mulberry leaves.The "Pyrenean"
and "Cevennes" worms were fed throughout on leaves and branches of Osage
orange, while the "Milanese" worms were fed on Maclura up to the second
molt and then changed to mulberry leaves.At the close examples of each
variety of cocoons were sent to the Secretary of the Silk Board at Lyons,
and appraised by him The Maclura-fed cocoons were rated at 85 cents per
pound, those raised partly on Osage and partly on mulberry at 95 cents per
pound, and those fed entirely on mulberry at $1.11 per pound.des Lauriers thinks, seems to show that the difference between
Maclura and Morus as silk-worm food is some 'twenty-five to thirty per
cent in favor of the latter, while it is evident that the leaf of the
Osage orange can be used with some advantage during the first two ages of
the worms, thus allowing the mulberry tree to grow more leafy for feeding
during the last three ages.'The experiment, although interesting, is not
conclusive, from the simple fact that different races were used in the
different tests and not the same races, so that the result may have been
due, to a certain extent, to race and not to food."A writer in an English medical journal declares that the raising of the
head of the bed, by placing under each leg a block of the thickness of two
bricks, is an effective remedy for cramps.Patients who have suffered at
night, crying aloud with pain, have found this plan to afford immediate,
certain, and permanent relief.California stands fifth in the list of States in the manufacture of salt,
and is the only State in the Union where the distillation of salt from sea
water is carried on to any considerable extent.This industry has
increased rapidly during the last twenty years.The production has risen
from 44,000 bushels in 1860 to upwards of 880,000 bushels in 1883.The amount of attention given to purely technical education in Saxony is
shown by the fact that there are now in that kingdom the following
schools: A technical high school in Dresden, a technical State institute
at Chemnitz, and art schools in Dresden and Leipzig, also four builders'
schools, two for the manufacture of toys, six for shipbuilders, three for
basket weavers, and fourteen for lace making.Besides these there are the
following trade schools supported by different trades, foundations,
endowments, and districts: Two for decorative painting, one for
watchmakers, one for sheet metal workers, three for musical instrument
makers, one for druggists (not pharmacy), twenty-seven for weaving, one
for machine embroidery, two for tailors, one for barbers and hairdressers,
three for hand spinning, six for straw weaving, three for wood carving,
four for steam boiler heating, six for female handiwork.There are,
moreover, seventeen technical advanced schools, two for gardeners, eight
agricultural, and twenty-six commercial schools.The Patrie reports, with apparent faith, an invention of Dr.Raydt, of
Hanover, who claims to have developed fully the utility of carbonic acid
as a motive agent.Under the pressure of forty atmospheres this acid is
reduced to a liquid state, and when the pressure is removed it evaporates
and expands into a bulk 500 times as great as that it occupied before.It
is by means of this double process that the Hanoverian chemist proposes to
obtain such important benefits from the agent he employs.A quantity of
the fluid is liquified, and then stowed away in strong metal receptacles,
securely fastened and provided with a duct and valve.By opening the valve
free passage is given to the gas, which escapes with great force, and may
be used instead of steam for working in a piston.One of the principal
uses to which it has been put is to act as a temporary motive power for
fire engines.Iron cases of liquified carbonic acid are fitted on to the
boiler of the machine, and are always ready for use, so that while steam
is being got up, and the engines can not yet be regularly worked in the
usual way, the piston valves can be supplied with acid gas.There is,
however, another remarkable object to which the new agent can be directed,
and to which it has been recently applied in some experiments conducted at
Kiel.This is the floating of sunken vessels by means of artificial
bladders.It has been found that a bladder or balloon of twenty feet
diameter, filled with air, will raise a mass of over 100 tons.Hitherto
these floats have been distended by pumping air into them through pipes
from above by a cumbrous and tedious process, but Dr.Raydt merely affixes
a sufficient number of his iron gas-accumulators to the necks of the
floats to be used, and then by releasing the gas fills them at once with
the contents.DAIRY SUPPLIES, Etc.[Illustration of a swing churn]

[Illustration: HOUSEHOLD.]For nothing lovelier can be found
  In woman than to study _household_ good.--_Milton._


How He Ventilated the Cellar.The effect of foul air upon milk, cream, and butter was often alluded to
at the Dairymen's meeting at DeKalb.A great bane to the dairyman is
carbonic acid gas.In ill ventilated cellars it not only has a pernicious
effect upon milk and its products, but it often renders the living
apartments unhealthful, and brings disease and death to the family.W. D. Hoard, President of the Northwestern
Dairymen's Association, related the following incident showing how easily
cellars may be ventilated and rendered fit receptacles for articles of
food:

"In the city of Fort Atkinson, where I do reside, Mr.Clapp, the president
of the bank told me that for twenty years he had been unable to keep any
milk or butter or common food of the family in the cellar.I went and
looked at it, and saw gathered on the sleepers above large beads of
moisture, and then knew what was the matter.Wilkins is here and will tell you in a few
moments how to remedy this difficulty, and make your cellar a clean and
wholesome apartment of your house.'I went down and got the professor, and
he went up and looked at the cellar, and he says, 'for ten dollars I will
put you in possession of a cellar that will be clean and wholesome.'He
went to work and took a four-inch pipe, made of galvanized iron, soldered
tightly at the joints, passing it down the side of the cellar wall until
it came within two inches of the bottom of the cellar, turned a square
elbow at the top of the wall, carried it under the house, under the
kitchen, up through the kitchen floor and into the kitchen chimney, about
four feet above where the kitchen stovepipe entered.You know the kitchen
stove in all families is in operation about three times a day.The heat
from this kitchen stove acting on the column of air in that little pipe
caused a vacuum, and nature abhors a vacuum, and the result was that in
twenty-four hours that little pipe had drawn the entire foul air out of
the cellar, and he has now a perfect cellar.I drop this hint to show you
that it is within easy reach of every one, for the sum of only about ten
dollars, to have a perfectly ventilated cellar.This carbonic acid gas is
very heavy.It collects in the cellar and you can not get it out unless
you dip it out like water, or pump it out; and it becomes necessary to
apply something to it that shall operate in this way."This is a matter of such importance, and yet so little thought about, that
we had designed having an illustration made to accompany this article, but
conclude the arrangment is so simple that any one can go to work and adapt
it to the peculiar construction of his own house, and we hope thousands
will make use of Mr.As far as the nuptial ceremony itself was concerned, the Romans were in
the habit of celebrating it with many imposing rites and customs, some of
which are still in use in this country.As soon, therefore, as the
sooth-sayer had taken the necessary omens, the ceremony was commenced by a
sheep being sacrificed to Juno, under whose special guardianship marriage
was supposed to rest.The fleece was next laid upon two chairs, on which
the bride and bridegroom sat, over whom prayers were then said.At the
conclusion of the service the bride was led by three young men to the home
of her husband.She generally took with her a distaff and spindle filled
with wool, indicative of the first work in her new married life--spinning
fresh garments for her husband.The threshold of the house was gaily decorated with flowers and garlands;
and in order to keep out infection it was anointed with certain unctuous
perfumes.As a preservative, moreover, against sorcery and evil
influences, it was disenchanted by various charms.After being thus
prepared, the bride was lifted over the threshold, it being considered
unlucky for her to tread across it on first entering her husband's house.The musicians then struck up their music, and the company sang their
"Epithalamium."The keys of the house were then placed in the young wife's
hands, symbolic of her now being mistress.A cake, too, baked by the
vestal virgins, which had been carried before her in the procession from
the place of the marriage ceremony to the husband's home, was now divided
among the guests.To enhance the merriment of the festive occasion, the
bridegroom threw nuts among the boys, who then, as nowadays enjoyed
heartily a grand scramble.Once upon a time there lived a certain man and wife, and their name--well,
I think it must have been Smith, Mr.Smith said to her husband: "John, I really think we must
have the stove up in the sitting-room."Smith from behind his
newspaper answered "Well."Three hundred and forty-six times did Mr.Smith repeat this conversation, and the three hundred and
forty-seventh time Mr.Smith added: "I'll get Brown to help me about it
some day."It is uncertain how long the matter would have rested thus, had not Mrs.Smith crossed the street and asked neighbor Brown to come over and help
her husband set up a stove, and as she was not his wife he politely
consented and came at once.With a great deal of grunting, puffing, and banging, accompanied by some
words not usually mentioned in polite society, the two men at last got the
stove down from the attic.Smith had placed the zinc in its proper
position, and they put the stove way to one side of it, but of course that
didn't matter.Then they proceeded to put up the stovepipe.Smith pushed the knee
into the chimney, and Mr.The
next thing was to get the two pieces to come together.They pushed and
pulled, they yanked and wrenched, they rubbed off the blacking onto their
hands, they uttered remarks, wise and otherwise.Smith that a hammer was just the thing that
was needed, and he went for one.Brown improved the opportunity to
wipe the perspiration from his noble brow, totally oblivious of the fact
that he thereby ornamented his severe countenance with several landscapes
done in stove blacking.The hammer didn't seem to be just the thing that
was needed, after all.Smith pounded until he had spoiled the shape of
the stovepipe, and still the pesky thing wouldn't go in, so he became
exasperated and threw away the hammer.Brown's toe, and
that worthy man ejaculated--well, it's no matter what he ejaculated.Smith replied to his ejaculation, and then Mr.Smith, after making a
great deal of commotion, finally succeeded in getting the pipe into place,
that he was perfectly savage to everybody for the rest of the day, and
that the next time he and Brown met on the street both were looking
intently the other way.It came to pass in the course of the winter
that the pipe needed cleaning out.Smith dreaded the ordeal, both for
her own sake and her husband's.It happened that the kitchen was presided
over by that rarest of treasures, a good-natured, competent hired girl.This divinity proposed that they dispense with Mr.Smith's help in
cleaning out the pipe, and Mrs.Smith, with a sigh of relief, consented.They carefully pulled the pipe apart, and, holding the pieces in a
horizontal position that no soot might fall on the carpet, carried it into
the yard.After they had swept out the pipe and carried it back they attempted to
put it up.That must have been an unusually obstinate pipe, for it
steadily refused to go together.Smith and her housemaid
were sufficiently broad to grasp this fact after a few trials; therefore
they did not waste their strength in vain attempts, but rested, and in an
exceedingly un-masculine way held a consultation.The girl went for a
hammer, and brought also a bit of board.She placed this on the top of the
pipe, raised her hammer, Mrs.Smith held the pipe in place below, two
slight raps, and, lo, it was done.This story is true, with the exception of the
names and a few other unimportant items.I say, and will maintain it, that
as a general thing a woman has more brains and patience and less stupidity
than a man.I challenge any one to prove the contrary.--_N.In the course of a lecture on the resources of New Brunswick, Professor
Brown, of the Ontario Agricultural College, told the following story by an
Arabian writer:

"I passed one day by a very rude and beautifully situated hamlet in a vast
forest, and asked a savage whom I saw how long it had been there.'It is
indeed an old place,' replied he.'We know it has stood there for 100 years
as the hunting home of the great St.John, but how long previous to that
we do not know.'"One century afterward, as I passed by the same place, I found a busy
little city reaching down to the sea, where ships were loading timber for
distant lands.On asking one of the inhabitants how long this had
flourished, he replied: 'I am looking to the future years, and not to what
has gone past, and have no time to answer such questions.'"On my return there 100 years afterward, I found a very smoky and
wonderfully-populous city, with many tall chimneys, and asked one of the
inhabitants how long it had been founded.'It is indeed a mighty city,'
replied he.'We know not how long it has existed, and our ancestors there
on this subject are as ignorant as ourselves.'"Another century after that as I passed by the same place, I found a much
greater city than before, but could not see the tall chimneys, and the air
was pure as crystal; the country to the north and the east and the west,
was covered with noble mansions and great farms, full of many cattle and
sheep.I demanded of a peasant, who was reaping grain on the sands of the
sea-shore, how long ago this change took place?'In sooth, a strange
question!''This ground and city have never been different
from what you now behold them.''Were there not of old,' said I,'many
great manufacturers in this city?''Never,' answered he,'so far as we
have seen, and never did our fathers speak to us of any such.'"On my return there, 100 years afterward, I found the city was built
across the sea east-ward into the opposite country; there were no horses,
and no smoke of any kind came from the dwellings."The inhabitants were traveling through the air on wires which stretched
far into the country on every side, and the whole land was covered with
many mighty trees and great vineyards, so that the noble mansions could
not be seen for the magnitude of the fruit thereof."Lastly, on coming back again, after an equal lapse of time, I could not
perceive the slightest vestige of the city.I inquired of a very old and
saintly man, who appeared to be under deep emotion, and who stood alone
upon the spot, how long it had been destroyed.'Is this a question,' said
he, 'from a man like you?Know ye not that cities are not now part of the
human economy?Every one travels through the air on wings of electricity,
and lives in separate dwellings scattered all over the land; the ships of
the sea are driven by the same power, and go above or below as found to be
best for them.In the cultivation of the soil,' said he, 'neither horse
nor steam-power are employed; the plow is not known, nor are fertilizers
of any more value in growing the crops of the field.Electricity is
carried under the surface of every farm and all over-head like a net; when
the inhabitants require rain for any particular purpose, it is drawn down
from the heavens by similar means.The influence of electricity has
destroyed all evil things, and removed all diseases from among men and
beasts, and every living thing upon the earth.All things have changed,
and what was once the noble city of my name is to become the great meeting
place of all the leaders of science throughout the whole world.'"Gunkettle, as she spanked the baby in her calm, motherly
way, "it's a perfect shame, Mr.G., that you never bring me home anything
to read!I might as well be shut up in a lunatic asylum.""I think so, too," responded the unfeeling man.Gunkettle, as she gave the baby a marble to
swallow, to stop its noise, "have magazines till they can't rest.""Oh, yes; a horrid old report of the fruit interests of Michigan; lots of
news in that!"and she sat down on the baby with renewed vigor."I'm sure it's plum full of currant news of the latest dates," said the
miserable man.Gunkettle retorted that she wouldn't give a fig for a
whole library of such reading, when 'apple-ly the baby shrieked loud
enough to drown all other sounds, and peace was at once restored.Mouce Traps and Other Sweetemetes.The following advertisement is copied from the Fairfield Gazette of

Little Pleasantries.A Sweet thing in bonnets: A honey bee.It will get so in Illinois, by and by, that the marriage ceremony will run

  LITTLE DILLY-DALLY.I don't believe you ever
   Knew any one so silly
  As the girl I'm going to tell about--
   A little girl named Dilly,
     Dilly-dally Dilly,
      Oh, she is very slow,
     She drags her feet
     Along the street,
      And dilly-dallies so!She's always late to breakfast
   Without a bit of reason,
  For Bridget rings and rings the bell
   And wakes her up in season.Dilly-dally Dilly,
      How can you be so slow?Why don't you try
     To be more spry,
      And not dilly-dally so?'Tis just the same at evening;
   And it's really quite distressing
  To see the time that Dilly wastes
   In dreaming and undressing.Dilly-dally Dilly
      Is always in a huff;
     If you hurry her
     Or worry her
      She says, "There's time enough."Since she's neither sick nor helpless,
   It is quite a serious matter
  That she should be so lazy that
   We still keep scolding at her.Dilly-dally Dilly,
      It's very wrong you know,
     To do no work
     That you can shirk,
      And dilly-dally so.Old "Uncle Jim," of Stonington, Conn., ought to have a whole drawer to
himself, for nothing short of it could express the easy-going enlargement
of his mind in narratives.Uncle Jim was a retired sea captain, sealer,
and whaler, universally beloved and respected for his lovely disposition
and genuine good-heartedness, not less than for the moderation of his
statements and the truthful candor of his narrations.It happened that one
of the Yale Professors, who devoted himself to ethnological studies, was
interested in the Patagonians, and very much desired information as to the
alleged gigantic stature of the race.A scientific friend, who knew the
Stonington romancer, told the Professor that he could no doubt get
valuable information from Uncle Jim, a Captain who was familiar with all
the region about Cape Horn.And the Professor, without any hint about
Uncle Jim's real ability, eagerly accompanied his friend to make the
visit.Uncle Jim was found in one of his usual haunts, and something like
the following ethnological conversation ensued:

Professor--They tell me, Capt.Pennington, that you have been a good deal
in Patagonia.Uncle Jim--Made thirty or forty voyages there, sir.Professor--And I suppose you know something about the Patagonians and
their habits?Uncle Jim--Know all about 'em, sir.Know the Patagonians, sir, all, all of
'em, as well as I know the Stonington folks.Professor--I wanted to ask you, Captain, about the size of the
Patagonians--whether they are giants, as travelers have reported?Uncle Jim--No, sir--shaking his head slowly, and speaking with the modest
tone of indifference--no, sir, they are not.(It was quite probable that
the Captain never had heard the suggestion before).The height of the
Patagonian, sir, is just five feet nine inches and a half.Professor--How did you ascertain this fact, Captain?Uncle Jim--Measured 'em, sir--measured 'em.One day when the mate and I
were ashore down there, I called up a lot of the Patagonians, and the mate
and I measured about 500 of them, and every one of them measured five feet
nine inches and a half--that's their exact height.But, Captain, don't you suppose there
were giants there long ago, in the former generations?Uncle Jim--Not a word of truth in it, sir--not a word.I'd heard that
story and I thought I'd settle it.I satisfied myself there was nothing in
it.Professor--But how could you know that they used not to be giants?Mightn't the former race have been giants?Uncle Jim--Impossible, sir, impossible.Uncle Jim--Dug 'em up, sir--dug 'em up speaking with more than usual
moderation.The next voyage, I took the bo'sen and
went ashore; we dug up 275 old Patagonians and measured 'em.They all
measured exactly five feet nine inches and a half; no difference in
'em--men, women, and all ages just the same.Five feet nine inches and a
half is the natural height of a Patagonian.Not a word of truth in the stories about giants, sir.--_Harper's
Magazine_."Nice child, very nice child," observed an old gentleman, crossing the
aisle and addressing the mother of the boy who had just hit him in the eye
with a wad of paper."None of your business," replied the youngster, taking aim at another
passenger."Fine boy," smiled the old man, as the parent regarded her offspring with
pride.shouted the youngster, with a giggle at his own wit."I thought so," continued the old man, pleasantly."If you had given me
three guesses at it, that would have been the first one I would have
struck on.Now, Puddin', you can blow those things pretty straight, can't
you?"squealed the boy, delighted at the compliment."See me take
that old fellow over there!""Try it on the old woman I
was sitting with.She has boys of her own, and she won't mind.""Can you hit the lady for the gentleman, Johnny?"Johnny drew a bead and landed the pellet on the end of the old woman's
nose.But she did mind it, and, rising in her wrath, soared down on the
small boy like a blizzard.She put him over the line, reversed him, ran
him backward till he didn't know which end of him was front, and finally
dropped him into the lap of the scared mother, with a benediction whereof
the purport was that she'd be back in a moment and skin him alive."She didn't seem to like it, Puddin'," smiled the gentleman, softly."She's a perfect stranger to me, but I understand she is a matron of
truants' home, and I thought she would like a little fun; but I was
mistaken."And the old gentleman sighed sweetly as he went back to his seat.The discovery of the alphabet is at once the triumph, the instrument and
the register of the progress of our race.The oldest abecedarium in
existence is a child's alphabet on a little ink-bottle of black ware found
on the site of Cere, one of the oldest of the Greek settlements in Central
Italy, certainly older than the end of the sixth century B. C. The
Phoenician alphabet has been reconstructed from several hundred
inscriptions.The "Moabite Stone" has yielded the honor of being the most
ancient of alphabetic records to the bronze plates found in Lebanon in
1872, fixed as of the tenth or eleventh century, and therefore the
earliest extant monuments of the Semitic alphabet.The lions of Nineveh
and an inscribed scarab found at Khorsabad have furnished other early
alphabets; while scarabs and cylinders, seals and gems, from Babylon and
Nineveh, with some inscriptions, are the scanty records of the first epoch
of the Phoenician alphabet.For the second period, a sarcophagus found in
1855, with an inscription of twenty-two lines, has tasked the skill of
more than forty of the most eminent Semitic scholars of the day, and the
literature connected with it is overwhelming.An unbroken series of coins
extending over seven centuries from 522 B. C. to 153 A. D., Hebrew
engraved gems, the Siloam inscription discovered in Jerusalem in 1880,
early Jewish coins, have each and all found special students whose
successive progress is fully detailed by Taylor.The Aramaean alphabet
lived only for seven or eight centuries; but from it sprang the scripts of
five great faiths of Asia and the three great literary alphabets of the
East.Nineveh and its public records supply most curious revelations of
the social life and commercial transactions of those primitive times.Loans, leases, notes, sales of houses, slaves, etc., all dated, show the
development of the alphabet.The early Egyptian inscriptions show which
alphabet was there in the reign of Xerxes.Fragments on stone preserved in
old Roman walls in Great Britain, Spain, France, and Jerusalem, all supply
early alphabets.Alphabets have been affected by religious controversies, spread by
missionaries, and preserved in distant regions by holy faith, in spite of
persecution and perversion.The Arabic alphabet, next in importance after
the great Latin alphabet, followed in eighty years the widespread religion
of Mohammed; and now the few Englishmen who can read and speak it are
astonished to learn that it is collaterally related to our own alphabet,
and that both can be traced back to the primitive Phoenician source.Greece alone had forty local alphabets, reduced by careful study to about
half a dozen generic groups, characterized by certain common local
features, and also by political connection.Of the oldest "a, b, c's" found in Italy, several were scribbled by
school-boys on Pompeian walls, six in Greek, four in Oscan, four in Latin;
others were scratched on children's cups, buried with them in their
graves, or cut or painted for practice on unused portions of mortuary
slabs.The earliest was found as late as 1882, a plain vase of black ware
with an Etruscan inscription and a syllabary or spelling exercise, and the
Greek alphabet twice repeated."Pa, I have signed the pledge," said a little boy to his father, on coming
home one evening; "will you help me keep it?""Well, I have brought a copy of the pledge; will you sign it, papa?"What could I do when my brother-officers
called--the father had been in the army--if I was a teetotaler?""Well, you won't ask me to pass the bottle, papa?""You are quite a fanatic, my child; but I promise not to ask you to touch
it."Some weeks after that two officers called in to spend the evening."Have you any more of that prime Scotch ale?""No," said he; "I have not, but I shall get some.Here, Willie, run to the
store, and tell them to send some bottles up."The boy stood before his father respectfully, but did not go."Come, Willie; why, what's the matter?He went, but came
back presently without any bottles."I asked them for it at the store, and they put it upon the counter, but I
could not touch it.don't be angry; I told them to send it up,
but I could not touch it myself!"The father was deeply moved, and turning to his brother-officers, he said:

"Gentlemen, do you hear that?When the ale comes
you may drink it, but not another drop shall be drank in my house, and not
another drop shall pass my lips.Willie, have you your temperance pledge?"And the boy was back with it in a moment.The father signed it and the
little fellow clung round his father's neck with delight.The ale came,
but not one drank, and the bottles stood on the table untouched.Children, sign the pledge, and ask your parents to help you keep it.Don't
touch the bottle, and try to keep others from touching it.Stock Farms FOR SALE; one of the very best in Central Illinois, the

THE PRAIRIE FARMER is the Cheapest and Best Agricultural Paper published.He owned the farm--at least 'twas thought
   He owned, since he lived upon it,--
  And when he came there, with him brought
   The men whom he had hired to run it.He had been bred to city life
   And had acquired a little money;
  But, strange conceit, himself and wife
   Thought farming must be something funny.He did not work himself at all,
   But spent his time in recreation--
  In pitching quoits and playing ball,
   And such mild forms of dissipation.He kept his "rods" and trolling spoons,
   His guns and dogs of various habits,--
  While in the fall he hunted <DW53>s,
   And in the winter skunks and rabbits.His hired help were quick to learn
   The liberties that might be taken,
  And through the season scarce would earn
   The salt it took to save their bacon.He knew no more than child unborn,
   One-half the time, what they were doing,--
  Whether they stuck to hoeing corn,
   Or had on hand some mischief brewing.His crops, although they were but few,
   With proper food were seldom nourished,
  While cockle instead of barley grew,
   And noxious weeds and thistles flourished.His cows in spring looked more like rails
   Set up on legs, than living cattle;
  And when they switched their dried-up tails
   The very bones in them would rattle.At length the sheriff came along,
   Who soon relieved him of his labors.While he became the jest and song
   Of his more enterprising neighbors.Back to the place where life began,
   Back to the home from whence he wandered,
  A sadder, if not a wiser man,
   He went with all his money squandered.On any soil, be it loam or clay,

FRANK DOBB'S WIVES."The great trouble with my son," old Dobb observed to me once, "is that he
is a genius."Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.And the old gentleman sighed and looked with melancholy eyes at the
picture on the genius's easel.It was a clever picture, but everything
Frank Dobb did was clever, from his painting to his banjo playing.Clever
was the true name for it, for of substantial merit it possessed none.He
had begun to paint without learning to draw, and he could pick a tune out
of any musical instrument extant without ever having mastered the
mysteries of notes.He talked the most graceful of airy nothings, and
could not cover a page of note paper without his orthography going lame,
and all the rest of his small acquirements and accomplishments were
proportionately shallow and incomplete.Paternal partiality laid it to his
being too gifted to study, but the cold logic, which no ties of
consanguinity influenced, ascribed it to laziness.Frank was, indeed, the idlest and best-natured fellow in the world.You
never saw him busy, angry, or out of spirits.He painted a little,
thrummed his guitar a little longer or rattled a tune off on his piano,
smoked and read a great deal, and flirted still more, all in the same
deliberate and easy-going way.Any excuse was sufficient to absolve him
from serious work.So he lead a pleasant, useless life, with Dobb senior
to pay the bills.He had the handsomest studio in New York, a studio for one of Ouida's
heroes to luxuriate in.If the encouragement of picturesque surroundings
could have made a painter of him he would have been a master.The fame of
his studio, and the fact that he did not need the money, made his pictures
sell.He was quite a lion in society, and it was regarded as a favor to be
asked to call on him.He was the beau ideal of the artist of romance, and
was accorded a romantic eminence accordingly.So, with his pictures to
provide him with pocket money, and his father to see to the rest, he lived
the life of a young prince, feted and flattered and spoiled, artistically
despised by all the serious workers who knew him, and hated by some who
envied him the commercial success he had no necessity for, but esteemed by
most of us as a good fellow and his own worst enemy.Frank married his first wife while Dobb senior was still at the helm of
his own affairs.She was a charming little woman whose acquaintance he had
made when she visited his studio with a party of friends.She had not a
penny, but he made a draft upon "the governor," as he called him, and the
happy pair digested their honeymoon in Europe.They were absent six
months, during which time he did not set brush to canvas.Then they
returned, as he fancifully termed it, to go to work.He commenced the old life as if he had never been married.The familiar
sound of pipes and beer, and supper after the play, often with young
ladies who had been assisting in the representation on the stage, was
traveled as if there had been no Mrs.Dobb at home in the flat old Dobb
provided.Frank's expenditures on himself were as lavish as they had been
in his bachelor days.As little Brown said, it was lucky that Mrs.Dobb
had a father-in-law to buy her dinner for her.She rarely came to her
husband's studio, because he claimed that it interfered with the course of
business.He had invented a fiction that she was too weak to endure the
strain of society, and so he took her into it as little as possible.In
brief, married by the caprice of a selfish man, the poor little woman
lived through a couple of neglected years, and then died of a malady as
nearly akin to a broken heart as I can think of, while Frank was making a
trip to the Bahamas on the yacht of his friend Munnybagge, of the Stock
Exchange.He had set out on the voyage ostensibly to make studies, for he was a
marine painter, on the principle, probably, that marines are easiest to
paint.When he came back and found his wife dead, he announced that he
would move his studio to Havana for the purpose of improving his art.He
did so, putting off his mourning suit the day after he left New York and
not putting it on again, as the evidence of creditable witnesses on the
steamer and in Havana has long since proved.His son's callousness was a savage stab in old Dobb's heart.A little,
mild-looking old gentleman, without a taint of selfishness or suspicion in
his own nature, he had not seen the effect of his indulgence of him on his
son till his brutal disregard for his first duty as a man had told him of
it.The old man had appreciated and loved his daughter-in-law.In
proportion as he had discovered her unhappiness and its just cause, he had
lost his affection for his son.I hear that there was a terrible scene
when Frank came home, a week after his wife had been buried.He claimed to
have missed the telegram announcing her death to him at Nassau, but
Munnybagge had already told some friends that he had got the dispatch in
time for the steamer, but had remained over till the next one, because he
had a flirtation on hand with little Gonzales, the Cuban heiress, and old
Dobb had heard of it.Munnybagge never took him yachting again; and,
speaking to me once about him, he designated him, not by name, but as
"that infernal bloodless cad."However, as I have said, there was a desperate row between father and son,
and Frank is said to have slunk out of the house like a whipped cur, and
been quite dull company at the supper which he took after the opera that
night in Gillian Trussell's jolly Bohemian flat.When he emigrated, with
his studio traps filling half a dozen packing cases, none of the boys
bothered to see him off.They had learned to see through his good
fellowship, and recalled a poor little phantom, to whose life and
happiness he had been a wicked and bitter enemy.About a year after his departure I read the announcement in the Herald of
the marriage of Franklin D. Dobb, Sr., to a widow well-known and popular
in society.I took the trouble to ascertain that it was Frank's father,
and being among some of the boys that night, mentioned it to them."Well," remarked Smith, "that's really queer.You remember Frank left some
things in my care when he went away?Yesterday I got a letter asking about
them, and informing me that he had got married and was coming home."He did come home, and he settled in his old studio.What sort of a meeting
he had with his father this time I never heard.The old gentleman had been
paying him his allowance regularly while he was away, and I believe he
kept up the payment still.But otherwise he gave him no help, and if he
ever needed help he did now.His wife was a Cuban, as pretty and as helpless as a doll.She had been an
heiress till her brother had turned rebel and had his property
confiscated.Unfortunately for Frank, he had married her before the
culmination of this catastrophe.In fact, he had been paying court to her
with the dispatch announcing his wife's death in his pocket, and had
married her long before the poor little clay was well settled in the grave
he had sent it to.In marrying her he had evidently believed he was
establishing his future.So he was, but it was a future of expiation for
the sins and omissions of his past.Dobb was a tigress in her love and her jealousy.She was
childish and ignorant, and adored her husband as a man and an artist.She
measured his value by her estimation of him, and was on the watch
perpetually for trespassers on her domain.The domestic outbreaks between
the two were positively blood curdling.One afternoon, I remember, Gillian
Trussell, who had heard of his return, called on him.D. met her at
the studio door, told her, "Frank," as she called him, was out; slammed
the door in her face, and then flew at him with a palette scraper.We had
to break the door in, and found him holding her off by both wrists, and
she frothing in a mad fit of hysterics.From that day he was a changed
man.The life the pair lived after that was simply ridiculously miserable.He
had lost his old social popularity, and was forced to sell his pictures to
the cheap dealers, when he was lucky enough to sell them at all.The
paternal allowance would not support the flat they first occupied, and
they went into a boarding house.Inside of a month they were in the
papers, on account of outbreaks on Mrs.Dobb's part against one of the
ladies of the house.A couple of days after he leased a little room
opening into his studio, converted it into a bed-room, and they settled
there for good.Such a housekeeping as it was--like a scene in a farce.The studio had
long since run to seed, and a perpetual odor of something to eat hung over
it along with the sickening reek of the Florida water Mrs.D., like all
other creoles, made more liberal use of than of the pure element it was
half-named from.Crumbs and crusts and chop-bones, which the dog had left,
littered the rugs; and I can not recall the occasion on which the
caterer's tin box was not standing at the door, unless it was when the
dirty plates were piled up, there waiting for him to come for them.Frank had had a savage quarrel with her that day, and
wanted me for a <DW12>.But the scheme availed him nothing, for she broke
out over the soup and I left them to fight it out, and finished my feast
at a chop house.All of his old flirtations came back to curse him now.His light loves of
the playhouse and his innocent devotions of the ball room were alike the
instruments fate had forged into those of punishment for him.The very
names of his old fancies, which, with that subtle instinct all women
possess, she had found out, were sufficient to send his wife into a
frenzy.She was a chronic theatre-goer, and they never went to the theatre
without bringing a quarrel home with them.If he was silent at the play
she charged him with neglecting her; if he brisked up and tried to chat,
her jealousy would soon pick out some casus belli in the small talk he
strove to interest her with.A word to a passing friend, a glance at one
of her own sex, was sufficient to set her going.I shall never question
that jealousy is a form of actual madness, after what I saw of it in the
lives of that miserable man and woman.A year after his return he was the ghost of his old self.He was haggard
and often unshaven; his attire was shabby and carelessly put on; he had
lost his old, jaunty air, and went by you with a hurried pace, and his
head and shoulders bent with an indescribable suggestion of humility.The
fear of having her break out, regardless of any one who might be by, which
hung over him at home, haunted him out of doors, too.Dobb the first had broken his spirit as effectually as he had broken Mrs.Smith occupied the next studio to him, and one evening I was
smoking there, when an atrocious uproar commenced in the next room.We
could distinguish Frank's voice and his wife's, and another strange one.Smith looked at me, grinned, and shrugged his shoulders.The disturbance
ceased in a couple of minutes, and a door banged.Then came a crash, a shrill and furious scream, and the sound of feet.We
ran to the door, in time to see Mrs.Dobb, her hair in a tangle down her
back, in a dirty wrapper and slipshod slippers, stumbling down stairs.We
posted after her, Smith nearly breaking his neck by tripping over one of
the slippers which she had shed as she ran.The theatres were just out and
the streets full of people, among whom she jostled her way like the mad
woman that she was.We came up with her as she overtook her husband, who
was walking with McGilp, the dealer who handled his pictures.She seized
him by the arm and screamed out:

"I told you I would come with you."His face for a moment was the face of a devil, full of fury and despair.I
saw his fist clench itself and the big vein in his forehead swell.But he
slipped his hands into his pockets, looked appealingly at McGilp, and
said, shrugging his shoulders, "You see how it is, Mac?"McGilp nodded and walked abruptly away, with a look full of contempt and
scorn.We mingled with the crowd and saw the poor wretches go off
together, he grim and silent, she hysterically excited--with all the world
staring at them.Smith slept on a lounge in my room that night."I
couldn't get a wink up there," he said, "and I don't want to be even the
ear witness of a murder."The night did not witness the tragedy he anticipated, though.Next day,
Frank Dobb came to see me--a compliment he had not paid me for months.He
was the incarnation of abject misery, and so nervous that he could
scarcely speak intelligibly."I saw you in the crowd last night, old man," he said, looking at the
floor and twisting and untwisting his fingers.A
nice life for a fellow to lead, eh?"What else could I reply than, "Why do you lead it then?"he repeated, breaking into a hollow, uneasy laugh."Why, because I
love her, damn me!"Is this what you came to tell me?""No," he answered, "of course not.The fact is, I want you to help me out
of a hole.That row last night has settled me with McGilp.He came to see
me about a lot of pictures for a sale he is getting up out West, and the
senora kept up such a nagging that he got sick and suggested that we
should go to 'The Studio' for a chop and settle the business there.She
swore I shouldn't go, and that she would follow us if I did.I thought
she'd not go that far; but she did.So the McGilp affair is off for good,
I know.He's disgusted, and I don't blame him.Buy that Hoguet you wanted last year."The picture was one I had fancied and offered him a price for in his palmy
days, one that he had picked up abroad.I was only too glad to take it and
a couple more, for which I paid him at once; and next evening, at dinner,
I heard that he had levanted."Walked out this morning," said Smith, "and
sent a messenger an hour after with word that he had already left the
city.She came in to me with the letter in one hand and a dagger in the
other.She swears he has run away with another woman, and says she's going
to have her life, if she has to follow her around the world."She did not carry out her sanguinary purpose, though.There were some
consultations with old Dobb and then the studio was to let again.Some one
told me she had returned to Cuba, where she proposed to live on the
allowance her father-in-law had made her husband and which he now
continued to her.I had almost forgotten her when, several years later, in the lobby of the
Academy of Music, she touched my arm with her fan.She was promenading on
the arm of a handsome but beefy-looking Englishman, whom she introduced to
me as her husband.I had not heard of a divorce, but I took the
introduction as information that there had been one.The Englishman was a
better fellow than he looked.We supped together after the opera, and I
learned that he had met Mrs.Dobb in Havana, where he had spent some years
in business.I found her a changed woman--a new woman, indeed, in whom I
only now and then caught a glimpse of her old indolent, babyish and
foolish self.She was not only prettier than ever, but she had become a
sensible and clever woman.The influence of an intelligent man, who was
strong enough to bend her to his ways, had developed her latent brightness
and taught her to respect herself as well as him.I met her several times after that, and at the last meeting but one she
spoke of Frank for the first time.Her black eyes snapped when she uttered
his name.The devil was alive in them, though love was dead.I told her that I had heard nothing of him since his disappearance."But I have," she said, showing her white teeth in a curious smile.she went on bitterly; "and to think I could ever have loved
such a thing as he!X., that I never knew he had been
married till after he had fled?Then his father told me how he had courted
my father's money, with his wife lying dead at home.Before I heard that, I wanted to kill the woman who had
stolen you from me.The moment after I could have struck you dead at my
feet."She threw her arm up, holding her fan like a dagger.I believed her, and
so would any one who had seen her then."I had hardly settled in Havana," she continued, "before I received a
letter from him.Had the other woman
tired of him already?I asked myself, or was it really true, as his father
had told me, that he had fled alone?I answered the letter, and he wrote
again.Again I answered, and so it was kept up.For two years I played
with the love I now knew was worthless.He was traveling round the world,
and a dozen times wanted to come directly to me.I insisted that he should
keep his journey up--as a probation, you see.The exultation with which she told this was absolutely fiendish.I could
see in it, plainer than any words could tell it to me, the scheme of
vengeance she had carried out, the alternating hopes and torments to which
she had raised, and into which she had plunged him.I could see him
wandering around the globe, scourged by remorses, agonized by doubts, and
maddened by despairs, accepting the lies she wrote him as inviolable
pledges, and sustaining himself with the vision of a future never to be
fulfilled.She read the expression of my face, and laughed.And again she stabbed the air with her fan."But--pardon me the question--but you have begun the confidence," I said."I had been divorced while I was writing to him.A year ago he was to be
in London, where I was to meet him.While he was sailing from the Cape of
Good Hope I was being married to a man who loved me for myself, and to
whom I had confided all.Instead of my address at the London post office
he received a notification of my marriage, addressed to him in my own hand
and mailed to him by myself.He wrote once or twice still, but my husband
indorsed the letters with his own name and returned them unopened.He may
be dead for all I know, but I hope and pray he is still alive, and will
remain alive and love me for a thousand years."She opened her arms, as if to hug her vengeance to her heart, and looked
at me steadily with eyes that thrilled me with their lambent fire.No
wonder the wretched vagabond loved her!What a doom his selfishness and
his duplicity had invoked upon him!I believe if he could have seen her as
I saw her then, so different from and better than he knew her to be, he
would have gone mad on the spot.Dobb the first was indeed
avenged.We sipped our chocolate and talked of other things, as if such a being as
Frank Dobb had never been.Her husband joined us and we made an evening of
it at the theatre.I knew from the way he looked at me, and from the
increased warmth of his manner, that he was conversant with his wife's
having made a confidant of me.But I do not think he knew how far her
confidence had gone.I have often wondered since if he knew how deep and
fierce the hatred she carried for his predecessor was.There are things
women will reveal to strangers which they will die rather than divulge to
those they love.I saw them off to Europe, for they were going to establish themselves in
London, and I have never seen or directly heard from them since.But some
months after their departure I received a letter from Robinson, who has
been painting there ever since his picture made that great hit in the
Salon of '7--."I have odd news for you," he wrote."You remember Frank Dobb, who
belonged to our old Pen and Pencil Club, and who ran away from that Cuban
wife of his just before I left home?Well, about a year ago I met him in
Fleet street, the shabbiest beggar you ever saw.He was quite tight and
smelled of gin across the street.He was taking a couple of drawings to a
penny dreadful office which he was making pictures for at ten shillings a
piece.I went to see him once, in the dismalest street back of Drury Lane.He was doing some painting for a dealer, when he was sober enough, and of
all the holes you ever saw his was it.I soon had to sit down on him, for
he got into the habit of coming to see me and loafing around, making the
studio smell like a pub, till I would lend him five shillings to go away.I heard nothing of him till the other day I came across an event which
this from the Telegraph will explain."The following newspaper paragraph was appended:

"The man who shot himself on the door-step of Mr.Bennerley Green, the
West India merchant, last Monday, has been discovered to be an American
who for some time has been employed furnishing illustrations to the lower
order of publications here.He was known as Allan, but this is said to
have been an assumed name.He is stated to be the son of a wealthy New
Yorker, who discarded him in consequence of his habits of dissipation, and
to have once been an artist of considerable prominence in the United
States.All that is known of the suicide is the story told by the servant,
who a few minutes after admitting his master and mistress upon their
return from the theatre, heard the report of a pistol in the street, and
on opening the door found the wretched man dead upon the step.The body
was buried after the inquest at the charge of the eminent American artist,
Mr.J. J. Robinson, A. R. A., who had known him in his better days."Bennerley Green, the West
India merchant.--_The Continent._

CONSUMPTION CURED.An old physician, retired from practice, having had placed in his hands by
an East India missionary the formula of a simple vegetable remedy for the
speedy and permanent cure of Consumption, Bronchitis, Catarrh, Asthma and
all throat and Lung Affections, also a positive and radical cure for
Nervous Debility and all Nervous Complaints, after having tested its
wonderful curative powers in thousands of cases, has felt it his duty to
make it known to his suffering fellows.Actuated by this motive and a
desire to relieve human suffering, I will send free of charge, to all who
desire it, this recipe, in German, French, or English, with full
directions for preparing and using.Sent by mail by addressing with stamp,

Many cures for snoring have been invented, but none have stood the test so
well as the old reliable clothes-pin.A Clergyman says that the baby that pulls whiskers, bites fingers, and
grabs for everything it sees has in it the elements of a successful
politician.A Hartford man has a Bible bearing date 1599.It is very easy to preserve
a Bible for a great many years, because--because--well, we don't know what
the reason is, but it is so, nevertheless.A Vermont man has a hen thirty years old.The other day a hawk stole it,
but after an hour came back with a broken bill and three claws gone, put
down the hen and took an old rubber boot in place of it.Alexander Gumbleton Ruffleton Scufflton Oborda Whittleton Sothenhall
Benjaman Franklin Squires is still a resident of North Carolina, aged
ninety-two.The census taker always thinks at first that the old man is
guying.A little five-year-old friend, who was always allowed to choose the
prettiest kitten for his pet and playmate before the other nurslings were
drowned, was taken to his mother's sick room the other morning to see the
two tiny new twin babes.He looked reflectively from one to the other for
a minute or two, then, poking his chubby finger into the plumpest baby, he
said decidedly, "Save this one."In promulgating your esoteric cogitation on articulating superficial
sentimentalities and philosophical psychological observation, beware of
platitudinous ponderosity.Let your conversation possess a clarified
conciseness, compact comprehensiveness, coalescent consistency, and a
concatenated cognancy; eschew all conglomerations of flatulent garrulity
and jejune babblement.In other words, don't use such big words.A boy once took it in his head
  That he would exercise his sled.He took the sled into the road
  And, lord a massy!And as he slid, he laughing cried,
  "What fun upon my sled to slide."And as he laughed, before he knewed,
  He from that sliding sled was slude.Upon the slab where he was laid
  They carved this line: "This boy was sleighed.""A Farmer's Wife" wants to know if we can recommend anything to destroy

FIFE WHEAT

It is the best wheat I ever raised or saw.I sowed one quart and got from
it three bushels of beautiful wheat weighing 63 pounds to the bushel,
which took the first premium at our county fair.I have been offered $15 a
bushel for my seed, but would not part with a handful of it.If I could
not get more like it, I would not sell the three bushels I raised from the
quart for $100.STEABNER, Sorlien's Mill, Yellow Medicine Co., Minn.Farmers, if you want to know more of this wheat, write to

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Prairie Farmer, Vol.Benny says there ain't any man alive good enough for his Aunt Maggie,
so if Mr.Fulton gets to being too highheaded sometimes, you can tell
him what Benny says.But we're all real pleased, honestly, Maggie, and of course we're
terribly excited.We're so sorry you're going to be married out there
in Chicago.Why can't you make him come to Hillerton?Jane says she'd
be glad to make a real nice wedding for you--and when Jane says a thing
like that, you can know how much she's really saying, for Jane's
feeling awfully poor these days, since they lost all that money, you
know.Fulton, too--"Cousin Stanley," as Hattie
always calls him.Please give him our congratulations--but there, that
sounds funny, doesn't it?(But the etiquette editors in the magazines
say we must always give best wishes to the bride and congratulations to
the groom.)Only it seems funny here, to congratulate that rich Mr.I didn't mean it that way, Maggie.I
declare, if that sentence wasn't 'way in the middle of this third page,
and so awfully hard for me to write, anyway, I'd tear up this sheet and
begin another.But, after all, you'll understand, I'm sure.You KNOW we
all think the world of you, Maggie, and that I didn't mean anything
against YOU.Fulton is--is such a big man, and
all--But you know what I meant.Well, anyway, if you can't come here to be married, we hope you'll
bring him here soon so we can see him, and see you, too.We miss you
awfully, Maggie,--truly we do, especially since Jim's folks went, and
with Mr.Smith gone, too, Jane and I are real lonesome.Jim and Hattie like real well where they are.They've got a real pretty
home, and they're the biggest folks in town, so Hattie doesn't have to
worry for fear she won't live quite so fine as her neighbors--though
really I think Hattie's got over that now a good deal.That awful thing
of Fred's sobered her a lot, and taught her who her real friends were,
and that money ain't everything.Fred is doing splendidly now, just as steady as a clock.It does my
soul good to see him and his father together.And Bessie--she isn't near so disagreeable and airy as she was.Hattie
took her out of that school and put her into another where she's
getting some real learning and less society and frills and dancing.Jim
is doing well, and I think Hattie's real happy.Oh, of course, when we
first heard that Mr.Fulton had got back, I think she was kind of
disappointed.You know she always did insist we were going to have the
rest of that money if he didn't show up.But she told me just
Thanksgiving Day that she didn't know but 't was just as well, after
all, that they didn't have the money, for maybe Fred'd go wrong again,
or it would strike Benny this time.Anyhow, however much money she had,
she said, she'd never let her children spend so much again, and she'd
found out money didn't bring happiness, always, anyway.Mellicent and Donald are going to be married next summer.Donald don't
get a very big salary yet, but Mellicent says she won't mind a bit
going back to economizing again, now that for once she's had all the
chocolates and pink dresses she wanted.What a funny girl she is--but
she's a dear girl, just the same, and she's settled down real sensible
now.She and Donald are as happy as can be, and even Jane likes Donald
real well now.Jane's gone back to her tidies and aprons and skimping on everything.She says she's got to, to make up that forty thousand dollars.But she
enjoys it, I believe.Honestly, she acts'most as happy trying to save
five cents as Frank does earning it in his old place behind the
counter.And that's saying a whole lot, as you know.Jane knows very
well she doesn't have to pinch that way.They've got lots of the money
left, and Frank's business is better than ever.You complain because I don't tell you anything about myself in my
letters, but there isn't anything to tell.I am well and happy, and
I've just thought up the nicest thing to do.Mary Hicks came home from
Boston sick last September, and she's been here at my house ever since.Her own home ain't no place for a sick person, you know, with all those
children, and they're awfully poor, too.She works in a department store and was all
played out, but she's picked up wonderfully here and is going back next
week.Well, she was telling me about a girl that works with her at the same
counter, and saying how she wished she had a place like this to go to
for a rest and change, so I'm going to do it--give them one, I mean,
she and the other girls.Mary says there are a dozen girls that she
knows right there that are half-sick, but would get well in a minute if
they only had a few weeks of rest and quiet and good food.So I'm going
to take them, two at a time, so they'll be company for each other.Mary
is going to fix it up for me down there, and pick out the girls, and
she says she knows the man who owns the store will be glad to let them
off, for they are all good help, and he's been afraid he'd lose them.He'd offered them a month off, besides their vacation, but they
couldn't take it, because they didn't have any place to go or money to
pay.Of course, that part will be all right now.And I'm so glad and
excited I don't know what to do.Oh, I do hope you'll tell Mr.Fulton
some time how happy he's made me, and how perfectly splendid that
money's been for me.Well, Maggie, this is a long letter, and I must close.Tell me all
about the new clothes you are getting, and I hope you will get a lot.Lovingly yours,

FLORA.Maggie Duff, for pity's sake, never, never tell that man
that I ever went into mourning for him and put flowers before his
picture.Fulton folded the letter and handed
it back to Miss Maggie."I didn't feel that I was betraying confidences--under the
circumstances," murmured Miss Maggie."And there was a good deal in the letter that I DID want you to see,"
added Miss Maggie."Hm-m; the congratulations, for one thing, of course," twinkled the
man."I wanted you to see how really, in the end, that money was not doing
so much harm, after all," asserted Miss Maggie, with some dignity,
shaking her head at him reprovingly."I thought you'd be GLAD, sir!"I'm so glad that, when I come to make my will now, I
shouldn't wonder if I remembered them all again--a little--that is, if
I have anything left to will," he teased shamelessly."Oh, by the way,
that makes me think.I've just been putting up a monument to John
Smith.""But, my dear Maggie, something was due the man," maintained Fulton,
reaching for a small flat parcel near him and placing it in Miss
Maggie's hands."But--oh, Stanley, how could you?"she shivered, her eyes on the words
the millionaire had penciled on the brown paper covering of the parcel.With obvious reluctance Miss Maggie loosened the paper covers and
peered within.In her hands lay a handsome brown leather volume with gold letters,
reading:--

     The Blaisdell Family
           By
        John Smith

"And you--did that?"I shall send a copy each to Frank and Jim and Miss Flora, of
course.Poor
man, it's the least I can do for him--and the most--unless--" He
hesitated with an unmistakable look of embarrassment."Well, unless--I let you take me to Hillerton one of these days and see
if--if Stanley G. Fulton, with your gracious help, can make peace for
John Smith with those--er--cousins of mine.You see, I still feel
confoundedly like that small boy at the keyhole, and I'd like--to open
that door!And, oh, Stanley, it's the one thing needed
to make me perfectly happy," she sighed blissfully.THE END









End of Project Gutenberg's Oh, Money!He is
     liberal only in measures which do not interfere with his
     prerogative."It was inevitable that the present sort of trouble should arise.The Controllers had got the finances in good order, and were
     bound to look to the welfare of the people, which could only be
     done by the curtailment of Tewfik's power.The present
     arrangement of Controllers and Consul-Generals is defective.The
     Consul-Generals are charged with the duty of seeing that the
     country is quiet and the people well treated.They are
     responsible to their Foreign Offices.The Controllers are charged
     with the finances and the welfare of the country, but to whom
     are they responsible?Not to Tewfik; though he pays them, he
     cannot remove them; yet they must get on well with him.Not to
     the Foreign Office, for it is repeatedly said that they are
     Egyptian officials, yet they have to keep on good terms with
     these Foreign Offices.Not to the bondholders, though they are
     bound, considering their power, to be on good terms with them.Not to the inhabitants of Egypt, though these latter are taught
     to believe that every unpopular act is done by the Controllers'
     advice."The only remedy is by the formation of a Council of Notables,
     having direct access to Tewfik, and independent of his or of the
     Ministers' goodwill, and the subjection of the Controllers to the
     Consul-Generals responsible to the Foreign Office--in fact,
     Residents at the Court.This would be no innovation, for the
     supervision exists now, except under the Controllers and
     Consul-Generals.It is simply proposed to amalgamate Controllers
     with Consul-Generals, and to give these latter the position of
     Residents.By this means the continual change of French
     Consul-Generals would be avoided, and the consequent ill-feeling
     between France and England would disappear.Should the Residents
     fall out, the matter would be easily settled by the Governments.As it is at present, a quadruple combat goes on; sometimes it is
     one Consul-General against the other Consul-General, aided by the
     two Controllers, or a Consul-General and one Controller against
     the other Consul-General and the other Controller, in all of
     which combats Tewfik gains and the people lose."One thing should certainly be done--the giving of concessions
     ought not to be in the power of Controllers, nor if
     Consul-Generals are amalgamated with Controllers as Residents
     should these Residents have this power.It ought to be exercised
     by the Council of Notables, who would look to the welfare of the
     people."The progress of events in Lower Egypt during 1881 and 1882 was watched
with great care, whether he was vegetating in the Mauritius or
absorbed in the anxieties and labours of his South African mission.Commenting on the downfall of Arabi, he explained how the despatch of
troops to the Soudan, composed of regiments tainted with a spirit of
insubordination, would inevitably aggravate the situation there.Later
on, in 1883, when he heard of Hicks being sent to take the command and
repair the defeat of Yusuf, he wrote:--"Unless Hicks is given supreme
command he is lost; it can never work putting him in a subordinate
position.Hicks must be made Governor-General, otherwise he will never
end things satisfactorily."At the same time, he came to the
conclusion that there was only one man who could save Egypt, and that
was Nubar Pasha.He wrote:--"If they do not make Nubar Pasha Prime
Minister or Regent in Egypt they will have trouble, as he is the only
man who can rule that country."This testimony to Nubar's capacity is
the more remarkable and creditable, as in earlier days Gordon had not
appreciated the merit of a statesman who has done more for Egypt than
any other of his generation.But at a very early stage of the Soudan
troubles Gordon convinced himself that the radical cause of these
difficulties and misfortunes was not the shortcomings and errors of
any particular subordinate, but the complete want of a definite policy
on the part, not of the Khedive and his advisers, but of the British
Government itself.He wrote on this point to a friend (2nd September
1883), almost the day that Hicks was to march from Khartoum:--

     "Her Majesty's Government, right or wrong, will not take a
     decided step _in re_ Egypt and the Soudan; they drift, but at the
     same time cannot avoid the _onus_ of being the real power in
     Egypt, with the corresponding advantage of being so.It is
     undoubtedly the fact that they maintain Tewfik and the Pashas in
     power against the will of the people; this alone is insufferable
     from disgusting the people, to whom also Her Majesty's Government
     have given no inducement to make themselves popular.Their
     present action is a dangerous one, for without any advantage over
     the Canal or to England, they keep a running sore open with
     France, and are acting in a way which will justify Russia to act
     in a similar way in Armenia, and Austria in Salonica.Further
     than that, Her Majesty's Government must eventually gain the
     odium which will fall upon them when the interest of the debt
     fails to be paid, which will soon be the case.Also, Her
     Majesty's Government cannot possibly avoid the responsibility for
     the state of affairs in the Soudan, where a wretched war drags on
     in a ruined country at a cost of half a million per annum at
     least.I say therefore to avoid all this, _if Her Majesty's
     Government will not act firmly and strongly and take the country_
     (which, if I were they, I would not do), let them attempt to get
     the Palestine Canal made, and quit Egypt to work out its own
     salvation.In doing so lots of anarchy will take place.This
     anarchy is inseparable from a peaceful solution; it is the
     travail in birth.Her Majesty's Government do not prevent anarchy
     now; therefore better leave the country, and thus avoid a
     responsibility which gives no advantage, and is mean and
     dangerous."In a letter to myself, dated 3rd January 1884, from Brussels, he
enters into some detail on matters that had been forgotten or were
insufficiently appreciated, to which the reported appointment of
Zebehr to proceed to the Soudan and stem the Mahdi's advance lent
special interest:--

     "I send you a small note which you can make use of, but I beg you
     will not let my name appear under any circumstances.When in
     London I had printed a pamphlet in Arabic, with all the papers
     (official) concerning Zebehr Pasha and his action in pushing his
     son to rebel.It is not long,
     and would repay translating and publishing.It has all the
     history and the authentic letters found in the divan of Zebehr's
     son when Gessi took his stockade.It is in a cover, blue and
     gold.It was my address to people of Soudan--Apologia.Isaiah
     XIX.19, 20, 21 has a wonderful prophecy about Egypt and the
     saviour who will come from the frontier."The note enclosed was published in _The Times_ of 5th January, and
read as follows:--

     "A correspondent writes that it may seem inexplicable why the
     Mahdi's troops attacked Gezireh, which, as its name signifies, is
     an isle near Berber, but there is an old tradition that the
     future ruler of the Soudan will be from that isle.Zebehr Rahama
     knew this, but he fell on leaving his boat at this isle, and so,
     though the Soudan people looked on him as a likely saviour, this
     omen shook their confidence in him.He was then on his way to
     Cairo after swearing his people to rebel (if he was retained
     there), under a tree at Shaka.Zebehr will most probably be taken
     prisoner by the Mahdi, and will then take the command of the
     Mahdi's forces.The peoples of the Soudan are very superstitious,
     and the fall of the flag by a gust of wind, on the proclamation
     of Tewfik at Khartoum, was looked on as an omen of the end of
     Mehemet Ali's dynasty.There is an old tree opposite Cook's
     office at Jerusalem in Toppet, belonging to an old family, and
     protected by Sultan's Firman, which the Arabs consider will fall
     when the Sultan's rule ends.It lost a large limb during the
     Turco-Russian war, and is now in a decayed state.There can be no
     doubt but that the movement will spread into Palestine, Syria,
     and Hedjaz.At Damascus already proclamations have been posted
     up, denouncing Turks and Circassians, and this was before Hicks
     was defeated.It is the beginning of the end of Turkey.Austria
     backed by Germany will go to Salonica, quieting Russia by letting
     her go into Armenia--England and France neutralising one another."If not too late, the return of the ex-Khedive Ismail to Egypt,
     and the union of England and France to support and control the
     Arab movement, appears the only chance.Ismail would soon come to
     terms with the Soudan, the rebellion of which countries was
     entirely due to the oppression of the Turks and Circassians."These expressions of opinion about Egypt and the Soudan may be said to
have culminated in the remarkable pronouncement Gordon made to Mr W.
T. Stead, the brilliant editor of the _Pall Mall Gazette_, on 8th
January 1884, which appeared in his paper on the following day.The
substance of that statement is as follows:--

     "So you would abandon the Soudan?But the Eastern Soudan is
     indispensable to Egypt.It will cost you far more to retain your
     hold upon Egypt proper if you abandon your hold of the Eastern
     Soudan to the Mahdi or to the Turk than what it would to retain
     your hold upon Eastern Soudan by the aid of such material as
     exists in the provinces.Darfour and Kordofan must be abandoned.That I admit; but the provinces lying to the east of the White
     Nile should be retained, and north of Sennaar.The danger to be
     feared is not that the Mahdi will march northward through Wady
     Halfa; on the contrary, it is very improbable that he will ever
     go so far north.It arises from the influence which the spectacle of a conquering
     Mahommedan Power established close to your frontiers will
     exercise upon the population which you govern.In all the cities
     in Egypt it will be felt that what the Mahdi has done they may
     do; and, as he has driven out the intruder and the infidel, they
     may do the same.Nor is it only England that has to face this
     danger.The success of the Mahdi has already excited dangerous
     fermentation in Arabia and Syria.Placards have been posted in
     Damascus calling upon the population to rise and drive out the
     Turks.If the whole of the Eastern Soudan is surrendered to the
     Mahdi, the Arab tribes on both sides of the Red Sea will take
     fire.In self-defence the Turks are bound to do something to cope
     with so formidable a danger, for it is quite possible that if
     nothing is done the whole of the Eastern Question may be reopened
     by the triumph of the Mahdi.I see it is proposed to fortify Wady
     Halfa, and prepare there to resist the Mahdi's attack.You might
     as well fortify against a fever.Contagion of that kind cannot be
     kept out by fortifications and garrisons.But that it is real,
     and that it does exist, will be denied by no one cognisant with
     Egypt and the East.In self-defence the policy of evacuation
     cannot possibly be justified.You have 6000 men in
     Khartoum.You have garrisons
     in Darfour, in Bahr el Gazelle, and Gondokoro.Are they to be
     sacrificed?Their only offence is their loyalty to their
     Sovereign.For their fidelity you are going to abandon them to
     their fate.You say they are to retire upon Wady Halfa.But
     Gondokoro is 1500 miles from Khartoum, and Khartoum is only 350
     from Wady Halfa.How will you move your 6000 men from
     Khartoum--to say nothing of other places--and all the Europeans
     in that city through the desert to Wady Halfa?Where are you
     going to get the camels to take them away?Will the Mahdi supply
     them?If they are to escape with their lives, the garrison will
     not be allowed to leave with a coat on their backs.They will be
     plundered to the skin, and even then their lives may not be
     spared.Whatever you may decide about evacuation, you cannot
     evacuate, because your army cannot be moved.You must either
     surrender absolutely to the Mahdi or defend Khartoum at all
     hazards.The latter is the only course which ought to be
     entertained.The Mahdi's
     forces will fall to pieces of themselves; but if in a moment of
     panic orders are issued for the abandonment of the whole of the
     Eastern Soudan, a blow will be struck against the security of
     Egypt and the peace of the East, which may have fatal
     consequences."The great evil is not at Khartoum, but at Cairo.It is the
     weakness of Cairo which produces disaster in the Soudan.It is
     because Hicks was not adequately supported at the first, but was
     thrust forward upon an impossible enterprise by the men who had
     refused him supplies when a decisive blow might have been struck,
     that the Western Soudan has been sacrificed.The Eastern Soudan
     may, however, be saved if there is a firm hand placed at the helm
     in Egypt."What then, you ask, should be done?I reply, Place Nubar in
     power!Nubar is the one supremely able man among Egyptian
     Ministers.He is proof against foreign intrigue, and he
     thoroughly understands the situation.Place him in power; support
     him through thick and thin; give him a free hand; and let it be
     distinctly understood that no intrigues, either on the part of
     Tewfik or any of Nubar's rivals, will be allowed for a moment to
     interfere with the execution of his plans.You are sure to find
     that the energetic support of Nubar will, sooner or later, bring
     you into collision with the Khedive; but if that Sovereign really
     desires, as he says, the welfare of his country, it will be
     necessary for you to protect Nubar's Administration from any
     direct or indirect interference on his part.Nubar can be
     depended upon: that I can guarantee.He will not take office
     without knowing that he is to have his own way; but if he takes
     office, it is the best security that you can have for the
     restoration of order to the country.Especially is this the case
     with the Soudan.Nubar should be left untrammelled by any
     stipulations concerning the evacuation of Khartoum.There is no
     hurry.The garrisons can hold their own at present.Let them
     continue to hold on until disunion and tribal jealousies have
     worked their natural results in the camp of the Mahdi.Nubar
     should be free to deal with the Soudan in his own way.How he
     will deal with the Soudan, of course, I cannot profess to say;
     but I should imagine that he would appoint a Governor-General at
     Khartoum, with full powers, and furnish him with two millions
     sterling--a large sum, no doubt, but a sum which had much better
     be spent now than wasted in a vain attempt to avert the
     consequences of an ill-timed surrender.Sir Samuel Baker, who
     possesses the essential energy and single tongue requisite for
     the office, might be appointed Governor-General of the Soudan,
     and he might take his brother as Commander-in-Chief."It should be proclaimed in the hearing of all the Soudanese, and
     engraved on tablets of brass, that a permanent Constitution was
     granted to the Soudanese, by which no Turk or Circassian would
     ever be allowed to enter the province to plunder its inhabitants
     in order to fill his own pockets, and that no immediate
     emancipation of slaves would be attempted.Immediate emancipation
     was denounced in 1833 as confiscation in England, and it is no
     less confiscation in the Soudan to-day.Whatever is done in that
     direction should be done gradually, and by a process of
     registration.Mixed tribunals might be established, if Nubar
     thought fit, in which European judges would co-operate with the
     natives in the administration of justice.Police inspectors also
     might be appointed, and adequate measures taken to root out the
     abuses which prevail in the prisons."With regard to Darfour, I should think that Nubar would probably
     send back the family and the heir of the Sultan of Darfour.If
     subsidized by the Government, and sent back with Sir Samuel
     Baker, he would not have much difficulty in regaining possession
     of the kingdom of Darfour, which was formerly one of the best
     governed of African countries.As regards Abyssinia, the old
     warning should not be lost sight of--"Put not your trust in
     princes"; and place no reliance upon the King of Abyssinia, at
     least outside his own country.Zeylah and Bogos might be ceded to
     him with advantage, and the free right of entry by the port of
     Massowah might be added; but it would be a mistake to give him
     possession of Massowah which he would ruin.A Commission might
     also be sent down with advantage to examine the state of things
     in Harrar, opposite Aden, and see what iniquities are going on
     there, as also at Berbera and Zeylah.By these means, and by the
     adoption of a steady, consistent policy at headquarters, it would
     be possible--not to say easy--to re-establish the authority of
     the Khedive between the Red Sea and Sennaar."As to the cost of the Soudan, it is a mistake to suppose that it
     will necessarily be a charge on the Egyptian Exchequer.It will
     cost two millions to relieve the garrisons and to quell the
     revolt; but that expenditure must be incurred any way; and in all
     probability, if the garrisons are handed over to be massacred and
     the country evacuated, the ultimate expenditure would exceed that
     sum.At first, until the country is pacified, the Soudan will
     need a subsidy of L200,000 a year from Egypt.That, however,
     would be temporary.During the last years of my administration
     the Soudan involved no charge upon the Egyptian Exchequer.The
     bad provinces were balanced against the good, and an equilibrium
     was established.The Soudan will never be a source of revenue to
     Egypt, but it need not be a source of expense.That deficits have
     arisen, and that the present disaster has occurred, is entirely
     attributable to a single cause, and that is, the grossest
     misgovernment."The cause of the rising in the Soudan is the cause of all
     popular risings against Turkish rule, wherever they have
     occurred.No one who has been in a Turkish province, and has
     witnessed the results of the Bashi-Bazouk system, which excited
     so much indignation some time ago in Bulgaria, will need to be
     told why the people of the Soudan have risen in revolt against
     the Khedive.The Turks, the Circassians, and the Bashi-Bazouks
     have plundered and oppressed the people in the Soudan, as they
     plundered and oppressed them in the Balkan peninsula.Oppression
     begat discontent; discontent necessitated an increase of the
     armed force at the disposal of the authorities; this increase of
     the army force involved an increase of expenditure, which again
     was attempted to be met by increasing taxation, and that still
     further increased the discontent.And so things went on in a
     dismal circle, until they culminated, after repeated deficits, in
     a disastrous rebellion.That the people were justified in
     rebelling, nobody who knows the treatment to which they were
     subjected will attempt to deny.Their cries were absolutely
     unheeded at Cairo.In despair, they had recourse to the only
     method by which they could make their wrongs known; and, on the
     same principle that Absalom fired the corn of Joab, so they
     rallied round the Mahdi, who exhorted them to revolt against the
     Turkish yoke.I am convinced that it is an entire mistake to
     regard the Mahdi as in any sense a religious leader: he
     personifies popular discontent.All the Soudanese are potential
     Mahdis, just as all the Egyptians are potential Arabis.The
     movement is not religious, but an outbreak of despair.Three
     times over I warned the late Khedive that it would be impossible
     to govern the Soudan on the old system, after my appointment to
     the Governor-Generalship.During the three years that I wielded
     full powers in the Soudan, I taught the natives that they had a
     right to exist.I waged war against the Turks and Circassians,
     who had harried the population.I had taught them something of
     the meaning of liberty and justice, and accustomed them to a
     higher ideal of government than that with which they had
     previously been acquainted.As soon as I had gone, the Turks and
     Circassians returned in full force; the old Bashi-Bazouk system
     was re-established; my old _employes_ were persecuted; and a
     population which had begun to appreciate something like decent
     government was flung back to suffer the worst excesses of Turkish
     rule.The inevitable result followed; and thus it may be said
     that the egg of the present rebellion was laid in the three years
     during which I was allowed to govern the Soudan on other than
     Turkish principles."The Soudanese are a very nice people.They deserve the sincere
     compassion and sympathy of all civilised men.I got on very well
     with them, and I am sincerely sorry at the prospect of seeing
     them handed over to be ground down once more by their Turkish and
     Circassian oppressors.Yet, unless an attempt is made to hold on
     to the present garrisons, it is inevitable that the Turks, for
     the sake of self-preservation, must attempt to crush them.They
     deserve a better fate.It ought not to be impossible to come to
     terms with them, to grant them a free amnesty for the past, to
     offer them security for decent government in the future.If this
     were done, and the government entrusted to a man whose word was
     truth, all might yet be re-established.So far from believing it
     impossible to make an arrangement with the Mahdi, I strongly
     suspect that he is a mere puppet, put forward by Elias, Zebehr's
     father-in-law, and the largest slave-owner in Obeid, and that he
     had assumed a religious title to give colour to his defence of
     the popular rights."There is one subject on which I cannot imagine any one can
     differ about.That is the impolicy of announcing our intention to
     evacuate Khartoum.Even if we were bound to do so we should have
     said nothing about it.The moment it is known that we have given
     up the game, every man will go over to the Mahdi.All men worship
     the rising sun.The difficulties of evacuation will be enormously
     increased, if, indeed, the withdrawal of our garrison is not
     rendered impossible."The late Khedive, who is one of the ablest and worst-used men in
     Europe, would not have made such a mistake, and under him the
     condition of Egypt proper was much better than it is to-day.Now,
     with regard to Egypt, the same principle should be observed that
     must be acted upon in the Soudan.Let your foundations be broad
     and firm, and based upon the contentment and welfare of the
     people.Hitherto, both in the Soudan and in Egypt, instead of
     constructing the social edifice like a pyramid, upon its base, we
     have been rearing an obelisk which a single push may overturn.Our safety in Egypt is to do something for the people.That is to
     say, you must reduce their rent, rescue them from the usurers,
     and retrench expenditure.Nine-tenths of the European _employes_
     might probably be weeded out with advantage.The remaining
     tenth--thoroughly efficient--should be retained; but, whatever
     you do, do not break up Sir Evelyn Wood's army, which is destined
     to do good work.Stiffen it as much as you please, but with
     Englishmen, not with Circassians.Circassians are as much
     foreigners in Egypt as Englishmen are, and certainly not more
     popular.John moved to the office.As for the European population, let them have charters
     for the formation of municipal councils, for raising volunteer
     corps, and for organising in their own defence.Anything more
     shameful than the flight from Egypt in 1882 I never read.Let
     them take an example from Shanghai, where the European settlement
     provides for its own defence and its own government.I should
     like to see a competent special Commissioner of the highest
     standing--such a man, for instance, as the Right Honourable W. E.
     Forster, who is free at once from traditions of the elders and of
     the Foreign Office and of the bondholders, sent out to put Nubar
     in the saddle, sift out unnecessary _employes_, and warn
     evil-doers in the highest places that they will not be allowed to
     play any tricks.If that were done, it would give confidence
     everywhere, and I see no reason why the last British soldier
     should not be withdrawn from Egypt in six months' time."A perusal of these passages will suffice to show the reader what
thoughts were uppermost in Gordon's mind at the very moment when he
was negotiating about his new task for the King of the Belgians on the
Congo, and those thoughts, inspired by the enthusiasm derived from his
noble spirit, and the perfect self-sacrifice with which he would have
thrown himself into what he conceived to be a good and necessary work,
made him the ready victim of a Government which absolutely did not
know what course to pursue, and which was delighted to find that the
very man, whom the public designated as the right man for the
situation, was ready--nay, eager--to take all the burden on his
shoulders whenever his own Government called on him to do so, and to
proceed straight to the scene of danger without so much as asking for
precise instructions, or insisting on guarantees for his own proper
treatment.There is no doubt that from his own individual point of
view, and as affecting any selfish or personal consideration he had at
heart, this mode of action was very unwise and reprehensible, and a
worldly censure would be the more severe on Gordon, because he acted
with his eyes open, and knew that the gravity of the trouble really
arose from the drifting policy and want of purpose of the very
Ministers for whom he was about to dare a danger that Gordon himself,
in a cooler moment, would very likely have deemed it unnecessary to
face.Into the motives that filled him with a belief that he might inspire a
Government, which had no policy, with one created by his own courage,
confidence, and success, it would be impossible to enter, but it can
be confidently asserted that, although they were drawn after him _sed
pede claudo_ to expend millions of treasure and thousands of lives,
they were never inspired by his exhortations and example to form a
definite policy as to the main point in the situation, viz., the
defence of the Egyptian possessions.In the flush of the moment,
carried along by an irresistible inclination to do the things which he
saw could be done, he overlooked all the other points of the case, and
especially that he was dealing with politicians tied by their party
principles, and thinking more of the passage through the House of some
domestic measure of fifth-rate importance than of the maintenance of
an Imperial interest and the arrest of an outbreak of Mahommedan
fanaticism which, if not checked, might call for a crusade.He never thought but that he was
dealing with other Englishmen equally mindful with himself of their
country's fame.If Gordon, long before he took up the task, had been engrossed in the
development of the Soudan difficulty and the Mahdi's power, those who
had studied the question and knew his special qualifications for the
task, had, at a very early stage of the trouble, called upon the
Government to avail themselves of his services, and there is no doubt
that if that advice had been promptly taken instead of slowly,
reluctantly, and only when matters were desperate, there is no doubt,
I repeat, remembering what he did later on, that Gordon would have
been able, without a single English regiment, to have strangled the
Mahdi's power in its infancy, and to have won back the Soudan for the
Khedive.But it may be said, where was it ever prominently suggested that
General Gordon should be despatched to the Soudan at a time before the
Mahdi had become supreme in that region, as he undoubtedly did by the
overthrow of Hicks and his force?I reply by the following quotations from prominent articles written by
myself in _The Times_ of January and February 1883.Until the capture
of El Obeid at that period the movement of the Mahdi was a local
affair of the importance of which no one, at a distance, could attempt
to judge, but that signal success made it the immediate concern of
those responsible in Egypt.On 9th January 1883, in an article in _The
Times_ on "The Soudan," occurs this passage:--

     "It is a misfortune, in the interests of Egypt, of civilisation,
     and of the mass of the Soudanese, that we cannot send General
     Gordon back to the region of the Upper Nile to complete there the
     good work he began eight years ago.With full powers, and with
     the assurance that the good fruits of his labours shall not be
     lost by the subsequent acts of corrupt Pashas, there need be
     little doubt of his attaining rapid success, while the memory of
     his achievements, when working for a half-hearted Government,
     and with incapable colleagues, yet lives in the hearts of the
     black people of the Soudan, and fills one of the most creditable
     pages in the history of recent administration of alien races by
     Englishmen."Again, on 17th February, in another article on the same subject:--

     "The authority of the Mahdi could scarcely be preserved save by
     constant activity and a policy of aggression, which would
     constitute a standing danger to the tranquillity of Lower Egypt.On the other hand, the preservation of the Khedive's sovereign
     rights through our instrumentality will carry with it the
     responsibility of providing the unhappy peoples of Darfour,
     Dongola, Kordofan, and the adjacent provinces with an equitable
     administration and immunity from heavy taxation.The obligation
     cannot be avoided under these, or perhaps under any
     circumstances, but the acceptance of it is not a matter to be
     entertained with an easy mind.The one thing that would reconcile
     us to the idea would be the assurance that General Gordon would
     be sent back with plenary powers to the old scene of his labours,
     and that he would accept the charge."As Gordon was not resorted to when the fall of El Obeid in the early
part of the year 1883 showed that the situation demanded some decisive
step, it is not surprising that he was left in inglorious inaction in
Palestine, while, as I and others knew well, his uppermost thought was
to be grappling with the Mahdi during the long lull of preparing
Hicks's expedition, and of its marching to its fate.The catastrophe
to that force on 4th November was known in London on 22nd November.I urged in every possible way the prompt employment of General Gordon,
who could have reached Egypt in a very short time from his place of
exile at Jaffa.But on this occasion I was snubbed, being told by one
of the ablest editors I have known, now dead, that "Gordon was
generally considered to be mad."However, at this moment the
Government seem to have come to the conclusion that General Gordon had
some qualifications to undertake the task in the Soudan, for at the
end of November 1883, Sir Charles Dilke, then a member of the Cabinet
as President of the Local Government Board, but whose special
knowledge and experience of foreign affairs often led to his assisting
Lord Granville at the Foreign Office, offered the Egyptian Government
Gordon's services.They were declined, and when, on 1st December 1883,
Lord Granville proposed the same measure in a more formal manner, and
asked in an interrogatory form whether General Charles Gordon would be
of any use, and if so in what capacity, Sir Evelyn Baring, now Lord
Cromer, threw cold water on the project, and stated on 2nd December
that "the Egyptian Government were very much averse to employing him."Subsequent events make it desirable to call special attention to the
fact that when, however tardily, the British Government did propose
the employment of General Gordon, the suggestion was rejected, not on
public grounds, but on private.Major Baring did not need to be
informed as to the work Gordon had done in the Soudan, and as to the
incomparable manner in which it had been performed.No one knew better
than he that, with the single exception of Sir Samuel Baker, who was
far too prudent to take up a thankless task, and to remove the
mountain of blunders others had committed, there was no man living who
had the smallest pretension to say that he could cope with the Soudan
difficulty, save Charles Gordon.Yet, when his name is suggested, he
treats the matter as one that cannot be entertained.There is not a
word as to the obvious propriety of suggesting Gordon's name, but the
objection of a puppet-prince like Tewfik is reported as fatal to the
course.Yet six weeks, with the mighty lever of an aroused public
opinion, sufficed to make him withdraw the opposition he advanced to
the appointment, not on public grounds, which was simply impossible,
but, I fear, from private feelings, for he had not forgotten the scene
in Cairo in 1878, when he attempted to control the action of Gordon on
the financial question.There would be no necessity to refer to this
matter, but for its consequences.Had Sir Evelyn Baring done his duty,
and given the only honest answer on 2nd December 1883, that if any one
man could save the situation, that man was Charles Gordon, Gordon
could have reached Khartoum early in January instead of late in
February, and that difference of six weeks might well have sufficed to
completely alter the course of subsequent events, and certainly to
save Gordon's life, seeing that, after all, the Nile Expedition was
only a few days too late.The delay was also attended with fatal
results to the civil population of Khartoum.Had Gordon reached there
early in January he could have saved them all, for as it was he sent
down 2600 refugees, i.e.merchants, old men, women, and children,
making all arrangements for their comfort in the very brief period of
open communication after his arrival, when the greater part of
February had been spent.The conviction that Gordon's appointment and departure were retarded
by personal _animus_ and an old difference is certainly strengthened
by all that follows.Sir Evelyn Baring and the Egyptian Government
would not have Charles Gordon, but they were quite content to entrust
the part of Saviour of the Soudan to Zebehr, the king of the
slave-hunters.On 13th December Lord Granville curtly informed our
representative at Cairo that the employment of Zebehr was inexpedient,
and Gordon in his own forcible way summed the matter up thus: "Zebehr
will manage to get taken prisoner, and will then head the revolt."But while Sir Evelyn Baring would not have Gordon and the British
Cabinet withheld its approval from Zebehr, it was felt that the
situation required that something should be done as soon as possible,
for the Mahdi was master of the Soudan, and at any moment tidings
might come of his advance on Khartoum, where there was only a small
and disheartened garrison, and a considerable defenceless population.The responsible Egyptian Ministers made several suggestions for
dealing with the situation, but they one and all deprecated ceding
territory to the Mahdi, as it would further alienate the tribes still
loyal or wavering and create graver trouble in the future.What they
chiefly contended for was the opening of the Berber-Souakim route with
10,000 troops, who should be Turks, as English troops were not
available.It is important to note that this suggestion did not shock
the Liberal Government, and on 13th December 1883 Lord Granville
replied that the Government had no objection to offer to the
employment of Turkish troops at Souakim for service in the Soudan.In
the following month the Foreign Secretary went one step further, and
"concurred in the surrender of the Soudan to the Sultan."In fact the
British Government were only anxious about one thing, and that was to
get rid of the Soudan, and to be saved any further worry in the
matter.No doubt, if the Sultan had had the money to pay for the
despatch of the expedition, this last suggestion would have been
adopted, but as he had not, the only way to get rid of the
responsibility was to thrust it on Gordon, who was soon discovered to
be ready to accept it without delay or conditions.On 22nd December 1883 Sir Evelyn Baring wrote: "It would be necessary
to send an English officer of high authority to Khartoum with full
powers to withdraw the garrisons, and to make the best arrangements
possible for the future government of the country."News from Khartoum
showed that everything there was in a state verging on panic, that the
people thought they were abandoned by the Government, and that the
enemy had only to advance for the place to fall without a blow.Lastly
Colonel de Coetlogon, the governor after Hicks's death, recommended on
9th January the immediate withdrawal of the garrison from Khartoum,
which he thought could be accomplished if carried out with the
greatest promptitude, but which involved the desertion of the other
garrisons.Abd-el-Kader, ex-Governor-General of the Soudan and
Minister of War, offered to proceed to Khartoum, but when he
discovered that the abandonment of the Soudan was to be proclaimed, he
absolutely refused on any consideration to carry out what he termed a
hopeless errand.All these circumstances gave special point to Sir Evelyn Baring's
recommendation on 22nd December that "an English officer of high
authority should be sent to Khartoum," and the urgency of a decision
was again impressed on the Government in his telegram of 1st January,
because Egypt is on the point of losing the Soudan, and moreover
possesses no force with which to defend the valley of the Nile
downwards.But in the many messages that were sent on this subject
during the last fortnight of the year 1883, the name of the one
"English officer of high authority" specially suited for the task
finds no mention.As this omission cannot be attributed to ignorance,
some different motive must be discovered.At last, on 10th January,
Lord Granville renews his suggestion to send General Gordon, and asks
whether he would not be of some assistance under the altered
circumstances.The "altered circumstances" must have been inserted for
the purpose of letting down Sir Evelyn Baring as lightly as possible,
for the only alteration in the circumstances was that six weeks had
been wasted in coming to any decision at all.On 11th January Sir
Evelyn Baring replied that he and Nubar Pasha did not think Gordon's
services could be utilised, and yet three weeks before he had
recommended that "an English officer of high authority" should be
sent, and he had even complained because prompter measures were not
taken to give effect to his recommendation.The only possible
conclusion is that, in Sir Evelyn Baring's opinion, General Gordon was
not "an English officer of high authority."As if to make his views
more emphatic, Sir Evelyn Baring on 15th January again telegraphed for
an English officer with the intentional and conspicuous omission of
Gordon's name, which had been three times urged upon him by his own
Government.But determined as Sir Evelyn Baring was that by no act or
word of his should General Gordon be appointed to the Soudan, there
were more powerful influences at work than even his strong will.The publication of General Gordon's views in the _Pall Mall Gazette_
of 9th January 1884 had roused public opinion to the importance and
urgency of the matter.It had also revealed that there was at least
one man who was not in terror of the Mahdi's power, and who thought
that the situation might still be saved.There is no doubt that that
publication was the direct and immediate cause of Lord Granville's
telegram of 10th January; but Sir Evelyn Baring, unmoved by what
people thought or said at home, coldly replied on 11th January that
Gordon is not the man he wants.If there had been no other
considerations in the matter, I have no doubt that Sir Evelyn Baring
would have beaten public opinion, and carried matters in the high,
dictatorial spirit he had shown since the first mention of Gordon's
name.But he had not made allowance for an embarrassed and purposeless
Government, asking only to be relieved of the whole trouble, and
willing to adopt any suggestion--even to resign its place to "the
unspeakable Turk"--so long as it was no longer worried in the matter.At that moment Gordon appears on the scene, ready and anxious to
undertake single-handed a task for which others prescribe armies and
millions of money.Public opinion greets him as the man for the
occasion, and certainly he is the man to suit "that" Government.The
only obstruction is Sir Evelyn Baring.Against any other array of
forces his views would have prevailed, but even for him these are too
strong.On 15th January Gordon saw Lord Wolseley, as described in the last
chapter, and then and there it is discovered and arranged that he will
go to the Soudan, but only at the Government's request, provided the
King of the Belgians will consent to his postponing the fulfilment of
his promise, as Gordon knows he cannot help but do, for it was given
on the express stipulation that the claim of his own country should
always come first.King Leopold, who has behaved throughout with
generosity, and the most kind consideration towards Gordon, is
naturally displeased and upset, but he feels that he cannot restrain
Gordon or insist on the letter of his bond.The Congo Mission is
therefore broken off or suspended, as described in the last chapter.In the evening of the 15th Lord Granville despatched a telegram to Sir
Evelyn Baring, no longer asking his opinion or advice, but stating
that the Government have determined to send General Gordon to the
Soudan, and that he will start without delay.To that telegram the
British representative could make no demur short of resigning his
post, but at last the grudging admission was wrung from him that
"Gordon would be the best man."This conclusion, to which anyone
conversant with the facts, as Sir Evelyn Baring was, would have come
at once, was therefore only arrived at seven weeks after Sir Charles
Dilke first brought forward Gordon's name as the right person to deal
with the Soudan difficulty.That loss of time was irreparable, and in
the end proved fatal to Gordon himself.In describing the last mission, betrayal, and death of Gordon, the
heavy responsibility of assigning the just blame to those individuals
who were in a special degree the cause of that hero's fate cannot be
shirked by any writer pretending to record history.Lord Cromer has
filled a difficult post in Egypt for many years with advantage to his
country, but in the matter of General Gordon's last Nile mission he
allowed his personal feelings to obscure his judgment.He knew that
Gordon was a difficult, let it be granted an impossible, colleague;
that he would do things in his own way in defiance of diplomatic
timidity and official rigidity; and that, instead of there being in
the Egyptian firmament the one planet Baring, there would be only the
single sun of Gordon.All these considerations were human, but they
none the less show that he allowed his private feelings, his
resentment at Gordon's treatment of him in 1878, to bias his judgment
in a matter of public moment.It was his opposition alone that
retarded Gordon's departure by seven weeks, and indeed the delay was
longer, as Gordon was then at Jaffa, and that delay, I repeat it
solemnly, cost Gordon his life.Whoever else was to blame afterwards,
the first against whom a verdict of Guilty must be entered, without
any hope of reprieve at the bar of history, was Sir Evelyn Baring, now
Lord Cromer.Mr Gladstone and his Government are certainly clear of any reflection
in this stage of the matter.They did their best to put forward
General Gordon immediately on the news coming of the Hicks disaster,
and although they might have shown greater determination in compelling
the adoption of their plan, which they were eventually obliged to do,
this was a very venial fault, and not in any serious way blameworthy.Nor did they ever seek to repudiate their responsibility for sending
Gordon to the Soudan, although a somewhat craven statement by Lord
Granville, in a speech at Shrewsbury in September 1885, to the effect
that "Gordon went to Khartoum at his own request," might seem to infer
that they did.This remark may have been a slip, or an incorrect mode
of saying that Gordon willingly accepted the task given him by the
Government, but Mr Gladstone placed the matter in its true light when
he wrote that "General Gordon went to the Soudan at the request of
H.M.Gordon, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Donald Stewart, an officer
who had visited the Soudan in 1883, and written an able report on it,
left London by the Indian mail of 18th January 1884.The decision to
send Colonel Stewart with him was arrived at only at the very last
moment, and on the platform at Charing Cross Station the acquaintance
of the two men bound together in such a desperate partnership
practically began.It is worth recalling that in that hurried and
stirring scene, when the War Office, with the Duke of Cambridge, had
assembled to see him off, Gordon found time to say to one of Stewart's
nearest relations, "Be sure that he will not go into any danger which
I do not share, and I am sure that when I am in danger he will not be
far behind."Gordon's journey to Egypt was uneventful, but after the exciting
events that preceded his departure he found the leisure of his
sea-trip from Brindisi beneficial and advantageous, for the purpose of
considering his position and taking stock of the situation he had to
face.By habit and temperament Gordon was a bad emissary to carry out
cut-and-dried instructions, more especially when they related to a
subject upon which he felt very strongly and held pronounced views.The instructions which the Government gave him were as follows, and I
quote the full text.They were probably not drawn up and in Gordon's
hands more than two hours before he left Charing Cross, and personally
I do not suppose that he had looked through them, much less studied
them.He went to the Soudan to
rescue the garrisons, and to carry out the evacuation of the province
after providing for its administration.The letter given in the
previous chapter shows how vague and incomplete was the agreement
between himself and Ministers.It was nothing more than the expression
of an idea that the Soudan should be evacuated, but how and under what
conditions was left altogether to the chapter of accidents.At the
start the Government's view of the matter and his presented no glaring
difference.They sent General Gordon to rescue and withdraw the
garrisons if he could do so, and they were also not averse to his
establishing any administration that he chose.But the main point on
which they laid stress was that they were to be no longer troubled in
the affair.Gordon's marvellous qualities were to extricate them from
the difficult position in which the shortcomings of the Egyptian
Government had placed them, and beyond that they had no definite
thought or care as to how the remedy was to be discovered and applied.The following instructions should be read by the light of these
reflections, which show that, while they nominally started from the
same point, Gordon and the Government were never really in touch, and
had widely different goals in view:--

                              "FOREIGN OFFICE, _January 18th, 1884_."Her Majesty's Government are desirous that you should proceed at
     once to Egypt, to report to them on the military situation in the
     Soudan, and on the measures which it may be advisable to take for
     the security of the Egyptian garrisons still holding positions in
     that country, and for the safety of the European population in
     Khartoum."You are also desired to consider and report upon the best mode
     of effecting the evacuation of the interior of the Soudan, and
     upon the manner in which the safety and the good administration
     by the Egyptian Government of the ports on the sea-coast can best
     be secured."In connection with this subject, you should pay especial
     consideration to the question of the steps that may usefully be
     taken to counteract the stimulus which it is feared may possibly
     be given to the Slave Trade by the present insurrectionary
     movement and by the withdrawal of the Egyptian authority from the
     interior."You will be under the instructions of Her Majesty's Agent and
     Consul-General at Cairo, through whom your Reports to Her
     Majesty's Government should be sent, under flying seal."You will consider yourself authorized and instructed to perform
     such other duties as the Egyptian Government may desire to
     entrust to you, and as may be communicated to you by Sir E.
     Baring.You will be accompanied by Colonel Stewart, who will
     assist you in the duties thus confided to you."On your arrival in Egypt you will at once communicate with Sir
     E. Baring, who will arrange to meet you, and will settle with you
     whether you should proceed direct to Suakin, or should go
     yourself or despatch Colonel Stewart to Khartoum _via_ the Nile."General Gordon had not got very far on his journey before he began to
see that there were points on which it would be better for him to know
the Government's mind and to state his own.Neither at this time nor
throughout the whole term of his stay at Khartoum did Gordon attempt
to override the main decision of the Government policy, viz.to
evacuate the Soudan, although he left plenty of documentary evidence
to show that this was not his policy or opinion.Moreover, his own
policy had been well set forth in the _Pall Mall Gazette_, and might
be summed up in the necessity to keep the Eastern Soudan, and the
impossibility of fortifying Lower Egypt against the advance of the
Mahdi.But he had none the less consented to give his services to a
Government which had decided on evacuation, and he remained loyal to
that purpose, although in a little time it was made clear that there
was a wide and impassable gulf between the views of the British
Government and its too brilliant agent.The first doubt that flashed through his mind, strangely enough, was
about Zebehr.He knew, of course, that it had been proposed to employ
him, and that Mr Gladstone had not altogether unnaturally decided
against it.But Gordon knew the man's ability, his influence, and the
close connection he still maintained with the Soudan, where his
father-in-law Elias was the Mahdi's chief supporter, and the paymaster
of his forces.I believe that Gordon was in his heart of the opinion
that the Mahdi was only a lay figure, and that the real author of the
whole movement in the Soudan was Zebehr, but that the Mahdi, carried
away by his exceptional success, had somewhat altered the scope of the
project, and given it an exclusively religious or fanatical character.It is somewhat difficult to follow all the workings of Gordon's mind
on this point, nor is it necessary to do so, but the fact that should
not be overlooked is Gordon's conviction in the great power for good
or evil of Zebehr.Thinking this matter over in the train, he
telegraphed from Brindisi to Lord Granville on 30th January, begging
that Zebehr might be removed from Cairo to Cyprus.There is no doubt
as to the wisdom of this suggestion, and had it been adopted the lives
of Colonel Stewart and his companions would probably have been spared,
for, as will be seen, there is good ground to think that they were
murdered by men of his tribe.In Cyprus Zebehr would have been
incapable of mischief, but no regard was paid to Gordon's wish, and
thus commenced what proved to be a long course of indifference.During the voyage from Brindisi to Port-Said Gordon drew up a
memorandum on his instructions, correcting some of the errors that had
crept into them, and explaining what, more or less, would be the best
course to follow.One part of his instructions had to go by the
board--that enjoining him to restore to the ancient families of the
Soudan their long-lost possessions, for there were no such families in
existence.One paragraph in that memorandum was almost pathetic, when
he begged the Government to take the most favourable view of his
shortcomings if he found himself compelled by necessity to deviate
from his instructions.Colonel Stewart supported that view in a very
sensible letter, when he advised the Government, "as the wisest
course, to rely on the discretion of General Gordon and his knowledge
of the country."General Gordon's original plan was to proceed straight to Souakim, and
to travel thence by Berber to Khartoum, leaving the Foreign Office to
arrange at Cairo what his status should be, but this mode of
proceeding would have been both irregular and inconvenient, and it was
rightly felt that he ought to hold some definite position assigned by
the Khedive, as the ruler of Egypt.On arriving at Port-Said he was
met by Sir Evelyn Wood, who was the bearer of a private letter from
his old Academy and Crimean chum, Sir Gerald Graham, begging him to
"throw over all personal feelings" and come to Cairo.The appeal could
not have come from a quarter that would carry more weight with Gordon,
who had a feeling of affection as well as respect for General Graham;
and, moreover, the course suggested was so unmistakably the right one,
that he could not, and did not, feel any hesitation in taking it,
although he was well aware of Sir Evelyn Baring's opposition, which
showed that the sore of six years before still rankled.Gordon
accordingly accompanied Sir Evelyn Wood to Cairo, where he arrived on
the evening of 24th January.On the following day he was received by
Tewfik, who conferred on him for the second time the high office of
Governor-General of the Soudan.It is unnecessary to lay stress on any
minor point in the recital of the human drama which began with the
interview with Lord Wolseley on 15th January, and thence went on
without a pause to the tragedy of 26th January in the following year;
but it does seem strange, if the British Government were resolved to
stand firm to its evacuation policy, that it should have allowed its
emissary to accept the title of Governor-General of a province which
it had decided should cease to exist.This was not the only nor even the most important consequence of his
turning aside to go to Cairo.When there, those who were interested
for various reasons in the proposal to send Zebehr to the Soudan, made
a last effort to carry their project by arranging an interview between
that person and Gordon, in the hope that all matters in dispute
between them might be discussed, and, if possible, settled.Gordon,
whose enmity to his worst foe was never deep, and whose temperament
would have made him delight in a discussion with the arch-fiend, said
at once that he had no objection to meeting Zebehr, and would discuss
any matter with him or any one else.The penalty of this magnanimity
was that he was led to depart from the uncompromising but safe
attitude of opposition and hostility he had up to this observed
towards Zebehr, and to record opinions that were inconsistent with
those he had expressed on the same subject only a few weeks and even
days before.But even in what follows I believe it is safe to discern
his extraordinary perspicuity; for when he saw that the Government
would not send Zebehr to Cyprus, he promptly concluded that it would
be far safer to take or have him with him in the Soudan, where he
could personally watch and control his movements, than to allow him to
remain at Cairo, guiding hostile plots with his money and influence in
the very region whither Gordon was proceeding.This view is supported by the following Memorandum, drawn up by
General Gordon on 25th January 1884, the day before the interview, and
entitled by him "Zebehr Pasha _v._ General Gordon":--

     "Zebehr Pasha's first connection with me began in 1877, when I
     was named Governor-General of Soudan.Zebehr was then at Cairo,
     being in litigation with Ismail Pasha Eyoub, my predecessor in
     Soudan.Zebehr had left his son Suleiman in charge of his forces
     in the Bahr Gazelle.Darfour was in complete rebellion, and I
     called on Suleiman to aid the Egyptian army in May 1877.In June 1877 I went to Darfour, and was engaged with the
     rebels when Suleiman moved up his men, some 6000, to Dara.It was
     in August 1877.He and his men assumed an hostile attitude to the
     Government of Dara.I came down to Dara and went out to
     Suleiman's camp, and asked them to come and see me at Dara.Suleiman and his chiefs did so, and I told them I felt sure that
     they meditated rebellion, but if they rebelled they would perish.I offered them certain conditions, appointing certain chiefs to
     be governors of certain districts, but refusing to let Suleiman
     be Governor of Bahr Gazelle.After some days' parleying, some of
     Suleiman's chiefs came over to my side, and these chiefs warned
     me that, if I did not take care, Suleiman would attack me.I
     therefore ordered Suleiman to go to Shaka, and ordered those
     chiefs who were inclined to accept my terms in another
     direction, so as to separate them.On this Suleiman accepted my
     terms, and he and others were made Beys.He left for Shaka with
     some 4000 men.He looted the country from Dara to Shaka, and did
     not show any respect to my orders.The rebellion in Darfour being
     settled, I went down to Shaka with 200 men.Suleiman was there
     with 4000.Then he came to me and begged me to let him have the
     sole command in Bahr Gazelle.I refused, and I put him, Suleiman,
     under another chief, and sent up to Bahr Gazelle 200 regular
     troops.Things remained quiet in Bahr Gazelle till I was ordered
     to Cairo in April 1878, about the finances.I then saw Zebehr
     Pasha, who wished to go up to Soudan, and I refused.I left for
     Aden in May, and in June 1878 Suleiman broke out in revolt, and
     killed the 200 regular troops at Bahr Gazelle.I sent Gessi
     against him in August 1878, and Gessi crushed him in the course
     of 1879.Gessi captured a lot of letters in the divan of
     Suleiman, one of which was from Zebehr Pasha inciting him to
     revolt.The original of this letter was given by me to H.H.the
     Khedive, and I also had printed a brochure containing it and a
     sort of _expose_ to the people of Soudan why the revolt had been
     put down--viz.that it was not a question of slave-hunting, but
     one of revolt against the Khedive's authority.Copies of this
     must exist.On the production of this letter of Zebehr to
     Suleiman, I ordered the confiscation of Zebehr's property in
     Soudan, and a court martial to sit on Zebehr's case.This court
     martial was held under Hassan Pasha Halmi; the court condemned
     Zebehr to death; its proceedings were printed in the brochure I
     alluded to.Gessi afterwards caught Suleiman and shot him.With
     details of that event I am not acquainted, and I never saw the
     papers, for I went to Abyssinia.Gessi's orders were to try him,
     and if guilty to shoot him.This is all I have to say about
     Zebehr and myself."Zebehr, without doubt, was the greatest slave-hunter who ever
     existed.Zebehr is the most able man in the Soudan; he is a
     capital general, and has been wounded several times.Zebehr has a
     capacity of government far beyond any statesman in the Soudan.All the followers of the Mahdi would, I believe, leave the Mahdi
     on Zebehr's approach, for they are ex-chiefs of Zebehr.Personally, I have a great admiration for Zebehr, for he is a
     man, and is infinitely superior to those poor fellows who have
     been governors of Soudan; but I question in my mind, 'Will Zebehr
     ever forgive me the death of his son?'and that question has
     regulated my action respecting him, for I have been told he bears
     me the greatest malice, and one cannot wonder at it if one is a
     father."I would even now risk taking Zebehr, and would willingly bear
     the responsibility of doing so, convinced, as I am, that Zebehr's
     approach ends the Mahdi, which is a question which has its pulse
     in Syria, the Hedjaz, and Palestine."It cannot be the wish of H.M.'s Government, or of the Egyptian
     Government, to have an intestine war in the Soudan on its
     evacuation, yet such is sure to ensue, and the only way which
     could prevent it is the restoration of Zebehr, who would be
     accepted on all sides, and who would end the Mahdi in a couple of
     months.My duty is to obey orders of H.M.'s Government, _i.e._ to
     evacuate the Soudan as quickly as possible, _vis-a-vis_ the
     safety of the Egyptian employes."To do this I count on Zebehr; but if the addenda is made that I
     leave a satisfactory settlement of affairs, then Zebehr becomes a
     _sine qua non_.'s
     Government or Egyptian Government desire a settled state of
     affairs in Soudan after the evacuation?Do these Governments want
     to be free of this religious fanatic?If they do, then Zebehr
     should be sent; and if the two Governments are indifferent, then
     do not send him, and I have confidence one will (_D.V._) get out
     the Egyptian employes in three or four months, and will leave a
     cockpit behind us.It is not my duty to dictate what should be
     done.I will only say, first, I was justified in my action
     against Zebehr; second, that if Zebehr has no malice personally
     against me, I should take him at once as a humanly certain
     settler of the Mahdi and of those in revolt.I have written this
     Minute, and Zebehr's story may be heard.I only wish that after
     he has been interrogated, I may be questioned on such subjects as
     his statements are at variance with mine.I would wish this
     inquiry to be official, and in such a way that, whatever may be
     the decision come to, it may be come to in my absence."With respect to the slave-trade, I think nothing of it, for
     there will always be slave-trade as long as Turkey and Egypt buy
     the slaves, and it may be Zebehr will or might in his interest
     stop it in some manner.I will therefore sum up my opinion, viz.that I would willingly take the responsibility of taking Zebehr
     up with me if, after an interview with Sir E. Baring and Nubar
     Pasha, they tell 'the mystic feeling' I could trust him, and
     which'mystic feeling' I felt I had for him to-night when I met
     him at Cherif Pasha's house.Zebehr would have nothing to gain in
     hunting me, and I would have no fear.In this affair my desire, I
     own, would be to take Zebehr.I cannot exactly say why I feel
     towards him thus, and I feel sure that his going would settle the
     Soudan affair to the benefit of H.M.'s Government, and I would
     bear the responsibility of recommending it."C. G. GORDON, Major-General."An interview between Gordon and Zebehr was therefore arranged for 26th
January, the day after this memorandum was written.On 25th it should
also be remembered that the Khedive had again made Gordon
Governor-General of the Soudan.Besides the two principals, there were
present at this interview Sir Evelyn Baring, Sir Gerald Graham,
Colonel Watson, and Nubar Pasha.Zebehr protested his innocence of the
charges made against him; and when Gordon reminded him of his letter,
signed with his hand and bearing his seal, found in the divan of his
son Suleiman, he called upon Gordon to produce this letter, which, of
course, he could not do, because it was sent with the other
incriminating documents to the Khedive in 1879.The passage in that
letter establishing the guilt of Zebehr may, however, be cited, it
being first explained that Idris Ebter was Gordon's governor of the
Bahr Gazelle province, and that Suleiman did carry out his father's
instructions to attack him."Now since this same Idris Ebter has not appreciated our kindness
     towards him, nor shown regard for his duty towards God, therefore
     do you accomplish his ejection by compulsory force, threats, and
     menaces, without personal hurt, but with absolute expulsion and
     deprivation from the Bahr-el-Gazelle, leaving no remnant of him
     in that region, no son, and no relation.For he is a
     mischief-maker, and God loveth not them who make mischief."It is highly probable, from the air of confidence with which Zebehr
called for the production of the letter, that, either during the Arabi
rising or in some other way, he had recovered possession of the
original; but Gordon had had all the documents copied in 1879, and
bound in the little volume mentioned in the preceding Memorandum, as
well as in several of his letters, and the evidence as to Zebehr's
complicity and guilt seems quite conclusive.In his Memorandum Gordon makes two conditions: first, "if Zebehr bears
no malice personally against me, I will take him to the Soudan at
once," and this condition is given further force later on in reference
to "the mystic feeling."The second condition was that Zebehr was only
to be sent if the Government desired a settled state of affairs after
the evacuation.From the beginning of the interview it was clear to
those present that no good would come of it, as Zebehr could scarcely
control his feelings, and showed what they deemed a personal
resentment towards Gordon that at any moment might have found
expression in acts.After a brief discussion it was decided to adjourn
the meeting, on the pretence of having search made for the
incriminating document, but really to avert a worse scene.General
Graham, in the after-discussion on Gordon's renewed desire to take
Zebehr with him, declared that it would be dangerous to acquiesce; and
Colonel Watson plainly stated that it would mean the death of one or
both of them.Gordon, indifferent to all considerations of personal
danger, did not take the same view of Zebehr's attitude towards him
personally, and would still have taken him with him, if only on the
ground that he would be less dangerous in the Soudan than at Cairo;
but the authorities would not acquiesce in a proposition that they
considered would inevitably entail the murder of Gordon at an early
stage of the journey.They cannot, from any point of view, be greatly
blamed in this matter; and when Gordon complains later on, as he
frequently did complain, about the matter, the decision must be with
his friends at Cairo, for they strictly conformed with the first
condition specified in his own Memorandum.At the same time, he was
perfectly correct in his views as to Zebehr's power and capacity for
mischief, and it was certainly very unfortunate and wrong that his
earlier suggestion of removing him to Cyprus or some other place of
safety was not adopted.The following new correspondence will at least suggest a doubt whether
Gordon was not more correct in his view of Zebehr's attitude towards
himself than his friends.What they deemed strong resentment and a
bitter personal feeling towards Gordon on the part of Zebehr, he
considered merely the passing excitement from discussing a matter of
great moment and interest.He would still have taken Zebehr with him,
and for many weeks after his arrival at Khartoum he expected that, in
reply to his frequently reiterated messages, "Send me Zebehr," the
ex-Dictator of the Soudan would be sent up from Cairo.In one of the
last letters to his sister, dated Khartoum, 5th March 1884, he wrote:
"I hope _much_ from Zebehr's coming up, for he is so well known to all
up here."Some time after communications were broken off with Khartoum, Miss
Gordon wrote to Zebehr, begging him to use his influence with the
Mahdi to get letters for his family to and from General Gordon.To
that Zebehr replied as follows:--

     "TO HER EXCELLENCY MISS GORDON,--I am very grateful to you for
     having had the honour of receiving your letter of the 13th, and
     am very sorry to say that I am not able to write to the Mahdi,
     because he is new, and has appeared lately in the Soudan.I do
     not know him.He is not of my tribe nor of my relations, nor of
     the tribes with which I was on friendly terms; and for these
     reasons I do not see the way in which I could carry out your
     wish.I am ready to serve you in all that is possible all my life
     through, but please accept my excuse in this matter.ZEBEHR RAHAMAH, Pasha."CAIRO, _22nd January 1885_."Some time after the fall of Khartoum, Miss Gordon made a further
communication to Zebehr, but, owing to his having been exiled to
Gibraltar, it was not until October 1887 that she received the
following reply, which is certainly curious; and I believe that this
letter and personal conversations with Zebehr induced one of the
officers present at the interview on 26th January 1884 to change his
original opinion, and to conclude that it would have been safe for
General Gordon to have taken Zebehr with him:--

                              "CAIRO [_received by Miss Gordon
                                  about 12th October 1887_]."HONOURABLE LADY,--I most respectfully beg to acknowledge the
     receipt of your letter, enclosed to that addressed to me by His
     Excellency Watson Pasha."This letter has caused me a great satisfaction, as it speaks of
     the friendly relations that existed between me and the late
     Gordon Pasha, your brother, whom you have replaced in my heart,
     and this has been ascertained to me by your inquiring about me
     and your congratulating me for my return to Cairo" [that is,
     after his banishment to Gibraltar]."I consider that your poor brother is still alive in you, and for
     the whole run of my life I put myself at your disposal, and beg
     that you will count upon me as a true and faithful friend to you."You will also kindly pay my respects to the whole family of
     Gordon Pasha, and may you not deprive me of your good news at any
     time."My children and all my family join themselves to me, and pay you
     their best respects."Further, I beg to inform you that the messenger who had been
     previously sent through me, carrying Government correspondence to
     your brother, Gordon Pasha, has reached him, and remitted the
     letter he had in his own hands, and without the interference of
     any other person.The details of his history are mentioned in the
     enclosed report, which I hope you will kindly read.--Believe me,
     honourable Lady, to remain yours most faithfully,

                                             ZEBEHR RAHAMAH.""When I came to Cairo and resided in it as I was before, I kept
     myself aside of all political questions connected with the Soudan
     or others, according to the orders given me by the Government to
     that effect.But as a great rumour was spread over by the high
     Government officials who arrived from the Soudan, and were with
     H.E.General Gordon Pasha at Khartoum before and after it fell,
     that all my properties in that country had been looted, and my
     relations ill-treated, I have been bound, by a hearty feeling of
     compassion, to ask the above said officials what they knew about
     it, and whether the messenger sent by me with the despatches
     addressed by the Government to General Gordon Pasha had reached
     Khartoum and remitted what he had."These officials informed me verbally that on the 25th Ramadan
     1301 (March 1884), at the time they were sitting at Khartoum with
     General Gordon, my messenger, named Fadhalla Kabileblos, arrived
     there, and remitted to the General in his proper hands, and
     without the interference of anyone, all the despatches he had on
     him.After that the General expressed his greatest content for
     the receipt of the correspondence, and immediately gave orders to
     the artillery to fire twenty-five guns, in sign of rejoicing, and
     in order to show to the enemy his satisfaction for the news of
     the arrival of British troops.General Gordon then treated my
     messenger cordially, and requested the Government to pay him a
     sum of L500 on his return to Cairo, as a gratuity for all the
     dangers he had run in accomplishing his faithful mission.Besides
     that, the General gave him, when he embarked with Colonel
     Stewart, L13 to meet his expenses on the journey.A few days
     after the arrival of my messenger at Khartoum, H.E.General
     Gordon thought it proper to appoint Colonel Stewart for coming to
     Cairo on board a man-of-war with a secret mission, and several
     letters, written by the General in English and Arabic, were put
     in two envelopes, one addressed to the British and the other to
     the Egyptian Government, and were handed over to my messenger,
     with the order to return to Cairo with Colonel Stewart on board a
     special steamer."But when Khartoum fell, and the rebels got into it, making all
     the inhabitants prisoners, the Government officials above
     referred to were informed that my messenger had been arrested,
     and all the correspondence that he had on him, addressed by
     General Gordon to the Government, was seized; for when the
     steamer on board of which they were arrived at Abou Kamar she
     went on rocks, and having been broken, the rebels made a massacre
     of all those who were on board; and as, on seeing the letters
     carried by my messenger, they found amongst them a private letter
     addressed to me by H.E.Gordon Pasha, expressing his thanks for
     my faithfulness to him, the rebels declared me an infidel, and
     decided to seize all my goods and properties, comprising them in
     their _Beit-el-Mal_ (that is, Treasury) as it happened in fact."Moreover, the members of my family who were in the Soudan were
     treated most despotically, and their existence was rendered most
     difficult."Such a state of things being incompatible with the suspicion
     thrown upon me as regards my faithfulness to the Government, I
     have requested the high Government officials referred to above to
     give me an official certificate to that effect, which they all
     gave; and the enclosed copies will make known to those who take
     the trouble to read them that I have been honest and faithful in
     all what has been entrusted to me.This is the summary of the
     information I have obtained from persons I have reason to
     believe."Some further evidence of Zebehr's feelings is given in the following
letter from him to Sir Henry Gordon, dated in October 1884:--

     "Your favour of 3rd September has been duly received, for which I
     thank you.I herewith enclose my photograph, and hope that you
     will kindly send me yours."The letter that you wished me to send H.E.General Gordon was
     sent on the 18th August last, registered.I hope that you will
     excuse me in delaying to reply, for when your letter arrived I
     was absent, and when I returned I was very sorry that they had
     not forwarded the letter to me; otherwise I should have replied
     at once."I had closed this letter with the photograph when I received
     fresh news, to the effect that the messengers we sent to H.E.I therefore kept back the
     letter and photograph till they arrived, and I should see what
     tidings they brought.... You have told me that Lord Northbrook
     knows what has passed between us.I endeavoured and devised to
     see His Excellency, but I did not succeed, as he was very busy.I
     presented a petition to him that he should help to recover the
     property of which I was robbed unjustly, and which H.E.your
     brother ordered to be restored, and at the same time to right me
     for the oppression I had suffered.I have had no answer up to
     this present moment.Gordon Pasha will return in safety, accept my
     best regards, dear Sir, and present my compliments to your
     sister.1884._"

To sum up on this important matter.There never was any doubt that the
authorities in the Delta took on themselves a grave responsibility
when they remained deaf to all Gordon's requests for the co-operation
of Zebehr.They would justify themselves by saying that they had a
tender regard for Gordon's own safety.At least this was the only
point on which they showed it, and they would not like to be deprived
of the small credit attached to it; but the evidence I have now
adduced renders even this plea of doubtful force.As to the value of
Zebehr's co-operation, if Gordon could have obtained it there cannot
be two opinions.Gordon did not exaggerate in the least degree when he
said that on the approach of Zebehr the star of the Mahdi would at
once begin to wane, or, in other words, that he looked to Zebehr's
ability and influence as the sure way to make his own mission a
success.On the very night of his interview with Zebehr, and within forty-eight
hours of his arrival in Cairo, General Gordon and his English
companion, with four Egyptian officers, left by train for Assiout, _en
route_ to Khartoum.Before entering on the events of this crowning passage in the career
of this hero, I think the reader might well consider on its threshold
the exact nature of the adventure undertaken by Gordon as if it were a
sort of everyday experience and duty.At the commencement of the year
1884 the military triumph of the Mahdi was as complete as it could be
throughout the Soudan.Khartoum was still held by a force of between
4000 and 6000 men.Although not known, all the other garrisons in the
Nile Valley, except Kassala and Sennaar, both near the Abyssinian
frontier, had capitulated, and the force at Khartoum would certainly
have offered no resistance if the Mahdi had advanced immediately after
the defeat of Hicks.Even if he had reached Khartoum before the
arrival of Gordon, it is scarcely doubtful that the place would have
fallen without fighting.Colonel de Coetlogon was in command, but the
troops had no faith in him, and he had no confidence in them.That
officer, on 9th January, "telegraphed to the Khedive, strongly urging
an immediate withdrawal from Khartoum.He said that one-third of the
garrison are unreliable, and that even if it were twice as strong as
it is, it would not hold Khartoum against the whole country."In
several subsequent telegrams Colonel de Coetlogon importuned the Cairo
authorities to send him authority to leave with the garrison, and on
the very day that the Government finally decided to despatch Gordon he
telegraphed that there was only just enough time left to escape to
Berber.While the commandant held and expressed these views, it is not
surprising that the garrison and inhabitants were disheartened and
decidedly unfit to make any resolute opposition to a confident and
daring foe.There is excellent independent testimony as to the state
of public feeling in the town.Mr Frank Power had been residing in Khartoum as correspondent of _The
Times_ from August 1883, and in December, after the Hicks catastrophe,
he was appointed Acting British Consul.In a letter written on 12th
January he said: "They have done nothing for us yet from Cairo.They
are leaving it all to fate, and the rebels around us are growing
stronger!"Such was the general situation at Khartoum when General
Gordon was ordered, almost single-handed, to save it; and not merely
to rescue its garrison, pronounced by its commander to be partly
unreliable and wholly inadequate, but other garrisons scattered
throughout the regions held by the Mahdi and his victorious legions.A
courageous man could not have been charged with cowardice if he had
shrunk back from such a forlorn hope, and declined to take on his
shoulders the responsibility that properly devolved on the commander
on the spot.A prudent man would at least have insisted that his
instructions should be clear, and that the part his Government and
country were to play was to be as strictly defined and as obligatory
on them as his own.But while Gordon's courage was of such a quality
that I believe no calculation of odds or difficulties ever entered
into his view, his prudence never possessed the requisite amount of
suspicion to make him provide against the contingencies of absolute
betrayal by those who sent him, or of that change in party convenience
and tactics which induced those who first thought his mission most
advantageous as solving a difficulty, or at least putting off a
trouble, to veer round to the conclusion that his remaining at
Khartoum, his honourable but rigid resolve not to return without the
people he went to save, was a distinct breach of contract, and a
serious offence.The state of feeling at Khartoum was one verging on panic.The richest
townsmen had removed their property and families to Berber.Colonel de
Coetlogon had the river boats with steam up ready to commence the
evacuation, and while everyone thought that the place was doomed, the
telegraph instrument was eagerly watched for the signal to begin the
flight.The tension could not have lasted much longer--without the
signal the flight would have begun--when on 24th January the brief
message arrived: "General Gordon is coming to Khartoum."The panic ceased, confidence was
restored, the apathy of the Cairo authorities became a matter of no
importance, for England had sent her greatest name as a pledge of her
intended action, and the unreliable and insufficient garrison pulled
itself together for one of the most honourable and brilliant defences
in the annals of military sieges.Two months had
been wasted, and, as Mr Power said, "the fellows in Lucknow did not
look more anxiously for Colin Campbell than we are looking for
Gordon."Gordon, ever mindful of the importance of time, and fully
impressed with the sense of how much had been lost by delay, did not
let the grass grow under his feet, and after his two days' delay at
Cairo sent a message that he hoped to reach Khartoum in eighteen days.Mr Power's comment on that message is as follows: "Twenty-four days
is the shortest time from Cairo to Khartoum on record; Gordon says he
will be here in eighteen days; but he travels like a whirlwind."As a
matter of fact, Gordon took twenty days' travelling, besides the two
days he passed at Berber.He thus reached Khartoum on 18th February,
and four days later Colonel de Coetlogon started for Cairo.The entry of Gordon into Khartoum was marked by a scene of
indescribable enthusiasm and public confidence.The whole population,
men, women, and children, turned out to welcome him as a conqueror and
a deliverer, although he really came in his own person merely to cope
with a desperate situation.The women threw themselves on the ground
and struggled to kiss his feet; in the confusion Gordon was several
times pushed down; and this remarkable demonstration of popular
confidence and affection was continued the whole way from the
landing-place to the _Hukumdaria_ or Palace.This greeting was the
more remarkable because it was clear that Gordon had brought no
troops--only one white officer--and it soon became known that he had
brought no money.Even the Mahdi himself made his contribution to the
general tribute, by sending General Gordon on his arrival a formal
_salaam_ or message of respect.Thus hailed on all hands as the one
pre-eminently good man who had been associated with the Soudan, Gordon
addressed himself to the hard task he had undertaken, which had been
rendered almost hopeless of achievement by the lapse of time, past
errors, and the blindness of those who should have supported him.Difficult as it had been all along, it was rendered still more
difficult by the decisive defeat of Baker Pasha and an Egyptian force
of 4000 men at Tokar, near Souakim.This victory was won by Osman
Digma, who had been sent by the Mahdi to rouse up the Eastern Soudan
at the time of the threatened Hicks expedition.The result showed that
the Mahdi had discovered a new lieutenant of great military capacity
and energy, and that the Eastern Soudan was for the time as hopelessly
lost to Egypt as Kordofan and Darfour.The first task to which Gordon addressed himself was to place Khartoum
and the detached work at Omdurman on the left bank of the White Nile
in a proper state of defence, and he especially supervised the
establishment of telegraphic communication between the Palace and the
many outworks, so that at a moment's notice he might receive word of
what was happening.His own favourite position became the flat roof of
this building, whence with his glass he could see round for many
miles.He also laid in considerable stores of provisions by means of
his steamers, in which he placed the greatest faith.In all these
matters he was ably and energetically assisted by Colonel Stewart; and
beyond doubt the other Europeans took some slight share in the
incessant work of putting Khartoum in a proper state of defence; but
even with this relief, the strain, increased by constant alarms of the
Mahdi's hostile approach, was intense, and Mr Power speaks of Gordon
as nearly worn out with work before he had been there a month.When Gordon went to the Soudan his principal object was to effect the
evacuation of the country, and to establish there some administration
which would be answerable for good order and good neighbourship.If
the Mahdi had been a purely secular potentate, and not a fanatical
religious propagandist, it would have been a natural and feasible
arrangement to have come to terms with him as the conqueror of the
country.But the basis of the Mahdi's power forbade his being on terms
with anyone.If he had admitted the equal rights of Egypt and the
Khedive at any point, there would have been an end to his heavenly
mission, and the forces he had created out of the simple but
deep-rooted religious feelings of the Mahommedan clans of the Soudan
would soon have vanished.It is quite possible that General Gordon had
in his first views on the Mahdist movement somewhat undervalued the
forces created by that fanaticism, and that the hopes and opinions he
first expressed were unduly optimistic.If so, it must be allowed that
he lost not a moment in correcting them, and within a week of his
arrival at Khartoum he officially telegraphed to Cairo, that "if Egypt
is to be quiet the Mahdi must be smashed up."When the British Government received that message, as they did in a
few days, with, moreover, the expression of supporting views by Sir
Evelyn Baring, they ought to have reconsidered the whole question of
the Gordon mission, and to have defined their own policy.The
representative they had sent on an exceptional errand to relieve and
bring back a certain number of distressed troops, and to arrange if he
could for the formation of a new government through the notabilities
and ancient families, reports at an early stage of his mission that in
his opinion there is no solution of the difficulty, save by resorting
to offensive measures against the Mahdi as the disturber of the peace,
not merely for that moment, but as long as he had to discharge the
divine task implied by his title.As it was of course obvious that
Gordon single-handed could not take the field, the conclusion
necessarily followed that he would require troops, and the whole
character of his task would thus have been changed.In face of that
absolute _volte-face_, from a policy of evacuation and retreat to one
of retention and advance, for that is what it signified, the
Government would have been justified in recalling Gordon, but as they
did not do so, they cannot plead ignorance of his changed opinion, or
deny that, at the very moment he became acquainted with the real state
of things at Khartoum, he hastened to convey to them his decided
conviction that the only way out of the difficulty was to "smash up
the Mahdi."All his early messages show that there had been a change, or at least
a marked modification, in his opinions.At Khartoum he saw more
clearly than in Cairo or in London the extreme gravity of the
situation, and the consequences to the tranquillity of Lower Egypt
that would follow from the abandonment of Khartoum to the Mahdi.He
therefore telegraphed on the day of his arrival these words: "To
withdraw without being able to place a successor in my seat would be
the signal for general anarchy throughout the country, which, though
all Egyptian element were withdrawn, would be a misfortune, and
inhuman."In the same message he repeated his demand for the services
of Zebehr, through whom, as has been shown, he thought he might be
able to cope with the Mahdi.Yet their very refusal to comply with
that reiterated request should have made the authorities more willing
and eager to meet the other applications and suggestion of a man who
had thrust himself into a most perilous situation at their bidding,
and for the sake of the reputation of his country.It must be recorded
with feelings of shame that it had no such effect, and that apathy and
indifference to the fate of its gallant agent were during the first
few months the only characteristics of the Government policy.At the same period all Gordon's telegrams and despatches showed that
he wanted reinforcements to some small extent, and at least military
demonstrations along his line of communication with Egypt to prove
that he possessed the support of his Government, and that he had only
to call upon it to send troops, and they were there to come.He,
naturally enough, treated as ridiculous the suggestion that he had
bound himself to do the whole work without any support; and fully
convinced that he had only to summon troops for them to be sent him in
the moderate strength he alone cared for, he issued a proclamation in
Khartoum, stating that "British troops are now on their way, and in a
few days will reach Khartoum."He therefore begged for the despatch of
a small force to Wady Halfa, and he went on to declare that it would
be "comparatively easy to destroy the Mahdi" if 200 British troops
were sent to Wady Halfa, and if the Souakim-Berber route were opened
up by Indian-Moslem troops.Failing the adoption of these measures, he
asked leave to raise a sum, by appealing to philanthropists,
sufficient to pay a small Turkish force and carry on a contest for
supremacy with the Mahdi on his own behoof.All these suggestions
were more or less supported by Sir Evelyn Baring, who at last
suggested in an important despatch, dated 28th February, that the
British Government should withdraw altogether from the matter, and
"give full liberty of action to General Gordon and the Khedive's
Government to do what seems best to them."Well would it have been for Gordon and everyone whose reputation was
concerned if this step had been taken, for the Egyptian Government,
the Khedive, his ministers Nubar and Cherif, were opposed to all
surrender, and desired to hold on to Khartoum and the Souakim-Berber
route.But without the courage and resolution to discharge it, the
Government saw the obligation that lay on them to provide for the
security and good government of Egypt, and that if they shirked
responsibility in the Soudan, the independence of Egypt might be
accomplished by its own effort and success.They perceived the
objections to giving Egypt a free hand, but they none the less
abstained from taking the other course of definite and decisive action
on their own initiative.As Gordon quickly saw and tersely expressed:
"You will not let Egypt keep the Soudan, you will not take it
yourself, and you will not permit any other country to occupy it."As if to give emphasis to General Gordon's successive
requests--Zebehr, 200 men to Wady Halfa, opening of route from Souakim
to Berber, presence of English officers at Dongola, and of Indian
cavalry at Berber--telegraphic communication with Khartoum was
interrupted early in March, less than a fortnight after Gordon's
arrival in the town.There was consequently no possible excuse for
anyone ignoring the dangerous position in which General Gordon was
placed.He had gone to face incalculable dangers, but now the success
of Osman Digma and the rising of the riparian tribes threatened him
with that complete isolation which no one had quite expected at so
early a stage after his arrival.It ought, and one would have expected
it, to have produced an instantaneous effect, to have braced the
Government to the task of deciding what its policy should be when
challenged by its own representative to declare it.Gordon himself
soon realised his own position, for he wrote: "I shall be caught in
Khartoum; and even if I was mean enough to escape I have not the power
to do so."After a month's interruption he succeeded in getting the
following message, dated 8th April, through, which is significant as
showing that he had abandoned all hope of being supported by his own
Government:--

     "I have telegraphed to Sir Samuel Baker to make an appeal to
     British and American millionaires to give me L300,000 to engage
     3000 Turkish troops from the Sultan and send them here.This
     would settle the Soudan and Mahdi for ever.For my part, I think
     you (Baring) will agree with me.I do not see the fun of being
     caught here to walk about the streets for years as a dervish with
     sandalled feet.Not that (_D.V._) I will ever be taken alive.It
     would be the climax of meanness after I had borrowed money from
     the people here, had called on them to sell their grain at a low
     price, etc., to go and abandon them without using every effort to
     relieve them, whether those efforts are diplomatically correct or
     not; and I feel sure, whatever you may feel diplomatically, I
     have your support, and that of every man professing himself a
     gentleman, in private."Eight days later he succeeded in getting another message through, to
the following effect:--

     "As far as I can understand, the situation is this.You state
     your intention of not sending any relief up here or to Berber,
     and you refuse me Zebehr.I consider myself free to act according
     to circumstances.I shall hold on here as long as I can, and if I
     can suppress the rebellion I shall do so.If I cannot, I shall
     retire to the Equator and leave you the indelible disgrace of
     abandoning the garrisons of Senaar, Kassala, Berber, and Dongola,
     with the _certainty_ that you will eventually be forced to smash
     up the Mahdi under greater difficulties if you wish to maintain
     peace in, and, indeed, to retain Egypt."Before a silence of five and a half months fell over Khartoum, Gordon
had been able to make three things clear, and of these only one could
be described as having a personal signification, and that was that the
Government, by rejecting all his propositions, had practically
abandoned him to his fate.The two others were that any settlement
would be a work of time, and that no permanent tranquillity could be
attained without overcoming the Mahdi.Immediately on arriving at Khartoum he perceived that the evacuation
of the Soudan, with safety to the garrison and officials, as well as
the preservation of the honour of England and Egypt, would necessarily
be a work of time, and only feasible if certain measures were taken in
his support, which, considerable as they may have appeared at the
moment, were small and costless in comparison with those that had
subsequently to be sanctioned.Six weeks sufficed to show Gordon that
he would get no material help from the Government, and he then began
to look elsewhere for support, and to propound schemes for pacifying
the Soudan and crushing the Mahdi in which England and the Government
would have had no part.Hence his proposal to appeal to wealthy
philanthropists to employ Turkish troops, and in the last resort to
force his way to the Equator and the Congo.Even that avenue of safety
was closed to him by the illusory prospect of rescue held out to him
by the Government at the eleventh hour, when success was hardly
attainable.For the sake of clearness it will be well to give here a brief summary
of the siege during the six months that followed the arrival of
General Gordon and the departure of Colonel Stewart on 10th September.The full and detailed narrative is contained in Colonel Stewart's
Journal, which was captured on board his steamer.This interesting
diary was taken to the Mahdi at Omdurman, and is said to be carefully
preserved in the Treasury.The statement rests on no very sure
foundation, but if true the work may yet thrill the audience of the
English-speaking world.But even without its aid the main facts of the
siege of Khartoum, down at all events to the 14th December, when
Gordon's own diary stops, are sufficiently well known for all the
purposes of history.At a very early stage of the siege General Gordon determined to try
the metal of his troops, and the experiment succeeded to such a
perfect extent that there was never any necessity to repeat it.On
16th March, when only irregular levies and detached bodies of
tribesmen were in the vicinity of Khartoum, he sent out a force of
nearly 1000 men, chiefly Bashi-Bazouks, but also some regulars, with a
fieldpiece and supported by two steamers.The force started at eight
in the morning, under the command of Colonel Stewart, and landed at
Halfiyeh, some miles down the stream on the right bank of the Nile.Here the rebels had established a sort of fortified position, which it
was desirable to destroy, if it could be done without too much loss.The troops were accordingly drawn up for the attack, and the gun and
infantry fire commenced to cover the advance.At this moment about
sixty rebel horsemen came out from behind the stockade and charged the
Bashi-Bazouks, who fired one volley and fled.The horsemen then
charged the infantry drawn up in square, which they broke, and the
retreat to the river began at a run.Discouraging as this was for a
force of all arms to retire before a few horsemen one-twentieth its
number, the disaster was rendered worse and more disheartening by the
conduct of the men, who absolutely refused to fight, marching along
with shouldered arms without firing a shot, while the horsemen picked
off all who straggled from the column.The gun, a considerable
quantity of ammunition, and about sixty men represented the loss of
Gordon's force; the rebels are not supposed to have lost a single man."Nothing could be more dismal than seeing these horsemen, and some men
even on camels, pursuing close to troops who with shouldered arms
plodded their way back."Thus wrote Gordon of the men to whom he had
to trust for a successful defence of Khartoum.His most recent
experience confirmed his old opinion, that the Egyptian and Arab
troops were useless even when fighting to save their own lives, and he
could only rely on the very small body left of black Soudanese, who
fought as gallantly for him as any troops could, and whose loyalty and
devotion to him surpassed all praise.Treachery, it was assumed, had
something to do with the easy overthrow of this force, and two Pashas
were shot for misconduct on return to Khartoum.Having no confidence in the bulk of his force, it is not surprising
that Gordon resorted to every artifice within engineering science to
compensate for the shortcomings of his army.He surrounded
Khartoum--which on one side was adequately defended by the Nile and
his steamers--on the remaining three sides with a triple line of land
mines connected by wires.Often during the siege the Mahdists
attempted to break through this ring, but only to meet with repulse,
accompanied by heavy loss; and to the very last day of the siege they
never succeeded in getting behind the third of these lines.Their
efficacy roused Gordon's professional enthusiasm, and in one passage
he exclaims that these will be the general form of defence in the
future.During the first months of the siege, which began rather in
the form of a loose investment, the Nile was too low to allow of his
using the nine steamers he possessed, but he employed the time in
making two new ones, and in strengthening them all with bulwarks of
iron plates and soft wood, which were certainly bullet-proof.Each of
these steamers he valued as the equivalent of 2000 men.When it is
seen how he employed them the value will not be deemed excessive, and
certainly without them he could not have held Khartoum and baffled all
the assaults of the Mahdi for the greater part of a year.After this experience Gordon would risk no more combats on land, and
on 25th March he dismissed 250 of the Bashi-Bazouks who had behaved so
badly.Absolutely trustworthy statistics are not available as to the
exact number of troops in Khartoum or as to the proportion the Black
Soudanese bore to the Egyptians, but it approximates to the truth to
say that there were about 1000 of the former to 3000 of the latter,
and with other levies during the siege he doubled this total.For
these and a civilian population of nearly 40,000 Gordon computed that
he had provisions for five months from March, and that for at least
two months he would be as safe as in Cairo.By carefully husbanding
the corn and biscuit he was able to make the supply last much longer,
and even to the very end he succeeded in partially replenishing the
depleted granaries of the town.There is no necessity to repeat the
details of the siege during the summer of 1884.They are made up of
almost daily interchanges of artillery fire from the town, and of
rifle fire in reply from the Arab lines.That this was not merely
child's play may be gathered from two of Gordon's protected ships
showing nearly a thousand bullet-marks apiece.Whenever the rebels
attempted to force their way through the lines they were repulsed by
the mines; and the steamers not only inflicted loss on their fighting
men, but often succeeded in picking up useful supplies of food and
grain.No further reverses were reported, because Gordon was most
careful to avoid all risk, and the only misfortunes occurred in
Gordon's rear, when first Berber, through the treachery of the Greek
Cuzzi, and then Shendy passed into the hands of the Mahdists, thus, as
Gordon said, "completely hemming him in."In April a detached force up
the Blue Nile went over to the Mahdi, taking with them a small
steamer, but this loss was of no great importance, as the men were of
what Gordon called "the Arabi hen or hero type," and the steamer could
not force its way past Khartoum and its powerful flotilla.In the four
months from 16th March to 30th July Gordon stated that the total loss
of the garrison was only thirty killed and fifty or sixty wounded,
while half a million cartridges had been fired against the enemy.The
conduct of both the people and garrison had been excellent, and this
was the more creditable, because Gordon was obliged from the very
beginning, owing to the capture of the bullion sent him at Berber, to
make all payments in paper money bearing his signature and seal.During that period the total reinforcement to the garrison numbered
seven men, including Gordon himself, while over 2600 persons had been
sent out of it in safety as far as Berber.The reader will be interested in the following extracts from a letter
written by Colonel Duncan, R.A., M.P., showing the remarkable way in
which General Gordon organised the despatch of these refugees from
Khartoum.The letter is dated 29th November 1886, and addressed to
Miss Gordon:--

     "When your brother, on reaching Khartoum, found that he could
     commence sending refugees to Egypt, I was sent on the 3rd March
     1884 to Assouan and Korosko to receive those whom he sent down.As an instance of your brother's thoughtfulness, I may mention
     that he requested that, if possible, some motherly European woman
     might also be sent, as many of the refugees whom he had to send
     had never been out of the Soudan before, and might feel strange
     on reaching Egypt.A German, Giegler Pasha, who had been in
     Khartoum with your brother before, and who had a German wife, was
     accordingly placed at my disposal, and I stationed them at
     Korosko, where almost all the refugees arrived.I may mention
     that I saw and spoke to every one of the refugees who came down,
     and to many of the women and children.Their references to your
     brother were invariably couched in language of affection and
     gratitude, and the adjective most frequently applied to him was
     'just.'In sending away the people from Khartoum, he sent away
     the Governor and some of the other leading Egyptian officials
     first.I think he suspected they would intrigue; he always had
     more confidence in the people than in the ruling Turks or
     Egyptians.The oldest soldiers, the very infirm, the wounded
     (from Hicks's battles) were sent next, and a ghastly crew they
     were.But the precautions he took for their comfort were very
     complete, and although immediately before reaching me they had to
     cross a very bad part of the desert between Abou Hamed and
     Korosko, they reached me in wonderful spirits.It was touching to
     see the perfect confidence they had that the promises of Gordon
     Pasha would be fulfilled.After the fall of Khartoum, and your
     brother's death, a good many of the Egyptian officers who had
     been with your brother managed to escape, and to come down the
     river disguised in many cases as beggars.I had an opportunity of
     talking to most of them, and there was no collusion, for they
     arrived at different times and by different roads.I remember
     having a talk with one, and when we alluded to your brother's
     death he burst out crying like a child, and said that though he
     had lost his wives and children when Khartoum was taken, he felt
     it as nothing to the loss of 'that just man.'"The letters written at the end of July at Khartoum reached Cairo at
the end of September, and their substance was at once telegraphed to
England.They showed that, while his success had made him think that
after all there might be some satisfactory issue of the siege, he
foresaw that the real ordeal was yet to come."In four months (that is
end of November) river begins to fall; before that time you _must_
settle the Soudan question."So wrote the heroic defender of Khartoum
in words that could not be misunderstood, and those words were in the
hands of the British Ministers when half the period had expired.At
the same time Mr Power wrote: "We can at best hold out but two months
longer."Gordon at least never doubted what their effect would be, for
after what seemed to him a reasonable time had elapsed to enable this
message to reach its destination, he took the necessary steps to
recover Berber, and to send his steamers half-way to meet and assist
the advance of the reinforcement on which he thought from the
beginning he might surely rely.On 10th September all his plans were completed, and Colonel Stewart,
accompanied by a strong force of Bashi-Bazouks and some black
soldiers, with Mr Power and M. Herbin, the French consul, sailed
northwards on five steamers.The first task of this expedition was if
possible, to retake Berber, or, failing that, to escort the _Abbas_
past the point of greatest danger; the second, to convey the most
recent news about Khartoum affairs to Lower Egypt; and the third was
to lend a helping hand to any force that might be coming up the Nile
or across the desert from the Red Sea.Five days after its departure
Gordon knew through a spy that Stewart's flotilla had passed Shendy in
safety, and had captured a valuable Arab convoy.It was not till
November that the truth was known how the ships bombarded Berber, and
passed that place not only in safety, but after causing the rebels
much loss and greater alarm, and then how Stewart and his European
companions went on in the small steamer _Abbas_ to bear the tale of
the wonderful defence of Khartoum to the outer world--a defence which,
wonderful as it was, really only reached the stage of the miraculous
after they had gone and had no further part in it.So far as Gordon's
military skill and prevision could arrange for their safety, he did
so, and with success.When the warships had to return he gave them the
best advice against treachery or ambuscade:--"Do not anchor near the
bank, do not collect wood at isolated spots, trust nobody."If they had paid strict heed to his advice, there
would have been no catastrophe at Dar Djumna.These reflections invest
with much force Gordon's own view of the matter:--"If _Abbas_ was
captured by treachery, then I am not to blame; neither am I to blame
if she struck a rock, for she drew under two feet of water; if they
were attacked and overpowered, then I am to blame."So perfect were
his arrangements that only treachery, aided by Stewart's
over-confidence, baffled them.With regard to the wisdom of the course pursued in thus sending away
all his European colleagues--the Austrian consul Hensall alone
refusing to quit Gordon and his place of duty--opinions will differ to
the end of time, but one is almost inclined to say that they could not
have been of much service to Gordon once their uppermost thought
became to quit Khartoum.The whole story is told very graphically in a
passage of Gordon's own diary:--

     "I determined to send the _Abbas_ down with an Arab captain.Then
     Stewart said he would go if I would exonerate him from deserting
     me.I said, 'You do not desert me.I cannot go; but if you go you
     do great service.'I then wrote him an official; he wanted me to
     write him an order.I said 'No; for, though I fear not
     responsibility, I will not put you in any danger in which I am
     not myself.'I wrote them a letter couched thus:--'_Abbas_ is
     going down; you say you are willing to go in her if I think you
     can do so in honour.You can go in honour, for you can do
     nothing here; and if you go you do me service in telegraphing my
     views.'"There are two points in this matter to which I must draw marked
attention.The suggestion for any European leaving Khartoum came from
M. Herbin, and when Gordon willingly acquiesced, Colonel Stewart asked
leave to do likewise.Mr Power, whose calculation was that provisions
would be exhausted before the end of September, then followed suit,
and not one of these three of the five Europeans in Khartoum seem to
have thought for a moment what would be the position of Gordon left
alone to cope with the danger from which they ran away.The suggestion
as to their going came in every case from themselves.Gordon, in his
thought for others, not merely threw no obstacle in their way, but as
far as he could provided for their safety as if they were a parcel of
women.But he declined all responsibility for their fate, as they went
not by his order but of their own free-will.He gave them his ships,
soldiers, and best counsel.They neglected the last, and were taken in
in a manner that showed less than a child's suspicion, and were
massacred at the very moment they felt sure of safety.It was a cruel
fate, and a harsh Nemesis speedily befell them for doing perhaps the
one unworthy thing of their lives--leaving their solitary companion to
face the tenfold dangers by which he would be beset.But it cannot be
allowed any longer that the onus of this matter should rest in any way
on Gordon.They went because they wanted to go, and he, knowing well
that men with such thoughts would be of no use to him ("you can do
nothing here") let them go, and even encouraged them to do so.Under
the circumstances he preferred to be alone.Colonel Donald Stewart was
a personal friend of mine, and a man whose courage in the ordinary
sense of the word could not be aspersed, but there cannot be two
opinions that he above all the others should not have left his
brother-in-arms alone in Khartoum.After their departure Gordon had to superintend everything himself,
and to resort to every means of husbanding the limited supply of
provisions he had left.He had also to anticipate a more vigorous
attack, for the Mahdi must quickly learn of the departure of the
steamers, the bombardment of Berber, and the favourable chance thus
provided for the capture of Khartoum.Nor was this the worst, for on
the occurrence of the disaster the Mahdi was promptly informed of the
loss of the _Abbas_ and the murder of the Europeans, and it was he
himself who sent in to Gordon the news of the catastrophe, with so
complete a list of the papers on the _Abbas_ as left no ground for
hope or disbelief.Unfortunately, before this bad news reached Gordon,
he had again, on 30th September, sent down to Shendy three
steamers--the _Talataween_, the _Mansourah_, and _Saphia_, with
troops on board, and the gallant Cassim-el-Mousse, there to await the
arrival of the relieving force.He somewhat later reinforced this
squadron with the _Bordeen_; and although one or two of these boats
returned occasionally to Khartoum, the rest remained permanently at
Shendy, and when the English troops reached the Nile opposite that
place all five were waiting them.Without entering too closely into
details, it is consequently correct to say that during the most
critical part of the siege Gordon deprived himself of the co-operation
of these vessels, each of which he valued at 2000 men, simply and
solely because he believed that reinforcements were close at hand, and
that some troops at the latest would arrive before the end of November
1884.As Gordon himself repeatedly said, it would have been far more
just if the Government had told him in March, when he first demanded
reinforcements as a right, that he must shift for himself.Then he
would have kept these boats by him, and triumphantly fought his way in
them to the Equator.But his trust in the Government, notwithstanding
all his experience, led him to weaken his own position in the hope of
facilitating their movements, and he found their aid a broken reed.In
only one passage of his journal does Gordon give expression to this
view, although it was always present to his mind:--"Truly the
indecision of our Government has been, from a military point of view,
a very great bore, for we never could act as if independent; there was
always the chance of their taking action, which hampered us."But in
the telegrams to Sir Evelyn Baring and Mr Egerton, which the
Government never dared to publish, and which are still an official
secret, he laid great stress on this point, and on Sir Evelyn Baring's
message forbidding him to retire to the Equator, so that, if he sought
safety in that direction, he would be indictable on a charge of
desertion.The various positions at Khartoum held by Gordon's force may be
briefly described.First, the town itself, on the left bank of the
Blue Nile, but stretching almost across to the right bank of the White
Nile, protected on the land side by a wall, in front of which was the
triple line of mines, and on the water side by the river and the
steamers.On the right bank of the Blue Nile was the small North Fort.Between the two stretched the island of Tuti, and at each end of the
wall, on the White Nile as well as the Blue, Gordon had stationed a
_santal_ or heavy-armed barge, carrying a gun.Unfortunately, a large
part of the western end of the Khartoum wall had been washed away by
an inundation of the Nile, but the mines supplied a substitute, and so
long as Omdurman Fort was held this weakness in the defences of
Khartoum did not greatly signify.That fort itself lay on the left
bank of the White Nile.It was well built and fairly strong, but the
position was faulty.It lay in a hollow, and the trench of the
extensive camp formed for Hicks's force furnished the enemy with
cover.It was also 1200 yards from the river bank, and when the enemy
became more enterprising it was impossible to keep up communication
with it.In Omdurman Fort was a specially selected garrison of 240
men, commanded by a gallant black officer, Ferratch or Faragalla
Pasha, who had been raised from a subordinate capacity to the
principal command under him by Gordon.Gordon's point of observation
was the flat roof of the Palace, whence he could see everything with
his telescope, and where he placed his best shots to bear on any point
that might seem hard pressed.Still more useful was it for the purpose
of detecting the remissness of his own troops and officers, and often
his telescope showed him sentries asleep at their posts, and officers
absent from the points they were supposed to guard.From the end of March until the close of the siege scarcely a day
passed without the exchange of artillery and rifle fire on one side or
the other of the beleaguered town.On special occasions the Khedive's
garrison would fire as many as forty or even fifty thousand rounds of
Remington cartridges, and the Arab fire was sometimes heavier.This
incessant fire, as the heroic defender wrote in his journal, murdered
sleep, and at last he became so accustomed to it that he could tell by
the sound where the firing was taking place.The most distant points
of the defence, such as the _santal_ on the White Nile and Fort
Omdurman, were two miles from the Palace; and although telegraphic
communication existed with them during the greater part of the siege,
the oral evidence as to the point of attack was often found the most
rapid means of obtaining information.This was still more advantageous
after the 12th of November, for on that day communications were cut
between Khartoum and Omdurman, and it was found impossible to restore
them.The only communications possible after that date were by bugle
and flag.At the time of this severance Gordon estimated that the
garrison of Omdurman had enough water and biscuit for six weeks, and
that there were 250,000 cartridges in the arsenal.Gordon did
everything in his power to aid Ferratch in the defence, and his
remaining steamer, the _Ismailia_, after the grounding of the
_Husseinyeh_ on the very day Omdurman was cut off, was engaged in
almost daily encounters with the Mahdists for that purpose.Owing to
Gordon's incessant efforts, and the gallantry of the garrison led by
Ferratch, Omdurman held out more than two months.It was not until
15th January that Ferratch, with Gordon's leave, surrendered, and then
when the Mahdists occupied the place, General Gordon had the
satisfaction of shelling them out of it, and showing that it was
untenable.The severance of Omdurman from Khartoum was the prelude to fiercer
fighting than had taken place at any time during the earlier stages of
the siege, and although particulars are not obtainable for the last
month of the period, there is no doubt that the struggle was
incessant, and that the fighting was renewed from day to day.It was
then that Gordon missed the ships lying idle at Shendy.If he had had
them Omdurman would not have fallen, nor would it have been so easy
for the Mahdi to transport the bulk of his force from the left to the
right bank of the White Nile, as he did for the final assault on the
fatal 26th January.At the end of October the Mahdi, accompanied by a far more numerous
force than Gordon thought he could raise, described by Slatin as
countless, pitched his camp a few miles south of Omdurman.On 8th
November his arrival was celebrated by a direct attack on the lines
south of Khartoum.The rebels in their fear of the hidden mines, which
was far greater than it need have been, as it was found they had been
buried too deep, resorted to the artifice of driving forward cows, and
by throwing rockets among them Gordon had the satisfaction of
spreading confusion in their ranks, repulsing the attack, and
capturing twenty of the animals.Four days later the rebels made the
desperate attack on Omdurman, when, as stated, communications were
cut, and the _Husseinyeh_ ran aground.In attempting to carry her off
and to check the further progress of the rebels the _Ismailia_ was
badly hit, and the incident was one of those only too frequent at all
stages of the siege, when Gordon wrote: "Every time I hear the gun
fire I have a twitch of the heart of gnawing anxiety for my penny
steamers."At the very moment that these fights were in progress he
wrote, 10th November: "To-day is the day I expected we should have had
some one of the Expedition here;" and he also recorded that we "have
enough biscuit for a month or so"--meaning at the outside six weeks.Throughout the whole of November rumours of a coming British
Expedition were prevalent, but they were of the vaguest and most
contradictory character.On 25th November Gordon learnt that it was
still at Ambukol, 185 miles further away from Khartoum than he had
expected, and his only comment under this acute disappointment was,
"This is lively!"Up to the arrival of the Mahdi daily desertions of his Arab and other
soldiers to Gordon took place, and by these and levies among the
townspeople all gaps in the garrison were more than filled up.Such
was the confidence in Gordon that it more than neutralised all the
intrigues of the Mahdi's agents in the besieged town, and scarcely a
man during the first seven months of the siege deserted him; but after
the arrival of the Mahdi there was a complete change in this respect.In the first place there were no more desertions to Gordon, and then
men began to leave him, partly, no doubt, from fear of the Mahdi, or
awakened fanaticism, but chiefly through the non-arrival of the
British Expedition, which had been so much talked about, yet which
never came.Still to all the enemy's invitations to surrender on the
most honourable terms Gordon gave defiant answers."I am here like
iron, and I hope to see the newly-arrived English;" and when the
situation had become little short of desperate, at the end of the
year, he still, with bitter agony at his heart, proudly rejected all
overtures, and sent the haughty message: "Can hold Khartoum for twelve
years."He had read the truth in
all the papers captured on Stewart's steamer, and he knew that
Gordon's resources were nearly spent.Even some of the messages Gordon
sent out by spies for Lord Wolseley's information fell into his hands,
and on one of these Slatin says it was written: "Can hold Khartoum at
the outside till the end of January."Although Gordon may be
considered to have more than held his own against all the power of the
Mahdi down to the capture of Omdurman Fort on 15th January, the Mahdi
knew that his straits must be desperate, and that unless the
expedition arrived he could not hold out much longer.The first
advance of the English troops on 3rd January across the desert towards
the Nile probably warned the enemy that now was the time to renew the
attack with greater vigour, but it does not seem that there is any
justification for the entirely hypothetical view that at any point the
Mahdi could have seized the unhappy town.Omdurman Fort itself fell,
not to the desperate onset of his Ghazis, but from the want of food
and ammunition, and with Gordon's expressed permission to the
commandant to surrender.Unfortunately the details of the most tragic
part of the siege are missing, but Gordon himself well summed up what
he had done up to the end of October when his position was secure, and
aid, as he thought, was close at hand:--

     "The news of Hicks's defeat was known in Cairo three weeks after
     the event occurred; since that date up to this (29th October
     1884) nine people have come up as reinforcements--myself,
     Stewart, Herbin, Hussein, Tongi, Ruckdi, and three servants, and
     not one penny of money.Of those who came up two, Stewart and
     Herbin, have gone down, Hussein is dead; so six alone remain,
     while we must have sent down over 1500 and 700 soldiers, total
     2200, including the two Pashas, Coetlogon, etc.The regulars, who
     were in arrears of pay for three months when I came, are now only
     owed half a month, while the Bashi-Bazouks are owed only a
     quarter month, and we have some L500 in the Treasury.It is quite
     a miracle.We have lost two battles, suffering severe losses in
     these actions of men and arms, and may have said to have
     scrambled through, for I cannot say we can lay claim to any great
     success during the whole time.I believe we have more ammunition
     (Remington) and more soldiers now than when I came up.We have
     L40,000 in Treasury _in paper_ and L500.When I came up there was
     L5000 in Treasury.We have L15,000 out in the town in paper
     money."At the point (14th December) when the authentic history of the
protracted siege and gallant defence of Khartoum stops, a pause may be
made to turn back and describe what the Government and country which
sent General Gordon on his most perilous mission, and made use of his
extraordinary devotion to the call of duty to extricate themselves
from a responsibility they had not the courage to face, had been doing
not merely to support their envoy, but to vindicate their own honour.The several messages which General Gordon had succeeded in getting
through had shown how necessary some reinforcement and support were at
the very commencement of the siege.The lapse of time, rendered the
more expressive by the long period of silence that fell over what was
taking place in the besieged town, showed, beyond need of
demonstration, the gravity of the case and the desperate nature of the
situation.But a very little of the knowledge at the command of the
Government from a number of competent sources would have enabled it to
foresee what was certain to happen, and to have provided some remedy
for the peril long before the following despairing message from Gordon
showed that the hour when any aid would be useful had almost expired.This was the passage, dated 13th December, in the last (sixth) volume
of the Journal, but the substance of which reached Lord Wolseley by
one of Gordon's messengers at Korti on 31st December:--

     "We are going to send down the _Bordeen_ the day after to-morrow,
     and with her I shall send this Journal._If some effort is not
     made before ten days' time the town will fall._ It is
     inexplicable this delay.If the Expeditionary forces have reached
     the river and met my steamers, one hundred men are all that we
     require just to show themselves.... Even if the town falls under
     the nose of the Expeditionary forces it will not in my opinion
     justify the abandonment of Senaar and Kassala, or of the
     Equatorial Province by H.M.All that is absolutely
     necessary is for fifty of the Expeditionary force to get on board
     a steamer and come up to Halfiyeh, and thus let their presence be
     felt.This is not asking much, but it must happen _at once_, or
     it will (as usual) be too late."The motives which induced Mr Gladstone's Government to send General
Gordon to the Soudan in January 1884 were, as has been clearly shown,
the selfish desire to appease public opinion, and to shirk in the
easiest possible manner a great responsibility.They had no policy at
all, but they had one supreme wish, viz.to cut off the Soudan from
Egypt; and if the Mahdi had only known their wishes and pressed on,
and treated the Khartoum force as he had treated that under Hicks,
there would have been no garrisons to rescue, and that British
Government would have done nothing.It recked nothing of the grave
dangers that would have accrued from the complete triumph of the
Mahdi, or of the outbreak that must have followed in Lower Egypt if
his tide of success had not been checked as it was single-handed by
General Gordon, through the twelve months' defence of Khartoum.Still
it could not quite stoop to the dishonour of abandoning these
garrisons, and of making itself an accomplice to the Mahdi's
butcheries, nor could it altogether turn a deaf ear to the
representations and remonstrances of even such a puppet prince as the
Khedive Tewfik.England was then far more mistress of the situation at
Cairo than she is now, but a helpless refusal to discharge her duty
might have provoked Europe into action at the Porte that would have
proved inconvenient and damaging to her position and reputation.Therefore the Government fell back on General Gordon, and the hope was
even indulged that, under his exceptional reputation, the evacuation
of the Soudan might not only be successfully carried out, but that his
success might induce the public and the world to accept that
abnegation of policy as the acme of wisdom.In all this they were
destined to a complete awakening, and the only matter of surprise is
that they should have sent so well-known a character as General
Gordon, whose independence and contempt for official etiquette and
restraint were no secrets at the Foreign and War Offices, on a mission
in which they required him not only to be as indifferent to the
national honour as they were, but also to be tied and restrained by
the shifts and requirements of an embarrassed executive.At a very early stage of the mission the Government obtained evidence
that Gordon's views on the subject were widely different from theirs.They had evidently persuaded themselves that their policy was Gordon's
policy; and before he was in Khartoum a week he not merely points out
that the evacuation policy is not his but theirs, and that although he
thinks its execution is still possible, the true policy is, "if Egypt
is to be quiet, that the Mahdi must be smashed up."The hopes that had
been based on Gordon's supposed complaisance in the post of
representative on the Nile of the Government policy were thus
dispelled, and it became evident that Gordon, instead of being a tool,
was resolved to be master, so far as the mode of carrying out the
evacuation policy with full regard for the dictates of honour was to
be decided.Nor was this all, or the worst of the revelations made to
the Government in the first few weeks after his arrival at Khartoum.While expressing his willingness and intention to discharge the chief
part of his task, viz.the withdrawal of the garrisons, which was all
the Government cared about, he also descanted on the moral duty and
the inevitable necessity of setting up a provisional government that
should avert anarchy and impose some barrier to the Mahdi's progress.All this was trying to those who only wished to be rid of the whole
matter, but Gordon did not spare their feelings, and phrase by phrase
he revealed what his own policy would be and what his inner wishes,
however repressed his charge might keep them, really were.Having told them that "the Mahdi must be smashed up," he went on to
say that "we cannot hurry over this affair" (the future of the Soudan)
"if we do we shall incur disaster," and again that, although "it is a
miserable country it is joined to Egypt, and it would be difficult to
divorce the two."Within a very few weeks, therefore, the Government
learnt that its own agent was the most forcible and damaging critic of
the policy of evacuation, and that the worries of the Soudan question
for an administration not resolute enough to solve the difficulty in a
thorough manner were increased and not diminished by Gordon's mission.At that point the proposition was made and supported by several
members of the Cabinet that Gordon should be recalled.There is no
doubt that this step would have been taken but for the fear that it
would aggravate the difficulties of the English expedition sent to
Souakim under the command of General Gerald Graham to retrieve the
defeat of Baker Pasha.Failing the adoption of that extreme measure,
which would at least have been straightforward and honest, and
ignoring what candour seemed to demand if a decision had been come to
to render Gordon no support, and to bid him shift for himself, the
Government resorted to the third and least justifiable course of all,
viz.of showing indifference to the legitimate requests of their
emissary, and of putting off definite action until the very last
moment.We have seen that Gordon made several specific demands in the first
six weeks of his stay at Khartoum--that is, in the short period before
communication was cut off.He wanted Zebehr, 200 troops at Berber, or
even at Wady Halfa, and the opening of the route from Souakim to the
Nile.To these requests not one favourable answer was given, and the
not wholly unnatural rejection of the first rendered it more than ever
necessary to comply with the others.They were such as ought to have
been granted, and in anticipation they had been suggested and
discussed before Gordon felt bound to urge them as necessary for the
security of his position at Khartoum.Even Sir Evelyn Baring had
recommended in February the despatch of 200 men to Assouan for the
moral effect, and that was the very reason why Gordon asked, in the
first place, for the despatch of a small British force to at least
Wady Halfa.It is possible that one of the chief reasons for the
Government rejecting all these suggestions, and also, it must be
remembered, doing nothing in their place towards the relief and
support of their representative, may have been the hope that this
treatment would have led him to resign and throw up his mission.They
would then have been able to declare that, as the task was beyond the
powers of General Gordon, they were only coming to the prudent and
logical conclusion in saying that nothing could be done, and that the
garrisons had better come to terms with the Mahdi.Unfortunately for
those who favoured the evasion of trouble as the easiest and best way
out of the difficulty, Gordon had high notions as to what duty
required.No difficulty had terrors for him, and while left at the
post of power and responsibility he would endeavour to show himself
equal to the charge.Yet there can be no doubt that those who sent him would have rejoiced
if he had formally asked to be relieved of the task he had accepted,
and Mr Gladstone stated on the 3rd April that "Gordon was under no
orders and no restraint to stay at Khartoum."A significant answer to
the fact represented in that statement was supplied, when, ten days
later, silence fell on Khartoum, and remained unbroken for more than
five months.But at the very moment that the Prime Minister made that
statement as to Gordon's liberty of movement, the Government knew of
the candid views which he had expressed as to the proper policy for
the Soudan.It should have been apparent that, unless they and their
author were promptly repudiated, and unless the latter was stripped of
his official authority, the Government would, however tardily and
reluctantly, be drawn after its representative into a policy of
intervention in the Soudan, which it, above everything else,
wished to avoid.He told them "time,"
"reinforcements," and a very considerable expenditure was necessary to
honourably carry out their policy of evacuation.They were not
prepared to concede any of these save the last, and even the money
they sent him was lost because they would send it by Berber instead of
Kassala.But they knew that "the order and restraint" which kept
Gordon at Khartoum was the duty he had contracted towards them when he
accepted his mission, and which was binding on a man of his principles
until they chose to relieve him of the task.The fear of public
opinion had more to do with their abstaining from the step of ordering
his recall than the hope that his splendid energy and administrative
power might yet provide some satisfactory issue from the dilemma, for
at the very beginning it was freely given out that "General Gordon
was exceeding his instructions."The interruption of communications with Khartoum at least suspended
Gordon's constant representations as to what he thought the right
policy, as well as his demands for the fulfilment by the Government of
their side of the contract.It was then that Lord Granville seemed to
pluck up heart of grace, and to challenge Gordon's right to remain at
Khartoum.On 23rd April Lord Granville asked for explanation of "cause
of detention."Unfortunately it was not till months later that the
country knew of Gordon's terse and humorous reply, "cause of
detention, these horribly plucky Arabs."Lord Granville, thinking this
despatch not clear enough, followed it up on 17th May by instructing
Mr Egerton, then acting for Sir Evelyn Baring, to send the following
remonstrance to Gordon:

     "As the original plan for the evacuation of the Soudan has been
     dropped, and as aggressive operations cannot be undertaken with
     the countenance of H.M.'s Government, General Gordon is enjoined
     to consider, and either to report upon, or, if possible, to adopt
     at the first proper moment measures for his own removal and for
     that of the Egyptians at Khartoum who have suffered for him, or
     who have served him faithfully, including their wives and
     children, by whatever route he may consider best, having especial
     regard to his own safety and that of the other British subjects."Then followed suggestions and authority to pay so much a head for
refugees safely escorted to Korosko.The comment Gordon made on that,
and similar despatches, to save himself and any part of the garrison
he could, was that he was not so mean as to desert those who had nobly
stood by him and committed themselves on the strength of his word.It is impossible to go behind the collective responsibility of the
Government and to attempt to fix any special responsibility or blame
on any individual member of that Government.The facts as I read them
show plainly that there was a complete abnegation of policy or purpose
on the part of the British Government, that Gordon was then sent as a
sort of stop-gap, and that when it was revealed that he had strong
views and clear plans, not at all in harmony with those who sent him,
it was thought, by the Ministers who had not the courage to recall
him, very inconsiderate and insubordinate of him to remain at his post
and to refuse all the hints given him, that he ought to resign unless
he would execute a _sauve qui peut_ sort of retreat to the frontier.Very harsh things have been said of Mr Gladstone and his Cabinet on
this point, but considering their views and declarations, it is not so
very surprising that Gordon's boldness and originality alarmed and
displeased them.Their radical fault in these early stages of the
question was not that they were indifferent to Gordon's demands, but
that they had absolutely no policy.They could not even come to the
decision, as Gordon wrote, "to abandon altogether and not care what
happens."But all these minor points were merged in a great common national
anxiety when month after month passed during the spring and summer of
1884, and not a single word issued from the tomb-like silence of
Khartoum.People might argue that the worst could not have happened,
as the Mahdi would have been only too anxious to proclaim his triumph
far and wide if Khartoum had fallen.Anxiety may be diminished, but is
not banished, by a calculation of probabilities, and the military
spirit and capacity exhibited by the Mahdi's forces under Osman Digma
in the fighting with General Graham's well-equipped British force at
Teb and Tamanieb revealed the greatness of the peril with which Gordon
had to deal at Khartoum where he had only the inadequate and
untrustworthy garrison described by Colonel de Coetlogon.During the
summer of 1884 there was therefore a growing fear, not only that the
worst news might come at any moment, but that in the most favourable
event any news would reveal the desperate situation to which Gordon
had been reduced, and with that conviction came the thought, not
whether he had exactly carried out what Ministers had expected him to
do, but solely of his extraordinary courage and devotion to his
country, which had led him to take up a thankless task without the
least regard for his comfort or advantage, and without counting the
odds.There was at least one Minister in the Cabinet who was struck by
that single-minded conduct; and as early as April, when his colleagues
were asking the formal question why Gordon did not leave Khartoum, the
Marquis of Hartington, then Minister of War, and now Duke of
Devonshire, began to inquire as to the steps necessary to rescue the
emissary, while still adhering to the policy of the Administration of
which he formed part.During the whole of that summer the present Duke
of Devonshire advocated the special claim of General Gordon on the
Government, whose mandate he had so readily accepted, and urged the
necessity of special measures being taken at the earliest moment to
save the gallant envoy from what seemed the too probable penalty of
his own temerity and devotion.But for his energetic and consistent
representations the steps that were taken--all too late as they
proved--never would have been taken at all, or deferred to such a date
as to let the public see by the event that there was no use in
throwing away money and precious lives on a lost cause.If the first place among those in power--for of my own and other
journalists' efforts in the Press to arouse public opinion and to urge
the Government to timely action it is unnecessary to speak--is due to
the Duke of Devonshire, the second may reasonably be claimed by Lord
Wolseley.This recognition is the more called for here, because the
most careful consideration of the facts has led me to the conclusion,
which I would gladly avoid the necessity of expressing if it were
possible, that Lord Wolseley was responsible for the failure of the
relief expedition.This stage of responsibility has not yet been
reached, and it must be duly set forth that on 24th July Lord
Wolseley, then Adjutant-General, wrote a noble letter, stating that,
as he "did not wish to share the responsibility of leaving Charley
Gordon to his fate," he recommended "immediate action," and "the
despatch of a small brigade of between three and four thousand British
soldiers to Dongola, so that they might reach that place about 15th
October."But even that date was later than it ought to have been,
especially when the necessity of getting the English troops back as
early in the New Year as possible was considered, and in the
subsequent recriminations that ensued, the blame for being late from
the start was sought to be thrown on the badness of the Nile flood
that year.General Gordon himself cruelly disposed of that theory or
excuse when he wrote, "It was not a bad Nile; quite an average one.Still, Lord Wolseley must not be
robbed of the credit of having said on 24th July that an expedition
was necessary to save Gordon, "his old friend and Crimean comrade,"
towards whom Wolseley himself had contracted a special moral
obligation for his prominent share in inducing him to accept the very
mission that had already proved so full of peril.In short, if the
plain truth must be told, Lord Wolseley was far more responsible for
the despatch of General Gordon to Khartoum than Mr Gladstone.The result of the early representations of the Duke of Devonshire, and
the definite suggestion of Lord Wolseley, was that the Government gave
in when the public anxiety became so great at the continued silence of
Khartoum, and acquiesced in the despatch of an expedition to relieve
General Gordon.Having once made the concession, it must be allowed
that they showed no niggard spirit in sanctioning the expedition and
the proposals of the military authorities.The sum of ten millions was
devoted to the work of rescuing Gordon by the very persons who had
rejected his demands for the hundredth part of that total.Ten
thousand men selected from the _elite_ of the British army were
assigned to the task for which he had begged two hundred men in vain.It is impossible here to enter closely into the causes which led to
the expansion of the three or four thousand British infantry into a
special corps of ten thousand fighting men, picked from the crack
regiments of the army, and composed of every arm of the service
compelled to fight under unaccustomed conditions.The local
authorities--in particular Major Kitchener, now the Sirdar of the
Egyptian army, who is slowly recovering from the Mahdi the provinces
which should never have been left in his possession--protested that
the expedition should be a small one, and if their advice had been
taken the cost would have been about one-fourth that incurred, and the
force would have reached Khartoum by that 11th November on which
Gordon expected to see the first man of it.But Major Kitchener,
although, as Gordon wrote, "one of the few really first-class officers
in the British army," was only an individual, and his word did not
possess a feather's weight before the influence of the Pall Mall band
of warriors who have farmed out our little wars--India, of course,
excepted--of the last thirty years for their own glorification.So
great a chance of fame as "the rescue of Gordon" was not to be left to
some unknown brigadiers, or to the few line regiments, the proximity
of whose stations entitled them to the task.That would be neglecting
the favours of Providence.For so noble a task the control of the most
experienced commander in the British army would alone suffice, and
when he took the field his staff had to be on the extensive scale that
suited his dignity and position.As there would be some reasonable
excuse for the dispensation of orders and crosses from a campaign
against a religious leader who had not yet known defeat, any friend
might justly complain if he was left behind.To justify so brilliant a
staff, no ordinary British force would suffice.Therefore our
household brigade, our heavy cavalry, and our light cavalry were
requisitioned for their best men, and these splendid troops were
drafted and amalgamated into special corps--heavy and light
camelry--for work that would have been done far better and more
efficiently by two regiments of Bengal Lancers.If all this effort and
expenditure had resulted in success, it would be possible to keep
silent and shrug one's shoulders; but when the mode of undertaking
this expedition can be clearly shown to have been the direct cause of
its failure, silence would be a crime.When Lord Wolseley told the
soldiers at Korti on their return from Metemmah, "It was not _your_
fault that Gordon has perished and Khartoum fallen," the positiveness
of his assurance may have been derived from the inner conviction of
his own stupendous error.The expedition was finally sanctioned in August, and the news of its
coming was known to General Gordon in September, before, indeed, his
own despatches of 31st July were received in London, and broke the
suspense of nearly half a year.He thought that only a small force was
coming, under the command of Major-General Earle, and he at once, as
already described, sent his steamers back to Shendy, there to await
the troops and convey them to Khartoum.He seems to have calculated
that three months from the date of the message informing him of the
expedition would suffice for the conveyance of the troops as far as
Berber or Metemmah, and at that rate General Earle would have arrived
where his steamers awaited him early in November.Gordon's views as to
the object of the expedition, which somebody called the Gordon Relief
Expedition, were thus clearly expressed:--

     "I altogether decline the imputation that the projected
     expedition has come to relieve me.It has come to save our
     National honour in extricating the garrisons, etc., from a
     position in which our action in Egypt has placed these garrisons.As for myself, I could make good my retreat at any moment, if I
     wished.Now realise what would happen if this first relief
     expedition was to bolt, and the steamers fell into the hands of
     the Mahdi.This second relief expedition (for the honour of
     England engaged in extricating garrisons) would be somewhat
     hampered.We, the first and second expeditions, are equally
     engaged for the honour of England.I came up
     to extricate the garrison, and failed.Earle comes up to
     extricate garrisons, and I hope succeeds.Earle does not come to
     extricate me.The extrication of the garrisons was supposed to
     affect our "National honour."If Earle succeeds, the "National
     honour" thanks him, and I hope recommends him, but it is
     altogether independent of me, who, for failing, incurs its blame.I am not _the rescued lamb_, and I will not be."Lord Wolseley, still possessed with the idea that, now that an
expedition had been sanctioned, the question of time was not of
supreme importance, and that the relieving expedition might be carried
out in a deliberate manner, which would be both more effective and
less exposed to risk, did not reach Cairo till September, and had only
arrived at Wady Halfa on 8th October, when his final instructions
reached him in the following form:--"The primary object of your
expedition is to bring away General Gordon and Colonel Stewart, and
you are not to advance further south than necessary to attain that
object, and when it has been secured, no further offensive operations
of any kind are to be undertaken."It had,
however, determined to leave the garrisons to their fate, despite the
National honour being involved, at the very moment that it sanctioned
an enormous expenditure to try and save the lives of its
long-neglected representatives, Gordon and Colonel Stewart.With
extraordinary shrewdness, Gordon detected the hollowness of its
purpose, and wrote:--"I very much doubt what is really going to be the
policy of our Government, even now that the Expedition is at Dongola,"
and if they intend ratting out, "the troops had better not come beyond
Berber till the question of what will be done is settled."The receipt of Gordon's and Power's despatches of July showed that
there were, at the time of their being written, supplies for four
months, which would have carried the garrison on till the end of
November.As the greater part of that period had expired when these
documents reached Lord Wolseley's hands, it was quite impossible to
doubt that time had become the most important factor of all in the
situation.The chance of being too late would even then have presented
itself to a prudent commander, and, above all, to a friend hastening
to the rescue of a friend.The news that Colonel Stewart and some
other Europeans had been entrapped and murdered near Merowe, which
reached the English commander from different sources before Gordon
confirmed it in his letters, was also calculated to stimulate, by
showing that Gordon was alone, and had single-handed to conduct the
defence of a populous city.Hard on the heels of that intelligence
came Gordon's letter of 4th November to Lord Wolseley, who received it
at Dongola on 14th of the same month.The letter was a long one, but
only two passages need be quoted:--"At Metemmah, waiting your orders,
are five steamers with nine guns."Did it not occur to anyone how
greatly, at the worst stage of the siege, Gordon had thus weakened
himself to assist the relieving expedition?Even for that reason there
was not a day or an hour to be lost.But the letter contained a worse and more alarming passage:--"We can
hold out forty days with ease; after that it will be difficult."Forty
days would have meant till 14th December, one month ahead of the day
Lord Wolseley received the news, but the message was really more
alarming than the form in which it was published, for there is no
doubt that the word "difficult" is the official rendering of Gordon's,
a little indistinctly written, word "desperate."In face of that
alarming message, which only stated facts that ought to have been
surmised, if not known, it was no longer possible to pursue the
leisurely promenade up the Nile, which was timed so as to bring the
whole force to Khartoum in the first week of March.Rescue by the most
prominent general and swell troops of England at Easter would hardly
gratify the commandant and garrison starved into surrender the
previous Christmas, and that was the exact relationship between
Wolseley's plans and Gordon's necessities.The date at which Gordon's supplies would be exhausted varied not from
any miscalculation, but because on two successive occasions he
discovered large stores of grain and biscuits, which had been stolen
from the public granaries before his arrival.The supplies that would
all have disappeared in November were thus eked out, first till the
middle of December, and then finally till the end of January, but
there is no doubt that they would not have lasted as long as they did
if in the last month of the siege he had not given the civil
population permission to leave the doomed town.From any and from
every point of view, there was not the shadow of an excuse for a
moment's delay after the receipt of that letter on 14th November.With the British Exchequer at a commander's back, it is easy to
organise an expedition on an elaborate scale, and to carry it out with
the nicety of perfection, but for the realisation of these ponderous
plans there is one thing more necessary, and that is time.I have no
doubt if Gordon's letter had said "granaries full, can hold out till
Easter," that Lord Wolseley's deliberate march--Cairo, September 27;
Wady Halfa, October 8; Dongola, November 14; Korti, December 30;
Metemmah any day in February, and Khartoum, March 3, and those were
the approximate dates of his grand plan of campaign--would have been
fully successful, and held up for admiration as a model of skill.Unfortunately, it would not do for the occasion, as Gordon was on the
verge of starvation and in desperate straits when the rescuing force
reached Dongola.It is not easy to alter the plan of any campaign, nor
to adapt a heavy moving machine to the work suitable for a light one.To feed 10,000 British soldiers on the middle Nile was alone a feat of
organisation such as no other country could have attempted, but the
effort was exhausting, and left no reserve energy to despatch that
quick-moving battalion which could have reached Gordon's steamers
early in December, and would have reinforced the Khartoum garrison,
just as Havelock and Outram did the Lucknow Residency.Dongola is only 100 miles below Debbeh, where the intelligence
officers and a small force were on that 14th November; Ambukol,
specially recommended by Gordon as the best starting-point, is less
than fifty miles, and Korti, the point selected by Lord Wolseley, is
exactly that distance above Debbeh.The Bayuda desert route by the
Jakdul Wells to Metemmah is 170 miles.At Metemmah were the five
steamers with nine guns to convoy the desperately needed succour to
Khartoum.The energy expended on the despatch of 10,000 men up 150
miles of river, if concentrated on 1000 men, must have given a
speedier result, but, as the affair was managed, the last day of the
year 1884 was reached before there was even that small force ready to
make a dash across the desert for Metemmah.The excuses made for this, as the result proved, fatal delay of taking
six weeks to do what--the forward movement from Dongola to Korti, not
of the main force, but of 1000 men--ought to have been done in one
week, were the dearth of camels, the imperfect drill of the camel
corps, and, it must be added, the exaggerated fear of the Mahdi's
power.When it was attempted to quicken the slow forward movement of
the unwieldy force confusion ensued, and no greater progress was
effected than if things had been left undisturbed.The erratic policy
in procuring camels caused them at the critical moment to be not
forthcoming in anything approaching the required numbers, and this
difficulty was undoubtedly increased by the treachery of Mahmoud
Khalifa, who was the chief contractor we employed.Even when the
camels were procured, they had to be broken in for regular work, and
the men accustomed to the strange drill and mode of locomotion.The
last reason perhaps had the most weight of all, for although the Mahdi
with all his hordes had been kept at bay by Gordon single-handed, Lord
Wolseley would risk nothing in the field.Probably the determining
reason for that decision was that the success of a small force would
have revealed how absolutely unnecessary his large and costly
expedition was.Yet events were to show beyond possibility of
contraversion that this was the case, for not less than two-thirds of
the force were never in any shape or form actively employed, and, as
far as the fate of Gordon went, might just as well have been left at
home.They had, however, to be fed and provided for at the end of a
line of communication of over 1200 miles.Still, notwithstanding all these delays and disadvantages, a
well-equipped force of 1000 men was ready on 30th December to leave
Korti to cross the 170 miles of the Bayuda desert.That route was well
known and well watered.There were wells at, at least, five places,
and the best of these was at Jakdul, about half-way across.The
officer entrusted with the command was Major-General Sir Herbert
Stewart, an officer of a gallant disposition, who was above all others
impressed with the necessity of making an immediate advance, with the
view of throwing some help into Khartoum.Unfortunately he was
trammelled by his instructions, which were to this effect--he was to
establish a fort at Jakdul; but if he found an insufficiency of water
there he was at liberty to press on to Metemmah.His action was to be
determined by the measure of his own necessities, not of Gordon's, and
so Lord Wolseley arranged throughout.He reached that place with his
1100 fighting men, but on examining the wells and finding them full,
he felt bound to obey the orders of his commander, viz.to establish
the fort, and then return to Korti for a reinforcement.It was a case
when Nelson's blind eye might have been called into requisition, but
even the most gallant officers are not Nelsons.The first advance of General Stewart to Jakdul, reached on 3rd January
1885, was in every respect a success.It was achieved without loss,
unopposed, and was quite of the nature of a surprise.The British
relieving force was at last, after many months' report, proved to be
a reality, and although late, it was not too late.If General Stewart
had not been tied by his instructions, but left a free hand, he would
undoubtedly have pressed on, and a reinforcement of British troops
would have entered Khartoum even before the fall of Omdurman.But it
must be recorded also that Sir Herbert Stewart was not inspired by the
required flash of genius.He paid more deference to the orders of Lord
Wolseley than to the grave peril of General Gordon.General Stewart returned to Korti on the 7th January, bringing with
him the tired camels, and he found that during his absence still more
urgent news had been received from Gordon, to the effect that if aid
did not come within ten days from the 14th December, the place might
fall, and that under the nose of the expedition.The native who
brought this intimation arrived at Korti the day after General Stewart
left, but a messenger could easily have caught him up and given him
orders to press on at all cost.It was not realised at the time, but
the neglect to give that order, and the rigid adherence to a
preconceived plan, proved fatal to the success of the whole
expedition.The first advance of General Stewart had been in the nature of a
surprise, but it aroused the Mahdi to a sense of the position, and the
subsequent delay gave him a fortnight to complete his plans and assume
the offensive.On 12th January--that is, nine days after his first arrival at
Jakdul--General Stewart reached the place a second time with the
second detachment of another 1000 men--the total fighting strength of
the column being raised to about 2300 men.For whatever errors had
been committed, and their consequences, the band of soldiers assembled
at Jakdul on that 12th of January could in no sense be held
responsible.Without making any invidious comparisons, it may be
truthfully said that such a splendid fighting force was never
assembled in any other cause, and the temper of the men was strung to
a high point of enthusiasm by the thought that at last they had
reached the final stage of the long journey to rescue Gordon.A number
of causes, principally the fatigue of the camels from the treble
journey between Korti and Jakdul, made the advance very slow, and five
days were occupied in traversing the forty-five miles between Jakdul
and the wells at Abou Klea, themselves distant twenty miles from
Metemmah.On the morning of 17th January it became clear that the
column was in presence of an enemy.At the time of Stewart's first arrival at Jakdul there were no hostile
forces in the Bayuda desert.At Berber was a considerable body of the
Mahdi's followers, and both Metemmah and Shendy were held in his name.At the latter place a battery or small fort had been erected, and in
an encounter between it and Gordon's steamers one of the latter had
been sunk, thus reducing their total to four.But there were none of
the warrior tribes of Kordofan and Darfour at any of these places, or
nearer than the six camps which had been established round Khartoum.The news of the English advance made the Mahdi bestir himself, and as
it was known that the garrison of Omdurman was reduced to the lowest
straits, and could not hold out many days, the Mahdi despatched some
of his best warriors of the Jaalin, Degheim, and Kenana tribes to
oppose the British troops in the Bayuda desert.It was these men who
opposed the further advance of Sir Herbert Stewart's column at Abou
Klea.It is unnecessary to describe the desperate assault these
gallant warriors made on the somewhat cumbrous and ill-arranged square
of the British force, or the ease and tremendous loss with which these
fanatics were beaten off, and never allowed to come to close quarters,
save at one point.The infantry soldiers, who formed two sides of the
square, signally repulsed the onset, not a Ghazi succeeded in getting
within a range of 300 yards; but on another side, cavalrymen, doing
infantry soldiers' unaccustomed work, did not adhere to the strict
formation necessary, and trained for the close _melee_, and with the
_gaudia certaminis_ firing their blood, they recklessly allowed the
Ghazis to come to close quarters, and their line of the square was
impinged upon.In that close fighting, with the Heavy Camel Corps men
and the Naval Brigade, the Blacks suffered terribly, but they also
inflicted loss in return.Of a total loss on the British side of
sixty-five killed and sixty-one wounded, the Heavy Camel Corps lost
fifty-two, and the Sussex Regiment, performing work to which it was
thoroughly trained, inflicted immense loss on the enemy at hardly any
cost to itself.Among the slain was the gallant Colonel Fred.Burnaby,
one of the noblest and gentlest, as he was physically the strongest,
officers in the British army.There is no doubt that signal as was
this success, it shook the confidence of the force.The men were
resolute to a point of ferocity, but the leaders' confidence in
themselves and their task had been rudely tried; and yet the breaking
of the square had been clearly due to a tactical blunder, and the
inability of the cavalry to adapt themselves to a strange position.On the 18th January the march, rendered slower by the conveyance of
the wounded, was resumed, but no fighting took place on that day,
although it was clear that the enemy had not been dispersed.On the
19th, when the force had reached the last wells at Abou Kru or Gubat,
it became clear that another battle was to be fought.One of the first
shots seriously wounded Sir Herbert Stewart, and during the whole of
the affair many of our men were carried off by the heavy rifle fire of
the enemy.Notwithstanding that our force fought under many
disadvantages and was not skilfully handled, the Mahdists were driven
off with terrible loss, while our force had thirty-six killed and one
hundred and seven wounded.Notwithstanding these two defeats, the
enemy were not cowed, and held on to Metemmah, in which no doubt those
who had taken part in the battles were assisted by a force from
Berber.The 20th January was wasted in inaction, caused by the large
number of wounded, and when on 21st January Metemmah was attacked, the
Mahdists showed so bold a front that Sir Charles Wilson, who succeeded
to the command on Sir Herbert Stewart being incapacitated by his, as
it proved, mortal wound, drew off his force.This was the more
disappointing, because Gordon's four steamers arrived during the
action and took a gallant part in the attack.It was a pity for the
effect produced that that attack should have been distinctly
unsuccessful.The information the captain of these steamers, the
gallant Cassim el Mousse, gave about Gordon's position was alarming.He stated that Gordon had sent him a message informing him that if aid
did not come in ten days from the 14th December his position would be
desperate, and the volumes of his journal which he handed over to Sir
Charles Wilson amply corroborated this statement--the very last entry
under that date being these memorable words: "Now, mark this, if the
Expeditionary Force--and I ask for no more than 200 men--does not come
in ten days, _the town may fall_, and I have done my best for the
honour of our country.The other letters handed over by Cassim el Mousse amply bore out the
view that a month before the British soldiers reached the last stretch
of the Nile to Khartoum Gordon's position was desperate.In one to his
sister he concluded, "I am quite happy, thank God, and, like Lawrence,
have tried to do my duty," and in another to his friend Colonel
Watson: "I think the game is up, and send Mrs Watson, yourself, and
Graham my adieux.We may expect a catastrophe in the town in or after
ten days.This would not have happened (if it does happen) if our
people had taken better precautions as to informing us of their
movements, but this is'spilt milk.'"In face of these documents,
which were in the hands of Sir Charles Wilson on 21st January, it is
impossible to agree with his conclusion in his book "Korti to
Khartoum," that "the delay in the arrival of the steamers at Khartoum
was unimportant" as affecting the result.Every hour, every minute,
had become of vital importance.If the whole Jakdul column had been
destroyed in the effort, it was justifiable to do so as the price of
reinforcing Gordon, so that he could hold out until the main body
under Lord Wolseley could arrive.I am not one of those who think
that Sir Charles Wilson, who only came on the scene at the last
moment, should be made the scapegoat for the mistakes of others in the
earlier stages of the expedition, and I hold now, as strongly as when
I wrote the words, the opinion that, "in the face of what he did, any
suggestion that he might have done more would seem both ungenerous and
untrue."Still the fact remains that on 21st January there was left a
sufficient margin of time to avert what actually occurred at daybreak
on the 26th, for the theory that the Mahdi could have entered the town
one hour before he did was never a serious argument, while the
evidence of Slatin Pasha strengthens the view that Gordon was at the
last moment only overcome by the Khalifa's resorting to a surprise.On
one point of fact Sir Charles Wilson seems also to have been in error.He fixes the fall of Omdurman at 6th January, whereas Slatin, whose
information on the point ought to be unimpeachable, states that it did
not occur until the 15th of that month.When Sir Herbert Stewart had fought and won the battle of Abou Klea,
it was his intention on reaching the Nile, as he expected to do the
next day, to put Sir Charles Wilson on board one of Gordon's own
steamers and send him off at once to Khartoum.The second battle and
Sir Herbert Stewart's fatal wound destroyed that project.But this
plan might have been adhered to so far as the altered circumstances
would allow.Sir Charles Wilson had succeeded to the command, and many
matters affecting the position of the force had to be settled before
he was free to devote himself to the main object of the dash forward,
viz.the establishment of communications with Gordon and Khartoum.As
the consequence of that change in his own position, it would have been
natural that he should have delegated the task to someone else, and in
Lord Charles Beresford, as brave a sailor as ever led a cutting-out
party, there was the very man for the occasion.Unfortunately, Sir
Charles Wilson did not take this step for, as I believe, the sole
reason that he was the bearer of an important official letter to
General Gordon, which he did not think could be entrusted to any other
hands.But for that circumstance it is permissible to say that one
steamer--there was more than enough wood on the other three steamers
to fit one out for the journey to Khartoum--would have sailed on the
morning of the 22nd, the day after the force sheered off from
Metemmah, and, at the latest, it would have reached Khartoum on
Sunday, the 25th, just in time to avert the catastrophe.But as it was done, the whole of the 22nd and 23rd were taken up in
preparing two steamers for the voyage, and in collecting scarlet coats
for the troops, so that the effect of real British soldiers coming up
the Nile might be made more considerable.on Saturday, the
24th, Sir Charles Wilson at last sailed with the two steamers,
_Bordeen_ and _Talataween_, and it was then quite impossible for the
steamers to cover the ninety-five miles to Khartoum in time.Moreover,
the Nile had, by this time, sunk to such a point of shallowness that
navigation was specially slow and even dangerous.The Shabloka
cataract was passed at 3 P.M.on the afternoon of Sunday; then the
_Bordeen_ ran on a rock, and was not got clear till 9 P.M.On the 27th, Halfiyeh, eight miles from Khartoum, was
reached, and the Arabs along the banks shouted out that Gordon was
killed and Khartoum had fallen.Still Sir Charles Wilson went on past
Tuti Island, until he made sure that Khartoum had fallen and was in
the hands of the dervishes.Then he ordered full steam down stream
under as hot a fire as he ever wished to experience, Gordon's black
gunners working like demons at their guns.On the 29th the
_Talataween_ ran on a rock and sank, its crew being taken on board the
_Bordeen_.Two days later the _Bordeen_ shared the same fate, but the
whole party was finally saved on the 4th February by a third steamer,
brought up by Lord Charles Beresford.But these matters, and the
subsequent progress of the Expedition which had so ignominiously
failed, have no interest for the reader of Gordon's life.It failed to
accomplish the object which alone justified its being sent, and, it
must be allowed, that it accepted its failure in a very tame and
spiritless manner.Even at the moment of the British troops turning
their backs on the goal which they had not won, the fate of Gordon
himself was unknown, although there could be no doubt as to the main
fact that the protracted siege of Khartoum had terminated in its
capture by the cruel and savage foe, whom it, or rather Gordon, had so
long defied.I have referred to the official letter addressed to General Gordon, of
which Sir Charles Wilson was the bearer.That letter has never been
published, and it is perhaps well for its authors that it has not
been, for, however softened down its language was by Lord Wolseley's
intercession, it was an order to General Gordon to resign the command
at Khartoum, and to leave that place without a moment's delay.Had it
been delivered and obeyed (as it might have been, because Gordon's
strength would probably have collapsed at the sight of English
soldiers after his long incarceration), the next official step would
have been to censure him for having remained at Khartoum against
orders.Thus would the primary, and, indeed, sole object of the
Expedition have been attained without regard for the national honour,
and without the discovery of that policy, the want of which was the
only cause of the calamities associated with the Soudan.After the 14th of December there is no trustworthy, or at least,
complete evidence, as to what took place in Khartoum.A copy of one of
the defiant messages Gordon used to circulate for the special purpose
of letting them fall into the hands of the Mahdi was dated 29th of
that month, and ran to the effect, "Can hold Khartoum for years."There was also the final message to the Sovereigns of the Powers,
undated, and probably written, if at all, by Gordon, during the final
agony of the last few weeks, perhaps when Omdurman had fallen.It was
worded as follows:--

     "After salutations, I would at once, calling to mind what I have
     gone through, inform their Majesties, the Sovereigns, of the
     action of Great Britain and the Ottoman Empire, who appointed me
     as Governor-General of the Soudan for the purpose of appeasing
     the rebellion in that country."During the twelve months that I have been here, these two
     Powers, the one remarkable for her wealth, and the other for her
     military force, have remained unaffected by my situation--perhaps
     relying too much on the news sent by Hussein Pasha Khalifa, who
     surrendered of his own accord."Although I, personally, am too insignificant to be taken into
     account, the Powers were bound, nevertheless, to fulfil the
     engagement upon which my appointment was based, so as to shield
     the honour of the Governments."What I have gone through I cannot describe.The Almighty God
     will help me."Although this copy was not in Gordon's own writing, it was brought
down by one of his clerks, who escaped from Khartoum, and he declared
that the original had been sent in a cartridge case to Dongola.The
style is certainly the style of Gordon, and there was no one in the
Soudan who could imitate it.It seems safe, as Sir Henry Gordon did,
to accept it as the farewell message of his brother.Until fresh evidence comes to light, that of Slatin Pasha, then a
chained captive in the Mahdi's camp, is alone entitled to the
slightest credence, and it is extremely graphic.We can well believe
that up to the last moment Gordon continued to send out
messages--false, to deceive the Mahdi, and true to impress Lord
Wolseley.The note of 29th December was one of the former; the little
French note on half a cigarette paper, brought by Abdullah Khalifa to
Slatin to translate early in January, may have been one of the latter.It said:--"Can hold Khartoum at the outside till the end of January."Slatin then describes the fall of Omdurman on 15th January, with
Gordon's acquiescence, which entirely disposes of the assertion that
Ferratch, the gallant defender of that place during two months, was a
traitor, and of how, on its surrender, Gordon's fire from the western
wall of Khartoum prevented the Mahdists occupying it.He also comments
on the alarm caused by the first advance of the British force into the
Bayuda desert, and of the despatch of thousands of the Mahdi's best
warriors to oppose it.Those forces quitted the camp at Omdurman
between 10th and 15th January, and this step entirely disposes of the
theory that the Mahdi held Khartoum in the hollow of his hand, and
could at any moment take it.As late as the 15th of January, Gordon's
fire was so vigorous and successful that the Mahdi was unable to
retain possession of the fort which he had just captured.The story had best be continued in the words used by the witness.Six
days after the fall of Omdurman loud weeping and wailing filled the
Mahdi's camp.As the Mahdi forbade the display of sorrow and grief it
was clear that something most unusual had taken place.Then it came
out that the British troops had met and utterly defeated the tribes,
with a loss to the Mahdists of several thousands.Within the next two
or three days came news of the other defeat at Abou Kru, and the loud
lamentations of the women and children could not be checked.The Mahdi
and his chief emirs, the present Khalifa Abdullah prominent among
them, then held a consultation, and it was decided, sooner than lose
all the fruits of the hitherto unchecked triumph of their cause, to
risk an assault on Khartoum.At night on the 24th, and again on the
25th, the bulk of the rebel force was conveyed across the river to the
right bank of the White Nile; the Mahdi preached them a sermon,
promising them victory, and they were enjoined to receive his remarks
in silence, so that no noise was heard in the beleaguered city.By
this time their terror of the mines laid in front of the south wall
had become much diminished, because the mines had been placed too low
in the earth, and they also knew that Gordon and his diminished force
were in the last stages of exhaustion.Finally, the Mahdi or his
energetic lieutenant decided on one more arrangement, which was
probably the true cause of their success.The Mahdists had always
delivered their attack half an hour after sunrise; on this occasion
they decided to attack half an hour before dawn, when the whole scene
was covered in darkness.Slatin knew all these plans, and as he
listened anxiously in his place of confinement he was startled, when
just dropping off to sleep, by "the deafening discharge of thousands
of rifles and guns; this lasted for a few minutes, then only
occasional rifle shots were heard, and now all was quiet again.Could
this possibly be the great attack on Khartoum?A wild discharge of
firearms and cannon, and in a few minutes complete silence!"Some hours afterwards three black soldiers
approached, carrying in a bloody cloth the head of General Gordon,
which he identified.It is unnecessary to add the gruesome details
which Slatin picked up as to his manner of death from the gossip of
the camp.In this terrible tragedy ended that noble defence of
Khartoum, which, wherever considered or discussed, and for all time,
will excite the pity and admiration of the world.There is no need to dwell further on the terrible end of one of the
purest heroes our country has ever produced, whose loss was national,
but most deeply felt as an irreparable shock, and as a void that can
never be filled up by that small circle of men and women who might
call themselves his friends.Ten years elapsed after the eventful
morning when Slatin pronounced over his remains the appropriate
epitaph, "A brave soldier who fell at his post; happy is he to have
fallen; his sufferings are over!"before the exact manner of Gordon's
death was known, and some even clung to the chance that after all he
might have escaped to the Equator, and indeed it was not till long
after the expedition had returned that the remarkable details of his
single-handed defence of Khartoum became known.Had all these
particulars come out at the moment when the public learnt that
Khartoum had fallen, and that the expedition was to return without
accomplishing anything, it is possible that there would have been a
demand that no Minister could have resisted to avenge his fate; but it
was not till the publication of the journals that the exact character
of his magnificent defence and of the manner in which he was treated
by those who sent him came to be understood and appreciated by the
nation.The lapse of time has been sufficient to allow of a calm judgment
being passed on the whole transaction, and the considerations which I
have put forward with regard to it in the chronicle of events have
been dictated by the desire to treat all involved in the matter with
impartiality.If they approximate to the truth, they warrant the
following conclusions.The Government sent General Gordon to the
Soudan on an absolutely hopeless mission for any one or two men to
accomplish without that support in reinforcements on which General
Gordon thought he could count.General Gordon went to the Soudan, and
accepted that mission in the enthusiastic belief that he could arrest
the Mahdi's progress, and treating as a certainty which did not
require formal expression the personal opinion that the Government,
for the national honour, would comply with whatever demands he made
upon it.As a simple matter of fact, every one of those demands, some
against and some with Sir Evelyn Baring's authority, were rejected.No
incident could show more clearly the imperative need of definite
arrangements being made even with Governments; and in this case the
precipitance with which General Gordon was sent off did not admit of
him or the Government knowing exactly what was in the other's mind.Ostensibly of one mind, their views on the matter in hand were really
as far as the poles asunder.There then comes the second phase of the question--the alleged
abandonment of General Gordon by the Government which enlisted his
services in face of an extraordinary, and indeed unexampled danger and
difficulty.The evidence, while it proves conclusively and beyond
dispute that Mr Gladstone's Government never had a policy with regard
to the Soudan, and that even Gordon's heroism, inspiration, and
success failed to induce them to throw aside their lethargy and take
the course that, however much it may be postponed, is inevitable, does
not justify the charge that it abandoned Gordon to his fate.It
rejected the simplest and most sensible of his propositions, and by
rejecting them incurred an immense expenditure of British treasure and
an incalculable amount of bloodshed; but when the personal danger to
its envoy became acute, it did not abandon him, but sanctioned the
cost of the expedition pronounced necessary to effect his rescue.This
decision, too late as it was to assist in the formation of a new
administration for the Soudan, or to bring back the garrisons, was
taken in ample time to ensure the personal safety and rescue of
General Gordon.In the literal sense of the charge, history will
therefore acquit Mr Gladstone and his colleagues of the abandonment of
General Gordon personally.With regard to the third phase of the question--viz.the failure of
the attempt to rescue General Gordon, which was essentially a
military, and not a political question--the responsibility passes from
the Prime Minister to the military authorities who decided the scope
of the campaign, and the commander who carried it out.In this case,
the individual responsible was the same.Lord Wolseley not only had
his own way in the route to be followed by the expedition, and the
size and importance attached to it, but he was also entrusted with its
personal direction.There is consequently no question of the
sub-division of the responsibility for its failure, just as there
could have been none of the credit for its success.Lord Wolseley
decided that the route should be the long one by the Nile Valley, not
the short one from Souakim to Berber.Lord Wolseley decreed that there
should be no Indian troops, and that the force, instead of being an
ordinary one, should be a picked special corps from the _elite_ of the
British army; and finally Lord Wolseley insisted that there should be
no dash to the rescue of Gordon by a small part of his force, but a
slow, impressive, and overpoweringly scientific advance of the whole
body.The extremity of Gordon's distress necessitated a slight
modification of his plan, when, with qualified instructions, which
practically tied his hands, Sir Herbert Stewart made his first
appearance at Jakdul.It was then known to Lord Wolseley that Gordon was in extremities,
yet when a fighting force of 1100 English troops, of special physique
and spirit, was moved forward with sufficient transport to enable it
to reach the Nile and Gordon's steamers, the commander's instructions
were such as confined him to inaction, unless he disobeyed his orders,
which only Nelsons and Gordons can do with impunity.It is impossible
to explain this extraordinary timidity.Sir Herbert Stewart reached
Jakdul on 3rd January with a force small in numbers, but in every
other respect of remarkable efficiency, and with the camels
sufficiently fresh to have reached the Nile on 7th or 8th January had
it pressed on.The more urgent news that reached Lord Wolseley after
its departure would have justified the despatch of a messenger to urge
it to press on at all costs to Metemmah.In such a manner would a
Havelock or Outram have acted, yet the garrison of the Lucknow
Residency was in no more desperate case than Gordon at Khartoum.It does not need to be a professor of a military academy to declare
that, unless something is risked in war, and especially wars such as
England has had to wage against superior numbers in the East, there
will never be any successful rescues of distressed garrisons.Lord
Wolseley would risk nothing in the advance from Korti to Metemmah,
whence his advance guard did not reach the latter place till the 20th,
instead of the 7th of January.His lieutenant and representative, Sir
Charles Wilson, would not risk anything on the 21st January, whence
none of the steamers appeared at Khartoum until late on the 27th, when
all was over.Each of these statements cannot be impeached, and if so,
the conclusion seems inevitable that in the first and highest degree
Lord Wolseley was alone responsible for the failure to reach Khartoum
in time, and that in a very minor degree Sir Charles Wilson might be
considered blameworthy for not having sent off one of the steamers
with a small reinforcement to Khartoum on the 21st January, before
even he allowed Cassim el Mousse to take any part in the attack on
Metemmah.He could not have done this himself, but he would have had
no difficulty in finding a substitute.When, however, there were
others far more blameworthy, it seems almost unjust to a gallant
officer to say that by a desperate effort he might at the very last
moment have snatched the chestnuts out of the fire, and converted the
most ignominious failure in the military annals of this country into a
creditable success.*       *       *       *       *

The tragic end at Khartoum was not an inappropriate conclusion for the
career of Charles Gordon, whose life had been far removed from the
ordinary experiences of mankind.No man who ever lived was called upon
to deal with a greater number of difficult military and
administrative problems, and to find the solution for them with such
inadequate means and inferior troops and subordinates.In the Crimea
he showed as a very young man the spirit, discernment, energy, and
regard for detail which were his characteristics through life.Those
qualities enabled him to achieve in China military exploits which in
their way have never been surpassed.The marvellous skill, confidence,
and vigilance with which he supplied the shortcomings of his troops,
and provided for the wants of a large population at Khartoum for the
better part of a year, showed that, as a military leader, he was still
the same gifted captain who had crushed the Taeping rebellion twenty
years before.What he did for the Soudan and its people during six
years' residence, at a personal sacrifice that never can be
appreciated, has been told at length; but pages of rhetoric would not
give as perfect a picture as the spontaneous cry of the blacks: "If we
only had a governor like Gordon Pasha, then the country would indeed
be contented.""Such examples are fruitful in the future," said Mr Gladstone in the
House of Commons; and it is as a perfect model of all that was good,
brave, and true that Gordon will be enshrined in the memory of the
great English nation which he really died for, and whose honour was
dearer to him than his life.England may well feel proud of having
produced so noble and so unapproachable a hero.She has had, and she
will have again, soldiers as brave, as thoughtful, as prudent, and as
successful as Gordon.She has had, and she will have again, servants
of the same public spirit, with the same intense desire that not a
spot should sully the national honour.But although this breed is not
extinct, there will never be another Gordon.The circumstances that
produced him were exceptional; the opportunities that offered
themselves for the demonstration of his greatness can never fall to
the lot of another; and even if by some miraculous combination the man
and the occasions arose, the hero, unlike Gordon, would be spoilt by
his own success and public applause.But the qualities which made
Gordon superior not only to all his contemporaries, but to all the
temptations and weaknesses of success, are attainable; and the student
of his life will find that the guiding star he always kept before him
was the duty he owed his country.In that respect, above all others,
he has left future generations of his countrymen a great example._Abbas_, steamer, ii.144;

 Though this exchange teems with a thousand ills,
 Yet 'tis th' example I would deprecate.This treaty fix'd, Rome's honour is no more.Should her degenerate sons be promis'd life,
 Dishonest life, and worthless liberty,
 Her glory, valour, military pride,
 Her fame, her fortitude, her all were lost.What honest captive of them all would wish
 With shame to enter her imperial gates,
 The flagrant scourge of slavery on his back?None, none, my friends, would wish a fate so vile,

 Unstain'd with hostile blood, and poorly sued,
 Through ignominious fear of death, for bondage;

 The liberty, the life of Regulus,
 More than compensates for it._Reg._                   Thou art mistaken.----
 This Regulus is a mere mortal man,
 Yielding apace to all th' infirmities
 Of weak, decaying nature.----I am old,
 Nor can my future, feeble services
 Assist my country much; but mark me well:
 The young fierce heroes you'd restore to Carthage,
 In lieu of this old man, are her chief bulwarks.in vig'rous youth this well-strung arm
 Fought for my country, fought and conquer'd for her:
 That was the time to prize its service high.Now, weak and nerveless, let the foe possess it,
 For it can harm them in the field no more.Let Carthage have the poor degrading triumph
 To close these failing eyes;--but, O my countrymen!Check their vain hopes, and show aspiring Afric

 Preach safety at the price of truth and justice._Reg._ If Rome would thank me, I will teach her how.--Know, Fathers, that these savage Africans
 Thought me so base, so very low of soul,
 That the poor wretched privilege of breathing,
 Would force me to betray my country to them.Have these barbarians any tortures left
 To match the cruelty of such a thought?Arm, arm yourselves, prepare your citizens,
 Snatch your imprison'd eagles from their fanes,
 Fly to the shores of Carthage, force her gates,
 Dye every Roman sword in Punic blood--
 And do such deeds--that when I shall return,
 (As I have _sworn_, and am resolv'd to do,)
 I may behold with joy, reflected back,
 The terrors of your rage in the dire visages
 Of my astonish'd executioners._Ham._ Surprise has chill'd my blood!_Man._ Romans, we must defer th' important question;
 Maturest councils must determine on it.Rest we awhile:----Nature requires some pause
 From high-rais'd admiration.Thou, Hamilcar,
 Shalt shortly know our final resolution.Meantime, we go to supplicate the gods._Man._ Yes, Regulus, I think the danger less
 To lose th' advantage thy advice suggests,
 Than would accrue to Rome in losing thee,
 Whose wisdom might direct, whose valour guard her.Athirst for glory, thou wouldst rush on death,
 And for thy country's sake wouldst greatly perish.Too vast a sacrifice thy zeal requires,
 For Rome must bleed when Regulus expires.[_Exeunt Consul and Senators._

 _Manent_ REGULUS, PUBLIUS, HAMILCAR; _to them
 enter_ ATTILIA _and_ LICINIUS._Ham._ Does Regulus fulfil his promise thus?_Reg._ I've promis'd to return, and I will do it._Lic._                              Ah!and At._ O by this hand we beg----

 _Reg._                             Away!Thanks to Rome's guardian gods I'm yet a slave!And will be still a slave to make Rome free!_At._ Was the exchange refus'd?conduct Hamilcar and myself
 To that abode thou hast for each provided.And will my father spurn his household gods?_Pub._ My sire a stranger?----Will he taste no more
 The smiling blessings of his cheerful home?_Reg._ Dost thou not know the laws of Rome forbid
 A foe's ambassador within her gates?_Pub._ This rigid law does not extend to thee._Reg._ Yes; did it not alike extend to all,
 'Twere tyranny.--The law rights every man,
 But favours none._At._                Then, O my father,
 Allow thy daughter to partake thy fate!The present exigence
 Demands far other thoughts, than the soft cares,
 The fond effusions, the delightful weakness,
 The dear affections 'twixt the child and parent._At._ How is my father chang'd, from what I've known him!_Reg._ The fate of Regulus is chang'd, not Regulus.I am the same; in laurels or in chains
 'Tis the same principle; the same fix'd soul,
 Unmov'd itself, though circumstances change.The native vigour of the free-born mind
 Still struggles with, still conquers adverse fortune;
 Soars above chains, invincible though vanquish'd.[_Exeunt_ REGULUS _and_ PUBLIUS.ATTILIA, HAMILCAR _going; enter_ BARCE._Ham._                     Ah!my long-lost Barce:
 Again I lose thee; Regulus rejects
 Th' exchange of prisoners Africa proposes.My heart's too full.--Oh, I have much to say!_Barce._ Yet you unkindly leave me, and say nothing.didst thou love as thy Hamilcar loves,
 Words were superfluous; in my eyes, my Barce,
 Thou'dst read the tender eloquence of love,
 Th' uncounterfeited language of my heart.A single look betrays the soul's soft feelings,
 And shows imperfect speech of little worth._At._ My father then conspires his own destruction,
 Is it not so?_Barce._       Indeed I fear it much;
 But as the senate has not yet resolv'd,
 There is some room for hope: lose not a moment;
 And, ere the Conscript Fathers are assembled,
 Try all the powers of winning eloquence,
 Each gentle art of feminine persuasion,
 The love of kindred, and the faith of friends,
 To bend the rigid Romans to thy purpose._At._ Yes, Barce, I will go; I will exert
 My little pow'r, though hopeless of success.fall'n from hope's gay heights
 Down the dread precipice of deep despair.So some tir'd mariner the coast espies,
 And his lov'd home explores with straining eyes;
 Prepares with joy to quit the treacherous deep,
 Hush'd every wave, and every wind asleep;
 But ere he lands upon the well-known shore,
 Wild storms arise, and furious billows roar,
 Tear the fond wretch from all his hopes away,
 And drive his shatter'd bark again to sea.SCENE--_A Portico of a Palace without the gates of
 Rome--The abode of the Carthaginian Ambassador_._Enter_ REGULUS _and_ PUBLIUS _meeting_.Publius here at such a time as this?Know'st thou th' important question that the Senate
 This very hour debate?--Thy country's glory,
 Thy father's honour, and the public good?Dost thou know this and fondly linger here?_Pub._ They're not yet met, my father._Reg._                            Haste--away--
 Support my counsel in th' assembled Senate,
 Confirm their wav'ring virtue by thy courage,
 And Regulus shall glory in his boy.spare thy son the most ungrateful task.What!--supplicate the ruin of my father?_Reg._ The good of Rome can never hurt her sons._Pub._ In pity to thy children, spare thyself._Reg._ Dost thou then think that mine's a frantic bravery?That Regulus would rashly seek his fate?how little dost thou know thy sire!learn, that like _other_ men,
 I shun the _evil_, and I seek the _good_;
 But _that_ I find in _guilt_, and _this_ in _virtue_.Were it not guilt, guilt of the blackest die,
 Even to _think_ of freedom at th' expense
 Of my dear bleeding country?To me, therefore,
 Freedom and life would be the heaviest evils;
 But to preserve that country, to restore her,
 To heal her wounds though at the price of _life_,
 Or what is dearer far, the price of liberty,
 Is _virtue_--therefore slavery and death
 Are Regulus's good--his wish--his choice._Pub._ Yet sure our country----

 _Reg._                        Is a _whole_, my Publius,
 Of which we all are _parts_; nor should a citizen
 Regard his interests as distinct from hers;
 No hopes or fears should touch his patriot soul,
 But what affect her honour or her shame.E'en when in hostile fields he bleeds to save her,
 'Tis not _his_ blood he loses, 'tis his _country's_;
 He only pays her back a debt he owes.To her he's bound for birth and education:
 Her laws secure him from domestic feuds,
 And from the foreign foe her arms protect him.She lends him honours, dignity, and rank,
 His wrongs revenges, and his merit pays;
 And like a tender and indulgent mother,
 Loads him with comforts, and would make his state
 As blest as nature and the gods design'd it.Such gifts, my son, have their alloy of _pain_;
 And let th' unworthy wretch who will not bear
 His portion of the public burden lose
 Th' advantages it yields;--let him retire
 From the dear blessings of a social life,
 And from the sacred laws which guard those blessings;
 Renounce the civilis'd abodes of man,
 With kindred brutes one common shelter seek
 In horrid wilds, and dens, and dreary caves,
 And with their shaggy tenants share the spoil;
 Or if the savage hunters miss their prey,
 From scatter'd acorns pick a scanty meal;--
 Far from the sweet civilities of life;
 There let him live and vaunt his wretched freedom:
 While we, obedient to the laws that guard us,
 Guard _them_, and live or die as they decree._Pub._ With reverence and astonishment I hear thee!Thy words, my father, have convinc'd my reason,
 But cannot touch my heart:--nature denies
 Obedience so repugnant._Reg._ A poor excuse, unworthy of a Roman!Brutus, Virginius, Manlius--they were fathers._Pub._ 'Tis true, they were; but this heroic greatness,
 This glorious elevation of the soul,
 Has been confin'd to fathers.--Rome, till now,
 Boasts not a son of such unnatural virtue,
 Who, spurning all the powerful ties of blood,
 Has labour'd to procure his father's death._Reg._ Then be the first to give the great example--
 Go, hasten; be thyself that son, my Publius.ah!--

 _Reg._               Publius, no more; begone--
 Attend the Senate--let me know my fate;
 'Twill be more glorious if announc'd by thee._Pub._ Too much, too much thy rigid virtue claims
 From thy unhappy son.In either case an obvious duty waits thee:
 If thou regard'st me as an alien here,
 Learn to prefer to mine the good of Rome;
 If as a father--reverence my commands.couldst thou look into my inmost soul,
 And see how warm it burns with love and duty,
 Thou would'st abate the rigour of thy words._Reg._ Could I explore the secrets of thy breast,
 The virtue I would wish should flourish there
 Were fortitude, not weak, complaining love._Pub._ If thou requir'st my _blood_, I'll shed it all;
 But when thou dost enjoin the harsher task
 That I should labour to procure thy death,
 Forgive thy son--he has not so much virtue._Reg._ Th' important hour draws on, and now my soul
 Loses her wonted calmness, lest the Senate
 Should doubt what answer to return to Carthage.look down propitious on her,
 Inspire her Senate with your sacred wisdom,
 And call up all that's Roman in their souls!_Enter_ MANLIUS (_speaking_).See that the lictors wait, and guard the entrance--
 Take care that none intrude._Reg._                         Ah!_Man._                     Where, where is Regulus?The great, the godlike, the invincible?Oh, let me strain the hero to my breast.--

 _Reg._ (_avoiding him._)
 Manlius, stand off, remember I'm a slave!_Man._                    I am something more:
 I am a man enamour'd of thy virtues;
 Thy fortitude and courage have subdued me.I _was_ thy _rival_--I am _now_ thy _friend_;
 Allow me that distinction, dearer far
 Than all the honours Rome can give without it._Reg._ This is the temper still of noble minds,
 And these the blessings of an humble fortune.Had I not been a _slave_, I ne'er had gain'd
 The treasure of thy friendship._Man._                           I confess,
 Thy grandeur cast a veil before my eyes,
 Which thy reverse of fortune has remov'd.Oft have I seen thee on the day of triumph,
 A conqueror of nations, enter Rome;
 Now, thou hast conquer'd fortune, and thyself.Thy laurels oft have mov'd my soul to envy,
 Thy chains awaken my respect, my reverence;
 Then Regulus appear'd a hero to me,
 He rises now a god._Reg._                    Manlius, enough.Cease thy applause; 'tis dang'rous; praise like thine
 Might tempt the most severe and cautious virtue.Bless'd be the gods, who gild my latter days
 With the bright glory of the Consul's friendship!_Man._ Forbid it, Jove!said'st thou thy _latter_ days?May gracious heav'n to a far distant hour
 Protract thy valued life!Be it _my_ care
 To crown the hopes of thy admiring country,
 By giving back her long-lost hero to her.I will exert my power to bring about
 Th' exchange of captives Africa proposes._Reg._ Manlius, and is it thus, is this the way
 Thou dost begin to give me proofs of friendship?if thy love be so destructive to me,
 What would thy hatred be?Shall I then lose the profit of my wrongs?Be thus defrauded of the benefit
 I vainly hop'd from all my years of bondage?I did not come to show my chains to Rome,
 To move my country to a weak compassion;
 I came to save her _honour_, to preserve her
 From tarnishing her glory; came to snatch her
 From offers so destructive to her fame.either give me proofs more worthy
 A Roman's friendship, or renew thy hate._Man._ Dost thou not know, that this exchange refus'd,
 Inevitable death must be thy fate?_Reg._ And has the name of _death_ such terror in it,
 To strike with dread the mighty soul of Manlius?'Tis not _to-day_ I learn that I am mortal.The foe can only take from Regulus
 What wearied nature would have shortly yielded;
 It will be now a voluntary gift,
 'Twould then become a tribute seiz'd, not offer'd.Yes, Manlius, tell the world that as I liv'd
 For Rome alone, when I could live no longer,
 'Twas my last care how, dying, to assist,
 To save that country I had liv'd to serve.Hast thou then sworn, thou awfully good man,
 Never to bless the Consul with thy friendship?_Reg._ If thou wilt love me, love me like a _Roman_.These are the terms on which I take thy friendship.We both must make a sacrifice to Rome,
 I of my life, and thou of _Regulus_:
 One must resign his being, one his friend.It is but just, that what procures our country
 Such real blessings, such substantial good,
 Should cost thee something--I shall lose but little.but promise, ere thou goest,
 With all the Consular authority,
 Thou wilt support my counsel in the Senate.If thou art willing to accept these terms,
 With transport I embrace thy proffer'd friendship._Man._ (_after a pause._) Yes, I do promise._Reg._                 Bounteous gods, I thank you!Ye never gave, in all your round of blessing,
 A gift so greatly welcome to my soul,
 As Manlius' friendship on the terms of honour!_Reg._ My friend, there's not a moment to be lost;
 Ere this, perhaps, the Senate is assembled.To thee, and to thy virtues, I commit
 The dignity of Rome--my peace and honour._Reg._                       Farewell, my friend!_Man._ The sacred flame thou hast kindled in my soul
 Glows in each vein, trembles in every nerve,
 And raises me to something more than man.My blood is fir'd with virtue, and with Rome,
 And every pulse beats an alarm to glory.Who would not spurn a sceptre when compar'd
 With chains like thine?Thou man of every virtus,
 O, farewell!_Reg._ Now I begin to live; propitious heaven
 Inclines to favour me.----Licinius here?_Lic._ With joy, my honour'd friend, I seek thy presence._Lic._                   Because my heart once more
 Beats high with flattering hope.In thy great cause
 I have been labouring._Reg._                 Say'st thou in _my_ cause?_Lic._ In thine and Rome's.Couldst thou, then, think so poorly of Licinius,
 That base ingratitude could find a place
 Within his bosom?--Can I, then, forget
 Thy thousand acts of friendship to my youth?Forget them, too, at that important moment
 When most I might assist thee?--Regulus,
 Thou wast my leader, general, father--all.Didst thou not teach me early how to tread
 The path of glory; point the way thyself,
 And bid me follow thee?_Reg._                    But say, Licinius,
 What hast thou done to serve me?_Lic._                             I have defended
 Thy liberty and life!_Reg._                 Ah!speak--explain.--

 _Lic._ Just as the Fathers were about to meet,
 I hasten'd to the temple--at the entrance
 Their passage I retarded by the force
 Of strong entreaty: then address'd myself
 So well to each, that I from each obtain'd
 A declaration, that his utmost power
 Should be exerted for thy life and freedom._Lic._ Not he alone; no, 'twere indeed unjust
 To rob the fair Attilia of her claim
 To filial merit.--What I could, I did.But _she_--thy charming daughter--heav'n and earth,
 What did she not to save her father?_Reg._                                  Who?_Lic._ Attilia, thy belov'd--thy age's darling!Was ever father bless'd with such a child?how her looks took captive all who saw her!How did her soothing eloquence subdue
 The stoutest hearts of Rome!How did she rouse
 Contending passions in the breasts of all!With what a soft, inimitable grace
 She prais'd, reproach'd, entreated, flatter'd, sooth'd._Lic._                        What could they say?See where she comes--Hope dances in her eyes,
 And lights up all her beauties into smiles._At._ Once more, my dearest father----

 _Reg._                         Ah, presume not
 To call me by that name.For know, Attilia,
 I number _thee_ among the foes of Regulus._Reg._ His worst of foes--the murd'rer of his glory.is it then a proof of enmity
 To wish thee all the good the gods can give thee,
 To yield my life, if needful, for thy service?_Reg._ Thou rash, imprudent girl!thou little know'st
 The dignity and weight of public cares.Who made a weak and inexperienc'd _woman_
 The arbiter of Regulus's fate?_Lic._ For pity's sake, my Lord!_Reg._                      Peace, peace, young man!_That_ bears at least the semblance of repentance.Immortal Powers!----a daughter and a Roman!_At._ Because I _am_ a daughter, I presum'd----

 _Lic._ Because I _am_ a Roman, I aspired
 T' oppose th' inhuman rigour of thy fate._Reg._ No more, Licinius.How can he be call'd
 A Roman who would live in infamy?Or how can she be Regulus's daughter
 Whose coward mind wants fortitude and honour?now you make me _feel_
 The burden of my chains: your feeble souls
 Have made me know I am indeed a slave._At._ Tell me, Licinius, and, oh!tell me truly,
 If thou believ'st, in all the round of time,
 There ever breath'd a maid so truly wretched?To weep, to mourn a father's cruel fate--
 To love him with soul-rending tenderness--
 To know no peace by day or rest by night--
 To bear a bleeding heart in this poor bosom,
 Which aches, and trembles but to think he suffers:
 This is my crime--in any other child
 'Twould be a merit._Lic._                Oh!my best Attilia,
 Do not repent thee of the pious deed:
 It was a virtuous error._That_ in _us_
 Is a just duty, which the god-like soul
 Of Regulus would think a shameful weakness.If the contempt of life in him be virtue,
 It were in us a crime to let him perish.Perhaps at last he may consent to live:
 He then will thank us for our cares to save him:
 Let not his anger fright thee.Though our love
 Offend him now, yet, when his mighty soul
 Is reconcil'd to life, he will not chide us.The sick man loathes, and with reluctance takes
 The remedy by which his health's restor'd._Lic._ Would my Attilia rather lose her father
 Than, by offending him, preserve his life?If he but live, I am contented._Lic._ Yes, he shall live, and we again be bless'd;
 Then dry thy tears, and let those lovely orbs
 Beam with their wonted lustre on Licinius,
 Who lives but in the sunshine of thy smiles.O Fortune, Fortune, thou capricious goddess!Thy frowns and favours have alike no bounds:
 Unjust, or prodigal in each extreme.When thou wouldst humble human vanity,
 By singling out a wretch to bear thy wrath,
 Thou crushest him with anguish to excess:
 If thou wouldst bless, thou mak'st the happiness
 Too poignant for his giddy sense to bear.----
 Immortal gods, who rule the fates of men,
 Preserve my father!bless him, bless him, heav'n!If your avenging thunderbolts _must_ fall,
 Strike _here_--this bosom will invite the blow,
 And _thank_ you for it: but in mercy spare,
 Oh!spare _his_ sacred, venerable head:
 Respect in _him_ an image of yourselves;
 And leave a world, who wants it, an example
 Of courage, wisdom, constancy and truth.Yet if, Eternal Powers who rule this ball!You have decreed that Regulus must fall;
 Teach me to yield to your divine command,
 And meekly bow to your correcting hand;
 Contented to resign, or pleas'd receive,
 What wisdom may withhold, or mercy give.SCENE--_A Gallery in the Ambassador's Palace._


 _Reg._ (_alone._)
 Be calm, my soul!Thou hast defied the dangers of the deep,
 Th' impetuous hurricane, the thunder's roar,
 And all the terrors of the various war;
 Yet, now thou tremblest, now thou stand'st dismay'd,
 With fearful expectation of thy fate.----
 Yes--thou hast amplest reason for thy fears;
 For till this hour, so pregnant with events,
 Thy fame and glory never were at stake.Soft--let me think--what is this thing call'd _glory_?'Tis the soul's tyrant, that should be dethron'd,
 And learn subjection like her other passions!'tis false: this is the coward's plea;
 The lazy language of refining vice.That man was born in vain, whose wish to serve
 Is circumscrib'd within the wretched bounds
 Of _self_--a narrow, miserable sphere!Glory exalts, enlarges, dignifies,
 Absorbs the selfish in the social claims,
 And renders man a blessing to mankind.--
 It is this principle, this spark of deity,
 Rescues debas'd humanity from guilt,
 And elevates it by her strong excitements:--
 It takes off sensibility from pain,
 From peril fear, plucks out the sting from death,
 Changes ferocious into gentle manners,
 And teaches men to imitate the gods.he advances with a down-cast eye,
 And step irresolute----

    _Enter_ PUBLIUS._Reg._                My Publius, welcome!quickly tell me.--

 _Pub._ I cannot speak, and yet, alas!_Reg._ Tell me the whole.--

 _Pub._                Would I were rather dumb!_Reg._ Publius, no more delay:--I charge thee speak._Pub._ The Senate has decreed thou shalt depart.thou hast at last prevail'd--
 I thank the gods, I have not liv'd in vain!Where is Hamilcar?--find him--let us go,
 For Regulus has nought to do in Rome;
 I have accomplished her important work,
 And must depart._Pub._            Ah, my unhappy father!_Reg._ Unhappy, Publius!Does he, does that bless'd man deserve this name,
 Who to his latest breath can serve his country?_Pub._ Like thee, my father, I adore my country,
 Yet weep with anguish o'er thy cruel chains._Reg._ Dost thou not know that _life_'s a slavery?The body is the chain that binds the soul;
 A yoke that every mortal must endure.Wouldst thou lament--lament the general fate,
 The chain that nature gives, entail'd on all,
 Not these _I_ wear?_Pub._              Forgive, forgive my sorrows:
 I know, alas!too well, those fell barbarians
 Intend thee instant death._Reg._                   So shall my life
 And servitude together have an end.----
 Publius, farewell; nay, do not follow me.--

 _Pub._ Alas!my father, if thou ever lov'dst me,
 Refuse me not the mournful consolation
 To pay the last sad offices of duty
 I e'er can show thee.----

 _Reg._                  No!--thou canst fulfil
 Thy duty to thy father in a way
 More grateful to him: I must strait embark.Be it meanwhile thy pious care to keep
 My lov'd Attilia from a sight, I fear,
 Would rend her gentle heart.--Her tears, my son,
 Would dim the glories of thy father's triumph.And should her sorrows pass the bounds of reason,
 Publius, have pity on her tender age,
 Compassionate the weakness of her sex;
 We must not hope to find in _her_ soft soul
 The strong exertion of a manly courage.----
 Support her fainting spirit, and instruct her,
 By thy example, how a Roman ought
 To bear misfortune.And be to her the father she will lose.I leave my daughter to thee--I do more----
 I leave to thee the conduct of--thyself.I perceive thy courage fails--
 I see the quivering lip, the starting tear:--
 That lip, that tear calls down my mounting soul.Resume thyself--Oh, do not blast my hope!Yes--I'm compos'd--thou wilt not mock my age--
 Thou _art_--thou art a _Roman_--and my son._Pub._ And is he gone?--now be thyself, my soul--
 Hard is the conflict, but the triumph glorious.Yes.--I must conquer these too tender feelings;
 The blood that fills these veins demands it of me;
 My father's great example too requires it.Forgive me _Rome_, and _glory_, if I yielded
 To nature's strong attack:--I must subdue it.Now, Regulus, I _feel_ I am thy _son_._Enter_ ATTILIA _and_ BARCE._At._ My brother, I'm distracted, wild with fear--
 Tell me, O tell me, what I dread to know--
 Is it then true?--I cannot speak--my father?_Barce._ May we believe the fatal news?_Pub._                                Yes, Barce,
 It is determin'd._At._ Immortal Powers!--What say'st thou?_Barce._                               Can it be?_At._                  Then you've all betray'd me._Enter_ HAMILCAR _and_ LICINIUS._Barce._                         Pity us, Hamilcar!_At._ Oh, help, Licinius, help the lost Attilia!_Lic._                     Ah!my fair mourner,
 All's lost._At._          What all, Licinius?Tell me, at least, where Regulus is gone:
 The daughter shall partake the father's chains,
 And share the woes she knew not to prevent.[_Going._

 _Pub._ What would thy wild despair?Attilia, stay,
 Thou must not follow; this excess of grief
 Would much offend him._At._                    Dost thou hope to stop me?_Pub._ I hope thou wilt resume thy better self,
 And recollect thy father will not bear----

 _At._ I only recollect I am a _daughter_,
 A poor, defenceless, helpless, wretched daughter!_Pub._                         No, my sister._At._ Detain me not--Ah!while thou hold'st me here,
 He goes, and I shall never see him more._Barce._ My friend, be comforted, he cannot go
 Whilst here Hamilcar stays._At._                          O Barce, Barce!Who will advise, who comfort, who assist me?Hamilcar, pity me.--Thou wilt not answer?_Ham._ Rage and astonishment divide my soul._At._ Licinius, wilt thou not relieve my sorrows?_Lic._ Yes, at my life's expense, my heart's best treasure,
 Wouldst thou instruct me how._At._                         My brother, too----
 Ah!_Pub._ I will at least instruct thee how to _bear_ them.My sister--yield thee to thy adverse fate;
 Think of thy father, think of Regulus;
 Has he not taught thee how to brave misfortune?'Tis but by following his illustrious steps
 Thou e'er canst merit to be call'd his daughter._At._ And is it thus thou dost advise thy sister?Are these, ye gods, the feelings of a son?Indifference here becomes impiety--
 Thy savage heart ne'er felt the dear delights
 Of filial tenderness--the thousand joys
 That flow from blessing and from being bless'd!No--didst thou love thy father as _I_ love him,
 Our kindred souls would be in unison;
 And all my sighs be echoed back by thine.Thou wouldst--alas!--I know not what I say.--
 Forgive me, Publius,--but indeed, my brother,
 I do not understand this cruel coldness._Ham._ Thou may'st not--but I understand it well.His mighty soul, full as to thee it seems
 Of Rome, and glory--is enamour'd--caught--
 Enraptur'd with the beauties of fair Barce.--
 _She_ stays behind if Regulus _departs_.Behold the cause of all the well-feign'd virtue
 Of this mock patriot--curst dissimulation!_Pub._ And canst thou entertain such vile suspicions?now I see thee as thou art,
 Thy naked soul divested of its veil,
 Its specious colouring, its dissembled virtues:
 Thou hast plotted with the Senate to prevent
 Th' exchange of captives.All thy subtle arts,
 Thy smooth inventions, have been set to work--
 The base refinements of your _polish'd_ land._Pub._ In truth the doubt is worthy of an African.[_Contemptuously._

 _Ham._ I know.----

 _Pub._ Peace, Carthaginian, peace, and hear me,
 Dost thou not know, that on the very man
 Thou hast insulted, Barce's fate depends?_Ham._ Too well I know, the cruel chance of war
 Gave her, a blooming captive, to thy mother;
 Who, dying, left the beauteous prize to thee._Pub._ Now, see the use a _Roman_ makes of power.Heav'n is my witness how I lov'd the maid!Oh, she was dearer to my soul than light!Dear as the vital stream that feeds my heart!But know my _honour_'s dearer than my love.I do not even hope _thou_ wilt believe me;
 _Thy_ brutal soul, as savage as thy clime,
 Can never taste those elegant delights,
 Those pure refinements, love and glory yield.'Tis not to thee I stoop for vindication,
 Alike to me thy friendship or thy hate;
 But to remove from others a pretence
 For branding Publius with the name of villain;
 That _they_ may see no sentiment but honour
 Informs this bosom--Barce, thou art _free_.Thou hast my leave with him to quit this shore.Now learn, barbarian, how a _Roman_ loves![_Exit._

 _Barce._ He cannot mean it!_Ham._                         Oh, exalted virtue!cruel Publius, wilt thou leave me thus?_Barce._                Didst thou hear, Hamilcar?Oh, didst thou hear the god-like youth resign me?[HAMILCAR _and_ LICINIUS _seem lost in thought_._Ham._ Farewell, I will return._Barce._ Hamilcar, where----

 _At._                 Alas!_Lic._ If possible, to save the life of Regulus._At._ But by what means?--Ah!_Lic._ Since the disease so desperate is become,
 We must apply a desperate remedy._Ham._ (_after a long pause._)
 Yes--I will mortify this generous foe;
 I'll be reveng'd upon this stubborn Roman;
 Not by defiance bold, or feats of arms,
 But by a means more sure to work its end;
 By emulating his exalted worth,
 And showing him a virtue like his own;
 Such a refin'd revenge as noble minds
 Alone can practise, and alone can feel._At._ If thou wilt go, Licinius, let Attilia
 At least go with thee._Lic._                 No, my gentle love,
 Too much I prize thy safety and thy peace.Let me entreat thee, stay with Barce here
 Till our return._At._              Then, ere ye go, in pity
 Explain the latent purpose of your souls._Lic._ Soon shalt thou know it all--Farewell!Let us keep Regulus in _Rome_, or _die_.[_To_ HAMILCAR _as he goes out_._Ham._ Yes.--These smooth, polish'd Romans shall confess
 The soil of _Afric_, too, produces heroes.What, though our pride, perhaps, be less than theirs,
 Our virtue may be equal: they shall own
 The path of honour's not unknown to Carthage,
 Nor, as they arrogantly think, confin'd
 To their proud Capitol:----Yes--they shall learn
 The gods look down on other climes than theirs.[_Exit._

 _At._ What gone, _both_ gone?Licinius leaves me, led by love and virtue,
 To rouse the citizens to war and tumult,
 Which may be fatal to himself and Rome,
 And yet, alas!_Barce._ Nor is thy Barce more at ease, my friend;
 I dread the fierceness of Hamilcar's courage:
 Rous'd by the grandeur of thy brother's deed,
 And stung by his reproaches, his great soul
 Will scorn to be outdone by him in glory.Yet, let us rise to courage and to life,
 Forget the weakness of our helpless sex,
 And mount above these coward woman's fears.Hope dawns upon my mind--my prospect clears,
 And every cloud now brightens into day.Thy sanguine temper,
 Flush'd with the native vigour of thy soil,
 Supports thy spirits; while the sad Attilia,
 Sinking with more than all her sex's fears,
 Sees not a beam of hope; or, if she sees it,
 'Tis not the bright, warm splendour of the sun;
 It is a sickly and uncertain glimmer
 Of instantaneous lightning passing by.It shows, but not diminishes, the danger,
 And leaves my poor benighted soul as dark
 As it had never shone._Barce._                 Come, let us go.Yes, joys unlook'd-for now shall gild thy days,
 And brighter suns reflect propitious rays.[_Exeunt._


 SCENE--_A Hall looking towards the Garden._

 _Enter_ REGULUS, _speaking to one of_ HAMILCAR'S _Attendants_.Ere this he doubtless knows the Senate's will.Go, seek him out--Tell him we must depart----
 Rome has no hope for him, or wish for me.O let me strain thee to this grateful heart,
 And thank thee for the vast, vast debt I owe thee!But for _thy_ friendship I had been a wretch----
 Had been compell'd to shameful _liberty_.To thee I owe the glory of these chains,
 My faith inviolate, my fame preserv'd,
 My honour, virtue, glory, bondage,--all!_Man._ But we shall lose thee, so it is decreed----
 Thou must depart?_Reg._                Because I must depart
 You will not lose me; I were lost, indeed,
 Did I remain in Rome._Man._                   Ah!Regulus,
 Why, why so late do I begin to love thee?why have the adverse fates decreed
 I ne'er must give thee other proofs of friendship,
 Than those so fatal and so full of woe?_Reg._ Thou hast perform'd the duties of a friend;
 Of a just, faithful, Roman, noble friend:
 Yet, generous as thou art, if thou constrain me
 To sink beneath a weight of obligation,
 I could--yes, Manlius--I could ask still more._Reg._                   I think I have fulfill'd
 The various duties of a citizen;
 Nor have I aught beside to do for Rome.Manlius, I recollect I am a father!my friend,
 They are--(forgive the weakness of a parent)
 To my fond heart dear as the drops that warm it.Next to my country they're my all of life;
 And, if a weak old man be not deceiv'd,
 They will not shame that country.Yes, my friend,
 The love of virtue blazes in their souls.As yet these tender plants are immature,
 And ask the fostering hand of cultivation:
 Heav'n, in its wisdom, would not let their _father_
 Accomplish this great work.--To thee, my friend,
 The tender parent delegates the trust:
 Do not refuse a poor man's legacy;
 I do bequeath my orphans to thy love--
 If thou wilt kindly take them to thy bosom,
 Their loss will be repaid with usury.Oh, let the father owe his glory to thee,
 The children their protection!_Man._                           Regulus,
 With grateful joy my heart accepts the trust:
 Oh, I will shield, with jealous tenderness,
 The precious blossoms from a blasting world.In me thy children shall possess a father,
 Though not as worthy, yet as fond as thee.The pride be mine to fill their youthful breasts
 With ev'ry virtue--'twill not cost me much:
 I shall have nought to teach, nor they to learn,
 But the great history of their god-like sire._Reg._ I will not hurt the grandeur of thy virtue,
 By paying thee so poor a thing as thanks.Now all is over, and I bless the gods,
 I've nothing more to do._Enter_ PUBLIUS _in haste_._Pub._                    O Regulus!_Pub._                       Rome is in a tumult--
 There's scarce a citizen but runs to arms--
 They will not let thee go._Reg._                     Is't possible?Can Rome so far forget her dignity
 As to desire this infamous exchange?_Pub._               Ah!Rome cares not for the peace, nor for th' exchange;
 She only wills that Regulus shall stay._Pub._              No: every man exclaims
 That neither faith nor honour should be kept
 With Carthaginian perfidy and fraud.Can guilt in Carthage palliate guilt in Rome,
 Or vice in one absolve it in another?who hereafter shall be criminal,
 If precedents are us'd to justify
 The blackest crimes._Pub._                 Th' infatuated people
 Have called the augurs to the sacred fane,
 There to determine this momentous point._Reg._ I have no need of _oracles_, my son;
 _Honour's_ the oracle of honest men.I gave my promise, which I will observe
 With most religious strictness.Rome, 'tis true,
 Had power to choose the peace, or change of slaves;
 But whether Regulus return, or not,
 Is _his_ concern, not the concern of _Rome_._That_ was a public, _this_ a private care.thy father is not what he was;
 _I_ am the slave of _Carthage_, nor has Rome
 Power to dispose of captives not her own.let us to the port.--Farewell, my friend._Man._ Let me entreat thee stay; for shouldst thou go
 To stem this tumult of the populace,
 They will by force detain thee: then, alas!Both Regulus and Rome must break their faith._Man._                                No, Regulus,
 I will not check thy great career of glory:
 Thou shalt depart; meanwhile, I'll try to calm
 This wild tumultuous uproar of the people._Reg._ Thy virtue is my safeguard----but----

 _Man._                                Enough----
 _I_ know _thy_ honour, and trust thou to _mine_.I am a _Roman_, and I feel some sparks
 Of Regulus's virtue in my breast.Though fate denies me thy illustrious chains,
 I will at least endeavour to _deserve_ them.[_Exit._

 _Reg._ How is my country alter'd!how, alas,
 Is the great spirit of old Rome extinct!_Restraint_ and _force_ must now be put to use
 To _make_ her virtuous.She must be _compell'd_
 To faith and honour.--Ah!And dost thou leave so tamely to my friend
 The honour to assist me?Go, my boy,
 'Twill make me _more_ in love with chains and death,
 To owe them to a _son_._Pub._                    I go, my father--
 I will, I will obey thee._Reg._                    Do not sigh----
 One sigh will check the progress of thy glory._Pub._ Yes, I will own the pangs of death itself
 Would be less cruel than these agonies:
 Yet do not frown austerely on thy son:
 His anguish is his virtue: if to conquer
 The feelings of my soul were easy to me,
 'Twould be no merit.Do not then defraud
 The sacrifice I make thee of its worth.[_Exeunt severally._


    MANLIUS, ATTILIA._At._ (_speaking as she enters._)
 Where is the Consul?--Where, oh, where is Manlius?I come to breathe the voice of mourning to him,
 I come to crave his mercy, to conjure him
 To whisper peace to my afflicted bosom,
 And heal the anguish of a wounded spirit._Man._ What would the daughter of my noble friend?_At._ (_kneeling._)
 If ever pity's sweet emotions touch'd thee,--
 If ever gentle love assail'd thy breast,--
 If ever virtuous friendship fir'd thy soul--
 By the dear names of husband and of parent--
 By all the soft, yet powerful ties of nature--
 If e'er thy lisping infants charm'd thine ear,
 And waken'd all the father in thy soul,--
 If e'er thou hop'st to have thy latter days
 Blest by their love, and sweeten'd by their duty--
 Oh, hear a kneeling, weeping, wretched daughter,
 Who begs a father's life!--nor hers alone,
 But Rome's--his country's father._Man._                                Gentle maid!Oh, spare this soft, subduing eloquence!--
 Nay, rise.I shall forget I am a Roman--
 Forget the mighty debt I owe my country--
 Forget the fame and glory of thy father.[_Turns from her._

 _At._ (_rises eagerly._)            Ah!Indulge, indulge, my Lord, the virtuous softness:
 Was ever sight so graceful, so becoming,
 As pity's tear upon the hero's cheek?_Man._ No more--I must not hear thee.[_Going._

 _At._                    How!You must--you shall--nay, nay return, my Lord--
 Oh, fly not from me!----look upon my woes,
 And imitate the mercy of the gods:
 'Tis not their thunder that excites our reverence,
 'Tis their mild mercy, and forgiving love.'Twill add a brighter lustre to thy laurels,
 When men shall say, and proudly point thee out,
 "Behold the Consul!--He who sav'd his friend."Oh, what a tide of joy will overwhelm thee!_Man._ Thy father scorns his liberty and life,
 Nor will accept of either at the expense
 Of honour, virtue, glory, faith, and Rome._At._ Think you behold the god-like Regulus
 The prey of unrelenting savage foes,
 Ingenious only in contriving ill:----
 Eager to glut their hunger of revenge,
 They'll plot such new, such dire, unheard-of tortures--
 Such dreadful, and such complicated vengeance,
 As e'en the Punic annals have not known;
 And, as they heap fresh torments on his head,
 They'll glory in their genius for destruction.Manlius--now methinks I see my father--
 My faithful fancy, full of his idea,
 Presents him to me--mangled, gash'd, and torn--
 Stretch'd on the rack in writhing agony--
 The torturing pincers tear his quivering flesh,
 While the dire murderers smile upon his wounds,
 His groans their music, and his pangs their sport.And if they lend some interval of ease,
 Some dear-bought intermission, meant to make
 The following pang more exquisitely felt,
 Th' insulting executioners exclaim,
 --"Now, Roman!_Man._ Repress thy sorrows----

 _At._                     Can the friend of Regulus
 Advise his daughter not to mourn his fate?is friendship when compar'd
 To ties of blood--to nature's powerful impulse!Yes--she asserts her empire in my soul,
 'Tis Nature pleads--she will--she must be heard;
 With warm, resistless eloquence she pleads.--
 Ah, thou art soften'd!--see--the Consul yields--
 The feelings triumph--tenderness prevails--
 The Roman is subdued--the daughter conquers![_Catching hold of his robe._

 _Man._ Ah, hold me not!--I must not, cannot stay,
 The softness of thy sorrow is contagious;
 I, too, may feel when I should only reason.I dare not hear thee--Regulus and Rome,
 The patriot and the friend--all, all forbid it.[_Breaks from her, and exit._

 _At._ O feeble grasp!--and is he gone, quite gone?Hold, hold thy empire, Reason, firmly hold it,
 Or rather quit at once thy feeble throne,
 Since thou but serv'st to show me what I've lost,
 To heighten all the horrors that await me;
 To summon up a wild distracted crowd
 Of fatal images, to shake my soul,
 To scare sweet peace, and banish hope itself.thou pale-ey'd spectre, come,
 For thou shalt be Attilia's inmate now,
 And thou shalt grow, and twine about her heart,
 And she shall be so much enamour'd of thee,
 The pageant Pleasure ne'er shall interpose
 Her gaudy presence to divide you more.[_Stands in an attitude of silent grief._


    _Enter_ LICINIUS._Lic._ At length I've found thee--ah, my charming maid!How have I sought thee out with anxious fondness!she hears me not.----My best Attilia!Still, still she hears not----'tis Licinius speaks,
 He comes to soothe the anguish of thy spirit,
 And hush thy tender sorrows into peace._At._ Who's he that dares assume the voice of love,
 And comes unbidden to these dreary haunts?Steals on the sacred treasury of woe,
 And breaks the league Despair and I have made?_Lic._ 'Tis one who comes the messenger of heav'n,
 To talk of peace, of comfort, and of joy._At._ Didst thou not mock me with the sound of joy?Thou little know'st the anguish of my soul,
 If thou believ'st I ever can again,
 So long the wretched sport of angry Fortune,
 Admit delusive hope to my sad bosom.No----I abjure the flatterer and her train.Let those, who ne'er have been like me deceiv'd,
 Embrace the fair fantastic sycophant--
 For I, alas!am wedded to despair,
 And will not hear the sound of comfort more._Lic._ Cease, cease, my love, this tender voice of woe,
 Though softer than the dying cygnet's plaint:
 She ever chants her most melodious strain
 When death and sorrow harmonise her note._At._ Yes--I will listen now with fond delight;
 For death and sorrow are my darling themes.Well!--what hast thou to say of death and sorrow?Believe me, thou wilt find me apt to listen,
 And, if my tongue be slow to answer thee,
 Instead of words I'll give thee sighs and tears._Lic._ I come to dry thy tears, not make them flow;
 The gods once more propitious smile upon us,
 Joy shall again await each happy morn,
 And ever-new delight shall crown the day!Yes, Regulus shall live.----

 _At._                   Ah me!I'm but a poor, weak, trembling woman--
 I cannot bear these wild extremes of fate--
 Then mock me not.--I think thou art Licinius,
 The generous lover, and the faithful friend!I think thou wouldst not sport with my afflictions._Lic._ Mock thy afflictions?--May eternal Jove,
 And every power at whose dread shrine we worship,
 Blast all the hopes my fond ideas form,
 If I deceive thee!Regulus shall live,
 Shall live to give thee to Licinius' arms.we will smooth his downward path of life,
 And after a long length of virtuous years,
 At the last verge of honourable age,
 When nature's glimmering lamp goes gently out,
 We'll close, together close his eyes in peace--
 Together drop the sweetly-painful tear--
 Then copy out his virtues in our lives._At._ And shall we be so blest?Forgive me, my Licinius, if I doubt thee.Fate never gave such exquisite delight
 As flattering hope hath imag'd to thy soul.But how?----Explain this bounty of the gods._Lic._ Thou know'st what influence the name of Tribune
 Gives its possessor o'er the people's minds:
 That power I have exerted, nor in vain;
 All are prepar'd to second my designs:
 The plot is ripe,--there's not a man but swears
 To keep thy god-like father here in Rome----
 To save his life at hazard of his own._At._ By what gradation does my joy ascend!I thought that if my father had been sav'd
 By any means, I had been rich in bliss:
 But that he lives, and lives preserv'd by thee,
 Is such a prodigality of fate,
 I cannot bear my joy with moderation:
 Heav'n should have dealt it with a scantier hand,
 And not have shower'd such plenteous blessings on me;
 They are too great, too flattering to be real;
 'Tis some delightful vision, which enchants,
 And cheats my senses, weaken'd by misfortune._Lic._ We'll seek thy father, and meanwhile, my fair,
 Compose thy sweet emotions ere thou see'st him,
 Pleasure itself is painful in excess;
 For joys, like sorrows, in extreme, oppress:
 The gods themselves our pious cares approve,
 And to reward our virtue crown our love._An Apartment in the Ambassador's Palace--Guards
 and other Attendants seen at a distance._


 _Ham._ Where is this wondrous man, this matchless hero,
 This arbiter of kingdoms and of kings,
 This delegate of heav'n, this Roman god?I long to show his soaring mind an equal,
 And bring it to the standard of humanity.What pride, what glory will it be to fix
 An obligation on his stubborn soul!The very thought exalts me e'en to rapture._Enter_ REGULUS _and Guards_._Ham._ Well, Regulus!--At last--

 _Reg._                            I know it all;
 I know the motive of thy just complaint--
 Be not alarm'd at this licentious uproar
 Of the mad populace.I will depart--
 Fear not--I will not stay in Rome alive._Ham._ What dost thou mean by uproar and alarms?Hamilcar does not come to vent complaints;
 He rather comes to prove that Afric, too,
 Produces heroes, and that Tiber's banks
 May find a rival on the Punic coast._Reg._ Be it so.--'Tis not a time for vain debate:
 Collect thy people.--Let us strait depart._Ham._ Lend me thy hearing, first._Reg._                       O patience, patience!_Ham._ Is it esteem'd a glory to be grateful?_Reg._ The time has been when 'twas a duty only,
 But 'tis a duty now so little practis'd,
 That to perform it is become a glory._Ham._ If to fulfil it should expose to danger?----

 _Reg._ It rises then to an illustrious virtue._Ham._ Then grant this merit to an African.Give me a patient hearing----Thy great son,
 As delicate in honour as in love,
 Hath nobly given my Barce to my arms;
 And yet I know he doats upon the maid.I come to emulate the generous deed;
 He gave me back my love, and in return
 I will restore his father._Reg._                   Ah!_Ham._                       I will._Reg._                                But how?_Ham._ By leaving thee at liberty to _fly_._Reg._                                      Ah!_Ham._ I will dismiss my guards on some pretence,
 Meanwhile do thou escape, and lie conceal'd:
 I will affect a rage I shall not feel,
 Unmoor my ships, and sail for Africa._Reg._ Abhorr'd barbarian!_Ham._                   Well, what dost thou say?_Reg._                       I am, indeed._Ham._ Thou could'st not then have hop'd it?_Reg._                          No!_Ham._ And yet I'm not a Roman._Reg._ (_smiling contemptuously._) I perceive it._Ham._ You may retire (_aloud to the guards_)._Reg._             No!--Stay, I charge you stay._Reg._                  I thank thee for thy offer,
 But I shall go with thee._Ham._                   'Tis well, proud man!Daniel moved to the garden._Reg._                        No--but I pity thee._Reg._                   Because thy poor dark soul
 Hath never felt the piercing ray of virtue.the scheme thou dost propose
 Would injure me, thy country, and thyself._Reg._                   Who was it gave thee power
 To rule the destiny of Regulus?Am I a slave to Carthage, or to thee?_Ham._ What does it signify from whom, proud Roman!_Reg._                           A benefit?is it a benefit
 To lie, elope, deceive, and be a villain?not when life itself, when all's at stake?Know'st thou my countrymen prepare thee tortures
 That shock imagination but to think of?Thou wilt be mangled, butcher'd, rack'd, impal'd._Reg._ (_smiling at his threats._) Hamilcar!Dost thou not know the Roman genius better?We live on honour--'tis our food, our life.The motive, and the measure of our deeds!We look on death as on a common object;
 The tongue nor faulters, nor the cheek turns pale,
 Nor the calm eye is mov'd at sight of him:
 We court, and we embrace him undismay'd;
 We smile at tortures if they lead to glory,
 And only cowardice and guilt appal us.the valour of the tongue,
 The heart disclaims it; leave this pomp of words,
 And cease dissembling with a friend like me.I know that life is dear to all who live,
 That death is dreadful,--yes, and must be fear'd,
 E'en by the frozen apathists of Rome._Reg._ Did I fear death when on Bagrada's banks
 I fac'd and slew the formidable serpent
 That made your boldest Africans recoil,
 And shrink with horror, though the monster liv'd
 A native inmate of their own parch'd deserts?Did I fear death before the gates of Adis?--
 Ask Bostar, or let Asdrubal confess._Ham._ Or shall I rather of Xantippus ask,
 Who dar'd to undeceive deluded Rome,
 And prove this vaunter not invincible?'Tis even said, in Africa I mean,
 He made a prisoner of this demigod.--
 Did we not triumph then?_Reg._                     Vain boaster!No Carthaginian conquer'd Regulus;
 Xantippus was a Greek--a brave one too:
 Yet what distinction did your Afric make
 Between the man who serv'd her, and her foe:
 I was the object of her open hate;
 He, of her secret, dark malignity.He durst not trust the nation he had sav'd;
 He knew, and therefore fear'd you.--Yes, he knew
 Where once you were oblig'd you ne'er forgave.Could you forgive at all, you'd rather pardon
 The man who hated, than the man who serv'd you.Xantippus found his ruin ere it reach'd him,
 Lurking behind your honours and rewards;
 Found it in your feign'd courtesies and fawnings.When vice intends to strike a master stroke,
 Its veil is smiles, its language protestations.The Spartan's merit threaten'd, but his service
 Compell'd his ruin.--Both you could not pardon._Ham._ Come, come, I know full well----

 _Reg._                          Barbarian!I've heard too much.--Go, call thy followers:
 Prepare thy ships, and learn to do thy duty._Ham._ Yes!--show thyself intrepid, and insult me;
 Call mine the blindness of barbarian friendship.On Tiber's banks I hear thee, and am calm:
 But know, thou scornful Roman!that too soon
 In Carthage thou may'st fear and feel my vengeance:
 Thy cold, obdurate pride shall there confess,
 Though Rome may talk--'tis Africa can punish.[_Exit._

 _Reg._ Farewell!I've not a thought to waste on thee.I fear--but see Attilia comes!--

    _Enter_ ATTILIA._Reg._ What brings thee here, my child?_At._              I cannot speak--my father!Joy chokes my utterance--Rome, dear grateful Rome,
 (Oh, may her cup with blessings overflow!)Gives up our common destiny to thee;
 Faithful and constant to th' advice thou gav'st her,
 She will not hear of peace, or change of slaves,
 But she insists--reward and bless her, gods!--
 That thou shalt here remain._Reg._                   What!with the shame----

 _At._ Oh!no--the sacred senate hath consider'd
 That when to Carthage thou did'st pledge thy faith,
 Thou wast a captive, and that being such,
 Thou could'st not bind thyself in covenant._Reg._ He who can die, is always free, my child!Learn farther, he who owns another's strength
 Confesses his own weakness.--Let them know,
 I swore I would return because I chose it,
 And will return, because I swore to do it._Pub._ Vain is that hope, my father._Reg._                          Who shall stop me?_Pub._ All Rome.----The citizens are up in arms:
 In vain would reason stop the growing torrent;
 In vain wouldst thou attempt to reach the port,
 The way is barr'd by thronging multitudes:
 The other streets of Rome are all deserted._Reg._ Where, where is Manlius?_Pub._                       He is still thy friend:
 His single voice opposes a whole people;
 He threats this moment and the next entreats,
 But all in vain; none hear him, none obey.The general fury rises e'en to madness.The axes tremble in the lictors' hands,
 Who, pale and spiritless, want power to use them--
 And one wild scene of anarchy prevails.I tremble----
                              [_Detaining_ REGULUS._Reg._                        To assist my friend--
 T' upbraid my hapless country with her crime--
 To keep unstain'd the glory of these chains--
 To go, or perish._At._               Oh!_Reg._                                 Hold;
 I have been patient with thee; have indulg'd
 Too much the fond affections of thy soul;
 It is enough; thy grief would now offend
 Thy father's honour; do not let thy tears
 Conspire with Rome to rob me of my triumph._Reg._                             I know it does.I know 'twill grieve thy gentle heart to lose me;
 But think, thou mak'st the sacrifice to Rome,
 And all is well again._At._                   Alas!my father,
 In aught beside----

 _Reg._ What wouldst thou do, my child?Canst thou direct the destiny of Rome,
 And boldly plead amid the assembled senate?Canst thou, forgetting all thy sex's softness,
 Fiercely engage in hardy deeds of arms?Canst thou encounter labour, toil and famine,
 Fatigue and hardships, watchings, cold and heat?Canst thou attempt to serve thy country thus?Thou canst not:--but thou may'st sustain my loss
 Without these agonising pains of grief,
 And set a bright example of submission,
 Worthy a Roman's daughter._At._                         Yet such fortitude--

 _Reg._ Is a most painful virtue;--but Attilia
 Is Regulus's daughter, and must have it._At._ I will entreat the gods to give it me._Reg._ Is this concern a mark that thou hast lost it?I cannot, cannot spurn my weeping child.Receive this proof of my paternal fondness;--
 Thou lov'st Licinius--he too loves my daughter.I give thee to his wishes; I do more--
 I give thee to his virtues.--Yes, Attilia,
 The noble youth deserves this dearest pledge
 Thy father's friendship ever can bestow.wilt thou, canst thou leave me?_Reg._ I am, I am thy father!as a proof,
 I leave thee my example how to suffer.I have a heart within this bosom;

 _Reg._                       Farewell![_Exit._

 _At._ Yes, Regulus!I feel thy spirit here,
 Thy mighty spirit struggling in this breast,
 And it shall conquer all these coward feelings,
 It shall subdue the woman in my soul;
 A Roman virgin should be something more--
 Should dare above her sex's narrow limits--
 And I will dare--and mis'ry shall assist me--
 My father!The hero shall no more disdain his child;
 Attilia shall not be the only branch
 That yields dishonour to the parent tree.is it true that Regulus,
 In spite of senate, people, augurs, friends,
 And children, will depart?_At._                       Yes, it is true._At._                                You forget--
 Barce!_Barce._ Dost thou approve a virtue which must lead
 To chains, to tortures, and to certain death?those chains, those tortures, and that death,
 Will be his triumph._Barce._                Thou art pleas'd, Attilia:
 By heav'n thou dost exult in his destruction![_Weeps._

 _Barce._                   I do not comprehend thee._At._ No, Barce, I believe it.--Why, how shouldst thou?If I mistake not, thou wast born in Carthage,
 In a barbarian land, where never child
 Was taught to triumph in a father's chains._Barce._ Yet thou dost weep--thy tears at least are honest,
 For they refuse to share thy tongue's deceit;
 They speak the genuine language of affliction,
 And tell the sorrows that oppress thy soul._At._ Grief, that dissolves in tears, relieves the heart.When congregated vapours melt in rain,
 The sky is calm'd, and all's serene again.[_Exit._

 _Barce._ Why, what a strange, fantastic land is this!This love of glory's the disease of Rome;
 It makes her mad, it is a wild delirium,
 An universal and contagious frenzy;
 It preys on all, it spares nor sex nor age:
 The Consul envies Regulus his chains--
 He, not less mad, contemns his life and freedom--
 The daughter glories in the father's ruin--
 And Publius, more distracted than the rest,
 Resigns the object that his soul adores,
 For this vain phantom, for this empty glory.This may be virtue; but I thank the gods,
 The soul of Barce's not a Roman soul.[_Exit._

Hyphenation is inconsistent.In view of the Roman context, the word "virtus" was left in place in
a speech by Manlius in Act III, although it may be a misprint for
"virtue".The emptying of a dilated stomach by means of a stomach-tube
will sometimes bring to prominence a gastric tumor.The inflation of the stomach by the development in it of carbonic acid
gas may render valuable assistance in the diagnosis of tumors of this
organ and of surrounding parts.This method has been recommended by W.
Ph.H. Wagner among others, and especially by Rosenbach.[51] From 20 to
30 grains of bicarbonate of soda and from 15 to 20 grains of tartaric
acid may be introduced into the stomach.The soda, dissolved in
lukewarm water, may be given first and followed by the acid in
solution, or, better, the mixed powders may be swallowed in the dry
state and followed by a tumblerful of water.Some persons require a
larger quantity of the powder in order to inflate the stomach.Occasionally the introduction of the effervescing powder fails to
produce any appreciable distension of the stomach.This negative result
may be due to the escape of the gas into the intestine in consequence
of incontinence of the pylorus--a condition which Ebstein[52] has
observed and described especially in connection with pyloric cancer.When this pyloric insufficiency exists the resulting tympanitic
distension of the intestine is a hindrance to palpation of tumors of
the stomach.Failure to secure distension of the stomach is not always
due to this cause.It may be necessary to make repeated trials of the
effervescing mixture.It is well to have a stomach-tube at hand to
evacuate the gas if this should cause much distress.H. Wagner, _Ueber die Percussion des Magens nach
Auftreibung mit Kohlensaure_, Marburg, 1869; O. Rosenbach, _Deutsche
med.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.[Footnote 52: W. Ebstein, _Volkmann's Samml.In some respects simpler and more easily controlled is the method of
{550} distending the stomach by injecting air into it through a
stomach-tube, as recommended by Runeberg.[53] For this purpose the
balloon of a Richardson's spray apparatus may be attached to a
soft-rubber stomach-tube.In this way the desired quantity of air can
be introduced and at any time allowed to escape through the tube.[Footnote 53: J. W. Runeberg, _Deutsches Arch.When the stomach has been inflated the contours of tumors of the
pylorus often become surprisingly distinct in consequence of the
changes in the position and the shape of the stomach.When the tumor is
fixed by adhesions, it may be possible to follow the contours of the
stomach into those of the tumor.False tumors produced by spasm of the
muscular walls of the stomach may be made to disappear by this
distension of the organ.This procedure enables one to distinguish
between tumors behind and those in front of the stomach, as the former
become indistinct or disappear when the stomach is inflated.By
bringing out the contours of the stomach the relations of the tumor to
surrounding organs may be rendered for the first time clear.Assistance
in diagnosis may also be afforded by distension of the colon with water
or with gas or with air, per rectum, in order to determine the course
of the colon and its relations to abdominal tumors (Mader, Ziemssen,
Runeberg).A manifest contraindication to distension of the stomach or
of the colon with gas exists if there is a suspicion that the coats of
these parts are so thinned by ulceration that they might rupture from
the distending force of the gas.There have been no cases recorded
where such an accident has happened.Only in exceptional cases are the bowels regular throughout the course
of gastric cancer.Constipation is the rule, and not infrequently there
is obstinate constipation.This is to be expected when the patient eats
little and vomits a great deal, or when there is stenosis of the
pylorus.In cancer, as in many other diseases of the stomach, the
peristaltic movements of the intestine are inclined to be sluggish.Occasional diarrhoea is also common in gastric cancer, being present,
according to Tripier,[54] at some period or other in over one-half the
cases.Constipation often gives place to diarrhoea during the last
months or during the last days of life.In other periods of the disease
diarrhoea not infrequently alternates with constipation.In rare cases
diarrhoea is an early symptom, and it may be present exceptionally
throughout the greater part of the disease.The irritation of
undigested food sometimes explains the diarrhoea.When diarrhoea is
persistent there probably exists catarrhal inflammation of the large
intestine, or in some instances there may be diphtheritic and
ulcerative inflammation of the colon, causing dysenteric symptoms
during the last stages of cancer of the stomach.[Footnote 54: "Etude clinique sur la Diarrhee dans le Cancer de
l'Estomac," _Lyon Med._, 1881, Nos.Black stools containing altered blood occur for some days after profuse
gastric hemorrhage.It is important to examine the stools for blood, as
bleeding may occur from cancer of the stomach without any vomiting of
blood.There is no change in the urine characteristic of gastric cancer.Deposits of urates are not uncommon.If there be profuse vomiting or
frequent washing out of the stomach, the urine often becomes alkaline
from fixed {551} alkali.[55] The amount of urea is diminished in
consequence of the slight activity of the nutritive processes of the
body.Rommelaere attaches unmerited diagnostic importance to this
diminution of urea.A similar diminution of urea occurs in other like
states of depressed nutrition.[Footnote 55: According to Quincke, when the acid in the stomach is not
hydrochloric acid, but organic acid resulting from fermentation, then
vomiting and washing out the stomach do not reduce the acidity of the
urine (_Zeitschrift f. klin.Albuminuria does not belong to the history of gastric cancer, although
a small quantity of albumen may be present in the urine as in other
anaemic and cachectic conditions.A larger quantity of albumen may be
due to parenchymatous and fatty degeneration of the kidney or to
chronic diffuse nephritis, which are infrequent but recognized
complications of gastric cancer.There is often an excess of indican in
the urine, to which, however, no diagnostic significance can be
attached.The urine in gastric cancer sometimes contains an excess of aceton, or
at least of some substance which yields aceton upon the application of
various tests.This so-called acetonuria is present without any
symptoms referable to it, so far as we know.Allied to this so-called
acetonuria is that condition of the urine in which it is 
burgundy-red upon the addition of ferric chloride in solution
(Gerhardt's reaction).It is not positively known what substance
imparts this last reaction to the urine.V. Jaksch, who has studied the
subject industriously, believes that the red coloring substance is
diacetic acid, and he proposes to call the condition diaceturia.Fresh
urine, which shows in a marked degree Gerhardt's reaction, often has a
peculiar aromatic, fruity odor, as has also the expired air.Gerhardt's
reaction has been studied mostly in diabetic urine, but it occurs
sometimes in cases of gastric cancer and in a variety of diseases.This
so-called diaceturia may be associated with a peculiar form of coma,
but it is oftener observed without any symptoms referable to it[56]
(see page 555).[Footnote 56: The various tests for aceton in the urine are not
altogether satisfactory.They are to be found in an article by Von
Jaksch in the _Zeitschrift f. klin.For
English readers a good abstract of an article by Penzoldt on these
tests and on acetonaemia in general is to be found in _The Medical
News_ of Philadelphia, Aug.162, but this does not consider
the corrections and additions to be found in V. Jaksch's article cited
above.Acetonuria has been observed especially in diabetes mellitus,
fevers, carcinoma, and dyspepsia.The substance which produces Gerhardt's reaction is to be distinguished
from other substances which may be present in the urine and give a red
color with ferric chloride--first, by the fact that boiling the urine
in a test-tube for five or six minutes destroys the first-named
substance, or causes the red color to disappear in case this has been
produced by ferric chloride; and, secondly, by the fact that ether
extracts the substance from acidified urine, and that the red color
produced in the ether extract by ferric chloride (it may be necessary
to first neutralize the acid) fades away in the course of a few days
(V. Jaksch, _Zeitschrift f. Heilkunde_, Bd.Urines which
respond to Gerhardt's reaction in a marked degree yield aceton on
distillation, but aceton or an aceton-yielding substance may be present
in considerable quantity without response of the urine to Gerhardt's
test.]Disorders of nutrition embrace an important group of symptoms, such as
loss of flesh and strength, impoverished blood, and cachectic color of
the skin.Emaciation and debility are sometimes the first symptoms of
gastric cancer to attract attention, and often the first symptoms to
arouse anxiety.More frequently these symptoms of disordered nutrition
first appear after dyspeptic ailments or pain have existed for several
weeks or months.It may aid in the diagnosis of gastric cancer to weigh
the patient {552} from time to time, as carcinoma is generally attended
by progressive loss of weight.The patient frequently becomes morose and depressed in spirits.His
strength fails, sometimes disproportionately to the loss of flesh.There is no disease in which emaciation becomes more extreme than in
cases of gastric cancer.In many cases profound anaemia develops, and sometimes in such a degree
that this symptom cannot be regarded always as simply co-ordinate with
the other disorders of nutrition, but is to be regarded rather as an
evidence of some special disturbance of the blood-forming organs.The
blood may present the same changes as are observed in pernicious
anaemia, such as extreme reduction in the number of red
blood-corpuscles (to one million or even half that number in a cubic
millimeter) and manifold deformed shapes of the corpuscles
(poikilocytosis).In extreme cases the proportion of haemoglobin in the
blood may be reduced to 50 or 60 per cent.[57]
There is occasionally a moderate increase in the number of white
blood-corpuscles.In one case of gastric cancer I observed a
leucocytosis in which there was one white to twenty red
blood-corpuscles without enlargement of the spleen.[58]

[Footnote 57: The granular disintegrating corpuscles
(Zerfallskorperchen of Riess) may also be found in the blood in
considerable number.Leichtenstern has observed that toward the end of
life the relative proportion of haemoglobin in the blood may be
increased, sometimes rapidly, and may even exceed the normal limit.This is due to concentration of the blood in consequence of the loss of
water.In such cases the tissues appear abnormally dry and the blood
thick and tarry at the autopsy (_Ziemssen's Handb.u.
Therap._, Bd.It seems to me proper to distinguish two kinds of anaemia in gastric
cancer--a simple anaemia, which is present in the majority of cases,
and can be explained by the development of the cancer and the
disturbance of the gastric functions; and a pernicious anaemia, which
is present only in exceptional cases, and has the typical symptoms of
progressive pernicious anaemia.][Footnote 58: In a case of large medullary cancer of the stomach
reported by H. Mayer there was one white to fifty red blood-corpuscles.The spleen was not enlarged (Bayer, _Aerztl.Intelligenzblatt_, 1870,
No.A similar case is related by Lebert, in which, however, the
spleen was enlarged (_op.To the pallor of anaemia is added often a faded yellowish tint of the
skin which is considered characteristic of the cancerous cachexia.At
the same time, the skin is frequently dry and harsh, and may present
brownish spots (chloasma cachecticorum).The pallid lips, the pale
greenish-yellow color of the face, the furrowed lines, and the pinched
and despondent expression make up a characteristic physiognomy, which,
however, is neither peculiar to gastric cancer nor present in all cases
of the disease.There is no cachectic appearance which is pathognomonic
of cancer; and in this connection it is well to note that there are
cases of gastric ulcer, and particularly of non-cancerous stenosis of
the pylorus, in which all of the symptoms described as peculiar to the
cancerous cachexia are met with.Nevertheless, the weight of these
symptoms in the diagnosis of gastric cancer should not be
underestimated.There is no disease in which profound cachectic
symptoms so frequently and so rapidly develop as in gastric cancer.The profound nutritive disturbances of gastric cancer are referable
partly to the cancer as such, and partly to the impairment of the
functions of the stomach.It is impossible to separate the effects of
these two sets of causes, and distinguish, as some have done, a
cachexia of cancer {553} and a cachexia of inanition.It is the
combination of these causes which renders the cachexia of cancer of the
stomach so common, so rapid in its development, and so profound as
compared with that of cancer in other situations.The relation of
cancer in general to cachexia need not here be discussed, save to say
that there is the best ground for believing that the cachexia is
directly dependent upon the growth and metamorphoses of the primary
cancer and its metastases, and that there is not reason to assume any
dyscrasia antedating the cancerous formation.While the failure of the general health and the gastric symptoms in
general develop side by side, it is especially significant of gastric
cancer when the symptoms of impaired nutrition are more pronounced than
can be explained by the local gastric disturbance.When, however, as
sometimes happens, gastric symptoms are absent or no more than can be
explained by anaemia and marasmus, then in the absence of tumor a
positive diagnosis is impossible.Such cases of gastric cancer during
life often pass for essential or pernicious anaemia.Otherwise,
unexplained symptoms of anaemia with emaciation and debility,
particularly in elderly people, should lead to a careful search for
gastric cancer.Finally, it is necessary to add that there are exceptional cases of
gastric cancer in which there is no emaciation, and in which the
general health appears to be astonishingly well preserved.In most of
these cases death occurs either from some accident of the disease or
from some complication.Slight or moderate oedema about the ankles is a common symptom during
the cachectic stage of gastric cancer.This oedema is due to hydraemia.This cachectic dropsy in rare cases becomes excessive and leads to
anasarca, with serous effusion in the peritoneal, pleural, and
pericardial sacs.Such cases are liable to be mistaken for heart
disease, particularly as a haemic murmur often coexists, or for
Bright's disease.Ascites may be the result not only of hydraemia, but
also of cancerous peritonitis or of pressure on the portal vein by
cancer.Many cases of gastric cancer associated with ascites have been
falsely diagnosed as cirrhosis of the liver, and sometimes the
distinction is extremely difficult or impossible.During the greater part of the disease the pulse is usually normal;
toward the end it is not infrequently rapid, small, and compressible.In consequence of weakness and anaemia any exertion may suffice to
increase the frequency of the pulse, and may induce palpitation of the
heart and syncope.As might be expected as the result of anaemia, haemic murmurs in the
heart and blood-vessels are not rare in gastric cancer.Epigastric pulsation is often very prominent in cases of gastric
cancer, as it may be in various other conditions.This pulsation is
sometimes of a paroxysmal nature.Venous thrombosis is not a rare complication in the last stages of
gastric cancer.It is most common in the femoral and saphenous veins,
and is rapidly followed by painful oedematous swelling of the affected
extremity.Thrombosis of the subclavian and axillary veins is much less
frequent.When it occurs there are the same symptoms of phlegmasia alba
dolens in the upper extremity as have been mentioned for the lower.Lebert has recorded a case of thrombosis of the right external jugular
{554} vein.[59] The thrombosis is the result of marasmus, and therefore
may occur in other gastric diseases besides gastric cancer, so that
this symptom has not all the diagnostic importance for gastric cancer
claimed by Trousseau.Being an evidence of great weakness of the
circulation, marantic thrombosis in cancer of the stomach is of grave
prognostic import.The temperature is often normal throughout the course of gastric
cancer.Febrile attacks, however, are not uncommon in this disease.Elevation of temperature may occur without any complication to explain
it.During the second half of the disease there may be either irregular
febrile attacks or a more continuous fever, which is, however, usually
of a light grade, the temperature not generally exceeding 102 degrees.Lebert describes a light and a hectic
carcinomatous fever.There may be subnormal temperature with collapse during the last days
of life, and in general anaemia and inactivity of nutritive processes
tend to produce a low temperature.Dyspnoea on slight exertion may be present in gastric cancer as a
result of anaemia or of fatty heart.In a few cases of gastric cancer
have been observed symptoms pointing to a reflex vagus neurosis, such
as paroxysms of dyspnoea, oppression in the chest, and palpitation of
the heart, but these symptoms are less common in gastric cancer than in
some other diseases of the stomach.Watson[60] relates a case of
gastric cancer in which increasing dyspnoea and palpitation were such
prominent symptoms that he was led to diagnose fatty heart with portal
congestion as the sole trouble.At the autopsy the heart and lungs were
found healthy, but there was extensive cancer of the greater curvature
of the stomach.He subsequently ascertained that there had been
symptoms pointing to gastric disease.[Footnote 60: Sir T. Watson, _Lectures on the Principles and Practice
of Physic_, vol.The various complications of gastric cancer which affect the
respiratory organs will be considered later.Depression of spirits, lack of energy, headache, neuralgia,
sleeplessness, and vertigo are functional nervous disturbances which
are often the result of disordered digestion from whatever cause, and
are therefore not uncommon in gastric cancer.The theory that these
symptoms are due to the absorption of noxious substances produced in
the stomach and intestine by abnormal digestive processes is
plausible,[61] and more intelligible than reference to some undefined
sympathy between the digestive organs and the nervous system.[Footnote 61: This theory is elaborated by Senator ("Ueber
Selbstinfection durch abnorme Zersetzungsvorgange, etc.," _Zeitschrift
f. klin.The intelligence is generally not impaired in the course of gastric
cancer.Considerable interest belongs to coma as a symptom of cancer of the
stomach, and more particularly to the occurrence of coma with the
peculiar characters which have been described by Kussmaul as
distinguishing diabetic coma.[62] The most distinctive feature in
Kussmaul's group of symptoms is the accompaniment of the coma by a
peculiar {555} dyspnoea in which, without evidence of disease of the
lungs or air-passages, the respirations are strong and deep and often
attended with a groaning sound in expiration.The breathing is either
normal in frequency or oftener moderately increased.The temperature is not much elevated, and
sometimes is much below the normal.Sometimes the coma is preceded by a
period of excitement, with restlessness, and perhaps with screaming.Gerhardt's reaction in the urine may or may not be present.When it is
present in a marked degree there is often an aromatic, chloroform-like
odor to the breath and to the fresh urine.The patient may come out of
the coma, but in the vast majority of cases the coma terminates
fatally.[Footnote 62: _Deutsches Arch.It is now known that this dyspnoeic coma is not confined to diabetes
mellitus, but that it occurs also in gastric cancer and in various
other diseases.[63] Its occurrence in gastric cancer is rare.In this
disease it does not usually appear until anaemia is far advanced, but
it may occur in cases of cancer in which the patient's general health
and nutrition are still fairly good.I recently made the post-mortem
examination of an elderly man, fairly well nourished, who was found in
the streets comatose and brought in this condition to Bellevue
Hospital, where he died in about twelve hours.While in the hospital
his breathing was increased in frequency, forcible, and deep.The urine contained a small quantity of
albumen, but no sugar.At the autopsy was found a large, soft, ulcerated
cancer of the lesser curvature and posterior wall of the stomach near
the pylorus.The kidneys, brain, heart, and other organs were
essentially healthy.[Footnote 63: Von Jaksch was the first to describe this form of coma in
cancer of the stomach (_Wien.Wochenschr._, 1883, pp.He adopted the term coma carcinomatosum, and more recently coma
diaceticum.L. Riess has reported seventeen cases of this coma
occurring in a variety of diseases, such as pernicious anaemia, gastric
cancer, gastric ulcer, tuberculosis, which all had in common profound
anaemia.He proposes the term dyspnoeic coma (_Zeitschrift f. klin.Senator has described two
cases of gastric cancer with this coma.He uses the terms dyscrasic
coma and Kussmaul's group of symptoms (_ibid._, Bd.In the
cases described by Litten under the name coma dyspepticum, dyspnoea was
absent, but Gerhardt's reaction in the urine was present.In Litten's
cases structural disease of the stomach was not supposed to be present.The patients recovered from the coma (_ibid._, Suppl.We possess no satisfactory explanation of this form of coma.In
diabetes it is considered to be due to the presence in the blood of
some intoxicating agent.For a time this agent was thought to be
aceton; it is now believed by Von Jaksch to be diacetic acid.Much
stress has been laid upon the aromatic, fruity odor of the breath and
of the fresh urine, and upon the presence of some substance in the
urine which imparts to it a burgundy-red color upon the addition of
liquor ferri chloridi (Gerhardt's reaction.See changes in the urine,
page 551).Although the whole aceton question is at present in a very
confused state, there is no proof that aceton or its allies possesses
the toxic properties assumed by this theory;[64] and it is certain that
dyspnoeic coma may occur in diabetes and in other diseases without the
presence of Gerhardt's reaction in the urine.It is also true that this
reaction often occurs without any clinical symptoms referable to it.Riess and Senator believe that in non-diabetic {556} cases anaemia is
the most important factor in the production of this coma.[65]

[Footnote 64: Frerichs, _Zeitschrift f. klin.[Footnote 65: Riess refers the coma to the anaemia as such, whereas
Senator thinks that, in consequence of the depraved nutrition of the
body resulting from the anaemia, some toxic substance is developed
which enters the circulation.]Coma, probably belonging to this same variety, may occur in gastric
cancer without the peculiar dyspnoea which has been described.There is
reason to believe that this dyspnoea is not a necessary symptom of the
so-called diabetic coma.Chronic Bright's disease terminating with uraemic coma is an occasional
but not frequent complication of gastric cancer.Coma and other cerebral symptoms may be produced by secondary cancerous
tumors in the brain.Stupor deepening into coma may develop during the often-prolonged
death-agony of gastric cancer.The distribution, origin, and frequency of cancerous growths secondary
to gastric cancer are most conveniently considered under Pathological
Anatomy.Symptoms referable to certain localizations of these secondary
cancerous deposits, however, are so common, and so interwoven with the
clinical history of cancer of the stomach, that it is desirable to
consider some of these symptoms in the present connection.Cancer of the liver is the most important of these secondary cancerous
growths.It is estimated to be present in nearly one-third of the cases
of gastric cancer, but by no means in all these cases does it produce
symptoms.As a rule, the earlier hepatic cancer forms in the course of
gastric cancer the more likely is it to be attended by symptoms.The
most important symptoms of secondary cancer of the liver are
enlargement of the liver, peritoneal exudation, and persistent icterus.When nodular growths can be felt in the free border or surface of the
liver, the diagnosis is generally easily established.Sometimes the
liver remains of normal size or is even contracted, and then the
diagnosis is difficult or impossible.Ascites or exudative peritonitis
is present in about one-half of the cases of cancer of the liver.It is only persistent jaundice
which aids in the diagnosis of hepatic cancer.The various combinations of gastric cancer with secondary hepatic
cancer may be clinically grouped as follows:

1.Symptoms of gastric cancer with latent hepatic cancer.Symptoms of gastric cancer followed by symptoms of hepatic cancer.Symptoms both of gastric cancer and of hepatic cancer present when
the case comes under observation.Symptoms of hepatic cancer with latent gastric cancer.Symptoms of hepatic cancer followed by symptoms of gastric cancer.Symptoms of anaemia and
marasmus, or of chronic exudative peritonitis, or of chronic pleurisy.From this grouping it is evident that the existence of secondary
hepatic cancer may aid in the diagnosis of cancer of the stomach, or
may mislead, or may be without influence.The greatest assistance in
diagnosis is rendered when the physical signs and the symptoms of
hepatic {557} cancer develop some time after the appearance of gastric
symptoms which may previously have been equivocal.Much more difficult
to diagnosticate are the cases of hepatic cancer accompanied or
followed by gastric symptoms, inasmuch as cancer of the liver, whether
primary or secondary, may be attended with marked disturbance of the
gastric functions, including haematemesis.In these cases, unless a
tumor of the stomach can be discovered, a positive diagnosis of gastric
cancer is impossible.In view of the infrequency of primary cancer of
the liver, however, there will be in many of these cases a strong
probability in favor of primary cancer of the stomach.When it is
remembered that over one-third of the cancers of the liver are
secondary to cancer of the stomach, it is evident that in cases which
appear to be primary hepatic cancer very careful attention should be
given to the exploration of the stomach.But even then diagnostic
errors will often be unavoidable.Cancer of the peritoneum secondary to cancer of the stomach may produce
no symptoms, and so pass unrecognized.The diagnosis of peritoneal
cancer is readily made when, after the recognition of gastric cancer,
secondary cancerous nodules in the peritoneum can be felt through the
abdominal walls or through the vagina.There are cases of gastric
cancer in which the symptoms are all referable to secondary cancer of
the peritoneum.Cancer of the peritoneum is usually attended with fluid
exudation in the peritoneal cavity.The chemical and the microscopical
examination of this fluid withdrawn by paracentesis may aid in the
diagnosis of cancerous peritonitis.Whereas in dropsical accumulations
in the peritoneal cavity the quantity of albumen in the fluid is
usually less than 2-1/2 per cent., in cancerous peritonitis there is
usually from 3 to 4 per cent.of albumen, the percentage rarely falling
as low as 2-1/2 per cent., but sometimes being as high as from 5 to 6
per cent.The percentage of albumen in ordinary peritonitis is usually
over 4.[66] Clumps of cancer-cells are sometimes to be found by
microscopical examination of the fluid.These cells are large,
epithelioid in shape, and often contain vacuoles and fatty granules.It
is only when these cells are arranged in clumps or as so-called budding
cells, and when they are present in abundance, that they are
diagnostic.They are to be sought especially in fibrinous coagula.They
are present only when the cancerous alveoli actually communicate with
the peritoneal cavity.[67] The development of cancerous nodules in the
margins of an opening made in the abdominal walls by a trocar is also
evidence of cancerous disease of the peritoneum.The same thickening
and retraction of the mesentery and omentum may occur in cancerous as
in tuberculous peritonitis.In both the exudation is often hemorrhagic.[Footnote 66: The conditions under which the estimation of the quantity
of albumen in the peritoneal exudation may prove of diagnostic aid are
fully considered by Runeberg (_Deutsches Arch.Here also are given methods for making this analysis for
clinical purposes.][Footnote 67: The literature on this subject is as follows: Foulis,
_Brit.2, 1878; Thornton, _ibid._, Sept.7,
1878; Quincke, _Deutsches Arch.580;
Ehrlich, _Charite Annalen_, vii.226; Brieger, _ibid._, viii.]Importance has been attached to enlargement of the supraclavicular
lymphatic glands in the diagnosis of cancer of the stomach, but there
are so many causes of enlargement of these glands that not much
significance can be attached to this symptom, which, moreover, is
absent in most {558} cases.Still, under certain circumstances this
glandular enlargement may aid in the diagnosis.The same remarks apply
to enlargement of the inguinal glands, which is a common occurrence in
case cancer involves the peritoneum.One must not mistake abnormal
prominence of the lymphatic glands in consequence of emaciation for
actual enlargement.Gastric cancer much less frequently than gastric ulcer causes
perforation of the stomach.Of 507 cases of gastric cancer collected by
Brinton, perforation into the general peritoneal cavity occurred in 17
(3-1/3 per cent.).[68] In two cases of gastric cancer reported by Ellis
perforative peritonitis was preceded by symptoms supposed to be only
those of ordinary dyspepsia, hemorrhage and vomiting being absent.[69]
Various fistulous communications like those described under gastric
ulcer may be the result of perforation of gastric cancer, but with the
exception of gastro-colic fistula they are much more frequently
produced by ulcer than by cancer.In 160 cases of gastric cancer
collected by Dittrich, gastro-colic fistula existed in 6 (3-3/4 per
cent.).[70] In 507 cases collected by Brinton this fistula existed in
11 (2.17 per cent.).In Lange's 210 cases gastro-colic fistula existed
in 8 (3.8 per cent.).Of 33 cases of gastro-colic fistula collected by
Murchison, 21 were caused by cancerous ulceration.[71] The symptoms
characteristic of fistulous communication between the stomach and the
colon are the vomiting of fecal matter and the passage of undigested
food by the stools.These symptoms are not present in all cases, so
that a diagnosis is not always possible.Fecal vomiting is influenced
by the size of the opening between the stomach and the colon.With
great obstruction at the pylorus, fecal vomiting, as might be expected,
is absent or infrequent, while the passage of undigested food by the
bowels is common.Under these circumstances vomiting is sometimes
relieved after the establishment of the fistula.Aid may be afforded in
the diagnosis of gastro-colic fistula by the introduction into the
rectum or into the stomach of  or other easily recognizable
substances, and determining their presence in the vomit or in the
stools in consequence of their escape by the unnatural outlet.V.
Ziemssen has determined in a case of gastro-colic fistula due to cancer
the escape into the stomach of carbonic acid gas artificially generated
in the rectum, with failure to obtain distension of the colon.[72] A
number of instances of gastro-cutaneous fistula due to gastric cancer
have been recorded, but this form of fistula is much less common than
gastro-colic fistula, and much less frequently the result of cancer
than of ulcer of the stomach.Subcutaneous emphysema may precede the
formation of the fistula.Other gastric fistulous communications
resulting from cancer, such as with the pleura, the lungs, the small
intestine, are too infrequent to merit consideration under the
symptomatology of the disease.cit._) records in 210 cases of
gastric cancer 12 perforations into the peritoneal cavity (5.7 per
cent.).][Footnote 70: _Prager Vierteljahrsch._, vol.[Footnote 72: _Deutsches Arch.He
recommends for extreme distension of the colon in an adult the
introduction, by means of a tube passed up the rectum, of a solution of
about 5 drachms of sodii bicarb.and 4-1/2 drachms of tartaric
acid--injected not all at once, but in three or four doses at intervals
of a few minutes, the tube being cleaned in the intervals by the
injection of three ounces of water, so as to avoid generation of gas in
the tube.The generation of a smaller quantity of gas would suffice for
the purpose here in view.]{559} As a rule, patients with gastric cancer die from gradual
exhaustion.In a condition of extreme emaciation and feebleness the
patient sinks into a state of collapse, accompanied often with stupor,
sometimes with mild delirium.The death-agony is prolonged frequently
from twelve to twenty-four hours, and sometimes even longer.On the
other hand, death may occur somewhat suddenly in the last stages of
gastric cancer, and without satisfactory explanation.Death from copious gastric hemorrhage does not occur probably in more
than 1 per cent.In the rare cases of death from perforation of the stomach the patient
is sometimes so exhausted at the time of perforation that the
occurrence of this accident remains unrecognized in the absence of any
complaint of characteristic symptoms.The coma which sometimes leads to the fatal termination of gastric
cancer has already been sufficiently considered.Finally, death may be the result of certain complications more or less
dependent upon the cancer.Of these the most important are suppurative
peritonitis and pulmonary complications, particularly oedema, terminal
pneumonia, and embolism of the pulmonary artery.DURATION.--It is evidently impossible to determine the exact duration
of a cancer of the stomach.Doubtless in all cases there is a period of
growth of the tumor before it produces symptoms, and the duration of
this latent period can never be determined.When symptoms appear they
are often at first so mild as to be readily overlooked, and so
ambiguous that even if recognized they are not clearly referable to the
cancer.Gastric symptoms may have preceded, perhaps for years, the
development of the cancer, so as to lead to the assumption of a longer
duration of the cancer than is really the case.Estimates, therefore,
of the duration of gastric cancer can be only of limited value.From 198 cases Brinton[73] estimates the average duration of gastric
cancer as about twelve and a half months, the maximum duration as about
thirty-six months, and the minimum as one month.From 36 cases
Katzenellenbogen[74] estimates the average duration as eighteen months,
the maximum as five years and five months, the minimum as one month.From 112 cases Lebert[75] makes the average duration fifteen months and
the maximum four years.of the cases Lebert found the
duration less than three months, in 62 per cent.between six and
eighteen months, in 42 per cent.between six and twelve months, in 17
per cent.between three and six months, and in the same number of cases
between eighteen months and four years.cit._]

[Footnote 74: _Op.cit._]

[Footnote 75: _Op.cit._]

Estimates of several years' duration (such as nine years in the case of
Napoleon) are to be received with scepticism.In these cases symptoms
of gastralgia or of dyspepsia or of gastric ulcer have preceded the
development of the cancer.It has already been mentioned that cancer
may develop in a simple ulcer of the stomach.Mathieu,[76] from an analysis of 27 cases of gastric cancer occurring
under thirty-four years, found the average duration in early life to be
only three months.In only 2 out of 19 cases did the duration exceed
one year.Although this analysis is based upon too small a number of
cases, there {560} seems to be no doubt that gastric cancer pursues a
more rapid course in early life than it does in old people.[Footnote 76: _Du Cancer precoce de l'Estomac_, Paris, 1884, p.COMPLICATIONS.--Some of the complications of gastric cancer have been
mentioned under Symptomatology.Jaundice may appear in the course of
gastric cancer from a variety of causes, such as catarrhal
gastro-duodenitis, impaction of gall-stones in the common bile-duct,
and pressure on the bile-duct by cancerous growths in the pancreas, in
the portal lymphatic glands, or in the liver itself.Pylethrombosis,
which is likely to be suppurative, is a rare complication.In a case of
cancer of the anterior wall and greater curvature of the stomach
reported by Wickham Legg[77] the symptoms seem to have been mostly
referable to a complicating suppurative pylethrombosis.Simple and
cancerous pylethromboses also occur.Other forms of peritonitis than
the cancerous may complicate gastric cancer, such as suppurative,
sero-fibrinous, and chronic proliferative peritonitis.Catarrhal
enteritis, and particularly diphtheritic colitis, are not infrequent
complications, especially in the later stages of the disease.Chronic
diffuse nephritis, both in the form of the large and of the small
kidney, is a rare complication of cancer of the stomach.Hydrothorax,
sero-fibrinous pleurisy, and emphysema may develop either with or
without cancerous invasion of the pleura.Pericarditis is much less
common; it is most likely to occur with cancer of the cardia.Pyo-pneumothorax, abscess, and gangrene of the lung may result from
perforation of the pleura or of the lung by gastric cancer.Oedema of
the lungs, splenization, and pneumonia, involving usually the lower
lobes, are common in the last days of gastric cancer.Emboli derived
from venous thrombi are sometimes carried into the pulmonary artery or
its branches.Although much has been written as to the exclusion of
tuberculosis by cancer, no such law exists.Both old and fresh
tubercles have been repeatedly observed in cases of gastric cancer.Reference has already been made to the frequent development of aphthae
in the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus in the final stage of gastric
cancer.Fatty degeneration of the heart may develop in gastric cancer
as in other anaemic states.Phlegmasia alba dolens has already been
mentioned.It is not probable that insanity is to be regarded as more
than an accidental complication of gastric cancer; still, it has been
noticed in several cases--for instance, of Dittrich's 160 cases, 5
patients were insane, 2 with violent mania.Amyloid degeneration has
been present in some cases.Purpura haemorrhagica has been present in a
few instances in the later stages (cachectic purpura).Chronic
catarrhal gastritis and dilatation of the stomach are less
complications than a part of the disease.The relation of cancer to
simple ulcer of the stomach has already been considered.The various
secondary cancerous deposits are most conveniently considered under the
Morbid Anatomy.It is to be remarked that many of the complications of
gastric cancer--as, for instance, pneumonia and peritonitis--may have a
very obscure clinical history, as they often occur when the patient is
greatly prostrated.MORBID ANATOMY.--The following table gives the situation of the tumor
in 1300 cases of cancer of the stomach:[78] {561}

  Pyloric region.791  60.8%
  Lesser curvature.148  11.4%
  Cardia.104   8.0%
  Posterior wall.68   5.2%
  The whole or the greater
    part of the stomach.61   4.7%
  Multiple tumors.45   3.5%
  Greater curvature.34   2.6%
  Anterior wall.30   2.3%
  Fundus.19   1.5%

From this table it appears that three-fifths of all gastric cancers
occupy the pyloric region, but it is not to be understood that in all
of these cases the pylorus itself is involved.In four-fifths of the
cases the comparatively small segment of the stomach represented by the
cardia, the lesser curvature, and the pyloric region is the part
affected by gastric cancer.The lesser curvature and the anterior and
the posterior walls are involved more frequently than appears from the
table, inasmuch as many cancers assigned to the pyloric region extend
to these parts.The fundus is the least frequent seat of cancer.In the
cases classified as involving the greater part of the stomach the
fundus often escapes.[Footnote 78: These cases are collected from the following sources:
Lebert, _op.cit._; Prague statistics of Dittrich, Engel, Wrany, and
Eppinger, _loc.cit._; Habershon, _op.cit._; Katzenellenbogen, _op.cit._; and Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter, _loc.cit._ Gussenbauer and
V. Winiwarter assign to the class of cancers involving the whole
stomach all cases which they found designated simply as carcinoma
ventriculi without further description.This produces in their
statistics an excessive number of cancers under this class.I have
preferred, therefore, to estimate in their collection of cases the
number of cancers involving the whole stomach, according to the
percentage for this class obtained from the other authors above cited.]As was shown by Rokitansky, it is the exception for cancer of the
pylorus to extend into the duodenum, whereas cancer of the cardia
usually invades for a certain distance the oesophagus.The varieties of carcinoma which develop primarily in the stomach are
scirrhous, medullary, colloid, and cylindrical epithelial
carcinoma.[79] The distinction between scirrhous and medullary cancer
is based upon the difference in consistence, the former being hard and
the latter soft.Cylindrical-celled epithelioma cannot be recognized as
such by the naked eye.It presents usually the gross appearances of
medullary cancer.Soft cancer (including both cylindrical-celled
epithelioma and medullary carcinoma) is the most frequent form of
gastric cancer.Next in frequency is scirrhous cancer, and then comes
colloid cancer, which, although not rare, is much less frequent than
the other varieties.[Footnote 79: I have not been able to find an authentic instance of
primary melanotic cancer of the stomach, although this form is included
by most authors in the list of primary gastric cancers.It is known
that most cases formerly described as melanotic cancers are melanotic
sarcomata, which originate usually in the skin or the eye and are
accompanied frequently with abundant metastases.Secondary melanotic
tumors have been several times found in the stomach.They were present
in 7 out of 50 cases of melanotic cancer (or sarcoma) analyzed by
Eiselt, although out of 104 cases not a single primary melanotic cancer
occurred in the stomach (_Prager Viertaljahrschr._, vol.The list of secondary melanotic sarcomata of the stomach might be still
further increased.Of course gastric cancers  by pigment from
old blood-extravasations should not be confounded with melanotic
tumors.]As all degrees of combination and of transition exist between the
different forms of cancer, and as a large number of cancers of the
stomach are of a medium consistence and would be classified by some
observers as scirrhous and by others as medullary, statistics as to the
relative frequency of the different varieties have very little value.Moreover, in most statistics upon this point there is no evidence that
simple fibrous growths have not been confounded with scirrhous cancer,
and as a rule {562} little or no account is taken of cylindrical-celled
epithelioma, which is a common form of gastric cancer--according to
Cornil and Ranvier, the most common.[80]

[Footnote 80: For any who may be interested in such statistics I have
collected 1221 cases of gastric cancer, of which 791 (64.8 per cent.)were medullary, 399 (32.7 per cent.)scirrhous, and 31 (2.5 per cent.)22 cases described as epithelial have been included with the
medullary; 29 cases described as fibro-medullary, and 1 as
fasciculated, have been included with the scirrhous.The cases are from
the previously-cited statistics of Lebert, Dittrich, Wrany, Eppinger,
Gussenbauer, and V. Winiwarter, and from Fenger (_Virchow u. Hirsch's
Jahresbericht_, 1874, Bd.Cancer of the stomach may grow in the form of a more or less complete
ring around the circumference of the stomach, or as a circumscribed
tumor projecting into the cavity of the stomach, or as a diffuse
infiltration of the walls of the stomach.The annular form of growth is
observed most frequently in the pyloric region.Cancerous tumors which
project into the interior of the stomach are sometimes broad and
flattened, sometimes fungoid in shape, but most frequently they appear
as round or oval, more rarely irregular, crater-like ulcers, with
thickened, prominent walls and ragged floor.The free surface of the
tumor presents sometimes a cauliflower-like or dendritic appearance,
which characterizes the so-called villous cancer.Diffuse cancerous
infiltration is seated oftenest in the right half of the stomach, but
it may occupy the cardiac region or even the entire stomach.The relation of the cancerous growth to the coats of the stomach varies
in different cases.The tumor usually begins in the mucous membrane and
rapidly extends through the muscularis mucosae into the submucous coat.In this lax connective-tissue coat the tumor spreads often more rapidly
than in the mucous membrane, so that it may appear as if the cancer
originated in the submucosa.The mucous membrane, however, is usually
invaded, sooner or later, over the whole extent of the tumor.The dense
muscular coat offers more resistance to the invasion of the tumor.Cancerous masses, however, penetrate along the connective-tissue septa
between the muscular bundles, which often increase in number and size.In the muscular coat thus thickened can be seen the opaque white
fibrous and cancerous septa enclosing the grayish, translucent bundles
of smooth muscular tissue.Often, however, the whole muscular coat
beneath the tumor is replaced by the cancerous growth, and can no
longer be recognized.The serous and subserous connective tissue, like
the submucous coat, offers a favorable soil for the growth of the
tumor, which here appears usually in the form of large and small
nodules projecting from the peritoneum.Adhesions now form between the
stomach and surrounding parts, and opportunity is offered for the
continuous growth of the cancer into these parts.In the manner
described the tumor grows in all directions, sometimes more in depth,
sometimes more laterally, sometimes more into the interior of the
stomach.Ulceration occurs in all forms of gastric cancer.[81] The ulceration is
caused either by fatty degeneration and molecular disintegration of the
surface of the tumor or by the separation of sloughy masses.Doubtless
the solvent action of the gastric juice aids in the process.The softer
and {563} the more rapid the growth of the cancer, the more extensive
is likely to be the ulcer.Such ulcers are usually round or oval in
shape, but their contours may be irregular from the coalescence of two
or more ulcers or from serpiginous growth.The edges are usually high,
soft in consistence, and often beset with polypoid excrescences.The
floor is generally sloughy and soft, and often presents warty
outgrowths.The edges and floor may, however, be hard and smooth.In
the more slowly-growing scirrhous and colloid cancers the ulcers are
more likely to be superficial.Partial cicatrization of cancerous
ulcers may take place.The development of cicatricial tissue may
destroy the cancerous elements to such an extent that only by careful
microscopical examination can the distinction be made between cancer
and simple ulcer or fibroid induration.The examination of secondary
cancerous deposits in adjacent lymphatic glands or other parts becomes,
then, an important aid in the diagnosis.[Footnote 81: Ulceration was present in 60 per cent.of Lebert's cases,
and in 66-1/2 per cent.of Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's pyloric
cancers.]Suppuration has been known to occur in gastric cancers, but it is
extremely rare.Each form of gastric cancer has certain peculiarities which require
separate consideration.Medullary carcinoma grows more rapidly than the other varieties of
cancer.It forms usually soft masses, which project into the stomach
and are prone to break down in the centre and develop into the
crater-like ulcers already described.All of the coats of the stomach
are rapidly invaded by the growth.The consistence of the tumor is
soft, the color upon section whitish or reddish-gray, sometimes over a
considerable extent hemorrhagic.Milky juice can be freely scraped from
the cut surface of the tumor.The so-called villous cancer and the
haematodes fungus are varieties of medullary carcinoma.Medullary
carcinoma is more frequently accompanied by metastases than the other
forms.In consequence of its tendency to deep ulceration medullary
cancer is more liable to give rise to hemorrhage and to perforation
than is scirrhous or colloid cancer.The continuous new formation of
cancerous tissue in the floor of the ulcer and the formation of
adhesions, however, greatly lessen the danger of perforation into the
peritoneal cavity.Histologically, medullary cancer is composed of a scanty stroma of
connective tissue enclosing an abundance of cancerous alveoli filled
with polyhedrical or cylindrical epithelial cells.The stroma is often
richly infiltrated with lymphoid cells, and contains blood-vessels
which often present irregular dilatations of their lumen.Waldeyer describes with much detail, for this as for the other forms of
gastric cancer, the origin of the tumor from the gastric tubules.According to his description, a group of gastric tubules, ten to twenty
in number, sends prolongations downward into the submucous coat.These
tubular prolongations are filled with proliferating epithelial cells,
which make their way into the lymphatic spaces of the surrounding
tissue and give origin to the cells in the cancerous alveoli.A
small-celled infiltration of the surrounding connective tissue
accompanies this growth of the tubules.The tissue beneath and at the margins of medullary cancer may be
predominantly fibrous in texture and contain comparatively few
cancerous alveoli.This scirrhous base is often exposed after the
destruction of the greater part of the soft cancer by ulceration and
sloughing.It is {564} probable that many of the scirrhous cancers are
formed in this way secondarily to medullary cancer (Ziegler).Cylindrical-celled epithelioma presents the same gross appearances and
the same tendency to ulceration and to the formation of metastases
which characterize medullary cancer.The consistence of cylindrical
epithelioma may, however, be firm like that of scirrhus.Not
infrequently the alveoli are distended with mucus secreted by the
lining epithelium, and then the tumor presents in whole or in part
appearances similar to colloid cancer.Upon microscopical examination are seen spaces resembling more or less
closely sections of tubular glands.These spaces are lined with
columnar epithelium.Often in certain parts of the tumor the alveolar
spaces are filled with cells, so that the structure is a combination of
that of ordinary cancer and of epithelioma.The stroma is generally
scanty and rich in cells, but it may be abundant.Cysts may be present
in this form of tumor, and in one case I have found such cysts nearly
filled with papillary growths covered with cylindrical epithelium, so
that the appearance resembled closely that of the so-called proliferous
cysto-sarcoma of the breast.The origin of cylindrical epithelioma from the gastric tubules is
generally accepted, and is more readily demonstrable than the similar
origin claimed for the other forms of gastric cancer.Scirrhous cancer assumes often the form of a diffuse thickening and
induration of the gastric walls, particularly in the pyloric region,
where it causes stenosis of the pyloric orifice.Scirrhus may, however,
appear as a circumscribed tumor.Irregular hard nodules frequently
project from diffuse scirrhous growths into the interior of the
stomach.Scirrhous cancer and medullary cancer are often combined with
each other.The dense consistence of scirrhous cancer is due to the predominance of
the fibrous stroma, the cancerous alveoli being relatively small in
size and few in number.Colloid cancer generally appears as a more or less uniform thickening
of the gastric walls.All of the coats of the stomach are converted
into the colloid growth.Nearly the whole of the stomach may be invaded
by the new growth.[82] The tumor has a tendency to spread to the omenta
and to the rest of the peritoneum, where it may form enormous masses,
but it rarely gives rise to metastases in the interior of organs.Colloid cancer may, however, form a circumscribed projecting tumor in
the stomach, and in rare instances it causes abundant secondary colloid
deposits in the liver, the lungs, and other parts.[Footnote 82: In a case reported by Storer the whole stomach, except a
little of the left extremity over an extent of about an inch, was
converted into a colloid mass in which no trace of the normal coats of
the stomach could be made out.The colloid growth replacing the gastric
wall measured seven-eighths of an inch in thickness in the pyloric
region.Digestion was less disturbed in this case than in most cases of
gastric cancer (_Boston Med.In
Amidon's case (reported in the _Trans.38) there seems to have been an equally extensive colloid
metamorphosis of the stomach.]Colloid cancer presents, even to the naked eye, an exquisite alveolar
structure, whence the name alveolar cancer as a designation of this
tumor.Bands of opaque white or gray connective tissue enclose alveolar
meshes which are filled with the gelatinous, pellucid colloid {565}
substance.This colloid material is thought to be produced by a colloid
transformation of the epithelial cells in the alveoli, but the same
transformation seems to occur also in the stroma.Few or no intact
epithelial cells may be found in the alveoli.Colloid metamorphosis may
take place in all forms of gastric cancer, but it is particularly
common in cylindrical epithelioma.Colloid cancer may originate in the
peritoneum unconnected with any glandular structures.It occurs often
at an earlier age than other forms of cancer.Deep ulceration rarely
attacks colloid cancer.Flat-celled epithelioma is found at the cardiac orifice and as a
metastatic growth in other parts of the stomach.Originating in the
oesophagus, it may extend downward into the stomach.By noting whether
the structure is that of squamous or of cylindrical epithelioma it is
often possible to determine whether a tumor at the cardiac orifice
originates in the oesophagus or in the stomach.Secondary cancer of the stomach, although rare, is not such a curiosity
as is often represented.Without aiming at completeness, I have been
able to collect 37 cases of secondary cancer of the stomach, of which
the larger number will stand critical examination.[83] Of these cases,
17 were secondary to cancer of the breast, 8 to cancer of the
oesophagus, 3 to cancer of the mouth or nose, and the remainder to
cancer of other parts of the body.The large number of cases secondary
to cancer of the breast is explained by the large statistics relating
to mammary cancer which were consulted.Gastric cancer is more
frequently secondary to cancer of the oesophagus than to cancer of any
other part.In this category of course are not included cases of
continuous growth of oesophageal cancer into the stomach, but only
metastatic cancers of the stomach.A part at least of the gastric
cancers secondary to cancer of the alimentary tract above the stomach I
refer, with Klebs, to implantation in the mucous membrane of the
stomach of cancerous particles detached from the primary growth in the
oesophagus, pharynx, or mouth.This view is supported by the absence in
some cases of any involvement of the lymphatic glands.The secondary
deposits in the stomach conform in structure to the primary growth.They are usually situated in the submucous coat, where they form one or
often several distinctly circumscribed tumors.The secondary tumors may
or may not ulcerate.[Footnote 83: These cases are from Dittrich, 2 (the remainder of his
cases I rejected); Cohnheim, 1; Petri, 2; Klebs, 3; Lucke, 1; Weigert,
1; Coupland, 1; Cruse, 1; Hausmann, 1; Bartholow, 1; Oldekop, 5; Edes,
1; V. Torok and V. Wittelshofer, 8; Grawitz, 4; Haren Noman, 5.So-called melanotic cancers, cancers involving only the serous coat of
the stomach, and those extending by continuous growth into the stomach,
are not included in this list.]Primary cancers may be present at the same time in different organs of
the body; for instance, in the uterus and in the stomach.[84] The
possibility of multiple primary cancers is to be borne in mind in
considering some of the apparently secondary cancers of the stomach, as
well as in determining whether certain cancers are secondary to gastric
cancer or not.Here the microscopical examination is often
decisive.[85]

[Footnote 84: Case of A. Clark's (_Trans.260), and a similar one reported by J. B. S. Jackson in _Extr.[Footnote 85: The subject of multiple primary cancers is considered by
Kauffmann (_Virchow's Arch._, Bd.317), and by Beck (_Prager
med.Wochenschr._, 1883, Nos.V. Winiwarter reports a
cancer of the stomach in a patient who died one year seven and a half
months after extirpation of a cancer of the nose.He regards the case
as one of multiple primary cancer.]{566} Gastric cancer often causes important secondary changes in the
coats and the lumen of the stomach.In the neighborhood of the tumor
are often found hypertrophy of the muscular coat and fibrous thickening
of the submucous coat.Polypoid hypertrophy of the mucous membrane near
the cancer is not rare.Not only near the tumor, but over the whole
stomach, chronic catarrhal gastritis usually exists.The most important alterations are those dependent upon obstruction of
the orifices of the stomach.This obstruction may be caused either by a
tumor encroaching upon the orifice or by an annular thickening of the
walls of the orifices.Even without apparent stenosis, destruction of
the muscular layer at or near the pylorus may be an obstacle to the
propulsion of the gastric contents into the duodenum.As a result of
obstruction of the pyloric orifice the stomach becomes dilated,
sometimes enormously, so as to occupy most of the abdominal cavity.The
walls of the dilated stomach, particularly the muscular coat, are
usually thickened, but exceptionally they are thinned.Sometimes with
pyloric stenosis the stomach is reduced in size.This occurs
particularly when a scirrhous growth extends diffusely from the pyloric
region over a considerable part of the stomach.Obstruction of the
cardiac orifice or in the oesophagus leads to atrophy of the stomach,
although here also there are exceptions.Above the obstruction the
oesophagus is often dilated.An existing obstruction may be reduced or
removed by ulceration or sloughing of the tumor.Both dilatation and contraction of the stomach may attend gastric
cancer without any involvement of the orifices of the stomach in the
cancerous growth.The cavity of the stomach may be so shrunken by
scirrhous thickening and contraction of the gastric walls that it will
hardly contain a hen's egg.Irregular deformities in the shape of the
stomach, such as an hour-glass shape and diverticular recesses, may be
caused by gastric cancer.Changes in the shape of the stomach and the weight of the tumor may
cause displacements of pyloric cancers, so that these tumors have been
found in nearly all regions of the abdomen, and even in the true
pelvis.[86] Such displaced cancers usually contract adhesions with
surrounding parts.[Footnote 86: Lebert, _op.It is not necessary to dwell upon the formation of adhesions which may
bind the stomach to nearly all of the abdominal organs, most frequently
to the liver, the pancreas, the intestine, and the anterior abdominal
wall.Adhesions of pyloric cancers are found in at least two-thirds of
the cases, and probably oftener.[87]

[Footnote 87: Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter found adhesions recorded in
370 out of 542 pyloric cancers.In considering the propriety of
resection of gastric cancers it has become a matter of importance to
know in what proportion of cases adhesions are present.I agree with
Ledderhose and with Rydygier in believing that adhesions are present
oftener than appears from Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's statistics.The fact that adhesions are not noted in post-mortem records of gastric
cancer cannot be considered proof of their absence.Little has been
done in the study of gastric cancer from a surgical point of view.Metastases and adhesions were absent in only 5 out of 52 cases of
pyloric cancer in which either pylorectomy or exploratory laparotomy
was performed (Rydygier).]Cancer of the stomach in the majority of cases is accompanied with
{567} metastases in other parts of the body.In 1120 cases of gastric
cancer secondary cancers were present in 710, or 63.4 per cent., and
absent in 410, or 36.6 per cent.[88] In about two-thirds of the cases,
therefore, secondary deposits were present.[Footnote 88: These cases are from Habershon, _op.i.; and Gussenbauer and Von
Winiwarter, _loc.cit._]

In order to determine the relative frequency of the secondary deposits
in various organs of the body, I have constructed the following table,
based upon an analysis of 1574 cases of cancer of the stomach in which
the situation of the metastases were given:[89]

  Lymphatic glands.551  35.0%
  Liver.475  30.2%
  Peritoneum, omentum, and intestine.357  22.7%
  Pancreas.122   7.8%
  Pleura and lung.98   6.2%
  Spleen.26   1.7%
  Brain and meninges.9   0.6%
  Other parts of the body.92   5.8%

[Footnote 89: These cases include, in addition to those cited in the
preceding foot-note, those of Dittrich (_Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.), Wrany (_ibid._, vols.Metastases in the intestine formed only
a small number of those under the heading peritoneum, omentum, and
intestine, but as they were all included together in Gussenbauer's
large statistics, the intestinal metastases could not well be placed
separately.In 673 cases the peritoneum and omentum were cancerous in
21.7 per cent.]Secondary cancerous deposits are probably even more frequent in the
lymphatic glands than appears from the table.In 1153 cases of gastric
cancer in which the situation of the affected lymphatic glands is
specified, the abdominal glands, and chiefly those near the stomach,
were the seat of cancer in 32-1/2 per cent.In Lange's 210 cases the
cervical glands were affected in 4.3 per cent.In other statistics this
percentage is much smaller.In nearly one-third of the cases there are
secondary cancers in the liver.These may attain an enormous size in
comparison with the tumor of the stomach.Cancer of the peritoneum and
of the omentum is found in about one-fifth of the cases of gastric
cancer.The spleen is rarely involved, except by continuous growth of a
cancer of the fundus or in cases of widespread distribution of cancer
through the aortic circulation.Cancer of the liver increases the
liability to metastases in the lungs, but the latter may be present
without any cancerous deposits in the liver.Secondary cancers may be
present in the suprarenal capsules, the kidneys, the ovaries, the
heart, the thoracic duct, the bones, the skin, etc.In an interesting
case reported by Finlay[90] the subcutaneous tissue of the trunk was
thickly studded with small nodules, of which two were excised during
life and found to be cylindrical epitheliomata.This led to the
diagnosis of a primary tumor of the same nature in the stomach or in
the intestine.At the autopsy was found a cylindrical epithelioma of
the stomach which had not given rise to characteristic symptoms.Secondary cancer of the intestine is rare if the deposits in the
peritoneal coat be {568} excepted.Several cancerous ulcers or multiple
cancerous nodules may be found along the intestinal tract, involving
the mucous and the submucous coats.[91] These metastases seem best
explained by the theory of implantation of cancerous elements which
have been carried from the primary growth in the stomach into the
intestine.In some of the cases the idea of multiple primary cancers
may also be entertained.Unfortunately, in Roseler's case of multiple skin-cancers with an
ulcerated cancer of the stomach no microscopical examination of the
skin-nodules was made.The interpretation of this case is therefore
doubtful (_Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.[Footnote 91: Cases in point are recorded by Wrany (_loc.cit._), Blix
(_Virchow u. Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1876, ii.207), Lange,
Katzenellenbogen, and Lebert.]It is not rare for gastric cancer to cause secondary deposits in the
stomach itself.Sometimes it is difficult to decide which of two or
more cancers in the stomach is the primary growth, as in Ripley's case
of ulcerated cancer of the cardiac orifice with a similar growth around
the pyloric orifice.[92] It is probable that in very rare instances
multiple primary cancers may develop in the stomach.[Footnote 92: J. H. Ripley, _Trans.Maurizio has also reported a case of scirrhous cancer of the cardia
with scirrhous cancer of the pylorus (_Annal.di Medicina_, Oct.,
1869).A similar case was observed by Barth (_Gaz.hebdom._, 1856, No.Cancerous metastases are produced by the transportation of cancerous
elements by the lymphatic current or by the blood-current.In a number
of instances the portal vein or some of the branches which help to form
it have been found plugged with a cancerous mass which may or may not
be organized.[93] The cancer in these cases has burst through the walls
of the vessel into the lumen, where it may grow both in the direction
and against the direction of the current.On serous surfaces, and
probably also, although rarely, on mucous surfaces, secondary cancers
may develop from cancerous particles detached from a parent tumor and
scattered over the surface as a kind of seminium.[Footnote 93: Cases of this kind have been reported with especial
fulness by Spaeth (_Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.432), Acker
(_Deutsches Arch.173), and Audibert (_De la
Generalisation du Cancer de l'Estomac_, Paris, Thesis, 1877).]Mention has already been made of the invasion of parts adjacent to the
stomach by the continuous growth of gastric cancer.In this way
lymphatic glands, the liver, the pancreas, the omenta, the transverse
colon, the spleen, the diaphragm, the anterior abdominal wall, the
vertebrae, the spinal cord and membranes, and other parts may be
involved in the cancerous growth.Under the head of Complications reference has already been made to
various lesions which may be associated with gastric cancer.As regards
the manifold complications caused by perforation of gastric cancer, in
addition to what has already been said the article on gastric ulcer may
be consulted.In general, the various fistulous communications caused
by gastric cancer are less direct than those produced by gastric ulcer.The wasting of various organs of the body in cases of gastric cancer
may be found on post-mortem examination to be extreme.Habershon
mentions a case in which the heart of a woman forty years old weighed
only 3-1/2 ounces after death from cancer of the pylorus.As in other
profoundly anaemic states, the embryonic or lymphoid alteration of the
marrow of the bones is often present in gastric cancer.PATHENOGENESIS.--The problems relating to the ultimate causation and
origin of gastric cancer belong to the pathenogenesis of cancer in
general.Our knowledge with reference to these points is purely
hypothetical.It will suffice in this connection simply to call
attention to {569} Virchow's doctrine, that cancer develops most
frequently as the result of abnormal or of physiological irritation,
hence in the stomach most frequently at the orifices; and to Cohnheim's
theory, that cancer as well as other non-infectious tumors originate in
abnormalities in development, more specifically in persistent embryonic
cells.According to the latter view, gastric cancer develops only in
those whose stomachs from the time of birth contain such embryonic
remnants.These unused embryonic cells may lie dormant throughout life
or they may be incited to cancerous growth by irritation, senile
changes, etc.According to Cohnheim's theory, the orifices of the
stomach are the most frequent seat of cancer on account of complexity
in the development of these parts.For a full consideration of these theories the reader is referred to
the section of this work on General Pathology.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of a recognizable tumor in the region of the
stomach outweighs in diagnostic value all other symptoms of gastric
cancer.The detection of fragments of cancer in the vomit or in
washings from the stomach is of equal diagnostic significance, but of
rare applicability.The discovery of secondary cancers in the liver, in
the peritoneum, or in lymphatic glands may render valuable aid in
diagnosis.Of the local gastric symptoms, coffee-ground vomiting is the
most important.The relation between the local and the general symptoms
may shed much light upon the case.While anorexia, indigestion,
vomiting, and epigastric pain and tenderness point to the existence of
a gastric affection, the malignant character of the affection may be
surmised by the development of anaemia, emaciation, and cachexia more
rapid and more profound than can be explained solely by the local
gastric symptoms.The value to be attached in the diagnosis of gastric
cancer to the absence of free hydrochloric acid from the contents of
the stomach must still be left sub judice.The age of the patient, the
duration, and the course of the disease are circumstances which are
also to be considered in making the diagnosis of gastric cancer.These
symptoms of gastric cancer have already been fully considered with
reference to their presence and absence and to their diagnostic
features.It remains to call attention to the differential diagnosis between
gastric cancer and certain diseases with which it is likely to be
confounded.The points of contrast which are to be adduced relate
mostly to the intensity and the frequency of certain symptoms.There is
not a symptom or any combination of symptoms of gastric cancer which
may not occur in other diseases.Hence the diagnosis is reached by a
balancing of probabilities, and not by any positive proof.Notwithstanding these difficulties, gastric cancer is diagnosed
correctly in the great majority of cases, although often not until a
late stage of the disease.Errors in diagnosis, however, are
unavoidable, not only in cases in which the symptoms are ambiguous or
misleading, but also in cases in which all the symptoms of gastric
cancer, including gastric hemorrhage and tumor, are present, and still
no gastric cancer exists.Cases of the latter variety are of course
rare.In the absence of tumor the diseases for which gastric cancer is most
liable to be mistaken are gastric ulcer and chronic gastric catarrh.In
the following table are given the main points of contrast between these
three diseases: {570}

{571} The diagnosis between gastric cancer and gastric ulcer is more
difficult than that between cancer and gastritis, and sometimes the
diagnosis is impossible.The differential points mentioned in the table
are of very unequal value.An age under thirty, profuse hemorrhage, and
absence of tumor are the most important points in favor of ulcer;
tumor, advanced age, and coffee-ground vomiting continued for weeks are
the most important points in favor of cancer.As cancer may have been
preceded by ulcer or chronic gastritis for years, it is evidently
unsafe to trust too much to the duration of the illness.As has already
been said, it is best to place no reliance in the differential
diagnosis upon the character of the pain.Any peculiarities of the
vomiting, the appetite, or the digestion are of little importance in
the differential diagnosis.Cachexia is of more importance, but it is
to be remembered that ulcer, and even chronic gastritis in rare
instances, may be attended by a cachexia indistinguishable from that of
cancer.Cases might be cited in which very decided temporary
improvement in the symptoms has been brought about in the course of
gastric cancer, so that too much stress should not be laid upon this
point.Enough has been said under the Symptomatology with reference to
the diagnostic bearings of the absence of free hydrochloric acid from
the stomach, of the presence of cancerous fragments in fluids from the
stomach, and of secondary cancers in different parts of the body.One must not lose sight of the fact that the whole complex of symptoms,
the order of their occurrence, and the general aspect of the case, make
an impression which cannot be conveyed in any diagnostic table, but
which leads the experienced physician to a correct diagnosis more
surely than reliance upon any single symptom.In the early part of the disease there may be danger of confounding
gastric cancer with nervous dyspepsia or with gastralgia, but with the
progress of the disease the error usually becomes apparent.What has
already been said concerning the symptomatology and the diagnosis of
gastric cancer furnishes a sufficient basis for the differential
diagnosis between this disease and nervous affections of the stomach.Chronic interstitial gastritis or fibroid induration of the stomach
cannot be distinguished with any certainty from cancer of the stomach.Fibroid induration of the stomach is of longer duration than gastric
cancer, and it is less frequently attended by severe pain and
hemorrhage.Sometimes a hard, smooth tumor presenting the contours of
the stomach can be felt, but this cannot be distinguished from diffuse
cancerous infiltration of the stomach.Non-malignant stenosis of the pylorus is of longer duration than cancer
of the pylorus.The symptoms of dilatation of the stomach are common to
both diseases.Cicatricial stenosis is the most common form of
non-malignant pyloric stenosis.This is usually preceded by symptoms of
gastric ulcer which may date back for many years.Non-malignant
stenosis more frequently occurs under forty years of age than does
cancer.The diagnosis between malignant and non-malignant stenosis of
the pylorus is in some cases impossible.Although the surest ground for the diagnosis of gastric cancer is the
appearance of tumor, there are cases in which it is difficult to decide
whether the tumor really belongs to the stomach, and even should it be
{572} established that the tumor is of the stomach, there may still be
doubt whether or not it is cancerous.The diagnosis between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors of the
stomach, such as sarcoma, fibroma, myoma, etc., hardly comes into
consideration.The latter group of tumors rarely produces symptoms
unless the tumor is so situated as to obstruct one of the orifices of
the stomach.Even in this case a positive diagnosis of the nature of
the tumor is impossible.Of greater importance is the distinction between cancerous tumors of
the stomach and tumors produced by thickening of the tissues and by
adhesions around old ulcers of the stomach.Besides the non-progressive
character of the small and usually indistinct tumors occasionally
caused by ulcers or their cicatrices, the main points in diagnosis are
the age of the patient and the existence, often for years, of symptoms
of gastric ulcer antedating the discovery of the tumor.The long
duration of symptoms of chronic catarrhal gastritis and of dilatation
of the stomach is also the main ground for distinguishing from cancer a
tumor produced by hypertrophic stenosis of the pylorus.Tumors of organs near the stomach are liable to be mistaken for cancer
of the stomach.The differential diagnosis between gastric cancer on
the one hand, and tumors of the left lobe of the liver and tumors of
the pancreas on the other hand, is often one of great difficulty.Tumors of the liver are generally depressed by inspiration, whereas
tumors of the stomach are much less frequently affected by the
respiratory movements.The percussion note over tumors of the liver is
flat, while a tympanitic quality is usually associated with the dulness
over tumors of the stomach.Light percussion will often bring out a
zone of tympanitic resonance between the hepatic flatness and the
dulness of gastric tumors.Gastric tumors are usually more movable than
hepatic tumors.By palpation the lower border of the liver can perhaps
be felt and separated from the tumor in case this belongs to the
stomach.Most of the points of distinction based upon these physical
signs fail in cases in which a gastric cancer becomes firmly adherent
to the liver.The basis for a diagnosis must then be sought in the
presence or the absence of marked disturbance of the gastric functions,
particularly of haematemesis, vomiting, and dilatation of the stomach.On the other hand, ascites and persistent jaundice would speak in favor
of hepatic cancer.There are cases in which the diagnosis between
hepatic cancer and gastric cancer cannot be made.This is especially
true of tumors of the left lobe of the liver, which grow down over the
stomach and compress it, and which are accompanied by marked
derangement of the gastric functions.The frequency with which cancer
of the stomach is associated with secondary cancer of the liver should
be borne in mind in considering the diagnosis.There are certain symptoms which in many cases justify a probable
diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas, but this disease can rarely be
distinguished with any certainty from cancer of the stomach.The
situation of the tumor is the same in both diseases.With pancreatic
cancer the pain is less influenced by taking food, the vomiting is less
prominent as a symptom, and anorexia, haematemesis, and dilatation of
the stomach are less common than with gastric cancer.Of the positive
symptoms in {573} favor of cancer of the pancreas, the most important
are jaundice, fatty stools, and sugar in the urine.Of these symptoms
jaundice is the most common.Should there be any suspicion that the tumor is caused by impaction of
feces, a positive opinion should be withheld until laxatives have been
given.Mistakes may occur as to the diagnosis between gastric cancer and
tumors of the omenta, the mesentery, the transverse colon, the
lymphatic glands, and even the spleen or the kidney.Encapsulated
peritoneal exudations near the stomach have been mistaken for gastric
cancer.Where a mistake is likely to occur each individual case
presents its own peculiarities, which it is impossible to deal with in
a general way.Of the utmost importance is a careful physical
exploration of the characters and relations of the tumor, aided, if
necessary, by artificial distension of the stomach or of the colon by
gas (see page 549).No less important is the attentive observance of
the symptoms of each case.In doubtful cases fluids withdrawn from the
stomach by the stomach-tube should be carefully examined for cancerous
fragments, and the gastric fluids may be tested for free hydrochloric
acid by methods already described.Pyloric cancers which receive a marked pulsation from the aorta
sometimes raise a suspicion of aneurism, but the differential diagnosis
is not usually one of great difficulty.Gastric cancer when it presses
upon the aorta may simulate aneurism, not only by the presence of
pulsation, but also by the existence of a bruit over the tumor.The
tumor produced by aneurism is generally smoother and rounder than that
caused by cancer.The pulsation of an aneurism is expansile, but the
impulse of a tumor resting upon an artery is lifting and generally
without lateral expansion.The impulse transmitted to a tumor resting
upon the abdominal aorta may be lessened by placing the patient upon
his hands and knees.Sometimes the tumor can be moved with the hands
off from the artery, so that the pulsation momentarily ceases.A severe
boring pain in the back, shooting down into the loins and the lower
extremities, and not dependent upon the condition of the stomach,
characterizes abdominal aneurism, but is not to be expected in gastric
cancer.With aneurism gastric disorders and constitutional disturbance
are much less prominent than with cancer of the stomach.[94]

[Footnote 94: In a case of pulsating pyloric cancer observed by Bierner
the symptoms were much more in favor of aneurism than of cancer.The
cancer had extended to the retro-peritoneal glands, which partially
surrounded and compressed the aorta.There were marked lateral
pulsation of the tumor, distinct systolic bruit, diminution of the
femoral pulse, and severe lancinating pain in the back and sacral
region.With the exception of vomiting, the gastric symptoms were
insignificant.The patient was only thirty-three years old (Ott, _Zur
Path.des Magencarcinoms_, Zurich, 1867, p.Spasm of the upper part of the rectus abdominis muscle may simulate a
tumor in the epigastric region.The diagnosis is made by noting the
correspondence in shape and position between the tumor and a division
of the rectus muscle, the superficial character of the tumor, the
effect of different positions of the body upon the distinctness of the
tumor, the tympanitic resonance over the tumor, and, should there still
be any doubt, by anaesthetizing the patient, when the phantom tumor
will disappear.Spasm of the rectus muscle has been observed in cases
of cancer of the stomach.{574} Attention is also called to the possibility of mistaking in
emaciated persons the head of the normal pancreas, or less frequently
the mesentery and lymphatic glands, for a tumor.[95] As emaciation
progresses the at first doubtful tumor may even appear to increase in
size and distinctness.[Footnote 95: In the case of the late Comte de Chambord the diagnosis
of gastric cancer was made upon what appeared to be very good grounds.No cancer, however, existed, and the ill-defined tumor which was felt
during life in the epigastric region proved to be the mesentery
containing considerable fat (Vulpian, "La derniere Maladie de M. le
Comte de Chambord."It is sufficient to call attention to the danger of mistaking, in cases
where the gastric symptoms are not prominent and no tumor exists,
gastric cancer for pernicious anaemia, senile marasmus, or the chronic
phthisis of old age.In some of these cases the diagnosis is
impossible, but the physician should bear in mind the possibility of
gastric cancer in the class of cases here considered, and should search
carefully for a tumor or other symptom which may aid in the diagnosis.The possibility of mistaking gastric cancer accompanied with peritoneal
exudation for cirrhosis of the liver or for tubercular peritonitis is
also to be borne in mind.The diagnosis of the position of the cancer in the stomach can usually
be made in cases of cancer of the cardia or of the pylorus.The
symptoms diagnostic of cancer of the cardia are dysphagia,
regurgitation of food, obstruction in the passage of the oesophageal
bougie, and sinking in of the epigastric region in consequence of
atrophy of the stomach.It has already been said that catheterization
of the oesophagus does not always afford the evidence of obstruction
which one would expect.Cancerous stenosis of the cardia is to be
distinguished from cicatricial stenosis in this situation.The
diagnosis is based upon the history of the case, which is generally
decisive, and upon finding fragments of cancer in the tube passed down
the oesophagus.That the cancer is seated at the pylorus is made evident by the
situation of the tumor (see p.561) and by the existence of dilatation
of the stomach.There are many more causes of stenosis of the pylorus
than of stenosis of the cardia, so that, notwithstanding the absence of
tumor, cancer of the cardia is often more readily diagnosticated than
cancer of the pylorus.The greatest difficulty in diagnosis is presented by cancers which do
not obstruct the orifices of the stomach.Many of these cancers run an
almost latent course so far as the gastric symptoms are concerned, and
in case they produce no recognizable tumor and are unattended with
hemorrhage, the difficulties in their diagnosis are almost
insurmountable.In general, a diagnosis of the particular form of cancer which is
present cannot be made, nor is such a diagnosis of any practical value.In very exceptional cases such a diagnosis might be made by the
examination of secondary subcutaneous cancers[96] or of fragments found
in the fluids obtained from the stomach.[Footnote 96: As for example, in Finlay's case, already referred to (p.It is not safe to trust implicitly in this criterion, as the
subcutaneous tumors may be of a different nature from the tumor of the
stomach, as in an interesting case observed by Leube (_op.Although the diagnosis of gastric cancer can generally be made before
the death of the patient, unfortunately a positive diagnosis in the
early stages of the disease is usually impossible.Should resection of
cancer {575} of the stomach become a legitimate operation in surgery,
it will be of the utmost importance to make the diagnosis in an early
stage of the disease.Only those cases are suitable for resection in
which there are no secondary deposits, the general health of the
patient is in fair condition, and extensive adhesions have not been
formed.It was to be hoped that the ingenious instrument devised by
Mikulicz for exploring the interior of the stomach by electrical
illumination would prove a valuable aid in diagnosis.The gastroscope
in its present construction, however, has proved of little value.[97]
It is, moreover, difficult to manipulate, and is not free from danger
to the patient.We may be permitted, however, to hope for improvement
in this direction.[Footnote 97: Mikulicz has observed with the gastroscope in a case of
pyloric cancer immobility of the pylorus and absence of rugae in the
mucous membrane of the pyloric region (_Wiener med.Wochenschr._, 1883,
No.It does not seem probable that there can be anything peculiar
to cancer in these appearances.]In cases in which there is reasonable suspicion of the existence of
gastric cancer, and in which there is proper ground to contemplate
resection of the tumor, it is justifiable to make an exploratory
incision into the abdomen.It can then be decided whether or not cancer
exists, and whether the case is suitable for operation.When this
incision is made with all of the precautions known to modern surgery,
it is attended with little or no danger,[98] and it should not be made
except by surgeons who are practically familiar with these precautions.[Footnote 98: Of 20 exploratory incisions for tumor of the stomach
performed by Billroth, not one had ended fatally (_Deutsche med.Wochenschrift_, 1882, ii.).]PROGNOSIS.--There is no proof that cancer of the stomach has ever ended
in recovery.It may be admitted that partial cicatrization of gastric
cancer may occur.We have, however, no sufficient reason to believe
that cancer of the stomach has ever been completely destroyed by any
process of nature or by any medicinal treatment.A successful resection of a cancer of the pylorus by Billroth in
January, 1881, made a great sensation in the medical world.Since that
time the operation has been performed successfully ten times, and with
fatal issue twenty-seven times.A radical cure has not, however, been
effected, although life has been prolonged for a year and a half after
the operation.[99] The possibility of permanent cure of gastric cancer
by extirpation must be admitted.Enthusiasm over this possibility,
however, is seriously lessened by the fact that a radical cure is not
to be expected unless the operation is undertaken when the tumor is of
small size, has produced no distant metastases, is free from many
adhesions, and the patient is not greatly prostrated.In view of the
difficulty of diagnosis in the early stages it is not likely that these
favorable conditions can be fulfilled except in the rarest instances.Metastases may already exist when the tumor is small and before it has
given rise to any symptoms.[100] Pylorectomy, moreover, will probably
be successful in the hands of only comparatively few surgeons.It is
therefore but a feeble glimmer of hope {576} which is now admitted to
the hitherto relentlessly fatal forecast of this disease.[Footnote 99: Several of the patients are still living (1884), but, so
far as I can learn, no patient has survived the operation more than a
year and a half.][Footnote 100: Birch-Hirschfeld relates a case in which a non-ulcerated
cancerous tumor not larger than a silver half-dollar was found in the
pyloric region of the stomach of a woman who died from injury.The
tumor had given rise to no symptoms.Nevertheless, numerous metastases
existed in the lymphatic glands of the omentum and of the lesser
curvature (_Jahresb.d. gesellschaft f. Natur u. Heilk.im Dresden_
[1882-83], 1883, p.TREATMENT.--Even up to the present time various drugs have been vaunted
as effecting a radical cure of cancer of the stomach.Some of these,
such as mercury, are positively harmful; others, such as conium,
belladonna, and condurango, are often palliative; but not one has been
proven to be curative.Since its recommendation by Friedreich in 1874,
condurango has enjoyed the greatest vogue.The few observations in
which, under the use of this agent, tumors, real or apparent, of the
stomach have lessened in size or disappeared, admit of other
interpretations than as cures of gastric cancer.There is, however,
considerable testimony as to the virtues of condurango as a stomachic.In some cases it relieves the pain, vomiting, and indigestion of
gastric cancer, but in many cases it is employed without benefit.The
drug which passes by the name of condurango in the market is a very
variable preparation.According to Friedreich's directions, decoction
of condurango is prepared as follows: Macerate oz.condurango for twelve hours with fluidounce xij of water; then boil
down to fluidounce vj and strain.The dose is a tablespoonful two or
three times daily.The decoction of condurango may be combined with
syr.While all specific treatment of gastric cancer is to be abandoned, much
can be done for the relief and comfort of the patient.In general, the indications are similar to those in gastric ulcer.It
is not necessary, however, to restrict the diet to the same extent as
in gastric ulcer.The patient's tastes may be consulted to a
considerable extent.Still, it will be found, as a rule, that the
patient is most comfortable when his diet is confined to
easily-digestible substances, such as milk, beef-juice, Leube's
beef-solution, rare beefsteak, and other articles mentioned under the
treatment of gastric ulcer.The pain of gastric cancer will usually require the administration of
opium in some form.There is manifestly not the same objection to the
employment of narcotics in a necessarily fatal disease like cancer as
in ulcer of the stomach.Opium may be given in pill form or as the
tincture or deodorized tincture, or often most advantageously as
hypodermic injections of morphia, to which atropia may be added.Vomiting is sometimes controlled by regulation of the diet,
particularly by iced milk.For this symptom also opium or morphia is
often necessary.In addition, the customary remedies for relief of
vomiting, such as bits of ice, iced champagne, soda-water, hydrocyanic
acid, oxalate of cerium, creasote, may be tried.Cold or hot
applications to the abdomen and mild counter-irritants, such as mustard
plaster or turpentine stupes, sometimes afford relief.If the vomiting
be incoercible, it may be well to administer food for a short time
exclusively by the rectum, and in case of stenosing cancer of the
cardia this method of administering food may be the only one possible.Acid eructations and heartburn are often relieved by the antacids, as
bicarbonate of sodium, lime-water, or calcined magnesia.Against
fermentative processes in the stomach have been recommended salicylate
of sodium, creasote, carbolic acid, and the alkaline hyposulphites.Charcoal tablets are as useful as, and less likely to disagree than,
other antifermentatives.{577} In view of V. d. Velden's
investigations, already mentioned, the administration of dilute
hydrochloric acid in an hour after a meal is indicated.Excellent results have been obtained by regularly washing out the
stomach in cases of gastric cancer, particularly in pyloric cancer with
dilatation of the stomach.By this procedure pain, indigestion, and
vomiting are often greatly relieved, and the patient experiences a
renewed sense of well-being.Unfortunately, the benefit is only
temporary.The syphon process is most conveniently employed.Contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube are copious
gastrorrhagia and great weakness of the patient.When constipation is not relieved by washing out the stomach, enemata
should be employed.Drastic purgatives should not be given.For diarrhoea opium may be given, particularly in the form of small
enemata of starch and laudanum.Scanty hemorrhage in the form of coffee-grounds vomiting requires no
treatment.Copious haematemesis is to be treated according to the
principles laid down under the treatment of hemorrhage from gastric
ulcer.Discussion of the surgical treatment of gastric cancer of course does
not belong to this work.The opinion entertained by the physician as to
the propriety of surgical interference in gastric cancer is not,
however, a matter of indifference, for cases of gastric cancer come
first into the hands of the physician, and generally only by his
recommendation into those of the surgeon.So long as the physician
stands absolutely powerless before this disease, his general attitude
as to the propriety of surgical interference should not be one of
hostility.Experience only can determine the justification of surgical
operation in cases of gastric cancer.As yet, it is too soon to express
a positive opinion as to the value of resection of gastric cancer.Of
37 published resections of cancer of the pylorus, 27 died from the
effects of the operation, and of the fatal cases 18 within the first
twenty-four hours.These results are certainly not calculated to awaken
much enthusiasm for the operation.Still, it would be wrong to draw
definite conclusions from the existing statistics of resection of the
cancerous pylorus, partly because the number of operations is as yet
too small, partly because the operation has been done when it was
certainly unwarrantable according to the best judges (Billroth,
Czerny), and chiefly because the number of operators in proportion to
the number of operations is too great.For the 37 published operations
there have been 27 operators.Ovariotomy was not considered a
justifiable operation until the excellent results of individual
operators were obtained.It is probable that to an even greater extent
resection of the pylorus will become the specialty of certain
operators.Therefore, before concluding as to the value of resection of
cancer of the stomach it is necessary to await the results of
individual surgeons in a series of cases.[101]

[Footnote 101: Already, from this point of view, the operation appears
more hopeful.Czerny has performed 6 resections of the stomach with
only 2 fatal results; 4 of the operations were pylorectomies for
cancer.Billroth has performed the operation 8 times with 3 fatal
results (_Wiener med.Wochenschrift_, 1884, Nos.So much, however, is now certain, that with our present means of
diagnosis the number of cases suitable for extirpation is very
small.[102] A {578} radical cure is to be expected only in the rarest
instances, so that the value of the operation will depend chiefly upon
the condition of the patient after its performance.As regards this
point, the results in the successful cases have been encouraging.In
several instances the terrible sufferings of the patient have given
place to months of comparative health and comfort.[Footnote 102: Billroth at the eleventh session of the Congress of
German Surgeons said that he was amazed at the number of resections of
the pylorus which had been performed.Out of 50 to 60 cases of gastric
cancer, only 1 appeared to him suitable for operation.]In cases of extreme cancerous stenosis of the pylorus which are not
suitable for resection Wolfler proposed forming a fistulous
communication between the stomach and the small intestine
(gastro-enterostomy).The results of the operation have not been
encouraging.Out of six cases in which this operation has been
performed, only two patients lived after the operation.For the same condition Schede proposed making a duodenal fistula
(duodenostomy), but I am not aware that the operation has been
performed.The results of gastrostomy for relief of cancerous stenosis of the
cardia or of the oesophagus have not been encouraging.[103]

[Footnote 103: Of 76 cases of gastrostomy for the relief of cancer of
the oesophagus or of the cardia, only 14 lived over thirty days
(Leisrink and Alsberg, _Arch.Non-Cancerous Tumors of the Stomach.Little clinical interest attaches to non-cancerous tumors of the
stomach.They are comparatively rare and usually unattended by
symptoms.Even should a tumor be discovered, there are no means of
determining the nature of the tumor; and if symptoms are produced by
the tumor, the case will probably be diagnosticated as one of cancer.It is necessary, therefore, in the present work to do little more than
enumerate the different forms of non-cancerous tumor of the stomach.The most common of benign gastric tumors are polypi projecting into the
interior of the stomach.These are usually so-called mucous or
adenomatous polypi, being composed of hypertrophied or hyperplastic
elements of the mucous membrane with or without new growth of submucous
tissue.They may be present in large number (one hundred and fifty to
two hundred in a case of Leudet's).Their development is usually
attributed to a chronic catarrhal gastritis, so that a gastritis
polypora has been distinguished.These polyps are important only when
they obstruct one of the orifices of the stomach, in which case they
may cause even fatal stenosis.Benign adenomata appear less frequently as growths in the submucous
coat of the stomach (Winiwarter).Myomata and myosarcomata, projecting sometimes as polyps either into
the gastric or the peritoneal cavity, may attain a very large size, as
in a case reported by Brodowski in which a cystic myosarcoma of the
stomach weighed twelve pounds.[104]

[Footnote 104: _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Sarcoma, either as a primary or a secondary tumor of the stomach, is
rare.Two cases of secondary lympho-sarcoma of the stomach (primary of
the retro-peritoneal glands) without gastric symptoms have come under
my observation.In a similar case reported by Coupland the symptoms
resembled those of gastric cancer.[105]

[Footnote 105: _Trans.{579} In connection with gastric ulcer mention has already been made of
the occurrence of miliary aneurisms in the stomach, which may be the
cause of fatal haematemesis.Sometimes the mucous membrane is studded with little cysts, as in a
case reported by Harris.[106]

[Footnote 106: _Am.Fibromata and lipomata are very rare.Foreign bodies in the stomach, particularly balls of hair, have been
sometimes mistaken for tumors, particularly cancer, of this organ.Schonborn removed successfully a ball of hair from the stomach by
gastrotomy.[107] Before the operation the tumor was considered to be a
movable kidney.{580}

HEMORRHAGE FROM THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.Hemorrhage from the stomach is a symptom, and not a disease.It is a
result of a great variety of morbid conditions in the description of
which it receives more or less consideration.Already the
symptomatology and treatment of hemorrhage from the stomach have been
considered in connection with its two most important causes--namely,
gastric ulcer and gastric cancer.It remains to give a summary of the
etiology and diagnosis of gastric hemorrhage.Hemorrhage from the stomach is also called gastrorrhagia.The term
haematemesis is not synonymous with gastric hemorrhage, for blood may
be vomited which has simply been swallowed or has passed from the
intestine into the stomach.ETIOLOGY.--The causes of gastric hemorrhage are as follows:

1.Ulcer of the Stomach.--Simple gastric ulcer is the most frequent
cause of abundant hemorrhage from the stomach.Tuberculous gastric
ulcers, typhoid gastric ulcers, and the ulcers of phlegmonous gastritis
are extremely rare causes of hemorrhage.Hemorrhagic erosion of the
stomach, which by many writers is assigned an important place in the
etiology of gastric hemorrhage, is not an independent affection, and in
my opinion is without any clinical significance.Cancer of the Stomach.--(Non-cancerous tumors of the stomach hardly
deserve mention in this connection, so infrequently are they the cause
of gastric hemorrhage.)Traumatism (mechanical, chemical, thermic).--_a_.Acting from
without the stomach: severe injury to the abdomen, as by a blow or a
fall; penetrating wounds of the stomach.Acting from within the stomach: foreign bodies, particularly
sharp-pointed ones; corrosive poisons, as acids and alkalies; other
toxic inflammatory irritants; and very hot substances.Here should also
be mentioned injury from an inflexible stomach-tube and aspiration of
mucous membrane with the stomach-pump.Diseases of the Gastric Blood-vessels.--_a_.Aneurism of the
arteries of the stomach.Miliary aneurisms have been found by Galliard
and others as a cause of profuse and even fatal hemorrhage from the
stomach.Especially in obscure cases should careful search be made for
miliary aneurisms.Varices of the veins are a not unimportant cause of gastric
hemorrhage.They are most frequently associated with chronic passive
{581} congestion of the stomach, but they may be found without any
apparent disturbance of the circulation.Degenerations of the vessels, particularly fatty and atheromatous
degeneration of the arteries.Probably gastric hemorrhage in
phosphorus-poisoning is to be attributed to fatty degeneration of the
arteries.Amyloid degeneration of the blood-vessels is a doubtful cause
of hemorrhage.Active Congestion of the Stomach.--Here is usually placed gastric
hemorrhage as a result of severe inflammation of the stomach (as acute
catarrhal gastritis), although in these cases the inflammatory
alteration of the vascular walls is an equally important factor.With more probability the so-called vicarious hemorrhages from the
stomach are to be assigned to active congestion.Sceptical as one is
inclined to be as regards vicarious hemorrhages of the menses, the
occurrence of such hemorrhages, although rare, must be admitted.Doubtful, however, are alleged cases of gastric hemorrhage taking the
place of suppressed hemorrhoidal bleeding or of epistaxis.Passive Congestion of the Stomach.--This embraces an important group
of causes of gastric hemorrhage.This hemorrhage is the result of
venous congestion caused by some obstruction to the portal circulation.The obstruction may be--

_a_.In the portal vein itself or its branches within the liver, as in
pylethrombosis, cirrhosis of the liver, tumors, such as cancer or
echinococcus cysts, compressing the portal vein, occlusion of
capillaries in the liver by pigment-deposits in melanaemia, and
dilatation of the bile-ducts in the liver from obstruction to the flow
of bile.Next to ulcer and to cancer of the stomach, cirrhosis of the
liver is the most frequent and important cause of gastrorrhagia.In the pulmonary blood-vessels, as in pulmonary emphysema, chronic
pleurisy, and fibroid induration of the lungs.In the heart in consequence of uncompensated valvular and other
diseases of the heart.For evident reasons, obstruction of the pulmonary or of the cardiac
circulation is much less likely to cause gastric hemorrhage than is
obstruction in the portal vein or the liver.Possibly, gastric hemorrhage which is caused by violent acts of
vomiting may be caused by venous congestion of the mucous membrane of
the stomach.In support of this view, Rindfleisch advances the idea
that the veins in the muscular layers of the stomach, in consequence of
the thinness of their coats, are much more likely than the arteries to
suffer from the compression of the muscle during its contraction.The occasional occurrence of gastric hemorrhage during pregnancy has
also been attributed to passive congestion of the stomach.Acute Infectious Diseases--namely, yellow fever, acute yellow
atrophy of the liver, relapsing fever; less frequently cholera, typhoid
fever, typhus fever, diphtheria, erysipelas, and the exanthematous
fevers, small-pox, measles, and scarlet fever.The cause of gastric hemorrhage in these diseases is not understood.The usual explanation attributes the hemorrhage to dissolution of the
blood-corpuscles and secondary alteration of the walls of the
blood-vessels.Plugging of the vessels with micro-organisms has been
found {582} in only a few instances.The gastrorrhagia of acute yellow
atrophy of the liver has been attributed to dissolution of the blood,
not only by some infectious agent, but also by constituents of the
bile, and also to obstruction of the portal circulation by destruction
and occlusion of capillaries in the liver.Hemorrhagic
diatheses--namely, scorbutus, purpura, and haematophilia.Strictly
speaking, a hemorrhagic diathesis exists in other affections of this
class.Here we may distinguish, first, periodical malarial
hemorrhages from the stomach which are cured by quinia; second,
pernicious gastric malarial fever, of very grave prognosis; and third,
hemorrhages in malarial cachexia due to extreme anaemia.Cases which
have been described as malaria with scorbutic complications belong
mostly to the last variety.Mention has already been made of gastric
hemorrhages attributed to malarial pigmentation of the liver.The most important affections in this category
are progressive pernicious anaemia, leucocythaemia, and
pseudo-leucocythaemia, including the so-called splenic anaemia.The hemorrhage is attributed to dissolution of the
blood-corpuscles by the action of the biliary salts.Gastric hemorrhage is a rare event in Bright's disease, occurring more
especially with small kidneys.In one such case I found that the fatal
hemorrhage was due to the bursting of a miliary aneurism of a small
artery in the submucous coat.Probably in all similar cases the
hemorrhage is referable to disease of the vascular walls.Neuropathic Conditions.--Although ecchymoses in the mucous membrane
of the stomach can be experimentally produced by injury of various
parts of the brain and spinal cord, there is no proof that gastric
hemorrhage which is of any clinical importance is referable to
structural diseases of the nervous system.The occasional occurrence of
gastric hemorrhage in progressive paralysis of the insane, in
tuberculous meningitis, in epilepsy, is to be attributed to other
causes.In lack of a better explanation, however, the gastric hemorrhages which
have been occasionally observed in hysterical women may be classified
here.These constitute not the least important class of gastric
hemorrhages.The hemorrhages from the stomach in chlorosis belong
partly here and partly to anaemia.Melaena Neonatorum.--Although in some cases ulcers have been found
in the stomach or duodenum, and in others a general hemorrhagic
diathesis exists, it must be said that the etiology of this grave
disease is still very obscure.Bursting of Aneurisms or of Abscesses from without into the
Stomach.Idiopathic Causes.--Under this unsatisfactory designation are
included cases which are aptly described by Flint[1] in the following
words: "Hemorrhage sometimes occurs from the stomach, as from the
bronchial tubes, the Schneiderian membrane, and in other situations,
without any apparent pathological connections, neither following nor
preceding any appreciable morbid conditions.It is then to be
considered {583} as idiopathic."A person in apparent health has
suddenly a hemorrhage, often profuse, from the stomach, which is
followed only by symptoms immediately referable to the hemorrhage.The
hemorrhage is naturally the source of great anxiety.Ulcer or cancer of
the stomach or some other grave disease is usually suspected.But the
patient develops no further symptoms, and often never has another
hemorrhage.Whatever hypotheses one may construct for these cases of
so-called idiopathic hemorrhage, the recognition of the clinical fact
of their occurrence is important.[Footnote 1: Austin Flint, _A Treatise on the Principles and Practice
of Medicine_, 5th ed., p.Inasmuch as hemorrhage from the stomach is usually made manifest by the
vomiting of blood, it is important to bear in mind that gastric
hemorrhage is not the only cause of haematemesis.Blood may gain access
to the stomach by being swallowed in cases of hemorrhages from the
nose, mouth, throat, bronchi, lungs, and oesophagus.Blood may also
enter the stomach from the duodenum in cases of simple ulcer of the
duodenum or of typhoid ulcers situated in the upper part of the
intestine.The SYMPTOMS of hemorrhage from the stomach have already been described
in connection with ULCER OF THE STOMACH.MORBID ANATOMY.--As is evident from the enumeration of the causes of
gastric hemorrhage, the lesions found after death are manifold.A
description of these lesions, however, does not belong here.It is
necessary, however, to say a few words concerning the demonstration of
the source of the hemorrhage.The hemorrhage is arterial, venous, or capillary in origin.Ulcerations
from the stomach into the heart, which have been mentioned in
connection with gastric ulcer, are too infrequent to come into
consideration in this connection.If the bleeding is from a large
artery or vein or from a medium-sized aneurism or varix, the
demonstration of its source is not difficult.Often, however, in cases
of fatal gastric hemorrhage the search for the source of the hemorrhage
has proved fruitless.It is supposed that in many such cases the
hemorrhage is due to diapedesis, and not to rupture of a blood-vessel
(rhexis).Doubtless, small gastric hemorrhages, particularly those into
the tissues of the stomach, are often the result of diapedesis, but in
cases of profuse hemorrhages from the stomach where the source of the
hemorrhage is not demonstrable after death, the convenient assumption
of hemorrhage by diapedesis, in my opinion, plays too important a role.In most cases of profuse gastrorrhagia the symptoms point to a sudden
outpouring of blood into the stomach; and our knowledge of diapedesis
does not warrant the belief that the red blood-corpuscles can escape
through the unsuffused walls of the vessels with that combined rapidity
and abundance which would be necessary to explain the sudden and
profuse hemorrhage.In these cases hemorrhage by rhexis is altogether
more probable even when ruptured vessels cannot be demonstrated.It
often requires a long-continued and careful search to find a small
vessel which is ruptured.In the case above mentioned of fatal
haematemesis from miliary aneurism over an hour of continuous searching
was required to find the pinhole perforation in the mucous membrane in
the bottom of which lay the small aneurism.Chiari[2] has reported a
fatal gastric hemorrhage due to rupture of a submucous vein.The
erosion of the mucous membrane was not larger than a hempseed.The
examination of the mucous membrane is often much impeded by the {584}
closely-adherent mucus and blood, which have to be carefully removed.Injection of the vessels of the stomach with fluid may aid in finding a
ruptured vessel.It is not intended to assert that in all cases of
fatal gastric hemorrhage a painstaking search would reveal the source
of the hemorrhage, but it is believed that cases of fatal gastric
hemorrhage would less frequently be reported with negative anatomical
result as hemorrhages by diapedesis, or by exhalation, or as
parenchymatous or capillary hemorrhages, if such a search were made.Wochenschr._, 1882, No.DIAGNOSIS.--Undoubtedly, small hemorrhages into the stomach often occur
which are not recognized, and in the absence of vomiting even larger
hemorrhages may escape detection unless a careful examination of the
stools be made.The patient may die from abundant gastric hemorrhage
before any blood has been vomited or has passed by the bowels.When there is doubt whether the black color of the stools is due to
blood or to the administration of iron or of bismuth, it generally
suffices to add water to the stools.If blood be present, the water
will acquire a reddish color.Should doubt still remain, then the
microscope, the spectroscope, or the test for haemin crystals may be
called into requisition (see p.Whether black, tarry stools are produced by hemorrhage from the stomach
or by hemorrhage in the upper part of the intestine can be decided only
by the clinical history.If haematemesis be likewise present, the
presumption is strongly in favor of gastric hemorrhage.The diagnosis,
however, between hemorrhage from duodenal ulcer and that from gastric
ulcer is very difficult, and can rarely be positively made.The mere inspection of the vomit is generally sufficient to determine
whether it contain blood or not.Color more or less resembling that of
altered blood may be produced in the vomit by iron, bismuth, red wine,
various fruits, such as cranberries, and by bile.When a careful
inspection by the physician leaves doubt as to the presence of
blood--which will rarely be the case--then here also recourse may be
had to the microscope, spectroscope, and test for haemin crystals.Sometimes blood is swallowed and then vomited by hysterical females or
by malingering soldiers or prisoners for purpose of deceit.In such
cases there are generally no evidences of acute anaemia or of gastric
disease.The blood of some animals can be distinguished by the
microscope from human blood.When suspicion of deceit exists, there are
generally various ways of entrapping the patient.When blood is vomited by nursing infants the possibility of its coming
from the breast of the mother is to be thought of.Sometimes blood from the nose or throat is swallowed, particularly when
the bleeding occurs during the night.This blood may subsequently be
vomited.The inspection of the nose or throat will generally reveal the
source of the hemorrhage in such cases.The diagnosis between hemorrhage from the oesophagus and that from the
stomach must be based upon the clinical history.The oesophagoscope,
however, has been successfully employed for diagnostic purposes.Several cases have been reported of fatal hemorrhage from varices of
the oesophagus.Such hemorrhage cannot be distinguished from gastric
hemorrhage.Much more frequently arises the question whether the hemorrhage is from
the stomach or from the lungs.Sometimes the decision of this point
{585} is very difficult, and it may even be impossible, especially when
the physician is obliged to trust only to the statements of the patient
or his friends.Difficulty in the diagnosis results mainly from the
fact that coughing and vomiting of blood are often associated with each
other.With haemoptysis blood may be swallowed and then vomited, and
with haematemesis more or less coughing occurs.The diagnosis is to be
based upon the points contained in the following table:

As it is important that the patient should be as quiet as possible
during and for some time after the hemorrhage, any physical examination
which disturbs the patient, such as percussing the posterior part of
the chest or palpating the abdomen, should be avoided.The diagnosis of the many causes of gastric hemorrhage belongs to the
description of the various diseases which have been enumerated under
the etiology.PROGNOSIS.--It is exceptional for gastric hemorrhage to prove
immediately fatal.According to Fox, such an occurrence is more
frequent with cirrhosis of the liver than with ulcer or cancer of the
stomach.The ultimate result of the hemorrhage depends greatly upon the
previous condition of the patient.If this condition was good, he often
rallies from the most desperate prostration immediately following the
hemorrhage.A previously enfeebled patient is of course more likely to
yield to the further anaemia and exhaustion caused by profuse
hemorrhage.Although the symptoms of gastric ulcer and of cirrhosis of
the liver are sometimes improved after hemorrhage from the stomach,
nevertheless this hemorrhage can never be regarded as a welcome event.For the treatment of gastric hemorrhage see ULCER OF THE STOMACH.{586}

DILATATION OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--By dilatation of the stomach is understood a condition in
which the stomach is abnormally large and is unequal to the performance
of its normal functions.It will be observed that this definition of
dilatation of the stomach includes an anatomical disturbance and a
physiological disturbance.A stomach which, although unusually large,
performs its functions perfectly well is not, in the clinical sense, a
dilated stomach.The most characteristic functional disturbance in
dilatation of the stomach is delay in the propulsion of the gastric
contents into the intestine in consequence of inability of the muscular
coat of the stomach to perform the work imposed upon it.This muscular
insufficiency, whether primary or secondary, necessarily involves
disorder of the digestive and absorptive powers of the stomach.SYNONYMS.--Dilatatio ventriculi; Gastrectasia.It has been proposed to
call the early stages of the disease insufficiency of the stomach
(Rosenbach).The condition described by Chomel as dyspepsia of liquids
is undoubtedly dilatation of the stomach.HISTORY.--Dilatation as a disease of the stomach is not mentioned by
writers of antiquity.Fabricius ab Aquapendente in 1623 was among the
first to record an observation of dilatation of the stomach.During the
following century cases of dilatation of the stomach were recorded more
as curiosities than as of clinical interest.Most cases were attributed
to eating or drinking inordinate quantities.In 1743, Widman clearly
recognized stenosis of the pylorus as a cause of gastric dilatation.In
the works of Van Swieten, Morgagni, Lieutaud, and J. P. Frank, during
the latter half of the last century, different causes of dilatation of
the stomach are recognized.The last writer especially distinguishes
clearly between dilatation due to stenosis and that due to atony.The
data as to the symptoms of the disease were still very imperfect.In
1833, Duplay[1] published an important article in which the main points
in the causation and symptomatology of dilatation of the stomach are
clearly described.After this time the important works on the practice
of medicine or on diseases of the stomach contain, in the main, correct
descriptions of the disease under consideration.Since the publication
in 1869 of Kussmaul's memorable article[2] on the treatment of
dilatation of the stomach by the {587} stomach-pump, much greater
attention has been paid to this disease than ever before, so that the
literature upon this subject during the last fifteen years is very
considerable.In 1875, Penzoldt published an excellent monograph upon
dilatation of the stomach.[3]

[Footnote 1: _Arch.[Footnote 2: _Deutsches Arch.Kussmaul
first employed the stomach-pump in dilatation of the stomach in 1867,
and in that year he reported a successful result (_Schmidt's Jahrb._,
Bd.[Footnote 3: _Die Magenerweiterung_, Erlangen, 1875.To this work I am
indebted for most of the historical data in the text.]ETIOLOGY.--Dilatation of the stomach is the result of inability of this
organ to propel its contents into the intestine within the normal space
of time.In the performance of this mechanical work three factors are
involved--namely, the muscular force of the stomach, the quantity and
quality of the gastric contents, and the size of the opening between
the stomach and the intestine.All causes of dilatation of the stomach
may be referred to abnormalities of one or more of these factors.The most important group of causes is represented by stenosis of the
pyloric orifice or of the adjacent part of the stomach or of the
intestine.[4] Most cases of hypertrophic dilatation of the
stomach--that is, dilatation with hypertrophy of the muscular walls of
the stomach--are produced by causes belonging to this group.[Footnote 4: Dilatation of the stomach in consequence of intestinal
obstruction below the duodenum is so rare that no further attention is
given to the subject in the present article.The term pyloric stenosis
is often used in the course of the article to include any obstruction
to the passage of the contents of the stomach into the intestine,
whether the obstruction be in the duodenum, the pyloric orifice, or the
pyloric region.]The most frequent cause of pyloric stenosis is carcinoma, either in the
form of a diffuse infiltration of the gastric walls in this region or
as a tumor projecting into the cavity of the pyloric portion of the
stomach.Next in frequency are cicatricial growths resulting from
simple ulcer involving the pyloric region.Much less frequent are
similar cicatricial stenoses of the pylorus resulting from ulcers
produced by swallowing corrosive poisons.Simple hypertrophy of the
coats of the stomach in the pyloric region, particularly of the fibrous
and muscular coats, is an occasional cause of dilatation.Obstruction
of the pylorus by mucous polypi or by hypertrophic folds of mucous
membrane is so rare as to have little practical interest.Likewise,
stenosis caused by sarcomata, fibromata, myomata, lipomata, and cysts
need be mentioned only for the sake of completeness.Narrowing of the pyloric orifice may be caused also by pressure from
outside of the stomach, as by tumors, particularly cancer, of the liver
and of the pancreas, and by the contraction of fibrous adhesions and
thickenings resulting from perigastritis.Obstruction of the duodenum
by tumors growing in its walls, by cicatrices resulting from ulcers,
and by external pressure may also cause dilatation of the stomach.According to Barker, compression of the duodenum by a wandering right
kidney may induce dilatation of the stomach.The mere association of
dilatation of the stomach and movable right kidney, however, cannot be
considered proof that the former is caused by the latter, for the
subjects of movable kidney (most frequently women with flabby abdominal
walls who have borne many children) are often also favorable subjects
for atonic dilatation of the stomach.Sometimes with dilatation of the stomach the pyloric orifice is found
abnormally small, without any thickening or other appreciable change in
the walls of the pylorus.These cases in adults have been described by
{588} Landerer under the name of congenital stenosis of the pylorus,
but his conclusions are not free from doubt.[5] Congenital stenosis,
and even complete occlusion of the pylorus, has been observed in
infants.[6]

[Footnote 5: _Ueber angeborene Stenose des Pylorus_, Inaug.Diss.,
Tubingen, 1879.In the ten cases studied by Landerer the patients were
all adults, mostly in advanced life.In only one case is it mentioned
that indigestion existed from childhood; the clinical history in all is
incomplete.With the exception of one case there was no marked
hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the stomach, such as is usually
found with benign pyloric stenosis and would naturally be expected with
a stenosis existing since birth.The pyloric orifice varied from 1-1/2
cm.Some of the specimens had been in alcohol for
a considerable time.In my opinion, Landerer has not brought forward
sufficient proof that in these cases stenosis of the pylorus existed
since birth.][Footnote 6: Wunsche, _Jahrb.d. Kinderheilk._, viii.Andral, Forster, and Bull have found congenital stenosis and atresia of
the pylorus.]Spasm of the pyloric muscle, which, according to Kussmaul, may be
referable to erosions, ulcers, and inflammations of the adjacent mucous
membrane, can be admitted only as a hypothetical explanation of some
cases of dilatation of the stomach.Somewhat problematical, although not improbable, is the production of
stenosis of the pylorus or of the duodenum by torsion and by
displacement of these parts.Dilatation of the stomach is sometimes
associated with scrotal hernia, particularly with that containing
omentum or transverse colon.This dilatation Kussmaul explains by the
production of a sharp bend between the movable first part and
comparatively fixed second part of the duodenum, in consequence of the
dragging downward of the stomach by the displaced omentum or transverse
colon.In a similar way Kussmaul believes that the weight of an
over-distended stomach may produce stenosis, and by this mechanism he
explains the occasional occurrence of symptoms of complete pyloric
obstruction when a large quantity of material has accumulated in an
already dilated stomach, and the prompt relief of these symptoms when
the burden of the stomach is removed either by vomiting or by the
stomach-tube.[7]

[Footnote 7: Another explanation given by Kussmaul, and likewise based
upon experiments on the cadaver, is that when the stomach is
over-distended it may rotate upon its own axis, so that the pylorus
acquires a sagittal direction and impinges against the first part of
the duodenum.This rotation of the stomach, however, can occur only
when the abdominal walls are flabby (Kussmaul, "Die Peristaltische
Unruhe des Magens," _Volkmann's Samml.The manner in which stenosis of the pylorus causes dilatation of the
stomach is sufficiently obvious to require no especial explanation.It
is, however, important to know that stenosis of the pylorus may be
compensated, so that even a very considerable degree of obstruction of
this orifice may exist without any dilatation of the stomach.The
obstruction may be completely counteracted by hypertrophy of the
muscular coat of the stomach, particularly of that in the right half of
the organ.Leube suggests that this increased muscular force, by
increasing the peristaltic movements, may also hasten the digestion and
absorption of the food, so far as these processes take place in the
stomach.[8] The timely removal of the contents of the stomach by
vomiting may also prevent over-distension of the organ.Another
compensatory circumstance may be the reduction of the quantity of solid
and liquid food taken by the patient.Conditions are often present,
however, which oppose the development of these {589} compensatory
circumstances.Such conditions are feebleness of the patient,
degeneration of the muscular coat of the stomach, chronic catarrhal
gastritis, insufficient secretion of gastric juice, and delayed
absorption, causing stagnation and fermentation of the food in the
stomach.[Footnote 8: Leube, in _V.Dilatation of the stomach may occur without any obstacle to the
evacuation of the gastric contents into the intestine.The cases of
so-called atonic dilatation of the stomach belong to this class.The
degree of dilatation in these cases is rarely so great as when the
dilatation is caused by stenosis.The cause of gastric dilatation in
the absence of stenosis is not always clear, so that a variety of
hypotheses, more or less probable, have been broached to explain these
obscure cases.Dilatation with unobstructed outlet of the stomach must be referable
either to abnormalities in the quantity or quality of the contents of
the stomach or to weakness of the muscular walls of the stomach.In
most cases both of these causes are combined, and it is not easy to
separate their action.Abnormal gastric contents may be the result of improper ingesta or of
disturbances in gastric digestion.Although in former times the
frequency of excessive eating and drinking as a cause of dilatation of
the stomach was doubtless exaggerated, nevertheless the efficacy of
this cause cannot be doubted.Dilatation of the stomach is said to be
common in people who live almost exclusively upon a vegetable diet and
therefore require large quantities of food.The habitual drinking of
large quantities of beer may cause dilatation of the stomach.The
occasional association of a dilated stomach with diabetes is referred
to the inordinate appetite and thirst which characterize this disease.If the food reaches the stomach imperfectly masticated, the process of
digestion is delayed, and as a result the stomach may become dilated.Indigestible food, particularly that which readily ferments in the
stomach, may be an indirect cause of the disease under consideration.A
similar role may be played by swallowing foreign substances either by
accident or by design.It is not proven that dilatation of the stomach
may be referable to exhaustion of its muscular power by the abuse of
agents which at first excite peristalsis, such as emetics, purgatives,
alcoholics, tobacco, spices, etc.Equally doubtful is the production of
dilatation by the misuse of narcotics, such as opium, which restrain
peristalsis.Of great importance in the production and continuance of gastrectasia
are all circumstances which cause stagnation and fermentation of the
contents of the stomach.These abnormalities of the gastric contents
are referable both to muscular and to chemical insufficiency of the
stomach, but in this connection it is desired to call attention
especially to chemical insufficiency, although in the production of
gastric dilatation this becomes always associated with muscular
insufficiency.In this way chronic catarrhal gastritis is operative in
the causation of gastric dilatation.In consequence of insufficient
secretion of normal gastric juice and of delayed absorption, the food
remains abnormally long undigested in the stomach, and fermentative
changes, with the development of gas, occur.No less important,
however, is the impairment of the muscular power of the stomach in
chronic gastritis.Stagnation and fermentation of the contents of the
stomach occur also in functional or atonic dyspepsia, which is to be
reckoned as a cause of dilatation of the stomach.{590} Naunyn[9]
emphasizes especially the importance of abnormal fermentations in the
stomach (alcoholic, butyric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid
fermentations) both as a cause and as a result of dilatation of the
stomach.Ulcer and cancer of the stomach may cause dilatation by
interfering with the normal digestive processes.[Footnote 9: _Deutsches Arch.We come now to the third and final group of causes of dilatation of the
stomach--namely, those included under weakness of the muscular walls of
the stomach.In the last analysis all causes of gastric dilatation come
under this heading, for even with pyloric stenosis and with excessive
contents a stomach will not dilate so long as its muscular power is
equal to the proper performance of the work which is demanded.In this
connection, however, reference is had especially to those cases in
which impairment or restraint of the muscular movements of the stomach
may be regarded more or less directly as the primary cause of
dilatation of the stomach.Clearest of comprehension are those cases in which the muscular power
of the stomach is impaired by organic changes in the muscular coat.Here may be mentioned partial destruction of the muscular coat,
particularly of that in the pyloric region, by ulcers and by cancers.Thus, ulcers and cancers which in no way obstruct the outlet of the
stomach may cause dilatation of the organ.Inflammatory infiltration
(inflammatory oedema) of the muscular coat has been adduced as a cause
of its weakness in chronic catarrhal gastritis and in peritonitis.Whether this is the proper explanation or not, there is no doubt that
the muscular coat of the stomach may become paretic in cases of chronic
catarrhal gastritis, as well as the subjacent muscle in inflammations
of other mucous membranes, as in laryngitis or in cystitis.Our
knowledge of the relation between degeneration of the muscular coat of
the stomach and gastrectasia is very imperfect.Fatty and colloid
degeneration of the muscle of dilated stomachs is probably to be
interpreted as a secondary change.It is probable that amyloid
degeneration may be a cause of atonic dilatation of the stomach.[10]
Oedematous infiltration of the coats of the stomach in cases of
cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary emphysema, cardiac disease, and
Bright's disease has been assigned as a cause of gastric dilatation,
but without satisfactory evidence.Chronic interstitial gastritis
(cirrhosis of the stomach) is more frequently a cause of contraction
than of dilatation of the stomach.[Footnote 10: Edinger, _ibid._, Bd.The restraint of the muscular movements of the stomach by adhesions and
by dragging downward of the organ in hernia may cause dilatation.Relaxation of the abdominal walls, as in women who have borne many
children, by removing the normal support of the stomach, has been
thought to cause dilatation.Atony of the muscular walls of the stomach may be a part of general
muscular weakness and impaired nutrition.Here belong cases of adynamic
dilatation of the stomach secondary to typhoid fever, cholera,
tuberculosis, anaemia, chlorosis, cachexia, senile marasmus,
neurasthenia.Whether primary paralysis of the stomach can occur or not is wholly
uncertain.We have no positive knowledge as to the occurrence of
paresis of the stomach in consequence of organic or functional changes
{591} in the peripheral or central nervous system.Nor does our meagre
information as to the relation between the nervous system and the
muscular movements of the stomach justify the construction of any
hypotheses as to this point.For the sake of clearness the various causes of dilatation of the
stomach according to the foregoing classification may be recapitulated
as follows.Some of the more doubtful and of the rarer causes are
omitted:

  A. Stenosis of the Pylorus or of the Duodenum.Cancerous;
    2.Cicatricial;
    3.Hypertrophic (of pylorus);
    4.From external pressure;
    5.B. Abnormalities in Contents of Stomach.Ingesta:
      _a_.Excessive;
      _b_.Imperfectly masticated;
      _c_.Stagnation and fermentation in consequence of chemical
         insufficiency of the stomach, as in chronic catarrhal
         gastritis and functional dyspepsia.C. Impairment of Muscular Force of Stomach.Organic changes in muscular coat:
      _a_.Partial destruction by ulcers and cancers;
      _b_.Inflammation, as in chronic catarrhal gastritis and
             peritonitis;
      _c_.Degenerations (fatty, colloid, amyloid);
      _d_.;
      _e_.Mechanical Restraint:
      _a_.By adhesions;
      _b_.Impaired Nutrition and General Muscular Weakness, Adynamic
         dilatation from typhoid fever, tuberculosis, anaemia, etc.As a rule, not a single one, but several, of the above-mentioned causes
are operative in the production of dilatation of the stomach, and it is
often impossible to say which is the primary cause.The various gastric
functions are so dependent upon each other that if one is disturbed the
others also suffer.If, for instance, atony of the muscular coat of the
stomach exists, then in consequence of enfeebled peristalsis the
secretion of gastric juice is insufficient, the food is not thoroughly
mingled with the gastric juice, and the absorption of the products of
digestion in the stomach is interfered with; in consequence of which
the accumulating peptones still further hinder the digestive process.The pylorus remains contracted for an abnormal length of time, as it
naturally is closed until the process of chymification in the stomach
is far advanced, and this process is now delayed.The stagnating
contents of the stomach readily ferment, and the irritating products of
fermentation induce a chronic {592} catarrhal gastritis, which further
impairs the functions of the mucous and muscular coats of the stomach.Thus, in a vicious circle one cause of dilatation induces another.To
assign to each cause its appropriate share in the production of the
final result is a matter of difficulty, and often of impossibility.From this point of view the dispute as to whether in atonic dilatation
the most important factor in causation is chemical insufficiency of the
stomach (impaired secretion of gastric juice, fermentations) or
mechanical insufficiency (weakened muscular action, stagnation),
appears of little practical importance.Of the causes of non-stenotic dilatation of the stomach, the first
place is to be assigned to chronic catarrhal gastritis and to atonic
dyspepsia, as this term is understood by most English and American
writers.As regards frequency, gastric dilatation is a common result of cancer
of the pylorus.It is less frequently caused by simple ulcer.Other
forms of pyloric stenosis than the cancerous and the cicatricial are
rare.Opinions differ as to the frequency of non-stenotic or atonic
dilatation of the stomach according to the manner in which one
interprets the cases.Non-stenotic dilatations which are comparable in
degree to those produced by stenosis are rare.The lesser grades of
atonic dilatation, however, are not rare; but here arises the
difficulty of distinguishing these cases from mere chemical or
mechanical insufficiency of the stomach, which often represents the
early stage of the process.Hence it has been proposed to discard
altogether the term dilatation, and to substitute that of insufficiency
of the stomach.But this latter term is applicable to many affections
of the stomach other than dilatation.A typical case of atonic
dilatation of the stomach is a well-defined disease, and because it is
difficult to diagnosticate its early stages is not sufficient reason
for discarding altogether the designation.Gastrectasia may develop at any age.It is most frequent in middle and
advanced life.The largest number of cases of atonic dilatation is met
with between thirty and forty years of age.[11] The disease occurs in all classes of life.Atonic
dilatation seems to be comparatively more frequent in private practice
and among the favorably situated than in hospitals and among the poor.Kussmaul says that the largest contingent of patients is furnished by
persons who lead a sedentary life and eat and drink a great deal.[Footnote 11: Kundrat and Widerhofer mention no case of stenotic
dilatation of the stomach in children.They say, however, that atonic
dilatation due to over-feeding, and particularly to rachitis, is not
infrequent in children.Widerhofer reports a case of very large
dilatation of the stomach in a girl twelve years old.The cause of the
dilatation was not apparent, and the clinical history was imperfect
(_Gerhardt's Handb.d. Kinderkrankh._, Bd.Lafage
(_These_, Paris, 1881) reports a case of gastric dilatation at ten
years, and another at sixteen years of age.R. Demme (abstract in
_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1883, No.1) reports a case of large
dilatation of the stomach in a boy six and a half years old.Cicatricial stenosis was suspected.Pauli (_De Ventriculi Dilatatione_,
Frankfurt, 1839) reports an enormous dilatation of the stomach,
believed to be due to congenital stenosis.]SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Inasmuch as dilatation of the stomach is usually
secondary to some other disease, the symptoms of the primary disease
have often existed a long time before those of dilatation appear.The subjective symptoms of gastric dilatation are for the most part
directly referable to disturbances of the functions of the stomach.These {593} subjective symptoms alone do not suffice for a positive
diagnosis of the disease.Of the greatest diagnostic importance are an
examination of the vomit and a careful physical exploration of the
stomach.The appetite with dilatation of the stomach may be normal, diminished,
increased, or perverted.In the majority of cases the appetite is
diminished, and there may be complete anorexia.Sometimes the appetite
is increased even to voracity, which is explicable by the small amount
of nutriment which is absorbed.Polyphagia may therefore be a result as
well as a cause of dilatation of the stomach.Often there is excessive thirst in consequence of the small quantity of
fluid absorbed.Dilatation of the stomach in itself does not usually cause sharp
epigastric pain, although it is often associated with painful diseases
of the stomach.There is usually in the region of the stomach a sense of fulness and
weight, which is often distressing and may be accompanied with dull
pain.Heartburn and eructations of gas and of bitter or of acid fluids are
frequently present.The gas is often odorless, but sometimes it is very
offensive.In a number of
cases--which, however, are exceptional--the gas has been found
inflammable, burning usually with a colorless flame (hydrogen), but
rarely, as in a case from Frerichs' clinic, with a bright
yellowish-white flame (hydrocarbons).Detonation upon setting fire to
the gas has been noted.The analysis of the inflammable gas has shown
oxygen and nitrogen in approximately the same proportion as in the
atmosphere, in addition to large quantities of carbonic acid and of
hydrogen, also marsh gas, and in Frerichs' case olefiant gas in small
amount.[12] The oxygen and nitrogen are doubtless simply swallowed, but
the carbonic acid and hydrogen are the result of abnormal fermentations
in the stomach.The origin of the hydrocarbons in the gas is not clear,
but they are probably also produced by fermentation within the stomach.[Footnote 12: One of the analyses in Frerichs' case gave carbonic acid,
17.40; hydrogen, 21.52; marsh gas, 2.71; olefiant gas, traces; oxygen,
11.91; nitrogen, 46.44.In another analysis were found marsh gas,
10.75, and olefiant gas, 0.20.Sulphuretted hydrogen was also present
(Ewald, in _Reichert und Du Bois-Reymond's Archiv_, 1874, p.One of the most frequent symptoms, although not a constant one, of
dilatation of the stomach is vomiting.This symptom often presents
characters which, if not pathognomonic of dilatation, at least raise a
strong presumption in favor of its presence.The act of vomiting is
sometimes accomplished with such ease that it is hardly more than
regurgitation; at other times the act is accompanied with violent and
exhausting retching.A feature particularly characteristic of
dilatation of the stomach is the abundance of the vomited material.In
no other disease is such an enormous quantity evacuated from the
stomach at one time.Blumenthal relates a case in which the vomited
material amounted to sixteen pounds.Such large quantities can
accumulate in the stomach of course only when a considerable time
intervenes between the acts of vomiting.The vomiting of gastric
dilatation does not generally occur until some hours after a meal.It
often presents a certain periodicity, occurring, for instance, at
intervals of two or three days, and followed usually by temporary
relief.It is often observed that as the stomach {594} becomes larger
and larger the vomiting becomes less and less frequent, but at the same
time more abundant.Especially toward a fatal termination of the
disease the walls of the stomach may become so paralyzed and
insensible, and the patient so feeble, that the vomiting ceases
altogether.Another valuable diagnostic sign furnished by the vomit is
the presence of undigested food which has been taken a considerable
time, it may be many days, previously.[13] If the morning vomit
habitually contains undigested food which has been eaten the previous
day, gastric dilatation either exists or is almost sure to develop.[Footnote 13: Ritter relates the case of a man who vomited cherry-pits,
although he had not eaten cherries for over a year (_Canstatt's
Jahresbericht_, 1851, iii.The vomited matter is almost always in a condition of fermentation.If
the vomit be allowed to stand in a vessel, it will separate into three
layers--an upper, frothy; a middle, of turbid fluid, usually yellowish
or brownish in color; and a lower layer, composed of solid particles,
mostly alimentary debris.The vomit often emits an extremely offensive
odor.Different kinds of
fermentation--alcoholic, acetous, lactic acid, and butyric acid--are
present, usually in combination with each other.The microscope
reveals, besides undigested and partly-digested food, crystals of fatty
acids, sarcinae ventriculi, fungus-spores, and various forms of
bacteria, particularly rod-shaped ones.The connection between sarcinae
and fermentative processes is not understood.There is no evidence that
sarcinae are capable of causing fermentation.Of greater importance is
the recognition by the microscope of the spores of the yeast-fungus
(Torula cerevisiae).These spores are rarely absent, and their constant
presence is evidence that fermentation is in progress.Fermentation
often exists in undilated stomachs, but, as has already been mentioned,
it is an important factor in the production of dilatation, so that its
early recognition, if followed by proper treatment (washing out the
stomach especially), may ward off the development of dilatation.The
article on GASTRIC CANCER is to be consulted with reference to the
habitual absence of free hydrochloric acid from the stomach in cases of
cancerous dilatation.If cancer or ulcer of the stomach exists, blood
is frequently present in the vomit, but even in the absence of ulcer or
cancer or other demonstrable source of hemorrhage the vomit in cases of
dilatation of the stomach may exceptionally contain blood, even for a
considerable length of time.If the dilatation be due to pyloric
stenosis, bile is not often found in the vomited material.It has already been mentioned that vomiting is not a constant symptom
of dilatation of the stomach.It remains to add that vomiting may be
present without any of the distinctive features which have been
described.Gastric dilatation, especially in its early stages, is often
accompanied by attacks of acute indigestion (embarras gastrique) after
some indiscretion in diet.Constipation is an almost constant symptom of dilatation of the
stomach.This is naturally to be expected when so little substance
passes from the stomach into the intestine.The constipation is also to
be explained in part by the absence of the usual reflex stimulus which
the stomach during digestion normally exerts upon intestinal
peristalsis, for the constipation is usually much relieved when the
overweighted stomach is systematically washed out.{595} Occasionally, attacks of diarrhoea occur in cases of dilatation
of the stomach.The diarrhoea may perhaps be explained by the sudden
discharge of a large quantity of fermenting material from the stomach
into the intestine.With marked dilatation of the stomach, especially when there is profuse
vomiting, the urine is often considerably diminished in quantity.Particularly in cases treated by systematic washing out of the stomach,
but also in other cases, especially with abundant vomiting, the acidity
of the urine is often much reduced.The reaction may be even
continuously alkaline (Quincke).Crystals of phosphate of magnesium
have been occasionally found in the alkaline urine of gastrectasia
(Ebstein).The urine is prone to deposit abundant sediments.It often
contains an excess of indican.The patient may suffer from attacks of dyspnoea and of palpitation of
the heart in consequence of flatulent distension of the stomach.The general condition of the patient will of course depend chiefly upon
the character of the primary disease and upon the severity of the
gastric symptoms.A moderate degree of dilatation may exist without
much disturbance of the general health of the patient.But as the
disease progresses and the food stagnates more and more in the stomach,
finally to be rejected by vomiting, the patient cannot fail to lose
flesh and strength.In extreme cases of gastrectasia, even without
organic obstruction, the patient may be reduced to a degree of
emaciation and of cachexia indistinguishable from that of cancer.As in
so many other gastric diseases, the patient is usually mentally
depressed and hypochondriacal.He suffers much
from headache and vertigo.He feels incapable of physical or mental
exertion.The skin is dry and harsh; the extremities are cold.Toward
the last, cachectic oedema about the ankles can often be recognized.Kussmaul was the first to call attention to the occurrence of tetanic
spasms in cases of dilatation of the stomach.[14] This symptom has been
observed almost exclusively in an advanced stage of the disease when
the patient has become anaemic and weak.The spasms come on chiefly
after attacks of profuse vomiting or after evacuating large quantities
by the stomach-tube.The spasms may be preceded by a sense of pain or
distress in the region of the stomach, by dyspnoea, by numbness of the
extremities, or by great prostration.The tetanic spasms affect
especially the flexor muscles of the hand and forearm, the muscles of
the calves of the legs, and the abdominal muscles.The spasm may be
confined to one or more of these groups of muscles, or there may be
general tetanic contraction of the muscles of the body.Sometimes
typical epileptiform convulsions with loss of consciousness occur.With
general tetanic spasms the pupils are usually contracted, and often
irresponsive to light.Sometimes there is abnormal sensitiveness upon
pressure over the contracted muscles.The spasms may last for only a
few minutes, or they may continue for several hours, or even for days.After their disappearance the patient is left extremely prostrated.Although tetanic spasms increase the gravity of the prognosis, they are
not necessarily fatal.[Footnote 14: _Deutsches Arch.Kussmaul considers that these spasms are analogous to those occurring
in cholera, and are referable to abnormal dryness of the tissues in
consequence of the extraction of fluid.This view is supported by the
usual {596} occurrence of the spasms after profuse vomiting or after
washing out the stomach.Another explanation, which is perhaps more
applicable to the epileptiform attacks, refers the convulsions to
auto-infection by toxic substances produced in the stomach by abnormal
fermentative and putrefactive changes (Bouchard).[15]

[Footnote 15: Laprevotte, _Des Accidents tetaniformes dans la
Dilatation de l'Estomac_, These, Paris, 1884, p.Coma, with or without the peculiar dyspnoea of diabetic coma, is a rare
occurrence in gastrectasia.(For a description of this form of coma see
page 205.)The temperature in gastric dilatation is generally unaffected.Penzoldt, however, saw two cases with moderate rise of temperature in
the evening, which could not be explained by any complication.On the
other hand, abnormally low temperature with slow pulse has been
observed (Wagner).Essential to the diagnosis of gastric dilatation is the physical
examination of the stomach.If the stomach be markedly dilated, inspection may reveal an abnormal
prominence of the abdominal walls in the epigastric region and
extending a variable distance below the level of the umbilicus.This
prominence is most marked on the left side.When the abdominal walls
are sufficiently thin and relaxed, sometimes the outline of the greater
curvature between the umbilicus and pubes, less frequently that of the
lesser curvature, can be made out.Sometimes the peristaltic waves of
the stomach can be perceived through the thin abdominal walls.By
pressure or by passing the hand across the abdomen gastric peristalsis
may sometimes be excited.The peristaltic movements of the stomach,
however, are rarely perceived except when the dilatation is due to
stenosis and the muscular coat of the stomach is hypertrophied.The
peristaltic waves generally pass from left to right, rarely in the
opposite direction as well.Careful attention to the situation,
direction, and extent of these waves is necessary to distinguish them
from similar peristaltic movements of the intestine.[16] The diminution
in size of the abdominal prominence caused by a dilated stomach after
profuse vomiting or after washing out the stomach may aid in the
diagnosis.[Footnote 16: Kussmaul says that vigorous peristaltic movements of the
stomach may be perceptible through the abdominal walls even when there
is no dilatation of the stomach.Under these circumstances he
attributes the peristaltic commotion to an independent neurosis of the
stomach ("Die Peristaltische Unruhe des Magens," _Volkmann's Samml.An important aid in bringing out the contours of the stomach is the
artificial distension of the organ by the generation within it of
carbonic acid gas, as first suggested by Frerichs.For this purpose
20-30 grains of bicarbonate of sodium and 15-20 grains of tartaric
acid, each dissolved in a little lukewarm water, may be given one after
the other.If the stomach be much dilated and relaxed, it may be
necessary to give much larger quantities of the powders (up to 2-2-1/2
drachms of the soda and a corresponding quantity of the acid).It is
well to have a stomach-tube at hand in order to withdraw the gas in
case unpleasant symptoms develop.Sometimes the stomach fails to become
distended by this procedure.This is due in some cases to the escape of
the gas through the pyloric orifice into the intestine--a condition
designated by Ebstein as incontinence of the pylorus.It may be that
sometimes the gas produces such firm {597} contraction of the gastric
walls that the stomach does not expand by the pressure of the gas.Instead of generating gas, a similar result may be produced by simply
injecting air into the stomach through a stomach-tube, as recommended
by Oser and by Runeberg.The air may, however, escape along the side of
the tube.Palpation of the distended stomach yields an elastic resistance which
has been compared to that of an air-cushion.By palpating carefully
from above downward the greater curvature can sometimes be appreciated,
but in general it is difficult to distinguish it from the transverse
colon.Peristaltic movements may perhaps be appreciated by palpation
when they are not evident on inspection.If a dilated stomach contains
considerable fluid and the abdominal walls are yielding, fluctuation
may be perceived by palpation.The lowest level at which this
fluctuation can be felt may afford a clue as to the position of the
lower border of the stomach, but not much dependence can be placed upon
this sense of fluctuation unless many sources of error in its
interpretation are excluded.By pressing gently and repeatedly against the abdominal walls a
splashing sound can usually be heard in cases of well-marked dilatation
of the stomach (bruit de clapotement).This sound can best be brought
out when the patient is in the recumbent position, with relaxed
abdominal walls, by palpating near the left border of the ribs.The
same sound can be produced by shaking the patient (bruit de glou-glou).This sound may be heard at a considerable distance from the patient, to
whom it may be a source of much annoyance.In itself this splashing
sound is without diagnostic significance, as the condition for its
production--namely, the simultaneous presence of gas and liquid in the
stomach--exists often in healthy persons.By paying attention, however,
to the time at which this sound can be produced after eating or
drinking, and to its greater or less constancy, some diagnostic
importance can be attached to this sign.If the splashing sound can be
usually produced two hours or longer after the ingestion of liquid or
six hours after an ordinary meal, it generally indicates that
dilatation of the stomach exists.[17] It is necessary to exclude
somewhat similar sounds which may be produced in the intestines,
particularly in the transverse colon and caecum.The series of gurgling
sounds which may sometimes be produced in the intestine by palpation
are not likely to be confounded with the single splashing sound
produced in the stomach, but under certain circumstances a splashing
sound may be produced in the transverse colon which cannot be
distinguished from the gastric sound.If a dilated stomach contains a
very large quantity of fluid, the splashing sound cannot readily be
produced.[Footnote 17: Baradat, _Etude sur le Bruit de Clapotement stomacal_,
These, Paris, 1884.Baradat says that this bruit is also diagnostic of
dilatation when it can be produced by palpating below a horizontal line
passing through the junction of the ninth and tenth ribs, but it is
evident that motion might be transmitted to the stomach even when its
greater curvature is above this line by palpating below the level of
the umbilicus.]Leube has pointed out that the end of the stomach-tube (of course the
hard tube), after it has been inserted into the stomach, can often be
felt through the abdominal walls.[18] He says that if the tube can be
felt below a horizontal line passing through the anterior superior
spinous processes of the ileum, dilatation of the stomach may be
positively diagnosed, {598} and the existence of dilatation is probable
if the tube can be felt much below the umbilicus.No force should be
used in trying to make the end of the tube palpable.Of course if the
abdominal walls are thick or very tense the tube cannot be felt.Leube's method is simple and convenient, and applicable to many cases.As will be explained hereafter, a position of the lower border of the
stomach even quite as low as Leube's rule demands cannot be considered
by itself positive evidence of dilatation.[19]

[Footnote 18: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 19: According to Oser, there is a possible source of error in
Leube's method--namely, that the sound may slide along the greater
curvature of the stomach, and even reach the pylorus, so that the end
may be felt higher than the lowest point of the stomach.Considerable
objection has been made to Leube's method on the ground of its danger,
but this objection is based on the assumption that greater energy is
employed in pressing forward the sound than Leube recommends (Oser,
article "Magenerweiterung" in _Eulenburg's Real Encyclopadie_, Bd.The length to which the stomach-tube can be inserted before meeting
resistance may evidently give some idea as to the size of the stomach.The attempt, however, to establish any general law with reference to
this point has not proven successful.In many cases valuable information as to the size of the stomach is
afforded by percussion.Over the greater part of the stomach the
percussion note is tympanitic, sometimes with a metallic quality.Over
the most dependent part of the stomach a dull sound is produced on
percussion in case a sufficient quantity of fluid or solid material is
contained in the viscus.In the upright position, therefore, in
percussing over the stomach from above downward, the tympanitic note
gives place to a dull sound, and this zone of dulness will change with
the position of the patient, so that in the recumbent posture the
dulness may entirely disappear.In order to prove that the region of
dulness belongs to the stomach, Piorry caused the patient to drink a
large quantity of water (a pint to a quart).In a healthy empty stomach
this quantity of water suffices to produce a zone of dulness which does
not descend below the level of the umbilicus.If, however, the dulness
be produced below the level of the umbilicus, it is inferred that
dilatation exists.Penzoldt's modification of Piorry's method gives
more certain results.[20] By withdrawing the fluid from the stomach by
the stomach-tube the dulness may be made to disappear, and by injecting
more fluid the dulness may be made to reappear at will.By noting the
lower limit of the dulness thus produced the position of the lower
border of the stomach may be determined.The farther this lies below
the umbilicus the greater, presumptively, is the degree of dilatation.The artificial distension of the stomach with gas may also aid in
determining its limits by percussion.It must be said that in general
the separation of the lower limits of the stomach from the transverse
colon by means of percussion is a matter of great difficulty, and
sometimes is impossible.[Footnote 20: Penzoldt, _op.Upon auscultation over a dilated stomach sometimes a fine crackling or
sizzling sound, like that audible upon first uncorking a bottle of
soda-water, can be heard.[21] This is referable to the fermentation
which is in progress in the stomach.Eichhorst says that a similar but
finer crackling sound can be heard over a stomach in which carbonic
acid gas is {599} being artificially generated, and that this sound
abruptly ceases when the ear passes below the limits of the greater
curvature.[22]

[Footnote 21: Pauli was the first to record this phenomenon (_De
Ventriculi Dilatatione_, Frankfurt, 1839).]The displacement of neighboring organs by a dilated stomach does not
generally give rise to important physical signs.As the tendency of a
dilated stomach is to sink down in the abdomen, there is not usually
much displacement of the thoracic viscera.If, however, the fundus of
the stomach be distended with gas, the heart may be pushed upward, and,
being pressed against the chest-wall, its apex-beat may be more
forcible and diffused than normal.The tympanitic stomach may impart a
metallic quality to the cardiac sounds.MORBID ANATOMY.--Considerable degrees of dilatation of the stomach are
easily recognized by post-mortem examination.In extreme cases the
stomach occupies all of the anterior region of the abdomen, covering
over the intestines and extending down to the pubes or even into the
true pelvis.Many cases are recorded in which the stomach was capable
of holding six to twelve pints.Godon[23] describes under the name
ventriculi hydrops a hardly credible case in which it is said that the
stomach contained ninety pounds of fluid!In the ordinary cases of
gastrectasia the lower border of the stomach is found somewhere between
the umbilicus and the pubes, frequently about a hand's breadth below
the level of the umbilicus.de Hydrops Ventriculi_, London, 1646.This
celebrated case is described with much detail.For three years the
abdomen was enormously distended, but the patient, a woman, never
vomited.The affection was supposed to be dropsy of the peritoneum.Death occurred in a condition of extreme marasmus.The pylorus was the
seat of a hydatid cyst which extended into the duodenum.The stomach,
which was enormously distended, contained ninety pounds of fluid, in
which floated a great number of hydatid cysts, some of which were
ruptured.The anterior wall of the stomach was adherent to the parietal
peritoneum.The two orifices of the stomach were drawn close to each
other.The length of the stomach equalled a Paris ell.]The fundus, being the most dilatable part of the stomach, is in most
cases disproportionately dilated in comparison with the pyloric region.This excessive dilatation of the fundus is most noticeable in
gastrectasia due to stenosis.In most cases of dilatation the pylorus
sinks down somewhat in the abdomen, but in consequence of the
distension of the lower segment of the stomach the long axis of the
organ is more nearly transverse than normal.If the pylorus be fixed,
the lesser curvature may be drawn down in its middle so as to acquire a
hooked shape.The lesser curvature, which should be covered by the
liver, may be found considerably below its normal level.The dilated
fundus may extend from the left hypochondrium into the left iliac
region.[24]

[Footnote 24: Fogt reports a case in which an enormously dilated
stomach occupied a scrotal hernia of the left side.He refers to two
other similar cases (_Aerztl.Intelligenzbl._, 1884, No.More or less dilatation of the oesophagus is associated with marked
dilatation of the stomach.If dilatation of the stomach be due to
obstruction in the upper part of the intestine, then the pyloric
orifice and the intestine on the proximal side of the obstruction will
be found dilated.The walls of a dilated stomach may be hypertrophied, and such cases are
called hypertrophic dilatation; or the walls may be of normal thickness
or may be thinned, and these cases are called atrophic or atonic
dilatation.In general, the thickness of the gastric walls in
gastrectasia {600} depends upon that of the muscular coat.As a rule,
in cases of pyloric stenosis the muscular coat of the stomach is
hypertrophied.This hypertrophy affects chiefly the muscle of the
pyloric region.The gastric walls in stenotic dilatation may, however,
be of normal thickness or even atrophied.In non-stenotic dilatation
the muscular coat may be either hypertrophied or atrophied, but it
rarely attains the thickness observed in cases of gastrectasia due to
obstruction.Maier and others have repeatedly observed fatty and
colloid degeneration of the muscular fibres of dilated stomachs.[25]
More frequently, however, no degenerative change has been found in the
muscle.[Footnote 25: _Deutsches Archiv f. klin.cit._ Maier designates as colloid degeneration a
peculiar homogeneous, glistening appearance of the muscular fibres.This change is not such as would usually be called colloid, but this
term is loosely used to designate a great variety of pathological
changes.The form of muscular hypertrophy in gastrectasia is chiefly
the numerical.]The mucous membrane in dilatation of the stomach is usually in the
condition of chronic catarrhal gastritis.Although there are various
statements as to atrophy of the gastric tubules and degeneration of the
epithelial cells in the tubes in cases of gastric dilatation,
satisfactory histological investigations of the mucous membrane of the
stomach in this disease are wanting.[26]

[Footnote 26: For satisfactory studies of this nature it is desirable
that alcohol or some preservative fluid should be injected into the
stomach immediately after death.]Atrophy of various abdominal viscera--particularly of the spleen, which
is usually small in this disease--has been attributed to the pressure
of a dilated stomach.This atrophy, however, is probably in many cases
only a part of the general emaciation and anaemia.While well-marked cases of dilatation of the stomach cannot be mistaken
on post-mortem examination, it is important to add that the
pathological anatomist cannot always decide whether or not dilatation
of the stomach exists in the clinical sense.The following
considerations will make this evident: In the first place, the stomach
is a very variable organ as regards its size, so that it is impossible
to set definite limits, and say that a stomach exceeding these is
necessarily dilated, while a stomach not exceeding these limits is
normal.In the second place, it belongs to the clinical definition of
dilatation of the stomach that the organ is insufficient for the
performance of its normal functions.This insufficiency cannot be
determined at the post-mortem table.To determine, therefore, whether
stomachs which fall within certain not easily definable limits of size
are pathologically dilated or not, it is necessary to correct and
complete the results of the post-mortem examination by a knowledge of
the clinical history.[27]

[Footnote 27: To deny all value to post-mortem examination in the
determination of dilatation of the stomach, as has been done, is
absurd.In the majority of cases this examination affords satisfactory
evidence, but for some cases a reservation like that in the text must
be made.Rosenbach in an able article shows the error of regarding
dilatation of the stomach too exclusively from the anatomical point of
view ("Der Mechanismus und die Diagnose der Mageninsufficienz,"
_Volkmann's Samml.DIAGNOSIS.--A considerable degree of dilatation of the stomach can
generally be diagnosticated without difficulty by means of the symptoms
and physical signs which have been described.The most important
diagnostic features relate to the character of the vomiting and to the
physical signs, together with the information afforded by the use of
the {601} stomach-tube.The diagnostic characters of the vomiting are
the large quantity rejected, its occurrence several hours after a meal,
its periodicity with long intervals, the temporary relief afforded, the
presence of undigested food taken a considerable time previously, and
the existence of fermentation.Washing out the stomach will also afford
evidence of stagnation of food.The time generally occupied in the
digestion of an ordinary meal is not over six to seven hours, so that
in health the contents of the stomach removed by the stomach-tube at
the end of this time should usually be free from undigested food.There
are of course individual idiosyncrasies with reference to the time
occupied in digestion, so that implicit reliance cannot be placed on
this diagnostic test.Delayed digestion is in itself no evidence of the
existence of dilatation, but the establishment of the presence of this
symptom may confirm other points in the diagnosis.Simple inspection, palpation, and percussion of the abdomen are
sometimes, although rarely, sufficient for the diagnosis of dilatation
of the stomach.Various devices have already been described which aid
in the physical examination of the stomach, such as the administration
of effervescing powders, the introduction of the stomach-tube, and
Piorry's and Penzoldt's methods of determining the lower border of the
stomach.[28] It {602} is not necessary to repeat here the diagnostic
evidence afforded by physical examination.Excellent service as these
devices often perform, it must be confessed that they do not always
answer the purpose intended.The artificial distension of the stomach
with gas does not enable us always to distinguish intestine from
stomach.If the abdominal walls are thick or very rigid, this method,
like most of the others, is of little or no assistance.Then, as
already mentioned, the administration of the powders may fail to
produce any distension of the stomach, and may possibly mislead by
causing distension of intestine.Moreover, the artificial tympanites
may cause the patient much discomfort.The method of determining the
lower border of the stomach by Piorry's or Penzoldt's method is not
always conclusive.If the stomach be much dilated, it may take a very
large quantity of water to produce an appreciable zone of dulness.If
the transverse colon be distended with feces, it will not be easy to
separate the dulness of the stomach from that of the colon.Moreover,
loops of intestine containing feces or gas may lie over the anterior
surface of the stomach.The use of the stomach-tube simply for
diagnostic purposes is, for various reasons, not always practicable.With due recognition of the important additions during the last few
years to our means of exploring the stomach, it must be admitted that
we are still far from any positive and universally applicable method of
determining the size and position of this organ during life.This
admission is the more necessary in view of the extravagant claims which
have been made for various more or less complicated contrivances for
physical exploration of the stomach.[Footnote 28: Several other methods have been suggested for determining
the size and position of the stomach, but they have not found general
acceptance.Thus, Schreiber attaches a soft rubber balloon to the end
of a stomach-tube, and after its insertion in the stomach inflates it
(_Deutsches Arch.In Neubauer's method the long
end of a syphon-tube communicating with the stomach is bent upward, and
a glass tube is placed in the bent portion.The fluid will evidently
stand at the same level in the tube as in the stomach in case the
atmospheric pressure in both is the same.The atmospheric pressure in
the stomach is produced by using a double tube or by passing a second
tube into the stomach (_Prager med.Wochenschr._, 1879).Purjesz
attached a manometer to a stomach-tube, and thought that he could fix
the position of the cardia by noting the moment when in the passage
downward of the tube the negative pressure changed to positive, but
Schreiber has shown that the manometer may indicate negative pressure
even after the tube has entered the stomach (_Deutsches Arch.It has been asserted that by means of
auscultatory percussion of a stomach artificially distended with gas
the boundaries of the organ can be determined.Leichtenstern considers
the metallic quality of the tone heard over the stomach under these
circumstances more or less characteristic, while Skamper compares the
characteristic tone to that produced by tapping with the finger on the
dorsal surface of the hand of which the valar surface is placed against
the external ear (_Inaug.Diss._, Berlin, 1879, p.It has been
claimed that the sound as of water dropping into a large cavity, which
can be heard when the patient is drinking, can no longer be heard when
the auscultating ear passes beyond the greater curvature (V.
Bamberger).Wunderlich suggests the possibility of feeling the arteries
of the greater curvature through the abdominal walls.Ferber calls
attention in cases of gastrectasia to a strip of dulness, with absent
vocal and respiratory sounds, corresponding to the posterior inferior
border of the left lung.This dulness, which is produced by material in
the most dependent part of the dilated stomach, disappears when the
patient assumes the knee-elbow position (_Deutsche Zeitschr.When it is impossible by other methods to
distinguish the lower portion of the stomach from the transverse colon,
it has been proposed to distend the colon with water, with gas, or with
air injected through a tube passed into the rectum.cit._) found that the length of a tube (hard) or bougie reaching the
bottom of the stomach, estimating from the upper incisor teeth, should
be in a normal stomach at least 5 cm.less than that of the vertebral
column (occiput to coccyx), and at the most not much more than
one-third of the length of the body (1:2.8-1:3.3).In three cases of
gastrectasia he found the length of the tube inserted into the stomach
considerably more than one-third of the length of the body (1:2.4); in
one of the cases this length even exceeded that of the vertebral
column, and in the others it nearly equalled the length of the
vertebral column.Rosenbach's method of determining the elastic and
contractile power of the stomach is ingenious, but hardly of practical
utility.By injecting air into the stomach through a bulb apparatus
attached to the end of a stomach-tube, he is able to tell when the
point of the tube passes beneath the surface of fluid in the stomach by
hearing on auscultation a characteristic moist bubbling sound.Elevation or depression of the level of the fluid can be determined by
withdrawing or by pushing forward the tube.That quantity of fluid
which, introduced into an empty stomach, causes no elevation, or
perhaps causes a depression, of the level of the food in the stomach,
indicates the utmost limit of the elastic and contractile forces of the
stomach (Rosenbach, _Volkmann's Samml.The determination of the position of the lower border of the stomach
does not in itself enable us to infer positively the size of the organ.It may be taken as a general rule that if the lower border of the
stomach be found persistently below the level of the umbilicus, the
stomach is dilated; but there are many exceptions to this rule.Sometimes an otherwise normal stomach preserves in adult life the
vertical position which it had in the foetus, so that its lowest point
may be below the umbilicus.According to Kussmaul, a vertical position
of the stomach is a predisposing cause of dilatation.Occasionally a
stomach has a looped shape, so that without any dilatation of the organ
the lowest point may fall below the level of the umbilicus.It is,
moreover, a clinical fact established by the experience of many
observers that the lower border of the stomach may be found below the
level of the umbilicus without the existence of any symptoms of
dilatation.The uncertainty of the anatomical diagnosis of dilatation of the
stomach in some cases makes it all the more necessary, as has been
repeatedly urged in the course of this article, to make a careful study
of the evidences of disordered gastric functions.The symptoms of most
importance in determining whether the condition called insufficiency of
the stomach is present or not are fermentation of the gastric contents
and the {603} persistent presence of undigested food in the stomach
beyond the limits of normal digestion.It is true that these symptoms
may be present without any dilatation of the stomach, but they are
likely to lead to dilatation if unchecked, and, what is of practical
importance, they require essentially the same treatment as dilatation.A differential diagnosis between chronic catarrhal gastritis and atonic
dyspepsia on the one hand, and the early stages of dilatation of the
stomach on the other, cannot be made with any positiveness.Of course, with our present means of diagnosis the confounding of
dilated stomachs with ascites, ovarian cysts, pregnancy, hydatid cysts
(of each of these errors there are recorded instances), is inexcusable.PROGNOSIS AND COURSE.--The prognosis of dilatation of the stomach
depends first of all upon the nature of the primary disease causing the
dilatation.The prognosis of cancerous dilatation is as unfavorable as
possible.In dilatation due to non-cancerous stenosis the prognosis is
in general more favorable.Life may be prolonged sometimes for many
years, and the patient's condition greatly benefited by proper
treatment.A permanent cure of stenotic dilatation is not impossible,
but it is rarely to be expected.Even if temporarily relieved, the
symptoms of dilatation are likely sooner or later to return and to lead
to a fatal termination.The progress of the disease depends upon the
degree and the stationary or advancing character of the stenosis.In
the article on GASTRIC ULCER mention has been made of the cure of a few
cases of desperate gastric dilatation due to cicatricial pyloric
stenosis by means of resection of the diseased pylorus.In general, the prognosis is more favorable in dilatation without
stenosis.If the degree of dilatation be only moderate, a permanent
cure may often be effected by proper treatment.If, however, the
dilatation be considerable, while the symptoms may be relieved or even
made to disappear for a time, relapses are prone to occur, and a
permanent cure is rarely obtained.Undoubtedly, Kussmaul's publication
in 1869, in giving to us a most valuable method of treatment, at the
same time raised extravagant expectations of the frequency with which
dilatation of the stomach can be cured.Too often the treatment with
the stomach-tube proves only palliative and not curative.The course of dilatation of the stomach is chronic.The mode of death
is usually by inanition, very rarely from rupture of the stomach.TREATMENT.--Reference to the causation of dilatation of the stomach
will show that there is considerable scope for the prophylactic
treatment of dilatation not referable to stenosis or incurable organic
disease.Thus, the correction of the habits of eating or drinking
inordinate quantities, or of imperfectly masticating the food in
consequence of haste or bad teeth or vicious custom, may avert the
development of gastric dilatation.Of especial importance is the timely
treatment of cases of dyspepsia or of chronic catarrhal gastritis which
are accompanied with fermentation or delayed digestion--conditions in
which the stomach-tube is of great service.Of the means at our disposal for meeting the causal and the symptomatic
indications of dilatation of the stomach, the most important by far is
the use of the stomach-tube for the purpose of emptying and of washing
out the stomach.The introduction of this procedure by Kussmaul in 1867
marked a new era in the treatment of gastric disorders.{604} By washing out the stomach we accomplish three important things:
first, we remove the weight which helps to distend the organ; secondly,
we remove mucus and stagnating and fermenting material which irritates
and often inflames the stomach and impedes digestion; and, thirdly, we
cleanse the inner surface of the stomach and obtain the beneficial
influence of the direct application of water, to which various
medicinal substances can be added.It is probable that in removing the
fermenting contents of the stomach we also remove a possible source of
self-infection of the system (see page 596).By accomplishing these things we may possibly also enable the stomach
to regain its lost elasticity and muscular contractility.But unless
the normal elastic and contractile powers of the stomach are restored,
the treatment with the stomach-tube, indispensable as it is for the
relief of symptoms, is only palliative and not curative.Whether or not
this restoration of the stomach to its normal functional activity is to
be expected depends chiefly upon the cause and the degree of the
dilatation.Unfortunately, as has already been stated under Prognosis,
the permanent cure of dilatation of the stomach due to organic
stenosis, although possible, is not to be expected, and the number of
cases in which largely dilated stomachs can be restored to their normal
volume or made to perform permanently their normal functions is small.There remains, however, a considerable number of curable cases--to be
sure, not always easily diagnosticated--in which the muscular coat of
the stomach has not been seriously damaged and in which the dilatation
is generally only moderate.Furthermore, excellent results are obtained
by the use of the stomach-tube in the cases which have been designated
insufficiency of the stomach, and which are closely allied to
dilatation--in fact, often represent its early stage.As has already
been mentioned, the most important criteria of this so-called
insufficiency are the fermentation of the contents of the stomach and
the presence therein of undigested food after the period required for
normal digestion (six to seven hours for an ordinary meal).There are two principal methods of washing out the stomach--one by the
stomach-pump, the other by the siphon process.The stomach-pump is the
older method, and still has its advocates.The pump used by Kussmaul is
the Wyman pump, described by Bowditch in the _American Journal of
Medical Sciences_, vol.This (which is also called
the Weiss pump), as well as other forms of stomach-pump, consists in
principle simply of an aspirating syringe having at its anterior
extremity two openings communicating with the barrel of the syringe.These openings can be alternately opened and closed by means of an
arrangement of valves.Through one opening, which is made to
communicate with an incompressible tube inserted into the stomach (the
other opening being now closed), the gastric contents are drawn into
the barrel of the syringe.This opening is now closed, and through the
other opening the contents of the syringe are discharged through a tube
externally.In a similar way fluid can be drawn into the syringe and
pumped into the stomach.In the siphon process the outer end of the tube inserted into the
stomach is connected with a piece of elastic tubing about three and a
half feet long, in the free end of which is inserted the extremity of a
medium-sized glass funnel.A single elastic tube about six feet long
may also be used.{605} When the funnel is elevated, water which has
been poured into it will run into the stomach.If now, before the water
has all run out, the funnel be depressed below the level of the
stomach, the fluid contents of the stomach will flow out through the
tube according to the principle of the siphon.20 and 21 will
make clear the mode of operation of this process.(The tube shown in
these figures is the Faucher tube, commonly used in France, and
consisting, with the funnel, of one piece.A longer tube than that
shown in the figure should be used.)[29]]

[Illustration: FIG.[29]]

[Footnote 29: From Souligoux, _De la Dilatation de l'Estomac_, Paris,
1883.]Another convenient but somewhat more complicated method of employing
the siphon process is according to Rosenthal's principle, and is
represented in Fig.To the outer end of the stomach-tube is
attached a Y-shaped glass tube, one arm of which is connected with an
elastic tube running to an irrigator, while the other arm is connected
with the discharging tube.Through the irrigating tube water runs into
the stomach, the discharging tube being compressed.If the discharging
tube be opened while the fluid is flowing from the irrigator, and if
then, after the establishment of a column of water in the discharging
tube, the irrigating tube be compressed or the stopcock of the
irrigator be closed, a siphon communicating with the stomach is formed
and empties this organ of its fluid contents.[30]]

[Footnote 30: From Leube, in _Ziemssen's Handb.u.
Therap._, Bd.In the siphon process the tube inserted into the stomach may be an
incompressible hard-rubber tube like that employed with the
stomach-pump, but by far the simplest, most convenient, and safest form
of stomach-tube is the soft, flexible, red rubber tube, resembling the
Jacques catheter, but of course larger and longer.[31] This soft tube
can inflict no {606} injury, and in most cases it is readily
introduced.Generally, the patient himself can best manipulate the
introduction of the tube.After the tube is introduced into the
pharynx, the patient, who should be in a sitting posture, makes
repeated acts of swallowing, by means of which, accompanied by
directing and gently pushing the tube with the fingers, the tube passes
along the oesophagus into the stomach.Often at first the nervousness
and inexperience of the patient occasion some trouble, but after a
little practice he generally succeeds in introducing the tube without
discomfort or difficulty.Before its introduction the tube should be
anointed with a little vaseline or some similar substance.In an adult
the tube is introduced for a length of at least 20 to 25 inches, and in
cases of dilatation of the stomach of course for a greater distance.Whatever form of stomach-tube be used, it is important that the tube
should be at least 30 inches long, and should be provided with one, and
preferably with two, large eyes at its distal extremity.[Footnote 31: Such a tube (marked 19 A) is made by Tieman & Co.of New
York, and is to be had of most surgical instrument-makers.(For a
fuller description of the tube and the mode of its employment see
article by W. B. Platt, "The Mechanical Treatment of Diseases of the
Stomach," _Maryland Medical Journal_, March 8, 1884.)Oser's tube is 2 meters long, and is made of mineralized rubber.The smaller has a lumen of 8 mm.The thickness of the
wall is 2-1/2 mm.In the larger tube the lumen is 10 mm., and the
thickness of the wall 3 mm.Faucher's tube is 1-1/2 meters long.The external diameter of the tube
is 10 to 12 mm.The walls are of such thickness that the tube can be
bent without effacing its lumen.At one extremity is a lateral eye with
two orifices.To the other extremity is adapted a funnel with a
capacity of about 500 grammes.]Although the stomach-pump has the advantage of more completely
evacuating the stomach and of removing coarser solid particles than is
possible with the siphon, nevertheless its disadvantages--namely, the
possibility of inflicting injury to the mucous membrane of the
stomach,[32] the expense and greater complexity of the instrument, and
the circumstance that it should be used only by the physician--in
contrast with the advantages of the siphon--namely, its cheapness,
simplicity, safety, and possible employment by the patient or his
attendants--have led to the general adoption of the latter process.Only the soft-rubber stomach-tube should be left to the employment of
the patient.[Footnote 32: A number of cases have been recorded in which pieces of
the mucous membrane of the stomach have been detached by the
stomach-pump.Although as yet no serious effects have followed this
accident, the possibility of its occurrence can certainly not be
regarded with equanimity.]Sometimes the flow through the siphon is interrupted by occlusion of
the eye of the stomach-tube by a solid mass or by some cause not always
clear.As already mentioned, it is desirable that there should be two
openings at the gastric extremity of the tube.When the flow is {607}
interrupted the position of the tube in the stomach may be changed, or
the patient may be directed to cough or to exert the pressure of the
abdominal muscles, or more water may be allowed to run into the stomach
in order to displace an occluding mass in the tube.It is, however,
well for such cases to have, if possible, a stomach-pump and an
incompressible tube in reserve.Moreover, as is apparent from the
foregoing statement of the advantages of the stomach-pump, there are
cases in which this instrument is much more useful than the siphon, so
that one cannot decide unconditionally in favor of one instrument over
the other.The stomach-tube should be secured so that there can be no possibility
of its being swallowed entirely.A string may be attached to the distal
end of the tube.Leube[33] has reported an instance in which the whole
tube disappeared into the stomach, and Jackson[34] has also narrated a
case in which an insane patient swallowed the stomach-tube.In both
cases the tube was subsequently rejected by vomiting.[Footnote 33: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 34: _Extracts from the Records of the Boston Society for
Medical Improvement_, vol.For washing out the stomach after the greater part of the contents have
been withdrawn, about a pint of tepid fluid is allowed to slowly run
into the stomach, and is then siphoned out.This process is to be
repeated several times.In general, tepid water suffices for washing
out the stomach, but it is often better to use, at least a part of the
time, a 1 to 2 per cent.solution of bicarbonate of sodium, which
facilitates the removal of mucus.The artificial and the natural Vichy
and Carlsbad waters are also excellent for this purpose.Various
additions are also made to the water with the view of counteracting
fermentative changes in the stomach.For this purpose perhaps the best
agents are salicylate of sodium (1 per cent.solution) or resorcin (2
per cent.Other substances which have also been recommended
are carbolic acid, permanganate of potassium, hyposulphite of sodium,
creasote, benzine.Simple water, however, accomplishes about all that
is possible, and many are satisfied to use it without any medication.As regards the frequency with which the stomach is to be washed out,
one is to be guided by the symptoms and the effect obtained by the use
of the stomach-tube.As a general rule, it suffices to wash out the
stomach once a day, and often the process need be repeated only every
second or third day.Opinions are divided as to the best time of day to select for washing
out the stomach.Kussmaul recommends the morning before breakfast, and
the majority have followed his advice; others prefer the evening.There
is much, however, in favor of washing out the stomach about half an
hour before the principal meal of the day.The best opportunity has
been offered for the digestion and absorption of the food taken at the
previous main meal, and the stomach is placed in the best possible
condition for the reception of more food.The habitual washing out of the stomach is not without its drawbacks.We often remove, as has been pointed out especially by Leube, not only
noxious substances from the stomach, but also the completed products of
digestion.To withdraw from the nourishment of the body this chyme
which the stomach has laboriously manufactured cannot be a matter of
indifference.Still, with the weakened absorptive powers of the
stomach, {608} and its inability to properly propel its contents into
the intestine, it is a question how much of this chyme would eventually
be utilized for nutrition.The
relief which the patient experiences when his overloaded stomach is
freed of its burden, and the knowledge that this method of relief is
always at hand, may make him careless in the observance of the dietetic
rules which are of great importance in the treatment of this disease.It is well, therefore, not to wash out the stomach oftener than is
necessary, nor to continue the habitual use of the stomach-tube longer
than is required.There are contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube.In very
rare instances the attempt to introduce the tube causes the patient so
much distress, produces such violent spasm of the pharyngeal and
adjacent muscles, or induces so much retching and vomiting, or is
attended with such prostration or even syncope, that this method of
treatment has to be abandoned.Great weakness, recent gastric
hemorrhage, ulcer of the stomach in most cases (see page 523), often
cancer of the cardia or of the oesophagus, and aneurism of the aorta,
are contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube.If we group together the results obtained by the use of the
stomach-tube in gastric dilatation, we shall find cases in which no
benefit results; cases which are benefited, but are obliged to continue
the use of the stomach-tube throughout life; cases in which recovery is
slow and gradual; cases with more or less speedy relief or apparent
cure, but followed by relapses; and cases of prompt relief and
permanent cure.The regulation of the diet is never to be neglected in cases of
dilatation of the stomach.Here the guiding principles are that little
fluid should be taken, and that the food should be small in bulk,
nutritious, easily digestible, and not readily undergoing fermentation.The patient should drink as little water as possible, and should
therefore avoid whatever occasions thirst.It is hardly practicable to
carry out the plan of giving water mostly by the rectum, as has been
proposed.In most cases milk is useful, but an exclusively milk diet is
not generally well borne on account of the quantity of fluid required.Leube's beef-solution is often serviceable.Soft-boiled eggs and tender
meats are to be allowed, particularly the white meat of fowl and rare
beefsteak, especially that prepared from scraped and finely-chopped
beef, as recommended in the treatment of gastric ulcer (page 521).Fatty, saccharine, and amylaceous articles of food--hence most
vegetables and fruits--are to be avoided on account of their tendency
to undergo fermentation in the stomach.Alcohol in any form is usually
detrimental.If gastric symptoms, particularly vomiting, be very
urgent, or if food introduced into the stomach affords little or no
nourishment, as in some cases of tight pyloric stricture, then rectal
alimentation is to be resorted to.An important indication is to restore the tone and contractile power of
the muscular coat of the stomach.For this purpose electricity, in the
form both of the constant and of the faradic current, has been
beneficially employed.The best results are reported from the use of
the faradic current.Both poles may be applied over the region of the
stomach.The application of electricity to the inside of the stomach by
means of electrodes attached to stomach-tubes or bougies is a more
{609} difficult procedure, but has its advocates.Uniformly good
results are not obtained by the use of electricity in gastric
dilatation, but there can be no doubt that in some cases decided
benefit follows this method of treatment.Nux vomica, particularly its alkaloid strychnia, has been much employed
with the view of stimulating the muscular power of the stomach.Strychnia is given either internally or hypodermically.Hypodermic
injections of ergotin have also been used for the same purpose.It has
been hoped to increase the contraction of the stomach by cold
applications to the abdomen, as by ice-bags applied immediately after
washing out the stomach.The benefit derived from these various
attempts to increase the tonicity of the gastric muscle is not very
apparent.A belt or bandage around the abdomen in order to support the stomach
sometimes makes the patient feel more comfortable; in other cases it
aggravates the symptoms.In many cases digestion is promoted by giving dilute hydrochloric acid
with or without pepsin.About ten drops of dilute hydrochloric acid may
be given half an hour to an hour after each meal.When the stomach is systematically washed out, the individual symptoms
of dilatation of the stomach will rarely require special treatment.The
sensation of fulness and weight in the stomach, the eructations, the
vomiting, and the constipation are generally relieved, at least
temporarily, by washing out the stomach.The appetite is improved, and
an increase in weight is usually soon noticeable.If heartburn and eructations of gas continue troublesome, an antacid,
such as bicarbonate of sodium or prepared chalk, will be found useful.Leube, in order to relieve constipation and to increase the peristalsis
of the stomach, administers Carlsbad water (see page 522).Not more
than five or six ounces of the water need be given, and this should be
taken slowly in divided doses.A laxative pill containing rhubarb may
be given occasionally.If anaemia be the cause or a prominent accompaniment of dilatation of
the stomach, iron may be administered in a form as little disturbing
the digestion as possible, as the effervescing citrate or the lactate,
or arsenic in the form of Fowler's solution may be tried.In general,
however, all drugs which impair the appetite or digestion are to be
withheld.The digestion and the general condition of the patient are
often benefited by massage.Resection of the pylorus in cases of cancerous and of cicatricial
stenosis of this orifice has been performed in several instances.The
subject, as regards its medical in distinction from its surgical
bearings, has already been discussed in connection with cancer of the
stomach (see page 577).Here it may be added that the propriety of
resection is less open for dispute in cases of non-cancerous pyloric
stenosis than it is in cancer of the pylorus.Remarkable results have been reported by Loreta in cases of cicatricial
stenosis of the pylorus.After performing gastrotomy he inserts his
fingers through the constricted pyloric orifice and forcibly dilates
the stricture.[35] To judge from experience in divulsing strictures in
other parts of {610} the body, it does not seem probable that a
permanent cure can be often effected by this bold and dangerous
procedure.[Footnote 35: Loreta has performed this operation successfully no less
than nine times (_The Lancet_, April 26, 1884).]Acute Dilatation of the Stomach.Under the name acute dilatation of the stomach[36] have been described
cases in which it has been supposed that a more or less suddenly
developed paralysis of the muscular coat of the stomach exists.But the
propriety of the term acute dilatation, and the very existence of an
acute paralysis of the stomach, are, to say the least, questionable.[Footnote 36: The literature pertaining to the subject of acute
dilatation of the stomach is to be found in Poensgen, _Die Motorischen
Verrichtungen des Menschlichen Magens_, Strasburg, 1882, p.As causes of this so-called acute dilatation of the stomach have been
assigned injuries, particularly those affecting the abdomen, surgical
operations involving the peritoneum, acute inflammations of the mucous
and of the peritoneal coats of the stomach, acute fevers, especially
during convalescence, and overloading the stomach with food or with
liquids.The symptoms which have been chiefly emphasized are severe abdominal
pain, tympanitic distension of the stomach, and absence or cessation of
vomiting if this has previously existed.It will be noted that
inability to vomit under these circumstances implies not only paralysis
of the stomach, but also that of the abdominal muscles.The prognosis depends on the character of the primary disease causing
the alleged paralysis.If there be acute distension of the stomach with inability of the organ
to expel its contents either externally or into the intestine, the
stomach-tube may be employed to evacuate the gas and other material
present.In a case described by Hilton Fagge[37] as acute dilatation of the
stomach the symptoms of dilatation appeared suddenly and ran an acute
course, but the autopsy showed that the dilatation was doubtless of
much longer development than the symptoms indicated.In a case reported
by Nauwerk[38] of extreme dilatation in consequence of hypertrophic
stenosis of the pylorus, after ten months of insignificant dyspeptic
symptoms there suddenly appeared, after excess in eating, symptoms of
dilatation of great severity, which continued until a fatal termination
at the end of three months.Thus it appears that chronic dilatation of
the stomach may cause little disturbance for a considerable time and
then run a rapid course.[Footnote 37: "On Acute Dilatation of the Stomach," _Guy's Hosp.[Footnote 38: _Deutsches Arch.{611}

MINOR ORGANIC AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH.(CIRRHOSIS; HYPERTROPHIC STENOSIS OF PYLORUS; ATROPHY; ANOMALIES IN THE
FORM AND THE POSITION OF THE STOMACH; RUPTURE; GASTROMALACIA.)BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.CIRRHOSIS OF THE STOMACH.DEFINITION.--Cirrhosis of the stomach is characterized by thickening of
the walls of the greater part or of the whole of the stomach in
consequence of a new growth of fibrous tissue, combined usually with
hypertrophy of the muscular layers of the stomach.The cavity of the
stomach is usually contracted, but sometimes it is of normal size or
even dilated.SYNONYMS.--Fibroid induration of the stomach; Hypertrophy of the walls
of the stomach; Chronic interstitial gastritis; Sclerosis of the
stomach; Plastic linitis.HISTORY.--The writings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
contain many records of extremely contracted stomachs with uniformly
and greatly thickened walls (Butzen, Loseke, Storck, Portal, Lieutaud,
Pohl, etc.).In the works of Lieutaud and of Voigtel may be found
references to many such cases.[1] Doubtless, some of these cases were
examples of cirrhosis of the stomach, but in the absence of
microscopical examination it is not possible to separate these from
cancer.[Footnote 1: Lieutaud, _Historia anat.-med._, t. i. p.8, Venet., 1779;
Voigtel, _Handb.Here it
may be mentioned that Diemerbroeck's case, which is so often quoted to
prove that polyphagia instead of causing gastric dilatation may produce
hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the stomach, with contraction, was
probably an instance of cirrhosis of the stomach.]Andral[2] was the first to describe fully and systematically
hypertrophy of the walls of the stomach.He attributed the lesion to
chronic inflammation.He erroneously supposed that scirrhus of the
stomach was only hypertrophy of the gastric walls.Cruveilhier[3]
distinguished between scirrhous induration and hypertrophy, which he
considered to be a final result of the irritation accompanying chronic
diseases of the stomach.Rokitansky's[4] description of fibroid
induration of the stomach, although brief, is accurate.He says that
the process usually involves the whole {612} stomach, and that it
originates in an inflammation of the submucous connective tissue.This
inflammation may occur either independently or in combination with
gastritis mucosa.Rokitansky emphasizes the error of confounding the
disease with scirrhous cancer.Bruch[5] made an elaborate study of
hypertrophy of the walls of the stomach, which he considered to be the
final stage of various chronic diseases of the stomach.Fibrous or
scirrhous cancer he considered to be nothing but this hypertrophy.[Footnote 2: _Precis d'Anat.[Footnote 3: _Anatomie pathologique_, Paris, 1830-42.]Anat._, Wien, 1855-61.]The best descriptions of cirrhosis of the stomach have been furnished
by English writers, by most of whom it is properly regarded as an
independent disease.Brinton[6] first employed the names cirrhosis of
the stomach and plastic linitis.Excellent descriptions of the disease
have been given by Hodgkin, Budd, Brinton, Habershon, H. Jones, Wilks,
Quain, and Smith.[Footnote 6: _Diseases of the Stomach_.]While in former times cirrhosis of the stomach was confounded with
cancer, in recent times it has not been separated by many from chronic
catarrhal gastritis.In German systematic works the disease receives,
as a rule, only passing mention in connection with chronic catarrhal
gastritis.ETIOLOGY.--Cirrhosis of the stomach is rare, but it is not so
exceptional as to be without any clinical importance.I have met with
three cases at post-mortem examination.The disease is more frequent in men than in women.A considerable
number of cases have occurred between thirty and forty years of age,
but the greatest frequency is after forty.At an earlier age than
twenty the disease is very rare.The causation of cirrhosis of the stomach is obscure.Nearly all
writers upon the subject have emphasized the abuse of alcohol as an
important cause in this as in other diseases of the stomach.Intemperance cannot, however, be the only cause; and here, as
elsewhere, it is not easy to say what importance is to be attached to
it as an etiological factor.In only one of the three cases which I
examined post-mortem could it be determined that the patient was an
immoderate drinker, and in one case intemperance could be positively
excluded.Other cases have been recorded in which the abuse of spirits
could be positively excluded.In one of my cases syphilis existed, as
was established by the presence of gummata in the liver.In some cases
the disease has been attributed to cicatrization of a gastric ulcer.In
a case reported by Snellen the disease followed an injury to the
epigastric region.[7]

[Footnote 7: _Canstatt's Jahresbericht_, 1856, iii.Cirrhosis of the stomach, as well as cancer, ulcer, and most other
chronic structural diseases of this organ, is usually associated with
chronic catarrhal gastritis.There is, however, no proof of the
prevalent idea that chronic catarrhal gastritis is the cause of the
enormous new growth of fibrous tissue which characterizes typical cases
of this disease.SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS.--The symptoms of cirrhosis of the stomach
are not sufficiently characteristic to warrant a positive diagnosis.Like cancer of the
stomach, it may put on various disguises.Thus, in a case of cirrhosis
of the stomach reported by Nothnagel[8] the symptoms were {613}
typically those of progressive pernicious anaemia.Association with
ascites or with chronic peritonitis may lead to a false diagnosis.Thus, in one of the cases which I examined after death, and in which
there was chronic peritonitis with abundant fluid exudation, the
disease during life was diagnosticated as cirrhosis of the liver.Most
frequently, however, cirrhosis of the stomach is mistaken for gastric
cancer, from which, in fact, it can rarely be positively
diagnosticated.[Footnote 8: _Deutsches Arch.The symptoms are usually those of chronic dyspepsia, which sooner or
later assumes a severity which leads to the diagnosis of some grave
structural disease of the stomach, usually of cancer.Indigestion, loss of appetite, oppression in the epigastrium, vomiting,
are the common but in no way characteristic symptoms of cirrhosis of
the stomach.There may be severe gastralgia, but in general the disease
is less painful than either ulcer or cancer of the stomach.The
inability to take more than a small quantity of food or of drink at a
time, with the sense of fulness which even this small quantity
occasions, has been considered somewhat characteristic of cirrhosis of
the stomach, but this symptom is too inconstant, and occurs in too many
other affections of the stomach, to be of much service in diagnosis.The symptoms of dyspepsia are often of much longer duration than in
cancer, existing sometimes for many years (up to fifteen years), but on
the other hand there have been cases in which the clinical history of
gastric cirrhosis was as rapid in its progress as cancer.Moreover,
cancer may be preceded by dyspeptic symptoms of long duration, but long
duration is the exception with cancer and the rule with cirrhosis of
the stomach.As the disease progresses the patient loses flesh and strength, and
usually dies in a condition of marasmus.Blood is rarely present in the
vomit, but in a few cases the vomiting of coffee-ground material has
been noted.By physical examination sometimes a tumor in the region of the stomach
can be felt.Under favorable circumstances it can sometimes be
determined that this tumor is smooth, elastic, tympanitic on
percussion, and presents more or less distinctly the contours of the
stomach.By administering effervescing powder it may be possible to
obtain further evidence that the tumor corresponds in its form to the
stomach.The diagnosis of contraction of the cavity of the stomach is
not easy.Some information may be afforded by noting the length to
which the inflexible stomach-tube can be passed.The quantity of water
which can be poured into the stomach until it begins to run out of the
stomach-tube may also bring some confirmatory evidence as to the
existence of contraction of the stomach.Even should the physical signs suffice to determine that the tumor is
the thickened and contracted stomach, still cancer cannot be excluded,
for this also may grow diffusely in the gastric walls and may cause
contraction of the cavity of the stomach.With our present means of
diagnosis, therefore, the most which can be said is, that a special
combination of favorable circumstances may render probable the
diagnosis of cirrhosis of the stomach, but a positive diagnosis is
impossible.MORBID ANATOMY.--In most cases of cirrhosis of the stomach the stomach
is contracted.The cavity of the stomach has been found not larger than
would suffice to contain a hen's egg, but such extreme {614}
contraction is very rare.When the stomach in this disease is found
dilated, either the thickening involves only or chiefly the walls of
the pyloric portion, or the morbid process probably began there and was
followed by dilatation.In typical cases the walls of the entire stomach are thickened, but
frequently the thickening is most marked in the pyloric region.The
walls may measure an inch and even more in thickness.The thickened
walls are dense and firm, so that often upon incision the stomach does
not collapse.Upon transverse section the different coats of the stomach can be
distinguished.The mucous membrane is least affected, being sometimes
thickened, sometimes normal or atrophied.The muscularis mucosae is
hypertrophied, and is evident to the naked eye as a grayish band.The
submucous coat is of all the layers the most thickened, being sometimes
ten to fifteen times thicker than normal.It appears as a dense white
mass of fibrous tissue.The main muscular coat is also, as a rule,
greatly hypertrophied; the grayish, translucent muscular tissue is
pervaded with streaks of white fibrous tissue prolonged from the
submucous and subserous coats.This last coat resembles in appearance
the submucous coat, which, however, it does not equal in thickness,
although it is, proportionately to its normal thickness, much
hypertrophied.The free peritoneal surface usually appears opaque and
dense.To the naked eye it is apparent that the new growth of fibrous tissue
is most extensive in the submucous coat, which it is probably correct
to regard as the starting-point of the disease.The hypertrophy of the
muscular layers is also in most cases an important element in the
increased thickness of the gastric walls.Microscopical examination[9] shows sometimes a nearly normal mucous
membrane.The tubules, however, are usually more or less atrophied.In
the case reported by Nothnagel tubules could be found only in the
pyloric region of the stomach.The essential lesion is the new growth
of fibrillated connective tissue pervading all of the coats of the
stomach.In an interesting case reported by Marcy and Griffith,[10]
which was believed to be caused by an extensive cicatrized ulcer, a new
formation of smooth muscular tissue was found not only in the main
muscular tunic and the muscularis mucosae, but also throughout the
submucosa.This peculiarity was probably referable to the cicatrization
of the ulcer.[Footnote 9: Microscopical examination is always necessary for a
positive diagnosis of cirrhosis of the stomach.In a case which I
examined post-mortem of double ovarian cancer, with multiple secondary
deposits in the peritoneum and with chronic peritonitis, the stomach
presented the typical gross appearances of cirrhosis, but here and
there were to be found nests of cancer-cells in the prevailing new
growth of fibrous tissue in the walls of the stomach.]Sci._, July, 1884, p.Not infrequently adhesions exist between the stomach and surrounding
organs.Exceptionally, a diffuse growth of fibrous tissue may invade
the greater part of the peritoneum, particularly the visceral layer,
and cause a thickening similar to that existing in the stomach.In such
cases ascites is usually a marked symptom.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of cirrhosis of the stomach is grave.The
disease runs a chronic course, and usually terminates in death by
asthenia.There is no reason to believe that the stomach can ever be
restored to its {615} normal condition.Still, cases have been reported
in which it has been supposed that cirrhosis of the stomach has
terminated in recovery.[11] The diagnosis, however, in such cases must
remain doubtful.[Footnote 11: Lesser, _Cirrhosis Ventriculi_, Inaug.Diss., Berlin,
1876; Smith, "Cirrhosis of the Stomach," _Edinb.TREATMENT.--The treatment is symptomatic, and is to be guided by the
general principles developed in previous articles concerning the
regulation of the diet and the administration of remedies.HYPERTROPHIC STENOSIS OF THE PYLORUS.The various causes of stenosis of the pylorus have already been
mentioned under DILATATION OF THE STOMACH, and the most important of
these causes have received full consideration in connection with ULCER
and with CANCER OF THE STOMACH.Only one of the varieties of pyloric stenosis can claim consideration
as an independent disease.This variety is the so-called hypertrophic
stenosis of the pylorus (Lebert) or fibroid degeneration of the pylorus
(Habershon[12]).Under the name of hypertrophic stenosis have been
described cases in which the stenosis was due to hypertrophy of only
one of the coats of the stomach, usually either the submucous or the
muscular coat, sometimes only the mucous coat.In most cases, however,
all of the coats of the stomach are involved, and the lesion is similar
to that of cirrhosis of the stomach, but it is confined to the pylorus
or to the pyloric region.In such cases there is new growth of fibrous
tissue, most marked in the submucous coat, and hypertrophy of the
muscular coat.The appearance of the pylorus in some instances of
hypertrophic stenosis has been not inappropriately compared to that of
the cervix uteri.[Footnote 12: Habershon, _On Diseases of the Abdomen_, London, 1862;
Lebert, _Die Krankh.d. Magens_, Tubingen, 1878; Nauwerk, _Deutsches
Arch.In the majority of cases the change here described is the result of
cicatrization of a gastric ulcer, and some believe that all cases of
so-called hypertrophic stenosis or fibroid degeneration of the pylorus
are referable to ulcer, although it may be very difficult to discover
the cicatrix of the ulcer.It is certainly not always possible to
detect either ulcer or cicatrix, so that it seems proper to regard the
hypertrophic stenosis in such cases as constituting an independent
affection.The symptoms are those of dilatation of the stomach, sometimes preceded
by evidences of chronic catarrhal gastritis.The thickened pylorus can
sometimes be felt during life as a small, cylindrical, usually movable
tumor, either stationary in progress or of very slow growth.In most cases the diagnosis of organic stenosis of the pylorus can be
made.Cancer may sometimes be excluded by the long duration of the
symptoms and the stationary character of the tumor if a tumor can be
felt.The exclusion of ulcer is more difficult and hardly possible, for
ulcer may have existed without producing characteristic symptoms.The prognosis and treatment have been considered under DILATATION OF
THE STOMACH.{616} ATROPHY OF THE STOMACH.Atrophy of the stomach may be the result of stenosis of the cardia or
of the oesophagus.The stomach may participate with other organs in the
general atrophy attending inanition and marasmus.The walls of a
dilated stomach may be very thin.Especial importance has been attached in recent years to degeneration
and atrophy of the gastric tubules.The glands of the stomach may
undergo degeneration and atrophy in various diseases of the stomach,
such as chronic catarrhal gastritis, phlegmonous gastritis, cirrhosis
of the stomach, and cancer of the stomach.Parenchymatous and fatty
degeneration of the glandular cells of the stomach occurs in acute
infectious diseases, as typhoid fever and yellow fever, also as a
result of poisoning with phosphorus, arsenic, and the mineral acids.It is claimed by Fenwick that atrophy of the stomach may occur not only
as a secondary change, but also as a primary disease attended by grave
symptoms.Fenwick has described a number of cases in which the gastric
tubules were atrophied without thickening of the walls of the stomach
and without diminution in the size of the cavity of the stomach--cases,
therefore, which cannot be classified with cirrhosis of the
stomach.[13] He attributes in many cases the atrophy of the tubules to
an increase in the connective tissue of the mucous membrane, and draws
a comparison between atrophy of the stomach and the atrophic form of
chronic Bright's disease.[Footnote 13: _The Lancet_, 1877, July 7 _et seq._]

In 1860, Flint[14] called attention to the relation between anaemia and
atrophy of the gastric glands.He expressed the opinion that some cases
of obscure and profound anaemia are dependent upon degeneration and
atrophy of the glands of the stomach.Since Flint's publication cases
have been reported by Fenwick, Quincke, Brabazon, and Nothnagel, in
which lesions supposed to be due to pernicious anaemia have been found
after death associated with atrophy of the gastric tubules.[15]
Nothnagel's case, which has already been mentioned, was one of
cirrhosis of the stomach.[Footnote 14: A. Flint, _American Medical Times_, 1860.Further
contributions of Flint to this subject are to be found in the _New York
Medical Journal_, March, 1871, and in his _Treatise on the Principles
and Practice of Medicine_, p.[Footnote 15: Fenwick, _loc.cit._; Quincke, _Volkmann's Samml.100 (case _b_); Brabazon, _British Med.Journ._, 1878,
July 27 (without microscopical examination!); Nothnagel, _Deutsches
Arch.The symptoms which have been referred to primary atrophy of the stomach
are severe anaemia and disturbances of digestion, such as anorexia,
eructations, and vomiting.The digestive disturbances are often not
greater than are frequently observed in cases of severe anaemia.In my opinion, the existence of atrophy of the stomach as a primary and
independent disease has not been established.In many cases which have
been described as primary atrophy the histological investigation of the
stomach has been very defective.Degeneration and atrophy of the
gastric tubules secondary to various diseases of the stomach and to
certain general diseases is an important lesion when it is extensive,
and must seriously impair the digestion, and consequently the
nutrition, of the patient.{617} ANOMALIES IN THE FORM AND IN THE POSITION OF THE STOMACH.These anomalies, so far as they have not received consideration in
previous articles, are of more anatomical than clinical interest, and
therefore here require only brief mention.The stomach may have an hour-glass shape in consequence of a
constriction separating the cardiac from the pyloric half of the organ.This constriction is sometimes congenital,[16] sometimes caused by
cicatrization of a gastric ulcer, and sometimes caused by spasmodic
contraction of the muscle, which may persist after death, but
disappears when the stomach is artificially distended.Hour-glass shape
of the stomach has been diagnosed during life by administering an
effervescing powder according to Frerichs' method.[Footnote 16: A careful study of the congenital form of hour-glass
contraction of the stomach has been made by W. R. Williams ("Ten Cases
of Congenital Contraction of the Stomach," _Journ.and
Physiology_, 1882-83, p.Foreign substances of hard consistence which have been swallowed
sometimes cause diverticula of the stomach.Sometimes the fundus of the stomach is but little developed, so that
the organ is long and narrow like a piece of intestine.The stomach may be variously distorted by external pressure, as from
tumors and by adhesions.The loop-shaped stomach and vertical position of the stomach have been
already considered in connection with DILATATION OF THE STOMACH (page
602).In transposition of the viscera the stomach is also transposed.In such
a case difficulties may arise in the diagnosis of pyloric cancer, as in
a case described by Legroux.The stomach may be found in hernial sacs.Mention has already been made
of the presence of dilated stomachs in scrotal hernia.More frequently
the stomach is found in umbilical hernias.In diaphragmatic hernia the
stomach is found more frequently in the thorax than is any other
abdominal viscus.In 266 diaphragmatic hernias collected by Lascher[17]
the stomach was found either wholly or partly in the thorax in 161
cases.The clinical consideration of diaphragmatic hernia, however,
does not belong here.[Footnote 17: _Deutsches Arch.Furthermore, the stomach may be displaced by tumors, enlargement of
neighboring organs, tight-lacing, adhesions, and the weight of hernias.These displacements, however, are generally inconsiderable and of
little importance.In a case described by Mazotti[18] the stomach, of which the pyloric
portion was fixed by adhesions, was twisted around its long axis.[Footnote 18: _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1874, ii.{618} RUPTURE OF THE STOMACH.Sufficient attention has already been given to perforation of the
stomach in consequence of diseases of its walls, such as ulcer, cancer,
abscesses, and toxic gastritis.A healthy stomach may be ruptured by violent injury to the abdomen even
when no external wound is produced.An example of rupture of the
stomach from this cause is that sometimes produced when a person has
been run over by a heavy vehicle.It has been claimed that a stomach with healthy walls may burst in
consequence of over-distension of the organ with solids or with gas.The older literature is especially rich in reports of so-called
spontaneous rupture of the stomach.Most of these cases were examples
of perforation of gastric ulcer.In a case of apparently spontaneous
rupture of a stomach which had become abnormally distended with gas,
Chiari[19] found that the rupture was through the cicatrix of a simple
ulcer in the lesser curvature.It is hardly conceivable that rupture of
the healthy stomach from over-distension can occur so long as the
orifices of the organ are unobstructed.Lautschner[20] reports a case of spontaneous rupture of the stomach in
a woman seventy years old with an enormous umbilical hernia which
contained the pyloric portion of the stomach.After drinking eight
glasses of water and two cups of tea and eating meat, she was seized
with vomiting, during which the stomach burst with a report which was
audible to the patient and to those around her.She passed into a state
of collapse and died in thirteen hours.A rent several centimeters long
was found in the posterior wall of the stomach.Lautschner thinks that
the pylorus was bent in the hernial sac so as to be obstructed.In the
walls of the stomach he found no evidence of pre-existing disease.[Footnote 20: _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1881, ii.]There is no satisfactory proof of the possibility of the occurrence of
rupture of a stomach with healthy walls except as a result of external
violence.The symptoms and treatment of rupture of the stomach are those of
perforation of the stomach, and have already been described.That the subject of gastromalacia should still occupy so much space in
medical works the purpose of which is mainly clinical proves that many
physicians still cling to the belief that this process may occur during
life.It is, nevertheless, certain that the condition which, according
to the ordinary and traditional use of the term, is designated
gastromalacia, is always a post-mortem process and is without the
slightest clinical significance.So long as the circulation of the
blood in the walls of the stomach is undisturbed, self-digestion of
this organ cannot occur.No one doubts {619} that parts of the gastric
walls in which the circulation has been arrested, and which are exposed
to the gastric juice, undergo self-digestion, as has already been set
forth in the article on GASTRIC ULCER.To describe cases of this nature
under the name of gastromalacia, however, is misleading, and can cause
only confusion, for the long-continued discussion as to whether
gastromalacia is a vital or a cadaveric process applied certainly to a
different conception of the term.In some of the cases which have been
published, even in recent years, in support of the vitalistic theory of
gastromalacia, and in which it has been proven that perforation of the
stomach occurred during life, the solution of continuity took place
through parts of the gastric walls in which the circulation had already
been obstructed, particularly by extensive hemorrhagic infiltration.Some of these cases are probably also examples of perforation of
gastric ulcer or of rupture of cicatrices from over-distension of the
stomach, in which post-mortem digestion of the edges of the ulcer or of
the cicatrix obscured the real nature of the process.The subject of
gastromalacia should be relegated wholly to works on physiology and on
pathological anatomy.{620}

INTESTINAL INDIGESTION.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.NATURE.--The term indigestion in its most common meaning refers to
gastric indigestion only.This limitation has arisen from the fact that
gastric digestion has been more thoroughly understood than intestinal
digestion, and because the symptoms, flatulence, acidity, eructations
of gas, pyrosis, and vomiting of unaltered food, are readily referred
to the stomach as their source.Intestinal digestion has not been well
known until within a recent date, and its phenomena in disease have
been mistaken for other pathological conditions.From the important and complex function of the intestinal juices, and
the very great share they take in the solution of food, there must be
many phases of departure from the normal state.The processes of
intestinal digestion are more intricate than those of gastric
digestion, of a higher grade, and the chemical reactions are more
numerous, depending upon the participation of the bile, the pancreatic
juice, and the succus entericus; while intestinal absorption is a more
complex act than that of gastric absorption.A brief review of the physiology of intestinal digestion will be of aid
in making clear its pathology.The object of all digestion is to make such a solution of the ingesta
that they may pass through animal membrane and so enter the system.Mechanical disintegration and simple solution do something toward this,
but for substances insoluble in water a more thorough change is brought
about by ferments which convert insoluble into soluble compounds.Mastication breaks up the
masses of food; the saliva softens them, dissolves soluble substances,
as salt and sugar, and thus the pleasures of the palate are enhanced.The ferment ptyalin acts upon starch (boiled starch being more rapidly
altered than unboiled), and changes it to dextrin and grape-sugar, both
of which are diffusible through animal membrane, entering lymph-spaces
and blood-vessels.The greater part of the saliva secreted is swallowed
with the food or in the intervals of eating.The amount formed in
twenty-four hours varies from 1500 gm.(Bidder and Schmidt) to 700 gm.It must therefore serve some ulterior purpose in the stomach.Ewald[1] says that saliva converts starch into sugar in acid as well as
in alkaline and neutral solutions.But Langley[2] asserts that the
ferment of {621} saliva is destroyed by the hydrochloric acid of the
gastric juice.The longer food is subjected to mastication and
insalivation, the more thorough is the mouth digestion and the better
prepared is the mass for the action of the gastric and intestinal
juices.It is asserted that fatty matters are emulsified to a certain
extent by the alkaline ferments of the saliva.[Footnote 1: _Lectures on Digestion_, New York, 1881, p.[Footnote 2: "On the Destruction of Ferments in the Alimentary Canal,"
_Journal of Physiology_, London, Jan., 1882, p.When the food enters the stomach the nitrogenous (albuminoid) elements
are attacked by the gastric juice, the bundles of muscular fibre are
broken up, the fibrillae are reduced to a granular mass, but not
completely dissolved (Frerichs), the fat-globules are freed from their
envelopes of connective tissue, milk is coagulated, and the casein is
dissolved."The tangible, practical object of this change is to form out of a
little-diffusible body (albumen) one easily diffusible (peptone), which
is capable of absorption through animal membrane in a higher degree
than ordinary albumen" (Ewald).Peptone is formed out of ordinary
albumen, as grape-sugar is formed out of starch, by taking up water; it
is therefore the hydrate of albumen.The more tardy the digestion in the stomach the more highly charged
with acid is the gastric juice.According to Wright, the degree of
alkalinity of the saliva is in proportion to the acidity of the stomach
fluids, and Bence Jones has observed that during the excretion of acid
in the stomach the total alkalinity of all alkaline digestive fluids is
increased.The lesson is thus learned that a too careful preparation of
food, so as to shorten and lessen gastric labor, diminishes the
activity of the gastric juice as well as that of all other digestive
fluids.Intestinal digestion begins when the softened mass passes through the
pylorus.This mass (chyme) is composed of (1) the products of gastric
digestion which have not been absorbed--peptone, dextrose, levulose,
peptonized gelatin, with mucus and gastric juice; (2) all matters which
have escaped digestion--the starch of vegetable substances, dissolved
gelatin and albumen which have not been peptonized, and some unaltered
muscle-structure; and (3) fat, fatty acids, and cellulose upon which
neither saliva nor gastric juice has had any influence (Ewald).This complex semi-fluid mass with an acid reaction enters the duodenum
and comes in contact with fluids and ferments destined to work
remarkable changes in its composition.The first of these fluids is the
bile, which is alkaline and composed of the glycocholate and
taurocholate of sodium, cholesterin, soaps, etc., phosphates and
carbonates of lime and sodium, chlorides of potassium and sodium,
bile-pigment, etc.The outflow of bile is excited by the contact of the
chyme with the orifice of the bile-duct.When the alkaline bile is
mingled with the acid mass in the duodenum, it neutralizes its acidity,
precipitates the peptones, and therefore stops all further action of
the gastric juice.Fats containing free fatty acids are emulsified,
soaps being formed by a combination of the alkalies of the bile with
the fatty acids.Lastly, bile hinders fermentation in the intestine and
acts as a purgative by exciting peristalsis.Absorption is probably
also favored by bile, as it has been found that emulsified fats pass
more readily through an animal membrane which has been wet with
bile.[3]

[Footnote 3: Ewald thinks this result is doubtful: in animals killed
during digestion he has found an acid reaction in the contents of the
intestine beyond the opening of the bile-duct, with no precipitation of
the albumen (_op.{622} As far as we now know, the function of the bile is to neutralize
the acidity of the duodenal contents, and thus pave the way for the
action of a digesting fluid of much greater potency and of much higher
function.[4]

[Footnote 4: In order still further to demonstrate the necessity of
bile-action as a preparation for pancreatic digestion, it may be
mentioned that in artificial experiments, with a heat equal to that of
the body, if antiseptics analogous to gastric juice and bile are not
used, there is a too rapid change from alkalinity to acidity, and
consequently all of the starch is not converted into sugar before it
develops lactic acid with putrefactive disorganization.A deficiency of
bile, therefore, is a cause of intestinal indigestion (Bartlett, _op.This fluid, the pancreatic juice, is composed of inorganic salts,
albuminoids, and certain specific ferments, and has an alkaline
reaction.It has a threefold operation upon the softened mass with
which it now comes in contact: 1.The starch of vegetable matter, which
has been only slightly acted on up to this time, is now rapidly
converted into grape-sugar by a peculiar diastatic ferment more active
than any other known ferment.Albuminous matters (proteids) which
have escaped digestion in the stomach are changed into a soluble and
absorbable pancreas--peptone.Trypsin is the active ferment in this
case (Kuhne), and it is only in alkaline or neutral solutions that the
albuminoids are readily dissolved.The necessity of neutralization by
the alkaline bile is thus demonstrated.A ferment distinct from the
others splits the fats into fatty acids and glycerin, and emulsifies
them so that they can be taken up by the lacteals lower down.Experiments made by mixing albuminates with pancreatic gland-extract,
under favorable conditions, show after a certain time the presence of
leucin, tyrosin, hypoxanthin, and asparaginic acid.In a feebly
alkaline or neutral solution a faint putrefactive odor is soon noticed,
with the development of bacteria; ammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen,
hydrogen, and carbonic acid--evidences of the putrefaction of
albumen--are also detected.It is difficult to tell when normal digestion in the intestines ends
and putrefaction begins.The conclusion is, that the normal action of
pancreatic juice (trypsin) gives origin to bodies met with in the
ordinary putrefaction of albumen.[5] This thin border-line between
normal intestinal digestion and the decomposition of the intestinal
contents has an important bearing on the facts of intestinal
indigestion.[Footnote 5: Ewald, _op.The intestinal juice performs a minor but independent part in
digestion.It converts albuminous matter into peptone, and hydrated
starch into sugar.Its function is therefore supplementary to that of
the gastric and pancreatic secretions.[6]

[Footnote 6: Ewald, _op.103; also, "The Functions of the
Intestinal Juice," Charles L. Dana, _Med.News_, Philada., July 15,
1882, p.When food enters the mouth the process of digestion begins, and all the
activities of the glands concerned in digestion are probably at once
set in motion.Mastication excites, by reflex action, pancreatic
secretion; the acid chyme touches the orifice of the common bile-duct
and stimulates the outflow of bile; the neutralized chyme next invites
pancreatic digestion.For the integrity of intestinal digestion it is
required that mastication and stomach digestion should be normally
performed.The intestinal movements which are so necessary to digestion by making
successive changes in the position of the intestinal contents are {623}
controlled by nervous arrangements, but may occur independently of the
central nervous system.The ganglia of Auerbach and of Meissner in the
intestinal wall are sufficient for the development of peristaltic
waves.The irritation of the mucous membrane by food, hyperaemia, and
the pouring out of digestive juices, and intestinal movements, are
parts of one process.Paralysis by section of the splanchnic leads to
hyperaemia of the intestinal vessels and increased peristalsis;
stimulation of the splanchnic causes anaemia of the intestinal wall and
arrest of movement.Local cold by producing anaemia brings about the
same result.The products of digestion as they pass toward the jejunum consist of
diffusible peptones, sugar, emulsified fats and oils, and substances
which have escaped digestion, as fragments of muscular fibre,
starch-corpuscles, connective tissue, hairs, or other foreign matters.The bowel contains also carbonic acid, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphuretted
hydrogen, and marsh gas.The mass, alkaline or neutral in the duodenum
and jejunum, becomes acid in the ileum from the putrefaction of albumen
and fermentation.The peptones and sugar pass by osmosis into the
blood-vessels of the portal system and thence to the liver.In the
liver the sugar is converted into glycogen (carbohydrate), and stored
in the liver-cells until needed for the maintenance of animal heat and
for the nutrition of the tissues.The peptones are used in part to
supply the nitrogenous waste of tissue, but much of the albuminoid
matter is broken up in the liver into glycogen and urea, the latter of
which is excreted by the kidneys as waste matter.The minute granules of oil in emulsion are taken up by the epithelial
cells covering the villi; thence they enter the adenoid tissue of the
villi on their way to the lymphatic radicles, the lacteals.From here
the passage is open to the underlying lymphatic vessels and to the
larger abdominal lymph-vessels and the thoracic duct beyond.Intestinal digestion is not completed and the body does not receive its
pabulum until the products of digestion have reached the liver and the
thoracic duct.ETIOLOGY.--It is usually said that intestinal dyspepsia is more common
in women than in men, but the contrary is the rule.Some of its most
common causes--over-eating and the eating of indigestible food--are
especially vices of men.It is more frequent between the ages of forty and fifty, but no age is
exempt.Infants at the breast, children of any age, adults, and old men
and women are alike subject to it.Men in middle life begin to suffer
from the imprudence and carelessness of youth and from the anxiety and
cares of business.The indulged children of rich parents and improperly
bottle-fed infants frequently suffer.Heredity and idiosyncrasy have a certain influence in determining the
prevalence of intestinal dyspepsia.The distaste for and inability to
digest vegetables, fruits, and fats are often peculiarities of family
history.The occurrence of cases in the same family is often explained
by improper food, bad cooking, and irregular hours, to the evil
influences of which all the members are similarly subjected.All conditions of the organism which result in a depraved or altered
blood-supply, as anaemia, primary and secondary rachitis, chronic
syphilis, and continued febrile diseases, are causes of intestinal
indigestion.{624} The connection of the indigestion of fats with the
strumous diathesis and with phthisis is undisputed.J. Hughes Bennett
traced the origin of phthisis to defective fat-digestion; strumous
indigestion and the indigestion of fat are synonymous terms.Debilitating influences, such as bad air, want of cleanliness and
outdoor exercise, impair functional activity in the intestines as
elsewhere.Sexual excesses, but especially masturbation, have a special
influence for evil in this direction.The influence of the mind upon the digestion of starch and fats is even
greater than upon gastric digestion, for no other reason perhaps than
that the former is a more complex function and less easily relieved
than the latter.Prolonged or excessive mental labor does not do so
much harm as mental worry, over-anxiety, and the strain and overwork of
business.Professional men--lawyers, physicians, and clergymen--who
become over-burdened with responsibilities, and who sympathize too much
with the distresses of others, are very prone to suffer.The careworn
face with lines about the mouth and forehead is one of the plainest
signs of duodenal defect.The proper secretion of the juices of the
intestine and normal peristalsis are impossible where brain and nerves
get no rest.The too rapid mental development of the children of the
present day is a fruitful source of weakened fat-and-starch digestion
and of impaired development.So long as children are sent to the public
school at four and six years of age, there will continue to grow up a
precocious race with active brains in feeble bodies.[7] This injurious
result is largely brought about by the direct interference of premature
brain-development with the complex intestinal processes of digestion
and absorption.[Footnote 7: In eight of the States and Territories the minimum age for
entering the public school is fixed at four years; in seventeen States
at five years; in the others, except two, at six years.The two notable
exceptions are Alabama and New Mexico, where children do not enter
school until the age of seven.]Wealth, with ease and inactivity, and sedentary occupations, contribute
to the same end by lessening the need of food, and thus debilitating
the organs of digestion by inaction.Sedentary pursuits, especially
those in which the body is bent forward and constricted or compressed
at the waist, interfere with active function in the intestine.This is
the case in tailors, shoemakers, etc.Tight-lacing in women and a too
tight trouser-band in men are injurious.Hot climates, especially when combined with dampness, lead to disorder
in the intestine and liver.This effect is most marked among persons
coming from colder climates, as among the English in India, who keep up
the habits of eating to which they have been accustomed at home.The
lessened demand destroys the appetite, and stimulants and condiments
are resorted to to whip up the inactive functions.The intestine is
loaded with a mass of crude, unaltered matter which can with difficulty
be disposed of.Chronic indigestion results, varied with acute attacks
of diarrhoea or dysentery.The portal system is filled with an excess
of albuminoid material which the liver is unable to store away.The
excess is got rid of by conversion into uric acid.Lithaemia and
chronic congestion and enlargement of the overloaded liver result, with
their many attendant evils.Over-eating occasions first gastric and then intestinal indigestion by
the {625} entrance of unaltered food into the duodenum.Eating without
hunger often involves the taking of food which the body does not need
and which the stomach cannot digest.Diners-out rarely go through a
season without one or more internal revolts.A too-varied diet, a
dinner of many dishes, is faulty in variety as well as in excess.On
the other hand, a too great sameness in diet and the prolonged use of
one or two articles of food which are not easy of digestion, and which
have a great deal of waste, fatigue and then disorder intestinal
digestion.This is a fault into which children are often allowed to
fall.Indigestible food and an excess of starchy or fatty food conduce to
disorder of duodenal digestion.In conditions of debility and anaemia
and in the convalescence of fevers the deficiency of saliva involves an
inability to digest starch in the mouth and points to a corresponding
want in the duodenal secretions.The improper use of alcoholic liquors,
taking them on an empty stomach between meals and in excess, tends to
direct irritation of the mucous tract.Condiments in large quantity
have the same effect.Irregularity in the hours of eating and a faulty distribution of the
amount of food disturb the perfect working of the mechanism of
digestion.Very light breakfasts and very late and large dinners are
injurious.The habit, now quite general in cities, of deferring the
breakfast proper until midday, leaves the system too long--fifteen to
sixteen hours--without proper food and weakens digestive activity.Intestinal indigestion is very common among Americans who have lived
abroad and adopted European customs.Another cause which is unfortunately very common is the imperfect
mastication and insalivation of food, due to too great haste in eating,
to defects in the teeth or gums, or to a deficiency of saliva.The
saliva no doubt sometimes possesses a feeble diastatic power, although
abundant in amount.Carnivorous animals bolt their food, but
vegetable-eaters must masticate.Slow mastication transforms starch
into sugar, and at the same time excites secretive activity in the
glands of the digestive tract, especially in the pancreas.The more
thoroughly this preliminary function is performed the better
preparation is there for the subsequent acts of digestion.[8]

[Footnote 8: "The familiar act of chewing is seldom a subject of
reflection, yet it throws into motion a more complicated system of
levers, accompanied by a drain of fluids from more curiously adapted
apparatus, than the arts can parallel" (Leared, _On Indigestion_,
London, 1863, p.The chewing of tobacco, a wretched habit which is much less common now
than formerly, and to a less extent the habit of smoking, are causes of
deficient, altered, or depraved saliva, and secondarily of altered
pancreatic secretion.The thin smoker grows fat when he abandons the
weed.The normal functions of the intestines are interfered with and
indigestion is set up by constipation.Every one has felt the activity
in digestion which accompanies the regular habit of defecation, and the
torpor and oppression which depend upon an unemptied colon."There is a
concert of action in virtue of which the whole muscular apparatus of
the digestive tube sympathizes with that of the large intestine.This
concert of action, which induces pathological states, is the reason why
in the {626} physiological state a regular contraction of the whole
intestinal tube, including the stomach, is the consequence of the
regular contraction of the large intestine."[9]

[Footnote 9: Trousseau, "Les Dyspepsies," _L'Union medicale_, tome xi.,
1857, p.An excess of acid in the stomach would enfeeble the solvent power of
the intestinal fluids by antagonizing neutralization by the alkaline
bile; the same effect follows any cause which prevents the outflow of
the bile, as the plugging of the common bile-duct by mucus and
epithelium in catarrh or by an impacted gall-stone.The emulsification
of fats is incomplete and decomposition in the intestine follows.The
antagonism of the saliva and the gastric juice, of the gastric juice
(or the chyme) and the bile, must preserve their delicate and nice
adjustment in order for digestion to be properly performed.Diseases of the pancreas seriously embarrass digestion in the
intestine.Lesions of this organ, as catarrh of the duct, cancer, fatty
degeneration, etc., may result in impaired emulsification of fats,
fatty diarrhoea, and wasting.Intestinal indigestion accompanies hyperaemia and catarrh of the
intestinal mucous membrane, diseases of the heart, lungs, and liver,
and all other causes which impede portal circulation.SYMPTOMS.--Intestinal indigestion cannot be so clearly pictured as that
of gastric dyspepsia.This is owing to the frequent concurrence of the
two conditions, the gastric symptoms taking precedence of the others.The more complex nature of the intestinal function is another reason,
intestinal indigestion having more modifications in its phenomena.In
the stomach there is only one active secretion; in the intestine there
are three, all participants in the act of solution.An alteration in
the quality or quantity of one of these--the bile, for example--would
lead to different symptomatic results than would follow another
defective secretion, as that of the pancreas, for instance.Clinical
study has not yet fully differentiated the forms of indigestion due to
these several deficiencies.But there are certain well-defined symptoms
associated with intestinal disorders which are distinguished by their
seat, time of their appearance, and their character from analogous
symptoms connected with the stomach.Intestinal indigestion may be acute or chronic.The latter is the more
typical and more common form.When a sudden attack of indigestion in the intestine results from the
entrance into the duodenum of food in such a state that it cannot be
digested, the result is the rapid development of pain, flatulence,
borborygmi, and frequently of fever, ending in diarrhoea, with the
escape perhaps of the offending matter: a condition then exists which
may be called acute or subacute intestinal catarrh or acute intestinal
indigestion.One name would be as correct as the other.Slight acute
forms are marked by a coated tongue, loss of appetite, headache, pains
in the limbs, distress in the epigastrium or right hypochondrium,
flatulence, and constipation.These might be accompanied by symptoms
indicating a disorder of the liver functions--light- stools,
slight jaundice, lithates in the urine.But intestinal indigestion
alone can cause these symptoms without the condition of so-called
biliousness being present.The local symptoms are due to the presence
in the intestine of an {627} imperfectly-altered mass and the
development of gas; some of the general symptoms are reflex; others, as
headache and lassitude and pain in the limbs, come from the absorption
into the blood of the gases, particularly sulphuretted hydrogen.The
participation of the stomach in acute attacks of this sort modifies the
symptoms as here described.Such attacks are apt to recur at intervals.If the causes which bring about acute disorder in the intestine are
allowed to continue, the intervals between the acute or subacute
attacks diminish, and there is in time a fixed state of chronic
intestinal dyspepsia in which the partly-altered food coming from the
stomach is not properly prepared for absorption.Instead of digestion
there is decomposition; the transition is easy from the one to the
other of these states.The symptoms connected in this case with the
digestive organs are pain, occurring from two to six hours after
eating, in the right hypochondrium, the epigastrium, or the umbilical
region, due to distension of the intestine with gas.This pain is dull,
not always fixed, lasts from one to three hours, and is accompanied by
tenderness on pressure over its seat.Tympanites, borborygmi, and a sensation of fulness in the abdomen
accompany the pain or may exist without it.Gaseous accumulations in
the intestine, the cause of these symptoms, have an independent source,
being produced by decomposition in the gut itself, and are not due to
the descent of gases from the stomach through the pylorus.What is a
physiological and temporary condition becomes in disease a distressing
symptom of long duration.In intestinal indigestion the gut is nearly
always inflated with gas, which in its movement produces rumbling
noises.In acute indigestion it is rapidly formed in large amount, and
by the stretching of the wall of the bowel and pressure on
nerve-filaments causes intense pain--colic.In the chronic form the
distension excites uneasy sensations, prevents sleep, and may be so
great as to cause dyspnoea by pushing the diaphragm upward.When the
small intestine is distended the greatest swelling may be about the
umbilicus, or the abdomen may be evenly rounded.When the colon is
chiefly or solely inflated, its outline across the upper part or at the
sides of the abdomen can be easily made out.It is produced by a loss of
contractility of the intestinal wall.The more direct causes are
over-distension of the gut and disturbance in the circulation and
innervation of its walls.The stools are hard and dry, and are expelled
with difficulty.Sometimes they are coated with shreds or films of
mucus, the product of a chronic catarrh of the mucous membrane of the
colon, or mucus from the small intestine is intimately mixed with the
mass.Diarrhoea may alternate with constipation.The passage of
unaltered food, as fragments of meat, vegetables, or fruit, clearly
shows the extent to which indigestion exists.By the microscope
particles of food which have escaped complete disintegration may be
detected.Very dark-green or black discharges
show an excess of bile; light-yellow or gray slate-, a
deficiency.Stools of the latter character are highly offensive in
odor.Hemorrhoids are often present, being due to the sluggish portal
circulation and to the pressure of hard fecal masses in the rectum.The
appetite is not impaired, as a rule, but it may be fitful or irregular.A bad {628} taste in the mouth, and a swollen, relaxed, and coated
tongue may exist without any decided gastric disease.The symptoms of disorder of the nervous system are more marked than in
gastric dyspepsia.This results not so much from the depressing
influences of pain as from the peculiar malnutrition of the
nerve-tissue.In order to have furnished to the blood the pabulum out
of which the nerve-elements are reconstructed the digestion of fat must
be normally performed.Lecithin, which is found conspicuously in the
brain and nerves, is a complex fat containing phosphorus and
nitrogen.[10] Anaemia and waste follow directly from interference with
the digestion and absorption of fats and starch in the intestine, but
the most delicate, the most easily-disorganized solid of the body, the
nerve-tissue, is the first to feel and to manifest its want of natural
supply.And so the dyspeptic whose intestine is at fault becomes
depressed in spirits, hypochondriacal, absorbed in the contemplation of
his sufferings, analyzing them and referring them to the most serious
organic changes.There are sleeplessness, disturbing dreams, the habit
of waking at a fixed hour, dizziness, uneasy sensations or pain in the
head, and disturbances of the special senses, as buzzing in the ears,
muscae volitantes, and attacks of blindness.Headache assumes often the
form of hemicrania; it may be in the forehead or about the eyes.Attacks of vertigo and sensations as if the ground were rising beneath
the feet accompany intestinal flatulence.Confusion of thought, loss of
the power of application, and mental inertia are frequent sources of
anxiety.Paralysis has been noted as following indigestion.Epileptiform convulsions and milder epileptic attacks can be traced to
undigested matter in the intestine.[11] Various modifications of
general sensibility also happen: there are pains in the back and limbs,
hyperaesthesia, and anaesthesia.An inaptitude for exertion, especially
for mental labor, forces the boy to give up school and college life.Successful careers are abandoned by men who at the cost of neglecting
all the rules of health have succeeded for a brief period in passing
their fellows in the race.Sudden attacks of fainting have been noted,
with very grave collapse.These are the effect upon the nervous centres
of the absorption of sulphuretted hydrogen which has been evolved in
large quantities in the intestine.[12] The daily occurrence of
vertiginous and other morbid sensations, with melancholia, may be due
to the daily toxic absorption of gas from the intestine.[Footnote 10: Fothergill, _Indigestion and Biliousness_, New York,
1881, p.[Footnote 11: Chambers, _The Indigestions_, London, 1867, pp.[Footnote 12: Tyrell, case of a man with eructations smelling of
sulphuretted hydrogen who had vertigo and sudden collapse; symptoms
relieved by purgative (_Pacific Med.Journ._, May, 1882, p.The action of the heart is disturbed as in stomach indigestion.Irritability of the heart and palpitation are in part due to anaemia
and in part to mechanical pressure and reflex influences.The nervous,
anaemic, thin dyspeptic has among his chief troubles a throbbing heart,
which keeps him awake at night and fixes his attention upon this organ
as the seat of his disease.The general circulation is languid; cold
hands and feet and cold sweats testify to this, and the irregularity or
suppression of catamenia follows upon the irregular blood-supply.The urine is usually high-, has an abnormally high density, is
acid, and on cooling deposits lithates, uric acid, and oxalate-of-lime
{629} crystals.The urine is most heavily loaded with sediment when
digestion has been recently completed.Therefore, the morning urine
after a heavy dinner of the night before contains the largest amount of
lithates.Albuminuria is occasionally a symptom of indigestion in the
bowel.The eating of cheese or pastry in excess may cause it.[13]
Seminal emissions at night frequently occur.The action and reaction
upon each other of this perversion of the sexual function, the
indigestion, and the mental disorder, reduce the poor sufferer to a
most pitiable condition of despondency and prostration.[14]

[Footnote 13: Warburton Begbie's _Works_, Sydenham Society's
Publications, 1882, p.[Footnote 14: The writer has observed cases in which an exaggeration of
the sexual instinct in men of middle age was associated with intestinal
indigestion.]Anaemia is one of the earliest indications of impaired nutrition.It
precedes loss of flesh and the wrinkled and dry condition of the skin
which may be a marked symptom in cases of long standing.Various
eruptions appear on the skin.In the strumous dyspepsia of children the
white, almost waxy, skin is covered with dry scales, which may be seen
over the whole body from head to foot.No symptom is more
characteristic of intestinal indigestion and of imperfect fat digestion
and absorption than this.Eczema and psoriasis, pityriasis, impetigo,
and porrigo decalvans are forms of skin eruption seen.Closely allied to the symptoms caused by indigestion in the intestine
are those due to functional disorder of the liver.The liver completes
the work which the intestine has begun.It receives directly from the
intestine blood laden with the products of digestion, and further
transforms them into substances to be used in the economy.The symptoms
which result from disturbances in the performance of these functions
are, as has been said, closely connected with the symptoms of
intestinal indigestion.This association is shown by the tendency among
older writers to trace all such symptoms to the liver, the terms
bilious and biliousness including all the phenomena of derangement of
the function of digestion in the intestine, as well of the function of
the liver.Later writers excluded the part of the liver to a great
extent in giving rise to the so-called bilious symptoms.Recent
physiological study has shown how closely the intestine and the liver
are associated in health and in disease.When the liver is implicated
in indigestion the symptoms which follow are due either to a deficiency
of the secretion of bile, and the resultant disturbance of digestion in
the intestine, or to a derangement in the transformation in the liver
of the products of albuminoid digestion.When the disorganization of
the peptones is imperfectly performed in the liver, instead of urea
there is a production of lithates and lithic acid, constituting the
condition called lithaemia.The lithates pass into the urine and are
deposited.The occurrence of this urinary sediment after excesses and
imprudences in diet is well known.The continuance of lithaemia leads
to the development of symptoms more or less characteristic.These are a
loss of appetite and coated tongue, flatulence, oppression after
eating, and constipation.The nervous system is soon disturbed, and
often to a marked extent.Vertigo, headache, disturbances of the
special senses, sleeplessness at night, drowsiness during the day,
annoy the patient and induce extreme hypochondria.He is worried,
moreover, with numbness and tingling in one or both arms or in the
{630} legs, and hence spring fears of paralysis.The heart is disturbed
in action, and is irregular and feeble.Emaciation in previously
corpulent persons is not unfrequent.COURSE, TERMINATION, AND SEQUELAE.--Acute dyspepsia in the bowel lasts
from a few hours to a day or two, and ends in leaving the patient as
well as before.A diarrhoea of indefinite duration may follow.Chronic intestinal indigestion in infants and young children often
continues until the diet is changed to one suited to the powers of
digestion.In adults interference with so important a function cannot
but have the most serious results.While the progress is slow, lasting
many years, there is a steady march from bad to worse.The character and conduct are so altered by the disease that a man may
be said to be just what his digestion makes him.Amiability under the
daily goad of intestinal dyspepsia is an impossibility.The
irreconcilables, the men out of joint with the world, are living
witnesses of the antagonism and disaffection within their intestines.The deterioration in health paves the way for many diseases, and there
is hardly an organ in the body which may not ultimately become the seat
of organic change.In the young, phthisis is frequently the ultimate result of the
malassimilation and malnutrition; in men beyond middle life
degenerative changes in the intestine, liver, and kidneys close the
series of morbid changes which began in the intestine.Thomas N.
Reynolds attributes bronchitis and phthisis in part to the local
influence of septic matter carried by the portal and lacteal vessels to
the lungs in cases of intestinal dyspepsia, with constipation and
septic fermentation of the ingesta.[15]

[Footnote 15: Paper read before section of Practical Medicine at
meeting of Am.In many cases business and professions are abandoned, and men become,
under the influence of despair and complete absorption in their
symptoms, intellectual and moral wrecks, burdens to themselves and to
all around them.In this stage the primary cause, the dyspepsia, is
lost in the exaggerated prominence of the nervous symptoms.DIAGNOSIS.--The acute variety is known by the seat of the abdominal
symptoms, the pain, distension, and movement of gas not being in the
stomach, but in the intestines.The pain is like colic; the abdomen is
sensitive to the touch; tympanites is general and may be very great.If
vomiting occurs, the symptoms continue after the stomach is empty.Diarrhoea may quickly come on, and is followed by relief.There is no sleep, but restlessness, and in children
delirium.In the chronic form the history of the case and the study of the causes
are of great value in formulating an opinion.The persistent abuse of
the pleasures of the table sooner or later develops intestinal
indigestion.Inquiry into the mode of life, hours of eating, manner of
eating, kinds of food taken, etc.The
teeth are defective, and mastication and insalivation are neglected.There is distress in the pit of the stomach or in the right
hypochondrium, beginning about two hours after eating and lasting from
four to six hours; intestinal distension with gas, either in the small
intestine or colon, with borborygmi and constipation, is generally
present.The nervous symptoms are characteristic: they are depression
of spirits, irritability, sleeplessness, vertigo, and {631} headache.The man is more completely altered mentally than in gastric dyspepsia.The urine contains lithates in excess; anaemia and emaciation progress
rapidly.Seminal emissions and weight and heaviness about the loins are
present.The following symptoms distinguish gastric dyspepsia, and do not occur
in intestinal indigestion unless the stomach is at the same time
involved: pain or weight in the epigastrium immediately after eating,
vomiting of unaltered food, of food in a state of acid fermentation,
eructations of ill-tasting or bad-smelling gas or of acid fluid,
water-brash, and heartburn.Loss of flesh may not take place to any
extent even in very bad forms.The diagnosis of differences in the forms of indigestion due to defects
in the pancreatic, biliary, or intestinal secretions is not at present
a matter of precise knowledge.A pancreatic indigestion would be
followed, it might be supposed invariably, by fatty stools; but such is
not the case, since degeneration of the pancreas and closure of the
duct have occurred without fatty evacuations from the bowels.[16]
Moreover, ulceration of the duodenum is followed sometimes by fat in
the stools.Still, if the symptoms of intestinal indigestion include
rapid wasting and fatty diarrhoea, we may conclude that the pancreas is
at fault.It may be seen as
oil-drops passed alone or with fecal matter, or as lumps of fat, pale
yellow and tallow-like.Glycosuria[17] bears some relation to
pancreatic diseases, and therefore may be an aid in diagnosis.[Footnote 16: Ewald, _op.95; D. S. Haldane, "Cancer of
Pancreas," _Edin.77; J. S.

Head of Pancreas," _ibid._, vol.[Footnote 17: Bright, "Cases and Observation connected with Diseases of
the Pancreas," _Med.-Chir.A deficient excretion of bile is indicated by a whitish or yellowish
coating of the tongue, with loss of appetite and bad taste in the
mouth.The stools are scanty, dry, slate- or white, and
offensive in smell.The patient is languid,
often irritable and hypochondriacal.He complains of headache, and is
dull and drowsy after eating.The heart's action is unsteady,
intermittent, or frequent.It is impossible to recognize indigestion
due solely to a deficiency of the intestinal juice or to feeble
peristalsis, granting that such forms exist.PROGNOSIS.--A fatal result does not follow directly from intestinal
indigestion.Its complications and results are frequently the causes of
death.Treated early and with decision, a cure can be expected.Everything depends upon the extent to which the patient submits to the
strict directions of his physician; his whole life must be made
subordinate to the plan of treatment.When the general health has become profoundly altered there is less
chance to do good.Discouraging symptoms are anaemia, debility,
coexisting gastric dyspepsia, an inherited hypochondriacal tendency, or
the strumous diathesis in children.When the disease has so far progressed that the patient is unable to
{632} rouse himself to the point of wishing to be well, only the most
severe measures directed to the control of an irresponsible person can
save him from ruin.In organic disease of the pancreas, intestine,
liver, or heart the result will depend upon the nature and curability
of the lesion.TREATMENT.--Acute intestinal indigestion due to the presence of
undigested food and gas in the intestine is treated by relieving
present distress and procuring a free movement from the bowels.A large
enema or a quick cathartic followed by an opiate--hypodermic injection
of morphia, paregoric, or other preparation--may give early relief.A
strict diet, warm poultices over the abdomen, and an anodyne may be
needed for several days after.The integrity of intestinal digestion depends upon the normal
performance of all the preceding stages of digestion.Perfect
insalivation, mastication, and gastric digestion are necessary to a
proper action of the intestinal juices.The first rule of treatment in
the chronic form is to examine into the condition of the mouth and
teeth--to insist upon a slow and thorough mastication of food,
especially of starchy food.Mastication is under the control of the
individual, and he refuses to exercise this salutary means of
prevention and cure at his own risk.The habit of chewing on both sides
should be cultivated.All habits which waste and weaken the saliva
should be given up, as smoking, chewing, and needless expectoration.Where the teeth are imperfect they should be attended to; false teeth
should replace absent ones.All means should be used for improving
gastric digestion: complete solution of food here means easier work for
the intestine, and sometimes the cure of intestinal indigestion by
removal of its cause.The rules which more directly bear upon the
subject of intestinal dyspepsia are these: All the causes which have
acted to bring about the disease should be removed.A change from a hot
climate to a cooler and dry one will sometimes have an immediate good
effect.Especially is this the case if travel is combined with change
of scene.The substitution of exercise for inertia, of fresh for
confined air, and the abandoning of occupations and habits of dress
which hinder the freedom of movement of the abdominal muscles are of
the highest importance.The patient should be made to cultivate
pleasure instead of work if his mind has been overtaxed in his
profession or business.Relaxation of the strained energies is
indispensable to recovery.This rule is as applicable to
school-children as it is to the overworked adult, man or woman.The
benefits of travel, with change of scene and air, cannot be
overestimated.Pedestrian tours in the mountains for young men, a trip
to Europe for men and women in middle life, will secure the best
results.For men who work much with their brains nothing is more
conducive to aiding intestinal digestion than manual labor in the
garden or workshop as a recreation.Exercise on horseback is
pleasurable and improves a sluggish abdominal circulation.Rowing is
good for younger men if it is confined to the field of pleasure, and is
not made a task.For very feeble persons, especially for women, massage
serves the purpose of exercise.The Swedish movement cure expands the
thorax and abdomen, hastens the circulation, and quickens all the
functions of nutrition and secretion.A course of treatment would be incomplete without suggestions as to
bathing.Life at the seashore would be of little service without the
daily plunge in the surf.Still salt-water bathing is better for
children and {633} delicate women.The reaction should be thorough to
secure the best results.It is much to be regretted that hydrotherapy
is not available and is not made use of more generally.A well-managed
establishment where appropriate regimen and good and sufficient food
could be combined with the renewal of the tissues by bathing would be
of great advantage in all forms of indigestion.Nearly all of the
benefit derived from the Hot Springs of Arkansas in chronic cachectic
diseases follows upon the immediate improvement of the digestion and
nutrition.The Warm and Hot Springs of Virginia have an equally good
effect upon torpid abdominal functions.The Russian bath, the very hot
bath, the cold plunge, the cold douche to the back or abdomen, and the
cold pack to the abdomen, are means which may be employed at home for
inducing a revolution ending in reform in the state of the digestive
organs.Irregularity in the hours of eating is of so much injury that rules
must be given to enforce uniform habits.Instead of the light breakfast
and heavy dinner, a good breakfast, a midday dinner, and a light tea
are to be preferred.It is of much value to regulate the appetite
according to the needs of the body and to avoid excess in everything.In this disease eating too little or starvation to a moderate degree
gives that rest to the intestine which is necessary to its restoration
to health.The selection of the food should not be left to the patient; the
dietary should be chosen for him with a view to lessening intestinal
labor.In general terms, this should consist of a moderate amount of
albuminoid food of the most digestible kind, and of farinaceous food
and fats in an acceptable and digestible form.In other words, as the
intestine digests proteids, starch, and fats, no exclusive diet can be
devised which will secure a perfect result.In each case the
examination of the stools and experience with different articles of
diet must be made the means for determining upon a suitable regimen.The exclusive milk diet is the best starting-point in feeding a patient
suffering from acute or chronic indigestion.In addition to the fact
that milk has all the elements of a perfect food, it contains sugar and
fat in the most favorable condition for absorption; the casein of milk
alone requires transformation into peptone.The pancreatic juice has
the greatest activity in its effect upon milk, as is easily
demonstrated by the artificial digestion of milk by pancreatic extract.In milk, therefore, we find a most easily digestible and most highly
nutritious food for such cases.Instead of milk with cream, skimmed
milk will be found sometimes to serve better the purpose of an
exclusive diet, because it has less fat and because larger quantities
can be taken without distaste or a sense of repletion.Koumiss may be
added to the milk diet; it is digestible, palatable, and nutritious.The peculiar and very active diastatic ferment of pancreatic juice
converts starch into sugar very readily.Farinaceous articles of diet
can be added to milk with advantage.Digestion takes place more slowly
and more thoroughly in consequence, and an additional article of
nutriment is obtained.Thus, milk can be diluted with a thick gruel of
barley or oatmeal, or some of the best of the various artificial foods
can be stirred in.To the milk diet may be added animal broths or soups
prepared with vegetables, animal jellies, or some of the ready-prepared
beef-essences.They may not in themselves be highly nutritious, but
they contain at least {634} the salts of meat, and act as stimulants to
the appetite and to the secreting glands.Such a rigid diet cannot be kept up for a very long time without
change; the appetite craves variety.Therefore solid albuminoid food in
small quantity may be added to milk and farinaceous diet.Sweetbread
boiled in milk, without dressing of any kind, is well suited for a
beginning of animal diet.Oysters for some palates make an agreeable
variety without putting much strain upon the digestive powers.They
should be eaten uncooked, as cooking in any way renders them less
digestible, and for greater precaution the hard part, or the adductor
muscle which serves to keep the two shells together, should be removed.Fish boiled or plainly cooked and eaten without sauce is very easily
digested.White-fleshed fish which has but little fat incorporated with
the muscle-fibre is to be preferred.The patient may have eggs uncooked
or slightly boiled, but one to two daily will be as much as he can well
digest.The meat of poultry and game, especially that from the wings
and breast, may be given even in a very feeble state of the digestive
organs.When a more solid or satisfying diet is craved the patient may
have beef or mutton cooked rare.Tripe and rabbit are suitable to some
cases.Bread, one day old and made light and porous, need not be denied the
patient.To many, well-made biscuits or
crackers are agreeable.Vegetables should be given in small quantities, as the intestine is
almost solely the seat of their digestion, and excess will tax too much
a function which should be allowed as much rest as possible.The green
vegetables contain less starch, and are therefore to be preferred.Lettuce, cabbage, kale, spinach, and celery come under this class, but
even these are to be given to patients under treatment in moderation,
with the intention of pleasing the palate rather than for purposes of
nutrition.Macaroni and rice are easily digested.Fruit contains very little nitrogenous matter and much water, and
therefore has but little nutritive value, but it may be given to
relieve the tedium of a restricted diet of milk or broths.Grapes,
oranges, figs, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and peaches are
the most digestible.Fruit-juices, especially if acid and fresh, are unobjectionable.Coffee
should not be allowed; its effect upon the nervous system is sufficient
objection to its use.Tea can be given diluted largely with milk;
cocoa, racahout, and broma are nutrient and make pleasant drinks.Sugar
need not be excluded if used sparingly, and butter and oil in
moderation may be permitted.If the stomach is not disturbed thereby, wine may be taken with food to
excite appetite.But except in the case of those who have always taken
it, and cannot do without it, it is better to dispense with alcohol
altogether.A red wine well diluted with water is a pleasant addition
to the meal.Old wine is to be preferred to new, as being softer and
less alcoholic.Good pure American wine from California or Virginia
will answer the purpose when reliable French wine cannot be secured.The value of mineral waters in the treatment of indigestion is great,
but without proper dietetic regimen they can accomplish but little.The
good results following a visit to Saratoga, Bedford, or other
watering-place are due to other causes than the waters.In combination,
however, {635} with the advantages of change of scene, air, good hours,
and a simple diet the mineral waters aid in bringing about a cure.They
are especially useful in men who drink too little water at home, in
gouty and plethoric subjects, and in states of acid stomach digestion
and chronic constipation.The alkaline and saline waters are the best,
the former containing a notable proportion of the carbonate or
bicarbonate of sodium, potassium, or lithium--the latter having neutral
salts in considerable quantity.The articles of food to be avoided are pastry, cheese, much butter or
fat, meat richly dressed or over-cooked, pork, veal, lobsters, crabs,
vegetable matter in excess, very cold or very hot fluids or solids.All of the methods so far described are designed to accelerate the
circulation in the abdominal organs and in the tissues generally, to
quicken the secretory and nutritive processes, and to give to the
intestinal secretions the foods which they can most readily digest.In
the event of such means failing to accomplish the desired end, is there
any direct stimulus which can be brought to bear on the intestinal
glands concerned in digestion?The pancreas being the most active and
most important of these, it would be desirable to have some agent which
could excite its gland-structure to greater activity.Sulphuric ether
has been found to have this effect; it may be given before meals.The
salivary secretion begins pancreatic digestion (the digestion of
starch), and therefore its outflow should be stimulated at the same
time; but thorough mastication does this usually without need of
further aid.When all plans fail to secure a thorough digestion in the intestine,
and unaltered food and fat are passed, while the patient grows thinner
and feebler daily, artificially-digested food may be given.The
intestine is thus relieved of labor, and time is given for a
restoration of activity by rest and an improved tone of all the tissues
and organs.Rice, bread, baked flour, potatoes, or barley may be given
in combination with malt extract, which converts starch into
grape-sugar and dextrin.As pancreatic juice acts both upon proteids and starch, an extract of
the pancreas has a more general application than an extract of the
stomach--pepsin.Roberts of Manchester has given full directions for
the method of digesting food by pancreatic extract.Beef, milk, and the
farinacea may be digested, the albuminoid substances being changed into
peptones, the starchy matters into dextrin and sugar, capable of being
absorbed readily with but little or no further alteration in the
digestive tract.[18] Pancreatic emulsion (Dobell) is another method of
giving fat emulsified.[Footnote 18: Fresh pancreatic extract is made by cutting into small
pieces the pancreas of the pig (which is the best), the ox, or sheep.The pancreas of the calf yields an extract which acts only on
albuminous substances, but not on starchy matters.The divided pieces
of the pancreas, well freed from fat, are put in a well-corked,
wide-mouthed bottle with four times their weight of dilute alcohol (one
part of rectified spirit to three parts of water).The mixture should
be agitated once daily: at the end of a week the mixture is filtered
through paper until it is clear.A well-made liquid extract of pancreas
is made and sold by Metcalfe of Boston, and a solid extract by
Fairchild Bros.No doubt improvements will be
made in the processes of manufacture of these extracts, and better
results will in time be obtained from their use.]A less successful way of gaining the same object is by administering
the pancreatic extract internally.The difficulty lies in conveying the
extract (the ferment of which is destroyed by the acid gastric juice)
through the stomach in safety.This chemical danger is thought to be
obviated by giving the extract one to two hours after eating with a
{636} protecting guard of an alkali, the bicarbonate of sodium; but the
mechanical difficulty of securing direct transit through the stomach to
the intestine early enough and in quantity enough to digest the
duodenal contents is as great as the chemical obstacle.It is very
doubtful whether this method of use can be of any real service.In those cases in which the form of indigestion is due to, or is
associated with, a deficient hepatic secretion--a condition indicated
by offensive and light- stools and other symptoms--it is
advisable to stimulate the liver to increased secretion.It is probable
that the same remedies which excite a flow of bile do at the same time
stimulate the pancreas.The best of these are euonymin, sanguinarin,
iridin, ipecacuanha, colocynth, jalap, podophyllin, sodium sulphate,
and potassium sulphate.Sodium benzoate, ammonium benzoate, and the
salicylate of sodium are also powerful hepatic stimulants.As one of
the purposes of the bile is to create the alkaline medium necessary for
pancreatic digestion, the administration of an alkaline[19] solution in
full doses, as in the form of mineral water, when gastric digestion is
finished, may make amends for the lack of bile.A combination of an
antiseptic and the alkali may to some extent supply the deficiency
still better, as the bile is the antiseptic of the intestinal canal.[Footnote 19: The waters of Ems, Vichy (Grande Ville or Hopital
Springs), Vals, or Bilin may be used for this purpose.]Atony of the intestinal wall leads to flatulence, colics, and
constipation, and would be a cause of indigestion if none other
existed.It is to be treated by the general rules already given, by
electrical stimulation of the abdominal muscles with the faradic
current, or by the effort to stimulate the intestinal wall more
effectively with the galvanic current.Strychnia in small doses should
be given for some time.In women of relaxed muscular fibre with
enlarged abdomens an elastic belt may be worn with advantage.After the special aids to the parts concerned in digestion, tonics are
called for to combat the general want of tone and anaemia.The
saccharated iron, the carbonate, potassio-tartrate, lactate,
pyrophosphate, or the ferrum redactum may be given.The syrup of the
iodide of iron is the best form for children.The bitter tonics are
inadvisable except for loss of appetite in cases where the stomach is
not disordered.Quinia is available in a large number of cases in which
malarial influence plays a part.Strychnia is a good general tonic, and
may be prescribed combined with mineral acids, particularly with the
dilute hydrochloric acid.The special symptoms which call for treatment are flatulence, abdominal
pains, and constipation.All the remedies already described are
directed toward their relief.But sometimes they appear in so
exaggerated a form as to need immediate attention.The many remedies
for colic and tympanitic distension which have the property of
relieving spasm and absorbing gas find application in these conditions.Constipation is not to be treated by laxatives if it can be avoided.But the bitter waters, Friedrichshall, Pullna, Hunyadi Janos, and
Rakoczy, by exciting bile outflow, are sometimes of undoubted curative
value.The form of dyspepsia called strumous, as it occurs in children of
anaemic appearance with dry skin covered with minute scales, and with
bad breath and light ill-smelling stools, demands a very thorough and
{637} persevering treatment.The advantages of climate must be
sought--seashore in summer with bathing, dry and moderately warm air in
winter.Outdoor life in the sun, with active exercise, is to be had at
the expense of education within-doors.Study is not good for children
of this class except when health is made paramount to it.Cod-liver
oil, either pure, in phosphatic emulsion, or in the pancreatic
emulsion, is a necessity.Malt extract with the hypophosphites is
beneficial.The food must be carefully selected, and the child educated
to a varied diet, including fats.The skin should be anointed daily
with cocoanut oil, olive, cottonseed oil, or cod-liver oil.{638}

the working of an involuntary mechanism which may be set in play by the
will, and is in part dominated by it, but which is frequently
independent and uncontrolled by volition.Deep inspiration, closure of
the glottis, downward pressure of the diaphragm, and contraction of the
abdominal muscles are accessory, but not essential, to the expulsion of
feces from the rectum.In certain persons, and occasionally in all
persons, especially in diseases where the fecal mass is in a semi-fluid
or fluid form, the strongest effort of the will cannot resist the
expulsive contractions of the rectal muscle.The sphincter is kept in a
state of tonic contraction by a nervous centre situated in the lumbar
portion of the spinal cord.The fecal mass, supported by the bladder
and the rectum, does not at first touch the sphincter; the rectum is
usually empty; but when the column has been well driven into the rectum
peristaltic action is excited in the rectal walls and the sphincter is
firmly pressed upon.The lumbar sphincter centre is now inhibited, and
the ring of muscle opens, the accessory and voluntary muscles contract,
and the expulsive act is completed.In the well-ordered and healthy
individual the rectal walls and the sphincter do not receive the
maximum of irritation from pressure of the advancing column but once in
twenty-four hours.The habit of having one movement in each day is, it
may be believed, in accordance with the natural and physiological
demand, although both the number and the hours of evacuating are fixed
to a great extent by education.The habit once established, the
mechanism of expulsion recurs at the same hour and entirely without the
direction of the will.If the desire be resisted, it will be most apt
not to return until the same hour on the next day.Defecation depends for its normal character upon the healthy
functioning of the organism, but especially upon the normal processes
of digestion.The character of the rectal contents as to composition
and consistence, and the time of the arrival of the mass at the
sphincter, are {639} regulated by the taking of food at stated hours
and by its normal digestion and absorption.Unaltered or partly-changed
remains of the ingesta pass down the bowel, mingling with the secretion
from the intestinal glands and with mucus and epithelium.As this mass
passes into and through the colon, being propelled by regular
peristaltic waves, it acquires odor from the development of a substance
which is a final product of the putrefaction of albumen.[1] Gradually
the more fluid elements are absorbed, and in the descending colon a
less fluid or semi-solid consistence of the feces is reached.A healthy
digestion and assimilation, with active and regular contractile
movements of the muscular walls of the small and large intestines, are
essential to normal defecation.[Footnote 1: Ewald, _Lectures on Digestion_, New York, 1881, p.Constipation may be defined to be that condition in which there is a
prolonged retention of the feces or in which they are habitually
expelled with difficulty or in insufficient quantity.[2] While there
are individual peculiarities due to habit or nature, the custom with
most persons of having one movement in the twenty-four hours would
cause any longer retention of the rectal contents to be considered
constipation.The limits between health and disease are not well
defined, and a failure to evacuate the bowels for several days need not
be considered pathological nor require medical interference.In persons
otherwise in good health such an occurrence due to neglect, change of
habit or diet, as in travelling, would cause no interruption to health
or comfort.Nature brings relief sooner or later and re-establishes
order and regularity.In many cases constipation is a primary disease
and the cause of many secondary disturbances, but it is often the
effect or the symptom of various acute and chronic diseases.[Footnote 2: Cases of constipation due to mechanical obstruction from
changes in the wall of the intestine or to exterior pressure will not
be considered in this article.]In long-continued constipation the intestinal contents are so retarded
in their progression along the canal that they undergo a too early and
too complete absorption of their fluid portion.In time there are an
accumulation and impaction of dry fecal masses in the rectum, sigmoid
flexure, descending transverse colon, or caecum.An obstacle is thus
created which may ultimately close the tube entirely and cause
intestinal obstruction.It
is the effect of loss of peristaltic force and of a diminution of
sensibility in the lower bowel, and is associated with general
functional inactivity and with muscular degeneration and obesity.Infants are more subject to constipation than children of one year and
over.In many instances this is due to artificial feeding with cow's
milk, condensed milk, and the patent foods so largely used, or with any
diet unsuited to the digestive organs.Imperfect digestion of casein or
other food, the filling of the bowel with a dry mass difficult to
propel, and the consequent catarrhal state of the mucous membrane, are
causes of both constipation and diarrhoea.Feeble, delicate children
with imperfect muscular development, and children born rachitic,
scrofulous, or syphilitic, are generally constipated.Women are prone to constipation much more than men.False modesty,
which imposes restraint upon young girls, and their ignorance {640} of
the necessity of regularity, their habits of indoor life, and avoidance
of exercise, are largely the causes of this.But the anatomical
structure and physiological life of the woman offer another
explanation.At every menstrual period the uterus enlarges and
exercises a greater compression upon the rectum.A tender and enlarged
ovary (and at the menstrual epoch the ovary is always tender and
enlarged) exercises an inhibiting action upon the muscles which bring
the feces in contact with it in their downward passage.In the married
woman recurring pregnancies lead to the habit of constipation from the
long-continued pressure upon the colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum,
from the extreme stretching of the abdominal muscles, and from the
paralyzing effect of compression during labor.The relaxed condition of
the pelvic and abdominal organs after labor offers no resistance to the
distension of the rectum and sigmoid flexure.The cessation of the
catamenia is accompanied with constipation, nervousness, and a feeling
of ill-defined apprehension when the bowels are moved, or abdominal
pains deter many persons, chiefly women, from habits of regularity.All
uterine and ovarian derangements by mechanical or reflex means bring
about the same result.Chlorosis and anaemia in girls are almost
invariably associated with constipation.Hereditary influence shows itself very markedly in the tendency to
constipation which is seen in many members of the same family.This is
probably more often apparent than real, and is the result of neglect of
the proper attention to the wants of children and of the perpetuation
of vicious habits of taking purgatives.The habits of life and the occupation of the individual have much to
do with the causation of constipation.Those who lead active outdoor
lives are generally regular in their daily movements, but persons of
sedentary pursuits or who work in constrained attitudes--lawyers,
clerks, tailors, shoemakers, and seamstresses--are predisposed to
constipation.Intellectual work, not only from the muscular inactivity
which it entails, but from the diversion of energy to the
nerve-centres, develops the constipated habit as well as indigestion.Men who are overworked in business, employes in banks, government
offices, shops, etc., bring on the habit from the hurry incident to
their occupations.Luxurious and enervating habits of life, over-eating
and sloth, with the over-indulgence in alcohol and tobacco, have the
same effect.All the influences which deteriorate health, such as bad
ventilation and over-heating of rooms, foul air, want of cleanliness of
the person, indigestible food, imperfect mastication, tight-lacing in
women, compression of the abdominal organs in men, can be said to share
in bringing it about.Servants, especially women, are constipated more
frequently than their masters.This is due to ignorance and neglect,
and sometimes to excessive tea-drinking and irregularity in eating.Neglect to establish or continue a habit of daily regularity in
defecation leads to the accumulation in the rectum of masses of feces.Resisting the desire to empty the bowel interrupts the necessary reflex
acts, and finally the muscular excitability and response to the
presence of feces are entirely wanting.The continued contact of fecal
matter with the mucous membrane wears out its susceptibility; the
over-distension of the rectum enfeebles the power of its muscular wall,
as is the case when all hollow muscular organs--stomach, heart,
bladder--are overstretched.Thus a {641} neglect to answer the demand
for a daily movement and the failure to completely empty the rectum
will gradually develop constipation in a person who has before been
perfectly well regulated.In childhood failure to teach and to insist
upon good habits is the cause of much of the trouble of after-life.Acute and chronic diseases of the brain and spinal cord bring about
constipation.Meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis, senile dementia
and softening, have it as a symptom at some time or other.In
encephalitis and myelitis there is an interruption of motor
nerve-currents.In meningitis and tetanus the muscular walls of the
bowel and the abdominal muscles are in a state of tonic contraction.The use of aperients is an important agent in developing the
constipated habit by over-stimulating and wearing out muscular
activity.The idea that a daily movement is a necessity, and that an
occasional purgative is useful in relieving the system of morbid matter
which would otherwise induce disease, is the chief source of this
hurtful custom.The traditional meaning attached to the term
biliousness implied the resort to cathartics for its relief, and it is
much to be regretted that with our more advanced knowledge the effort
should be made to revive the use of this term, which was wellnigh
abandoned.More ignorance and erroneous treatment has hung upon the
theory of biliousness than upon any other doctrine of medicine within
the past thirty years: it is well for physicians to condemn it and to
resist its reintroduction into scientific phraseology.[3] If the term
bilious as applied to diseases were abandoned, much good would come of
it.The general use of purgative mineral waters has added to this evil.Among the better classes these waters play the same part as the liver
regulators and vegetable pills do among laborers and servant-maids.Both gratify the innate love for self-medication by a resort to
cathartics for the slightest ailment.At first the injurious effects
are not apparent, but in time the reflex function is not brought into
activity except by artificial aids.The intestinal and rectal muscles
must be whipped into action, their normal contractile power being lost.[Footnote 3: For an excellent and dispassionate statement of the
reasons for abandoning the theory of the influences of bile as a cause
of disease, and the use of the term bilious, consult _The Bile,
Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, by J. Wickham Legg, chaps.The Hippocratic and Galenical belief has been transmitted with
but little alteration through Stoll, Andrie, Abernethy, and Copland to
the writers of to-day on biliousness.]Certain vegetable and mineral substances taken either intentionally
or by accident constipate the bowels.Chief among these stand opium and
its preparations.All opium-eaters are constipated.Lead which is
accidentally taken into the system by workers in metals, painters, etc.The use of tobacco in
excess has the effect of deranging digestion and causing constipation
in many persons, but this result is occasional only.Chronic diseases of the lungs and heart, by enfeebling the muscular
movements which take part in defecation, as well as by the general
feebleness and the chronic intestinal catarrh and indigestion which
they create, are causes of constipation.Chronic diseases of the liver,
especially cirrhosis, are also causes.Constipation accompanies
obesity, for in very fat persons the abdominal walls have but little
power of contraction; the {642} muscle-layer is thin and flaccid.There
is also in such persons in advanced life an accumulation of fat in the
mesentery and around the colon.The muscle of the bowel is in a state
of fatty degeneration, and atony and dilatation of the gut follow.Painful affections about the rectum and anus deter persons from
yielding to the desire for defecation.Fissure of the anus is the
principal one of these, but fistula, hemorrhoids, and local eczema have
a similar influence.A simple rigidity or spasmodic stricture of the
anal sphincter creates constipation.[4]

[Footnote 4: Kunemann, _De la Constipation compliques de Contraction du
Sphincter anal, et de son Traitement par la Dilatation de l'Anus_,
Paris, 1851.]Constipation is a symptom in chronic cachexiae and wasting
diseases, in the convalescence of acute exhausting illness, as typhoid
fever and pneumonia, or in persons bedridden from any cause.Defective
nutrition and degeneration of the muscle-fibre of the intestine explain
these cases.In some of them, with improved nutrition, regeneration
takes place with a return of contractility.Disorders of the digestive system have constipation as a
consequence and a symptom.The reflex sympathy between the movements of
the stomach and of the intestines brings this about in gastric
diseases.[5] It occurs in gastric cancer and ulcer, in acute and
chronic gastritis, in dilatation of the stomach, and in pyloric
stricture.The small amount of ingesta entering the duodenum in these
diseases diminishes the bulk of fecal matter.In acute intestinal
catarrh diarrhoea is the rule, but the bowels may be constipated in
intense inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membrane, as is often
the case in typhoid fever.In chronic intestinal catarrh constipation
is more common in the mild forms than diarrhoea.The thickening and
irritation of the mucous membrane lead to a diminution of reflex
excitability and loss of elasticity and contractility in the muscular
coat.Hence, except in cases where the inflammation is low down or
where ulcers have formed, constipation is a more frequent symptom than
diarrhoea.The alteration in the quantity and character of the
intestinal secretions in chronic catarrh is stated to be an important
element.Mucus, which is the chief product
of this condition, leads to indigestion and fermentation of the
intestinal contents and to increased irritation of the mucous membrane.The evolved gas distends the bowel and weakens its contractile power.The fecal mass when it reaches the rectum has an excess of mucus within
it or around it which makes its expulsion more difficult.But the
diminution or absence of bile does not constipate.In simple jaundice
diarrhoea is not uncommon, and an excess of bile does not of necessity
cause diarrhoea.[6]

[Footnote 5: Leube, in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.[Footnote 6: Legg, _op.The effects of the modifications of the pancreatic secretion are not
well known.Pancreatitis is attended by constipation.Fatty diarrhoea
is believed to follow occlusion of the pancreatic duct by pancreatic
calculi and chronic catarrh of the duct.Peristalsis is lost in
peritonitis from the muscular coat being infiltrated with serum and
paralyzed, but tuberculous peritonitis is frequently accompanied by
diarrhoea.Loss of fluids by abundant perspiration, by diuresis, diabetes and
lactation, increases the dryness of the bowel contents and hinders free
{643} evacuations.This is observed as a result of the arrival in a
tropical climate and in very hot weather in any climate.The profuse
sweats accompanying phthisis, acute rheumatism, intermittent fever, and
unusual exercise cause constipation.Another explanation which applies
to this has been offered by Good and Eberle, who ascribe constipation
to the excessive action of the absorbents in the small intestine, by
which the fluid portion is too rapidly and too thoroughly removed.[7]
Exercise by promoting activity of the functions in general may induce
constipation in this way.In spermatorrhoea the stools are infrequent.An insufficient amount of water taken with food is another cause.[Footnote 7: Dick, _Braithwaite's Retrospect_, xvii.Food which has but little waste to be got rid of--as milk or
beef--leaves a small residuum to be propelled along the intestine, and
therefore in one sense is constipating.Insufficient food acts in the
same way.An indigestible diet in excess, especially vegetable food, a
large part of which is insoluble, constipates by filling the bowel with
matter which cannot be got rid of, and chronic catarrh results.The
stones and seeds of fruits, as cherry- and plum-stones, raspberry- and
currant-seeds, husks of corn and oats, produce acute or chronic
constipation with serious symptoms.Intestinal worms (generally
lumbricoids) when in large numbers cause obstruction of the bowel;[8]
and various foreign substances taken by caprice or to take the place of
food have produced the same result: among these stick cinnamon,[9]
sawdust,[10] and clay (among the clay-eaters of the South) have been
mentioned.Magnesia, insoluble pills, and other medicines sometimes
form concretions in the bowel.Enteroliths and accidental concretions
form in the intestinal canal and are sources of obstruction.Any
foreign body is a nucleus around which concentric layers of phosphate
of lime are deposited, and thus a hard calculus is formed.Gall-stones
may pass into the canal and there accumulate in such numbers as to
interfere with the passage of the fecal matter.[Footnote 8: Copland, _Medical Repository_, vol.[Footnote 9: Ware, _Boston Med.and Surgical Journal_, 1858, vol.[Footnote 10: Bonney, _ibid._, 1859, vol.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--In cases where constipation has lasted many
years no alteration of the parts involved may be found.When lesions do
occur the pathological anatomy includes changes in the position,[11]
calibre, and in the walls and contents of the intestines.The most
common displacement is that of the transverse colon, which is depressed
in its centre; the acute angle of the descending part may reach as far
down as the hypogastrium.The caecum sometimes lies in the centre of
the abdomen.Dislocations of the intestines are congenital, due to
anomalies of intra-uterine development, in which case they become
causes of death in newly-born children from obstruction, or if
insufficient to cause death they establish habitual and incurable
constipation; or constipation may bring about displacement by the
greater weight of a portion of the bowel constantly loaded with fecal
matter.[Footnote 11: Votsch, _Koprostase_, Erlangen, 1874.]The sigmoid flexure is usually the seat of the greatest dilatation; its
expansion may be a cause or a consequence of constipation.[12] It may
reach a maximum of distension when it fills the entire abdominal
cavity, compressing all the abdominal organs and pushing the stomach,
liver, {644} and intestines into the thorax.In a case of this kind the
circumference of the dilated part was twenty-seven inches.[13] The
descending colon may be distended with the sigmoid flexure, or the
whole colon may be dilated from the upper part of the rectum to the
caecum;[14] the same thing happens rarely in the small intestine.In
one case, in which there was an accumulation of feces in the sigmoid
flexure, the large intestine presented itself as two immense cylinders
lying side by side, extending from the epigastrium to the pelvis.[15]
Each was about five and a half inches in diameter, and together they
filled the abdominal cavity.The circumference of the stretched colon
varies from ten to thirty inches.Pouches forming little rounded tumors
are seen on the outer surface of the colon; they are sometimes hernial
protrusions of the mucous membrane through the muscular coat (Wilks and
Moxon), or if large they are dilatations of the pouches of the
colon.[16]

[Footnote 12: Trastour, "De la Dilatation passive de l'Iliaque, et de
ses consequences," _Journal de Med.de l'Ouest_, 1878-79, tome xii.[Footnote 13: Dupleix, _Le Progres medicale_, Paris, 1877, tome v. p.[Footnote 14: Peacock, "Fatal Constipation, with Excessive Dilatation
of the Colon," _Tr.[Footnote 15: Lewitt, _Chicago Med.[Footnote 16: Gay, "Sacculated Colon, Prolonged Constipation," _Tr.But little weight can be
attached to this anomaly, as there is a difference in the length of the
colon in different nations and individuals, depending upon the
character of the food, being longer in those who eat largely of
vegetable food.[17]

[Footnote 17: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.The mucous membrane is normal or hyperaemic, or is in various stages of
chronic catarrh.Proctitis may exist with follicular ulcers; ulcers
form in the caecum, sigmoid flexure, and in the bends of the colon;
perforations and peritonitis rarely occur.Chronic peritonitis has
resulted from the stretching of the bowel from retained and hardened
feces; adhesions may form which ultimately cause death by obstructing
the canal.The walls of the intestines are in long-standing cases much
thinned.There are many reasons to believe that fatty degeneration of
the smooth muscular fibre takes place, in consequence of which it loses
its contractile power and atrophies.This lesion is most common in
advanced life, and accompanies fatty accumulation and degeneration
elsewhere.Its results would be constipation, distension of the bowel
with gas, and sometimes symptoms of intestinal obstruction.[18] A
thinned and dilated bowel may easily be lacerated under unusual
stimulation, as from a purgative.In a case recently seen by the writer
such an accident, rupture of the colon and death from peritonitis,
occurred from the effects of an active purge taken to bring on
abortion.Hypertrophy of the wall, especially of the muscular coat,
coexists with dilatation, and is most common in the upper part of the
rectum and sigmoid flexure.It is caused by overwork in expelling fecal
accumulations.The walls never become as much thickened as in
constipation from organic stricture.[Footnote 18: Cases are recorded of death with symptoms of intestinal
obstruction in which no lesion was found beyond a dilated colon; as,
for example, in _British Medical Journal_, April, 1879, p.Collections of fecal matter may be found in any portion of the colon,
but more frequently in the rectum, sigmoid flexure, descending or {645}
transverse colon, or caecum.They lie within the intestinal tube,
partly or wholly occluding it, or within lateral pouches, forming
tumors which are sometimes quite large.In this last form there is no
obstacle to the free passage of feces along the canal.Fecal
accumulations occur as small round, oval, or irregularly-shaped lumps
(scybalae), and are often covered with layers of transparent semi-fluid
mucus, puriform mucus, or mucus in filaments.The small concretions
vary in density; they may be so hard as to resist the knife, and may be
mistaken for gall-stones; larger masses, semi-solid or solid, are most
commonly seen in the rectum and sigmoid flexure.Here the collection
may reach an immense size.In one case fifteen quarts of semi-solid,
greenish- fecal matter were removed at the autopsy.[19] In two
other cases the weight of the feces found in the bowel was thirteen and
a half[20] and twenty-six pounds[21] respectively.The whole colon from
the anus to the caecum may be filled with such a mass, as in a case
mentioned by Bristowe, where the colon "was completely full of
semi-solid olive-green  feces.The small intestines were also
considerably distended,... and were filled throughout with semi-fluid
olive-green contents."[22]

[Footnote 19: Peacock, _Tr.[Footnote 20: Lamazurier, _Archives generales_, Paris, 1824, t. iv.[Footnote 21: Chelius, _Heidelberg Med.[Footnote 22: Bristowe, "Diseases of Intestines and Peritoneum,"
_Wood's Library_, New York, 1879, p.The color of these collections is black, reddish, deep green, or
yellow.In composition the scybalae, concretions, and larger masses
consist of fecal matter, with unaltered vegetable fibre; they may be
composed partly of skins of grapes, cherry-stones, biliary calculi,
hair, woody fibre, magnesia, or other foreign substances.Where fecal
concretions long remain in the intestine they acquire a hardness like
stone, and can with the microscope only be distinguished from mineral
matter.[23] Hemorrhoidal tumors, anal fissures, perirectal abscesses,
fistulae communicating externally or with the gut, are found in
connection with constipation.Abscess of the iliac fossa has been
observed in the same relationship.[24]

[Footnote 23: A remarkable case is recorded (_Dictionnaire de
Medecine_, Paris, 1834, t. viii.435) in which an ulcerating cancer
of the fundus of the uterus had opened communication and formed
adhesions with the small intestine, from whence the feces passed into
the uterus and out through the vagina.The large intestine, totally
occluded, contained petrified fecal matter.][Footnote 24: Richet, "Abscess of Iliac Fossa," _Revue de Therapeutique
medico-chirurgicale_, 1876, p.SYMPTOMS.--In persons who have a daily movement an occasional
interruption of two to four days may take place without local or
general signs of inconvenience.It is often asserted by patients that
one day's omission induces suffering, and recourse is immediately had
to laxatives.This may be justified sometimes, but in the majority of
cases no actual suffering follows a very rare and short
constipation.[25] If, however, symptoms do occur after a constipation
of one to three days, there is a sense of fulness and heat about the
rectum which is greater after stool; when the bowels are moved, it is
with effort (provided that no enema or purgative has been taken), and
the bulk of the expelled mass is much greater {646} than usual, being
moulded and hardened from its longer retention in the rectum.The
margins of the anus are tender, and the unsatisfied feeling after stool
is due to distension of the hemorrhoidal veins and oedema of the
tissues around them--a condition which ends in painful or bleeding
hemorrhoids.There are signs of impaired digestion, loss of appetite, a
coated tongue, oppression after eating and flatulence, and distension
of the abdomen.Headache is apt to be present, with flushing of the
face and general discomfort or irritability of temper.These phenomena
may all disappear within two or three days by a spontaneous stool or by
the use of a purgative.[Footnote 25: Some interesting remarks in connection with the idea that
constipation is not necessarily hurtful, and is in some cases
beneficial, may be found in a pamphlet by C. I. Harris, _Is our
Physiology of the Large Intestine correct, and is Constipation in
certain cases as Injurious as is supposed?_ London, 1878.]Acute symptoms of a violent nature are sometimes developed in persons
who have been constipated a long or short time, in consequence of
attempts at purgation or from the accumulation of indigestible food.Violent paroxysmal pains in the abdomen and efforts at stool are soon
followed by symptoms of intestinal obstruction and serious collapse.Quick relief follows a free movement from the bowels obtained by an
enema, or if not so relieved the case may terminate fatally.A frequent recurrence of fecal retention from the causes mentioned will
in time develop the constipated habit.Distension of the rectum
increases its capacity and destroys its sensibility and expulsive
power.The colon above the point of stoppage is distended with gas and
weakened.The bowels are rarely moved spontaneously, and finally are
never emptied without artificial aid.The literature of medicine
contains many extraordinary records of prolonged fecal retention,
ranging from a few weeks to many months.[26]

they should be; they are passed in masses of various sizes, and in
color are brown, black, dark-green, or yellow.Sometimes a coating of
mucus is on the outside, and sometimes streaks of blood, or there is an
intimate admixture of mucus, giving a slimy, gelatinous appearance to
the mass.Semi-digested food, as partly-altered milk, meat, or
vegetable matter, is seen, and quite frequently there is an
intercurrent diarrhoea which alternates with costiveness.The local symptoms about the pelvis and anal opening and in the lower
extremities come from the pressure of accumulations of feces.Thus,
compression of the iliac veins delays circulation in the lower
extremities; cold feet or oedema of the feet and ankles and varicose
veins follow.If the pressure is on the ilio-hypogastric and
ilio-inguinal nerves, there are neuralgic pains in the groin and over
the crest of the ilium.The sciatic and crural nerves may be the seats
of pain.Varicocele is the effect of weight upon the spermatic veins.Erections and seminal emissions in men follow pressure on the pubic
veins and prostatic portion of the urethra.Retention of urine also may
come from the latter cause.If the kidneys and ureters are compressed
by fecal tumors in the descending or transverse {647} colon, nephritic
pain, albuminuria, or retraction of the testicle, with delay in the
escape of urine, may happen.Icterus and its consequences are owing to
pressure on the common bile-duct; the liver and other organs may be
displaced and the aortic circulation obstructed by fecal compression.In women the retention of fecal matter in the rectum is the source of
special symptoms; it contributes largely to the occurrence of cervical
anti-flexion in the soft, pliable, growing uterus of girlhood (Thomas),
and unites with retroversion in women who have borne children to
produce great suffering.An unnatural state of the digestive system, as a cause or result, is
the invariable accompaniment of chronic constipation.The appetite is
wanting; the tongue is coated, and may be pale, soft, and indented by
the teeth.Distress follows eating; the abdomen is distended with gas
and is hard; all the evidences of gastric or intestinal indigestion may
be found.Nutrition is imperfect, as is shown in loss of flesh and in
the signs of functional disorder to be next described.The nervous system is soon deranged; sleep is unrefreshing, restless,
and disturbed by dreams.There are headache and mental and physical
indolence.The patient speaks of being giddy, faint, and nervous.Disturbance of vision (muscae volitantes), of hearing (tinnitus
aurium), and alarming attacks of dyspnoea and cardialgia may occur.[27]
Heart-palpitations and profuse perspirations are the effect of
excitement or effort of any kind.Chilliness or violent chills can be
traced to this cause also.In women hysteria, disturbed menses,
anaemia, and chlorosis accompany constipation.[Footnote 27: C. C. Melhose, _Hufeland's Journal_, 1841, xcii., Stuch
iv.Nervous symptoms are very common in the young, and it is doubtful
whether they are consequences of constipation or whether they form a
part of a general state of malnutrition and anaemia.Hypochondria is
undoubtedly closely connected with the constipated habit, and the
failure to secure a daily movement becomes the subject of unceasing
thought and anxiety.Hallucinations and sudden loss of consciousness,
aphasia,[28] and delirium, have been found to depend upon fecal
accumulation.[29] The absorption of fluids and gases from
too-long-retained and decomposing feces may explain such cases.The
nerve-centres soon show the effect of the supply of altered or
contaminated blood.[30] It is probable that the marked nervous symptoms
are more due to this cause than to reflex influences.[Footnote 28: Mattei, "Aphasia cured by relieving Constipation," _Bull.[Footnote 29: Pulitzer, _Wien.Presse_, 1866, x. p.42, with sleeplessness, hypochondriasis, hallucinations, and
one attack of sudden loss of consciousness; symptoms relieved by
removing a large quantity of fetid fecal matter from bowels.Also

(_Bulletin de Therap._, Paris, t.[Footnote 30: Bell, _Lancet_, London, 1880, i.A coincidence exists between dislocation of the colon and various
states of mental disturbance.Ten cases of suicide were seen by Votsch
in which there were displacements of the colon.Laudenberger of
Stuttgart found that in ninety-four autopsies of insane persons there
were anomalies of position of the transverse colon in one-seventh of
the number (Votsch).Fever is not infrequently due to constipation.During the course of
typhoid and other fevers an unusual elevation of temperature is often
{648} traced to a neglect to have the bowels emptied.But very high
temperature sometimes depends upon constipation alone, and is at once
reduced by removing the cause.This may occur in the course of chronic
diseases or in health, especially in children.[31] The temperature
rises from normal to 104 degrees F., and even higher, and immediately
drops to normal when the bowels are moved.When a sudden rise in
temperature comes with acute constipation, the influence must be a
reflected one from the mucous surface to the heat-centre.[Footnote 31: F. Barnes, "On the Pyrexial Effects of Constipation,"

_Boston Med.The urine is dark- and scanty, loaded often with urates, or it
may be limpid and of a very low specific gravity.The escape from the
bladder and through the ureters may be obstructed by compression, as
already mentioned.Suppression of urine has occurred, and been relieved
by removing large fecal collections.[32] In women catamenial
irregularity and dysuria are generally associated with constipation.Disturbances in pelvic circulation and local pressure of a distended
rectum explain these conditions.[Footnote 32: Barnwell, _Cincin.Had no movement for five days; suffered with
tympanites; severe pain in right iliac region, with persistent
vomiting; tumor in same region; complete suppression of urine.At the
end fifth day passed large quantity of apple-peelings and fecal matter.Return of flow of urine; passed two gallons in ten hours.]The skin is often parched, sallow, and is sometimes covered with
eruptions, as acne, psoriasis, eczema, erythema, or prurigo.Injuries,
wounds, and cracks of the skin heal slowly.RESULTS AND COMPLICATIONS.--The lateral pouches of the colon, most
commonly at the sigmoid flexure, become distended, and deeper pouches
are formed, where fecal matter is retained.[33] This need not interfere
with the regular daily movements.Fecal tumors are thus formed, the
nature of which is often not recognized.The colon may be distended so
as to fill a large part of the abdomen.The pressure of hardened feces
brings about ulceration of the mucous membrane, perforation and
extravasation of the contents into the abdominal cavity, with fatal
peritonitis.Abscesses in the perirectal tissues, with fistulae,[34]
anal fissures, hemorrhoids, prolapse of the rectum, varices of the
prostate gland and bladder, owe their origin to fecal collections,
especially in advanced life.Times and Gazette_, 1856, vol.[Footnote 34: Bannerot, C., _Du Phlegmon pelvi-rectal inferieure et de
la Fistule de l'Anus consecutive causees par la Constipation_, Paris,
1880.]Intussusception has been attributed to the weight of a mass of feces.Typhlitis and perityphlitis may come from retention in the caecum.Pressure upon the viscera brings about derangements in their functions,
many of which have already been described.From straining at stool a
hernia, haemoptysis, or cerebral hemorrhage may happen.Cases have been
reported of death from rupture of an aneurism of the aorta while at
stool, and J. F. Hartigan met with a case of spontaneous rupture of the
aorta, where the vessel was apparently but little diseased, occurring
in a man aged sixty during the act of defecation.[35]

[Footnote 35: Hartigan, _Tr.See also same number for a valuable paper on
spontaneous rupture of aorta, by J. J.{649} The effects upon the general system are those connected with
malnutrition.The health may be profoundly altered and death occur from
secondary diseases.Many general symptoms are due to the retention in
the blood of excrementitious matters or to their reabsorption.[36]

DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of constipation is not difficult except in
hysterical women, who select this as one of their subjects of
deception.Primary must be distinguished from secondary constipation,
the last being a symptom of some general or local disease.The history
of the case and the predominating symptoms will be guides to a
decision, but constipation should be regarded as a symptom until it is
proved to be otherwise.The tendency is to look upon it and to treat it
as a distinct malady; important organic changes elsewhere may thus be
overlooked.Simple habitual constipation may be mistaken for
constipation due to lesions in the wall of the intestine or to closure
from the external pressure of tumors.Slowly-developed symptoms of obstruction may come from polypoid growths
or benign tumors in the rectum, colon, caecum, duodenum, and ileum.The diagnosis can only be made
when the growth is in the rectum or when the tumor is expelled from the
bowel.Cancerous obstruction is accompanied by cachectic changes, by
the presence of an abdominal or rectal tumor, the passage of blood and
mucus, and violent rectal or abdominal pain.Primary cancer in the
small intestine appears in the form of lymphoma; it readily ulcerates,
and rather widens than narrows the channel of the bowel.[37]

[Footnote 37: Wilks and Moxon, _Path.Anat._, Philada., 1875, p.Stricture of the bowel is most commonly found low down in the rectum or
sigmoid flexure, within reach of the finger or exploring bougie.If
high up, it can only be diagnosed by exclusion and by its slow
progression from bad to worse.Syphilis or dysentery has nearly always
preceded the development of stricture.Tumors in the abdomen or pelvis compress the colon, and while they are
small they may be overlooked; sooner or later they grow so as to be
recognized.The presence of gall-stones as obstructions may not be detected until
they are passed.The previous occurrence of attacks of hepatic colic,
followed by jaundice, gives rise to the suspicion that gall-stones are
in the intestine if they have been carefully looked for in the stool
but never found.[38] Enteroliths give no indication by which they could
be known to be in the bowel.[Footnote 38: In a case seen by the author three separate attacks of
typhlitis occurred in a young woman suffering from chronic
constipation.After the last attack she passed from the bowel several
dark, irregularly-shaped concretions.The largest of these was a
gall-stone covered with fecal matter.Since this time--two years
ago--there has been no recurrence of inflammation and the constipation
is much better.]All forms of constipation from organic modification of the walls grow
worse and have no remissions; some rapidly progress toward a fatal
termination.Simple constipation is subject to improvement and relapses
due to the character of the food, climate, exercise, etc.Stercoral tumors may be known by their position and character as {650}
ascertained by physical examinations and by their history.They are
found in the iliac, lumbar, or hypochondric regions, and sometimes in
other parts of the abdomen.The most common seat is in the sigmoid
flexure and descending colon.They are nodulated, movable, painless,
can be made to change shape or are indented by pressure, and have a
doughy feel.Exploration of the rectum, by detecting impaction, will
make the diagnosis clear when the obstruction is low down.The
distension of the abdomen above the point of obstruction is limited at
first to the region of the colon; but if the colon is much dilated with
gas or is displaced, the enlargement becomes more central and more
general.On percussion the sound is of a dull tympanitic quality, and
never absolutely dull even in cases of great fecal accumulation.[39]

[Footnote 39: Case referred to by Guttmann (_Physical Diagnosis_,
Sydenham ed., p.360), in which the sound was dull tympanitic over two
large fecal tumors which weighed when removed at the post-mortem six
kilogrammes (sixteen pounds).]Fecal tumors[40] are preceded by habitual constipation, and are most
common in elderly people; they are changed in position and size or made
to disappear by cathartics or rectal injections.Persistent treatment
will bring away scybalae which by their color and consistence show that
they have long been in the canal.But the free movement of the bowels
and the non-disappearance of the tumors are no proof that they are not
fecal.[Footnote 40: _Tumeurs stercorales_, Paris, Thesis No.Fecal accumulations have been mistaken for ovarian tumors,[41]
cancerous tumors of the mesentery, uterine fibroids, and retro-uterine
haematocele.Fecal tumors in the transverse colon have been taken for
enlargement of the liver and spleen.In one instance obstruction of the
bowel from fecal impaction was supposed to be a strangulated gut in a
patient suffering from hernia: an operation was performed, the patient
dying in sixteen hours afterward.[42] Ovarian tumors in their early
stages are sometimes thought to be fecal.[43]

[Footnote 41: Jas.Times and Gazette_, London, 1859,
vol.[Footnote 42: Thomas Bryant, _Med.[Footnote 43: J. B. Brown, _Lancet_, London, 1850, vol.Fecal impaction in the rectum, with ulceration and bloody and mucous
stools, may for a time be called cancerous ulceration.Sacculated
scybalae cannot be distinguished from submucous tumors even by the hand
pressing on them in the rectum.[44]

[Footnote 44: H. R. Storer, _Gynaecological Journ._, 1869, vol.The history of each individual case, a full knowledge of etiological
factors, and a careful physical examination will in most instances lead
to a proper diagnosis.PROGNOSIS.--The result of treatment depends upon the age.Although in
infancy constipation is very common, cure is the usual result where a
mixed diet begins to be taken in childhood.At from one to fourteen
years of age regular movements can usually be secured, unless there is
a radical defect in the organization of the child.In young girls at
puberty and after, if constipation once is established it is apt to
become inveterate, associated as it is with imperfect development and
with uterine displacements.In middle life in men the result depends
upon the cause and upon attention to the physician's counsel.If
intestinal catarrh or atony is the cause, a persistent subordination of
the life of the individual to the object in view will generally end in
cure.In women who have borne {651} children the hope of relief depends
upon the duration of the malady before treatment.It is a dispiriting
task to attack a constipation of many years' standing in women with
relaxed abdomens, uterine prolapsus or retroversion, and general
debility.In old age the causes are generally such as cannot be
removed.The bowels can be moved when the occasions demand, but there
is very little expectation of establishing a spontaneous habit of
regular fecal movements.At every age and from whatever cause perseverance and hope on the part
of the patient and doctor are the chief elements of success.In
neglected cases the worst results may happen: dilatation of the colon,
ulceration, fecal impaction and obstruction, perforation; or in milder
cases chronic indigestion, hypochondria, etc.TREATMENT.--The physician can render great service by giving to parents
advice which will prevent constipation in children.He should insist
upon the importance of habits of regularity in defecation.At the
period of puberty in young girls this is of even greater moment, and no
opportunity should be lost for pointing out the danger of neglect.As a
prophylactic measure in adults counsel should be given suited to the
occupation.To persons leading sedentary lives the necessity of
exercise ought to be made clear.In the trades little can be done, but
in the case of literary men and those who read or write for many hours
prevention is easier than cure.Daily exercise, walking or riding,
frequent bathing with active sponging and friction of the surface,
especially over the abdomen, will be of much service.Avoiding
constrained positions where pressure is brought to bear upon the
abdomen, as in bending forward to write, is quite an important item.Among ignorant people advice of this kind is rarely attended to, but
even here the doctrine of regularity should never cease to be preached.Active business-men, especially young men, need emphatic teaching.They
cannot plead ignorance for the habitual and persistent neglect of the
simplest rules of health of which they are in this country so often
guilty.The symptoms of indigestion which are precursors of
constipation should receive due attention, and a mode of life and
dietary suited to a complete digestion of the food will favor the
timely and proper expulsion of waste matter.Acute constipation in a previously healthy person, lasting for one to
three days, does better without interference.No harm attends temporary
inaction of the bowel, and if a spontaneous stool takes place at the
end of this time it is a sign of a healthful and vigorous condition.The habitual clearing out
of the bowel by a purgative pill or dose of mineral water whenever such
a state of matters occurs creates the necessity for the interference.The man who never lets himself go over a day without an action is
miserable if he misses his purgative and its effects.In the onset of acute diseases the custom of giving a preliminary
purgative is generally unnecessary, often injurious.It disturbs the
rest which such cases need; it produces exhaustion in some diseases, as
pneumonia, pleurisy, and rheumatism; it irritates the mucous membrane
when irritation involves danger, as in intestinal catarrh and typhoid
fever.When it is desirable to empty the bowel in acute constipation a
warm-water enema for adults and children is the best means.When a
laxative is necessary in case of a failure of the enema, one mild in
its operation {652} should be chosen--a compound rhubarb pill, one to
five grains of calomel, a teaspoonful of Rochelle salts, or half a
bottle to a bottle of the solution of the citrate of magnesia or the
tartro-citrate of sodium.For children calomel, in doses of one-third
of a grain to one grain, is one of the most certain and least
objectionable.One grain of powdered rhubarb can be added to this for a
more active effect.Under such circumstances as a blocking up of the bowel with a mass of
partially digested or undigested food, fruit-stones, skins, or other
foreign bodies, where the symptoms are violent pain, tympanites, and
vomiting, the best method is to give large enemata of warm water
through a long rectal tube passed as high up as possible, and to
administer calomel in doses of one to three grains, repeated every two
to three hours until the bowels are moved.Cold can be applied to the
abdomen to diminish tympanites and prevent inflammation.Should the
constipation not yield and the pain, vomiting, and tympanites augment,
the case will then be considered one of intestinal obstruction, and be
treated as such.When called upon to treat chronic constipation, the physician should
remember that it is not the symptom, but its causes, to which he should
direct attention.Constipation is so often a symptom, a complication,
of other diseased states that its management is a matter of secondary
importance.Moreover, its causes are so peculiar to the individual and
depend upon so many variable habits of life that each case asks for
special study.The cure is only to be found by learning the particular
cause--the habit of neglect, hurried eating, the use of aperients,
uterine displacement, or any of the many causes enumerated.The digestion and all that concerns it is of primary importance, and to
it attention should be at once directed.The stomach and intestinal
digestion should be examined separately, and the relative power to
digest different articles of food determined.A diet, then, should be
selected, not with a view to correcting the constipation, but as to its
suitability to the digestive capacity of the patient.No system of diet
can be fixed upon as suited to every case: the aim is to secure normal
digestion and absorption and normal peristalsis.Many trials may have
to be made before a proper dietary can be chosen.When there is
indigestion of fats and malnutrition, with pale offensive stools
containing much mucus, an exclusive nitrogenous and easily digestible
diet--such as is advised in the article on INTESTINAL
INDIGESTION--should be prescribed.In constipation connected with
membranous enteritis a similar system of diet is proper.The drugs
given should be those which aid intestinal digestion, and reference
must be made again to this subject, already treated of.Many cases of
constipation can only be cured by this treatment; the routine treatment
by purgatives and a diet of vegetables and fruits would aggravate and
not relieve.A course of exclusive milk or skim-milk diet, if
persevered in for some weeks, will cure cases of constipation of this
kind without the use of laxatives.Of course a purgative must sometimes
be given if enemata fail, but the least irritating one should be
selected.The mineral waters best suited to constipation depending upon
intestinal catarrh are in this country those of the Rockbridge Alum
Springs and Capon Springs (Va.), the California Seltzer Springs, and
the milder {653} waters of Saratoga.The most suitable from Europe are
the waters of Apollinaris, Vichy, Buda, Vals, Ems, Salzbrunn, Selters,
Mt.The warm baths of Virginia (Warm Springs, Hot
Springs) are useful in increasing the activity of the skin and in
giving relief to the catarrhal state.A month spent at the Warm
Springs, with a daily bath the natural heat of which is 98 degrees,
will work a complete transformation in the abdominal circulation.This
should be conjoined, of course, with a properly-regulated diet and
exercise.Another month spent at the Rockbridge Alum Springs will
complete the restoration of the bowel to a normal state.It is much to
be regretted that the really valuable mineral springs of Virginia lack
so many of the comforts which the invalid requires.In cases where it
is more convenient a stay at the Arkansas Hot Springs is to be
suggested, and for obstinate cases of intestinal catarrh with sluggish
circulation, obesity, and gouty tendencies these springs are to be
preferred.A season at some of the mineral baths of Europe, as
Aix-la-Chapelle, followed by the strict regimen of the grape cure (as
at Bingen, Durkheim, Vevay, Montreux, or Meran), is a rational mode of
treatment which offers an almost certain prospect of cure.If the case is one of atony of the colon due to impaction of the rectum
and dilatation of the rectum and colon, without gastric or intestinal
indigestion, a quite different regimen is required.The constitution
and mode of life are the guides to the general plan to be followed.Sedentary pursuits are to be given up as far as possible.Long
vacations and travel must be insisted on, with active exercise by
walking and riding; also cold bathing or sponging, with brisk friction
of the whole body.Sea-bathing is useful both as an exercise and for
the effect upon the sluggish peripheral circulation, but the slothful
life at the seashore, with over-indulgence in eating and drinking, is a
source of more harm than good.Warm baths, and cold douches to the
abdomen, compresses of cold water or of alcohol, the cold douche to the
spine while in the hot bath, are all beneficial.Massage for women,
children, and feeble persons takes the place of exercise.The kneading
of the muscles over the abdomen can be combined advantageously with an
effort to accelerate the passage of the contents of the colon by
manipulation in the direction of movement.The interrupted electrical current, used for the purpose of developing
the feeble abdominal muscles, is a source of much advantage.[45] But to
be of service it should be persevered in for months, the patient
himself making the application under the direction of the physician.In
addition, the introduction of one insulated electrode into the rectum,
while the other is in contact with the abdominal muscles or along the
line of the large intestine, has been advised.The Swedish movement
cure may be a useful aid in some cases.The movements exercise the
muscles of expulsion.These are deep inspiration, flexion and extension
of thighs or trunk, twisting the trunk, pressure on the abdomen and
colon, stroking in the direction of fecal movement.[Footnote 45: S. T. Stern, "Die faradische Behandlung der Obstipation
und der nervosen Enteropathie," _Centralblatt fur Newenheil_, 5 Jahrg.,
Mai, 1882, p.201; also, I. Althaus, "Treatment of Obstinate
Constipation by Faradization of the Bowel," _Lancet_, London, 1867, ii.In the relaxed condition of the abdomen in women who have borne {654}
children or in old persons the wearing of an abdominal support
sometimes gives help and comfort.The best diet for cases of atony of the colon and rectum is one which
is easily digested and has a moderate amount of waste, as a full colon
will stimulate muscular action.Various articles are suggested with a
view to excite peristalsis by irritation of the mucous surface, but as
such substances are in themselves insoluble and innutritious, it is
unwise to resort to them.The following list includes the foods
suitable to such cases: Fresh vegetables, as spinach, raw or stewed
tomatoes, lettuce, kale, salsify, peas, asparagus, kohlrabi, and other
summer vegetables; in winter canned vegetables, if well prepared, take
their place.Among fruits, fresh fruit in general, especially grapes,
peaches, and oranges; dried fruit, as figs, raisins in small quantity,
stewed prunes, and baked or stewed apples, can be tried.Too much vegetable matter is harmful, as the bowel is filled with an
excess of waste, much of which is undigested food; the quantity must be
regulated by the appearance of the stools and by the success of the
regimen.If the blockade continues obstinately, the vegetable diet
should be reduced.The microscope in many cases can alone decide the
amount of undigested vegetable matter.Meats are all advisable in
moderation.The least digestible, as ham and veal, are to be avoided.Graham-flour bread, brown bread, or bran bread are better than bread
made of the best bolted flour.The first is more digestible, and bran
bread[46] is thought to increase peristalsis, but this is a doubtful
effect.Oatmeal well boiled, fine hominy, corn meal, or cracked wheat
with milk are pleasant and digestible.A cup of cafe au lait at
breakfast or before breakfast is the best morning drink;[47] it has a
laxative influence.Milk at
breakfast answers well for those who take it with relish.An orange on
rising in the morning is a pleasant remedy.[Footnote 46: "The Efficacy of Bran Bread in relieving Despondency...
dependent on an Irregular and Constipated State of the Bowels," _Journ.Sci._, London, 1858-59, v.[Footnote 47: "Treatment by Cafe au Lait," _Gaz.des Medecins prat._,
1840, No.Certain drugs are called for to aid these measures in giving tone
directly or indirectly to the weakened bowel muscles.Strychnia stands
first, but it woefully disappoints one who trusts much in the
theoretical arguments for its use.In fact, it may be said of all drugs
given for constipation that they stand in a very subordinate rank to
the measures already discussed.They should be thought of last, not
first, and but little confidence should be put in the vaunted value of
new drugs.Strychnia can be combined in anaemia and debility with the
dried sulphate or carbonate of iron, and with quinia or arsenic,[48] or
in feeble digestion with dilute hydrochloric acid and pepsin.Belladonna was advised by Trousseau as a stimulant to unstriped
muscular fibre, and it can well be given with strychnia; ipecacuanha
and atropia are approved of in conjunction.[49] A pill of ergot,
belladonna, and strychnia would answer the indication of a feeble
peristalsis.DaCosta has suggested giving one drop {655} of the fluid
extract of belladonna with compound tincture of gentian or cinchona
three times daily after meals.The sulphate or valerianate of zinc,
oxide of zinc, extract of valerian or gentian, capsicum, or black
pepper can be tried in pill form with belladonna and strychnia.[Footnote 48: Bartholow thinks arsenic overcomes constipation when due
to deficient secretion and dryness of the feces (_Mat.Med._, New York,
1879, p.[Footnote 49: Legros and Onimus, _Journal de l'Anat.et de la Phys._,
t. vi.Ringer says one grain of ipecacuanha taken while
fasting each morning will relieve constipation from torpor
(_Therapeutics_, New York, 1882, p.These remedies are slow-acting, and in the mean while the bowels must
be moved artificially, methodically, and taught to act at stated hours.For this purpose a small enema of cool or cold water at the same hour
every day after breakfast does well.It is irrational to distend the
bowel, already weakened by distension, with large enemata of warm
water.Recourse should not be had to this until all hopes of effecting
a cure are gone, or only as an occasional remedy in impacted
accumulations where the mass must be softened before it can be removed.If the enema does not in time empty the colon sufficiently, laxatives
will have to be taken with some regularity until the habit is created.A tumblerful of water with or without a teaspoonful of salt, or a
tumblerful of any alkaline water charged with carbonic acid, taken on
rising in the morning, may prove effective.A tablespoonful of sweet
oil at night acts well as a lubricator and softens the feces.If these
more simple means fail, it becomes unfortunately necessary to give a
purgative drug: any one of this class can be combined with strychnia,
belladonna, vegetable tonics, and iron.Those to be preferred are
aloes, colocynth,[50] and podophyllin.The compound podophyllin pill or
a pill of one-sixth of a grain of belladonna and podophyllin at night
or three times daily, the pill of aloes and myrrh, or the Lady Webster
pill, are well-approved forms of administration.A compound rhubarb
pill acts well if taken after dinner.[Footnote 50: A few drops of the Prussian tincture of colocynth several
times daily is advised by Ringer (_Therapeutics_, New York, 1882, p.If one desires to select a purgative which will probably increase the
outflow of bile, selection can be made from the following drugs:
podophyllin, aloes, rhubarb, colchicum, euonymin, colocynth, calomel,
jalap, sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate, cream of tartar; and among
the rarer alkaloids iridin, sanguinarin, physostigma, and juglandin.These, according to Rutherford, Vignal, and Dodds, increase the
secretion of bile in fasting animals.Ox-gall and pig-gall are
laxatives only; they have no effect on the liver, but can be added to
other purgatives in pill forms.Salines largely diluted may be given to strong adults: Epsom or
Rochelle salts quite early in the morning, a solution of sulphate of
magnesia with dilute sulphuric acid, to which dried sulphate of iron
may be added, are quite popular; and of the bitter waters, Hunyadi
Janos, Friedrichshall, or Pullna water serves the purpose.One grain of
sulphate of quinia added to a saline will increase its effect.The
milder laxative waters are to be preferred to the bitter waters.The
Saratoga waters, Congress, Geyser, Hathorn, answer the purpose taken
early in the morning, or among the European springs those of Kissengen,
Plombieres, Marienbad, Homburg, Seltzer, or Leamington in England, are
not too active in their effects.In atonic constipation, the form now
under consideration, the laxative chalybeate waters are indicated where
there is anaemia or debility.These are represented by the Columbian,
Pavilion, Eureka, and Excelsior Rock among the Saratoga waters, and by
the Bedford Springs water.{656} It is well to administer a number of drugs in rotation in
habitual constipation, as the susceptibility to a particular drug is
lost after continued use.Increase of the dose is the usual method to
offset this result, but it is irrational to meet exhaustion by
over-stimulation.Rest of the part stimulated by using a remedy which
brings about the result in a different way is the wiser course.The
dose should be gradually reduced, tempting the bowel to act more and
more without aid.Among the laxatives which can be borne in mind in
alternating treatment the following list includes some which can be
used with advantage: the fluid extracts of rhamnus (buckthorn) and
cascara sagrada; alum, which is called for in certain forms of atony;
sulphur in the form of confection or sulphur with guaiacum[51] (half a
drachm of each in powder at night); the wine of colchicum (five drops
or more three times daily), advantageously used in gouty or rheumatic
persons; the infusion or tincture of euonymus; the tincture of benzoin;
senna in fluid extract and in the compound powder of liquorice.[Footnote 51: Fuller, _Lancet_, London, April 23, 1864, p.Infants and children should be cured of constipation without purgatives
if possible.Attention to the diet of the infant, and close inspection
of the stools to see the effect of the food given, will guide to a
proper system of feeding.Breast-milk is the best remedy; next, a food
which most nearly resembles mother's milk--cow's milk properly diluted
with barley-water, oatmeal-water, or rice-water--stands first.Condensed milk, given in barley- or oatmeal-water, is a second and
excellent substitute in cities.Antacids prevent a too rapid
coagulation of the casein and the formation of curdy lumps.Lime-water
with milk or bicarbonate of potassium or of sodium may be administered
with the food or before it.The quantity of food must be lessened until
the child can digest all it takes.The infant should be taught to empty the bowel at the same hour daily
by always placing it at this hour in a position favorable to and
suggestive of defecation.Dilating the sphincter at the same time with
the soap suppository or the small end of a Davidson's syringe, or just
touching the margins of the anus, will excite the necessary reflex
movement.If defecation is painful, examine the inner edge of the anus
for small cracks or for eczema ani.[52] Over-stretching the sphincter
with the finger in cases of rigid or spasmodic contractions will
sometimes produce permanent relief.[Footnote 52: Betz, "Eczematous Proctitis," _Memorabilien_, iv., Dec.In children the question of diet is equally important.Most cases of
constipation in them originate in intestinal catarrh from improper diet
and over-feeding.Strict rules of diet should be rigidly enforced, and
each case receive special study in order to determine upon the best
dietary.The minutest details of the child's life, its habits and
surroundings, are to be controlled so as to secure the best possible
influences for health.Feeble development and muscular inertia must be
remedied by change of climate and tonics--iron, strychnia, and
cod-liver oil.When other methods fail to give early relief, a
purgative may be needed.Rhubarb, magnesia, calomel, Friedrichshall or
Hunyadi water, given in milk, the compound liquorice powder, the
compound anise {657} powder, are better than the more active
cathartics.[53] Habitual administration of laxatives to children ought
to be regarded as a confession that the case is incurable; it is a last
resort, for which necessity is the only argument.[Footnote 53: The compound anise powder, a non-officinal preparation in
use in Washington, is a convenient form of administration: heavy
calcined magnesia, 360 grs.; rhubarb powdered, 180 grs.; oil of anise,
40 minims; stronger alcohol, one fluidrachm.The bicarbonate or fluid
magnesia is also a good preparation.Ringer knows nothing so effectual
in bringing back the proper consistence and yellow color to the motions
of children as podophyllin.Dissolve one grain of the resin in one
drachm of alcohol, and of this give one or two drops on a lump of sugar
twice or three times a day (_op.Bouchut suggests the
same solution, with simple syrup as a menstruum.]In old persons tonics should be combined with the laxatives, as
strychnia, iron, quinia, gentian with aloes, colocynth, rhubarb, or
podophyllin.The rectum should always be examined, as impacted fecal
masses will often be found there.{658}

ENTERALGIA (INTESTINAL COLIC).BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Enterodynia, Tormina, Colicodynia, Colalgia, Dolor colicus,
Passio colica, Spasmus intestinorum, Ileus spasmodicus, Spasmus
ventriculi, Neuralgia mesenterica; Spasm of the bowels, Cholick or
Cholick Colic, and Pain in the Belly; _Ger._, Das Banchgrimmem, Die
Kolik; _Fr._, La colique.HISTORY.--Colic is described by Hippocrates.[1] He recommended the use
of emetics and gave other sound advice regarding the treatment of the
affection.Galen[2] administered sedatives, as opium and henbane, and
he advised them to be combined with carminatives.Aretaeus[3] speaks of
the pain of colic extending to the back, limbs, and testicles, and also
states that when affecting the sides of the body it may be confounded
with pleurisy, hepatitis, or splenitis.Alexander[4] points out the
differential diagnosis of the disease and directs a proper course of
treatment.Cupping, friction of the extremities, and dry fomentations
were recommended by Celsus;[5] and internally he advocated a mixture of
poppy, anise, pepper, etc.Aetius[6] describes the affection.Serapion[7] and Avicenna[8] treated of colic more clearly than any
previous writers had done, and advised narcotics administered by the
mouth and rectum.Atony of the bowels is given as a cause of the
disease by Haly Abbas,[9] and Alsaharavius adds[10] to the etiology a
hot intemperament, indurated feces, and poisonous medicines.Rhazes[11]
directs the administration of emetics when the colic is due to
indigestion.[Footnote 1: _De Affect._, xv.][Footnote 5: _Medicina_, Libri octo, iv.[Footnote 9: _Pract._, vii.[Footnote 10: _Ibid._, xvii.NATURE AND DEFINITION.--Enteralgia is the name given to intestinal pain
which is independent of indigestion and of inflammation or other
organic change in the wall of the bowel, and corresponds to gastralgia
and other visceral neuralgias.It involves the nerves which pass to the
intestine along the line of attachment of the mesentery, and which are
derived from the superior mesenteric plexus, with a prolongation from
the junction of the right pneumogastric nerve with the coeliac
plexus.[12]

[Footnote 12: The very extensive distribution of terminal
nerve-filaments in the intestine is an explanation of the frequency and
severity of attacks of intestinal pain."We may form some estimate of
the extent to which the nervous system of the intestines is developed
from the fact that about one hundred ganglia belonging to the submucous
and over two thousand to the myenteric plexus are to be found in one
square inch of the intestine of the rabbit" (Frey, _Histology_, New
York, 1875, p.{659} The pain of enteralgia is not spasmodic, and is not accompanied
by flatulence, borborygmi, or other signs of indigestion and gaseous
distension of the bowels.Colic, on the other hand, applies to intestinal pain accompanied by
indigestion, distension of the bowel with gas, or the contact of
irritating ingesta.The pain is spasmodic, and is relieved by the
passage of gas and other contents from the bowel.The pain is due to
the local irritation of the richly-gangliated plexus of nerves seated
in the submucous layer and which extends from the pylorus to the anus.At present enteralgia must be considered from its symptoms and from
post-mortem examinations as a pure neurosis of the sympathetic system.Opportunities are rarely offered for studying the post-mortem
appearances of the disease, from the fact that when idiopathic it
seldom ends fatally.Out of forty-nine autopsies on patients who had
suffered from colic due to lead-poisoning, only one was found with any
change of the abdominal ganglia of the sympathetic.Segoud found the
ganglia and some of the fibres of the sympathetic hypertrophied and
indurated,[13] and "in recent times Kussmaul and Maier have published
an example of sclerosis of the coeliac and superior cervical
ganglia."[14]

[Footnote 13: Segoud, _Essai sur la Nevralgie du Grand Sympathique_,
Paris, 1837.][Footnote 14: M. Rosenthal, "Diseases of the Nervous System," _Wood's
Library_, New York, 1879, vol.The pathology of enteralgia due to a vitiated state of the system, a
morbid condition of the tissues of the intestines, the presence of
irritating ingesta, or to reflexion from other organs, differs in no
wise from a neuralgia of other parts arising from constitutional,
local, or reflex causes.Pain will likewise manifest itself here in
consequence of deleterious substances circulating in the blood, as in
Bright's disease, rheumatism, gout, or lead-poisoning.The terminal
nerve-fibres of the intestines are irritated in attacks of colic by
substances or food within the alimentary canal; gases are generated
from the decomposition of the ingesta.The consequent dilatation of the
gut produces loss of tone and abolition of the contractile power of the
muscular coat.Constipation and pain from pressure exercised on the
neighboring nerves will be the result.Obstinate constipation, and even symptoms resembling ileus, may arise
from a portion of the intestine thus distended becoming bent upon
itself, the sharp angular flexure interrupting or completely
obstructing the passage of the feces.[15]

[Footnote 15: F. H. Hamilton, _Med.Gaz._, New York, 1880, vii.ETIOLOGY.--Enteralgia may be either idiopathic or symptomatic.The
causes can best be considered by dividing them into general and reflex.Under the head of general causes may be mentioned an inherited neurotic
temperament, particularly in individuals of a hypochondriacal tendency.Females are far more apt to suffer from this affection than males, on
account of their more impressionable nature and greater liability to
nervous diseases in general.Hereditary tendencies, overtaxing the
mental powers during the developmental period of youth, and later in
life excessive mental labor and anxiety of business affairs, are
causes.It may occur in the cachexia developed during the course of
many chronic diseases, as diarrhoea, rheumatism, gout, phthisis,
cancer, Bright's disease, etc.Various morbid conditions of the blood
are followed by {660} enteralgia, as anaemia arising from prolonged
lactation, masturbation, or venereal excesses, and the presence of
various blood-poisons, as syphilis, malaria, lead, copper, and arsenic.Other causes are living in cold, damp climates, with sudden changes of
temperature and chilling of the body.Persons addicted to the use of
tobacco or alcohol and to dissipations of various kinds may become
predisposed to enteralgia.Enteralgia is often secondary to ovarian, uterine, or other distant
disease.Also, owing to intimate sympathetic relations, pain is often
felt in the bowels as a result of disease situated in some of the solid
abdominal viscera, as the liver, spleen, and pancreas.In the same way,
organic affections of the brain and spinal cord, especially acute
myelitis and spinal sclerosis and lesions of the vertebral bones,
excite intestinal pain.The
application of cold to the feet or catching cold in general is followed
by pain which is due to reflex influence.There may be a predisposition to colic from hereditary influence and
the neurotic temperament.A feeble digestion is a source of constant
risk.Much of the pain occurring in the course of dysentery, catarrh of
the bowel, invagination, fecal impaction, and other structural
affections is of the nature of colic.The most frequent by far of the
local causes is the direct irritation of the terminal nerve-fibrils by
substances within the alimentary canal and by over-distension of the
bowel with contained gas.Some of these irritants are partly-digested
and indigestible articles of food; food taken cold or in excessive
quantity; the decomposition of food and consequent distension of the
bowel by gas.Acid drinks and alcohol have the same effect.Constipation with scybalae may produce colic in an otherwise healthy
person.A morbid state of the intestinal secretions, either as regards
quantity or quality, is said to have a like result, but this is a
doubtful cause.Foreign bodies within the canal, as fruit-stones,
various concretions, worms, and gall-stones if of large size, may
produce pain during their passage through the bowel.Cathartic
medicines may be enumerated as among the local causes, and also various
poisonous drugs.Lesions of any sort seated in the intestinal wall, as
ulcers and neoplasms, induce paroxysmal pains.SYMPTOMS.--The pain of enteralgia occurs in attacks which come on
slowly and continue for a variable time--some hours or days.The pain
is situated about the umbilicus, and is relieved by deep pressure,
although at the same time there may be hyperaesthesia of the skin.The
intensity of suffering ranges from a dull heavy pain to one which is
acute and lancinating.Retraction of the abdomen is common, but there
may be tympanites.No signs of indigestion may appear, but eructations
of tasteless gas, or even borborygmi, may be complained of.The duration of an attack of enteralgia is variable and depends to a
great extent upon the cause.Usually, when the symptoms are severe, the
duration is short.It may pass off in less than an hour, or a
succession of paroxysms continue to recur, and the attack will be kept
up for several days, weeks, or even a month.One seizure predisposes to
another, and each is liable to be more severe than its predecessor.The malady may end gradually or as rapidly as it was ushered in.Attacks are often mitigated, or even terminated, by the occurrence of
some other morbid condition--by a profuse sweat, the discharge of
lochia, {661} the menses, or some secretion which has been checked.The
development of rheumatism or gout may relieve it.Attacks often
terminate with vomiting, belching, and more especially with movements
of the bowels and discharge of flatus.A free emission of pale,
colorless urine is sometimes followed by relief.This occurs in
hysterical cases, and the disease is generally accompanied with some
uterine disorder and with tenderness along the spine.The attack of intestinal colic may be developed suddenly and with full
intensity, or it may be preceded a short time, usually a few hours, and
rarely much longer, by prodromic symptoms.These are nausea, a
sensation of weight in the epigastrium, anorexia, eructations,
tympanites, rumbling, and slight griping pains.The patient is
irritable and restless, his bowels are usually confined, and urination
is often rendered painful by the distended bowels pressing upon the
bladder.These symptoms, which are in truth but a part of the attack, being only
of a lower grade, increase in severity and the pain becomes more acute
and distinctly paroxysmal.It is of a sharp cutting, twisting, or most
frequently griping character, and is in the earlier part of the attack
usually referred to the umbilicus or to one of the iliac fossae, and
sometimes radiating thence in different directions.Generally it
becomes concentrated about the umbilicus.The exacerbations of pain
vary in degree of severity, in duration, and in frequency of
recurrence, while the intervals may afford complete relief or merely a
remission of the acute suffering.The sufferer either lies quietly upon
his abdomen or upon one side or the other, with his body bent forward
and thighs flexed, or he is restless and writhes in pain, groaning and
crying out from the intensity of suffering.He may seek relief by
trying a variety of positions and by pressure applied with the hands or
some solid object against the abdomen.Anxiety and pain are depicted in
his features.His face and extremities are cool and covered with a
clammy sweat.The pulse is small, hard, and generally slower than
normal.Breathing is sometimes oppressed, as a result of spasmodic
contraction of the abdominal and thoracic muscles.Often the muscles of
the hands, calves of the legs, and the feet are similarly affected.The
tongue is moist and as a rule clean.The bowels are constipated--at
times so much so as to amount to obstruction--or, again, diarrhoea and
tenesmus may be present.Other abdominal symptoms are nausea or vomiting, eructation of gas, and
borborygmi.Micturition is at times urgent and painful, and the
testicles are frequently retracted.The abdomen is occasionally tender, but pressure generally affords
relief.It is distended with gas, especially over the large bowel.Palpation often reveals lumps or knots situated within the abdominal
walls and due to spasmodic contraction of its muscles, particularly of
the recti.In thin persons the constricted and dilated coils of the
intestines can also be distinguished as nodular masses which rapidly
alter in shape and position.The severity of attacks of colic varies from a few slight griping pains
felt at intervals to a seizure of such intensity that the patient
suffers agony and presents symptoms of an alarming nature.Fortunately,
these grave cases are comparatively seldom observed.In them the local
and general symptoms are aggravated.Pain is more intense and {662}
constant, having less marked intervals of relief, and the patient may
pass into collapse, with a small, rapid, and wavering pulse, restricted
respiration, shivering and chilliness, and a cool, clammy skin.The
abdomen is greatly distended; hiccough comes on, also stercoraceous
vomiting, tenesmus, and in the worst cases involuntary stools and
suppression of urine.Nervous symptoms have been observed, as dizziness
or fainting, and finally delirium and convulsions may end the scene.VARIETIES.--Attention has been called to a distinct form of enteralgia
due to the effects of alcohol.[16] It affects steady drinkers, and is,
as a rule, met with only during the hot months.The presence of
undigested food within the alimentary canal or exposure to cold may act
as exciting causes of the disease.Dull pains, felt at first over the abdomen, become later more
continuous and fixed about the epigastrium or umbilicus.Sometimes they
are complained of more over the bladder.Bilious vomiting and hiccough
are prominent symptoms; the patient is thirsty, and the liquids taken
only promote vomiting; and the bowels are constipated.There is
restlessness, and sleep is obtained with difficulty.Paralysis at times
supervenes, and affects the lower as well as upper extremities.In the
worst cases delirium and even convulsions occur.The disease nearly
always ends in recovery in from three to ten days.Severe intestinal
and gastric pain occurs in opium-eaters, but especially in women who
use morphia in excess.The suffering is always greater when the opiate
is reduced, but can only be cured by breaking up the bad habit.[Footnote 16: Colica bacchanalium, J. H. Claiborne, _Med.Monthly_, New
York, 1855, p.A variety of colic which occurs epidemically[17] in some of the
inter-tropical countries has been studied and described by different
observers.It is known by various names, such as colique seche; colique
vegetale; rachialgie vegetal; colic of Poitou, of Devonshire, of
Madrid, of Java, of Surinam; colique nerveuse; endemique des Pays
Chauds (Fonssagrives); endemic colic, dry colic, bilious colic, nervous
colic; girafy; dandy, etc.Segoud called it a neurosis of the great
sympathetic, and attributed the disease to the effect of cold.[18] The
symptoms resemble, in many respects, those of lead colic, and at one
time they were erroneously considered identical with it.[19] Thompson
and Chisholm,[20] after an {663} experience with the disease in the
West Indies, assert that such is not the case.Epidemics which occurred
in Madrid and several of the Spanish provinces, and many hundred cases
witnessed among the French soldiers by other observers, were
ascertained not to be due to lead-poisoning.[Footnote 17: Colique vegetale, or endemic and epidemic colic, did not
escape the notice of the older writers.It is mentioned by Aretaeus;
Paulus AEgineta describes an epidemic of the disease which extended
through Italy and a large part of the Roman empire, and he states that
attacks were often followed by paralysis.Francois Citois gives an
account of an epidemic which raged at Poitou in 1616.Monson Smith
described the disease in 1717.In 1724 it appeared in Devonshire,
England, and presented the characteristic symptoms and sequelae.In
more recent times epidemics of the disease have occurred in nearly all
the countries of Europe.It prevailed in the northern part of France
and in Belgium from 1853 to 1859, inclusive.It has likewise visited
the Caribbee Isles, Cayenne, Guadaloupe, Madagascar, India, the West
Indies, some of the provinces of Spain, Java, the west coast of Africa,
the Antilles, Senegal, New Zealand, Brazil, and various other
localities.The disease occurs in all seasons, but is more prevalent in
summer and in the commencement of autumn.][Footnote 18: Segoud, _Essai sur la Nevralgie du Grand Sympathique_,
Paris, 1837.][Footnote 19: The disease frequently appeared on board of French
war-vessels, and was regarded by Lefevre (_Recherches sur les Causes de
la Colique seche_) as due to lead-poisoning.He asserts that lead is
more used in French ships than in those of other nations, and accounts
for its being epidemic in tropical countries because a warm climate
aids in developing the affection, and because there men drink more
freely of water.(See also Dutrouleau, _Arch.gen._, 1855, "Mal des
Europeens dans les Pays Chauds.")][Footnote 20: Quoted by Oppolzer, _Wien.The affection is not accompanied with any constant lesion.Pascal[21]
made post-mortem examinations in six cases and found the mucous
membrane of the duodenum a little reddened: the gall-bladder contained
thick bile, and in a few cases there was congestion of the sympathetic
ganglia.The attack is usually marked by certain prodromic symptoms.The patient complains of malaise, loss of appetite, a load in the
epigastrium, embarras gastrique, dull pains in the colon, borborygmi,
and cramps or tingling in the limbs.For the first few days the bowels
generally move several times daily.The stools are difficult, painful,
and of a black or dark-green color, offensive odor, and accompanied
with the discharge of flatus.As the disease progresses the bowels
become constipated and the discharge of gas ceases.After a few days
the pain is more severe and radiates to the lumbar region, the
testicles, or the thighs.It is seated principally in the epigastrium,
in the line of the transverse colon, or it may involve the whole
abdomen.Movement aggravates the pain, while pressure often relieves
it.The tongue is large, trembling, and coated white or yellow; the
breath is fetid, the saliva viscid, and mouth sticky.Anorexia is
complete; there are hiccough, nausea, vomiting of undigested food and
mucous or bilious matters, and constipation with hard black stools.The abdomen may be distended or
retracted, and micturition is often painful and the urine high-.The pulse is generally slower than in health, but becomes accelerated
when the attack is over.The skin is pale, the conjunctiva often
stained with bile, and in the later stages oedema of the lids and
emaciation come on.The effect upon the nervous system may manifest
itself by amaurosis, deafness, delirium, mania, coma, epileptiform
convulsions, or paralysis.The paralysis affects the extensors of the
hand, arm, and leg, or it may become general and end in death.[Footnote 21: "Recherches anatomico-pathologique sur la Colique dite de
Madrid," _Rec.mil._, Paris, 1826, xix.The duration of the disease is from eight to fifteen days, but in some
cases it becomes chronic.At times
intermittent or remittent symptoms develop, and occasionally the
affection is complicated with enteritis or peritonitis.The prognosis
depends very much upon the character of the epidemic, and the most
serious cases are those accompanied with either cerebral symptoms or
peritonitis.The paralysis sometimes passes off in a few days, but oftener lasts
indefinitely.Emetics, purgatives, and anodynes are recommended in the
treatment of the disease, and frequently a change of climate is
necessary in order to recover fully from the affection.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of enteralgia usually presents some
difficulty even when the symptoms are well marked.That the disease is
a true neuralgia is apparent from the periodical recurrence of the
pain, its sharp and darting character, from the sudden cessation
followed by complete relief, and from the absence of symptoms of
indigestion.Affections bearing a certain resemblance to enteralgia are
to be excluded.In lumbo-abdominal neuralgia the pain is unilateral and extends around
{664} to the back.Tender spots can usually be detected by pressure on
the umbilical or hypogastric regions or on the spinous processes of the
vertebrae.In dermalgia the soreness is superficial, and light pressure
gives more pain than deep compression, while nervous and hysterical
symptoms are constantly associated with this form.Gastralgia is more
frequent than enteralgia, and the pain is located about the ensiform
cartilage.In myalgia of the abdominal parietes pressure causes pain,
as do also movements of the body, coughing, sneezing, etc.Rheumatic
pains would likely be felt in other muscles.In ileus the pain is more
continuous, the tenderness localized; there is constipation of a most
obstinate character, and vomiting of stercoraceous matter.The patient
has an anxious expression and a rapid, feeble pulse.In renal calculus
the pain is situated in the course of the ureter and shoots down to the
pubes and thighs.There is frequent desire to urinate, accompanied by a
scanty discharge of urine, and a copious flow of urine is followed by
cessation of pain.The maximum of pain in hepatic colic is situated in
the right hypochondrium, and is often reflected into the shoulder of
the same side.Colic arising from
lead-poisoning is usually associated with sufficiently characteristic
symptoms to render the diagnosis easy.When syphilitic the pain is apt
to be most severe at night.In catarrh of the bowel the skin is hot and dry, the pulse accelerated,
and other indications of a symptomatic fever are presented.The pain is
more constant, more localized, and pressure causes it to be increased.Tenderness on pressure is not invariably met with, but the rule holds
good that when deep pressure increases the pain inflammation rather
than enteralgia is indicated.If colic is due to indigestible food, a sensation of weight will be
complained of at the epigastrium, griping pains occur at short
intervals, with flatulence, vomiting, and later diarrhoea.If the
attack be wind colic, the abdomen is enlarged by tympanitic distension;
borborygmi and belching occur.If it is the result of accumulation of
feces, there would be a previous history of constipation, and the lump
of feculent matter can be located by palpation and percussion.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of idiopathic enteralgia is favorable, the
disease generally terminating after a variable period.Attacks are very
apt to recur, and each one will, in all probability, prove more severe
than the preceding.In symptomatic enteralgia the prognosis will depend
upon the nature of the fundamental disease.Colic terminates favorably in nearly every case.Death has rarely
occurred from complications, as convulsions, and rupture of the bowel
has been observed from great distension.TREATMENT.--If attacks of enteralgia are associated with hysterical
symptoms, it would be proper to employ antispasmodic sedatives.The
compound spirit of ether is very useful in these cases, especially if
they are accompanied with flatulence.Rubbing the spine with
stimulating or anodyne liniments frequently promises well.The
hypodermic dose of morphia gives relief more quickly than can be got in
any other way, but in pure enteralgia with frequently recurring
paroxysms care must be taken not to create the demand for the remedy by
giving it often.The radical cure of the disease is a more important
matter than the treatment of the acute attacks.{665} If the cause of enteralgia be located in some of the solid
viscera or in the nervous system, remedies should be addressed to these
parts, and the reflex nervous impressions allayed by the bromides or
other nervous sedatives.The valerianate of zinc in doses of one grain
three or four times a day is extremely useful in neuralgia from reflex
irritation of the female pelvic organs.Constitutional remedies are
indicated in the cases due to a morbid condition of the blood--iodide
of potassium and mercury if a syphilitic poison or if of a rheumatic or
plumbic origin; colchicum if gouty; quinia if malarial; and iron when
an anaemic state is presented.H. C. Wood states that alum is used with
success; being of service when there is no lead in the primae viae, it
must act in some other way than as a chemical antidote.Arsenic is very
highly recommended in idiopathic enteralgia.Excellent results have
been reported from the use of nitrate of silver,[22] hydrocyanic acid,
belladonna,[23] and iodoform.Change of climate and travel may have to
be resorted to in obstinate cases.[Footnote 22: Nauman, _Deutsche Klinik_, Bd.[Footnote 23: _Lancet_, vol.The objects of treatment in colic are to relieve suffering and
terminate the attack as soon as possible.For this purpose the various
anodyne and antispasmodic remedies, as opium, hyoscyamus, chloral,
ether, chloroform, Indian hemp, and camphor, may be employed.Carminatives are most useful, alone or combined with anodynes and
cathartics.Oleum cajuputi often affords immediate relief.Warm teas of
chamomile, ginger, valerian, or peppermint sometimes do good.When the
suffering is very acute nothing acts so promptly as a hypodermic
injection of morphia, either alone or combined with atropia.The surface of the body should be kept warm, and hot applications to
the abdomen assist in relieving pain.The heat may be conveniently
applied by means of poultices, hot salt- or sand-bags, or rubber
bottles filled with hot water.Cold,[24] used externally, is more
grateful in some cases, and is preferable if there be much tympanites.Sinapisms, turpentine stupes, and stimulating and rubefacient liniments
answer well in some cases, and should be tried.Anodyne applications to
the spine occasionally do good, and cold, applied by means of the
spinal ice-bag, is recommended by Ringer.[Footnote 24: Roux, _Journal de Medecine_, Paris, 1765, p.In order to treat the disease successfully and bring the attack to an
end, its cause should be ascertained if possible, and remedies directed
to its removal.If it be the result of indigestion, the contents of the
stomach should be removed by emetics.Drastic or powerful cathartics
will only tend to aggravate the disease, and on that account mild
laxatives are to be preferred in all cases.Castor oil, calomel, pil.In flatulent colic means should be directed to expel the gas.Anodynes--preferably chloroform--and carminatives should be
administered by the mouth, and enemata containing turpentine or
asafoetida injected into the rectum.In severe cases a clyster with ten
or fifteen drops of liquor ammoniae is said to do good.If distension
of the bowel be so great as to threaten rupture, it may with propriety
and safety be relieved by puncturing the colon with an exploring-needle
or a fine trocar.In cases of flatulent colic where the gas arises from
the decomposition of food {666} remedies to check fermentation, such as
alkalies, creasote, carbolic acid, or the sulphites, would be
indicated.Good sometimes results from pressure and massage of the
abdomen.Rubbing with etherized oils and electricity have also been
used successfully.If the attack be from fecal impaction, it may be
possible to liquefy and remove the mass by using saline cathartics, as
sulphate of magnesium, aided by large oily or mucilaginous clysters,
which in obstinate cases should be injected through a flexible rubber
tube passed up the rectum as far as possible.Injections of an infusion
of tobacco are now seldom used for this purpose, on account of the
dangerous symptoms which often supervene.If pain or tenderness be
present at the seat of impaction, cathartics should be used very
cautiously or not at all, and opium given instead.The administration
of this drug, by relieving pain and allaying spasmodic action, is often
followed by free catharsis.Persons subject to attacks of colic may diminish the intensity, or even
prevent the recurrence, of the disease by employing during the
intervals such remedies as would be indicated in their individual
cases.Phosphate of sodium has been highly recommended for preventing
the recurrence of attacks of colic.R. N. Taylor states[25] that his
experience with the use of the drug is quite extensive, and he found
the treatment uniformly successful.Thirty grains dissolved in a
glassful of water may be taken three times a day--preferably before
meals--and this quantity should be reduced if it causes any irritation
of the stomach.The bowels should be regulated and strict attention
given to diet.A milk diet is of course best in obstinate cases.Any
article of food known to disagree must be excluded, and tea, coffee,
and alcoholic drinks should also be prohibited.Herald_, Louisville, 1880-81, ii.{667}

ACUTE INTESTINAL CATARRH (DUODENITIS, JEJUNITIS, ILEITIS, COLITIS,
PROCTITIS).BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Enteritis, Catarrhal enteritis, Mucous enteritis,
Endo-enteritis, Ileo-colitis, Entero-colitis, Diarrhoea.Older
synonyms: Chordapsus, Cauma enteritis, Enterophlogia, Enterophlogosis,
Colica acuta seu inflammatoria, Ileus inflammatorius, Enteralgia
inflammatoria, Febris intestinorum seu Iliaca inflammatoria, Colique
inflammatoire.HISTORY.--It is interesting to start at the fountain-head of the two
streams of inquiry--the clinical and the anatomical--and to follow each
in its widely-diverging wanderings until they unite to give to the
phenomena of intestinal inflammation a just interpretation.The symptom diarrhoea was fully described by the earliest writers in
medicine.[1] The symptomatic differences between diarrhoea, dysentery,
and lientery and the different forms of diarrhoea (bilious, watery,
etc.)were given in detail by the Greek and Roman physicians.The
Arabians had a much more elaborate classification of the fluxes.Avicenna made seven varieties of simple diarrhoea.European writers
followed closely in these footsteps.Sennert made twelve and Sauvages
twenty-one varieties of diarrhoea, depending upon as many different
causes, as undigested food, worms, the bile, etc.Many recent writers
have adhered closely to the older authors in their method of treating
of diarrhoea, regarding it as a disease and dividing it into varieties
based on the causes or on the appearances of the stools.Among them may
be mentioned Cullen (1789), Good (1825), Tweedie (1841), G. B. Wood
(1852), Trousseau (1865), and Habershon (1879).[Footnote 1: J. J. Woodward, _Med.of the War_, Part 2,
Medical Volume, foot-note, p.273 _et seq._]

It was only after many years of laborious investigation that the
appropriate lesion was affixed to a symptom so well understood and
described in its clinical aspects.The first conception of abdominal
and intestinal inflammation had no relation to diarrhoea.Under the
name [Greek: eileos], Hippocrates described abdominal symptoms of
intestinal obstruction and inflammation.For Sennert (1641)
inflammation of the intestines meant peritonitis.Bonet (1679), Hoffman
(1710), and Boerhaave (1758) included under this head peritonitis,
ileus, and all febrile and painful abdominal affections.Sauvages
(1763) and Morgagni (1779) gave in detail the symptoms of peritonitis
and called the disease intestinal inflammation--enteritis.In 1784,
Cullen made an advance in subdividing {668} enteritis into e.
phlegmonodoea and e. erythematica--the one involving the entire wall of
the intestine and the peritoneum, the other the mucous membrane lining
the intestine.John Hunter (1794) first fixed the place of peritonitis
as a distinct affection from inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
intestines.[2]

[Footnote 2: J. Hunter, _A Treatise on the Blood, Inflammation, and
Gun-shot Wounds_, London, 1794, p.Up to this time constipation was the chief symptom of enteritis.The
meeting of the streams, the affixing the symptom diarrhoea to its
appropriate lesion, was brought about hypothetically at first by J.
Carmichael Smith in these words: "I think it is probable (for we can
have no positive evidence of the fact) that in diarrhoeas from catching
cold the villous or interior coat of the stomach is sometimes slightly
inflamed."[3]

[Footnote 3: Paper read Jan.On the Continent enteritis soon after this was limited in its meaning
by Pinel (1798) to inflammation of the mucous membrane of any part of
the intestines.He gave the name catarrhal diarrhoea to the same
condition.A still further restriction of its meaning was made by
Broussais (1821), who defined enteritis to be an inflammation of the
mucous membrane of the small intestine; he gave the name colitis to the
same disease in the colon.This distinction was adopted by Rostan
(1826), Andral (1836), C. H. Fuchs (1846), G. B. Wood (1852),
Wunderlich (1856), Grisolle (1865), Flint (1866), and Aitkin (1868).According to the views of some authors, chiefly English, as Copland
(1844), Bristowe (1871), Roberts (1874), Habershon (1879), enteritis
includes inflammation of the serous as well as of the mucous coat of
the intestines.Niemeyer (1864), Jaccoud (1869), Leube (1875), Bartholow (1880), and
most German and French authors prefer the name intestinal catarrh as
applied to inflammation of the mucous coat; inflammation of the serous
coat is peritonitis; the word enteritis is abandoned as involving a
pathological error.NATURE AND CLASSIFICATION.--Catarrh of the intestines is an
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the intestinal tract.There are
various peculiarities of the catarrhal process due to the anatomical
structure of the parts involved, the presence of open glands, lymphatic
follicles, etc.This disease is to be distinguished from inflammation
of the serous coat of the intestine (peritonitis).The two are quite
distinct in their etiology, pathological anatomy, and symptomatology,
although they have been often confounded under the same name,
enteritis.[4] As so much confusion prevails as to the proper meaning of
enteritis, it is best to abandon the word altogether.[Footnote 4: For cases called enteritis in which the lesions of
peritonitis were found, see Hamilton, _Edin.Examiner_, Oct., 1869, p.Diarrhoea is still regarded by some authors (J. J. Woodward) as
synonymous with intestinal catarrh; by others it is considered
separately as a disease distinct from catarrh.Habershon describes the
lesions of catarrhal diarrhoea and mucous enteritis almost in the same
words.[5] It is an unscientific method to take one symptom of a
pathological state, to {669} erect it into a disease, subdividing it
into varieties which are but differences in the intensity of its
manifestation, and to assign to it no fixed lesion.Diarrhoea is in
reality but a sequence and symptom of hyperaemia or inflammation of the
intestinal mucous membrane.[Footnote 5: Such a method of treating the subject involves a
repetition, with an inversion, of the same description.Thus, catarrhal
diarrhoea has as its lesion mucous enteritis; mucous enteritis has for
its symptom (catarrhal) diarrhoea.]ETIOLOGY.--Intestinal inflammation is more prevalent in the Northern,
Middle, and Western than in the Southern States.There is no relation
between the distribution of malarial and intestinal diseases: in some
regions where malarial disease is rife there is very little disease of
the intestines.Limited areas in Lower Mississippi, Eastern Kentucky,
Eastern North Carolina, etc.have a special predisposition to diseases
of this class.[6]

[Footnote 6: F. A. Walker, _Statistical Atlas_, 1874, table v. p.During the Civil War diarrhoea and dysentery were more frequent and
fatal in the central region than in the Atlantic and Pacific regions.It is difficult to compare the relative liabilibity of the native and
foreign-born populations in the United States to intestinal disease.Inasmuch as children, among whom the bulk of such cases occur, bear
such a small proportion to the adult foreign population, allowing for
differences due to this cause, statistics show that the foreign-born
race has a very distinct predisposition to these forms of disease.[7]
The Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes have a marked susceptibility to
intestinal diseases; the English and Welsh have the same tendency; but
the Irish have a comparative immunity.The <DW52> race is more prone
to intestinal than to malarial diseases in the Middle States, but there
is the reverse susceptibility in the Northern and Southern States.[Footnote 7: The number of children under ten to 1000 native population
is 306; number of children under ten in 1000 foreign population, 47 (F.
A. Walker, "Relations of Race and Nationality to Mortality in the
United States," _Statistical Atlas_, 1874, p.Under ten years more males than females have enteritis, in the
proportion represented by the figures 362 and 299.After ten the
predisposition of the two sexes is about the same.The summer is the season when diarrhoea is most prevalent and most
fatal.June, July, and August are the months in which the greatest
number of cases occur and in which there is the highest mortality.The
extraordinary death-rate in these months in cities is of course due to
the influence of summer heat on children, and the death-rate from
diarrhoea and entero-colitis is chiefly among infants under one year.The highest monthly mortality
from acute diarrhoea among the U.S.troops (white) between 1861 and
1866 was 147, in July, 1862; the next highest was 114, in August, 1862.June and September were after these the most fatal months.According to
the census of 1870, the most fatal month is August.Elevation of temperature in the summer months is the cause of the
prevalence of intestinal catarrh and of its great mortality among
infants and children.The number of deaths bears a direct ratio to the
degree of heat, the highest death-rate occurring in seasons of unusual
high temperature.[8] The effect of excessive or prolonged heat is to
arrest or weaken the digestive processes; undigested masses in the
stomach or the intestines act as foreign bodies and produce
inflammation.[Footnote 8: Among the numerous publications bearing on this subject,
those contained in _The Sanitary Care and Treatment of Children and
their Diseases_ (Boston, 1881) are of especial value.S. C. Busey's
article contains much valuable matter on the relation of summer heat to
illness and mortality among children.]{670} Sudden changes of temperature from cold to heat or from heat to
cold develop diarrhoea.If the air is at the same time saturated with
moisture, the effect of a change in temperature is greatly intensified.In the first hot days of June there is on the Atlantic coast,
especially in cities, a rapid increase in the number of cases of
gastro-intestinal disturbance.A larger number of children are taken
ill in June than in August.The child in time becomes habituated to
heat, and if not attacked early runs less risk of illness in the later
months.A sudden or unusual exposure to low temperature, as in lying on
damp ground, leads to the same result.The check to perspiration after
violent exercise is especially provocative of diarrhoea.In these
instances the congestion and consequent inflammation of the mucous
membrane are brought about through the effect of heat or cold upon the
peripheral nervous system.Cold may act more directly by the driving of
suddenly-cooled blood from the surface of the body to the interior.External burns belong to the same category, as they lead to extensive
inflammation, sometimes to ulceration, of the duodenal mucous membrane
through reflex influence.A case is reported of a boy aged twelve years
who after an external superficial burn of the left thigh was taken with
profuse diarrhoea which ended fatally in three hours (Ziemssen).Contamination of the atmosphere with emanations the result of the
overcrowding of many human beings together, as in prisons, camps, or
asylums, especially where decomposition of organic matter is going on,
is of great influence in causing diarrhoea.Persons living in
badly-ventilated houses, or in houses improperly drained where the air
is vitiated by escaping gas from sewer-pipes, are especially prone to
be attacked.But sewer-gas, per se, does not cause diarrhoea any more
than it causes diphtheria or scarlatina.[9] It is a step backward to
hang upon this ready explanation all our doubts and our ignorance of
the origin of disease.The specific germ of the zymotic diseases may be
conveyed in the gases from sewers, but there are other and more direct
modes of communication which should receive equal attention.Journ._, London, 1880, vol.519) believes that summer diarrhoea has a specific poison which is
intimately connected with the process of putrefaction, and that the
infective material has its source in the public sewers.]Children are much more liable to intestinal inflammation than adults.This is due to the greater susceptibility of the mucous membrane in
them to congestion and catarrh from external influences and from direct
irritation.In infants fed upon an unsuitable diet--cow's milk or other
substitutes for mother's milk--this susceptibility is much increased.The age most liable to attack is under one year, or from the first to
the second year, when, in consequence of dentition, weaning, and a
change from a diet chiefly or almost wholly liquid to one of solids,
there is a great liability to a disturbance of the normal equilibrium.Intestinal catarrh forms almost one-third of the total number of the
affections of childhood.According to the census of 1870, 761 out of
every 1000 deaths from diarrhoea, dysentery, and enteritis occurred
under the tenth year.In old age a similar predisposition exists, and a
mild attack will in old persons induce more serious symptoms than in
middle life.Epidemics of diarrhoea among the aged in asylums and
hospitals are not uncommon.{671} Temperament and idiosyncrasy are causes of differences in
predisposition.Many persons in consequence of taking cold invariably
have diarrhoea, while others as invariably have nasal catarrh or
bronchitis.Certain articles of food, as oysters and eggs, lead always
in some persons to intestinal disturbance.An exaggerated sensibility
of the mucous membrane to particular impressions is the cause of this
peculiarity.Previous attacks of intestinal inflammation render the individual
liable to recurrences from very slight causes.The suppression of the
menses and of hemorrhoidal discharges and the healing of eruptions are
said to be followed by serious diarrhoea, but such an occurrence is
probably more often a coincidence than a result.Sedentary life, by enfeebling muscular movement and by inducing
indigestion and constipation, brings on diarrhoea.Constipation impairs
the muscular tone of the bowel, and hardened fecal accumulations act as
irritants which sometimes provoke acute catarrhal processes--diarrhoea
and dysentery.Insufficient clothing in children and in adults makes
the skin more susceptible to changes of temperature and conduces to
intestinal congestion.Smoking in excess and the use of narcotics and
stimulants are mentioned as debilitating causes which pave the way for
disease in the intestine; the habitual use of the stronger liquors, by
keeping up chronic engorgement of the mucous membrane, is undoubtedly a
potent cause.Occupations which involve deprivation of fresh air and
sunlight, and all trades which enfeeble the individual, make him liable
to all digestive disorders.A feeble constitution, debility from
disease, from over-fatigue, or from loss of sleep, or any perturbing
influence, puts the body in a state favorable to indigestion and
diarrhoea.The eruptive fevers are accompanied more or less by gastro-enteric
catarrh.In scarlet fever, measles, and variola there is a state of
equilibrium between the skin and the intestinal mucous membrane.When
the morbid manifestation does not normally appear upon the skin there
is a transference of irritation to the intestine.The administration of
purgatives in the early periods of scarlet fever and measles delays,
sometimes prevents, the outburst of the eruption on the skin.The
intestinal catarrh of the eruptive fevers has sometimes the
significance of an exanthem and sometimes of a secondary complication.In measles it is more frequently the former; in scarlatina and variola
it comes later as a complication.Uraemia, malarial infection, chronic suppuration, pyaemia and
septicaemia, cancerous and strumous disease of the mesenteric glands,
scurvy, tuberculosis, Bright's disease, and chronic wasting diseases in
general, are conditions in which diarrhoea appears as a result of the
defective nutrition of the vessels of the intestinal wall and their
liability to dilatation and hyperaemia, or from the presence in the
blood of septic matter.[10]

[Footnote 10: For experiments relating to the production of intestinal
catarrh by injections of irritating or putrid matter into the blood
consult _Traite clinique et experimentelle des Fievres dites
essentielles_, Gaspard et Bouillaud; also, _Path.anat._, Lebert, tome
ii., Texte, Paris, 1861, p.The ingestion of a larger quantity of food than the stomach and
intestines are able to soften, and the taking of food essentially
indigestible or improperly prepared by cooking, are causes of the
passage of masses of food more or less unaltered along the intestinal
tract.Hyperaemia {672} follows the mechanical irritation of the mucous
surface.When articles of food are in a partial state of putrefaction,
so that the antiseptic properties of the gastric juice cannot be
quickly enough brought into play, there is a rapid fermentation in the
stomach, with the development of symptoms of gastric and subsequently
of intestinal catarrh.Unripe fruit, vegetables composed of hard
tissue, as early potatoes, cucumbers, pineapples, and cherries, by
their indigestible nature, are frequent causes.Oysters, crabs, fish,
and lobsters often occasion acute diarrhoea in consequence of being in
an unfit condition for food.Cheese has been known to produce violent
illness with symptoms of intense intestinal irritation; these effects
are due to some poisonous substance, hitherto undiscovered, developed
in the course of putrefaction.New coffee causes diarrhoea; six months
is usually the time before coffee grown in Ceylon reaches the European
and American markets; by this time it does not have this effect.[11]

[Footnote 11: J. Stevenson, "Medical Notes from Ceylon," _Edin.Journ._, Feb., 1862, p.The irritant and caustic poisons, as mineral acids, caustic alkalies,
corrosive sublimate, arsenic, oxalic acid, tartar emetic, and carbolic
acid, kindle an intense inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
stomach, duodenum, and of the lower portion of the intestinal canal.Softening of the coats of the intestines from corrosion, with
perforation, is not an infrequent result.Drastic purgatives act as irritant poisons in producing acute
hyperaemia of the mucous coat with excessive transudation of serum; or,
in other words, an acute catarrh.A discharge of vitiated bile or an
excess of bile is given by recent[12] as well as by older writers as a
provoking cause of diarrhoea.The proper relationship is the reverse of
this: an intestinal catarrh the result of irritant action upon the
mucous surface entails a more active outflow of bile, just as some
cathartics by irritating the duodenum excite the gall-bladder to empty
itself.[13] Impacted fecal masses are direct irritants, exciting
inflammation (typhlitis, dysentery); putrefactive changes in
long-retained fecal collections have an additional power of irritation.Foreign bodies accidentally or purposely swallowed, intestinal
parasites, the pus from an abscess which bursts into the intestine,
likewise are excitants of disease.Tubercle nodules, typhoid ulcers,
cancer, or other neoplasms in the wall are surrounded by areas of
inflammation.ed., Philada.,
1880, p.[Footnote 13: "The propositions which are the foundation of the whole
theory that bile can cause diarrhoea, and that its absence leads to
costiveness, cannot be looked upon as proved" (J. Wickham Legg, _On the
Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, New York, 1880, p.Alcohol taken in excess, as in a debauch, leads to acute
gastro-intestinal catarrh.The stomach symptoms are the earliest to
develop and are the most prominent.Habitual alcoholic indulgence is a
more common source of chronic than of acute intestinal catarrh.The influence of unwholesome drinking-water as a cause of diarrhoea has
been carefully examined by Woodward.[14] Turbid or muddy water holding
inorganic matters in suspension, he concludes from the evidence, is not
a source of disease, and the injurious effects of such waters have been
grossly exaggerated.Water containing inorganic substances in solution
produce diarrhoea, and are purgative if the dissolved matters have
purgative properties.Limestone-water may produce {673} temporary
disturbance of the bowels, but is wholesome.Carbonate and sulphate of
lime and magnesium in solution are more cathartic, but not as much so
as selenitic waters which contain an excess of sulphate of lime.The
salts of sodium and potassium in the waters of Colorado, New Mexico,
and Utah are still more liable to produce diarrhoea.History of the War_, Part 2, Medical
Volume, p.599 _et seq._]

Water contaminated with organic matters of vegetable origin, which are
found in states of decomposition in marshes and stagnant pools, does
not, in the opinion of Woodward and Parkes, have very great influence
in the production of diarrhoea or dysentery.Impurities from
decomposition of animal matters are unhealthful.This is especially
true of water impregnated with soakage from privies and sewers; and yet
epidemics of diarrhoea cannot as often be clearly traced to this source
as can outbreaks of typhoid fever.Parkes says water contaminated with
three to ten grains per gallon of putrescent animal matter may be
hurtful.Contusions and injuries of the bowel by sudden pressure or shock to the
abdominal wall may lead to intestinal inflammation.The large intestine
is more exposed from its size and position to such injuries.Pressure
upon the bowel by a tumor, as an enlarged or retroverted uterus, may
cause diarrhoea, the source of which may be overlooked.Early-morning
diarrhoea from a displaced womb is of frequent occurrence.Emotional influence, as sudden fright or grief, will produce sudden
diarrhoea.Lesions of nerve-centres--corona radiata, optic thalamus, or
corpus callosum--induce hyperaemia, softening, and ulceration of the
mucous membrane of the small intestine.[15]

[Footnote 15: Rosenthal, "Diseases of the Nervous System," _Wood's
Library_, New York, 1879, vol.Minute organisms (bacteria) are thought by some observers to be the
cause of diarrhoea, especially of a zymotic form, which prevails in the
summer months.In accordance with this theory, the dejecta from
infected persons are the vehicle of the contagious poison which by air-
and water-contamination infects others.[16]

[Footnote 16: Wm.Johnston, _Lancet_, London, 1878, vol.Journ._, London, 1879, p.81; also, G. E. Paget, "On
the Etiology of Zymotic Diarrhoea," _Brit.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--A description of the morbid anatomy of acute
intestinal catarrh includes the changes which are observed (1) in the
exterior appearances of the intestines, (2) in their contents, and (3)
in the condition of their mucous lining.The external appearances of the intestines depend upon the degree of
distension of the tube, the character of the contents, and the presence
or absence of inflammation of the serous coat.Great distension of the
colon, of the caecum, and of the small intestines is met with in acute
intestinal catarrh of some duration, and is due to relaxation of the
muscular coat.The
calibre of the tube may be lessened by strong contraction of the
muscular layer in acute intestinal inflammation of great intensity with
early and fatal termination.The color of the exterior varies with the
tension of the wall, the color of the contents, and the amount of
vascular injection.If the bowel is much distended with gas, the color
is pale; the mingling of bile with the feces causes a yellowish or
brownish color; if blood is in the tube a dull red hue is given to the
walls.If the intestine is congested or inflamed, the vessels are
outlined distinctly and can be seen in {674} different layers.The
areas of external redness generally correspond to internal hyperaemic
patches.The serous membrane shows arborescent congestion at the
mesenteric attachment or is inflamed from perforation; the signs of
peritonitis are most marked in the neighborhood of the
irregularly-shaped, round, oval, or pin-point openings in the gut.The
abdominal cavity may contain fecal matter, food, medicines, or worms
which have passed through the perforation.The intestinal contents, instead of being homogeneous, of
pale-yellow color, and pea-soup-like appearance in the small intestine,
brown and more condensed in the lower part of the large intestine, may
present various changes.The fluid is usually increased in quantity,
and is thinner than normal in the colon: the color is greenish from the
bile, very pale from the closure of the bile-duct, red or black from
blood.The odor is absent from excess of serum, or very offensive from
decomposition due sometimes to the closure of the common bile-duct and
the want of bile.Shreds or masses of mucus may float in the liquid.Undissolved pills or drugs, as bismuth, accumulated seeds, skins of
fruits or vegetables, parasites, or foreign bodies are seen.Epithelial
cells, the debris of digestion, micrococci, and bacteria are visible
under the microscope.Inflammation involving the mucous membrane of the whole intestinal
canal is rarely or never met with.The nearest approach to generalized
catarrh of the bowel is found in eruptive fevers, especially measles.Inflammation extending throughout the whole length of either the small
or large intestine alone, and affecting all parts equally, is also
rare.The ileum is the part of the small intestine most frequently the
seat of disease, but the ileum is rarely affected alone.Inflammation
is more frequently limited to the colon than to the small intestine.The most common form of intestinal inflammation is ileo-colitis, where
the lower part of the ileum and a part of the colon, sometimes of
considerable extent, are inflamed.The duodenum is sometimes the seat
of a local inflammation, but this rarely happens except in the case of
external burns; duodenitis is most frequently an extension of catarrh
from the stomach, but the pathological anatomy of the duodenum presents
some peculiarities which will be described hereafter.(_a_) Hyperaemia of the intestinal mucous membrane may exist without
inflammation.The engorgement of the veins by mechanical retardation in
disease of the liver, heart, or lungs does not constitute catarrh,
although it is sooner or later followed by catarrhal processes, usually
of a chronic nature.Gravitation of blood to the most dependent parts
in cases of long illness distends the vessels, and post-mortem
hypostasis leads to the passage of serum and coloring matter into the
meshes of the mucous and submucous tissue.In fatal cases of acute
diarrhoea sometimes no lesion has been observed.The hyperaemic
membrane pales after death, as does the skin in scarlatina and
erysipelas.[17] The presence or absence of hyperaemia is therefore no
positive proof of the previous existence or non-existence of
inflammation.To constitute inflammation there must be other changes
besides hyperaemia, as oedema, softening, and infiltration with
cell-elements.[Footnote 17: It is difficult to recognize post-mortem hyperaemia in
the mucous membrane of the mouth or throat where intense inflammation
has been seen in life.]{675} A degree of vascular turgescence visible to the naked eye is
nearly always present in the mucous and submucous tissues which have
been the seat of catarrh.It is usually found in the lower part of the
ileum, the caecum, sigmoid flexure, and other parts of the colon.The
redness is diffused over a surface of several feet in length or is
circumscribed in patches of varying size.When vessels of small size
are distended with blood, red branching lines are seen (arborescent or
ramiform injection) which have their starting-point in the insertion of
the mesentery.When the capillary system is engorged a fine interlacing
network can be discovered, which gives to the membrane a more uniform
red color.Parallel lines or bands of redness extend in a transverse
direction across the axis of the canal corresponding to the folds of
mucous membrane in the small and large intestine.The shades of color depend upon the intensity and duration of the
congestion.In acute mild forms the color is light red; in more intense
grades the membrane is more vivid or purplish.Brown and slate-
tints show a passage into the chronic stage.A black hue occurs in
gangrenous inflammation.Minute dots (speckled redness) are due to
minute extravasations, and ecchymotic irregular patches are sometimes
seen.Bile-staining of the mucous surface is met with; this cannot be removed
by washing.In metallic poisoning the redness is more vivid and the
mucous membrane is eroded.[18]

[Footnote 18: For  plates illustrating hyperaemia and
inflammation of the intestines see Carswell, _Path.Anat._, London,
1838, plate ii.These are beautiful representations of
(1) ramiform vascular injection passing into (2) capilliform injection,
which becomes (3) uniformly red, or from its intensity (4) ecchymotic
or hemorrhagic.See also Annesley, _Morbid Anatomy_, London, 1828,
plates x.2), xiii., xxii., xxiv., and xxv.Many of these are
illustrations of peritonitis as a complication of enteritis.See also
Kupferlafelnzer, Lesser, _Ueber die entzundung und Verschwarung der
Schleimhaut des Verdauungskals_, Berlin, 1830, tab.3; also J.
Hope, _Illustrations of Morbid Anatomy_, London, 1834, figs.116, 118,
124, and 125.These plates are wonderful in their truthfulness and
execution.](_b_) Acute oedema and increase in the cell-elements in the inflamed
parts give rise to swelling and to softening, so that the mucous
membrane seems to be easily scraped off.This is not always the case,
as no loss of firmness of the reddened tissue is often found.In the
small intestine the villi, which in health are not seen, become
enlarged, giving a "plush-like" or velvety appearance to the mucous
membrane; they are sometimes club-shaped from epithelial accumulations
on their free extremities.(_c_) When the small intestine is examined the solitary glands, which
in the normal state are barely visible, are so enlarged that they
appear as rounded prominences.They are described as looking like
grains of mustard-seed on a red ground, and are the size of pinheads.When they are distinctly seen it may be concluded that they are
enlarged.In children the glands are enlarged when there has been
slight or no diarrhoea.Peyer's patches are also tumefied, and are more distinct from being
elevated above the surface, but they have not in intestinal catarrh as
great a relative enlargement when compared with the solitary glands as
in typhoid fever.The interfollicular substance of the patch may
hypertrophy without any increase in the size of the follicles; a
reticulated {676} appearance is then given to the gland.The color of
the swollen follicles in recent inflammation is translucent from
oedema; later they are gray and opaque.These changes are more marked
at the lower end of the ileum, because the isolated follicles and
Peyer's patches are more numerous there.(_d_) Catarrhal ulcers--erosions--are produced by the loss of
epithelium or from a process of vesicle-forming and rupture, as in
stomatitis.They may enlarge, undermine, and coalesce, thus reaching
quite a large size.They may deepen and perforate the wall of the
bowel, causing peritonitis, or they may heal, forming cicatrices which
in contracting may narrow the canal.Small follicular ulcers are found on the mucous surface.They result
from the breaking down of the exposed wall of the closed follicle from
over-distension.The ulcer is either on the apex of the dome of an
isolated follicle or is within the area of a Peyer's patch.Sometimes
several ulcers may be seen on the surface of the swollen patch.[19] The
ulcerative process is sometimes very rapid.In the case of a child aged
eight years, with no previous intestinal disease, who died in the
Children's Hospital, Washington, in June, 1882, after a two days'
illness with watery discharges and rapid prostration, the solitary
glands throughout the ileum were many of them enlarged.As many as a
dozen small ulcers were seen at the apices of the enlarged follicles.[Footnote 19: See photograph facing page 302 of _Med.In the large intestine the same lesions are found, but in a more
advanced stage, especially in the caecum and descending colon.Enlarged
solitary glands of the size of a pinhead or small bird-shot are
scattered along the canal.Follicular ulcers[20] are found in the large intestine, occupying the
summit of the enlarged follicles and involving a large extent of mucous
surface.Pigment-deposits are seen which give rise to the appearances
described as occurring in chronic intestinal catarrh.[Footnote 20: For description of the mode of formation and growth of
follicular ulcers see article on CHRONIC INTESTINAL CATARRH.](_e_) The mucous surface is covered, especially in the areas of
redness, with an adhesive, opaque mucus of neutral or alkaline reaction
and of yellow, red, or brown hue, depending upon the relative amount of
bile or blood.It is composed of mucus-corpuscles, epithelium-cells of
cylindrical and prismatic form, pus-cells, and sometimes
blood-corpuscles.Vibrios and bacteria also are seen.The chief distinction between the lesions of acute intestinal catarrh
and typhoid fever are these: In typhoid fever the number of Peyer's
patches involved is larger; there will be a chain of enlarged glands
from the ileo-caecal valve throughout the ileum, those nearest the
ileum being the most altered.Near the valve there is usually some
ulceration, so that the gland acquires a ragged appearance.In catarrh
of the bowel there is a more irregular distribution of enlarged glands;
they project less above the surface, and if ulcerated have one or two
spots of erosion.In typhoid fever the Peyer's patch has the most
prominence.In catarrh of the bowel the solitary glands are the most
enlarged.In catarrh the large intestine may be the seat of the most
advanced lesion; in typhoid fever, except with rare exceptions, the
lesions in the ileum are most advanced.{677} (_f_) The mesenteric glands are enlarged, but not so uniformly so
or to the same extent as in typhoid fever.The stomach is sometimes
found inflamed, the mucous membrane being reddened, thickened, or
softened.The liver, spleen, and kidneys are normal or present
accidental conditions of disease.In the respiratory organs pulmonary
congestion, pleurisy, and pneumonia are found.The heart contains clots
which are fibrinous or soft and red; they are found on both sides, but
when one cavity alone is filled the right is the common seat.The brain
is usually normal; fluid may be in the subarachnoid space, and thrombi
in the cerebral sinuses.PATHOLOGICAL HISTOLOGY.--In the genesis of catarrh of the intestinal
mucous membrane the first effect of the exciting cause is an
over-distension of the capillaries and small vessels; this congestion
is most marked in the meshwork of vessels around the closed follicles.A transudation of serum takes place into the mucous layer, and in more
marked congestion into the submucous layer also; these tissues become
more or less oedematous and swollen.Transudation of serum into the
intestinal tube follows.From over-stretching the walls of minute
vessels may rupture and small extravasations take place, staining the
tissue red.Post-mortem
extravasations are due to decomposition of the wall of the vessel.Rupture of vessels on the surface leads to escape of blood into the
bowel, which is mixed with the transuded serum.The proper secretion,
intestinal juice, is diminished as a result of these changes, but an
excess of the mucus with which the mucous membrane is always coated
immediately follows.The origin of the mucus is not to be sought for in
the activity of the glands alone, but in the transformation of the
protoplasm of the epithelial cells.[21] The varying proportions of
serum, mucus, and blood cause the stools to be serous, mucous, slimy,
or bloody, hence the terms serous, mucous, and bloody diarrhoea.[Footnote 21: Rindfleisch, _Path.Histology_, Sydenham ed., vol.Hypernutrition, swift life of the mucous membrane, the result of
continued excess of blood, entails the increase of the cell-elements.Lymphoid cells accumulate in the submucous layer, especially where
these cells are normally most numerous.There is a saturation of the
membrane with an excess of plasma.Cells also appear in increasing
numbers in the interfibrillary spaces of the mucous membrane, which
increase its bulk, and the follicles of Lieberkuhn appear as if pushed
apart.Lymph-corpuscles accumulate in the meshes of the closed
follicles, which are distended and project above the surface as
described.Multiplication of the cells within the follicle (follicular
suppuration) causes over-stretching and the wall bursts, forming the
first stage of the follicular ulcer.The appearance upon the epithelial
surface of an increased number of loosened cells, which are sometimes
epithelial in character and at other times resembling pus-cells
(epithelial and purulent catarrh), is believed to be due to a rapid
manufacture and exfoliation of epithelial elements, and to constitute
one of the essential features of catarrh.Desquamation of the
epithelium in catarrh of the bowel, even in that of Asiatic cholera,
has been called in question by Woodward, who thinks that the stripping
off of epithelium is cadaveric.SYMPTOMS.--Owing to the difference in the intensity and extent of {678}
the catarrhal process there is every possible variation in the symptoms
of intestinal inflammation.No one symptomatic picture will properly
represent all cases, and with a view to greater convenience and
exactitude of illustration a division may be made into mild and severer
forms.Under the head of mild forms can be included all cases of intestinal
catarrh which by their short duration and benignant character point to
a mild degree of inflammation.They correspond to the following
anatomical states: hyperaemia of the mucous membrane of parts of the
small or large intestine, or of parts of both simultaneously; slight or
moderate swelling of the membrane from serous saturation; transudation
of serum into the canal; increase of lymphoid cells in the mucous and
submucous tissues; and increased manufacture of epithelial cells, but
without any marked tumefaction or ulceration of the closed follicles.The termination is by resolution, which is reached in a few days
usually, and the membrane is rapidly and entirely restored to the
normal state.Between the normal condition of the mucous membrane, with
its recurring periods of physiological hyperaemia, and the hyperaemia
with exaggerated secretion and peristalsis which leads to diarrhoea,
there is no well-defined border-line.Diarrhoea may be regarded as the
most certain sign of the catarrhal process.Whenever the frequency and
fluidity of the stools are such as to be regarded as pathological, some
stage or other of catarrhal inflammation may be assumed to exist.In a large number of mild forms the onset is sudden.After a meal of
indigestible food or an unusual excess pain will be felt in the
abdomen, recurring in paroxysms, which start in the neighborhood of the
umbilicus and radiate throughout the abdomen.The pain is accompanied
by borborygmi, and is succeeded sooner or later by a desire to go to
stool.The first one or two movements, which follow each other in quick
succession, are more or less consistent or moulded, but in a short time
diarrhoea is established by frequent discharges of watery fluid,
containing perhaps some undigested fragments of food, which may have
been the exciting cause of the illness by mechanical irritation.Each
stool is preceded by colics, griping pains in the abdomen, which are
relieved by the evacuation.An attack beginning in this way and from
such causes may cease in a few hours, and be unattended by any general
symptoms if proper precautions are taken.A slight dryness and coating
of the tongue, with loss of appetite and occasional griping pains or a
tendency to looseness of the stools, may continue for a day or two.Indiscretions in diet or other imprudences, as fatigue, may prolong the
mildest attack during one or more weeks, but the character of the
illness is here due not to the nature of the disease, but to the
addition of fresh causes which delay the natural progress toward
recovery.Severer forms either begin suddenly, as in the milder forms just
described, or are preceded for a time by symptoms of gastric or
intestinal indigestion.The patient may have complained of distress
after eating, flatulence, colicky pains, distension of the abdomen and
tenderness on pressure, loss of appetite, with a general feeling of
ill-health--symptoms which point to the existence of a condition of the
mucous membrane of the gastro-intestinal canal favorable to the action
of an exciting cause.A feeling of chilliness ushers in the attack.This is accompanied by
fever, which at first, and sometimes throughout, is of a marked
remittent type.{679} The griping pains, colics, which at first are
infrequent and dull, now recur at short intervals and become sharper.They are sometimes attended with vomiting of food or of a greenish
fluid.The intensity of suffering may be so great as to cause pallor of
the countenance, a feeling of faintness, and coldness of the surface
with sweating.The paroxysm usually precedes a movement.The more
severe pains extend to the lower extremities and the scrotum.Movement of gas in the intestines produces rumbling, gurgling, or
splashing sounds, called borborygmi.They are paroxysmal, lasting a few
moments, or are coincident with pain, and frequently are the immediate
precursors of an evacuation.The cause for their production is the
quick propulsion of the fluids by strong peristaltic action from one
part of the bowel to the other or the rapid movement of gas within the
bowel.Relief is obtained both from the pain and from the sense of
distension by expulsion of flatus.Tympanites is closely connected with the symptoms just described.An
excess of gases within the bowel is not primarily a result of the
inflammation of the mucous membrane, but is an early phenomenon due to
the decomposition of indigestible food in its transit through the
intestine.Later, the gases are developed very readily by the
decomposition of even the most digestible articles of food, the mucus,
which is the product of the catarrh, acting as a ferment.The distension of the intestinal canal produces an intumescence of the
abdomen which is commonly uniform, but may be greater in some portions
of the tract than in others.Thus the transverse and descending colon
are more projecting and more distinctly outlined than other portions of
the canal.Sensibility of the abdomen to pressure exists along the line of the
colon or over a considerable area.But no defined limitation of the
affected part can usually be made by the location of pain to the touch.If there is any local tenderness, it is over the descending colon.In
one form of enteritis--typhlitis--the localization of the inflammation
in the caecum produces subjective pain and pain on pressure in a
restricted region--a peculiarity which results no doubt from the early
intensity of the inflammation and the implication of the connective
tissue behind the bowel.But this is not true of inflammation of any
other part of the intestinal canal.A sensation of soreness on movement, as in turning in bed, standing, or
walking, is not uncommon, even when the attack is of no great gravity.The patient on standing bends forward to relieve tension, and he may
feel nervous when the bed is shaken.Diarrhoea is the most important symptom, as it is directly related to
catarrh.The number of evacuations varies from one or two to twenty or
more in the day.In cases of medium intensity there are from six to ten
in twenty-four hours, the interval between the movements being two to
three hours during the day and somewhat longer at night.The matters
passed in quantity range from two ounces to a pint; the average is
about four fluidounces.This, however, is subject to great variations,
depending upon the intensity of the disease; the more choleriform the
attack the greater the amount of fluid passed.The weight of the
evacuations varies from five ounces to forty pounds in twenty-four
hours; this increase does not depend upon the greater quantity of water
only, but the solid constituents are in greater amount.{680} The normal brown color, which is due to hydrobilirubin, changes
as the movements become thinner to yellowish-brown or pale yellow from
dilution of the fecal matter with water.An excess of serum or mucus
renders them colorless.A greenish-brown, greenish-yellow, or green hue
is due to the presence of bile.The rapid descent of the contents of
the bowel delays or prevents the reabsorption of bile,[22] or the fluid
is expelled before the usual transformations in color take place.[23]
The bile-pigment is also absent in duodenal catarrh from closure of the
opening of the ductus choledochus.[Footnote 22: L. Brunton, "On the Action of Purgative Medicines," _The
Practitioner_, London, June, 1874, p.[Footnote 23: The reaction of bile-pigment with nitric acid, which does
not take place in the contents of the colon or in normal feces, is seen
in the green stools of acute intestinal catarrh, especially in
children.]The coloration of the stools further depends upon the character of the
food and drink and upon the drugs given.From an exclusive milk diet
the discharges are pale or contain undigested whitish lumps of casein.The preparations of bismuth and iron give a black color and the
sulphate of copper a dark-green hue.A green or greenish-brown tint is
observed after the use of calomel, and while the experiments of the
Edinburgh committee demonstrated that no increase of bile follows its
administration in dogs, yet the opinion is still general that the green
stools contain an excess of bile.Blood appears in three forms in the stools: as a coffee-ground or black
powder from hemorrhage in the stomach or upper bowel; as a reddish
fluid with small coagula in flakes, which come from intense congestion
or ulceration of the intestine; or an abundant hemorrhage may result
from deep ulceration in the duodenum or elsewhere.The characteristic odor of the feces is altered in several ways.As the
movements become less solid they acquire a nauseous or sour smell, due
essentially to the volatile products formed in connection with the
decomposition of fatty matters.[24] When very thin and containing
little or no feculent matter the discharges lose odor, as in cholera,
or they become excessively offensive--cadaveric--in intense and fatal
inflammation and in ulceration of the bowels.After exposure to the air
the stools of diarrhoea undergo decomposition and develop offensive
smells more rapidly than in health.The absence of bile, whether there
is diarrhoea or not, gives rise to a peculiar and unpleasant odor,
showing that this secretion is to some extent an antiseptic.The escape
of fetid gas from the anus is rarely an accompaniment of a decomposed
state of the rectal contents.In children the stools are more variable
in quantity, color, and odor than in adults, and are more readily
affected by the ingesta.[Footnote 24: Guttmann, _Physical Diagnosis_, Sydenham Soc.The odor of normal feces is due to a substance isolated by
Briequer, called scatol, which is a final product of the putrefaction
of albumen (Ewald, _Lectures on Digestion_, New York, 1881, p.In the diarrhoea of old persons the discharges are thin, yellow,
offensive, and often frothy.The disorder of the digestive apparatus is attended with other
symptoms.The tongue is normal in some cases; in others red at the
point and edges with a central whitish coat, or the surface is red,
polished, and dry.Marked change in the appearance of the tongue is due
to a complicating gastric catarrh.There is thirst, with loss of
appetite, and a tendency to {681} nausea and vomiting in children and
feeble persons.The breath has a peculiarly offensive odor (spoken of
as fecal) in some instances.In cases of moderate severity it occurs in
the beginning of the illness, but declines rapidly under treatment by
rest and diet.The course of fever does not conform to any type even in
severe cases, although it so nearly resembles that of typhoid fever in
its first week as to lead to mistakes in diagnosis.The height of the
fever and its duration are measures of the extent of the lesions and
their gravity.Sudden outbursts of fever point to some complication.In
catarrh of the bowel due to cold the fever is higher than when
indigestion is the cause.In very feeble persons, in children, and in
any case from neglect and improper feeding the body-heat may be very
high.Very little disturbance of
the nervous system is seen except in young and old patients; some
headache and restlessness are all that may be observed.Moderate
delirium at night accompanies very acute attacks.In children
convulsions are not unusual in the onset and at the end of the attack.In the aged exhaustion from the illness soon lapses into stupor or
coma.Paraplegia and contraction of the muscles of the extremities are
referred by some observers to gastro-intestinal inflammation.[25]

[Footnote 25: Potain, _Le Praticien_, Paris, 1879-80, p.In uncomplicated mild cases of intestinal catarrh there is a movement
toward recovery after a few days' illness.The stools become less
frequent, smaller, and more consistent.In a week to ten days the
tongue cleans, the thirst ceases, the appetite returns, the tympanites
and pain diminish.The fever declines, and ceases before the diarrhoea
is completely arrested.There are always more or less emaciation and
loss of strength from the fever and arrest of nutrition.The liability
to relapse is great, and the patient by indiscretions reproduces the
same symptoms, thus prolonging the attack for several weeks.Acute
intestinal catarrh may pass into the chronic form by a disappearance of
fever and amelioration of all the abdominal symptoms.The patient
begins to take solid food, gains strength and flesh, but complete
recovery does not come.The diarrhoea recurs at variable intervals as
the result of indulgences in a mixed diet, over-exercise, or exposure
to cold, and in time we have some degree of chronic catarrh permanently
established.Very mild cases may be prolonged by the neglect of the patient to
consider his painless diarrhoea of sufficient moment to need attention.In inflammation of the more intense kind the picture is somewhat
different.The prodromes are longer and the general symptoms more
severe.Restlessness, a sense of prostration, delirium, and high fever
mark the early stages and continue for a longer time.The patient loses
flesh and strength quickly.The features express anxiety and illness,
the skin is hot and dry, and the thirst great.Borborygmi, the tension of the abdomen, pain, and sensibility to
pressure are all intensified.The stools are at first yellow and thin,
but change much from day to day.They may be green or very thin and
dark or grayish, and are sometimes very offensive in odor.Blood and
mucus may be seen in them, being slimy or grumous and bloody.When the
patient is very weak the discharges are involuntary; the tongue is
coated white, with bright red tip and edges, and is often dry.{682} The severer forms last from three to six weeks.After a tedious
period of alternate improvement and relapse the illness becomes chronic
or the patient dies from asthenia, perforation and peritonitis, or some
other complication.In the most intense varieties which find examples among Europeans and
Americans in intertropical countries, or result from acute mineral
poisoning and from rapidly-progressing cases of acute ulceration of the
intestinal wall, especially in children, there is a sharper and more
violent invasion.The strength is reduced in a very short time, and
there is rapid emaciation; the features assume an anxious expression;
the complexion is leaden or livid; the skin is cold and clammy; the
pulse is small, weak, and rapid; the breath comes quick and short, and
is frequently complicated with hiccough.In the early stages vomiting
occurs, due to a concurrent gastritis; in cases of poisoning vomiting
is incessant.The pain in the abdomen is intense, and less paroxysmal than in other
forms.The abdomen is tympanitic and excessively tender to the touch,
and the knees are drawn up to relieve the tension of the abdominal
muscles.Thin, black, or reddish stools are passed every few moments.As the attack progresses the urine is suppressed, the voice becomes
whispering, and collapse is developed.This is marked by cold
extremities, dyspnoea, feeble and finally imperceptible pulse.Death
may end the scene in a few hours or the patient may rally and recover
slowly.Choleriform diarrhoea occurs chiefly in children during hot weather.VARIETIES DUE TO SEAT.--The symptoms and progress of acute catarrh of
the intestines present numerous differences depending upon the seat of
the inflammation.The symptomatology already given is that of the most
common form (ileo-colitis), in which the lower part of the ileum and a
considerable portion of the colon are simultaneously involved.Many
cases no doubt occur in which the disease is limited and in which early
recovery is the rule.The pathological anatomy of cases of generalized
catarrh is better known, as they form the bulk of the fatal cases.I. Acute Duodenitis.--The most common form of duodenitis is that in
which the inflammation spreads by continuity of tissue from the stomach
to the duodenum, as in acute gastric catarrh after a debauch.The
prominence of the gastric symptoms disguises the intestinal lesion,
unless the catarrh, as is frequently the case, extends into and
obstructs the common bile-duct and its branches, and suddenly develops
icterus with clayey stools and altered urine.Besides icterus, a
careful isolation of symptoms will show that some cannot be attributed
to the stomach: there is a dull pain seated in the right hypochondrium,
extending to the right shoulder or shoulder-blade, which is increased
by pressure upon the region of the duodenum.As the gastric symptoms
improve there is no change in the icterus, which continues for some
days or weeks longer.The connection between burns of the integument
and ulcer of the duodenum is well known.Symptoms of perforation, with
death, may be the first sign of this lesion, but vomiting of blood,
icterus, purging of blood, indigestion, and cardialgia occur from
duodenal ulcers.The typical acute duodenitis described by authors as an independent
{683} affection is of rare occurrence.An epidemic of duodenitis[26]
has been reported where many persons were simultaneously attacked, all
the cases having had the same traits--headache, pain in the line of the
duodenum at the left edge of the right hypochondrium, pain in the first
and second lumbar vertebrae, constipation, jaundice, slow pulse, and
mental depression.Gangrenous inflammation of the duodenum[27] has been
once seen, and produced a chill, a severe sense of weight and pain in
the epigastrium, retching and eructations of gas, tenderness on
pressure, frequent pulse, and high temperature.There was obstinate
constipation, with dyspnoea, death ensuing in a few days.At the
autopsy gangrenous inflammation of the duodenum was found, which ended
abruptly twelve inches from the pylorus.There was a large gall-stone
in the gall-bladder.[Footnote 26: McGaughey, _Philada.407; also, T. N. Reynolds, _Detroit Clinic_, June 7, 1882, p.[Footnote 27: Eskridge, _Philada.A fatal case of duodenitis is recorded[28] in which the following
symptoms were observed: sudden and severe pain in the right
hypochondrium, increased by pressure; rigors, vomiting and purging of a
green flocculent fluid, and later of blood; jaundice, fever, delirium,
collapse, and death.The pylorus and two-thirds of the duodenal mucous
membrane were much inflamed and the orifice of the bile-duct closed.[Footnote 28: _Die Krankheiten des Duodenums_, Mayer, quoted by Leube
in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, Am.Acute Ileitis, Acute Jejunitis.--When the ileum, with or without
the jejunum, is the seat of catarrh, diarrhoea may not be present,
provided the inflammation is slight and there is no increase of colon
peristalsis.The symptoms then are borborygmi, pain and fulness about
and below the umbilicus or between it and the right ileum, especially
after eating, and the general symptoms arising from indigestion and
malnutrition.Fever is slight or absent; there are malaise and loss of
strength.They contain unaltered
bile and fragments of muscular fibre and starch-granules in excess of
the quantity found in health.An increased quantity of mucus, diffused
evenly in a fluid evacuation, or globules of mucus stained with bile,
or bile-stained epithelium, denote inflammation confined to the small
intestine.A larger amount of indican in the urine than is normally
present is a sign of the same lesion.[29]

[Footnote 29: These conclusions are based upon the results of one
thousand examinations of feces made by H. Nothnagel, and reported in
_Zur Klinik der Darmkrankheiten; Zeitschrift fur klin.Medicin_, iv.,
1882, p.Intense inflammation of the small intestine may exist without diarrhoea
or other symptoms betokening the real nature of the attack.Flint[30]
mentions having met with three such instances, and Goodhart[31] records
thirteen cases of enteritis with marked lesions in which no diagnosis
had been made before death.Rilliet and Barthez report twenty-four
autopsies in children with intestinal lesions in which no symptoms had
been observed.[32]

[Footnote 30: _Clinical Medicine_, Philada., 1879, p.[Footnote 31: _Guy's Hospital Gazette_, Sept., 1878, p.98 _et seq._]

[Footnote 32: _Maladies des Enfants_, Paris, 1861, tome i. p.Acute Colitis.--Fifty years ago colitis was synonymous with
enteritis, and not with dysentery, as at a more recent date.[33] The
older {684} signification expressed the fact that inflammation in the
colon is essential to diarrhoea.Later the term was used synonymously
with dysentery.[34]

[Footnote 33: _Journal general de Medecine_, Paris, 1825, t. xci.[Footnote 34: Tweedie, _System of the Practice of Medicine_, 1841.]The colon is a conducting tube; the contents are composed of matters
unabsorbed in the small intestines.At first the mass entering the
colon is fluid, but by the gradual absorption of its watery part it
approaches solidity.The discharge from the rectum of a fluid shows
that the propulsion through the large intestine is so rapid that the
process of drying does not take place, or that from inflammation of the
colon there is an excess of fluid transudation from the intestinal
wall.The superficial position of the colon, its great size and length,
expose it to the action of external cold, to blows, etc.In catarrh limited to the colon there are essentially the same symptoms
as in ileo-colitis, inasmuch as the inflammation of the colon gives to
that form its characteristic features--borborygmi, diarrhoea, and
tympanites.When the disease in the colon preponderates or exists
alone, the pain and tenderness are more superficial and confined to the
line of the large intestine.The distended colon projects and the
abdominal swelling is not so uniform.If the attack is subacute or
mild, the stools contain normal feces mixed with a great deal of mucus;
when the inflammation is in the sigmoid flexure, pure mucus is passed.Blood mixed with mucus and tenesmus accompany inflammation low down.Blood may, however, come from intense inflammation of the ascending and
transverse colon without disease of the lower bowel.[35]

[Footnote 35: In a case seen by the writer of colitis terminating
fatally from perforation of the transverse colon this point was
illustrated.A woman aged fifty was taken with diarrhoea in August,
1873.In November the symptoms became worse: tongue dry and red;
abdominal pain; tympanites; frequent stools, ten to seventeen in
twenty-four hours; quantity large, of a yellow or brownish-red color
with floating flakes.General symptoms grew worse; blood in stools from
time to time.November 24, sudden cessation of discharges from the
bowels, and the following day sudden collapse and death.Autopsy:
Descending colon and sigmoid flexure comparatively healthy.Transverse
colon adherent to stomach; deposits of lymph on colon and small
intestines; fluid and feces in the peritoneal cavity.The mucous
membrane of the ascending and transverse colon in a state of black
pulpy disintegration.In the transverse colon the walls were thinned by
ulceration and easily torn; gangrenous appearance of mucous coat;
perforation of the colon wall below greater curvature of the stomach.]Proctitis.--The rectum may be the seat of simple catarrh, which
differs in its symptoms from catarrh of other portions of the canal.By
many this form is called simple, non-infective dysentery.But as it is
a form of intestinal catarrh, it is right that it should be considered
in connection with colitis.The first indication of its onset is a
frequent desire to go to stool, with an unsatisfied feeling after each
effort.Normal fecal matter is first expelled in solid form, coated
with mucus which may be streaked with blood.Soon, however, the
discharges consist of jelly-like mucus, alone or mixed with blood.A
small quantity of this is passed with tenesmus at short intervals.The
patient complains of a burning feeling in the rectum and a constant and
irresistible desire to strain.The same spasmodic contraction may
involve the bladder.It usually ends in
recovery spontaneously or under treatment by the cessation of the mucus
and blood and the discharge of normal fecal matter.DIAGNOSIS.--A combination of the symptoms described as belonging to
inflammation of the small and large intestine gives the most common
{685} form of intestinal catarrh, ileo-colitis.This union is diagnosed
by the following symptoms: fever; general distension of the abdomen;
paroxysmal pains starting from the umbilicus, but having a general
distribution; noisy movements of gas; diarrhoea, the stools being
large, thin, stained more or less with bile, containing more or less
mucus intimately mixed with fluid matter and with particles of
partially-digested or unaltered food.It is possible in many cases to
recognize the part of the intestinal canal which is the seat of disease
from differences in symptoms which have already been described.But
great care in observation is needed, combined with a minute inspection
and microscopical examination of the stools, to arrive at accurate and
well-founded conclusions.Acute follicular ulceration may be thought to have begun if after a
week or more of illness thin and sometimes putrescent stools are passed
containing small blood-coagula, with mucus and pus.[36] This opinion
would be confirmed by an increase in abdominal tenderness and the
persistence of the diarrhoea or tendency to relapse notwithstanding
careful treatment and diet.The transition of the disease into the
chronic form would give additional support to this view of the nature
of the lesion.[37]

[Footnote 36: "The intestinal mucous membrane, especially that of the
small intestine, scarcely ever produces pus without ulceration"
(Virchow's _Cellular Pathology_, Philada., 1863, p.[Footnote 37: For a more detailed account of the symptoms and diagnosis
of follicular ulceration see article on CHRONIC INTESTINAL CATARRH.]Some or all of the symptoms of acute intestinal catarrh are, however,
found in other diseases.It is well, therefore, to devote some
attention to differential diagnosis, giving a resume of the salient
points of distinction.Typhoid fever in many of its features resembles intestinal catarrh, and
in many cases is confounded with it.Until within quite recent times
the symptoms of typhoid fever were grouped under the names
gastro-enteritis and follicular enteritis.In the first week of the
illness there is reasonable ground for delay in making a positive
diagnosis.Etiological data are here of great help.The occurrence of
the symptoms in children under two years and in adults beyond fifty
years points strongly to intestinal catarrh.Spring and early summer
are the seasons for diarrhoea; typhoid belongs to late summer and to
autumn.A sudden onset after errors in diet or exposure to cold, with
the early development of pain in the bowels, rumbling of gas,
diarrhoea, would be easily recognized as a local disorder.In typhoid
fever there is a less sudden onset, with prodromal debility, anaemia,
indigestion, and nocturnal fever.To these symptoms the diarrhoea,
which is attended with little or no pain, plays a very subordinate
part.In many cases of mild typhoid the development is sudden, with
rigors.A week's study of the temperature, if no rose-spots appear,
will be needed before the diagnosis can be made.There is not much
difficulty in making the distinction when the attack has reached its
second week.At this period in catarrh of the bowel the high fever,
with regular morning remissions and evening exacerbations, is not
constant, as in typhoid fever; there is tenderness on pressure over the
abdomen and gurgling, but no great meteorism; sibilant rales are not
heard in the chest; there are no rose-spots; rarely cerebral symptoms
except insomnia; and delirium is uncommon.The prostration is proportioned to the diarrhoea, and is by no means as
{686} great as at the same period in enteric fever.The colicky pains
preceding and accompanying the stools are a more marked feature of
intestinal catarrh; they are absent in enteric fever or have a feeble
intensity.In children between the ages of two and seven years there are certain
peculiarities which augment the difficulties of diagnosis.Intestinal
catarrh in them is accompanied by an abundant, frequently painless
diarrhoea, by tympanites, cerebral disturbances, a dry and coated
tongue, with sordes on the lips and gums, and by a rapidly-developed
anaemia, emaciation, and exhaustion.Typhoid fever in children of this
age is generally benignant; vomiting is more common than in adults;
high grades of meteorism are infrequent; tenderness of the caecal
region is determined with greater difficulty; and severe nervous
phenomena and fatal intestinal complications rarely occur.[38] In other
words, in young children intestinal catarrh by its severity and enteric
fever by its benignity more nearly approach each other than in adults;
in many instances the diagnosis must be undecided until late in the
attack.[Footnote 38: Consult "Diseases of Children," Henoch, _Wood's Library_,
New York, 1882, p.Typhoid fever can of course be known if rose-spots, a splenic tumor, or
the characteristic delirium are manifested, or if the fever-curve
conforms to the type; but in children all these symptoms may be
negative; even the fever has great variability.If fever is continued
beyond ten days, and is accompanied by progressive anaemia and
emaciation and debility, the attack is enteric fever if all local
causes of fever can be excluded.There is no minimum limit to the
temperature in typhoid fever, and no matter how low the maxima of the
fastigium may be, typhoid fever cannot be excluded.[39]

[Footnote 39: Johnston, "On the Diagnosis of Mild Cases of Typhoid
Fever," _Am.Sci._, Oct., 1875, p.372; also, "On the Mild
Forms of Continued Fever in Washington," _Am.Sci._, Oct.,
1882, p.The large watery stools and the absence of tenesmus mark the difference
between diarrhoea and dysentery.Blood may be present in colitis, owing
to a high grade of inflammation and to ulceration.Simple catarrh of
the rectum, proctitis, is not readily distinguished from infective
dysentery.Small mucous and bloody stools may be catarrhal.In the
present state of our knowledge dysentery would be known by marked
tenesmus, by the grave general symptoms, the reddish fluid stools with
flocculi, and by its occurrence in epidemic form.Enteralgia presents the following features which distinguish it from
intestinal catarrh: The tongue in enteralgia is clean or coated white,
but with no red tip and edges; the appetite is capricious, but not
lost; the bowels are constipated; the pain bears no relation to the
ingestion of food or drink, as in enteritis.Fever is accidental, and
there are other nervous phenomena.In lead colic there is no fever,
tympanites, nor diarrhoea.In rheumatism of the abdominal walls the
pain is superficial and sharp, not griping, and is increased by
movements of the trunk.The digestive system is in no way disordered.From peritonitis intestinal catarrh is distinguished by a less degree
of illness and by its usually favorable result, by diarrhoea, a greater
freedom in movement, and by a less degree of suffering on palpating the
abdomen.Tympanites, constipation, great tenderness on pressure over
the abdomen, and a small, quick pulse, point to peritonitis.{687} PROGNOSIS.--A simple intestinal catarrh of the form first
described involves no danger, and if treated by rest and diet soon
recovers.The more severe form, beginning as a primary disease, when
rationally treated ends in recovery in most instances.Unfavorable predisposing causes are--a hot climate (India, the West
Indies, and intertropical climates in general); very hot weather of the
summer and autumn months; a very early or very advanced age; the
contaminated atmosphere of prisons, camps, etc.; all bad hygienic
influences; and previous or coexisting illness.When diarrhoea occurs
as a complication of the acute infectious diseases it has a special
gravity.In typhoid fever, scarlatina, measles, acute tuberculosis,
etc.During the progress
of chronic general diseases (malaria, scurvy, tuberculosis) it becomes
an obstinate and sometimes a fatal complication.Among the exciting
causes mineral poisons induce the most dangerous form of intestinal
catarrh.Unfavorable symptoms occurring during the course of acute
diarrhoea are the early development of high temperature, cerebral
disturbance, great sensibility to pressure over the abdomen, thin and
bloody or highly offensive stools, involuntary discharges, and very
rapid emaciation and loss of strength.TREATMENT.--There have been many fluctuations of opinion as to the
relative value of modes of treatment in this disease.Various
therapeutic measures have been suggested which, after enjoying favor
for a time, have been abandoned, and revived after long periods of
disfavor.Venesection was alternately recommended and forbidden.Emetics and evacuants, mercurials, diuretics, diaphoretics, have been
in turn warmly supported and vigorously opposed.Opium, belladonna, the
various astringents, and cinchona-bark have run through many changes of
favor.Individual drugs give curious evidence of inconstancy.Oxide of
zinc, suggested by James Adair in 1785 and by Hendy in 1784, after a
hundred years of weak approval is commended highly by Penrose (1863),
Brakenridge, and Mackey (1873),[40] and by more recent writers.Acetate
of lead, which dates back to Paracelsus, had varying fortunes of repute
and disrepute.In the end of the seventeenth century it had a name for
curing diarrhoea, but in the following century it was spoken of by
Boerhaave as a deceitful and destructive poison, and Cullen in 1789
said that hardly any one then thought of using lead internally.[41] In
1799 it had warm advocates in this country; among them, Thomas Ewall of
Washington, who wrote in 1808.Since then it has come into very general
use and favor, which it still holds.[Footnote 40: J. J. Woodward, _op.780 _et seq._]

In view of the many changes of faith in systems of treatment and in
drugs, we have no right to assume that we have as yet reached the
perfection of treatment.In fact, experience brings the conviction that
our systems are quite imperfect and that drugs fail in our hands when
they are most needed.The prophylactic treatment is of importance, especially in children,
delicate persons, and in those suffering from disease or predisposed by
idiosyncrasy to intestinal catarrh.Directions must be given by the
physician as to the food for children appropriate to their age and
digestive capacity.Summer heat and city life being so fatal to them,
they should {688} be sent to the cool climate of the seashore or
mountains during the first and second years of life.In warm weather
laxatives should not be given to children, except with precautions
against their acting too freely; the same rule applies to the aged.Too
great care in diet in older children predisposes to indigestion and
diarrhoea.Variety in food is of service, therefore.It is not well to
give children food prepared so as to do away with the necessity for
mastication and for active gastric movements.All reasonable care should be used not to take
food in excess of the individual's power of digestion.Unripe fruit,
stale vegetables or fruits, cheese, pork, shellfish which are not
absolutely fresh, are among the aliments which may produce diarrhoea,
and are to be avoided.Many people have to be told what food is
unsuited to them, and certain articles of food in individual cases
invariably excite diarrhoea.Alcohol is often to be blamed for
diarrhoeas which are attributed to indigestible food, and frequent
recurrences of intestinal catarrh can only be prevented by abandoning
stimulants altogether.The bad effects of sudden changes in temperature
are warded off by wearing flannel next to the body.This is an
important rule for adults as for children.Even in summer thin flannel
or gauze gives protection.Well-ventilated rooms, good house-drainage,
personal cleanliness, with all other hygienic aids, are means of
prevention.Persistent disinfection of sources of air- and
water-contamination should be practised, especially in hot weather.In
the country the open privies and wells need frequent clearing out.Cases of fatal diarrhoea are met with in elevated regions where the
continued low temperature renders it improbable that heat could have
anything to do with their causation.[42] Water should not be used which
could in any way be tainted with soakage from privies, barnyards, or
other places where animal decomposition is going on.[43] Avoiding the
use of cathartics in the onset of acute illness, the nature of which is
not known, is a useful prophylactic measure.A fatal diarrhoea may
result from injudicious purging in such cases.Care in the use of
laxatives should be observed in the chronic wasting
diseases--tuberculosis, rachitis, cancer, etc.[Footnote 42: The yearly occurrence of typhoid fever and diarrhoea at
seashore hotels shows that there is great danger in crowding persons
together and saturating the soil with the excreta.In the summer of
1882 in a boarding-house in the mountains of Maryland, where the
temperature was never above 75 degrees, there were three fatal cases of
diarrhoea in children, and several others of diarrhoea and dysentery
which recovered.][Footnote 43: The drinking-water supplying a country boarding-house
visited by the writer passed through iron pipes imbedded in the
manure-heap of a barnyard.]The selection of a plan of treatment for intestinal catarrh will depend
upon the nature and cause of the symptoms.The diagnosis of the case is
incomplete and the treatment irrational until the indications furnished
by etiology have been obtained.If cold has been the exciting cause, the patient should be confined to
bed.In the beginning a full dose of pilocarpin, hypodermically,[44] or
of the fluid extract of jaborandi by the mouth, may cause a powerful
diversion from the bowel to the skin.A hot-water or vapor bath has the
same object in view.Hot fomentations or mustard poultices can be next
applied to the abdomen.This should be succeeded by a febrifuge {689}
mixture containing the tincture of aconite-root, to which an opiate
(the deodorized tincture of opium or morphia) is to be added if there
is much pain or diarrhoea.A hypodermic injection of morphia given on
the first day of the attack immediately after a hot bath will give a
quiet night and diminish the intensity of the illness.The subsequent
treatment is that common to all the acute forms.[Footnote 44: Atropia can be given with pilocarpin to diminish its
effect on the heart; atropia is the antidote for pilocarpin.(See
Schuk, _Centralb.357; also,
Frohnmuller, _Med.-Chir.Centralb._, July 14, 1882.)]If summer heat has been the cause in adults or children, artificial
cooling of the temperature of the room by the evaporation of ice-water
or by one of the refrigerating machines yet to be perfected meet the
indication.If there is much body-heat (thermic fever), cold sponging,
the application of cold to the head, or the giving of pounded ice to
satisfy the intense thirst, are all advisable.Such cases are benefited
by a change of climate when the acute symptoms subside.The form of
diarrhoea due to malaria is to be treated by quinia and change of air
to a more healthful climate.Iron, with quinia or arsenic, is needed in
obstinate cases.Intestinal catarrh which proceeds from the presence of undigested food
or hard fecal lumps in the bowel is benefited by early removal of the
irritating cause.It is not often that substances of this kind are
retained when the stools are large and frequent.The peristalsis is
here as active as it need be, and no good, but only harm, can come from
over-stimulating the contractile muscles.In those instances where
there is a distinct history of the taking of indigestible food,
especially fruit with seeds or skins, and where the efforts at stool
are frequent, ineffectual, and accompanied by colic and borborygmi, or
where scybalae are found floating in the fluid passed, a large enema of
warm water given slowly will excite the bowel to successful expulsive
efforts.If this does not give a certain amount of prompt relief, a
moderate dose of castor oil, calomel, Rochelle or Epsom salts ought to
be prescribed, and repeated after some hours until a free fluid or
semi-fluid stool results; one or two doses will usually suffice.If the
inflammation is localized in the caecum (typhlitis), as indicated by
local pain, tenderness on pressure in the right iliac or right lumbar
regions, constipation, flexing of the right thigh on the trunk, and
vomiting, a purgative should not be given, nor should prolonged efforts
be made to empty the bowel by injection through long rectal tubes.If
there is doubt as to whether typhlitis or undigested food and fecal
impaction is the cause of the local pain, it is better to err on the
safe side, and not to give a purgative unless the case is seen in the
onset before the more pronounced symptoms appear; then calomel or
castor oil may be tried once, but not repeated in case of failure.As the diarrhoea of Bright's disease is salutary, no effort should be
made to arrest it.In
tuberculosis the special character of the diarrhoea must be considered,
and every effort must be made to control it.In the eruptive fevers an
early diarrhoea, as in scarlet fever, does harm; it delays or prevents
the normal development of the eruption.In the later stages it is of
service sometimes, as in measles, when it leads to a rapid fall of
temperature.The course of action depends upon the nature of the
specific disease and upon the time of the appearance of diarrhoea.There are certain principles, founded on the knowledge derived from
pathological study and from the experience of the past in the treatment
{690} of intestinal catarrh, which guide us to a treatment which is
more or less rational in all cases.Rest is essential to the cure of the inflamed intestine, but absolute
inertia of the bowel is undesirable, even injurious.The retention of
fluids, transuded serum, bile, intestinal juices, and partly-altered
food is hurtful.Decomposition sets in and gas is developed, which by
distending the bowel causes great suffering and increases the
inflammation.The movements of the intestine are not entirely under
control; the patient must be fed; digestion and assimilation involve
the activity of inflamed parts.The stomach can be made to do most of
the work, but the sympathy of action is so close between the stomach
and intestines that one cannot function without the other being excited
into activity.The first rule of treatment is to put the patient to bed and to keep
him in a horizontal position.Even in mild cases time will be saved by
resorting to absolute rest at once.If the attack is at all severe, the
bed-pan should be used; the effort to rise and the straining at stool
exaggerate peristaltic movement, increasing the frequency of the
evacuations.Additional rest can be given to the intestines by applying
a flannel binder around the trunk, compressing the abdomen; broad
strips of adhesive plaster could be used for the same purpose.In cases
where the diarrhoea, tympanites, and griping pain are not relieved by
other measures this suggestion may be of service.In order to lessen intestinal hyperaemia and allay suffering,
counter-irritants and soothing external applications are employed.Local blood-letting, although in vogue during more than two centuries,
has fallen into disuse.Recent authors still continue to advise the
application of leeches to the anus in order to deplete the portal
circulation,[45] but it is a decided objection to this remedy that the
fluid stools irritate the leech-bites and cause much discomfort.Sinapisms or turpentine stupes may be of some service apart from the
relief which they give to pain.Blisters might be more generally used
than they are when the tenderness on pressure is confined to the colon.Hot poultices of
flaxseed meal or hot fomentations of any sort applied over the entire
abdomen have a soothing and beneficial effect.A flannel compress
saturated with alcohol and covered with gutta-percha cloth makes a most
agreeable application.[Footnote 45: Niemeyer, _Practice of Medicine, Intestinal Catarrh_.]The directions for diet should be carefully and explicitly given.In
the onset of the attack entire deprivation of all food for twenty-four
or forty-eight hours is expedient.To relieve thirst, cracked ice,
carbonic-acid water, Apollinaris, Seltzer, or Deep Rock water can be
ordered; barley- or rice-water is slightly nourishing and relieves
thirst, but all liquids should be given in moderation.When it becomes
necessary to give food, the stomach must be made to do the work of
digestion, and, as far as possible, of absorption also.Such substances
are to be chosen as are converted in the stomach into peptones, and
which do not require contact with the intestinal juices for their
absorption.The peptones transformed in the stomach from nitrogenous alimentary
principles are highly soluble and diffusible.Milk is better suited to
the conditions of intestinal catarrh than any other nitrogenous food.It is palatable, relieves the thirst, and can be taken for a long time
without {691} aversion.By removing the cream, the fat, which would
require intestinal digestion, is partly got rid of.Skimmed milk does
not produce a feeling of distaste and what is called biliousness, as
does milk unskimmed.In cases where there is gastric catarrh the milk
can be made more digestible by adding an equal quantity of barley-water
or rice-water.The casein is then more slowly acted on by the gastric
juice and more thoroughly digested.Milk should be given in small
quantities at short intervals, as in this way the stomach performs the
entire work more thoroughly.If a large quantity is given, a portion of
it passes into the intestine unaltered.Buttermilk contains less fatty
matter than skimmed milk, and is a pleasant substitute for it.Koumiss,
if it could be properly prepared, would be an excellent food for
diarrhoea.Even the imperfect imitations are retained and digested when
other aliments fail.The whey of milk contains lactin, salts, a little
casein, and fatty matter.It may be made by adding to milk rennet,
sherry or other wine, cream of tartar, tamarind-juice, or alum.Milk-whey is slightly nourishing, and is said to be sudorific; when
prepared with wine it is a mild stimulant well suited to the cases of
children.Where it is desired to give as little work to the digestive organs as
is possible, milk and other foods can be given already partly digested,
as peptonized milk prepared according to the formulae of Roberts and
Fothergill.[46] Eggs are changed quickly in the stomach.Egg albumen is
more easily digested by artificial gastric juice than by pancreatic
extract (Roberts).A solution of egg albumen boiled in the water-bath
is swiftly and entirely transformed by pepsin and hydrochloric acid.Raw eggs have been thought to be the most digestible, but Roberts found
that a solution of egg albumen when raw was very slowly acted on by
pepsin and acid, but after being cooked it was rapidly and entirely
digested.Eggs are best given, therefore, boiled slightly at a slow
heat; when an egg is plunged in boiling water the white sets hard,
leaving the yelk soft.The albumen of the white and the yelk should be
equally cooked throughout.[Footnote 46: J. M. Fothergill, _Indigestion and Biliousness_, New
York, 1881, p.63 _et seq._ See also quote to article on CHRONIC
INTESTINAL CATARRH.]Beef-tea is said by the chemist to possess little nutritive value;
practical experience convinces the physician that it supports life.Peptonized beef-tea may be substituted when thought best.Animal broths
thickened with rice, barley, or with peptonized gruel, as advised by
Fothergill, or with the addition of vermicelli, are valuable aids when
the palate is capricious.Raw beef is not as digestible as when the
tendinous and aponeurotic structures of the muscular fibre have been
softened, disintegrated, and converted into the soluble and
easily-digested form of gelatin by cooking.[47] Scraped raw beef, when
the pulp is removed from much of the connective tissue, is easily
digested by children as well as by adults.In most cases of acute intestinal catarrh the patient can be well
sustained by a diet consisting of one or other of the aliments
described.For the largest number milk alone--that is, skimmed milk or
milk diluted with barley-water, rice-water, or Seltzer water--is all
that is necessary to support strength during the attack.Although
starch after deglutition is {692} acted on in the intestine only, it
becomes desirable sometimes to give farinaceous food in some form or
other; milk may be undigested and animal broths may become distasteful;
the palate craves some change.In this case a blanc mange made after
the formula of Meigs and Pepper is as well suited to adults as to
children,[48] the proportion of cream and arrowroot being made larger
for adults.Sago[49] and tapioca[50] can be tried to tempt the palate.The flour of the Egyptian lentil[51] is made into a gruel also.Most of
the patent foods for infants and invalids contain starch in some form
or other.Racahout is one of the pleasantest and best of these.Nestle's food contains baked biscuits of wheat flour ground to a
powder.Liebig's food is made of wheat flour, malt flour, and a little
bicarbonate of potassium.Revalenta Arabica is an attractive name for
the flour of Arabian lentil with barley flour.Any of these may be
advantageously employed in cases of some duration and in the later
stages of convalescence.[Footnote 48: Meigs and Pepper, _Diseases of Children_, Philada., 1870,
p.[Footnote 49: Put half an ounce of sago into an enamelled saucepan with
three-quarters of a pint of cold water, and boil gently for an hour and
a quarter.Skim when it comes to the boil, and stir frequently.Sweeten
with a dessertspoonful of sifted loaf sugar.If wine be ordered, two
dessertspoonfuls; and if brandy, one dessertspoonful.][Footnote 50: Half an ounce of the best tapioca to a pint and a quarter
of new milk.Simmer gently for two hours and a quarter, stirring
frequently; sweeten with a dessertspoonful of sifted sugar.][Footnote 51: Take three tablespoonfuls of lentil flour, a
salt-spoonful of salt, and one pint of water.Mix the flour and salt
into a paste with the water and boil ten minutes, stirring (_Food for
the Invalid_, Fothergill and Wood, New York, 1880).]The diet for convalescence should be controlled by the physician until
the patient has been well for at least two weeks.Liquid preparations
give place to fine hominy, corn meal or oatmeal porridge, with milk.Then bread or crackers may be given, the intervals between the meals
increasing to three or four hours.Raw oysters, sweetbreads, tender
rare steak or mutton finely divided and well masticated, rice, and ripe
peaches, succeed the simpler diet.Much saccharine, starchy, or fatty
food is to be avoided for at least two weeks after entire recovery.When the indications derived from the study of the cause have been
acted on, and the patient has been placed under a rigid discipline of
rest and diet, the treatment of symptoms comes next in order.In mild cases, where the cause has been irritating ingesta, diet may
relieve the symptoms in a short time without medicine.If diarrhoea
with slight colicky pains and flatulence continue after a few hours, a
mixture holding in suspension subnitrate of bismuth, with five drops of
the deodorized tincture of opium in each dose, or a pill of lead and
opium, will suffice in a short time to give relief.In severer attacks
the fever heat may mount to a high point, giving great distress to the
patient.If a temperature of 103 degrees to 104 degrees F. is
reached--which is not unusual in children--a warm bath is a sedative
and antipyretic remedy, or a bath of 95 degrees can be gradually cooled
down to 75 degrees or 65 degrees F.--a procedure which will bring down
the body-heat two or three degrees.A substitution for the bath is
sponging with cool or cold water, to which vinegar or bay rum may be
added; or towels wrung out of cold water can be applied to the trunk
and extremities (Ringer) with a very happy effect.Quinia can be used antipyretically in full doses, dissolved in dilute
hydrochloric acid.Pills, especially the sugar- or gelatin-coated
pills, {693} should not be given, as they irritate the mucous membrane
whether they are dissolved or not.In diarrhoea quinia pills often pass
unaltered.Flatulence, eructations of gas, and borborygmi are controlled by strict
diet according to the rules given.Bismuth subnitrate or subcarbonate
unites with sulphuretted hydrogen and absorbs it.The alkalies, sodium
and potassium bicarbonate, sodium hyposulphite, the aromatic spirits of
ammonia, either relieve acidity or prevent fermentation and the
development of gas.A satisfactory formula for the early stages of
intestinal catarrh is one containing bismuth subcarbonate, sodium
bicarbonate, aromatic spirits of ammonia in water or cinnamon-water.When the abdominal distension is great enough to be a cause of
distress, external cold--dry cold--is the best, applied with a rubber
bag filled with cracked ice or ice-water; it causes absorption of gas.Abdominal compression with a bandage may be of some service also.Mineral acids, especially the dilute hydrochloric acid, by affording
aid to the digestion prevent acid fermentation.Diarrhoea is the central symptom and the best standard by which to
measure the intensity of the catarrh and its progress.But it is only a
symptom, and the mind ought to be directed to the lesion and not to it.Having the cause in view, the object in all cases is to allay the
inflammation.This done, the diarrhoea decreases, then ceases.Shall
the effort be made to check the discharges, or shall they be allowed to
continue?The evacuant plan of treatment has been advocated, on the
ground that the purgative, by increasing intestinal secretion, relieves
the congestion of the intestinal blood-vessels and leaves the membrane
in a better state than before.[52] But inasmuch as a purgative only
acts by bringing about an intestinal hyperaemia and catarrh, there is
no good reason for, and many reasons against, treatment by evacuation.A preliminary purgative, as has already been stated, is necessary to
expel undigested food and scybalae, but for the purpose of increasing
intestinal or biliary secretion and diminishing engorgement of the
vessels this method is unsuccessful and unnecessary.When irritating
substances have been removed (and this is done usually without the
physician's aid by the spontaneous expulsive movements of the bowel)
the effort to check the discharge and to give rest is one and the same.Opium is the one invaluable remedy which we cannot do without.[53] As
little of it should be given as is necessary to relieve the intensity
of the symptoms.The aim should not be to stop the pain and check
diarrhoea, but to take the edge off the sharp agony and to lengthen the
interval between the stools.Thus gradually the spasms of peristalsis
cease, and there is a diminution, and finally cessation, of the fluid
accumulation in the bowel.The diarrhoea is relieved entirely in a
period ranging from an hour after the giving of the first dose to one
week, according to the severity of the attack.Opium is given in pill
form, in the deodorized tincture, Dover's powder, or one of the salts
of morphia may be preferred.Any of these may be combined with antacid
and antifermentative mixtures, relieving the colic, gaseous distension,
and diarrhoea.If opium is combined with, {694} or followed by,
evacuants, its effects are thwarted, and it might as well not be given
at all.[Footnote 53: The objections urged against opium, that it increases
thirst and nervousness, causes a retention of fermenting products,
produces opium intoxication, and that it is a routine practice to give
it, and does not cure the inflammation, may be valid, but we cannot do
without opium, nevertheless.]It is the custom to combine astringents with opium, but in acute cases
of short duration it is a question whether astringents do not do more
harm than good.When good does come from the combination, it is the
opium which acts promptly and decidedly.The astringent lags behind,
and in cases of some duration and severity supplements the work of the
active partner.Bismuth is classed under this head, although it is not
an astringent.Its action is mechanical; much that is taken is passed
from the bowel as the black sulphide, which appears as a black granular
powder in the fluid stool.This is no proof that it may not have been
of service in its transit.[54] After death, when large doses have been
given, it has been found lining the whole intestinal canal.[55] The
subnitrate or subcarbonate can be given in powder on an empty stomach
in doses of five to twenty grains alone or in combination with opium,
or it can be dispensed with alkalies in water.The enormous doses (one
hundred and fifty to nine hundred grains daily), as given by Monneret,
are useless or hurtful.The value of bismuth is based on empirical
grounds only, but it is irrational to load the bowel with an insoluble
powder which if retained must cause irritation.As the discoloration of
the stools is an objection to bismuth when it is desired to study their
character for diagnosis, oxide of zinc may be substituted for it, as
the latter is an absorbent of acids and gases.[56] Gubler has insisted
upon combining it with bicarbonate of sodium to prevent the formation
of the irritating chloride of zinc in the stomach.[57] One of the
oldest and most popular remedies tor diarrhoea is lime in the form of
the carbonate or lime-water.The officinal mistura cretae is perhaps
more generally used for children than any other remedy.Lime-water is
added with advantage to milk when given to adults as well as children.Carrara-water, made by dissolving the bicarbonate of lime with an
excess of carbonic acid, is less nauseous than liquor calcis, and may
be mixed with an equal part of milk.[58] Chalk and its preparations are
less beneficial than bismuth as astringents, but may be used merely for
their antacid effect.[Footnote 54: Headland asserted that bismuth was insoluble, but it has
been detected in the liver, in milk, in urine, and in the serum of
dropsy by Orfila, Sewald, Bergeret, and Mayencon (_Materia Med._,
Phillips, vol.[Footnote 55: Levick, _Am.Sci._, July, 1858, p.[Footnote 56: Bonamy, "Du Traitement des Diarrhees rebelles par l'Oxyde
de Zinc," _Bull.251; also, J.
Jacquier, _De l'Emploi de l'Oxyde de Zinc dans la Diarrhee_, Paris,
Thesis, 1878, No.[Footnote 57: Gubler, _Principles of Therapeutics_, Philada., 1881, p.[Footnote 58: Phillips, _Materia Medica_, vol.The sugar of lead is a valuable astringent, because unirritating and
sedative to the mucous membrane.With opium in pill form, in doses of
one to three grains, it checks diarrhoea if the inflammation has not
lasted long and is not extensive.If there are cases where the bile is
passed in quantity, it is especially called for, as it is the only
astringent which diminishes the flow of bile.The mineral acids--dilute hydrochloric, nitric, and sulphuric
acids--are given with some success.The first aids gastric digestion,
and in small doses with pepsin can be directed after food irrespective
of other treatment.The great repute which it has enjoyed in the
diarrhoea of typhoid is no doubt due to the improved digestion and
assimilation {695} which follow its use.The acid principle is what is
lacking in the gastric juice in fever and debility.[59] In all cases of
intestinal catarrh rapidity of gastric digestion should be sought for.Without an opiate in combination
there is little reason to hope for any result from its use; all the
suggested formulae contain opiates.[60] Dilute sulphuric acid is
thought to be more astringent than the others.If it has any efficacy,
it is due to the local astringent or alterative effect by contact with
the inflamed surface.Much testimony is to be found in its support in
cases tending to become chronic and where astringents combined with
opiates have failed after some days' trial.It should be administered
in doses of five to twenty drops in the form of mixture with mucilage
or some aromatic, as lavender and cardamom.An opiate should not be
combined with it if it is desired to test it fairly.It would be called
for when the stools are pale, abundant, watery, and alkaline.[Footnote 59: Manassein, _Virchow's Archiv_, lv., 1872, p.[Footnote 60: The favor in which nitric acid is held is due to the
advocacy of nitrous acid by Hope ("Observations on the Powerful Effects
of a Mixture containing Nitrous Acid and Opium in curing Dysentery,
Cholera, and Diarrhoea," _Edin.Nitrous acid, the same as the fuming nitric acid of the
shops, is a reddish-yellow fluid highly charged with nitrogen trioxide.Hope said that ordinary nitric acid did not produce the same effects,
and yet nitric acid is now given with the belief that it is of
service.]Calomel is of ancient repute as a remedy in the early stages of
diarrhoea.According to recent views, it acts as a sedative to the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane and checks fermentation.It should be
given in small doses (one-twelfth to one-eighth of a grain to children,
one-fourth to one-half of a grain to adults); it should not be
continued for more than two or three days.In combination with Dover's
powder it acts well, but it is doubtful which of the two remedies
should receive the greater praise for the resulting improvement.A very
small dose of the bichloride of mercury has been found beneficial by
Ringer for clayey, pasty stools or straining stools containing slime
and blood.j; Aquae fluidounce
x; a teaspoonful frequently during the day.The gray powder is not as
much thought of now as formerly; it is not so good for the early stages
of diarrhoea as calomel, but may be tried as an alterative when the
stools are green and offensive.In the vegetable materia medica there are many and ancient remedies.Tannin represents a large class, and there is nothing more than fancy
in preferring to it kino, catechu, haematoxylon, or blackberry-root.Tannin is precipitated in the stomach as an inert tannate; gallic acid
is to be preferred for this reason, and also for its pleasant taste and
less irritating effect on the mucous membrane.It is well borne by
children, even in large doses, when given with water and syrup.It is
to be hoped that the unsightly and unsavory combinations of the
astringent tinctures with chalk mixture will be soon given up.They are
given chiefly to children, who are repelled by the sight, and still
more by the taste, of such compounds.The syrup of krameria is the
least objectionable, and catechu and krameria are made into troches
which are sometimes available.Ipecacuanha is said by Bartholow to be extremely serviceable in the
diarrhoea of teething children with greenish stools containing mucus or
blood.He prescribes it with bismuth and pepsin.{696} Recently some favor has been paid to coto-bark and its active
principle, cotoin.The latter is advised to be given in the following
formula:

  Rx.Cotoinae,        gr.j;
      Aquae distillat.fluidounce iv;
      Alcohol,         gtt.x;
      Syrupi,          fluidounce j.

A tablespoonful every hour.Five to eight drops of the fluid extract of
coto are given.It is said to have a speedy and certain effect in acute
diarrhoea.[61]

[Footnote 61: Coto-bark was imported into Europe from Bolivia in 1873,
and was called quinquina coto.Wittstein of Munich and Julius Jobst of
Stuttgart made the first analyses (_Neues Repertorium fur Pharmacie_,
xxiv.Von Gietl (_idem_, xxv.)first concluded from
experiments that it was of use in diarrhoea.Cotoin and paracotoin were
separated by Jobst.It has been found successful in the treatment of
diarrhoea in Germany and of cholera in Japan (Baelz, _Centralb.Wissen._, 1878, xvi.Cotoin sometimes disturbs the
digestion to a marked degree.Paracotoin may be used hypodermically.]Salicin,[62] ergot, guarana, have all been spoken of by enthusiasts as
possessing valuable properties in diarrhoea.[Footnote 62: Lawson, "Diarrhoea and its Treatment at the London
Hospitals," _Med.122; Bishop,
"Salicin in Diarrhoea and Dysentery," _Southern Med.585; "Comparative Value of Opium and Salicin in Diarrhoea and
Dysentery," _Detroit Review of Med.Sulphate of copper is fitted for cases in
danger of passing into the chronic stage.Sulphate of zinc might be
more generally ordered than is the case.The sulphate of iron and the
fluid preparations of iron--tincture of the chloride, solution of the
pernitrite, and persulphate--are astringents, and could be tried if
other remedies fail.The effect of nitrate of silver is to constrict
vessels, to coagulate and disinfect excretions, and to form an adherent
protecting membrane (Phillips).It occupies the next place to lead, and
is suited to a subacute stage when acute symptoms have subsided.It is
warmly recommended by William Pepper and others.[63] The oxide of
silver has been preferred by some writers.[64] For the protracted
diarrhoea of children, in whom follicular ulcers form so rapidly, the
nitrate of silver is of special value.To adults it is administered in
a pill freshly made in doses of one-eighth to one grain.A solution in
distilled water with syrup answers well for children, the dose varying
from one-twentieth to one-fourth of a grain.[Footnote 63: J. Maggregor, "On the Internal Use of Nitrate of Silver
in Inflammation of the Intestines," _Lancet_, 1841, vol.[Footnote 64: Lane, _Med.-Chir.289 _et seq._;
Eyre, _The Stomach and its Difficulties_, London, 1852.]The theory of the germ origin of diarrhoea has naturally brought into
notice antiseptic remedies.Carbolic acid,[65] creasote,[66]
naphtha,[67] sulpho-carbolate of calcium,[68] salicylic acid,[69] and
chlorine-water have each been advocated.Practice does not support
their claim to be considered remedies for intestinal inflammation.[Footnote 65: Habershon, _Lancet_, London, 1868, vol.7; C. G.
Rothe, _Berliner klin.Wochenschrift_, 1871, p.583;
_ibid._, vol.des Hopitaux_, 1849, p.[Footnote 69: W. Wagner, _Kolbe's Journ.{697} Treatment by the rectum may be employed when medicines are
rejected by the stomach or when it is desired to bring the drugs into
more direct contact with the inflamed colon.Opiates, astringents, and
alteratives are employed in this way.Laudanum in two to four ounces of
warm water or in warm milk or starch-water can be thrown into the
rectum, the fluid being allowed to remain.The injections are to be
given often enough to relieve pain and lessen the number of discharges.With the laudanum, or without it, the mineral astringents can be used
by enema.Acetate of lead or sulphate of zinc is to be preferred.The
objection that but a small portion of the inflamed surface is reached
by the fluid is a valid one, and therefore those cases are most
benefited where the catarrh is in the lower colon and rectum.Ringer[70] says that it is not at all necessary for the fluid to reach
that part of the intestine which is the seat of the catarrh; the
impression made on one part is communicated to the other by sympathy.It was the practice with O'Beirne,[71] Hare,[72] and others to inject
fluid by a long flexible tube passed beyond the sigmoid flexure.This
method is advocated and employed in Europe by Mosler, Winterinz, and
Monti.Quite recently Dulles has drawn attention to irrigation of the
large intestine as a means of treating inflammation of the colon,
according to the plan of Alois Monti of Vienna.[73] Henoch has tried
with partial success in children the throwing into the rectum of a
large quantity of water holding in solution acetate of lead, alum, or
tannin.His method contemplates medication above the sigmoid flexure; a
part of the fluid escapes, while the rest remains five or ten minutes
in the bowel.[74] Monti says as much as two pints can be injected into
the bowel of a nursing child--for older children twice this quantity.[Footnote 70: _Therapeutics_, New York, 1882, p.[Footnote 71: _New Views of the Process of Defecation_, Washington,

CHRONIC INTESTINAL CATARRH.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.ETIOLOGY.--Chronic intestinal catarrh has many of the same causes as
the acute form; it is the expression of a large number of different
pathological states and complicates many general and local diseases.It is very common in children under two years of age, and is associated
with change in diet in weaning and with the irritability of all the
tissues during dentition.It is also a frequent disease in old persons,
being due to imperfect mastication, the weakness of digestion, portal
congestion, the gouty diathesis, and other causes.[1] Men have the
disease more frequently than women.Hereditary influence and
idiosyncrasy predispose to chronic catarrh of the bowel as to catarrh
of the bronchi.Bad hygiene, want of cleanliness with an unhealthy
condition of the skin, constant breathing of foul air due to want of
proper ventilation, animal decomposition, or overcrowding predisposes
to chronic diarrhoea.The chronic diarrhoeas among soldiers in
camps,[2] among the inmates of prisons, workhouses, and asylums, are
examples of these influences.Overwork, especially mental overwork with
anxiety, and privation of sleep act in the same direction.In the
chronic constitutional diseases and in many chronic diseases of organs
diarrhoea sooner or later appears, and very generally is the immediate
cause of death.In phthisis pulmonum, whether tubercular or not, simple
catarrh of the bowel is nearly always present.[Footnote 1: _La Diarrhee chez les Viellards_, Paris, Thesis, 1865, No.See also works of Durand-Fardel and Charcot and Loomis.][Footnote 2: According to the statistics prepared in 1871 by T. B. Hood
of the U.S.Pension Office, chronic diarrhoea was the disease for which
a pension was granted in 20 per cent.of all cases of disability from
disease and in 75 per cent.of all the diseases of the digestive system
(_Report of Commissioner of Pensions_, 1871).]During the course of chronic Bright's disease, more frequently in the
cirrhotic form, lesions are developed in the intestine which cause
obstinate diarrhoea.The discharge of urea into the intestine, and its
conversion into carbonate of ammonium, which acts as an irritant to the
mucous membrane, is the reason of the diarrhoea in this disease,
according to Luton and Treitz;[3] and in so far as the discharge
represents the escape of urea by the bowel, it may be regarded as
salutary.In gout, especially in old persons, periodical diarrhoea
gives relief.Chronic gouty subjects assert that they are not benefited
by colchicum until it has purged them.The {700} lithic-acid diathesis,
pyaemia, septicaemia, scurvy,[4] diabetes, leucocythaemia, Addison's
disease, and syphilis[5] have diarrhoea during some part of their
progress.The malarial cachexia is often attended with a diarrhoea
which quinia alone will relieve; this symptom may occur periodically or
be constant.[Footnote 3: A. Luton, _Des Series morbides, Affections uremiques de
l'Intestin_, Paris, Thesis, 1859, No.45; also, Treitz, "Ueber
uramische Darmaffectionen," _Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, Bd.[Footnote 4: See testimony as to the influence of scurvy in promoting
diarrhoea (Woodward, _Med.History of the War_, Part 2,
Medical Volume, p.[Footnote 5: A. Trousseau, "Comments on a Case of Syphilitic Diarrhoea
cured by Mercury," _Clinique med._, Paris, 1868, t. iii.Disease of the liver, heart, or lungs, by retarding the circulation in
the portal system, causes venous stasis and catarrh in the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane.The chief conditions which bring
this about are tumors compressing the mesenteric veins, cirrhosis of
the liver, tumors pressing on the ascending vena cava, valvular disease
of the right and left heart, fatty degeneration or dilatation of the
heart, cardiac debility from chronic exhausting diseases, fibroid
phthisis, chronic pneumonic phthisis, chronic pleurisy, and pulmonary
emphysema.An unsuitable diet may not set up an acute catarrh, but may slowly
induce changes of a chronic nature in the mucous membrane.This is the
case in infants fed upon artificial food instead of breast-milk, or
when the digestion is overtaxed after weaning.In adults food difficult
of digestion and over-eating bring about the same result.Alcohol,
spices, and condiments, if taken in excess, and the habitual use of
purgatives, lead to chronic inflammation of the intestine.Foreign bodies, such as fecal concretions, gall-stones, stones of
fruit, bones, coins, and pins, by remaining in contact with the mucous
membrane for a length of time, determine inflammation and
ulceration.[6]

[Footnote 6: Lothrop, "Case of a Child in whom seventeen plum-stones,
three cherry-stones, and seven small bones were impacted In the caecum
and ileum for a year.Inflammation, ulceration, and perforation of the
bowel resulted" (_Buffalo Med.Journ._, March, 1882, p.Neglect in the treatment of acute catarrh, the prolongation of an acute
attack, from its intensity and the incurability of the lesions,
establish chronic disease.All chronic lesions of the bowel are complicated with chronic catarrh,
as chronic tubercular ulcer, neoplasms in the wall, pressure of a tumor
from without, etc.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The alterations in the intestines in chronic
catarrh involve the walls to a much greater extent than in the acute
form.The intestinal tube is dilated, contracted, or irregularly dilated and
contracted.When the calibre is increased the walls are thinned.Hypertrophy and hardening of the tunics, chiefly of the muscular and
submucous tissue, are accompanied by a narrowing of the canal, and this
change, most common in the rectum and sigmoid flexure, sometimes
involves a very considerable extent of the colon.Lebert records the
case of a woman who had diarrhoea for six weeks; constipation and
vomiting with abdominal tenderness ensued.There was hypertrophy of all
the coats of the stomach and of the ascending colon and rectum.The
rectum was so narrowed by the thickening of its wall that a female
catheter could not be passed through it.[7] In chronic catarrh the
mucous membrane {701} of the colon and of the lower part of the ileum
is the seat of the most characteristic lesions.The colon was alone the
seat of disease in 9 out of 99 cases analyzed by Woodward; in the
remaining 90 the two were involved together.In these the lesions in
the colon (especially in the rectum and sigmoid flexure) were always
more advanced and more serious than in the small intestine.[Footnote 7: Lebert, _Path.247, 248; another case,
Laboulbene, _Anat.path._, Paris, 1879, p.Gastric catarrh may by extension become duodenal catarrh, and from the
duodenum the disease may extend into the common bile-duct and its
branches.The duodenitis and catarrh of the ducts may persist, and
become chronic after the stomach lesion is gone.The mucous lining of the intestine is changed in color, form,
thickness, consistence, and in the appearance of its glandular
structures.The shades of color in chronic inflammation are dark red,
livid, brown, drab, or slate-color, light blue, and greenish.Dark-red and gray spots are seen on a pale
and uniform red ground; grayish streaks and patches are mingled with
red or whitish areas, giving rise to a mottled or marbled
appearance.[8] In some cases red predominates, in others the
slate-color.[9] Dark-brown, almost black, patches are also seen.These
different tints depend upon the intensity and character of the
inflammation and the stage which it has reached.Diffused bright-red
discolorations belong to acute inflammation, and are rarely seen in the
chronic form.Acute hyperaemic patches appearing in the midst of a
slate- membrane indicate intercurrent acute attacks.Dark-red
streaks or spots are caused by extravasations.Brown and slate-
areas represent the changes in old extravasations or pigment-deposits
where inflammation or ulceration has existed.Where the inflammation is
progressing toward the destruction of tissue the membrane is
dark-purplish or black in color, mottled with patches of dull reddish
hue and minute spots of bright red.Black dots are seen in the small
and large intestine isolated or in close proximity.They are due to
minute specks of black pigment deposited in the apices of the villi, in
the centres of solitary glands, in rings around them, or in the glands
of a Peyer's patch.The juxtaposition of pinhead black points gives
rise to the shaven-beard appearance[10] of the mucous membrane.Dark
streaks or wavy lines of pigment are also seen.[11]

inflammation see the following illustrations in color: _Med.of the War_, Part 2, Medical Volume--plates facing pp.308, 518,

volume cited, facing p.In the ileum the mucous folds are obliterated or swollen and thickened.Obliteration of the folds occurs in connection with a dilated
intestine; when the intestine is contracted they are elevated,
tortuous, and close together.The villi are hypertrophied, looking
often like minute polypi.The mucous coat is usually thickened,
measuring from one-fifth to one-fourth of an inch.It is softened, and
more easily scraped off,[12] but quite {702} frequently there is
induration instead of softening.The solitary glands of the ileum are
hypertrophied and appear scattered over the mucous surface as small
rounded elevations.They are quite numerous or a few only may be seen.A ring of vascular injection usually surrounds each enlarged follicle.Peyer's patches may be unchanged or from swelling of the follicles are
more prominent than is normal, but relatively the enlargement of the
solitary glands is greater.In chronic catarrh the follicles acquire
greater size than in the acute form.The apices of the solitary glands
in the small intestine may be broken down, leaving small follicular
ulcers, with swollen rings around them formed of the undestroyed and
hypertrophied gland-structure.Here and there one or two of the
follicles in the Peyer's patch may have its centre indented by
ulceration.These changes are usually in the lower part of the ileum
near the caecum.[Footnote 12: The mucous membrane is often tumefied and softened in
cases where there are thickening and contraction of the intestine with
great reduction of its calibre (Elliot Coues, _Med.Rep._,
Philada., 1863, vol.In the colon the enlarged solitary glands are in greater number, and
are dotted about more closely in the descending colon and sigmoid
flexure.[13] When there is ulceration the large intestine has many more
ulcers than the ileum, and they are more numerous in the lower part of
the colon.They appear as sharply-punched openings, and give to the
mucous surface a honeycombed look; their diameter varies from one-tenth
to one-fourth of an inch.Large ulcers formed by the confluence of
smaller ones measure from one-fourth to one inch in diameter; they may
be so deep as to have the muscular tunic for their base, and quite
often the bottom of the ulcers is black.A ragged or uneven appearance
is given to the surface by the ulcers being close together.Such
extensive destruction sometimes takes place that no normal mucous
membrane seems to be left.Perforating ulcers are occasionally seen in
the large intestine or ileum.Perforation occurred in two of Woodward's
ninety-nine cases.Healing ulcers[14] are found by the side of others
which are growing.Healed follicular ulcers are known by a puckered,
stellated appearance[15] of the mucous membrane, which is pigmented and
of a slate-gray or marbled-brown color[16] if the process has been long
completed.Larger dense cicatrices, pigmented also, mark the site of
more extensive ulcerations.[Footnote 13: Illustration, _Kupfertafeln zu_ DR.LESSER _uber die
Entzundung und Verschwarung du Schleimhaut des Verdauungskanales_,

figs.[Footnote 15: Illustration, _Med.[Footnote 16: Illustration, Cruveilhier, _Anat.; also, J. Hope, _Illustrations of Morbid Anatomy_, figs.Besides follicular ulcers the mucous membrane is disorganized by ulcers
which have their origin in a loss of epithelium and superficial
erosion.In addition to the lesions already described, the inflamed and
ulcerated surface is sometimes covered with a pseudo-membranous layer
of greenish-yellow color.Chronic catarrh of the duodenum is the cause of dilatation of the
vessels and thickening of the coats.A varicose condition of the veins
may give rise to hemorrhage without ulceration.[17] The orifice of the
common bile-duct and the ducts for some distance are narrowed by
swelling of their lining membrane.[18] Ulcer of the upper part of the
duodenum {703} is found rarely in connection with external burns and
chronic Bright's disease.It is more common in men between thirty and
forty years of age.An embolized artery is the starting-point of the
lesion.The mucous layer, deprived of its nutrition in a limited area,
dies or is destroyed by the acid gastric juice; a round ulcer with
terraced edges is left, its base being the muscular or serous coat.Adhesions may form between the peritoneum near the ulcer and the liver,
gall-bladder, or pancreas, or an opening may take place posteriorly in
the right seventh intercostal space or into the peritoneal cavity.Cicatrization of the ulcer may lead to narrowing of the canal of the
bowel or of the pancreatic and common bile-ducts.[19]

[Footnote 17: G. Coulon, _Bull.[Footnote 18: Duodenitis was made much of by Broussais and his
followers, and a great deal has been written about it.(See Boudin,
Paris, Thesis, 1837, No.76, _Essai sur la Duodenite chronique_.)][Footnote 19: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, Amer.Suppuration in the wall of the duodenum is still rarer.One case only
is on record of pus being found in the intestinal wall.[20]

[Footnote 20: Picard, _Bull.xv., 1840-41,
p.See also microscopic view of suppuration in wall of duodenum,
Thierfelder, _Atlas d. path.Histologie_, 2 lief., Tab.Chronic proctitis or inflammation of the rectum may exist by itself.The mucous membrane is swollen, hyperaemic, and the walls may be
indurated and thickened so as to reduce the calibre of the tube.Superficial erosions or deep ulcers and perforation are due to the
retention of hard fecal matter in the distended pouches of the rectum.Inflammation in the tissue around the rectum (periproctitis) is excited
by inflammation of the wall without perforation; abscesses form and
burst externally or into the bowel, thus establishing fistulae.PATHOLOGICAL HISTOLOGY.--The essential primary feature of chronic
catarrh is the increase and persistence of cell-accumulation in the
reticular connective tissue of the mucous and submucous layer.After an
acute or subacute attack some time elapses before the large number of
cell-elements are disintegrated or absorbed.By remaining they offer a
constant invitation to causes of irritation, hence the necessity for
prolonged care in diet after acute attacks.Fresh causes--imprudence in
eating, etc.--induce additions to the number of cells, and the tissue
becomes overcharged with active elements of growth.Hypertrophy of
tissues results, the mucous and submucous tissues thicken, and the
glandular structures are stimulated to a condition of morbid activity.The glands of Lieberkuhn elongate, the number of acini increases, and
the contained cells multiply.Accidental closure of the gland-openings
from outside pressure or over-accumulation of the contents leads to
cyst-formations.The lymph-cells in the reticular tissue of the closed
follicles undergo rapid increase; the follicle is over-distended,
projects above the surface, bursts, and a small ulcerating cavity is
left.This is now enlarged by the breaking down of the remaining tissue
of the follicle, then of the submucosa.The overhanging roof of mucous
membrane, deprived of its nutrition, sloughs off at the edges and the
exposed ulcerated surface is increased.By the confluence of two or
more burrowing ulcers more extensive destruction of the mucous and
submucous layers is brought about.The large deepened ulcers have the
mucous layer for their base.Cicatrization of the ulcers takes place by
the formation of cicatricial tissue at their base; the excavation is
filled up partially, by contraction the edges are brought together, and
the tissue solidifies.No villi or epithelium covers these cicatrices.{704} There are rarer pathological changes.In catarrh of long duration
cysts are found, especially in the large intestine.They are about the
size of a small pea, projecting above the mucous surface.They have a
yellow or amber color, and contain a jelly-like yellow fluid which can
be pressed out.They originate in the distension of the dilating glands
of Lieberkuhn; according to Woodward, they find a favorable nidus for
their growth in the softening tissue of the solitary glands; hence the
cystic forms are seen occupying the interior of follicles undergoing
disintegration.[21] The presence of the glands of Lieberkuhn in the
interior of the closed follicles has been observed by other
pathologists, some of whom are unable to explain so remarkable a
lesion.[22] Around the edges or in the midst of healing ulcers in the
intestine granulation-like excrescences or polypoid growths are
observed as a rare lesion.These seem to be projections from
undestroyed islands of mucous membrane, being surrounded by the
ulcerated surface.The minute polypi originate in a process of growth
of the undestroyed mucous tissue.Cicatricial contractions around their
bases give them peculiar forms; they are club-shaped, simple, or
branched.This lesion has been described by Johann Wagner,[23] Carl
Rokitansky,[24] and J. J. Woodward[25] from original specimens.According to Woodward, the growths (pseudo-polypi he calls them) are
composed of a central portion of connective tissue continuous with the
submucous connective tissue of the intestine and a peripheral portion
of diseased mucous membrane.The central connective tissue was filled
with large and numerous cells, and the glands of Lieberkuhn in the
mucous covering were elongated and branched and showed evidences of an
active hyperplasia.[Footnote 21: J. J. Woodward, _op.[Footnote 22: A. Laboulbene, _Anat.path._, Paris, 1879, p.[Footnote 23: "Einige Formen von Darmgeschwuren; iii., die

Jan., 1881, p.Polypi of the colon have been seen and figured by other pathologists,
but they were not connected with ulceration and cicatrization of
ulcers.Luschka[26] saw the mucous membrane from the ileo-caecal valve
to the end of the rectum covered with polypi, club-shaped, the size of
a hempseed or bean, and made up of glandular tubes simple or branched.Other cases have been described by Lebert, Heuriet, and others,[27] in
which polypi were distributed in the rectum, colon, caecum, or about
the ileo-caecal valve.This is the condition described by Virchow as
colitis polyposa.[Footnote 26: _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.[Footnote 27: Heuriet, _Bull.xlviii.,

being normal or in a state of chronic catarrh.of the cases examined either in the large or small intestine.The
caecum is the most frequent seat; next in the order of frequency it is
seen in the ascending {705} colon, the lower part of the ileum, the
other parts of the colon, and is least common in the upper part of the
ileum.In children the lesion is more common in the small intestine
than in adults.The changes in the mucous membrane of the colon are a
diminution in its thickness and disappearance of the glands of
Lieberkuhn.The mucous layer is reduced to one-fifth of its normal
size, and no trace of the glands may be left; a layer of connective
tissue with imbedded round cells is all that remains.The surface of
the membrane is irregular and  with yellowish pigment.In the
ileum the villi are shrunken, with few cells; in some cases they
disappear altogether.The muscular tunic may share in the atrophy.[28]

membrane is met with in chronic catarrh.The small arteries of the
villi and submucous layer, the muscular and other tissues, are
infiltrated with a new material allied to fibrin.The membrane to the
eye is paler than normal.When iodine is applied, a characteristic red
staining of the infiltrated parts is noticed.This lesion is a cause of
diarrhoea and of hemorrhage,[29] from the greater permeability and
greater fragility of the arteries.It is also associated with
follicular ulceration, and is probably a cause of disintegration of the
mucous membrane.[30]

catarrh, few of which have any distinctive character.The peritoneum
shows signs of old or recent inflammation.The former is subacute or
chronic, and is recognized by the adhesions of opposed surfaces in a
limited area, frequently corresponding to the seat of intense
intestinal inflammation.Fatal perforations are delayed or prevented by
these adhesions.General peritonitis with soft lymph or sero-purulent
effusion is found with perforation.The mesenteric glands may be
enlarged.The liver is larger or sometimes smaller than normal, and its
tissue is softened and may be fatty.Abscess of the liver[31] is a very
rare result of chronic intestinal catarrh, with ulceration.The
gall-bladder is usually filled with bile.The spleen is small and firm
in texture; less commonly it is soft and friable.The kidneys are large and pale; the cortical substance is
relatively increased and the tubules contain granular epithelium.[Footnote 31: It occurred in 4 per cent.of Woodward's cases of chronic
follicular ulceration.See case reported by the writer in which the
ulcers healed before the death of the patient from hepatic abscess
(_Maryland Med.Journ._, March 15, 1883, p.In the thorax the heart is flabby, pale, and small; clots are found in
the right and left side extending into the pulmonary artery and aorta.Sudden death has been attributed to cardiac thrombosis.That coagula
{706} do form in the heart during life is shown by the sudden
occurrence of cerebral embolism with aphasia.[32]

[Footnote 32: The writer has seen one case of this kind occurring
during the effort at stool in a patient who was very feeble and very
anaemic from chronic intestinal inflammation with ulceration.]Pneumonia is the most frequent pulmonary lesion; it may be single or
double.It was found in 18 of the 99 cases of Woodward, and in 21 out
of H. A. Allen's 41 cases.Inflammation of the pleura is not
infrequent.The brain and its membranes may be congested, and fluid is
found in the subarachnoid space, in some instances in cases which have
had a sudden termination.The cornea is ulcerated, and the eye
destroyed by opening of the anterior chamber in a small proportion of
cases.The sloughing process begins in the lower part of the cornea and
in the sclerotic.SYMPTOMS.--When chronic intestinal catarrh succeeds the acute form, the
transition is marked by the disappearance of fever and an amelioration
of all the symptoms, with apparent recovery.The patient begins to go
about, but diarrhoea returns whenever there is any unusual fatigue or
excess in eating.In some cases there is no improvement in the
diarrhoea, but in the general symptoms only.When the malady is chronic
from the beginning, the onset is characterized by symptoms of
indigestion and occasional diarrhoea, which become more and more
pronounced according to the severity of the illness.Mild forms of catarrh have constipation, or diarrhoea alternates with a
normal or constipated state of the bowels.The form in which
constipation is continuous is associated with mechanical stasis from
liver and heart lesions and with the gouty and uric-acid diathesis.The
mucous membrane is in a state of passive hyperaemia, an excess of mucus
being the product of the inflammatory process.Mucus coats the lining
tunic, lessens its irritability, interferes with digestion and
absorption, and acts as a ferment, exciting decomposition in the food.The bowel is atonic and is distended with contained gas; there is great
feebleness of peristaltic contractions.Intestinal indigestion and constipation are therefore the symptoms of
this form.The signs of indigestion occur one to three hours after
eating, according to the location of the maximum of catarrh and the
time taken by the food to reach this point.They are a sense of fulness
or distress in the abdomen from gaseous distension, slight colicky
pains, and a rumbling of gas, which may be prolonged during several
hours after a meal.The constipation is indicated by the spontaneous
passage of dry masses or scybalae coated with layers of mucus which are
clear or cloudy, or the mucus may be intimately mixed with solid
matter.Pure mucus is also expelled without fecal matter.There may be
no stool without a purgative, and then softened matter with scybalae
and mucus is passed.Altered mucus in the form of membraniform shreds
or cylinders occasionally pass in the so-called membranous enteritis.The abdomen is full and not sensitive to pressure.The tongue is coated
and usually pale and flabby.In appearance the patient exhibits a
general want of tone; the skin is white or muddy, the muscles are soft,
and the expression indicates the depression of spirits, the lassitude,
and the inertia which he feels.Hemorrhoids are very likely to {707}
exist.Such a condition may last for months or years without much
change.Under proper treatment recovery may take place, but if entirely
neglected or improperly treated the disease inevitably becomes worse.In a second mild form there is no permanent disease, only an
impressionability of the mucous membrane of the bowel to causes which
induce hyperaemia and excessive secretion ending in diarrhoea.Exposure
to cold, fatigue, or slight indiscretions in diet may bring it on; even
an emotional cause may do it.The attacks last one or several days, and
may at times assume some gravity.This predisposition to diarrhoea
lasting through a lifetime is analogous to the tendency to inflammation
of the nasal and other mucous membranes.In severer and typical forms the symptoms point to permanent lesions.The tongue is smooth, shining, or glazed, sometimes with a central
brown streak, but it may be also pale and covered with a white coat.The appetite is diminished or lost, or it is capricious, craving
unsuitable food.If there is no gastric catarrh, the chief distress
does not come until some hours after eating, but the taking of food
sometimes excites pain and brings on an evacuation of the bowels
through reflex influence.There may be slight tympanites or a retracted abdomen.The imperfect
digestion of food and the fermentation of the intestinal contents
develop gas which keeps the abdomen distended and causes slight pains
and borborygmi.A feeling of
abdominal soreness is not unusual; it is increased by coughing,
sneezing, or any sudden movement.Sensibility to pressure is usually
wanting; when it exists it is found along the line of the colon in most
cases.The number of the stools
varies from one to eight in twenty-four hours; four is about the
average number.They occur usually in the early morning hours, from two
to six o'clock, but food may at any time bring on peristaltic
contraction, so that a motion after every meal is not uncommon.In
quantity there is much variability; two to four ounces of fluid matter
is the rule perhaps, but a very much larger amount than this is often
passed with each evacuation.As a rule, the larger the quantity of
fluid the more extensive is the catarrh and the more advanced are the
lesions.The matters passed are composed chiefly of fecal matter
varying in consistence from a solid or semi-solid mass to a watery
fluid.In the soft stool, like thickened gruel, the consistence is due
to the presence of mucus; in the thinner evacuation water is the chief
element.In color the dejecta are
brown, yellow, red, green, slate-color, or white.They may be 
dark by medicines, as iron or bismuth, or by blood.The presence of
blood gives a pinkish, bright-red, dark-brown, or black color,
depending upon the amount of blood and the changes it has undergone in
the bowel from a longer or shorter retention.Blood, when it comes from
the rectum, is in bright-red streaks or small coagula.When its source
is higher up, it is much altered, being dark and granular.Coffee-ground sediment in a fluid stool is blood from the upper part of
the intestine or stomach.The spreading of an ulcer may open a vessel
of some size, and a fatal hemorrhage follow.A yellow tint like that of
a child's movement may arise from a mixture of pus and fecal matter.Pus, as a milky or creamy fluid which may be {708} streaked with blood,
is a frequent appearance in disease of the rectum and sigmoid flexure.The odor of the stools is fecal, sour, or sickening from fermentation
or offensive from decomposition.In bad forms of chronic diarrhoea in
children the black watery stools have a most offensive odor.Mucus is the most constant ingredient of the diarrhoeal stool, and is
in itself a sufficient evidence of catarrh, as it is not seen in normal
stools except as a temporary phenomenon.It is present in flakes in
watery evacuations, giving a jelly-like character to the fluid if it is
in excess, or it is mixed with semi-solid feces.Pure mucus may be
passed, if the catarrh is low down, in clear, glairy, or opaque masses.The frog's-egg or boiled-sago particles supposed by Niemeyer and others
to point to follicular ulceration, and by Traube to be the swallowed
bronchial secretion, are said by Virchow to be partly-digested starch,
and also by Nothnagel to be of vegetable nature.[33] The stools may
contain small yellow or brownish masses which are mucoid in nature,
being yellow from bile-staining.Pavement epithelial cells are found in
the coating of mucus around a hard fecal lump.Cylindrical epithelium
is passed uncolored or stained with bile.These cells are separated,
and are deformed and shrunken, with a granular protoplasm and
indistinct nucleus.Round cells in the form
of mucus-corpuscles or giant-cells are mixed with shreds of mucus or
float in the thin stools.Crystals of triple phosphate, of neutral
phosphate, oxalate of lime, and other lime salts, and of cholesterin,
are also seen.[Footnote 33: _Virchow's Archiv_, v. S.329; Nothnagel, "Zur Klinik der
Darmkrankheiten," _Zeitschrift fur klin.Med._, iii., 1881, p.Micrococci and bacteria have no pathological importance; they are seen
in different diseases and in health.Unaltered food may be expelled (lientery) by rapid peristaltic
movements.But the microscope will detect what cannot be seen by the
eye--unaltered starch-granules, filaments of meat-fibre, or fat in
drops or in needle-shaped or feathery crystals.The nervous system is disturbed after a certain time.There is languor,
with depression of spirits, mental weariness, and inaptitude for work
of any kind.The patient is querulous, morose; his sleep is restless,
but sometimes profound until disturbed by the demand to empty the
bowel.Melancholia is attributed to this as to other diseases of the
abdomen, but their influence in producing insanity is doubtful.[34]

[Footnote 34: Griesinger, _Mental Path.ed., New
York, 1882, pp.No decided symptoms are exhibited in the respiratory and circulatory
systems.Even slight exertion will cause shortness of breath and
increased frequency or palpitation of the heart.This irritability of
the heart is a marked feature of the disease.Daniel moved to the bedroom.[35]

phosphatic deposit, or it is scanty and high-.In bad cases
albumen and casts have been found.[36]

[Footnote 36: Alonzo Clark, "Proc.The symptom indicative of atrophy of the mucous membrane is believed by
Nothnagel to be the persistent passage of one soft, unformed stool
daily.Mucus and fat, which diminish the consistence of the stool, are
{709} excluded by microscopical examination.One stool daily shows that
there is no exaggerated peristalsis which hurries the food along so
rapidly that water cannot be absorbed.[37]

[Footnote 37: Nothnagel, "Zur Klinik der Darmkrankheiten," _Zeitschrift
fur klin.Med._, iv., 1882, p.PROGRESS AND TERMINATION.--As the disease advances it is marked by
progressive emaciation and debility.The skin gradually acquires great
pallor, indicating profound anaemia.An exacerbation of the disease will in a few days cause the cheeks to
grow hollow, the eyes to appear sunken with dark rings around them.In
all cases of long duration the progress is intermittent; frequent
relapses occur from which the patient may rally and regain a moderate
degree of flesh.Recovery may take place in weeks or months--eighteen
months is the average duration[38]--but in most instances a tendency to
a recurrence of the diarrhoea from cold, fatigue, or indiscretions in
diet will continue throughout life.An incomplete recovery may take
place by the cessation of the diarrhoea and formation of a stricture
from the healing of an intestinal ulcer.In the worst cases there is no
rule as to the rapidity or regularity of the march of the disease.[Footnote 38: C. H. Ralfe, Seamen's Hospital, London: see Aitken's
_Handbook of Treatment_, New York, 1882, p.When the advance is toward a fatal issue the emaciation progresses
until it becomes extreme; nothing but skin and bone are left.The
cuticle is hard and dry, pale or brownish in color.The muscular
strength is so reduced that the patient is unable to move from bed.The nervous depression and moroseness
assumes a more marked character.Among the soldiers during the Civil
War who had undergone great privations with insufficient or improper
diet the mental phenomena were those of dementia.[39] In them the
disease was modified also by the symptoms of scurvy and malarial
poisoning.[Footnote 39: W. Kempler, "Entero-Colitis," _Am.Fever is seen in the late stages; it is nocturnal at first, and later
assumes the features of hectic.The pulse grows more frequent and
thready; aphthous deposits appear on the inside of the mouth and
pharynx.Toward the end the discharges may become more frequent and
very abundant; they are more fluid, lighter  or black, with
floating particles of blood and mucus.There may be a loss of odor or
they may have a cadaveric smell.Death takes place in a few weeks or after years of alternate suffering
and relief.The immediate causes of death are exhaustion, marasmus from
starvation, collapse from perforation of an intestinal ulcer and
consecutive peritonitis, syncope from sudden exertion, pneumonia, or
acute pulmonary congestion, pleurisy, or subarachnoid effusion in the
brain, with coma and convulsions.COMPLICATIONS.--General dropsy results from the hydraemia and languid
circulation of the late period of the disease.Other causes of this
symptom are coincident diseases of the liver, kidney, or the malarial
cachexia.Oedema of one extremity follows a thrombus in the crural
vein.Chronic bronchitis and pulmonary phthisis are sometimes met with.Acute pneumonia[40] and acute pulmonary congestion are occasional {710}
causes of death.Peritonitis may occur with and without perforation.The latter variety begins as a local inflammation of subacute or
chronic nature, and spreads slowly until it becomes general.Extensive
adhesions and abundant accumulations of serous, sero-purulent, or
purulent fluid in the abdominal cavity result.[Footnote 40: Pneumonia (8 double and 12 single) occurred in 20 out of
41 fatal cases reported by Harrison Allen, _Tr.Philada._,
1867, vol.The causal conditions which have been enumerated may be considered as
complications.They are tuberculosis, Bright's disease, cirrhosis of
the liver, abdominal tumors, scurvy, tubercular and other neoplasms in
the wall of the intestine; attacks of intercurrent, intermittent, or
remittent fever arise from the malarial influence to which the
intestinal catarrh is due.These fevers and rheumatism and
pseudo-rheumatism are complications in soldiers from the exposure to
malarial influences and to cold and dampness.[41]

[Footnote 41: Woodward, _op.Ulceration of the cornea, escape of the aqueous humor, and collapse of
the eye were observed in quite a number of cases occurring among
soldiers.[42]

[Footnote 42: Elliot Coues, _Med.Reporter_, Philada., 1863,
vol.207, and H. Allen, _Tr.SEQUELAE.--The alteration of structure from long-standing inflammation
leaves the mucous membrane prone to recurrence of inflammation.Chronic
intestinal indigestion and permanent malnutrition come from the same
cause.The glandular and lymphatic structures of the intestine and the
mesenteric glands are so changed by disease that they imperfectly
perform their function.Tabes mesenterica is the ultimate phase of this
change.Constipation succeeds chronic diarrhoea, and is due to atony of
the muscular wall from long-continued distension, and probably from
degeneration of the muscular structure.A more serious cause of
constipation, and sometimes of intestinal obstruction, is found in
stenosis of the bowel from the healing of the ulcers of long-standing
chronic catarrh.Stricture is more common in the colon, sigmoid
flexure, and rectum.How frequently such a result follows the
cicatrization of intestinal ulcers is not definitely known.Woodward
concludes from a careful search of books and pathological museums that
stenosis from this cause is very rare.[43] Syphilis is the most common
cause of ulcer.Local or general peritonitis leads to the formation of
adhesions or fibrous bands uniting neighboring links of intestine.By
the contracting of these narrowing of the intestinal canal may result.Paralysis, hemiplegia, paraplegia, etc.have been found to follow upon
diarrhoea of long standing.[44]

[Footnote 43: Woodward, _op.[Footnote 44: Potain, "Paresie des Membres inferieurs ayant succede a
un Catarrhe gastro-intestinal," _Rev.Med.-Chir._, Paris,
1880, xlvii.562; "Paralysis spinale secondaire a une Diarrhee
chronique," _Journ.Prat._, Paris, 1880, 3, S. ii.DIAGNOSIS.--The mild form of chronic catarrh of the intestines
associated with constipation has been confounded with hepatic
disorders, and the obscure symptoms attending it have been attributed
to excess or diminution of bile, and medicines to regulate the liver
have been given accordingly.In the absence of lesions in the liver, in
cases where symptoms such as have been described have preceded death,
the opinion is not justified that disease of this organ has existed.On
the contrary, alteration in the mucous membrane is almost always found,
which points to the true nature of the disease.The diagnosis is based
upon the accompanying {711} gastric catarrh and upon the symptoms of
intestinal indigestion and malnutrition.Greater sensibility to
pressure over the right hypochondrium and along the line of the colon,
pain one to two hours after eating, with distension of the abdomen, the
passage of well-formed and somewhat indurated feces mixed or coated
with mucus, are symptoms peculiar to these mild forms.The tendency to diarrhoea from cold, indigestible food, etc.which
marks the second form of mild catarrh is easily recognized.The characteristic symptom of the severe form is the persistent
diarrhoea.Paroxysmal pains, tympanites and rumbling of gas, tenderness
on pressure over the colon, the alternate periods of improvement and
relapse, with the constitutional signs of impaired nutrition and
progressive anaemia and debility, point out the nature and the seat of
the lesion with sufficient clearness.It is futile to attempt to
distinguish chronic intestinal diarrhoea from chronic dysentery.The
lesions of the two conditions are essentially the same; it depends upon
the fancy as to which name is given to the lesions described here under
the title chronic intestinal catarrh.A greater amount of blood and
mucus in the stool with tenesmus would more properly be called
dysenteric, but the same case may present at one time diarrhoeal, at
another dysenteric, symptoms.Primary must be distinguished from secondary diarrhoea.Therefore the
liver, heart, and lungs must be examined to discover diseases which
might cause portal congestion.Any constitutional malady may be a cause
and an explanation: tuberculosis or pulmonary phthisis stands first in
its influence; next, chronic Bright's disease, septicaemia, scurvy,
syphilis, and gout are attended by intercurrent diarrhoea.If all
general disease can be excluded and the morbid process be located in
the intestine alone, its cause may be known by studying the habits,
occupation, and diet of the patient.Foreign bodies--hardened feces,
gall-stones, fruit-stones, etc.--are possible causes which the history
of the case may point to.Having located the disease in the intestine and decided upon its
primary or secondary nature, it remains to determine more precisely
(_a_) the locality of the lesion, and (_b_) the stage of the
inflammatory process.(_a_) In what part of the intestinal canal is the disease located?It
must be remembered that in typical and fatal cases the large intestine
is the home par excellence of the lesions of chronic catarrh, and that
the lower part of the ileum is often associated in the morbid
processes, but limited areas of the small or large intestine are
affected in mild forms which yield readily to treatment.Icterus, clay- stools, and bile in the urine show that the
catarrh is in the duodenum and involves the opening of the common
bile-duct.The absence of diarrhoea, with flatulence and colics, limits
the area of inflammation to the duodenum.Symptoms of duodenal
indigestion accompany this form of catarrh; the failure of bile to
neutralize the acid chyme impairs the effect of the pancreatic
secretion.Fats are not digested and there is fatty diarrhoea.To this
may be added tenderness in the right hypochondrium, and pain and
oppression in the epigastrium and to the right one hour after eating.There may be wasting and hypochondriasis.{712} The lower part of the duodenum below the opening of the
bile-duct, the jejunum, and the ileum can be taken together as forming
the small intestine.Chronic catarrh of the small intestine is attended
with pain about the umbilicus, which comes on immediately or in one
hour after taking food.Tympanitic distension gives a full, rounded
prominence to the abdomen, which is more central than lateral, and
greater below the umbilicus than above it.It is accompanied by a sense
of oppression, which is greater after eating.Inability to digest food
consisting largely of starch or sugar, as well as tardiness in the
digestion of all foods, with resulting loss of flesh, are signs of
intestinal indigestion.There may be no diarrhoea; if there is,
important help to diagnosis can be gained by examining the stools.They
contain undigested or partly-altered meat-fibre and starch-granules,
discoverable only by the microscope.The discharges are soft and pulpy
from an intimate admixture of mucus.To the naked eye no mucus is
visible, but a thin layer under the microscope shows clear islets of
pure mucus, or mucus may only be detected by the adhesion of the
covering-glass to the slide.Bile-stained epithelium and globules of
stained mucus are seen in the liquid stools from catarrh of the small
intestine and of the ascending colon.There is the characteristic
reaction and play of color on testing for bile-pigment.These are
evidences that the stool with the bile has been hurried along the ileum
and colon, and expelled before the transformation in the coloring
matter has had time to take place.[45]

[Footnote 45: "II.Abtheilung, Diagnostische Bemerkungen zur
Localisation der Catarrhe," _Zeitschrift fur klinische Medicin_,
Berlin, 1882, iv.In catarrh of the large intestine there is sensitiveness to pressure
along the line of the colon; the distension of the abdomen is not
uniform, depending upon the prominence of the transverse or descending
colon.The pains are more severe and precede the stools, which are more
frequent and larger than in catarrh of the ileum.The discharges are
pulpy or watery.Globules of mucus are visible to the naked eye, and
mucus is intimately mixed with fecal matter.If the lower half of the colon is chiefly the seat of the disease, pure
mucus coats the more solid stool and is in its substance.With catarrh
limited to the descending colon scybalae are imbedded in mucus.From
the sigmoid flexure and rectum larger masses of mucus, without fecal
matter or with it, are expelled.Pure lumps of mucus, mixed or stained
with red blood and without fecal matter, indicate catarrh of the
rectum--proctitis.(_b_) The stage of the process of inflammation is diagnosed by the
condition of the patient, the course of the disease, and the character
of the stools.As long as there is a pulpy fecal diarrhoea, with no
blood, pus, or fragments of tissue and no marked emaciation or fever,
and with a tendency to improvement under favorable conditions, there is
every reason to believe that there is no ulceration.In follicular ulceration the course of the disease is essentially
chronic, and is marked by periods of improvement under careful
treatment, with exacerbations and relapses from slight causes of
irritation.There is progressive emaciation and debility, with fever of
hectic character, which is worse in the later stages.The movements are frequent and liquid, and are without
odor or fetid.They {713} contain mucus, glassy-gray or green,
pus-cells imbedded in masses of mucus, blood in small amount, but
sometimes abundant, and shreds of the tissue of the mucous membrane.The higher the ulcer the less marked is the diarrhoea.The lower its
situation the greater is the frequency of the stools and the more
liable are they to be accompanied by tenesmus and to contain blood and
pus.Toward the last, ulceration is accompanied by rapid emaciation,
fever, sweats, a feeble circulation, a dry tongue, great thirst, and
oedema of the feet and ankles.Death takes place by gradual exhaustion,
more rarely from perforation and peritonitis or from intestinal
hemorrhage.[46]

[Footnote 46: Nothnagel, "Die Symptomatologie der Darmgeschwure,"
_Klinische Vortrage Volkmann_, No.Duodenal ulcer is with difficulty recognized during life.[47] The
following are the symptoms which have preceded death from this lesion:
Profuse hemorrhage from the bowel, vomiting of food as well as blood,
icterus, dysphagia, hiccough, oppression in the epigastrium after
eating, attacks of cardialgia with tenderness on pressure in the right
hypochondrium, and sudden death with symptoms of collapse.If these
symptoms follow an extensive burn of the skin, they are easily referred
to a duodenal ulcer.[Footnote 47: W. L. Loomis, "Perforating Ulcer of Duodenum and Sudden
Death."For two years the patient had suffered with dyspepsia and
epigastric pain after eating, was gouty, and had lost flesh.Autopsy:
atheroma of arteries, beginning cirrhosis of kidneys, walls of stomach
thickened, perforated ulcer one inch below pylorus (_Med.Record New
York_, 1879, vol.188; also _Boston City Hospital Report_, 1882,
p.Tuberculous ulcers are distinguished from follicular ulcers by the
history of hereditary predisposition, the existence of pulmonary
tuberculosis, higher fever, and more rapid emaciation and debility.A cancerous ulcer may be the cause of bloody stools; it is usually
within reach of the finger in the rectum; the mass exercises pressure
upon the prostate, and at times occludes the bowel, causing
obstruction.The cachexia and rapid decline are not seen in catarrhal
ulceration.PROGNOSIS.--Chronic catarrh of the intestine is most fatal in children.Among infants artificially fed, when the illness develops and continues
during hot weather, the mortality is very great.Recovery in the young
is rendered less probable if chronic diarrhoea is associated with
rickets, scrofula, or tuberculosis.If the catarrh in adults is a complication of some previously existing
constitutional disease, as Bright's disease or scurvy, or is connected
with lesions of the liver, spleen, heart, or lungs, there is less hope
of cure.In old persons this disease has a special gravity.The longer the disease has lasted before treatment is begun, and the
longer it continues without being influenced by treatment, the more
unfavorable will be the prognosis.Discouraging symptoms are an
uninterrupted loss of flesh and strength, lientery, hectic fever,
relapses notwithstanding care in diet, and the signs of
ulceration--blood, pus, and tissue-shreds in the stools, with an odor
of decomposition.Favorable promises may be based upon a hearty willingness of the
patient to submit to the strictest regimen and to subordinate his life
to the plans of treatment, the absence of other diseases, early
improvement in his general condition and local symptoms under rest and
diet.A {714} complete cure cannot be assumed to exist unless the
patient has passed one or more years without a relapse.TREATMENT.--As chronic intestinal catarrh is a complication of so many
conditions, the prevention of it becomes a matter of great importance
and of very general application.All rules for preserving
health--temperance in eating and drinking, bathing, exercise, good
ventilation, the avoidance of overwork, both mental and physical--are
so many means for escaping an intestinal catarrh which may present
itself as an indigestion with constipation or as a diarrhoea.The special liability of infants and children, and to a less extent of
very old persons, and the greater dangers they run, call for the most
careful selection of appropriate diet at these periods of life.Where there is hereditary predisposition, idiosyncrasy, chronic
diseases of organs, or constitutional diseases, an easily-digested
dietary should be supplemented by precautions against chilling of the
surface by the wearing of flannel underclothing and woollen socks.The etiology of each case may at once suggest a line of treatment.Among the causes which point to appropriate measures are--the continued
presence in the bowel of indigestible or undigested food, constant
exposure to cold or to changes of temperature, chronic cardiac disease
and portal congestion from any cause, chronic cachexiae, as syphilis,
malaria, tuberculosis, or Bright's disease, the crowding together of
individuals in prisons, asylums, etc.The mildest form of intestinal catarrh characterized by intestinal
indigestion and constipation or by the passage of fecal matter more or
less solid, mixed or coated with mucus, is best treated by a diet such
as is advised for intestinal indigestion, bathing with friction,
outdoor life, exercise on horseback or by walking, pleasurable
occupations, and travel.Iron if there is anaemia, and strychnia if
there is a sluggish capillary circulation, with cold hands and feet,
are available and useful in many cases.Massage and the Swedish
movement treatment find useful application in feeble men and in women
who are not strong enough for outdoor exercise.To aid the digestion
the liquor pancreaticus as advised by Roberts, a teaspoonful one hour
and a half to two hours after each meal, with ten to twenty grains of
the bicarbonate of sodium, is, theoretically at least, to be warmly
recommended.The Rockbridge alum water, a small glass three times daily
between meals, has astringency enough for the hyperaemic membrane and
is of good service without increasing constipation.Purgatives should be avoided as much as possible.An enema of cool
water, not more than a tumblerful, taken each morning after breakfast
if persevered in, may do all that is needed in this direction.If it
fails to empty the bowel completely, a larger enema of warm water--one
pint--holding in solution sulphate of zinc or alum in the strength of
one grain to three or four ounces, can be thrown high up with a rubber
tube once daily.This acts upon the mucous surface, constringes mildly
the congested vessels, and when expelled brings away the retained fecal
matter.These astringent rectal injections offer promise of cure in
many obstinate cases where the colon is chiefly the seat of disease.Belladonna is advised for cases of this kind in combination with
strychnia for the constipation.Bedford mineral water, Hunyadi water, or other salines and the less
active vegetable {715} cathartics, can be given alternately.Ipecacuanha has had quite a reputation in combination with purgatives
in intestinal catarrh.Aloin pills empty the bowel without much
attendant irritation.The form of catarrh which shows itself in a tendency to diarrhoea
from indiscretions in diet or from exposure to cold must receive
prophylactic treatment.Especially in this form is it important to
improve the activity of the skin by bathing and friction, and to lead a
temperate life in all things, regulating the diet according to the
rules already stated.Fowler's
solution of arsenic (one drop before each meal, Ringer), the
potassio-tartrate or the tincture of the chloride of iron, dilute
sulphuric acid, nitro-muriatic or hydrochloric acid, are efficient in
improving digestive activity or in opposing the anaemia which is nearly
always present.Quinia is indicated in malarial anaemia with a
disposition to loose bowels.Quassia or other vegetable bitters can be
given if the appetite is languid; the bitters are, as a rule, of little
benefit, and may do harm if diarrhoea exists.Strychnia with quassia or
columbo stimulates the appetite and the gastric digestion.When
intercurrent attacks of diarrhoea come on with coated tongue,
flatulence, distress about the umbilicus after eating, bismuth given on
an empty stomach in full doses is serviceable.Small doses of morphia
or of opium in some form can be added to the bismuth if there is much
pain or when the stools are frequent.In this and in other forms of intestinal catarrh mineral waters are
profitably employed.They are best taken at their sources; and here, as
in the case of sea-bathing, the benefit is largely due to the change of
air and scene and to the more simple mode of life.Any of the
watering-places where alkaline-saline waters or ferruginous waters are
found may be of benefit.A trip to Europe and a stay at Carlsbad will
break up many an obstinate case of chronic abdominal disorder; but
other beneficial waters in Europe are Tarosp, Rohitsch, Marienbad,
Kissengen, and Plombieres.In this country the comfort and conveniences of the summer hotels and
climate are as much to be considered as the chemical composition of the
waters.For milder forms of catarrh with constipation a season at
Saratoga, with a life of temperance there, is a wise procedure.Bedford
Springs, Pa., offer the same advantages in part, but the waters are
best suited to catarrh with constipation.Many of the Virginia springs
benefit health-seekers who do not place too much reliance upon the
virtues of the waters, and who trust to the value of pure air,
exercise, diversion, and rest.All plans of treatment for the more severe form of catarrh with
chronic diarrhoea (follicular enteritis) must be based upon a knowledge
of the lesions.Bearing in mind the alterations in the mucous and
submucous tissues, it is clear that no treatment can be successful
which is not carried out with the most careful attention to details,
and which is not continued for some time after all the symptoms of the
disease have ceased.The complete resolution of hypertrophied glandular
tissue, the scattering of cell-accumulations, and the healing of ulcers
can only be secured in this way.It is best to present the whole case
before the patient, so as to enlist in the task his intelligent
co-operation.Directions for the guidance of cases of this kind must include every
{716} detail of the patient's life.The question of residence is of
importance to begin with.A cool and dry climate is better than a wet
and warm one, and where other means fail change of climate is sometimes
the only cure.A sea-voyage, a residence in a mountain-region, will
oftentimes promptly and effectually cure an obstinate diarrhoea.House-drainage and ventilation should be examined into and improved.The occupation may have developed the disease; in overwork may lie the
origin and the cause of its continuance.Rest from work is therefore in
some instances the one thing needed.In all cases the energies and the
brain should not be overtaxed.The bath to keep the skin active can be
combined with friction.The hot bath, as hot as can be borne, is the
best.It is a stimulant, not a depressant, as is the tepid bath, and it
is safer than the cold bath.The cold sitz bath or the application of cold compresses diminishes
abdominal plethora, and is wisely advised in strong persons who are not
depressed or chilled by external cold.Sea-bathing is another
hydro-therapeutic measure which is of unquestioned advantage in all
forms of intestinal catarrh.Permanent baths have been found very serviceable in many chronic
diseases, and there are many reasons for advising them in obstinate
diarrhoeas.There can be no better means for bringing to bear a strong
and continued influence upon the intestinal mucous membrane.The
patient should be kept in the warm bath for one, two, or three weeks,
according to his strength and the effect upon the disease.Systematic
hot bathing under the direction of a physician at Richfield, Sharon,
the Hot Springs of Virginia or Arkansas, is an invaluable aid.Rest in the recumbent position for cases where the symptoms indicate
marked tissue-alteration is very often the most important part of the
treatment.Rest and diet are alone necessary to cure many cases, and
without these combined means relief is often impossible.The rest
should be absolute, the patient using a bed-pan and lying down all the
time.The contraindications for this method are a slight diarrhoea
which yields to other treatment, and loss of strength and appetite from
the deprivation of air and exercise.If rest is not advisable, or does no good after a fair trial of two to
four weeks, outdoor life in fair weather by driving or walking slowly
can be suggested.A long drive will bring back a diarrhoea which has
taken many weeks to relieve.The rules for diet must be clearly given and strictly enforced.An
exclusive milk diet should have a trial in every case.Skimmed milk can
be taken in larger quantities and with less repulsion, and is therefore
to be preferred.The exclusive milk diet can be varied with buttermilk,
koumiss, or wine-whey; and fruit-juices, as orange-juice, lime-juice,
or tamarind-water, please the patient without doing harm.In the case
of adults as well as children the milk is made more digestible by
diluting it with barley- or rice-water or by adding transformed
farinaceous food to milk in the form of Mellin's food and other foods
of this class.Animal broths, as chicken-soup and beef-tea, are well digested if
properly made and given in small quantities.Raw meat scraped, beef or
mutton rare and thoroughly masticated, the breast of poultry, game,
broiled fish, raw oysters, raw or very slightly boiled eggs, or
sweetbread, are foods from which selection can be made to add variety
to the dietary.{717} Saccharine, starchy, and fatty foods are to be
given as little as possible.Vegetables may be added to the list as the
condition improves.Rice and fine hominy (grits) are to be thought of
first, as being easily digested and nourishing.Good wine in moderation
is not hurtful; the red wines diluted with water are the best, but good
port, tokay, and whiskey well diluted find application in particular
cases.Whatever food be given, it should be taken in the quantities and at
hours prescribed by the physician, who by careful inspection of the
stools judges of the necessity of changes in his regulations and of the
success of his treatment.The further treatment of chronic diarrhoea has for its object by the
aid of drugs to change the anatomical state of the mucous membrane.Manifestly, the choice depends upon the state of this tissue.In the
earlier stages the increased vascularity and hypersecretion call for
mild astringents or for medicines which are believed empirically to
oppose these conditions.When drugs can be dispensed with, it is better
to do so; they should always be made subordinate to the careful regimen
already described.Bismuth in large doses (ten to thirty grains) is a safe and efficacious
remedy in this stage.Nitrate of silver in pill form (one-sixth to
one-fourth of a grain) has the endorsement of Wm.Pepper and many other
practitioners.It should be continued for two or three weeks at least,
but it may be given in small doses during several months, with
intermissions, without danger of silver staining.[48]

[Footnote 48: A case is recorded of silver staining of the skin after
four weeks' administration (Woodward, _op.A routine administration of any drug or class of drugs is
reprehensible, and from the numerous remedies which are advocated in
chronic diarrhoea selection can be made for trial in the course of
intractable cases.The list would include sulphate of copper
(one-fourth to one-half a grain), the liquid preparations of iron
(liquor ferri nitratis, tinct.ferri chloridi), dilute nitric and
sulphuric acids, gallic acid and other vegetable astringents, oxide or
sulphate of zinc, alum, precipitated phosphate of calcium, salicin,
corrosive sublimate (1/100 gr.every hour), the Indian bael-fruit, etc.No remedy should be abandoned until it has been continuously given for
one or more weeks.alum water is markedly astringent, is not
unpleasant, and may be used as a substitute for water with advantage.In fact, there is no better way of introducing in quantity a mild
astringent into the intestine than by the drinking of this water.Cold-water rectal irrigation has a sedative and astringent influence,
and when properly used is of great advantage to both children and
adults.[49] The patient should be placed in the proper position, and
the water made to enter the rectum as high up as possible.The number
of stools lessens almost immediately after this treatment, peristalsis
being inhibited thereby.[Footnote 49: A long rectal rubber tube, such as advised by
Surgeon-General Wales, U.S.N., serves this purpose well.]To the water used in irrigation astringents may be added in small
doses.Sulphate of zinc, sugar of lead, or alum may be given in this
way in the strength of one grain to four or six ounces of water.This
{718} method of treatment promises more and is more rational than the
internal administration of drugs.Opium and its preparations should be avoided except to control frequent
or watery discharges or to relieve pain, but it is not often that this
is called for if wiser measures are first employed.Any of the remedies
spoken of may be given in the form of suppositories with greater
advantage often than by the mouth.In that more severe class of cases called follicular ulceration, in
which the follicles are known to be ulcerated from a prolongation of
the illness, the obstinacy of the diarrhoea, the character of the
discharges, and the effect upon the general health, other measures are
to be adopted.The diet should be most strictly regulated and the
digestive power of the patient carefully studied.Cod-liver oil is
added with advantage to other foods if there is a lack of nutrition.Aids to gastric digestion are called for.The intestinal lesion is to be reached through the stomach or the
rectum.Nitrate of silver in small doses is more especially applicable,
and is to be preferred to all other drugs in this stage.It is to be
given in small doses and for several weeks.Turpentine and copaiba have something in their favor in ulceration.Ergot has been suggested, and where there is much hemorrhage from the
bowel may be prescribed.Irrigations with solutions of nitrate of silver seem to be a direct and
certain remedy in cases where ulceration has existed for a long time.Two and a half to three pints of distilled water, holding in solution
five grains of nitrate of silver, should be thrown up the rectum as
high as possible with a rubber tube; the effort should be made to
secure immediate exit to the fluid.This procedure is to be repeated
after the bowels are moved--once every day or every other day if the
rectum becomes irritable.[50]

CHOLERA MORBUS.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Cholera nostras, Sporadic cholera, European or English
cholera, Spasmodic cholera, Cholera biliosa, Passio cholerica,
Cholerhagia, Trousse-galant, Die Gallenruhr, Brechruhr.DEFINITION.--An affection of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane
characterized by violent abdominal pain, nausea, and sudden, violent,
and incessant vomiting, and by purging of a watery fluid containing
little albumen and bile; attended with spasms of the muscles of the
abdomen and extremities, a pinched and sunken countenance, pallor,
cyanosis, and coldness of the surface of the body; a feeble and rapid
pulse, oppressed respiration, and great restlessness; dryness of the
tongue, great thirst, and diminished or suppressed urinary secretion
and a state approaching collapse, which may rarely prove fatal, but is,
as a rule, followed by reaction.HISTORY.--The term cholera has been in use since the time of
Hippocrates, but he confounded with it every disease which seemed to
him to come from acridity or corruption of humors, as colics and
meteorism with constipation.[1] He well described cholera morbus in
saying that "it is a disease which appears in summer, due to imprudence
in eating, at the same time as intermittent fever."[2] If Celsus be
correct in deriving the name from [Greek: chole] "bile," and [Greek:
reo] "I flow," it is more applicable to the disease now under
consideration than to the Asiatic disease, as it is the bile which is
absent in the colorless rice-water discharges of Asiatic cholera.Trallian and Ruysch, however, ascribe it to [Greek: cholera] the
rain-gutter of a house.les Maladies aigues_, 19, ii.[Footnote 2: _Epidemies_, lib.In the Old Testament mention is made of a disease resembling cholera
morbus.[3] Its true pathogeny was known to Galen, and it was accurately
described by Celsus,[4] and Aretaeus[5] mentions the nature of the
discharges and its frequency among young people and children.des Maladies epidemiques_, Paris, 1825.]The first mention of epidemics was in the sixteenth century.Various
epidemics in 1695, 1717, and 1718 in Germany were probably cholera
morbus.Forestus[6] reports seven observations from 1559 to 1565 of
attacks due to indigestible food or drastic medicines.F. Hoffman,[7]
{720} J. Frank,[8] and L. Riviere speak of the benignity of the disease
as contrasting it with its apparently dangerous symptoms.[Footnote 6: _Opera Omnia_, Rothomagi, 1633, "De stomachi affectibus,"
lib.[Footnote 7: _Medicina rationalis systemica_, t. iv.[Footnote 8: _Praxeos medicae universae praecepta_, Leipzig, 1826, p.Sydenham's[9] description of the epidemics in England in 1669-72 is the
earliest account of the disease in modern literature, and it was he who
gave it the name cholera morbus.NATURE.--There prevails at the present time a great diversity of
opinion in regard to its nature; the want of uniformity in the
appearances presented by post-mortem examinations may in some measure
account for this.The present state of our knowledge, derived both from
pathological anatomy and a study of the symptoms, will not warrant a
positive opinion in regard to it.Niemeyer,[10] in common with most German and some French authors,
considers cholera morbus to be a variety of gastro-intestinal catarrh.Leube[11] thinks it a variety of gastric catarrh with simultaneous
inflammation of the intestines and running a peculiar course.It is
certainly not identical with the specific Asiatic disease, although in
some cases the symptoms and morbid anatomy are exactly similar, and any
differentiation is impossible.By some it is believed that cholera
morbus is due to surviving germs implanted by previous epidemics of
Asiatic cholera.[Footnote 11: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, New York, 1876, vol.The slight changes found in some fatal cases would lead to the belief
that the effect of the exciting cause is something more than a
mechanical irritation of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane.The sudden onset, rapid development of symptoms, and dangerous collapse
justify the theory that there must be some previous change in the
individual or some peculiar result of food-decomposition.The nervous
system may be so enfeebled by prolonged heat that an irritant quickly
destroys its equilibrium and brings about vaso-motor paralysis of the
intestinal vessels and abundant serum transudation.Or the irritation
may be specific, depending upon the development of poison germs in food
which has been subjected to heat influences.There is a close
relationship between cholera morbus and cholera infantum in their
etiology, symptoms, and pathology.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing Causes.--The disease is more common in the
tropics, but is not confined to any climate.In temperate latitudes it
is more likely to occur in July and August, when the variation of
temperature between day and night is great, although the other months
of summer and autumn are not entirely exempt.It is said to be more
frequent and fatal in Southern Europe than in the northern and
temperate climates.In periods immediately preceding and following
epidemics of Asiatic cholera many persons are attacked, although there
is great liability to errors in diagnosis at these times.It occurs more frequently in youth and adolescence than in advanced
life, and males seem to be more liable to attacks than females, but
difference in occupation may assist in this predisposition.Persons
endowed with an extreme sensibility of the nervous system and who are
subject to frequent attacks of intestinal catarrh are much more liable
to the disease.The exhaustion of the nervous system by heat, which is
the {721} probable explanation of the phenomena of cholera infantum,
has no doubt much to do with the development of cholera morbus.Mental
anxiety or overwork in summer increases this nerve-exhaustion and
renders the termini of nerves and the centres very susceptible to
peculiar irritation.Exciting Causes.--It is probable that the cause of most attacks is a
septic material generated in the fermentation and decomposition of
food.This poison acts as an irritant upon the gastric and intestinal
nerves and gives rise to excessive peristaltic movements and vomiting.Hence the quality of the food is an element of more importance in the
causation than the mere quantity ingested; and herein may reside the
chief difference between cholera morbus and Asiatic cholera, the latter
being due to a specific, imported, or acclimated poison which
invariably produces the same specific form in those exposed to its
action.[12] Unripe fruits, partially cooked or decaying meats and
vegetables, shellfish and fish some time from the water, may produce
the disease in those predisposed to it.The intemperate use of
ice-water and other cold drinks after a full meal or when the body is
exhausted by heat and fatigue, exposure to showers at the close of a
hot day, or passing from a heated room into damp cellars and
outbuildings, are frequent exciting causes.[Footnote 12: "Bias the pugilist, naturally a great eater, had a sudden
choleraic attack after having eaten of succulent food" (Hippocrates,
lib.At times there exists a certain condition of inactivity of the
digestive organs when the gastric juice is not secreted in sufficient
quantity, and perfectly sound food may undergo fermentation and set up
an attack.The offensive exhalation from a filthy alley which had been recently
cleaned was the exciting cause of a fatal epidemic in a London
school,[13] and Levier recounts an epidemic caused by the
drinking-water during the winter in Berne.[14]

[Footnote 13: _Lond.f. Heilk._, iii., 1864, p.Nervous disturbance from other diseases may act as a cause.Leube
reports a case of intermittent fever which was followed by an annual
attack of cholera morbus preceded by febrile symptoms.[15]

[Footnote 15: Leube, _Ziemssen_, 1876, vol.Malaria, sewer-gas, and sudden and powerful mental emotions are
credited with the causation of some attacks.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--In a few cases an examination of the body has
revealed no phenomena sufficient to account for the symptoms, even when
they have been the most severe during life.In these cases either the
inflammation has not passed the first stage of development and the
resulting hyperaemia has disappeared after death, or the irritation of
the gastro-intestinal nerves has been sufficiently intense to cause
death before the alimentary tract has undergone any consequent
structural change.Usually, however, there are evidences of a general gastro-intestinal
catarrh: the mucous membrane is congested throughout and denuded of
epithelium.The solitary glands are enlarged and Peyer's patches
swollen and prominent.The blood is thickened and dark in color, and
the serous membranes dry, sticky, and covered with desquamated
epithelium.Indeed, the appearances may be identical with those
observed in true Asiatic {722} cholera.The kidneys are congested,
sometimes enlarged, and the tubules devoid of epithelium.In protracted
cases the general muscular system shows a beginning of granular
degeneration.In no case, however, can a positive diagnosis between Asiatic cholera
and cholera morbus be made from post-mortem appearances.SYMPTOMS.--The attack is usually sudden in its onset, but in some cases
is preceded by nausea, thirst, loss of appetite, and slight general
distress for some hours, or it may come on in the course of some
gastro-intestinal disturbance.Frequently it is developed during sleep,
particularly after midnight, the patient being aroused by a feeling of
pressure at the pit of the stomach, which is followed by nausea and
violent and incessant vomiting with intense pain, the contents of the
stomach being ejected with great force.The matters first vomited consist mainly of the food last eaten, little
altered or mixed with gastric mucus and tinged with bile.In a certain
proportion of cases the amount of bile is increased, although it is
difficult to judge of the relative proportion by the color and taste of
the vomited liquid.The general belief that the liver is implicated and
the bile secreted in morbid quantity rests upon conjecture alone, and
has no solid basis.After a time only yellow, brown, or greenish mucus,
with more or less bile, is ejected, and in protracted cases hiccough is
most distressing.Following the vomiting or at the same time with it purging comes on,
and it is usually preceded by borborygmi.In rare cases there is no
vomiting, but only intense pain in the bowels and copious alvine
discharges from the beginning to the end of the attack.The stools in
the beginning are normal in color, but soon become pulpy or semi-fluid.As they increase in quantity they become watery, consisting of
blood-serum with mucus, cast-off epithelium and pus-cells, and are
nearly odorless, and sometimes resemble very closely the discharges of
Asiatic cholera, but almost invariably retain the yellow or green color
of the bile.Colorless rice-water discharges are observed in undoubted
cases of cholera morbus outside of any epidemic influence.The
discharges are acrid and irritating, and the neighboring parts become
red and excoriated.At the same time there is intense burning or tearing pain in the
abdomen, generally centring at the umbilicus, great thirst and painful
contractions of the muscles of the abdomen and extremities,
particularly in the calves of the legs, and of the flexors of the
thighs, forearms, fingers, and toes.In the beginning there may be
tympanites, but this soon disappears, and the abdomen becomes retracted
and the muscles drawn up into knots.The cramps usually come on after
each act of vomiting and purging, but they may appear spontaneously.Abdominal tenderness is either wanting or slight.As the transudation
continues the thirst becomes intense, the tongue cold, dry, and coated,
and the tissues shrivelled from loss of water.The skin is cold,
clammy, or covered with a viscid sweat, and the surface of the body is
cyanosed, violet, or in the extremities it may have a marbled
appearance.The nose is pointed, the eyes dark and sunken, and there is
a general appearance of collapse.The mind may be clear throughout, but in protracted cases there is
great nervous prostration.The patient becomes dull and lethargic,
passing into stupor after great restlessness and jactitation.The voice
is faint {723} or whispering, the breath cold, and the respiration
sighing.The pulse in the beginning may be depressed, but soon becomes
rapid and often imperceptible, and there is great praecordial anxiety.As the blood becomes thickened the urine is highly, small in
quantity, and it may be suppressed.An examination shows traces of
albumen, casts and desquamated epithelium, and a decrease in the amount
of urea and salts.In the last stages there may be a slight rise in
temperature, but it has no definite course and it is usually absent.In
collapse the temperature of the surface of the body sinks below normal,
but the temperature of the interior may rise as high as 101 degrees or
102 degrees F., as shown by the thermometer in the rectum or
vagina.[16]

[Footnote 16: _London Hosp.PROGRESS AND TERMINATION.--But, fortunately, the course of the disease
tends toward recovery in the large majority of cases.The discharges
gradually decrease in quantity, the intervals are longer, the
appearance becomes more natural, and a profuse perspiration is followed
by a refreshing sleep.The surface becomes warmer, the pulse slower and
more full, and the skin regains its normal color.If the case has been a severe one or if it occurs in a person much
enfeebled by disease, it pursues a different course.The discharges
become almost uninterrupted, and at last are passed involuntarily.The
cramps are almost continuous or are convulsive, the pulse grows rapidly
weaker and is finally lost, coma succeeds stupor, and death follows in
collapse.The duration of the disease varies from a few hours to two or three
days; death has occurred within twelve hours.Recovery is generally complete after a few hours; and this rapid return
to the normal condition shows that there have been no textural change
of organs.Sometimes great emaciation, irritability of the stomach, and
slight diarrhoea persist for a few days, or symptoms of a general
gastro-enteritis may supervene.DIAGNOSIS.--In making the diagnosis of cholera morbus it is necessary
to carefully differentiate it from epidemic cholera and the effects
produced by irritant poisons, such as the metallic salts, poisonous
fungi, etc.Occurring during an epidemic of Asiatic cholera, it is not possible to
make a diagnosis, as the symptoms of cholera morbus and of mild cases
of the Asiatic disease are identical.From severe cases it is to be
distinguished by the absence of antecedent diarrhoea, by the presence
of bile in the vomited matters, and by the color and fecal odor of the
stools.The nausea and abdominal pain are more marked, while the
dyspnoea, cyanosis, and shrunken condition of the skin are less marked.The mortality of cholera morbus is slight, whilst about one-half of
those attacked with epidemic cholera die.In irritant poisoning the vomiting follows quickly after the ingestion
of a meal or poisonous matter; it continues for some time before
purging begins, and is out of all proportion to the diarrhoea.The
vomited matters contain blood and mucus and are never serous in
character.Corrosive poisons may cause redness, charring, or ulceration
of the mouth and throat and a burning sensation in the stomach.The
pain over the stomach is more constant and severe, particularly in the
intervals of {724} vomiting, and there may be abdominal tenderness and
bloody discharges.The expression is more anxious and the pulse rapid
and weak.Elaterium and tartar emetic will bring on vomiting and purging which
resemble the symptoms of cholera morbus.Choleriform attacks due to
uraemia simulate cholera morbus.The distinction is to be made by the
previous history--pain and purging being relatively less prominent in
uraemia--by the presence of albumen and casts in the urine, and by the
early tendency to coma.Acute peritonitis, attended by copious vomiting and purging, has been
mistaken for cholera morbus, and the true nature of the affection only
revealed by the autopsy.PROGNOSIS.--As a rule, cholera morbus occurring in persons otherwise
healthy ends favorably in a few hours.Cases of secondary fever, with
gastro-intestinal catarrh, may prolong the attack from a few days to
two weeks.Should treatment have no effect in lessening the vomiting
and purging, and should the evidences of heart-failure become apparent,
a fatal result may be feared.Death has occurred within twelve hours,
and the mortality is 3 per cent.[17]

[Footnote 17: Bartholow, _Pract.Med._, New York, 1880, p.Cases occurring in the course of other diseases possess a special
gravity.TREATMENT.--During the summer months, and particularly in August and
September, when the hot days are succeeded by cool nights, iced drinks
should be used in moderate quantities; the diet should be light,
nutritious, and easy of digestion.Unripe fruits and articles of food
liable to fermentative changes should not be indulged in.Exposure to the night air, particularly after a full meal, should be
especially avoided, and the clothing ought to be so arranged that
additions may be made as night approaches.Slight attacks of
indigestion should not be neglected, and any irregularity of the bowels
must receive immediate attention.The period when the physician is called upon to prescribe for an attack
of cholera morbus is usually when the stomach has been emptied of food
and the patient is vomiting incessantly, purging, and writhing in pain.If vomiting has not occurred and violent epigastric pain is the only
symptom, the stomach should be emptied by an emetic of hot water and
mustard repeated until the overcharged organ is completely emptied.Partially-digested food in a state of acid fermentation will thus be
got rid of, and the sufferings may be immediately but not wholly
relieved.If spontaneous vomiting has expelled the food, and the matters vomited
are green and watery, while pain and frequent stools with muscular
cramps, heart feebleness, and threatening collapse are the symptoms
presented, the remedy par excellence is a hypodermic injection of
sulphate of morphia (gr.1/8 to 1/3) with sulphate of atropia (gr.If one dose is not followed by decided mitigation of
suffering, the injection is to be repeated in a half hour or an hour,
not giving above one grain of morphia in divided doses.At the same
time, and while waiting for the full effect of the narcotic, efforts
can be directed to giving ease to the muscular spasms and pain by brisk
friction with stimulating lotions or by mustard poultices to the
abdomen and extremities.The morphia will be the best and quickest
stimulant which can be used; it will therefore be useless in most cases
to administer brandy, camphor, chloroform, {725} or other remedies of
that sort.Waiting and giving nothing by the mouth is the wiser course.In twenty minutes to half an hour the most perfect bien etre succeeds
to the previous agony and exhaustion.In some cases the vomiting,
purging, and cramps cease more gradually, and six hours will pass
before the patient is at ease.The intense thirst is best treated by
the giving of cracked ice sparingly at first, more freely later.Nothing substitutes morphia hypodermically with success, but in some
instances or when the stomach is not very irritable it may be necessary
to give medicine by the mouth.In this case chloroform (xv to xxx
drops), chlorodyne (x to xx drops), or spirits of camphor (v to x
drops) every quarter or half hour in ice-water may be directed.Chloroform and camphor can be combined with the deodorized tincture of
opium in ten- to twenty-drop doses.Time is wasted in expecting relief
from remedies which are inevitably rejected as soon as taken; it is
only when the stomach is very tolerant that it is judicious to begin
with them.The weakness of the heart's action must be combated by brandy or
whiskey, given by the mouth with pounded ice or administered
hypodermically.A considerable quantity of brandy or diluted alcohol
may be introduced by repeated injections beneath the skin.Iced
champagne may be tried with good effect.H. C. Wood quotes Hall[18] as
recommending hypodermic injections of chloral in the cold stage of
cholera.Five to eight grains in twenty minims of distilled water can
be thus given, and repeated at intervals of fifteen to twenty minutes
until some effect is perceived.[Footnote 18: _Lancet_, May 2, 1874.]If vomiting persists after the other symptoms--pain and muscular
spasms--are relieved, it is due to the intense gastric hyperaemia;
giving nothing which is not necessary is the wiser plan.Carbolic acid,
hydrocyanic acid, bismuth, bromide of sodium, or small doses of calomel
are remedies which meet the indication.Food should be withheld as long
as possible; then iced barley-water, followed by milk and lime-water in
very small quantities at short intervals, will test the power of the
stomach to retain and digest food.{726}

INTESTINAL AFFECTIONS OF CHILDREN IN HOT WEATHER.BY J. LEWIS SMITH, M.D.The summer affections of the intestines in children are chiefly of a
diarrhoeal character.Diarrhoeal attacks, as is well known, are much
more frequent and severe in the summer months than in other portions of
the year.Moreover, the diarrhoea of the summer season occurs chiefly
among children under the age of two and a half years, and is much more
common and fatal in the cities than in the country.In the large cities
this malady has heretofore been the annually-recurring scourge of
infancy, but of late years its prevalence has been in some degree
diminished and its severity controlled by the establishment of health
boards and the enforcement of sanitary regulations.Still, it remains
an important disease in all our cities, and one that largely increases
the aggregate mortality.The truth of this statement is shown by the
statistics of deaths taken at random from the mortuary records of any
large city.Thus, in New York City during 1882 the deaths from
diarrhoea reported to the Health Board, tabulated in months, were as
follows:

        Jan.Under
  five   34   32   50   50   72   231  1533  817   362  195   68   35
  years.Over
  five   14   15   14   20   15    19   131  149    84   55   31   24
  years.Therefore, in 1882--and the statistics of other years correspond in
this particular--it is seen that nine times as many deaths of children
under the age of five years occurred from diarrhoea during the five
months from June 1st to October 31st as in the remaining seven months
of the year.It is also seen, in corroboration of the statement that
diarrhoea due to hot weather is chiefly a disease of infancy and early
childhood, that during these same five months, which embrace the summer
season, the number of deaths from diarrhoea under the age of five years
was seven and a half times greater than the number over that age.These
statistics agree with the general experience of physicians in city
practice.The summer diarrhoea would indeed be comparatively
unimportant were its death-rate as low in the first five years of life
as subsequently.The following statistics show how great a destruction of life this
malady causes even under the surveillance of an energetic health board;
and before this board was established it was much greater, as I had
abundant opportunities to observe.The last annual report of the New
York Board of Health was made in 1875, since which time weekly
bulletins have been {727} issued.The deaths from diarrhoea at all ages
in the three last years in which annual reports were issued were as
follows:

              1873.January       94     43     46
  February      84     34     52
  March         97     40     58
  April        114     47     45
  May           95     61     89
  June         220    144    157
  July        1514   1205   1387
  August       967   1007   1012
  September    424    587    608
  October      213    255    185
  November      87    105     57
  December      53     56     50

Thus, in these three years the aggregate deaths from diarrhoea during
the months from June to October inclusive, in which months the summer
diarrhoea prevails, were 9885, while in the remaining seven months the
number was only 1407.How large a proportion of these deaths in the
warm season occurred in children we may infer from remarks made by the
Health Board in regard to another year.In their annual report for 1870
the board state: "The mortality from the diarrhoeal affections amounted
to 2789, or 33 per cent.of the total deaths; and of these deaths 95
per cent.occurred in children less than five years old, 92 per cent.in children less than two years old, and 67 per cent.Every year the reports of the Health Board furnish
similar statistics, but enough have been given to show how great a
sacrifice of life the summer complaint produces annually in this city.What we observe in New York in reference to this disease is true also,
to a greater or less extent, in other cities of this country and
Europe, so far as we have reports.Not in every city is there the same
proportionate mortality from this cause as in New York, but the
frequency of the summer diarrhoea and the mortality which attends it
render it an important disease in, I believe, most cities of both
continents.In country towns, whether in villages or farm-houses, this
disease is comparatively unimportant, inasmuch as few cases occur in
them, and the few that do occur are of mild type, and consequently much
less fatal than in the cities.The comparative immunity of the rural districts has an important
relation, as we will see, to the hygienic management of these cases.ETIOLOGY.--In the causation of this disease two distinct factors are
recognized--the one atmospheric, the other dietetic.The prevalence and severity of the summer diarrhoea correspond closely
with the degree of atmospheric heat, as may be inferred from the
foregoing statistics.In New York this disease begins in the month of
May--earlier in some years than in others--in a few scattered cases,
commonly of a mild type.Cases become more and more numerous and severe
as the weather grows warmer until July and August, when the diarrhoea
attains its maximum prevalence and severity.In these two months it is
by far the most frequent and fatal of all the diseases in cities.In
the middle of September new patients begin to be less common, and in
the latter part of this month and subsequently new cases do not occur,
unless under unusual circumstances which favor the development of this
malady.In New York a considerable number of deaths {728} of infants
occur from the diarrhoea in October.October is not a hot month in our
latitude--its average temperature is lower than that of May--and yet
the mortality from this disease is considerably larger in the former
than in the latter month.This fact, which seems to show that the
prevalence of the summer diarrhoea does not correspond with the degree
of atmospheric heat, is readily explained.The mortality in October,
and indeed in the latter part of September, is not that of new cases,
but is mainly of infants, as I have observed every year, who contract
the disease in July or August or earlier, and linger in a state of
emaciation and increasing weakness till they finally succumb, some even
in cool weather.The fact is therefore undisputed, and is universally admitted, that the
summer season, stated in a general way, is the cause of this
annually-recurring diarrhoeal epidemic, but it is not so easy to
determine what are the exact causative conditions or agents which the
summer weather brings into activity.That atmospheric heat does not in
itself cause the diarrhoea is evident from the fact that in the rural
districts there is the same intensity of heat as in the cities, and yet
the summer complaint does not occur.The cause must be looked for in
that state of the atmosphere engendered by heat where unsanitary
conditions exist, as in large cities.Moreover, observations show that
the noxious effluvia with which the air becomes polluted under such
circumstances constitute or contain the morbific agent.Thus, in one of
the institutions of this city a few years since, on May 10, which
happened to be an unusually warm day for this month, an offensive odor
was noticed in the wards, which was traced to a large manure-heap that
was being upturned in an adjacent garden.On this day four young
children were severely attacked by diarrhoea, and one died.Many other
examples might be cited showing how the foul air of the city during the
hot months, when animal and vegetable decomposition is most active,
causes diarrhoea.Several years since, while serving as sanitary
inspector for the Citizens' Association in one of the city districts,
my attention was particularly called to one of the streets, in which a
house-to-house visitation disclosed the fact that nearly every infant
between two avenues had the diarrhoea, and usually in a severe form,
not a few dying.This street was compactly built with wooden
tenement-houses on each side, and contained a dense population, mainly
foreign, poor, ignorant, and filthy in their habits.It had no sewer,
and the refuse of the kitchens and bed-chambers was thrown into the
street, where it accumulated in heaps.Water trickled down over the
sidewalks from the houses into the gutters or was thrown out as slops,
so that it kept up a constant moisture of the refuse matter which
covered the street, and promoted the decay of the animal and vegetable
substances which it contained.The air in the domicils and street under
such conditions of impurity was necessarily foul in the extreme, and
stifling during the hot days and nights of July and August; and it was
evidently the important factor in producing the numerous and severe
diarrhoeal cases which were in these domicils.In another locality, occupied by tripe-dealers and a low class of
butchers who carried on fat- and bone-boiling at night, the air was so
foul after dark that the peculiar impurity which tainted it could be
distinctly noticed in the mouth for a considerable time after a night
visit.In the street where {729} these nuisances existed and in
adjacent streets the summer diarrhoea was very prevalent and
destructive to human life.Murchison states that twenty out of
twenty-five boys were affected with purging and vomiting from inhaling
the effluvia from the contents of an old drain near their school-room.Physicians are familiar with a similar fact showing this purgative
effect of impure air--that the atmosphere of a dissecting-room often
causes diarrhoea in those otherwise healthy.The exact nature of the deleterious agent or agents in foul air which
cause the diarrhoea, whether they be gases or organisms, has not been
fully determined; but at a recent meeting of the Berliner Med.Gesellschaft, A. Baginsky made a report on the bacilli of cholera
infantum, which he states he has found both in the dejections and in
the intestinal mucous membrane in the bodies of those who have perished
with this disease.In the stools, along with numerous other organisms,
Baginsky states that he found masses of zoogloea, and the same
organisms he detected on the surface of the small intestines, and could
trace their wanderings as far as the submucous tissue.[1] But it is
evidently very difficult to determine whether such organisms sustain a
causative relation to diarrhoea or spring into existence in consequence
of the foul secretions and decomposing fecal matters which are present.The impurities in the air of a large city are very numerous.Among
those of a gaseous nature are sulphurous acid, sulphuric acid,
sulphuretted hydrogen; various gases of the carbon group, as carbonic
acid, carburetted hydrogen, and carbonic oxide; gases of the nitrogen
group, as the acetate, sulphide, and carbonate of ammonium, nitrous and
nitric acids; and at times compounds of phosphorus and chlorine
(Parkes).A theory deserving consideration is that certain gaseous
impurities found in the air form purgative combinations.D. F. Lincoln,
in his interesting paper on the atmosphere in the _Cyclopaedia of
Medicine_, writes in regard to sulphuretted hydrogen: "When in the air,
freely exposed to the contact of oxygen, it becomes sulphuric acid.Sulphide of ammonium in the same circumstances becomes a sulphate,
which, encountering common salt (chloride of sodium), produces sulphate
of sodium and chloride of ammonium.The sulphates form a characteristic
ingredient of the air in manufacturing districts."The sulphates, we
know, are for the most part purgatives, but whether they or other
chemical agents exist in the respired air in sufficient quantity to
disturb the action of the intestines, even where atmospheric impurities
are most abundant, is problematical and uncertain.Again, the solid impurities in the air of a large city are very
numerous, as any one may observe by viewing a sunbeam in a darkened
room, which is made visible by the numerous particles floating in it.These particles consist largely of organic matter, which sometimes has
been carried a long distance by the wind.The remarkable statement has
been made that in the air of Berlin organic forms have been found of
African production.Ehrenberg discovered fragments of insects of
various kinds--rhizopods, tardigrades, polygastrica, etc.--which,
existing in considerable quantity and inhaled in hot weather, when
decomposition and fermentation are most active, may be deleterious to
the system.Monads, bacteria, vibriones, amorphous dust containing
spores which {730} retain their vitality for months, are among the
substances found in the air of cities.The well-known hazy appearance
of the atmosphere resting over a large city like New York when viewed
from a distance is due to the gaseous and solid impurities with which
the air is so abundantly supplied--impurities which assume importance
in pathological studies, since minute organisms are now believed to
cause so many diseases the etiology of which has heretofore been
obscure.With our present knowledge we must be content with the general
statement that impure air is one of the two important factors which
cause summer diarrhoea, without being able to state positively which of
the elements in the air are most instrumental in causing this result.But the theory is plausible that minute organisms rather than chemical
products are the chief cause.Henoch of Berlin, writing upon this
subject, calls attention to the disease known as intestinal mycosis,
its prominent symptom being a severe diarrhoea produced by eating
diseased meat containing a fungus.He believes that "a portion of the
fungus not destroyed by the gastric juice settles upon different parts
of the intestine, and there produces its effects;" and he adds, "At
present, however, we can regard the mykotic theory of cholera infantum
only as a very probable hypothesis.There is no doubt that high
atmospheric temperature increases the tendency to fermentation
dyspepsias which is present in imperfectly-nourished children at all
seasons, and causes them to appear not only epidemically, but also in
an extremely acute form which is not frequent under ordinary
circumstances.This would lead to the conclusion that, in addition to
the heat, infectious germs are present, which, being developed in great
masses by the former, enter the stomach with the food."The fungus
theory of the causative relation of atmospheric heat to the diarrhoea
of the summer season as thus explained by Henoch commands the readier
assent since it comports with the well-known facts relating to the
etiology of the summer complaint.This disease, as we have seen, is
most prevalent and fatal under precisely those conditions of dense
population, filthy domicils and streets, and atmospheric heat which are
favorable for the development of low organisms.In those portions of our cities which are occupied by the poor, more
than anywhere else, those conditions prevail which render the
atmosphere deleterious.One accustomed to the pure air of the country
would scarcely believe how stifling and poisonous the atmosphere
becomes during the hot summer days and close summer nights in and
around the domicils in the poor quarters of the city.Among the causes
of this foul air may be mentioned too dense a population, the occupancy
of small rooms by large families, rigid economy and ceaseless endeavor
to make ends meet, so that in the absorbing interest sanitary
requirements are sadly neglected.Adults of such families, and children
of both sexes as soon as they are old enough, engage in laborious and
often filthy occupations.Many of them seldom bathe, and they often
wear for days the same undergarments, foul with perspiration and dirt.The intemperate, vicious, and indolent, who always abound in the
quarters of the city poor, are notoriously filthy in their habits and
add to the insalubrity by their presence.Children old enough to be in
the streets and adults away at their occupations escape to a great
extent the evil effects of impure air, but the infantile population
always suffer severely.Every physician who has witnessed the summer diarrhoea of infants is
{731} aware of the fact that the mode of feeding has much to do with
its occurrence.A large proportion of those who each summer fall
victims to it would doubtless escape if the feeding were exactly
proper.In New York City facts like the following are of common
occurrence in the practice of all physicians: Infants under the age of
eight months, if bottle-fed, nearly always contract diarrhoea, and
usually of an obstinate character, during the summer months.The
younger the infant, the less able is it to digest any other food than
breast-milk, and the more liable is it therefore to suffer from
diarrhoea if bottle-fed.In the institutions nearly every bottle-fed
infant under the age of four or even six months dies in the hot months
with symptoms of indigestion and intestinal catarrh, while the
wet-nursed of the same ages remain well.Sudden weaning, the sudden
substitution of cow's milk or any artificially-prepared food in place
of breast-milk in hot weather, almost always produces diarrhoea, often
of a severe and fatal nature.Feeding an infant in the hot months with
indigestible and improper food, as fruits with seeds or the ordinary
table-food prepared in such a way that it overtaxes the digestive
function of the infant, causes diarrhoea, and not infrequently that
severe form of it which will be described under the term cholera
infantum.Many obstinate cases of the summer complaint begin to improve
under change of diet, as by the substitution of one kind of milk for
another or the return of the infant to the breast after it has been
temporarily withdrawn from it.It is a common remark in the families of
the city poor that the second summer is the period of greatest danger
to infants.This increased liability of infants to contract diarrhoea
in the second summer is due to the fact that most infants in their
second year are table-fed, while in the first year they are wet-nursed.Such facts, with which all physicians are familiar, show how important
the diet is as a factor in causing the summer complaint.Occasionally, from continued ill-health, the milk of the mother or
wet-nurse does not agree with the nursling.Examined with the
microscope, it is found to contain colostrum.Under such circumstances
if a healthy wet-nurse be employed the diarrhoea ceases.It is very
important that any woman furnishing breast-milk to an infant should
lead a quiet and regular life, with regular meals and sleep.19, 1882, R. B. Gilbert relates
striking cases in which venereal excesses on the part of wet-nurses
were immediately followed by fatal diarrhoea in the infants which they
suckled.One not a resident would scarcely be able to appreciate the difficulty
which is experienced in a large city in obtaining proper diet for young
children, especially those of such an age that they require milk as the
basis of their food.Milk from cows stabled in the city or having a
limited pasturage near the city, and fed upon a mixture of hay with
garden and distillery products, the latter often largely predominating,
is unsuitable.It is deficient in nutritive properties, prone to
fermentation, and from microscopical and chemical examinations which
have been made it appears that it often contains deleterious
ingredients.If milk be obtained from distant farms where pasturage is
fresh and abundant--and in New York City this is the usual source of
the supply--considerable time elapses before it is served to customers,
so that, particularly in the hot months of July and August, it
frequently has begun to undergo {732} lactic-acid fermentation when the
infants receive it.That dispensed to families in the morning is the
milking of the previous morning and evening.The common result of the
use of this milk in midsummer by infants under the age of ten months is
more or less diarrhoea.The ill-success of feeding with cow's milk has led to the preparation
of various kinds of food which the shops contain, but no dietetic
preparation has yet appeared which agrees so well with the digestive
function of the infant as breast-milk, and is at the same time
sufficiently nutritive.In New York City improper diet, unaided by the conditions which hot
weather produces, is a common cause of diarrhoea in young infants, for
we meet with this diarrhoea in infants who are bottle-fed at all
seasons; but when the atmospheric conditions of hot weather and the use
of food unsuitable for the age of the infant are both present and
operative, this diarrhoea so increases in frequency and severity that
it is proper to designate it the summer epidemic of the cities.Several
years since, before the New York Foundling Asylum was established, the
foundlings of New York, more than a thousand annually, were taken to
the almshouse on Blackwell's Island and consigned to the care of the
pauper-women, who were mostly old, infirm, and filthy in their habits
and apparel.Their beds, in which the foundlings were also placed
alongside of them, were seldom clean, not properly aired and washed,
and under the beds were various garments and utensils which these
pauper-women had brought with them as their sole property from their
miserable abodes in the city.With such surroundings, the air which
these infants breathed day and night manifestly contained poisonous
emanations; while their diet was equally improper, for it was prepared
by these women from such milk and farinaceous food as were furnished
the almshouse.When assigned to duty in the almshouse, this service
being at that time a branch of Charity Hospital, I was informed that
all the foundlings died before the age of two months; one only was
pointed out as a curiosity which had been an exception to the rule.The
disease of which they perished was diarrhoea, and this malady in the
summer months was especially severe and rapidly fatal.The unpleasant
experiences in this institution furnished additional evidence, were any
wanting, that foul air and improper diet are the two important factors
in causing the summer diarrhoea of infants.Since that beneficial
charity, the New York Foundling Asylum, in East Sixty-eighth street,
came into existence, providing pure air and, for a considerable
proportion of the foundlings, breast-milk, many of these waifs have
been rescued from death.I have already stated that this disease occurs, with an occasional
exception, under the age of two and a half years.The following table
embraces all the cases that came to one of the city dispensaries during
my service between the months of May and October, inclusive:

       Age.5 months or under         58
   5 months to 12 months    212
  12 months to 18 months    174
  18 months to 24 months     93
  24 months to 36 months     36
                            ---
        Total               573

After the third year the liability to the summer complaint so rapidly
{733} diminishes that comparatively few are affected by it.It is seen
from the above statistics that by far the largest number of cases occur
during the period of first dentition; hence the prevalent opinion among
families that dentition causes the diarrhoea.It is the common belief
among the poor of New York that diarrhoea occurring during dentition is
conservative, and should not be checked.They believe that an infant
cutting its teeth suffers less, and may be saved from serious illness,
if it have frequent stools.Every summer I see infants reduced to a
state of imminent danger through the continuance of diarrhoea during
several weeks, nothing having been done to check it in consequence of
this absurd belief.The progressive loss of flesh and strength and
wasting of the features do not excite alarm, under the blinding
influence of this theory, till the diarrhoea has continued so long and
become so severe that it is with difficulty controlled, and the patient
is in a state of real danger when the physician is first summoned.The
following statistics, which comprise cases occurring during my service
in one of the city dispensaries, show the preponderance of cases during
the age when dental evolution is occurring:

                                              Cases.No teeth and no marked turgescence of gums    47
  Cutting incisors                             106
     "    anterior molars                       41
     "    canines                               40
     "    last molars                           20
  All the teeth cut                             28
                                               ---
        Total                                  282

It so happens that the period of dental evolution corresponds with that
of the most rapid development and the greatest functional activity of
the gastric and intestinal follicles, and the predisposition which
exists to diarrhoeal maladies at this age must be attributed to this
cause rather than to dentition.SYMPTOMS.--The summer diarrhoea of infants commonly begins gradually
with languor, fretfulness, and slight febrile movement.The diarrhoea
at first usually attracts little attention from its mildness.The
stools, while they are thinner than natural, vary in appearance, being
yellow, brown, or green.Infants with milk diet are apt to pass green
and acid stools containing particles of undigested casein.The tongue
in the commencement of the attack is moist and covered with a slight
fur.At a more advanced stage it may be moist, but is often dry, and in
dangerous forms of the malady, accompanied by prostration, the buccal
surface is red and the gums more or less swollen and sometimes
ulcerated.It may commence simultaneously with the
diarrhoea, especially when food that is unusually indigestible and
irritating to the stomach has been given, but more frequently this
symptom does not appear until the diarrhoea has continued a few days.I
preserved memoranda of the date when vomiting began in the cases
treated in two consecutive summers, and found that ordinarily it was
toward the close of the first week.When it is an early and prominent
symptom it appears to be due to the presence in the stomach of
imperfectly digested or fermented and acid food, which, when ejected,
gives a decidedly acid reaction with appropriate tests.It contains
coagulated casein and undigested particles of whatever food has been
given.In many patients the progressive loss of flesh and {734}
strength is largely due to the indigestion and vomiting by which the
food, which is so much required for proper nourishment, is lost.Emesis occurring at a late stage of the summer complaint is often due
to commencing spurious hydrocephalus, which is not an infrequent
complication, as we will see, of protracted cases.Perhaps when a late
symptom it may sometimes have an uraemic origin, for the urine is
usually quite scanty in advanced cases.It seems probable, however,
that deleterious effects from non-elimination of urea are to a
considerable extent prevented by the diarrhoea.The fecal evacuations may remain nearly uniform in appearance during
the disease, but in many patients they vary in color and consistence at
different periods.In the same case they may be brown and offensive at
one time, green at another, and again they may contain masses of a
putty-like appearance, the partly-digested casein or altered epithelial
cells.The stools sometimes consist largely of mucus, with or without
occasional streaks of blood, indicating the predominance of
inflammation in the colon.This is the mucous diarrhoea of Barrier.The
stools are sometimes yellow when passed, but become green on exposure
to the air from chemical reaction due to admixture with the urine.The character of the alvine discharges is interesting.In addition to
undigested casein I have found epithelial cells, single or in clusters
(sometimes regularly arranged as if detached in mass from the villi),
fibres of meat, crystalline formations, mucus, and occasionally blood,
as stated above.In one instance I observed an appearance resembling
three or four crypts of Lieberkuhn united, probably thrown off by
ulceration.If the stools are green, <DW52> masses of various sizes,
but mostly small, are also seen under the microscope.The pulse is accelerated according to the severity of the attack.The
heat of the surface is at first apt to be increased, though but
slightly in ordinary cases; but when the vital powers begin to fail
from the continuance of the diarrhoea the warmth of the surface
diminishes.In advanced cases approaching a fatal termination the face
and extremities are pallid and cool, and the pulse gradually becomes
more frequent and feeble.The skin is usually dry, and, as already
stated, the urinary secretion diminished.In severe cases attended by
frequent alvine discharges the infant does not pass urine oftener than
once or twice daily.The imperfect action of the skin and kidneys is
noteworthy.Protracted cases of the summer complaint are apt to be complicated by
two cutaneous eruptions--erythema extending over the perineum and
frequently as far as the thighs and lower part of the abdomen, due to
the acid and irritating character of the stools; and boils upon the
forehead and scalp.The latter sometimes extend to the pericranium, and
in case of recovery leave permanent cicatrices.This furuncular
affection of the scalp has seemed to me useful in consequence of the
external irritation which it causes, since it occurs at a time when, on
account of the feeble heart's action and languid circulation, passive
congestion of the vessels of the brain and meninges is liable to be
present.Patients who are weak and wasted in consequence of protracted
diarrhoea, remaining almost constantly in the recumbent position, often
have an occasional dry cough which continues till the close of life.It
is due to hypostatic congestion in the lungs, usually limited to the
posterior and {735} inferior portions of the lobes, extending but a
little way into the lungs.It is the result of prolonged recumbency
with feeble heart's action and feeble pulmonary circulation.Infants
reduced by chronic diseases, lying day after day in their cribs with
little movement of their bodies, are very liable to this passive
congestion of depending portions of their lungs, toward which the blood
gravitates, and into which but little air enters in consequence of
their distance and position and the feeble respirations.The hyperaemia
which results is of a passive character, a venous congestion, and the
affected lobules have a dusky-red color.This congestion, continuing,
soon results in pneumonitis of the catarrhal form, subacute and of a
low grade, for pulmonary lobules in which the blood remains stagnant
soon exhibit augmented cell-proliferation, perhaps from the irritating
effects of the elements of the blood now withdrawn from the
circulation.I have made or procured a considerable number of microscopic
examinations in these cases of hypostatic pneumonia, and the
solidification of the pulmonary lobules has been found to be due to the
exaggerated development of the epithelial cells in the alveoli,
together with venous congestion.The affected lobules, whether in the
stage of hypostatic congestion or the more advanced stage of hypostatic
pneumonitis, when examined at the autopsy, were somewhat softer than in
health, of dark color, and many of the lobules could be inflated by
strong force of the breath; but in protracted cases the alveoli in
central parts of the inflamed area resisted insufflation.The lung in
hypostatic pneumonia, even when it is inflated, still feels firmer
between the fingers than normal lung.Hypostatic pneumonia is so common in hospitals for infants that some
physicians whose observations have been chiefly in such institutions
have almost ignored other forms of pulmonary inflammation.Billard,
many years ago, wrote: "... The pneumonia of young children is
evidently the result of stagnation of blood in their lungs.Under these
circumstances the blood may be regarded as a kind of foreign body."Of
all the chronic and exhausting diseases of infancy, no one has,
according to my observations, been so frequently complicated by
hypostatic pneumonia as the disease which we are considering, although
it does not usually give rise to any more prominent symptom than an
occasional cough.Limited to a small and almost immovable part of the
lung, it does not ordinarily accelerate respiration or render it
painful, and the cough is also apparently painless.When progressive loss of flesh and strength has continued several
weeks, and the patient is much exhausted, another complication is apt
to occur, known as spurious hydrocephalus or the hydrocephaloid
disease, the anatomical characters of which will be described in the
proper place.The commencement of spurious hydrocephalus is announced
by gradually increasing drowsiness, perhaps preceded by a period of
unusual fretfulness.Vomiting and rolling the head are occasional early
symptoms of this complication.As the drowsiness increases the pupils
become less sensitive to light than in their normal state, and are
usually contracted.When the drowsiness becomes profound and constant,
the pupils remain contracted as in sound sleep or in opium narcotism.The functional activity of the organs is now also diminished, the
vomiting ceases, the stools become less frequent, the buccal surface
dry, and the urine more {736} scanty, while the pulse is more frequent
and feeble.Spurious hydrocephalus either continues till death, or by
stimulation the patient may emerge from it.Although the summer complaint in its commencement may be promptly
arrested by proper hygienic and medicinal treatment, if it continue a
few weeks the anatomical changes which occur are such that recovery, if
it take place, is necessarily slow and gradual.Improvement is shown by
better digestion, fewer stools and of better appearance, less frequent
vomiting, a more cheerful countenance, and the absence of symptoms
which indicate a complication.Many recover after days of anxious
watching and perhaps after many fluctuations.Death may occur early from a sudden aggravation of symptoms and rapid
sinking, or the attack may be so violent from the first that the infant
quickly succumbs; but more frequently death takes place after a
prolonged sickness.Little by little the patient loses flesh and
strength, till a state of marked emaciation is reached.The eyes and
cheeks are sunken, the bony projections of the face, trunk, and limbs
become prominent, and the skin lies in wrinkles from the wasting.The
altered expression of the face makes the patient look older than the
actual age.The joints in contrast with the wasted extremities seem
enlarged and the fingers and toes elongated.The stools diminish in
frequency from diminished peristaltic and vermicular action, and
vomiting, if previously present, now ceases.A feeble, quick, and
scarcely appreciable pulse, slow respiration, and diminished inflation
of the lungs, sightless and contracted pupils, over which the eyelids
no longer close, announce the near approach of death.The drowsiness
increases and the limbs become cool, while perhaps the head is hot.The
infant no longer has the ability to nurse, or if bottle-fed the food
placed in the mouth flows back or is swallowed with apparent
indifference.So low is its vitality that it lies pallid and almost
motionless for hours or even days before death, and death occurs so
quietly that the moment of its occurrence is scarcely appreciable.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--Since the prominent and essential symptoms of
the disease which we are considering pertain to the digestive
apparatus, it is evident that the lesions which attend and characterize
it are to be found in this part of the system.Lesions elsewhere, so
far as they are appreciable to us, are secondary and not essential.I
have witnessed a large number of autopsies of infants who have perished
from the summer complaint, chiefly in institutions, and they have been
sufficiently marked and uniform to enable us to designate it an
entero-colitis.Several years since I preserved records of the
autopsical appearances in the intestinal catarrh of infants, most of
the cases being of summer diarrhoea.Since then I have each summer witnessed autopsies in the institutions
in cases of this disease, and the lesions observed were the same as in
the eighty-two cases.The question may properly be asked: Can inflammatory hyperaemia of the
intestinal mucous membrane be distinguished from simple congestion if
there be no ulceration and no appreciable thickening of the intestine?It is possible that occasionally I have recorded as inflammatory what
was simply a congestive lesion, but I do not think I have incorporated
a {737} sufficient number of such cases to vitiate the statistics.In a
large proportion of the cases there was evident thickening of the
intestinal mucous membrane or other unequivocal evidence of
inflammation.The following is an analysis of the eighty-two cases:

The duodenum and jejunum presented the appearance of inflammatory
hyperaemia in 12 cases.The hyperaemia was usually in patches of
variable extent or of that form described by the term arborescent.In
51 cases the duodenal and jejunal mucous membrane was pale and without
any other appearance characteristic of catarrh or inflammation.In the
remaining 19 cases the appearance of the duodenum and jejunum was not
recorded, so that it was probably normal.On the other hand, in the
ileum inflammatory lesions were present as a rule.In 49 cases I found
the surface of the ileum distinctly hyperaemic, and in that portion of
it nearest the ileo-caecal valve, including the valve itself, the
inflammation had evidently been the most intense, since in this portion
the hyperaemia and thickening of the mucous membrane were most marked.In 16 cases the surface of the ileum appeared nearly or quite normal;
in 14 hyperaemia in the small intestines in patches, streaks, or
arborescence was recorded, but the records do not state in which
division of the intestines they were observed.Billard, with other observers, has noticed the frequency and intensity
of the inflammatory lesions in entero-colitis in the terminal portion
of the small intestines, and the thickening in many cases of the
ileo-caecal valve, and he asks whether the vomiting which is so common
and often obstinate in this disease may not be sometimes due to
obstruction to the passage of fecal matter at the valve in consequence
of the hyperaemia and swelling, but has not observed any retained fecal
matter above it, such as we find in any part of the colon, or any other
appearance which indicated sufficient obstruction to cause symptoms.Still, it seems not improbable that the reason why the inflammatory
lesions are more pronounced at and immediately above the valve than in
other parts of the small intestine is that the fecal matter, so
commonly acid and irritating in this disease, is somewhat delayed in
its passage downward at this point.Small superficial circular or oval ulcers were observed in the ileum in
4 cases, in 2 of which they were found also in the lower part of the
jejunum.In 1 case the records state that ulcers were in the jejunum,
but do not mention whether they were also in the ileum.In 1 case, in
which there was much thickening of the ileum next to the ileo-caecal
valve, many small granulations had sprouted up from the submucous
connective tissue, so that the mucous surface appeared as if studded
with small warts.Softening of the mucous membrane was also apparent in certain cases.The firmness of its attachment to the parts underneath varied
considerably in different specimens.I was able in cases in which there
was considerable softening to detach readily the mucous membrane with
the nail or handle of the scalpel within so short a period after death
that it was probable that the change of consistence was not cadaveric.In some cases the vessels of the submucous tissue were injected and
this tissue infiltrated.In all the cases except one lesions were present indicating
inflammation {738} of the mucous membrane of the colon.In 39
hyperaemia, thickening, and other signs of inflammation extended over
nearly or quite the entire colon; in 14 the colitis was confined to the
descending portion entirely or almost entirely; in 28 cases the records
state that inflammatory lesions were found in the colon, but their
exact location is not mentioned.In 18 of the autopsies the mucous
membrane of the colon was found ulcerated.Therefore, according to these statistics--and autopsies which I have
witnessed that are not embraced in them disclosed similar
lesions--colitis is present, almost without exception, in cases of
summer diarrhoea, associated with more or less ileitis.The portion of
the colon which presents the most marked inflammatory lesions is that
in and immediately above the sigmoid flexure--that portion, therefore,
in which any fermenting fecal matter has reached its greatest degree of
fermentation, and consequently contains the most irritating elements,
and where, next to the caput coli, it is longest delayed in its passage
downward.The solitary glands of both the large and small intestines and Peyer's
patches undergo hyperplasia.In cases of short duration, and in parts
of the intestine where the inflammatory action has been mild, the
solitary glands present a vascular appearance, like the surrounding
membrane, and are slightly enlarged.The enlargement is most apparent
if the intestine be viewed by transmitted light, when not only are the
glands seen to be swollen, but their central dark points are distinct.If a higher grade of intestinal catarrh or a catarrh more protracted
have occurred, the volume of these follicles is so increased that they
rise above the common level and present a papillary appearance.Peyer's
patches are also distinct and punctate.The enlargement of Peyer's
patches, like that of the solitary glands, is due to hyperplasia, the
elementary cells being largely increased in number.The small ulcers which, as we have seen from the above statistics, are
present in a certain proportion of cases in the mucous membrane of the
colon, and more rarely in that of the small intestine when the
inflammation has been protracted and of a severe type, appear to occur
in the solitary glands and in the mucous membrane surrounding them.While some of these glands in a specimen are simply tumefied, others
are slightly ulcerated, and others still nearly or quite destroyed.The
ulcers are usually from one to three lines in diameter, circular or
oval, with edges slightly raised from infiltration.Rarely, I have seen
minute coagula of blood in one or more ulcers, and I have also observed
ulcers which have evidently been larger and have partially healed.The
ulcers are more frequently found in the descending colon than in other
portions of the intestines.When ulcers are present they commonly occur
in the descending colon, or if occurring elsewhere they are most
abundant in this situation.According to my observations, these ulcers are found chiefly in infants
over the age of six months--during the time, therefore, when there is
greatest functional activity and most rapid development of the solitary
glands.Peyer's patches, though frequently prominent and distinct, have
not been ulcerated in any of the cases observed by me.The appendix vermiformis participates in the catarrh when it occurs in
the caput coli, its mucous membrane being hyperaemic and thickened.In
{739} certain rare cases the inflammation is so intense that a thin
film of fibrin is exuded in places upon the surface of the colon.It is
apt to be overlooked or to be washed away in the examination.The
rectum usually presents no inflammatory lesions, or but slight lesions
in comparison with those in the colon.It usually remains of the normal
pale color, or but slightly vascular even when there is almost general
colitis.Hence the infrequency of tenesmus.As might be expected from the nature of the disease, the secretion of
mucus from the intestinal surface is augmented.It is often seen
forming a layer upon the intestinal surface, and it appears in the
stools mixed with epithelial cells and sometimes with blood and pus.The mesenteric glands in cases which have run the most protracted
course and end fatally are found more or less enlarged from
hyperplasia.They are frequently as large as a pea or larger, and of a
light color, the color being due not only to the hyperplasia, but in
part to the anaemia.Occasionally, when patients have been much reduced
from the long continuance of the diarrhoea, and are in a state of
marked cachexia at death, we find certain of these glands caseous.The condition of the stomach is interesting, since indigestion and
vomiting are so commonly present.I have records of its appearance in
59 cases, in 42 of which it seemed normal, having the usual pale color
and exhibiting only such changes as occur in the cadaver.In the
remaining 17 cases the stomach was more or less hyperaemic, and in 3 of
them points of ulceration were observed in the mucous membrane.All physicians familiar with this disease have remarked the frequency
of stomatitis.In protracted and grave cases it is a common
complication.The buccal surface in these cases is more vascular than
natural, and if the vital powers are much reduced superficial
ulcerations are not infrequent, oftener upon the gums than elsewhere.The gums are apt to be spongy, more or less swollen, bleeding readily
when rubbed or pressed upon.Thrush is a common complication of the
summer complaint in infants under the age of three or four months, but
is infrequent in older infants.Occurring in those over the age of six
or eight months, it has an unfavorable prognostic significance,
indicating a form of summer diarrhoea which commonly eventuates in
death.The belief has long been prevalent in the past that the liver is also
in fault.The green color of the stools was supposed to be due to
vitiated bile.But usually in the post-mortem examinations which I have
made I have found that the green coloration of the fecal matter did not
appear at the point where the bile enters the intestines, but at some
point below the ductus communis choledochus in the jejunum or ileum.The green tinge, at first slight, becomes more and more distinct on
tracing it downward in the intestine.It appears to be due to admixture
of the intestinal secretions with the fecal matter.I have notes of the appearance and state of the liver in 32 fatal
cases.Nothing could be seen in these examinations which indicated any
anatomical change in this organ that could be attributed to the
diarrhoeal malady.The size and weight of the liver varied considerably
in infants of the same age, but probably there was no greater
difference than usually obtains among glandular organs in a state of
health.The following was the weight of this organ in 20 cases: {740}

    Age.4 weeks   5     ounces.| 10 months   6-3/4 ounces.2 months  3-1/2   "      | 13   "      6       "
  2   "     3-1/2   "      | 14   "      9       "
  4   "     5       "      | 15   "      6       "
  5   "     6-1/2   "      | 15   "      7-1/2   "
  5   "     9       "      | 15   "      9-1/2   "
  7   "     4-1/2   "      | 16   "      6       "
  7   "     6       "      | 19   "      4-1/2   "
  7   "     6-1/4   "      | 20   "      9-1/4   "
  9   "     8       "      | 23   "     15       "

In none of these cases did the size, weight, or appearance of this
organ seem to be different from that in health or in other diseases,
except in one in which fatty degeneration had occurred, but this was
probably due to tuberculosis, which was also present.In most of these
cases the liver was examined microscopically, and the only noteworthy
appearance observed was the variable amount of oil-globules in the
hepatic cells.In some specimens the oil-globules were in excess, in
others deficient, and in others still they were more abundant in one
part of the organ than in another.Little importance was attached to
these differences in the quantity of oily matter.Hypostatic congestion of the posterior portions of the lungs, ending if
it continue in a form of subacute catarrhal pneumonia and giving rise
to an occasional painless cough, has been described in the preceding
pages.The character of the cough in connection with the wasting might
excite suspicions of the presence of tubercles in the lungs; but
tubercles are rare in this disease, and when present I should suspect a
strong hereditary predisposition.They occurred in only 1 of the 82
cases.The state of the encephalon in those patients in whom spurious
hydrocephalus occurs is interesting.In protracted cases of the
diarrhoea the brain wastes like the body and limbs.In the young
infant, in whom the cranial bones are still ununited, the occipital and
sometimes the frontal bones become depressed and overlapped by the
parietal, the depression being of course proportionate to the
diminution in size of the encephalon.In older children, with the cranial bones consolidated, serous effusion
occurs according to the degree of waste, thus preserving the size of
the encephalon.The effusion is chiefly external to the brain, lying
over the convolutions from the base to the vertex.Its quantity varies
from one or two drachms to an ounce or more.Along with this serous
effusion, and antedating it, passive congestion of the cerebral veins
and sinuses is also present.This congestion is the obvious and
necessary result of the feebleness of the heart's action and the loss
of brain substance.DIAGNOSIS.--The occurrence and continuance of diarrhoea in the warm
months, without any apparent cause except the agencies which hot
weather produces, indicate this disease.The exciting cause of the
attack may be the use of some indigestible and irritating substance,
dietetic or medicinal, as fruits with their seeds or a purgative
medicine; but if it continue after the immediate effects of the agent
have passed off, it is proper to attribute the diarrhoea to the summer
season.In the adult abdominal tenderness is an important diagnostic symptom of
intestinal catarrh, but in the infant this symptom is lacking or is not
in general appreciable, so that it does not aid in diagnosis.When the
{741} diagnosis of the disease is established, the symptoms do not
usually indicate what part of the intestinal surface is chiefly
involved, but it may be assumed that it is the lower part of the ileum
and the colon.The presence of mucus or of mucus tinged with blood in
the stools shows the predominance of colitis.PROGNOSIS.--Although this disease every summer largely increases the
death-rate of young children, most cases can be cured if the proper
hygienic and medicinal measures be early applied.It is obvious, from
what has been stated in the foregoing pages, that cholera infantum is
the form of this malady which involves greatest danger.Except in such
cases there is sufficient forewarning of a fatal result, for if death
occur it is after a lingering sickness, with fluctuations and gradual
loss of flesh and strength.Patients often recover from a state of
great prostration and emaciation, provided that no fatal complications
arise.The eyes may be sunken, the skin lie in folds from the wasting,
the strength may be so exhausted that any other than the recumbent
position is impossible, and yet the patient may recover by removal to
the country, by change of weather, or by the use of better diet and
remedies.Therefore an absolutely unfavorable prognosis should not be
made except in cases that are complicated or that border on collapse.The most dangerous symptoms, except those which indicate commencing or
actual collapse, arise from the state of the brain.Rolling the head,
squinting, feeble action or permanent contraction of the pupils,
spasmodic or irregular movements of the limbs, indicate the near
approach of death, as do also coldness of face and extremities and
inability to swallow.It is obvious also that in making the prognosis
in ordinary cases we should consider the age of the patient, the state
of the weather, the time in the summer, whether in the beginning or
near its close, and the surroundings, especially in reference to the
impurity of the air, as well as the patient's condition.Cholera Infantum, or Choleriform Diarrhoea.This is the most severe form of the summer complaint.It receives the
name which designates it from the violence of its symptoms, which
closely resemble those of Asiatic cholera.It is, however, quite
distinct from that disease.It is characterized by frequent stools,
vomiting, great elevation of temperature, and rapid and great
emaciation and loss of strength.It commonly occurs under the age of
two years.It sometimes begins abruptly, the previous health having
been good; in other cases it is preceded by the ordinary form of summer
diarrhoea.The stools have been thinner than natural and somewhat more
frequent, but not such as to excite alarm, when suddenly they become
more frequent and watery, and the parents are surprised and frightened
by the rapid sinking and real danger of the infant.The first evacuations, unless there have been previous diarrhoea, may
contain fecal matter, but subsequently they are so thin that they soak
into the diaper like urine, and in some cases they scarcely produce
more of a stain than does this secretion.Their odor is peculiar--not
fecal, but musty and offensive, and occasionally almost odorless.Commencing simultaneously with the watery evacuations or soon after is
another {742} symptom, irritability of the stomach, which increases
greatly the prostration and danger.Whatever drinks are swallowed by
the infant are rejected immediately or after a few moments, or retching
may occur without vomiting.The appetite is lost and the thirst is
intense.Cold water is taken with avidity, and if the infant nurse it
eagerly seizes the breast in order to relieve the thirst.The tongue is
moist at first, and clean or covered with a light fur, pulse
accelerated, respiration either natural or somewhat increased in
frequency, and the surface warm, but the temperature is speedily
reduced in severe cases.The internal temperature or that of the blood
is always very high.In ordinary cases of cholera infantum the
thermometer introduced into the rectum rises to or above 105 degrees,
and I have seen it indicate 107 degrees.Although the infant may be
restless at first, it does not appear to have any abdominal pain or
tenderness.The restlessness is apparently due to thirst or to that
unpleasant sensation which the sick feel when the vital powers are
rapidly reduced.The urine is scanty in proportion to the gravity of
the attack, as it ordinarily is when the stools are frequent and
watery.The emaciation and loss of strength are more rapid than in any other
disease which I can recall to mind, unless in Asiatic cholera.In a few
hours the parents scarcely recognize in the changed and melancholy
aspect of the infant any resemblance to the features which it exhibited
a day or two before.The eyes are sunken, the eyelids and lips are
permanently open from the feeble contractile power of the muscles which
close them, while the loss of the fluids from the tissues and the
emaciation are such that the bony angles become more prominent and the
skin in places lies in folds.As the disease approaches a fatal termination, which often occurs in
two or three days, the infant remains quiet, not disturbed even by the
flies which alight upon its face.The limbs and face become cool, the
eyes bleared, pupils contracted, and the urine scanty or suppressed.In
some instances, when the patient is near death, the respiration becomes
accelerated, either from the effect of the disease upon the respiratory
centres or from pulmonary congestion resulting from the feeble
circulation.As the vital powers fail the pulse becomes progressively
more feeble, the surface has a clammy coldness, the contracted pupils
no longer respond to light, and the stupor deepens, from which it is
impossible to arouse the infant.In the most favorable cases cholera infantum is checked before the
occurrence of these grave symptoms, and often in cases which are
ultimately fatal there is not such a speedy termination of the malady
as is indicated in the above description.The choleriform diarrhoea
abates and the case becomes one of ordinary summer complaint.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--Rilliet and Barthez, who of foreign writers
treat of cholera infantum at greatest length, describe it under the
name of gastro-intestinal choleriform catarrh."The perusal," they
remark, "of anatomico-pathological descriptions, and especially the
study of the facts, show that the gastro-intestinal tube in subjects
who succumb to this disease may be in four different states: (_a_)
either the stomach is softened without any lesion of the digestive
tube; (_b_) or the stomach is softened at the same time that the mucous
membrane of the intestine, and especially its follicular apparatus, is
diseased; (_c_) or the stomach is healthy, {743} while the follicular
apparatus or the mucous membrane is diseased; (_d_) or, finally, the
gastro-intestinal tube is not the seat of any lesion appreciable to our
senses in the present state of our knowledge, or it presents lesions so
insignificant that they are not sufficient to explain the gravity of
the symptoms."So far, the disease resembles all the catarrhs, but what is special is
the abundance of serous secretion and the disturbance of the great
sympathetic nerve."The serous secretion, which appears to be produced by a perspiration
(analogous to that of the respiratory passages and of the skin) rather
than by a follicular secretion, shows, perhaps, that the elimination of
substances is effected by other organs than the follicles; perhaps,
also, we ought to see a proof that the materials to eliminate are not
the same as in simple catarrh.Upon all these points we are constrained
to remain in doubt.We content ourselves with pointing out the
fact."[2]

[Footnote 2: _Maladies des Enfants_.]On the 1st of August, 1861, I made the autopsy of an infant sixteen
months old who died of cholera infantum with a sickness of less than
one day.Nothing
unusual was observed in the brain, unless perhaps a little more than
the ordinary injection of vessels at the vertex.No marked anatomical
change was observed in the stomach and intestines, except enlargement
of the patches of Peyer as well as of the solitary and mesenteric
glands.In this and the following cases there was
apparently slight softening of the intestinal mucous membrane, but
whether it was pathological or cadaveric was uncertain, as the weather
was very warm.Examined by the microscope, it
was found to contain about the normal number of oil-globules.The second case was that of an infant seven months old, wet-nursed, who
died July 26, 1862, after a sickness also of about one day.He was
previously emaciated, but without any marked ailment.The post-mortem
examination was made on the 28th.The brain was somewhat softer than
natural, but otherwise healthy.There was no abnormal vascularity of
the membranes of the brain, and no serous effusion within the cranium.The mucous membrane of the intestines had nearly the normal color
throughout, but it seemed somewhat thickened and softened; the solitary
glands of the colon were prominent.The patches of Peyer were not
distinct.In the New York Protestant Episcopal Orphan Asylum an infant twenty
months old, previously healthy, was seized with cholera infantum on the
25th of June, 1864.The alvine evacuations, as is usual with this
disease, were frequent and watery, and attended by obstinate vomiting.Death occurred in slight spasms in thirty-six hours.The exciting cause
was probably the use of a few currants which were eaten in a cake the
day before, some of which fruit was contained in the first evacuations.The only pathological changes which were
observed in the stomach and intestines were slightly vascular patches
in the small intestines and an unusual prominence of the solitary
glands in the colon.The glands resembled small beads imbedded in the
mucous membrane.The lungs in the above cases were healthy, excepting
hypostatic congestion.{744} Since the date of these autopsies I have made others in cases
which terminated fatally after a brief duration, and have uniformly
found similar lesions--namely, the gastro-intestinal surface either
without vascularity or scantily vascular in streaks or patches,
sometimes presenting a whitish or soggy appearance and somewhat
softened, while the solitary glands were enlarged so as to be prominent
upon the surface.In cases which continue longer evident inflammatory
lesions soon appear which are identical with those which have already
been described in our remarks on the ordinary form of the summer
diarrhoea.During my term of service in the New York Foundling Asylum in the
summer of 1884, an infant died after a brief illness with all the
symptoms of cholera infantum, and the intestines were sent to William
H. Welch, now of Johns Hopkins Hospital, for microscopic examination.His report was as follows: "I found undoubted evidence of acute
inflammation.There was an increased number of small, round cells
(leucocytes) in the mucous and submucous coats.This accumulation of
new cells was most abundant in and around the solitary follicles, which
were greatly swollen.Clumps of lymphoid cells were found extending
even a little into the muscular coat.The epithelial lining of the
intestine was not demonstrable, but this is usually the case with
post-mortem specimens of human intestine, and justifies no inferences
as to pathological changes.The glands of Lieberkuhn were rich in the
so-called goblet-cells, and some of the glands were distended with
mucus and desquamated epithelium, so as to present sometimes the
appearance of little cysts.This was observed especially in the
neighborhood of the solitary follicles.The blood-vessels, especially
the veins of the submucous coat, were abnormally distended with blood.I searched for micro-organisms, and found them in abundance upon the
free surface of the intestine in the mucous accumulations there, and
also in the mouths of the glands of Lieberkuhn.Both rod-shaped and
small round bacteria were found.I attach no especial importance to
finding bacteria upon the surface of the intestine.The general result
of the examination is to confirm the view that cholera infantum is
characterized by an acute intestinal inflammation."NATURE.--Cholera infantum appears from its symptoms and lesions to be
the most severe form of intestinal catarrh to which infants are liable.The alvine discharges, to which the rapid prostration is largely due,
probably consist in part of intestinal secretions and in part of serum
which has transuded from the capillaries of the intestines.That the
intestinal mucous membrane sometimes presents a pale appearance at the
autopsy of an infant who, previously well, has died of cholera infantum
after a sickness of twenty-four or forty-eight hours, is perhaps due to
the great amount of liquid secretion and transudation in which the
inflamed surface is bathed.Moreover, it is, I believe, a recognized
fact that the hyperaemia of an acutely-inflamed surface when of short
duration frequently disappears in the cadaver, as that of scarlet fever
and erysipelas.The early hyperplasia of the solitary and mesenteric
glands, and the hyperaemia and thickening of the surface of the ileum
and colon in those who have survived a few days, indicate the
inflammatory character of the malady.The opinion has been expressed by certain observers that cholera {745}
infantum is identical with thermic fever or sunstroke.There is indeed
a resemblance to thermic fever as regards certain important symptoms.In cholera infantum the temperature is from 105 degrees to 108 degrees;
in sunstroke it is also very high, often running above 108 degrees.Great heat of head, contracted pupils, thin fecal evacuations,
embarrassed respiration, scanty urine, and cerebral symptoms are common
toward the close of cholera infantum, and they are the prominent
symptoms in sunstroke.Nevertheless, I cannot accept the theory which
regards these maladies as identical, and which removes cholera infantum
from the list of intestinal diseases.In cholera infantum the
gastro-intestinal symptoms always take the precedence, and are, except
in advanced cases, always more prominent than other symptoms.It does
not commence as by a stroke like coup de soleil, but it comes on more
gradually, though rapidly, and it often supervenes upon a diarrhoea or
some error of diet.In the commencement of cholera infantum the infant
is not apt to be drowsy, and it is often wide awake and restless from
the thirst.Contrast this with the alarming stupor of sunstroke.Sunstroke only occurs during the hours of excessive heat, but cholera
infantum may occur at any hour or in any day during the hot weather,
provided that there be sufficient dietetic cause.Again, intestinal
inflammation is not common in sunstroke, while it is the common or, as
I believe, the essential lesion of cholera infantum.These facts show,
in my opinion, that the two maladies are essentially and entirely
distinct.Nevertheless, cases of apparent sunstroke sometimes occur in
the infant, and if the bowels are at the same time relaxed the disease
is apt to be regarded as cholera infantum, and if fatal is usually
reported as such to the health authorities.Cases of this kind I have
occasionally observed or they have been reported to me, although they
are not common.With the exception of the organs of digestion no uniform lesions are
observed in any of the viscera in cholera infantum, except such as are
due to change in the quantity and fluidity of the blood and its
circulation.Writers describe an anaemic appearance of the thoracic and
abdominal viscera, and occasionally passive congestion of the cerebral
vessels.The cerebral symptoms often present toward the close of life
in unfavorable cases of cholera infantum are often due to spurious
hydrocephalus, which we have described above; but as the urinary
secretion is scanty or suppressed, cerebral symptoms may in certain
cases be due to uraemia.DIAGNOSIS.--This form of the summer diarrhoea is diagnosticated by the
symptoms, and especially by the frequency and character of the stools.The stools have already been described as frequent, often passed with
considerable force, deficient in fecal matter, and thin, so as to soak
into the diaper almost like urine.The vomiting, thirst, rapid sinking,
and emaciation serve to distinguish cholera infantum from other
diarrhoeal maladies.When Asiatic cholera is prevalent the differential diagnosis between
the two is difficult if not impossible.PROGNOSIS.--Cholera infantum is one of those diseases in regard to
which physicians often injure their reputation by not giving sufficient
notice of the danger, or even by expressing a favorable opinion when
the case soon after ends fatally.A favorable prognosis should seldom
be expressed without qualification.If the urgent symptoms be relieved,
{746} still the disease may continue as an ordinary intestinal
inflammation, which in hot weather is formidable and often fatal.If
the stools become more consistent and less frequent without the
occurrence of cerebral symptoms, while the limbs are warm and the pulse
good, we may confidently express the opinion that there is no present
danger.The duration of true cholera infantum is short.It either ends fatally,
or it begins soon to abate and ceases, or it continues, and is not to
be distinguished in its subsequent course from an attack of summer
diarrhoea beginning in the ordinary manner.TREATMENT.--Preventive Measures.--Obviously, efficient preventive
measures consist in the removal of infants so far as practicable from
the operation of the causes which produce the disease.Weaning just
before or in the hot weather should, if possible, be avoided, and
removal to the country should be recommended, especially for those who
are deprived of the breast-milk during the age when such nutriment is
required.If for any reason it is necessary to employ artificial
feeding for infants under the age of ten months, that food should
obviously be used which most closely resembles human milk in
digestibility and in nutritive properties.Care should be taken to
prevent fermentation in the food before its use, since much harm is
done by the employment of milk or other food in which fermentative
changes have occurred and which occur quickly in dietetic mixtures in
the hot months.It is also very important that the infant receive its food in proper
quantity and at proper intervals, for if the mother or nurse in her
anxiety to have it thrive feed it too often or in too large quantity,
the surplus food which it cannot digest if not vomited undergoes
fermentation, and consequently becomes irritating to the
gastro-intestinal surface.The physician should be able to give advice
not only in reference to the frequency of feeding, but also in regard
to the quantity of food which the infant requires at each feeding.Correct knowledge and advice in this matter aid in the prevention and
cure of the dyspeptic and diarrhoeal maladies of infancy.Chadbourne of this city and myself made some observations in order to
ascertain how much food well-nourished infants receive daily.We
selected infants that had an abundance of breast-milk, and weighed them
before and after each nursing, so as to determine how much each infant
took during twenty-four hours.The avoirdupois ounce contains 437.5
grains, and we ascertained by careful weight and measurement, employing
the metric system for its greater accuracy, that one fluidounce of
human milk, with a specific gravity of 1.031, weighed 451.9 grains.With these data it was easy to determine the quantity of milk in
fluidounces from its weight.Our first observations related to 12
infants under the age of five weeks, 8 of which nursed twelve times,
and the remaining 4 eight, nine, nine, and eleven times respectively,
in the twenty-four hours.The quantity of milk received by them in
twenty-four hours varied considerably in the different cases, but the
average was 12.41 fluidounces.Therefore if a baby in the first five
weeks nurse every two hours, it receives only a little more than one
fluidounce at each nursing.The next observations were made upon 15 infants between the ages of
five weeks and ten months: 8 of the 15 were under the age of six {747}
months, and the remaining 7 were between the ages of six months and ten
months.The weighing showed that the younger took nearly the same
quantity per day, on the average, as the older infants in this group.The average quantity received by each was twenty-four and six-tenths
fluidounces.Hence if the nursings were eight in the twenty-four hours,
three ounces were taken at each nursing; if the nursings were twelve,
the quantity each time was two ounces.Biedert of Germany has also made similar observations in order to
determine the amount of nutriment required by infants.The results of
his weight-studies, as he designates them, were published in the
_Jahrbuch fur Kinderheilkunde_, xix.B., 3 H. His weighing showed that
infants during their first month, if fed on cow's milk, required from
160 to 200 grammes of milk daily, and in the third month 300 grammes.These quantities in fluid measure are 5.44 to 6.83 ounces, the quantity
required each day in the first month, and 10.22 ounces, the quantity
required daily the second month.Therefore, both my weights and
Biedert's show that infants under the age of two months assimilate a
smaller quantity of milk than is usually supposed.For infants older
than two months he estimates the quantity of milk required by infants
by their weight.He believes that the greater the weight the greater is
the amount of food which the infant needs.The method pursued by
Chadbourne and myself is more simple, and it seems to indicate with
sufficient exactness the amount of food required.Some infants, like adults, need more food than others, so that there
can be no exact schedule of the quantity which they require at each
feeding; but while in the first and second months they do not need more
than from one to one and a half fluidounces at each feeding, whether of
breast-milk, or of cow's milk prepared so as to resemble as closely as
possible human milk, infants as they grow older and their stomachs
enlarge can take food in larger quantity, and therefore require less
frequent feeding.Under the age of two months the stomach is so small
that it cannot receive much more than one or one and a half fluidounces
without undue distension.At the age of six months it can probably
receive and digest without discomfort three ounces, and in the last
half of the first year even four ounces.Infants nourished at the
breast should be allowed to nurse every two hours in the daytime,
whatever the age, after the second month, but less frequently at night,
for frequent nursing promotes the secretion of milk, and the milk is of
better quality than when it is long retained in the breast.If by the
fifth or sixth month mothers or wet-nurses find, as is frequently the
case, that they do not have sufficient milk, other food should be given
in addition, perhaps after each second nursing or every fourth hour.The kind of food which it is best to employ to supplement the nursing
will be mentioned under the head of curative measures.By knowledge on
the part of the mother and nurse of the dietetic needs of the infant,
and by consequent judicious alimentation, and by measures also to
procure the utmost purity of the air, there can be no doubt that the
summer diarrhoea may to a great extent be prevented.Curative Treatment.--The indications for treatment are--1st, to provide
the best possible food; 2d, to procure pure air; 3d, to aid the
digestive function of the infant; 4th, to employ such medicinal agents
as can be safely given to check the diarrhoea and cure the intestinal
catarrh.{748} The infant with this disease is thirsty, and is therefore apt to
take more nutriment in the liquid form than it requires for its
sustenance.If nursing, it craves the breast, or if weaned, craves the
bottle, at short intervals to relieve the thirst.No more nutriment
should be allowed than is required for nutrition, for the reason stated
above, and the thirst may best be relieved by a little cold water,
gum-water, or barley-water, to which a few drops of brandy or whiskey
are added.Since one of the two important factors in producing the summer
diarrhoea is the use of improper food, it is obviously very important
for the successful treatment of this disease that the food should be of
the right kind, properly prepared, and given in proper quantity.I need
not repeat that for infants under the age of one year no food is so
suitable as breast-milk, and one affected with the diarrhoea and
remaining in the city should, if possible, at least if under the age of
ten months, be provided with breast-milk.It can be more satisfactorily
treated and the chances of its recovery are much greater if it be
nourished with human milk than by any other kind of diet.If, however,
the mother's milk fail or become unsuitable from ill-health or
pregnancy, and on account of family circumstances a wet-nurse cannot be
procured, the important and difficult duty devolves upon the physician
of deciding how the infant should be fed.In order to solve this
problem it will be well to recall to mind the part performed in the
digestive function by the different secretions which digest food:

1st.It converts starch into glucose
or grape-sugar.It has no effect upon fat or the protein group.It is
the secretion of the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual glands,
which in infants under the age of three months are very small, almost
rudimentary.The two parotid glands at the age of one month weigh only
thirty-four grains.The power to convert starch into sugar possessed by
saliva is due to a ferment which it contains called ptyalin.The gastric juice is a thin, nearly transparent, and colorless
fluid, acid from the presence of a little hydrochloric acid.It
produces no change in starch, grape-sugar, or the fats, except that it
dissolves the covering of the fat-cells.Its function is to convert the
proteids into peptone, which is effected by its active principle,
termed pepsin.The bile is alkaline and neutralizes the acid product of gastric
digestion.It forms soaps with the
fatty acids and has a slight emulsifying action on fat.The soaps are
said to promote the emulsion of fat.Their emulsifying power is
believed to be increased by admixture with the pancreatic secretion.Moreover, the absorption of oil is facilitated by the presence of bile
upon the surface through which it passes.The pancreatic juice appears to have the function of digesting
whatever alimentary substance has escaped digestion by the saliva,
gastric juice, and bile.It is a clear, viscid liquid of alkaline
reaction.It converts proteids
into peptones and emulsifies fats.While the gastric juice requires an
acid medium for the performance of its digestive function, the
pancreatic juice requires one that is alkaline.This important fact
should be borne in mind, that such a mistake as presenting pepsin with
chalk mixture, or the extractum pancreatis with dilute muriatic acid,
may be avoided.The intestinal secretions are mainly from the crypts of
Lieberkuhn, and their action in the digestive process is probably
comparatively unimportant, but in some animals they have been found to
digest starch.It will be observed that of all these secretions that
which digests the largest number of nutritive principles is the
pancreatic.It digests all those which are essential to the maintenance
of life except fat, and it aids the bile in emulsifying fat.One of the most important conferences in paediatrics ever held convened
at Salzburg in 1881 for the purpose of considering the diet of infants.Among those who participated in the discussion were men known
throughout the world as authorities in children's diseases, such as
Demme, Biedert, Gerhardt, Henoch, Steffen, Thomas, and Soltmann.None
of the physicians present dissented from the following proposition of
the chairman: That "all the advances made in physiology in respect to
the digestive organs of children only go to prove that the mother's
milk is the only true material which is quantitatively and
qualitatively suited to the development of the child, which preserves
the physiological functions of the organs of digestion, and under
favorable circumstances of growth unfolds the whole organism in its
completeness."All agreed that when the breast-milk fails animal milk
is the best substitute.Henoch, who was one of the conference,
expresses the same opinion in his well-known treatise on diseases of
children, as follows: "Cow's milk is the best substitute for mother's
milk during the entire period of infancy.I consider the administration
of other substances advisable only when good cow's milk cannot be
obtained or when it gives rise to constant vomiting and diarrhoea."The many infants' foods contained in the shops were considered by the
conference, and, in the words of the chairman, "Now and evermore it is
unanimously agreed that these preparations can in no way be substituted
for mother's milk, and as exclusive food during the first year are to
be entirely and completely rejected."But, unfortunately, we soon learn
by experience that animal milk, although it is the best of the
substitutes for human milk, is, especially as dispensed in the cities,
faulty.It is digested with difficulty by young infants, and is apt to
cause in them diarrhoea and intestinal catarrh.Therefore in the hot
months its use is very apt to act as one of the dietetic causes of the
summer diarrhoea in infants exclusively fed upon it, unless it be
specially prepared so as to more closely resemble human milk.The
frequent unsatisfactory results of its use have led to the preparation
of the many proprietary substitutes for human milk which the shops
contain, and which have been so summarily discarded by the German
conference.Woman's milk in health is always alkaline.It has a specific gravity of
1.0317; cow's milk has a specific gravity of 1.029.That of cows
stabled and fed upon other fodder than hay or grass is usually
decidedly acid.That from cows in the country with good pasturage is
said to be alkaline, but in two dairies in Central New York a hundred
miles apart, in midsummer, with an abundant pasturage, two competent
persons whom I requested to make the examinations found the milk
slightly acid immediately after the milking in all the cows.The following results of a large number of analyses of woman's and
cow's milk, made by Konig and quoted by Leeds, and of several of the
{750} best known and most used preparations designed by their inventors
to be substitutes for human milk, show how far these substitutes
resemble the natural aliment in their chemical characters:

It is seen by examination of the analyses of the above foods that all
except such as consist largely or wholly of cow's milk differ widely
from human milk in their composition, and although some of them--as the
Liebig preparations, in which starch is converted into glucose by the
action of the diastase of malt--may aid in the nutrition and be useful
as adjuncts to milk, physicians of experience and close observation
will, I think, agree with the German conference that when breast-milk
fails or is insufficient our main reliance for the successful nutrition
of the infant must be on animal milk.Nestle's Food, which consists of
wheat flour, the yelk of egg, condensed milk, and sugar, and which has
been so largely used in this country and in Europe, is probably
beneficial mainly from the large amount of Swiss condensed milk which
it contains.Although the preference is to be given to animal milk over any other
kind of food as a substitute for human milk, yet even when obtained
fresh and from the best dairies and properly diluted it is very apt to
disagree with infants under the age of one year, producing indigestion
and diarrhoea.The close resemblance in chemical character of cow's,
ass's, and goat's milk to human milk would lead us to expect that
either would be a good substitute for the latter.The fact that the
milk of these animals is apt to cause indigestion and intestinal
catarrh, especially in the hot months, when the digestive function of
the infant is enfeebled from the heat, must be due to the quality
rather than quantity of its constituents.The difference in quality of
the casein of human and animal milk is well known, since that of human
milk coagulates in the stomach in flakes, and that of animal milk in
firm and large masses.The German conference saw at once the importance
of the problem which confronted them--_i.e._ how to modify cow's milk
so that it bears the closest possible resemblance to human milk.They
even discussed the difference of the milk of different breeds of cows,
and the proper feeding and care of cows, but the most important
suggestion made--and one which has already produced good results in
this country and in Europe, and promises to be instrumental in saving
the lives of many infants who by the old method of feeding would
inevitably perish--was made by Pfeiffer of Wiesbaden.I allude to the
peptonizing of milk.The pancreatic secretion digests milk that is
rendered alkaline at a temperature between 100 degrees and 150 degrees
F. Milk thus treated becomes in from twenty minutes to one hour
thinner, resembling human milk in appearance, and if the peptonizing be
continued beyond a certain point, and is more complete, its taste is
decidedly {752} bitter.The process should be watched and the
peptonizing suspended as soon as the bitterness becomes appreciable,
for, although more advanced peptonizing so changes the milk that it is
more easily digested by the infant than when the peptonizing is
partial, yet the bitterness which is imparted to it renders it very
disagreeable as a dietetic preparation.Milk thus prepared closely
resembles human milk in appearance, and its casein is so digested that
it is either not precipitated by acids or is precipitated, like that of
human milk, in flakes.By this process a digested or an easily-digested
casein is produced, instead of the casein of ordinary cow's milk, which
produces large and firm masses in the stomach--masses that the
digestive ferments penetrate with such difficulty that they cause
indigestion, and occur in the stools in coagula of greater or less
size.Pfeiffer pointed out that when peptonized milk is employed "the
feces showed absolutely no trace of the white cheesiness."Milk thus
prepared quickly spoils, and it is necessary to peptonize it in small
quantity and often during the twenty-four hours.In New York City during the last year peptonized milk has been employed
largely as recommended by Pfeiffer, and with such results as to
encourage its further use.It is now used in the New York Infant Asylum
and New York Foundling Asylum.Five grains of extractum pancreatis
(Fairchild & Co.'s) and ten grains of sodium bicarbonate are added to
one gill of warm water.This is mixed with one pint of warm milk, and
the mixture, in some convenient vessel, is placed in water kept at a
temperature of 100 degrees F. for one hour, when it is placed upon ice
to prevent further digestion.It should be tasted frequently during the
peptonizing process, and if the least bitterness be observed the
process should be suspended before the expiration of the hour.With
some specimens of milk, especially at a temperature of 115 degrees to
120 degrees, a half hour or even less is sufficient.This artificial
digestion is arrested either by boiling the peptonized milk, which
destroys the ferment, or by reducing its temperature to near the
freezing-point, which renders it latent and inactive, but does not
destroy it.I need not add that placing the peptonized milk on ice is
preferable to boiling it, since we wish the ferment to continue to act
in the stomach of the infant.In the present state of our knowledge of
infant feeding, therefore, we can recommend no better substitute for
human milk than peptonized cow's milk.Leeds recommended the following formula for peptonizing milk in his
very instructive remarks made before the New York County Medical
Association, July 16, 1884.In order that no mistake might be made, I
wrote to him for his formula, which he kindly sent me.The following is
an extract from his letter: "The formula which I ventured to suggest
for the preparation of humanized cow's milk was as follows: 1 gill of
cow's milk, fresh and unskimmed; 1 gill of water; 2 tablespoonfuls of
rich cream; 200 grains of milk-sugar; 1-1/2 grains of extractum
pancreatis; 4 grains of sodium bicarbonate.Put this in a
nursing-bottle; place the bottle in water made so warm that the whole
hand cannot be held in it without pain longer than one minute.Keep the
milk at this temperature for exactly twenty minutes.The milk should be
prepared just before using."The object is of course to provide from cow's milk a food which will be
the nearest possible approximation to healthy human milk; and this
{753} appears to be achieved by the peptonizing process.Certainly,
what physicians have long been desiring--namely, some mode of preparing
cow's milk so that its casein will coagulate in flakes like that of
human milk--has been obtained by peptonizing.It is a common error to expect too much of a new remedy which has a
real value, and we must not expect that all patients not in an utterly
hopeless state will begin to improve as soon as peptonized milk is
prepared for them, or that it is a full and exact substitute for human
milk, so that wet-nurses may be dispensed with.Healthy human milk is
the best of all food for infants under the age of twelve months, and
should always be preferred when it can be obtained, but we claim that
peptonized milk is a most useful addition to the dietetic preparations
for infants, probably surpassing in value the best of those in the
shops.We employ it in the belief that it affords important aid in
curing the dyspeptic and diarrhoeal maladies of infancy.Who first
formulated and recommended the process of peptonizing milk I am not
able to state, but I am informed that Roberts of Great Britain called
attention to it as a means of improving milk at a time antedating the
German conference.Milk from healthy, properly-fed cows may be prepared without
peptonizing, so as to agree with many infants except in the warmest
weather, but is obviously less easily digested than peptonized milk.It
should be diluted as follows with water boiled so as to free it from
germs: In the first week after birth one-fourth milk with the addition
of a little sugar.The milk should be gradually increased, so that it
is one-third by the end of the fourth week, one-half by the end of the
third month, and two-thirds to three-fourths by the end of the sixth
month.After the sixth month it is still proper to add one-fourth
water, but pure milk may be given.Before peptonizing--which, as we have seen, digests the casein to a
great extent, and changes that which is not digested so that it
coagulates in flakes in the stomach like breast-milk--was resorted to,
it was customary to use a thin barley- or oat-water in place of the
water used for diluting the milk.One heaped teaspoonful of barley
flour to two tablespoonfuls of water make a gruel of proper
consistence.A little farinaceous substance added to the milk by
mechanically separating the particles of casein tends to prevent their
coagulation in large and firm masses.This was the theory which
explained the beneficial action of the admixture.If for any reason
peptonized milk be not employed, milk prepared in the way I have
mentioned, by admixture with a farinaceous substance, is probably the
next best substitute for human milk.It is very important to determine when and how farinaceous foods shall
be given in this disease.It is well known that infants under the age
of three months digest starch with difficulty and only in small
quantity, since the salivary and pancreatic glands which secrete the
ferments which digest starch are almost rudimentary at that age.The
artificial digestion of starch is, however, easily accomplished.Among
the last labors of the renowned chemist Baron Liebig was the
preparation of a food for infants in which the starch is digested and
transformed into grape-sugar, and thus infants at any age who are fed
with it are relieved of the burden of digesting it.The baron led the
way which has been so successfully followed since in the artificial
digestion of foods.A considerable part of the starch {754} in wheat
flour is converted into grape-sugar by the prolonged action of heat.I
frequently recommend that from three to five pounds of wheat flour be
packed dry in a firm muslin bag, so as to form a ball, and be placed in
water sufficient to cover it constantly and the bag kept over the fire
three or four days.During the nights the fire may go out for a few
hours.At the expiration of this time the external part, which is wet,
being peeled off, the remainder resembles a lump of yellowish chalk.The flour grated from it gives a decided reaction of sugar by Fehling's
test.Starch is also quickly transformed into glucose by the action of
the diastase of malt, which indeed Liebig employed.If to a gruel of
barley flour, oatmeal, or other farinaceous substance, when hot, a
little of a good preparation of extract of malt, such as that prepared
by Trommer & Co.at Fremont, Ohio, which acts promptly, or by Reed &
Carnrick, be added, it becomes thinner.It is claimed that the starch
is thus quickly converted into glucose; which seems doubtful.It is,
however, so modified that it is apparently more readily digested and
assimilated.Farinaceous substances thus prepared may be employed with
peptonized or other milk.Infants frequently do better with this
admixture than when either the milk or gruel is used separately.Of the foods contained in the shops which have been most prescribed,
and which have apparently been useful in certain cases, I may mention
those which have been prepared according to Liebig's formula, of which
there are several, the analyses of which I have given, and Nestle's
farina.In the use of those foods which contain no milk, as Ridge's
food, Imperial granum, etc., it is recommended that milk be added,
while for such as contain condensed milk, as Nestle's and the
Anglo-Swiss food, only water should be employed.The Anglo-Swiss food
contains about 60 per cent.each
of oatmeal and Russian wheat flour.It gives an acid reaction, unlike
Nestle's, which is alkaline.When Biedert's cream conserve was
announced great expectations were awakened from the fact that the
inventor is an authority in paediatrics, but, unfortunately, they have
not been realized in this country.Much of Biedert's conserve when it
reaches us is spoiled, and the directions for its use are too
complicated for ordinary family use, since a different mixture is
required for each month of the infant's age.I have employed this food,
but, with Henoch, "could not convince myself that it is more
efficacious than cow's milk."I am informed that the sale of it in this
country has ceased.Condensed milk is largely used in the feeding of infants.The milk is
condensed in vacuo to one-third or one-fifth its volume, heated to 100
degrees C.to kill any fungus which it contains, and
38 to 40 per cent.of cane-sugar is added to preserve it.In the first
month one part of milk should be added to sixteen of water, and the
proportion of water should be gradually reduced as the infant becomes
older.The large amount of sugar which condensed milk, preserved in
cans, contains renders it unsuitable in the dietetic role of the summer
diarrhoea of infants.The sugar is apt to produce acid fermentation and
diarrhoea in hot weather.Borden's condensed milk, freshly prepared, as
dispensed from the wagons, contains, I am informed by the agent, no
cane-sugar or other foreign substance, and on this account is to be
preferred to that in the cans.It is cow's milk of good quality, from
which 75 to 79 per cent.of the water {755} has been removed under
vacuum.The sole advantage which it possesses--and it is an important
one--is that it resists fermentation longer than the ordinary milk.To select the best food for the infant from this considerable number of
dietetic preparations is one of the most important duties of the
physician.If called to an infant unfortunately deprived of wholesome
breast-milk, and suffering in consequence from indigestion and
diarrhoea, what diet shall we recommend?My recommendation would be as
follows: Use cow's milk of the best possible quality and peptonized in
the manner stated above, and peptonized in small quantity at a time,
such as a pint, or, better, half a pint.This may be the sole food till
the age of five or six months.Unfortunately, in the cities the milk
that is delivered in the morning is the milking of the preceding
evening, mixed with that of the preceding morning, brought often many
miles from the farms where it is produced.Milk twelve and twenty-four
hours old, notwithstanding the use of ice around the milk-cans, is apt
to undergo some fermentative change before it reaches the nursery.This
prevents the preparation of the best quality of peptonized milk, so
that in some instances during the heated term I have found that the
peptonized milk did not agree as well as the condensed milks, like
Borden's or Nestle's food.Not a few infants suffering from diarrhoeal
maladies seem to do better if some farinaceous food properly prepared
be added to the peptonized milk than when the milk is used alone.It is
better, I think, that the starch, or a considerable part of the starch,
be converted into glucose before the admixture.This can be done if a
few pounds of wheat flour be pressed dry in a bag, so as to form a
ball, and boiled three or four days, as I have elsewhere recommended.The flour grated from the mass gives a decided sugar reaction to
Fehling's test.For infants under the age of six months one
tablespoonful of the flour thus prepared should be mixed with twelve
tablespoonfuls of water and boiled.When it has been removed from the
fire and become tepid, a small quantity of a good extract of malt, as
Trommer's or Reed & Carnrick's, may advantageously be added to the
gruel to increase the transformation of starch and render it more
digestible.To avoid the time and trouble of preparing the food in this
manner, one of the foods contained in the shops, in which the starch
has been transformed into glucose by the employment of Baron Liebig's
formula, may be used, as Mellin's or Horlick's, instead of the wheat
flour prepared by long boiling.The older the child, the thicker should
be the gruel.Beef-, mutton-, or chicken-tea should not be employed, at least as it
is ordinarily made, since it is too laxative.Occasionally, for the
older infants, we may allow the expressed juice of beef, raw scraped
beef, or beef-tea prepared by adding half a pound of lean beef, finely
minced, to one pint of cold water, and after allowing it to stand for
half an hour warming it to a temperature not exceeding 110 degrees for
another half hour.Salt
should be added to it, and I am in the habit of adding to it also about
seven drops of dilute muriatic acid to facilitate its digestion.It is
chiefly for infants over the age of ten months that the meat-juices are
proper.A concentrated nutriment, prepared, it is stated, from beef,
mutton, and fruits, has lately been introduced in the shops under the
name Murdoch's Liquid Food.Young {756} infants with dyspeptic and
diarrhoeal symptoms can take it, and it appears to be readily
assimilated, as the quantity given at each feeding is small.It has its
advocates, and it appears to be of some service in cases of weak and
irritable stomach.But since one of the two important factors in producing the summer
diarrhoea of infants is foul air, it is obvious that measures should be
employed to render the atmosphere in which the infant lives as free as
possible from noxious effluvia.Cleanliness of the person, of the
bedding, and of the house in which the patient resides, the prompt
removal of all refuse animal or vegetable matter, whether within or
around the premises, and allowing the infant to remain a considerable
part of the day in shaded localities where the air is pure, as in the
parks or suburbs of the city, are important measures.In New York great
benefit has resulted from the floating hospital which every second day
during the heated term carries a thousand sick children from the
stifling air of the tenement-houses down the bay and out to the fresh
air of the ocean.But it is difficult to obtain an atmosphere that is entirely pure in a
large city with its many sources of insalubrity; and all physicians of
experience agree in the propriety of sending infants affected with the
summer diarrhoea to localities in the country which are free from
malaria and sparsely inhabited, in order that they may obtain the
benefits of a purer air.Many are the instances each summer in New York
City of infants removed to the country with intestinal inflammation,
with features haggard and shrunken, with limbs shrivelled and the skin
lying in folds, too weak to raise, or at least hold, their heads from
the pillow, vomiting nearly all the nutriment taken, stools frequent
and thin, resulting in great part from molecular disintegration of the
tissues--presenting, indeed, an appearance seldom observed in any other
disease except in the last stages of phthisis--and returning in late
autumn with the cheerfulness, vigor, and rotundity of health.The
localities usually preferred by the physicians of this city are the
elevated portions of New Jersey and Northern Pennsylvania, the
Highlands of the Hudson, the central and northern parts of New York
State, and Northern New England.Taken to a salubrious locality and
properly fed, the infant soon begins to improve if the disease be still
recent, unless it be exceptionally severe.If the disease have
continued several weeks at the time of the removal, little benefit may
be observed from the country residence until two or more weeks have
elapsed.An infant weakened and wasted by the summer diarrhoea, removed to a
cool locality in the country, should be warmly dressed and kept indoor
when the heavy night dew is falling.Patients sometimes become worse
from injudicious exposure of this kind, the intestinal catarrh from
which they are suffering being aggravated by taking cold, and perhaps
rendered dysenteric.Sometimes parents, not noticing the immediate improvement which they
have been led to expect, return to the city without giving the country
fair trial, and the life of the infant is then, as a rule, sacrificed.Returned to the foul air of the city while the weather is still warm,
it sinks rapidly from an aggravation of the malady.Occasionally, the
change from one rural locality to another, like the change from one
wet-nurse to another, has a salutary effect.The infant, although it
{757} has recovered, should not be brought back while the weather is
still warm.One attack of the disease does not diminish, but increases,
the liability to a second seizure.Medicinal Treatment.--The summer diarrhoea of infants requires, to some
extent, different treatment in its early and later stages.We have seen
that acids, especially the lactic and butyric, the results of faulty
digestion, are produced abundantly, causing acid stools.In a few days
the inflammatory irritation of the mucous follicles causes such an
exaggerated secretion of mucus which is alkaline that the acid is
nearly or quite neutralized.In the commencement of the attack these
acid and irritating products should be as quickly as possible
neutralized, while we endeavor to prevent their production by improving
the diet and assisting the digestion.In the second stage, when the
fecal matter is less acid and irritating from the large admixture of
mucus, medicines are required to improve digestion and check the
diarrhoea, while the indication for antacids is less urgent.Therefore
it is convenient to consider separately the treatment which is proper
in the commencement or first stage, and that which is required in the
subsequent course of the disease.First stage, or during the first three or four days, perhaps the first
week.--Occasionally, it is proper to commence the treatment by the
employment of some gentle purgative, especially when the disease begins
abruptly after the use of indigestible and irritating food.A single
dose of castor oil or syrup of rhubarb, or the two mixed, will remove
the irritating substance, and afterward opiates or the remedies
designed to control the disease can be more successfully employed.Ordinarily, such preliminary treatment is not required.Diarrhoea has
generally continued a few days when the physician is summoned, and no
irritating substance remains save the acid which is so abundantly
generated in the intestines in this disease, and which we have the
means of removing without purgation.The same general plan of medicinal treatment is appropriate for the
summer diarrhoea of infants as for diarrhoea from other causes; but the
acid fermentation commonly present indicates the need of antacids,
which should be employed in most of the mixtures used in the first
stage as long as the stools have a decidedly acid reaction.Those who accept the theory that this disease is produced by
micro-organisms which lodge on the gastro-intestinal surface and
produce diarrhoea by their irritating effect are naturally led to
employ antiseptic remedies.Guaita administered for this purpose sodium
benzoate.One drachm or a drachm and a half dissolved in three ounces
of water were administered in twenty-four hours with, it is stated,
good results.[3] I have no experience in the use of antiseptic
remedies.If by the appearance of the stools or the substance ejected from the
stomach, or by the usual test of litmus-paper, the presence of an acid
in an irritating quantity be ascertained or suspected, lime-water or a
little sodium bicarbonate may be added to the food.The creta
praeparata of the Pharmacopoeia administered every two hours, or, which
is more convenient, the mistura cretae, is a useful antacid for such a
case.By the alkalies alone,
aided by the judicious use of stimulants, the disease is sometimes
arrested, but, unless {758} circumstances are favorable and the case be
mild, other remedies are required.Opium has long been used, and it retains its place as one of the
important remedies in this disease.For the treatment of a young infant
paregoric is a convenient opiate preparation.For the age of one to two
months the dose is from three to five drops; for the age of six months,
twelve drops, repeated every three hours or at longer intervals
according to the state of the patient.After the age of six months the
stronger preparations of opium are more commonly used.The tinctura
opii deodorata or Squibb's liquor opii compositus may be given in doses
of one drop at the age of one year.Dover's powder in doses of
three-fourths of a grain, or the pulvis cretae comp.cum opio in
three-grain doses every third hour, may be given to an infant of one
year.Opium is, however, in general best given in mixtures which will be
mentioned hereafter.It quiets the action of the intestines and
diminishes the number of the evacuations.It is contraindicated or
should be used with caution if cerebral symptoms are present.Sometimes
in the commencement of the disease, when it begins abruptly from some
error in diet, with high temperature, drowsiness, twitching of the
limbs--symptoms which threaten eclampsia--opiates should be given
cautiously before free evacuations occur from the bowels and the
offending substance is expelled.Under such circumstances a few doses
of the bromide of potassium are preferable.In the advanced stage of
the disease also, when symptoms of spurious hydrocephalus occur, opium
should be withheld or cautiously administered, since it might tend to
increase the fatal stupor in which severe cases are apt to terminate.The vegetable astringents, although they have been largely employed in
the treatment of this as well as other forms of infantile diarrhoea,
are, I think, much less frequently prescribed than formerly.I have
entirely discarded them, since they are apt to be vomited and have not
proved efficient in my practice.As a substitute for them the
subnitrate of bismuth has come into use, and in much larger doses than
were formerly employed.While it aids in checking the diarrhoea, it is
an efficient antiemetic and antiseptic.It should be prescribed in ten
or twelve grains for an infant of twelve months; larger doses produce
no ill effect, for its action is almost entirely local and soothing to
the inflamed surface with which it comes in contact.It undergoes a
chemical change in the stomach and intestines, becoming black, being
converted into the bismuth sulphide, and it causes dark stools.Rarely
it gives rise in the infant to the well-known garlicky odor, like that
occasionally observed in adult patients, and which Squibb thinks may be
due to tellurium accidentally associated with the bismuth in its
natural state.For those cases in which the symptoms are chiefly due to
colitis, and the stools contain blood with a large proportion of mucus,
it has been customary to prescribe laudanum or some other form of opium
with castor oil.I prefer, however, the bismuth and opium for such
cases as are more decidedly dysenteric, as well as for cases of the
usual form of intestinal catarrh.In ordering bismuth in these large
doses it is important that a pure article be dispensed.The following are convenient and useful formulae for a child of one
year: {759}

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidrachm ij;
      Misturae cretae,      fluidrachm xiv.Shake thoroughly and give one teaspoonful every two to four hours.minim xvj;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidounce ss;
      Aq.cinnamomi,        fluidounce iss.Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful every two to four hours.drachm ij;
      Pulv.X. Dose, one powder every three hours.drachm ij;
      Pulv.Cholera infantum requires similar treatment to that which is proper for
the ordinary form of the summer diarrhoea, but there is no disease,
unless it is pseudo-membranous croup, in which early and appropriate
treatment is more urgently required, since the tendency is to rapid
sinking and death.As early as possible, therefore, proper instructions
should be given in regard to the feeding, and for an infant between the
ages of eight and twelve months either one of the above prescriptions
should be given or the following:

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Spts.fluidrachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidounce ss;
      Misturae cretae,      fluidounce iss.Give one teaspoonful every two or three hours.An infant of six months can take one-half the dose, and one of three or
four months one-third or one-fourth the dose, of either of the above
mixtures.If cerebral symptoms appear, as rolling the head, drowsiness, etc., I
usually write the prescription without the opiate; and with this
omission it may be given more frequently if the case require it, while
the opiate prescribed alone or with bromide of potassium is given
guardedly and at longer intervals.Although every day during the summer
months I have written the above prescriptions, it has been several
years since any case has occurred in my practice which led me to regret
the use of the opiate; but it must not be forgotten that there is
danger in the summer complaint, and especially in cholera infantum, of
the sudden supervention of stupor, amounting even to coma, and ending
fatally.A few instances have come to my knowledge in which, when death
occurred in this way, the friends believed that the melancholy result
was hastened by the medicine.But injury to the patient in this respect
can only occur, in my opinion, through carelessness in not giving
proper attention to his condition.It is chiefly in advanced cases,
when the vital powers are beginning to fail, when the innervation is
deficient, and the cerebral circulation sluggish, that the use of
opiates may involve danger.Explicit and positive directions should
{760} be given to omit the opiate or give it less frequently whenever
the evacuations are checked wholly or partially and signs of stupor
appear.Second Stage.--The summer complaint in a large proportion of cases
begins in such a gradual way that the treatment which we are about to
recommend is proper in many instances at the first visit of the
physician, who is frequently not summoned till the attack has continued
one or two weeks.The alkaline treatment recommended above for the
diarrhoea in its commencement does not aid digestion sufficiently to
justify its continuance as the main remedy after the first few days.In
a large number of instances, however, one of the above alkaline
mixtures may be given with advantage midway between the nursings or
feedings, while those remedies, presently to be mentioned, which
facilitate digestion and assimilation are given at the time of the
reception of food.Some physicians of large experience, as Henoch of Berlin, recommend
small doses of calomel, as the twelfth or twentieth of a grain, three
or four times daily for infants with faulty digestion and diarrhoea.To
me, this seems an uncertain remedy, without sufficient indications for
its use, and I have therefore no experience with it.The following are
formulae which I employ in my own practice, and which have been
employed with apparent good results in the institutions of New York:

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Pepsinae saccharat.(Hawley's or other good pepsin), drachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,                            fluidrachm ij;
      Aquae,                             fluidrachm xiv.M.

Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful before each feeding or nursing to an
infant of one year; half a teaspoonful to one of six months.minim xvj;
      Acid.minim xvj;
      Pepsinae saccharat.drachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidrachm ij;
      Aquae,                fluidrachm xiv.Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful every three hours to a child of one
year; half a teaspoonful to one of six months.drachm j-ij;
      Bismuth.One powder every three hours to a child of one
year; half a powder to one of six months.I have also obtained apparent benefit from lactopeptin, given as a
substitute for one of the above mixtures before each feeding or
nursing.In several instances which I recall to mind I have ordered as
much as could be placed on a ten-cent piece to be given every second or
third hour, while midway between the feedings in some instances of
considerable diarrhoea one of the mixtures of bismuth and chalk
recommended above was employed, and the result has been good.Enemata.--It will be recollected, from our remarks on the anatomical
characters, that inflammatory lesions are commonly present in the
entire length of the colon, and that at the sigmoid flexure, where acid
and irritating fecal matter is probably longest delayed in its passage
downward, the colitis is usually most severe.Aware of this fact, I was
{761} led to prescribe at my first visit a large clyster of warm water,
given with the fountain or Davidson's rubber syringe, especially in
cases in which the stools showed mucus or mucus tinged with blood.This, given with the lower part of the body raised a little above the
level of the shoulders, washes out the large intestine and has a
soothing effect upon its surface.The benzoate of sodium may be added
to the water for its antiseptic effect, as in the following formula:

  Rx.drachm j;
      Aquae,         pint j.  Misce.In occasional cases in which the stomach is very irritable, so that
medicines given by the mouth are in great part rejected, our reliance
must be largely on rectal medication, and especially on clysters
containing an opiate.Laudanum may be given in this manner with marked
benefit.It may be given mixed with a little starch-water, and the best
instrument for administering it is a small glass or gutta-percha
syringe, the nurse retaining the enema for a time by means of a
compress.Beck in his _Infant Therapeutics_ advises to give by the
clyster twice as much of the opiate as would be required by the mouth.A somewhat larger proportion may, however, be safely employed.The
following formula for a clyster has given me more satisfaction than any
other medicated enema which I have employed:

  Rx.iv;
      Bismuth.ss;
      Mucilag.acaciae,
      Aquae,         _aa_ fluidounce ij.One-quarter to one half of this should be given at a time, with the
addition of as much laudanum as is thought proper; and it should be
retained by the compress.It is especially useful when from the large
amount of mucus or mucus tinged with blood it is probable that the
descending colon is chiefly involved.Alcoholic stimulants are required almost from the commencement of the
disease, and they should be employed in all protracted cases.Whiskey
or brandy is the best of these stimulants, and it should be given in
small doses at intervals of two hours.I usually order three or four
drops for an infant of one month, and an additional drop or two drops
for each additional month.The stimulant is not only useful in
sustaining the vital powers, but it also aids in relieving the
irritability of the stomach and in preventing hypostasis in depending
portions of the lung and brain, which, as we have seen, is so frequent
in advanced cases.The vomiting which is so common a symptom in many cases greatly
increases the prostration, and should be immediately relieved if
possible.The following formulae will be found useful for it:

  Rx.drachm ij;
      Spts.fluidrachm ss-fluidrachm j;
      Syrupi,
      Aquae,          _aa_ fluidounce j.  Misce.Dose, one teaspoonful half-hourly or hourly if required,
made cold by a piece of ice.ij;
      Liquor.Dose, one teaspoonful, with a teaspoonful of milk (breast-milk if the
baby nurse), to be repeated according to the nausea.{762} Lime-water with an equal quantity of milk often relieves the
nausea when it is due to acids in the stomach, but it is rendered more
effectual in certain cases by the addition of carbolic acid, which
tends to check any fermentative process.Perhaps also some of the
recent antiseptic medicines introduced into our Pharmacopoeia, as the
benzoate of sodium, may be found useful for the vomiting.A minute dose
of tincture of ipecacuanha, as one-eighth of a drop in a teaspoonful of
ice-water, frequently repeated, has also been employed with alleged
benefit.Of these various antiemetics, my preference is for the bismuth in large
doses, with the aromatic spirits of ammonia, properly diluted, that the
ammonia do not irritate the stomach.Nevertheless, in certain patients
the nausea is very obstinate, and all these remedies fail.In such
cases absolute quiet of the infant on its back, the administration of
but little nutriment at a time, mustard over the epigastrium, and the
use of an occasional small piece of ice or the use of carbonic acid
water with ice in it, may relieve this symptom.In protracted cases, when the vital powers begin to fail, as indicated
by pallor, more or less emaciation, and loss of strength, the following
is the best tonic mixture with which I am acquainted.It aids in
restraining the diarrhoea, while it increases the appetite and
strength.It should not be prescribed until the inflammation has
assumed a subacute or chronic character:

  Rx.calumbae,     fluidrachm iij;
      Liq.ferri nitratis, minim xxvij;
      Syrupi,              fluidounce iij.Dose, one teaspoonful every three or four hours to an infant of one
year.{763}

(Sennertus); Scelotyrbe pituitosa (Perywinger); Mucositas intestinalis
colloides, Concretiones gelatiniformes intestinales (Laboulbene);
Tubular exudation-casts of the intestines (Hutchinson).DEFINITION.--The disease is a non-febrile affection, consisting in a
peculiar, and usually persistent, morbid condition of the intestinal
mucous membrane, marked by the periodical formation of viscous,
shreddy, or tubular exudates composed chiefly of mucin, on the
discharge of which temporary amelioration of the accompanying acute
digestive and nervous symptoms occurs.HISTORY.--Although no distinct and separate accounts of
pseudo-membranous enteritis occur in the medical writings of the
ancients, nor even in those dating up to the eighteenth century, yet
there may occasionally be detected in some of the descriptions of
certain pathological conditions grouped under such titles as colic,
passage of gall-stones, tenesmus, coeliac and pituitous affections,
diarrhoea, dysentery, etc., the peculiar features of the disease under
consideration.This confusion ruled up to a comparatively recent time.J. Mason Good,[1] writing in the first quarter of the nineteenth
century, groups the disease as a species of diarrhoea--diarrhoea
tubularis--and remarks that he had "never hitherto seen this species
classified, and not often described, although it occurred frequently in
practice."[Footnote 1: _Study of Medicine_, 1822.]Aretaeus,[2] in the second century, in discussing the subject of
dysentery, speaks of alvine discharges sometimes occurring of a
substance of considerable length, in many respects not to be
distinguished from a sound piece of intestine, which he regarded as the
inner coating of the bowel.{764} This false interpretation of a fact
arose from the circumstance that the membranous exudate occasionally
assumes a tubular form, bearing the impress of the inner surface of the
bowel upon which it is formed, and was perpetuated up to a
comparatively recent period by successive authors.This error befell
Simpson,[3] Morgagni,[4] Lancisi, and Spindler;[5] the last of whom
describes the material discharged as worked up into a "materia alba,
longa, compacta."Bauer[6] under the title of "intestinal moles" describes in Haller's
_Disputations_ the discharges of this disease as "concreta fibrosa
quaedam pro parte pinguedine rara abducta, membranacea molarum ex utero
muliebri rejectarum formam accurate sistentia."[Footnote 6: "De Moles Intestinorum," _Disputationes ad Morborum_,
Dresdae, 1747, p.In the same volume Kaempf[7] discourses on this subject under the title
of "infarction of the intestinal vessels," and also in a separate
treatise[8] published somewhat later.In the latter he groups the
disease with others of a far different nature, their only point of
convergence being preternatural alvine discharges.[Footnote 7: _De Infarctu Vasorum Ventriculi_, Basiliae, 1751.][Footnote 8: _Abhandlungen von einer neuer methode der hartnackigsten
Krankheiten die ihren Sitz im unterleibe haben, zu heilen_, Leipzig,
1784.]Subsequent authors, as a rule, fell into the same error, and it was not
until 1818 that membranous enteritis was discriminated by Powell[9]
from that condition in which we recognize the presence of gall-stones.Since then more correct views have prevailed, and the disease has now a
recognized place in nosology.ETIOLOGY.--As in other diseases of obscure nature, so in this, there
has been much divergence of opinion as to its cause.The influence of age is striking, as it is rarely seen in childhood or
in persons who have passed the forty-fifth year.Of my own cases, the
youngest was forty, and the oldest fifty-four.Rilliet and Barthez[10]
state that membranous formations in the intestinal canal of children
are very rare; that they always occupy the summits of the folds, rarely
the intervals, of the mucous membrane; and that they are detached in
layers of greater or less extent.Heyfelder[11] has described similar exudations under the name of
enteritis exudatoria.[Footnote 10: _Traite clinique pratique des Maladies des Enfants_, t.
i. p.[Footnote 11: _Studien in Gabiete der Heilwissenschaft_, p.Sex exerts as marked an influence as age, as the immense preponderance
of cases occurs in females.In an analysis of 100 cases, 4 only
occurred in males, 2 of which were children.All of my cases were
women; with the exception of two cases occurring in males, the same
experience is reported by Powell and by Copeland.In regard to temperament, it is undoubted that the disease invades
nervous and hypochondriacal subjects oftener than others, but all
temperaments are liable in the presence of those enervative influences
that degrade physical health and impair nerve-power.All of my patients
belonged to the nervous type.Whitehead says that those of a phlegmatic
temperament, not easily excited into action, or persons deficient in
elasticity of fibre, compose all but a very small percentage of the
sufferers from this {765} complaint, and he had particularly noticed
that a large proportion of the women have light flaxen hair, fair
complexions, and white skins.The determinative causes, whatever they may be, occasion perversion of
nutrition and innervation of the gastro-intestinal canal, principally,
I believe, by their action upon the ganglionic nerves presiding over
those functions originating the peculiar exudatory phenomena of this
disease.This condition of the nervous system once established, local
irritation of any sort may precipitate an attack, and hence the
multitudinous influences that have been assigned as exercising a
causative agency, as exposure to wet and cold, coarse, bad food, fecal
impaction, and the abuse of cathartic medicines, as alleged by
Grantham,[12] who asserts that the use of mercury, conjoined with a too
frequent use of aperient agents, is the cause of the disease in every
case.[Footnote 12: _Facts and Observations in Med.and Surg._, 1849, p.Farr considered the irritation of the intestinal canal owing to a
parasitic growth of a confervoid type (oscillatoria).This view is
supported by no other authority than that of himself and Bennett, as
nothing of this sort is recorded as occurring in the discharges of
patients of other observers; certainly in mine there was no parasitic
development.The presence of it in their cases may then be fairly
regarded as accidental, or at least unessential.Habershon regarded ovarian diseases and painful menstruation in the
female, and prostatic diseases in the male, as exciting causes.SYMPTOMS.--The most characteristic symptoms disclosing the presence of
pseudo-membranous enteritis are those arising from derangements of the
digestive organs.They are, in the beginning, vague and irregular in
occurrence, or so over-veiled by associated disorders of the
genito-urinary and nervous systems that their nature and import often
escape recognition until, weeks, and even months, of fruitless
medication addressed to these secondary phenomena having been expended,
the disease assumes such severity and presents such a complex of
peculiar symptoms that it no longer eludes identification.The disease rarely starts as an acute affection; sometimes it is
subacute, but in the great majority of cases its course is chronic.Its
initiation is marked with symptoms of gastro-intestinal
disturbances--irregularity of the bowels, constipation and diarrhoea
alternately; and dyspeptic annoyance of one sort or another--capricious
appetite, nausea or vomiting, and pyrosis, usually increased by liquid
diet.In Dunhill's case there was almost daily vomiting of mucus and
pus streaked with blood, and occasionally pure blood.This prominence
of gastric derangement supplies an explanation why Todd conferred upon
the disease the title of follicular dyspepsia.There is a sense of discomfort, soreness, or rawness of the abdomen,
especially along the line of the colon, and in two of my cases the
rectum was tender and raw, which augmented to decided pain in sitting
or riding, and the abdominal muscles were tense; a feeling of heat or
burning in the bowels often occurs, and almost always more or less
lassitude and mental depression.These symptoms aggravate, especially
upon indiscretions in diet, exposure to wet, or indeed under any sort
of enervative influences, at irregular intervals.Their persistence
finally induces grave disorders of nutrition, marked by the blood
becoming poor and thin, by sluggish {766} circulation and local
congestions in the pelvic and abdominal viscera, and loss of strength
and flesh.Yet certain patients seem to retain their flesh for a long
time, as I have seen, after suffering several years from the disease.The depression of vital powers is still further manifested in a small,
slow, soft pulse and a temperature running below the normal standard.The tongue is usually moist, pale, and flabby, and coated with a
pearl-white or yellowish-white coating; sometimes, however, it is raw,
red, tender, and fissured, or patchy from exfoliation of the mucous
coating.The gums and cheeks are usually pale and bloodless, and often
the seat of small roundish painful ulcers, which occasionally invade
the palate and throat.Grantham[13] says that ulceration of a
phagedaenic kind sometimes forms on the tonsils.The complexion usually
assumes a muddy or flavescent tint, which during the attack may deepen
to a jaundiced hue.At other times it presents a transparent or waxy
appearance.The skin is dry and furfy, sometimes cold and clammy, or, from
over-action of the sebaceous glands, greasy.There is a disposition,
especially on the chest, neck, and face, to papular eruptions or even
phlegmonous or carbuncular inflammation.The urine is high- and loaded with abundant phosphates, which in
cooling precipitate as a heavy deposit.The bladder is often irritable,
and discharges more or less mucus.According to Grantham,[14] patients
occasionally pass urine with evident traces of albumen, and seldom
containing a normal quantity of phosphates.On an increase in fever or
mental excitement a larger quantity than natural of the lithate of
ammonium is found; frequently the mucous membrane of the bladder is
found thickened in these cases.The characteristic symptom, however, of this disease is the periodical
formation and discharge of mucous exudates varying in physical
appearances and frequency.The discharge may occur daily, with every
stool, or at irregular intervals--a week, month, or longer--but usually
in from twelve to fifteen days.The recurrence may be precipitated by
irregularity in diet, exposure to wet and cold, or by excesses of any
sort.The paroxysm is marked by tormina or severe pain, which may
resemble that of colic or that of the passage of a biliary calculus,
extending down the thighs or to the bladder, in the latter case
sometimes causing retention, requiring the use of the catheter.The
pain is usually referred to some part of the large intestine.In
certain cases the paroxysm is announced by chills radiating from some
point in the abdomen or even from other parts of the body.After the paroxysm has endured two, three, or more days--usually a
week--membranous exudates, either with a spontaneous or with an
artificial movement of the bowels, are voided; after which there is a
gradual assuagement of the local and general symptoms, but the patient
experiences a sense of exhaustion or lassitude, and the tenderness of
the abdomen and the irregularity of the bowels usually persist.During the attack there is anorexia, but in the intervals the appetite
remains fairly good, and the alvine discharges may assume quite a
natural condition.In the course of the disease there is more or less disturbance in the
functions of the nervous system.During the paroxysm, when the {767}
sufferings are severe, the cast of symptoms running through the case is
of a decidedly hypochondriacal type.At times, with the expulsion of
the exudates and succeeding respite from suffering, there often occurs
a mental rebound which lifts the patient from the slough of despair to
the most hopeful anticipations of future health and happiness.In one
of my cases this transition was remarkable.This hysterical type is
common enough, and the irritability of the nervous system is still
further manifested in the occurrence of irregular contractions of
various groups of the voluntary muscles, as shown in hysterical
tetanus, general convulsions, or chorea in children, or by paralyses of
motion.Copeland[15] reports a case of a lady in whom this disease was
complicated with the severest symptoms of hysteria, occasionally
amounting to catalepsy.The paroxysms of pain recurred at intervals
between four and six weeks, followed or attended by the discharge of
large quantities of false membrane in pieces, and sometimes in perfect
tubes.The menstrual flow was painful and irregular, accompanied with
shreds of false membrane--not, however, contemporaneous with those of
the intestine.The sensory nerves are often deranged, for in some cases
there is paraesthesia--anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia--in limited areas
of the skin.There is more or less headache, neuralgic pains in this or
that nerve, or in several at the same time.[Footnote 15: _Dictionary of Medicine_, vol.The special senses do not escape; they manifest various forms of
functional derangement.In one of my cases there were constant buzzing
in the ears and perversion of the sense of smell, and in another the
vision was thought impaired and the services of an oculist sought.The uterine functions are always involved in greater or less degree.The menstruation is difficult and painful, and occasionally accompanied
with membranous discharges.In one of my cases there was a uterine
exudate, though the menopause had occurred several years before.Leucorrhoea and cervical inflammation are common.PATHOLOGY.--Despite the fact that the disease in question, without
being very frequent, is far from rare, little light has been shed upon
its pathology.Indeed, even its individuality as an independent and
distinct affection has been contested, although it is marked by a
complex of symptoms as peculiar and characteristic as those of any
other disease in the nosology.There are those who maintain that the disease consists essentially in
an inflammatory condition of the intestinal mucous membrane, either of
the ordinary or of some specific type, croupous or diphtheritic.Copeland says the formation of the membranes depends upon a latent and
prolonged state of inflammation extending along a very large portion,
sometimes the greater part, of the intestinal canal, as is evinced by
the quantity thrown off.Valleix[16] dismisses the subject summarily
with the delivery of the oracular judgment that the greater number of
cases of this disease are dysenteric, and the remainder diphtheritic.Habershon is in full accord with this view, having, as he says, seen
these membranous exudates "follow severe disease of the intestines of a
dysenteric character, and sometimes associated with a state of chronic
congestion of the liver, and often perpetuated by the presence of
hemorrhoids, polypoid {768} growths, etc."Wilks and Clark,[17] after a
full examination of the enteric exudates submitted to them, concluded
that they are true casts of the large intestines produced by chronic
inflammatory action of the mucous membrane and subsequent exudation.Conjectures have been ventured as to the exact anatomical structure in
which the process occurs.Thus, Todd[18] says that the proximate cause
of the disease is dependent upon a morbid condition of the intestinal
mucous follicles.Golding-Bird[19] holds similar language.He says: "It
is probable that the follicles are the principal seat of the disease,
for we know that they sometimes secrete a dense mucus differing little
in physical qualities from coagulated albumen or even fibrin."Livedey[20] attributed the process to a morbid secretion into the
mucous crypts.[Footnote 16: _Guide du Medecine practicien_, vol.[Footnote 18: _Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine_, vol.[Footnote 19: _Guy's Hospital Reports_.][Footnote 20: _L'Union medicale_, 1868.]Among those believing in its croupous nature was Powell, who assumed
the character of the inflammation to be specific, and the exudate of
the same nature and formed in the same manner as that of ordinary
croup.This was the view entertained by Cruveilhier and Trousseau and
other French authors.Good was misled in a similar manner, as shown by
his statement that the exudation bears a striking resemblance to the
fibrous exudation thrown forth from the trachea in croup.He says,
however, that it is discharged in longer, firmer, and more compact
tubes.Serres,[21] in a dissertation upon pseudo-membranous colitis,
confounds the exudate with that of thrush, muguet, and infective
dysentery.Laboulbene,[22] a later writer, also remarks that there are
found in many treatises and in periodical literature a great number of
occurrences of false membranes in the dejecta.Most of these cases are
referable to dysentery, to muguet, hydatids, etc., but there remain a
certain number which are owing to different inflammatory and
non-diphtheritic affections of the digestive tube.[Footnote 21: _These de Paris_, No.[Footnote 22: _Recherches cliniques et anatomiques sur les Affections
pseudo-membraneuse_, Paris, 1861.]Whitehead, in summing up his conclusions respecting the nature of the
disease, compares it with dermic inflammation.He says: "The mucous
membrane (intestinal), like the skin (and is not the one looked upon as
an inversion of the other?), is prone under certain conditions in
certain constitutions to develop products unnatural to its functions.It is not natural for the skin to produce eczema, neither is it natural
for mucous surfaces to produce mucus in a concrete form; that the
proximate cause of the symptoms referable to this disease is the
hypersecretion and accumulation of mucus on the free surface of mucous
membranes; such accumulations sheathe and prevent the healthy
performance of the functions natural to the part, and thus induce
immediate and remote results, the effect of such suppressed functions;
that this hypersecretion indicates a want of balance between
nerve-force and germinal matter, and that the nerve-force is perverted
by irritation."Simpson held similar views, and regarded the disease as a chronic
pellicular or eruptive inflammation of the mucous lining of the
bowels.[23] Other observers have been inclined to ignore the
inflammatory nature of the disease, at least as a primary condition,
and have sought the proximate cause in some as yet undefined
derangement of the nervous {769} system.Thus, Clark does not regard
the membranous exudates as the products of inflammation, properly so
called--that is, of capillary blood-stasis which has preceded their
formation--as the characteristic of such exudates is that they contain
fibrin.He says the abnormal cell-forms present arise in some other way
than by free cell-development out of an exuded blastema.Good[24]
asserts its dependence upon what he calls a "peculiar irritability of
the villous membranes of the large intestines, which in consequence
secrete an effusion of coagulating fibrin--fibrin mixed with
albumen--instead of secreting mucus, occasionally accompanied with some
degree of chronic inflammation."[Footnote 24: _Study of Medicine_, _op.cit._]

Also, DaCosta doubts whether the disease is originally inflammatory at
all."Where inflammation," he says, "occurs, is it not secondary rather
than primary, the result rather than the cause?""Is not the true
trouble in the nervous system, in the nerves presiding over secretion
and nutrition in the abdominal viscera?"Bennett and Byford represent the opinions of a very small minority who
regard the disease as simply an expression of uterine derangement.MORBID ANATOMY.--As none of the cases coming under my observation
terminated fatally, no opportunity was offered to me of making personal
investigation into the anatomical changes occurring in membranous
enteritis.Such opportunities have been so rarely met with that,
indeed, it may be said that the nature of these changes is wholly
unknown.Simpson alludes to a case of phthisis in which the patient had passed
large quantities of "membranous crusts or tubes," and in which the
mucous membrane of the colon was covered with an immense number of
small spots of a clear white color, or vesicles, which, when punctured,
discharged a small quantity of clear fluid; and also refers to the case
of Wright, in which the mucous membrane of the colon and of the lower
portion of the small intestine was studded everywhere with a
thickly-set papular eruption.My endoscopic examinations revealed, in the living subject, the
intestinal mucous membrane of a red, verging into a scarlet color,
thickened, and denuded of epithelium in patches of varying extent.This
condition does not always invade the ampulla of the rectum, but with
the long tube I am in the habit of using it was possible in all my
cases to reach a point where it existed.The extent of diseased surface
can only be conjectured by an inspection of the exudates and by
abdominal palpation.In most cases the exudate is restricted to the large intestines--colon
and rectum--and often to a circumscribed portion of them; but in rare
cases its length and quantity would seem to indicate that extensive
portions of the surface are covered.One of the most remarkable cases
recorded is that of a woman forty years old who had been sick for five
years with gastro-intestinal derangement.Suddenly the case became
acute, and after much suffering she passed membranous exudates three
millimeters in thickness and many centimeters long, weighing in all
three kilograms.[25]

[Footnote 25: _Recueil de Memoires de Medecine, de Chirurgie, et de
Pharmacie militaires_, tome xxxvii.Kaempf[26] gives another case, in which the length of the membranes
{770} discharged was sevenfold greater than the stature of the patient.In Dunhill's[27] case the patient had suffered from this disease for a
long period, and during two years passed many yards of perfect
cylindrical shape, many of them several feet in length, and
sufficiently coherent to permit of their being handled, held up, etc.In one of my cases a perfect cylinder three-quarters of a yard long was
voided.Laboulbene[28] describes the gastro-intestinal false membrane as thin,
soft, and granular, of a more or less yellow color, slightly adherent
to the mucous membrane, and when stripped off forming a yellow
pultaceous mass.He says it is first deposited in small, irregular,
sparsely-scattered patches, located on the summits of the intestinal
folds; afterward these patches increase, and cover the folds entirely
and almost the whole calibre of the intestinal canal.The mucous
membrane, he remarks, beneath the deposit is greatly inflamed.Powell believes that at times the deposit extends as high as the
duodenum, his opinion being solely based upon the clinical features of
the disease.In the first of his cases the membrane was found in
perfect tubes, some of them full half a yard in length, and certainly
sufficient in quantity, he says, to have lined the whole intestinal
canal.In examining the membranes it is always best to float them from the
fecal or other foreign material by passing the discharges in a clean
vessel containing water.Their physical characters can then be readily
studied.They are best preserved in a 10 per cent.The exudate consists usually of a single lamina, but at various points
in certain cases several superposed laminae may be observed, enclosing
between them particles of undigested food of various kinds.In most
cases the superficial layers are more opaque, drier, less elastic, and
friable than the deeper.The configuration of the exudate varies greatly.The more common
variety is that occurring in loose, transparent, jelly-like masses,
like the white of an egg or glue, tinged often with various hues of
yellow.In three of my cases I noticed also the frequent occurrence of
a thin, serous, yellow discharge.In some cases the discharge resembles
pieces of macaroni, tallow, or wax; in others it assumes a shreddy or
ribbon-like form; and in a still rarer class it is tubular, being an
exact reprint of the surfaces from which detached.These tubular pieces
are, however, more or less torn and broken into smaller fragments of an
inch or two in length when discharged.Its thickness also varies: sometimes it does not exceed that of the
thinnest film, and at others it is a quarter of an inch or more.Its consistence ranges from that degree of loose aggregation that
permits elongation into stringy, breaking masses when fished up from
the water in which it floats, to a firmness and tenacity that will
enable it to be handled without fear of breakage.It is usually yellowish-white,
but this is often modified by tints dependent upon admixture with
extraneous matters from the intestinal canal--biliary coloring, blood
from the rupture of the vessels beneath the exudate, or with blood and
pus.The surfaces of the membranes are ordinarily smooth and uniform, but
sometimes reticulated.Certain observers have described the outer {771}
surface of the tubular exudate as uniformly smooth, and the inner as
broken and flaky at some points, at others ragged and flocculent, and
in many places thrown into shallow folds, lying in some situations
across, but chiefly along, the axis of the gut.The microscopic characters of the exudate are pretty uniform.Wilks and
Clark[29] describe the surface of the tubes, examined with a linear
magnifying power of forty diameters, as exhibiting the appearance of a
gelatinous membraniform matrix traversed by a coarse network of opaque
yellow lines, studded at their points of intersection by similarly
 rounded masses.From the larger network proceeds a smaller
secondary network, and in the recesses of this were found, at close and
regular intervals, well-defined round or oval openings, with elevated
margins, resembling in size and appearance the mouths of the follicles
of the great gut.With higher powers the exudate was found in many
cases to consist of a structureless basement membrane, which in certain
points showed a fibrous appearance, owing doubtless to the presence of
filaments of mucin.Numerous irregular granular cells, as well as
granules from the breaking up of these cells, thickly studded the
surface of the membrane.In the specimens of Wilks and Clark the
surface, besides being marked by the opaque yellow lines and dots,
presented various foreign matters, such as bile-pigment, earthy and
fatty granules, portions of husks of seed, gritty tissues of a pear, a
peculiar form of elastic tissue, stellate vegetable hairs, and a
mucedinous fungus.Clark, in describing the fibres found between the
layers of the exudates, says that they exhibited a very distinct and
regular transverse striation, approaching in character that found in
the ligamentum nuchae of the giraffe.Quekett and Brooke have met with
the same fibres in the feces.The transverse division depends probably
upon beginning decay.The division is sometimes so distinct and
complete as to lead, according to Beale,[30] to their confounding with
confervoid growths.Farre[31] actually describes the formation as of a
confervoid character.[Footnote 30: _The Microscope in Medicine_, p.Here and there, in my specimens, were observed scattered epithelial
cells which were occasionally gathered in patches.Small <DW52> masses
of irregular shape, doubtless of fecal origin, were also noticed.The
cells imbedded in the matrix, according to the above-quoted observers,
consisted of two kinds--one more or less spherical, the other more or
less cylindrical.In size the spherical cells varied from 1/2000 to
1/800 of an inch in diameter.The smaller cells had no distinct
cell-walls.Some of the larger cells were filled with fat-granules, and
represented granular cells; others had a single or double vesicular
nucleus; a few were acuminated at two opposite points and somewhat
compressed.All the other cells possessed demonstrable cell-walls.The
cylindrical cells resembled in their general characters those which
normally coat the mucous membrane of the larger gut, but they were much
more elongated, compressed, and firmly matted together.Many of the
more elongated cells were constricted in the middle, and exhibited a
nucleus on each side of the constriction.The more or less spherical
cells occupied the attached, and the cylindrical cells the free,
surface of the membranous tubes.The perforations in the matrix were of uniform size and appearance,
{772} surrounded by elevated margins formed of closely-grouped
cylindrical cells, and led to two kinds of pits--one short and
flask-shaped, the other long and uniformly cylindrical.The
flask-shaped pits were about one-tenth of an inch in diameter and
distinctly hollow.The wall of each pit was made up of one or two
layers of subspheroidal cells, held together by an amorphous stroma.A
few of these follicles contained a deposit which was opaque in situ,
and which when broken up was found to consist of large flattened
nuclear cells, analogous to those met with in epithelial growths.The cylindrical pits were also for the most part hollow, about
one-sixteenth of a line in length and one-thirty-first of a line in
breadth.These walls, devoid of membrane, were composed of small, more
or less spherical cells in various stages of development, imbedded in a
gelatinous matrix.In examining the chemical characters of the specimens obtained in my
cases the membranes were thoroughly washed, when they were nearly as
colorless as the water in which they floated.They were drained on a
sieve, and presented a gelatinous appearance, much like the white of an
egg.Their specific gravity was about that of distilled water.When
treated with strong alcohol, the membranes shrank and assumed a
striated appearance.Chemical tests of tincture of guaiacum, peroxide
of hydrogen, and others failed to show the presence of fibrin or
albumen.Treated with ether, globules of fatty matter were obtained,
which were identified by their microscopical characters and by their
reaction with osmic acid.By boiling the liquid in which the membranes
had been soaked it became faintly hazy, indicating a trace only of
albumen.Faint evidence of the presence of this body was also presented
by picric acid and Mehu's test.Treated with a weak solution of caustic
potassa and heat, the membrane dissolved, leaving a little haziness.The liquid was then filtered, and exactly neutralized with acetic acid,
and plumbic acetate added, when a copious precipitate was formed.Mercuric chloride and potassic ferrocyanide failed to produce this
effect.From these and other tests used the conclusion was reached that
these membranes were composed essentially of mucin.Both the microscopical and chemical characters of the exudates of the
disease under consideration show that they are widely different in
nature from those of other diseases.They are evidently a production of
the muciparous glands (follicles of Lieberkuhn) of the intestinal
canal, and consist essentially of mucin.Perroud[32] concluded from his
analysis that they contain a small quantity of albumen, but are
principally formed of the same substance as that which enters into the
composition of the epidermis.The exudates of other diseases of the
alimentary mucous membrane contain albumen and fibrin, as well as
molecular or homogeneous filaments.The ordinary croupous exudate,
according to Cornil and Ranvier, always contains filaments of fibrin,
sometimes mucin and pus-corpuscles mingled with the cellular
constituents, which vary in character with the locality of the
inflammation.The filaments form a reticulum in the meshes of which are
contained the other elements.[Footnote 32: _Journal de Medecine de Lyon_, 1864.]Diphtheritic exudates, as shown by Lehmann,[33] consist of fibrin, a
large {773} quantity of fatty matter, and 4 per cent.of earthy
phosphates, while its structure is made up of epithelial cells united
together, which, becoming infiltrated with an albuminous substance and
gradually losing their nuclei and walls, are finally converted into
homogeneous branching masses.The cells of these masses are liable to
undergo fibrinous degeneration.The inflammation determining the
exudate is not confined to the conglomerate glands, but involves all
the textural elements of the part affected, and the material of the
membrane originates from the capillary disturbance in them.[Footnote 33: _Lehrbuch der Physiolog.Chemie_, Leipzig, 1855.]Andrew Clark[34] states that he has observed in his studies of exuded
blastema, the product of diseased action in mucous membranes, three
varieties.The first is clear, jelly-like, and imperfectly membranous.The second is yellowish, semi-opaque, flaky, and usually membranous.The third is yellowish-white, dense, opaque, distinctly membranous,
tough, and rather firmly adherent to the subjacent surface.The first
contains only the merest trace of albumen, and no fibrin; the second
contains an abundance of albumen, and no fibrin; the third contains
both albumen and fibrin in abundance, the latter in a fibrillated form.Yet it is to be noticed that in
the first variety there is no evidence of transudation or exudation; in
the second, no evidence of a true exudation; and that in the third, in
which the existence of a true inflammatory exudation is undeniable, the
only additional structural element present is fibre.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of membranous enteritis can never in its
advance, and rarely in its early stages, present much difficulty.Its
chronic course, irregular exacerbations, lack of febrile excitement,
the persistent derangement of the intestinal canal, the mental
depression, the gradual impairment of health, the various visceral
complications, and, lastly and chiefly, the peculiar character of the
alvine discharges,--stamp the disease with an individuality entirely
its own.The mucous discharges of certain forms of chronic diarrhoea and the
membranous discharges of infective dysentery are all so different in
physical character, and are associated with such a different complex of
general symptoms, that they cannot be confounded with those of the
diseases in question.The peculiar irritative quickness of the pulse of
ordinary enteritis, according to Powell and Good, suffices to
differentiate this disease from membranous enteritis.The peculiarities
of the physical and chemical properties of these exudates, already
fully dwelt upon, not only distinguish them from those of the above
diseases, but also from such dejecta as may contain fragments of
undigested connective tissue, of hydatids, or of worms.The flakes of
mucus discharged from the bowels in protracted constipation, fissura
ani, and in the later stages of cirrhosis of the liver are composed of
mucus in which are found imbedded epithelial cells from the colon and
mucus-corpuscles.The microscope will also reveal the character of the
fatty discharges that may be associated with diseases of the pancreas,
liver, and duodenum.The mucous flakes of cholera stools are composed
of masses of intestinal epithelium mixed with amorphous and granular
matter, crystals of different substances, and, according to Davaine, of
parasitic forms, particularly the Circomonas hominis.{774} Membranous casts from the upper part of the digestive track are,
in rare cases, passed by the bowels.One of the most curious instances
of this sort is reported by Villerme:[35] A woman swallowed a
tablespoonful of nitric acid, and seventy days afterward a long
membranous exudate, one or two lines thick and of a brown color, was
discharged, which corresponded in form with the oesophagus and stomach.[Footnote 35: _Dictionnaire des Sciences medicales_, tome xxxii.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of the disease as regards life is not
unfavorable, but as regards permanent restoration to health and
strength the case is entirely different.Theden[36] and Hoffman[37]
have, however, stated that the disease is not an unfrequent cause of
sudden death.[Footnote 36: _Remarques et Experiences_, tome ii.]Abercrombie[38] records a case of death from phthisis complicated with
this disease, and Wright another case in which the patient died in an
extreme state of marasmus.The acute and subacute forms are more
amenable to treatment, and the chances are correspondingly greater of
permanent recovery, though in all cases there is a strong tendency to
relapse.The chronic forms may almost be enrolled among the opprobria
medicorum when once they have made deep inroads upon nutrition and the
vital powers, and produced that condition named by Todd the pituitous
cachexia (cachexia pituitosa).These cases may, however, be alleviated
by judicious treatment, diet, and climatic changes, but repeated
relapses may be expected as the rule under slight exciting causes or
even without apparent cause.Patients under these circumstances drag
out a life of valetudinarianism, but it may be cut short at any time by
the supervention of some intercurrent disease, as phthisis, renal
degeneration, etc., or, according to Grantham, atrophy of the
intestines.Broca[39] records two cases of this disease, one of which
lasted ten and the other fifteen years.Three of my cases have endured
over six years.[Footnote 39: _Bulletin de la Societe Anat.TREATMENT.--The treatment of membranous enteritis embraces medical and
hygienic measures.The medical means have for their object, first, the
removal of the membranous exudation when it has once formed; and,
second, to correct the conditions upon which its formation depends by
improving nutrition and invigorating the nervous system.The severe
sufferings of the paroxysms are greatly alleviated and the duration of
this stage cut short by freely emptying the bowels.The best means to
do this is by the injection of hot water with the long elastic bougie
three or four times a day, and to assist this with laxatives.Instead
of water, solutions of potassa, soda, and lime-water are preferred by
some practitioners.As a rule, the enemata cause considerable
discomfort, but in the end are followed by improvement in the condition
of the bowels.The best laxative is emulsion of castor oil, but
occasionally a mercurial, guarded by the extract of belladonna, will
furnish more marked relief.Powell and Copeland say that they have
employed with decided advantage a purgative consisting of the compound
infusion of gentian and infusion of senna, to which were added ten or
twenty minims of liquor potassae.This was repeated, so that four
stools in the twenty-four hours were obtained.Clark preferred to
regulate the bowels, when needed, with rhubarb, soda, and {775} ipecac,
conjoined or not, as required, with mercury and chalk.Good recommends
four grains of Plummer's pill every night, and the bowels kept open by
two drachms of sublimed sulphur daily.It should always be borne in
mind that all active or irritating purgatives are harmful.The bowels
by this treatment will not only be disembarrassed of the membranous
exudates, but also of any fecal collection the retention of which would
surely cause irritation, as occasionally happens even when there is an
apparent diarrhoea.This condition may be easily determined by
abdominal palpation.The relief from pain procured by free evacuation
of the intestine will be enhanced by the employment of hot fomentations
to the abdomen.Despite these means, its severity may, however, demand
the administration of narcotics.The best form will be a hypodermic
injection of a sixth or a quarter of a grain of morphia; enemata of
starch and laudanum are also beneficial.Burrows mentions a case in
which he succeeded in allaying nervous irritation by the nightly use of
thirty drops of laudanum.The patient noticed that the habitual
constipation was increased when the accustomed narcotic was omitted.Bromide of potassium in large doses long continued will also be found
useful for the same purpose.During the intervals of the paroxysms local medication of the bowels
and medical and hygienic measures should be had recourse to to prevent
the re-formation of the exudates by modifying the vital activities of
the intestinal mucous membrane and by restoring the general tone of the
constitutional powers.For local treatment the nitrate of silver,
sulphate of zinc, the sulphate of copper dissolved in glycerin, the
tincture of iodine, and carbolic acid cannot be over-prized.From five
to ten grains of the metallic salts, fifteen drops of tincture of
iodine, ten of the acid, administered through the long rubber tube, are
suitable doses to begin with.I am also in the habit of using stronger
solutions by mopping it on to the bowel through the endoscopic tube.Kaempf made frequent and large injections of decoctions of various
plants--saponaria, taraxacum, etc.--which he imagined possessed
dissolvent and resolvent virtues.Cumming[40] speaks highly of the
efficacy of electricity.Gazette_, 3d Series, vol.For the purpose of improving the general health the preparations of
iron are advisable, of which the best are the tincture of the chloride,
pernitrate, pyrophosphate, lactate, and potassio-tartrate.Habershon
advises infusions of the bitter tonics with hydrocyanic and
nitro-muriatic acid.I have found a combination of these acids with
henbane and infusion of serpentaria useful.I also employ hot solutions
of the latter acid as a local bath over the abdominal region, applied
with a large sponge.Clark speaks favorably of the extract of nux
vomica and astringent remedies.Simpson praises the oleo-resins under
the form of pitch pills and tar, while Clark and others laud copaiba
and turpentine.Good advises the copaiba to be given by enema when it
cannot be borne by the stomach.The alterative effects of small doses of arsenic, corrosive sublimate,
sulphate of copper, etc.Grantham in
the early stages of the complaint advises the use of ten grains of
iodide of potassium combined with one-quarter of a grain of morphia at
bed-time.He {776} also strongly urges the use of cod-liver oil, which,
he says, improves the strength and increases the flesh, lessens the
spasmodic pains, but does not check the discharges.Counter-irritation of the abdominal region with tincture of iodine, fly
blisters, mustard, etc.Dunhill
kept a blister open for six months without any good results.The mineral waters of Pyrmont, Harrogate, and Carlsbad have been found
serviceable; the latter, Henoch[41] says, should be preferred before
all.[Footnote 41: _Klinik der Unterleub.The case will amend more speedily and surely by the adoption of those
sanitary measures, as regards clothing, diet, bathing, exercise, and
change of climate, which have such important influences upon health.The healthy performance of the functions of the skin is of such
paramount necessity in maintaining that of the intestinal canal that
the patient should endeavor to avoid any exposure likely to lead to
checked perspiration, and should use flannel underwear and stimulate
the skin by friction with the hand or the flesh-brush.The diet should
be graded to the ability of the stomach to digest and the body to
assimilate.Our chief reliance will be upon milk, plain or peptonized,
eggs, and beef given in the various forms of acceptable preparations,
so as not to impair the tone of the stomach nor clog the appetite by
sameness.Such vegetables and fruits as agree with the patient may be
allowed.I have tried exclusive diets of milk, farinacea, and meat
without marked benefit.All stimulants, tea, and coffee should as a
rule be interdicted.Systematic exercise in the open air and change of climate to a cool,
dry, bracing atmosphere will contribute to comfortable existence, if
not lead to recovery.{777}

DYSENTERY.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.DEFINITION.--Dysentery is the clinical expression of a disease of the
large intestine, of specific and non-specific (catarrhal) origin and
form; characterized by hyperaemia, infiltration, and necrosis
(ulceration) of its mucous membrane; distinguished by discharges of
mucus, blood, pus, and tissue-debris; and attended with griping and
expulsive pains (tormina and tenesmus).ETYMOLOGY.--The name is compounded of the two Greek words [Greek: dys
enteron], which, though untranslatable literally into English, have
long since received the exact Latin equivalent, difficultas
intestinorum.With appropriate alteration the same name is still
employed in every civilized language in the common as well as the
classical description of the disease.The French synonym, colite,
locates the anatomical seat of the disease, while the German Ruhr and
the English flux express one of its cardinal symptoms, the frequency
(flow) of the evacuations.HISTORY.--Ancient.--In its clinical history dysentery is one of the
oldest known diseases, the name being found in common use before the
time of Hippocrates, as in the often-quoted passage from Herodotus (443
B.C.), who relates that it and the plague reduced the army of Xerxes on
the desert plains of Thessaly.Fayrer informs us that in the ancient system of Hindoo medicine of the
Ayur Veda, and in the commentaries of Dhanwantari, Charaka, and
Sussutra, which carry us back nearly three thousand years, and in later
Sanskrit writers, dysentery is described by the name of atisar, under
two forms--amapake, or acute, and pakistar, or chronic; these again are
subdivided into six varieties, ascribed by those ancient sages to
changes in air, bile, phlegm, food, or to perturbations of the emotions
and passions.makes frequent reference to the disease, the
nature of which he regards as a descent of the humors from the brain."Men of a phlegmatic temperament are liable to have dysenteries," he
says, "and women also, from the humidity of their bodies, the phlegm
descending downward from the brain.""The disease is caused," he says more exactly in another place, "by the
overflow of phlegm and bile to the veins of the belly, producing
ulceration and erosion of the intestine."In his country, at least, it
seemed most to prevail in spring, but it was clearly connected with the
heat and moisture of this season in Greece--prime factors everywhere in
the genesis of the disease: "For when suffocating heat sets in all of a
{778} sudden while the earth is moistened by the vernal showers and by
the south wind, the heat is necessarily doubled from the earth, which
is thus soaked by the rain and heated by a burning sun, while at the
same time men's bellies are not in an orderly state, nor is the brain
properly dried."Of the prognosis he observes with great acumen,
"Dysenteries when they set in with fever... or with inflammation of
the liver and hypochondrium or of the stomach,... all these are bad.But such dysenteries as are of a beneficial nature and are attended
with blood and scrapings of the bowels cease on the seventh or
thirtieth day, or within that period.In such cases even a pregnant
woman may recover and not suffer abortion;" whereas, "dysentery if it
commence with black bile is mortal."Galen comments upon this statement
that such a discharge is as incurable as cancer.The practitioner of
our day will interpret this assertion, which was repeated with singular
unanimity by all the writers of antiquity, with the belief that the
black bile was blood, and that such cases really were cancers.Indeed,
Paulus AEgineta distinctly says, "Dysentery arising from black bile is
necessarily fatal, as indicating an ulcerated cancer."Thus, although dysentery is among the oldest of the known maladies, and
was recognized then as now by the same symptoms, the disease was by no
means closely defined or differentiated in ancient times.As Ackermann
long ago pointed out, many other affections were included under the
term dysentery, and some of the symptoms of true dysentery, notably the
tenesmus, were raised to the dignity of distinct diseases.The gravity of the so-called lotura carnea, the fleshy stools, was
fully appreciated by Hippocrates, as is evidenced by the remark that
"if in a person ill of dysentery substances resembling flesh be
discharged from the bowels, it is a mortal symptom."Fleshy masses,
[Greek: xysmata], scrapings of the guts (originally epidermic
exfoliations from the bodies of gladiators, used in pills as a tonic),
were frequently alluded to by the older writers, more especially by
Aretaeus, in description of the discharges of dysentery.Hippocrates
was also aware of the fact that dysentery may be a secondary as well as
a primary malady."One may expect," he says in speaking of the victims
of gangrene, "that such patients will be attacked with dysentery; for
dysentery usually supervenes in cases of mortification and of
hemorrhage from wounds."Finally, Hippocrates recognized the effects of
emesis in relief of the disease with the remark in one of his aphorisms
that a spontaneous vomiting cures dysentery.Celsus (25 B.C.-45 A.D.), the great encyclopaedist, whose works
"constitute the greatest literary monument since the days of
Hippocrates," compiles all the information obtained up to his time; but
it is plain as regards dysentery, though he defines it in terms that
might stand in a modern text-book, that he has nothing new to add to
the knowledge of the Hippocratic school.He named the disease from one
of its most prominent symptoms, tormina (tenesmus he considered a
separate affection), speaks of the stools as being mixed with mucus and
fleshy masses, and in its treatment especially enjoins rest, "as all
motion proves injurious to the ulcer."), of all the authors of antiquity, wrote the most
perfect and at the same time the most picturesque account of the morbid
anatomy and symptomatology of this disease.The gross appearance of the
ulcers in the intestine and the common character of the discharges he
{779} describes with the accuracy of the modern pathologist and the
ardor of the true clinician.He speaks of the superficial, the
deep-seated, the irritable, and the callous ulcer.There is, he says,
"another larger species of ulcers, with thick edges, rough, unequal,
callous, as we would call a knot of wood; these are difficult to cure,
for they do not readily cicatrize, and the cicatrices are easily
dissolved."Their tendency to arrest and renewal and their general and
local effects he notices at length."There may be a postponement of
their spreading for a long time," he says, "various changes taking
place in the ulcers, some subsiding and others swelling up like waves
in the sea.Such is the course of the ulcers; but if nature stand out
and the physician co-operate, the spreading may indeed be stopped, and
a fatal termination is not apprehended, but the intestines remain hard
and callous, and the recovery of such cases is protracted."Vivid
descriptions he gives of the stools: "Sometimes they are like chopped
tallow, sometimes merely mucus, prurient, small, round, pungent,
causing frequent dejections and a desire not without a pleasurable
sensation, but with very scanty evacuations."Again, they are "fetid
like a mortification;" composed of "food now undigested, as if only
masticated by voracious teeth,... the dejection being discharged with
much flatulence and noise; it has the appearance of being larger than
its actual amount."attempted to correct the pathology of his
contemporaries, who considered all bloody discharges dysenteric.There
are four distinct varieties of bloody stools, he claims, only one of
which, that due to ulceration of the intestine, deserves to be called
dysentery.The bilious stool he derived from melancholy, and the fleshy
stool from disease of the liver.But, though Galen regarded the
presence of blood as a necessity, he was well aware of the fact that
the stools contained ingredients other than blood.It was Galen who
first used the word scybala ([Greek: schybala], feces) to express the
small, solid masses of excrementitious matter often voided with the
stools.In his treatment of the disease he made much use of the various
drying earths, the Samian, Lemnian, Armenian, the sources of which he
made long journeys to visit in order to become better acquainted with
their properties, and which are better substituted in our day by
bismuth, chalk, magnesia, and the carbonate of iron.It is the
distinguished merit of Galen to have called special attention to the
anatomical seat of the disease.Ulceration of the intestine he claimed
as the very essence of the disease, and all the physicians of his day,
he maintained, regarded as dysenteric only such cases as are attended
with ulceration.Galen was the exponent of the flower of Grecian, we might say of
ancient, medicine.With very few exceptions, the later writers, if they
do not obscure the original text with their speculations, are content
to simply paraphrase the observations of their predecessors, and the
subsequent contributions to the ancient history of dysentery may be
briefly summed up in a few additional notes.Coelius Aurelianus (400 A.D.)adopted the humoralistic doctrine of
Hippocrates and regarded dysentery as an intestinal rheumatism
(catarrh) with ulceration.He seems to have been the first author to
recognize the cardinal fact that dysentery, notwithstanding the number
of its stools, should be classed with the diseases which constipate the
bowels, or, as it {780} was centuries later aptly put by Stoll, "ut
hanc morbis adnumeres alvum potius occludentibus," and he blames
Erasistratus for using nothing but astringents, whereas many cases of
dysentery require laxatives.It is worthy of note that Coelius
Aurelianus ascribes the first use of opium in the treatment of
dysentery to Diocles of Carystus (300 B.C.), who administered the juice
of poppies combined with galls.By the time of Galen opium was so
freely used in the treatment of the fluxes as to call for protest
against its abuse.Alexander of Tralles (575 A.D.)is often credited as having been the
first to locate the disease in the large intestine.The truth is, he
suggested various rules by which the seat of the disease, whether in
the small or large intestine, might be definitely determined.But none
of these rules--the seat of the pain, for instance, whether above or
below the umbilicus, and the interval of time between the pain and
discharges, whether long or short--possess the least diagnostic value
or add to the attempts in this direction of previous writers--Aretaeus,
Archigenes, and Galen.Like these, his predecessors, he recognized an
hepatic dysentery with discharges of bloody serum, which he attributed
with them to atony of the liver, but more boldly than they, and with
characteristic independence, he ventured to treat his patients with
fresh vegetables and fruits, damsons and grapes.Paul of AEgina (660 A.D.)locates the disease in the rectum, and gives
a graphic account of its symptomatology.He made the mistake of many
later practitioners in regarding as a separate disease a symptom,
tenesmus, which he describes as an irresistible desire of evacuation,
"discharging nothing but some bloody humor, which is the cause of the
whole complaint, being an oedematous inflammation of the rectum which
creates the impression of feces lodged in the intestine and a desire of
evacuation.""Dysentery," he continues, "is an ulceration of the
intestines, sometimes arising from the translation of tenesmus, and
sometimes being of itself the primary affection; and is attended with
evacuations at first bilious and of various colors, then accordingly
bloody, and at last ichorous, like that which runs from dead bodies."In curious contrast to these accurate observations is the absurd
suggestion of an obsolete therapy (Galen), that the dried dung of dogs
who had eaten bones, when drank in milk which has been curdled by
having heated pebbles put into it, is of great service; but as an
offset to this freak of fantasy is the renewed advocacy of warm milk,
fallen somewhat into disuse since the days of Hippocrates and Galen:
"And milk itself moderately boiled is an excellent thing"--a
recommendation of the milk diet which now plays such an important role
in the treatment of so many diseases of the alimentary canal.Modern.--From this brief survey it is seen that the writers of
antiquity left nothing in the symptomatology of dysentery for
subsequent authors to describe.All further advance in our knowledge of
this, as of all diseases, was now rendered impossible by the extinction
of the light of science in the long night of the Middle Ages, whose
gloom deepens with succeeding centuries and whose shadows fall close up
to our own times.The modern history of dysentery may be said to begin with Daniel
Sennertus, whose first _Tractatus de Dysenteria_ was published at {781}
Wittenberg in 1626.Sennert gave the deathblow to tenesmus as a
distinct disease, or as even a pathognomonic sign of dysentery, showing
that it is often present in purely local troubles, ulcers, fissures,
hemorrhoids, etc., or is due to disease of other organs--stone in the
bladder, tumors in the womb, etc.He recognized sporadic and epidemic
attacks of the disease, and described under the terms fiens and facta
forms which coarsely correspond to the catarrhal and diphtheritic
varieties of modern pathologists.Improper food, unripe fruits, at
least, cannot be the cause of dysentery, because, he shrewdly observes,
the epidemic of 1624 began in May, before the fruits were ripe, and
ceased in autumn, when they were ripe and in daily use.Moreover,
sucklings at the breast suffered with the disease.Nor could moisture
alone account for the disease, as this epidemic occurred after an
unusually hot and dry spring and early summer.Some other cause must be
invoked, and this other cause is perhaps the occult influence of the
constellations and planets--an explanation which he afterward admits to
be only an asylum of ignorance.In the treatment of the disease the
indication should be to heal the abraded or ulcerated intestine; but
since this cannot be done unless the cause is first removed, "the
abrading, eroding humor should be evacuated and absterged, at the same
time its acrimony mitigated and corrected; then the flux should be
checked by astringents, and the pain, if vehement, lenified and
removed."Purgatives should be repeated until all vicious humors are
discharged.Sydenham  his descriptions of the epidemic which he witnessed in
London in 1669-72 with the artistic touches of the master's hand."The
disease sets in," he says, "with chills and shivers.After these come
the heat of the fever, then gripings of the belly, and lastly stools.Occasionally there is no fever; in which case the gripes lead the way,
and the purging follows soon after.Great torment of the belly and
sinking of the intestines whenever motions are passed are constant; and
these motions are frequent as well as distressing, the bowels coming
down as they take place.They are always more slimy than stercoraceous,
feces being rarely present, and when present causing but little pain.With these slimy motions appear streaks of blood, though not always.Sometimes, indeed, there is no passage of any blood whatever from first
to last.Notwithstanding, provided that the motions be frequent, slimy,
and attended with griping, the disease is a true bloody flux or
dysentery."The efficacy of opium in its treatment causes him to break
out in praises of the great God who has vouchsafed us a remedy of so
much power.But Sydenham was too good a practitioner not to know that
all treatment must be prefaced with laxatives.For "after I had
diligently and maturely weighed in my mind," he says, "the various
symptoms which occur during this disease, I discovered that it was a
fever--a fever, indeed, of a kind of its own--turned inwardly upon the
bowels.By means of this fever the hot and acrid humors contained in
the mass of the blood, and irritating it accordingly, are deposited in
the aforesaid parts through the meseraic arteries."The indications
then were plain--viz."after revulsion by venesection to draw off the
acrid humors by purging."It was the frequent and successful practice
of Sydenham also to drench the patient with liquids, per os et per
rectum--a mode of treatment which both he and the learned Butler, who
accompanied the {782} English ambassador to Morocco, where dysentery
was always epidemic, hit upon, "neither of us borrowing our practice of
the other."Butler declared that the method of deluging the dysentery
by liquids was the best.But many attacks are cured almost on the
expectant plan alone.This was the case with the excellent and learned
Daniel Coxe, Doctor of Physic, in whom "the gripes and bloody motions
ceased after the fourth clyster.He was kept to his bed, limited to
milk diet; and this was all that was necessary in order to restore him
to perfect health."Zimmermann (1767) did not believe that improper food could be a cause
of dysentery, as in the epidemic of 1765 fresh grapes were plentifully
supplied to patients and proved an excellent remedy.He also noticed
the muscular pains (rheumatism) which had been mentioned by Sydenham
before him, and the paralyses first noticed by Fabricius in 1720, as
occurring in the course of, or as sequelae to, the disease.It was only
contagious, he thought, in bad cases, when the stools have a cadaveric
odor.But his main and most useful contributions were in the field of
therapy.He discarded venesection entirely, was among the first to
recognize the value of ipecacuanha, and objected strenuously to opium
until the cause of the evil was expelled.Hence he was vehemently
opposed to all astringents, to the use of which he ascribes the
rheumatisms and dropsies which sometimes occur.Wines and spices were
likewise put under ban; whey he permitted, but not milk, and water
freely, but always warm.Barley-water and cream of tartar were
sufficient food and medicine for ordinary cases, while camphor and
cinchona best sustain the strength in bad cases.Pringle (1772) observed the frequent occurrence of dysentery
coincidently with malarial fever, and was a firm believer in the
contagion of the disease.He claimed that the foul straw upon which the
soldiers slept became infectious, but maintained that the chief source
of infection were the privies "after they had received the dysenteric
excrements of those who first sicken."It is spread in tents and in
hospitals, and may be carried by bedding and clothing, as in the
plague, small-pox, and measles.Neither food nor drink propagates the
disease, he thinks, for, so far as the fruits are concerned, he too had
seen it prevail before the fruits were ripe.The first cause of the
disease is "a stoppage of the pores, checking the perspiration and
turning inward of the humors upon the bowels."Antimony was his
specific in its treatment.He was also fond of Dover's powder in its
relief, and preferred fomentations to opium, which "only palliates and
augments the cause."The best drink for patients with dysentery was
lime-water (one-third) and milk.This period of time is made memorable in the history of dysentery, as
of nearly all internal diseases, by the contributions from direct
observation upon the dead body by the father of pathological anatomy,
John Baptist Morgagni (1779).From the days of Hippocrates down, the
seat of the disease had been, as has been shown, pretty accurately
determined, and the same acumen which enabled the clinicians to
localize the affection had inspired them, as we have seen, to define
and describe its nature.But any descriptions from actual post-mortem
examinations were not put upon record until the beginning of the
sixteenth century, when were published the posthumous contributions of
Benivieni (1506-07).In his description of the lesions of the disease
he says that "the viscera displayed {783} internal erosion from which
sanies was continually discharged."Nearly three centuries elapsed
before Morgagni made his anatomical studies--an interval of time void
of any contributions from pathological anatomy; and so little attention
was paid to this branch of medical science that the descriptions of
Morgagni and of his more immediate successors failed to excite any
general interest or make any permanent impression.Morgagni himself,
while he fully recognized their significance, did not consider the
ulcerations of dysentery as absolutely essential to the disease, as
many cases, even fatal ones, did not exhibit them at all.They were not
liable to be mistaken for the lesions of typhoid fever, the ulceration
of Peyer's glands, because, though they may, they only rarely, coexist
in the same subject.As to the membranous fragments sometimes evacuated
with the discharges of dysentery, Morgagni showed that they are
occasionally true fragments or shreds of the intestinal coats, as has
been maintained by the older writers, Tulpius and Laucisius, but are
far more frequently nothing else than inspissated mucus--conceptions
which subsequent studies with the microscope have fully confirmed.In view of the general disregard of direct observations, it is
therefore not surprising to learn that the nature of the intestinal
lesions gradually fell into oblivion or at least became underrated in
its import.But it is a matter of surprise that Stoll (1780) was able
to declare as the result of autopsies made by himself that, although
the colon is thickened and inflamed, ulcerations in dysenteries are
very rare.This distinguished author did not at all believe in the
contagion of the disease, as he had never seen it attack physicians or
nurses.It developed, he thought with the older writers, as the result
of exposure to cold during a perspiration.He emphatically insisted
upon the frequency of rheumatism as complicating the disease, and
describes in proof a number of cases of painful swollen joints during
and subsequent to the attack.It was his especial merit to have
succeeded in dispensing with the acrid bile as a cause of the disease,
maintaining that hepatic derangements were only accidental
complications, and thus disposed, but only for a time, of bilious
dysentery in so far as it was supposed to depend upon defective or
abnormal action of the liver.But Annesley (1828) soon reinstated the liver in the pathology of
dysentery, with the exhibition of  plates displaying abscess of
the liver in connection with the disease, as well as illustrating the
displacements and constrictions of the colon which sometimes occur in
its course.The fourth decade of our century now brought in the anatomical
contributions of Cruveilhier and Rokitansky, to be followed later by
those of Virchow, upon which the modern morbid anatomy of the disease
is based; while the labors of the Indian physicians and of Copeland,
Parkes, and Vaidy put us in possession of the facts pertaining to its
general pathology.Fayrer has quite recently published the results of
his vast experience with dysentery in India, an important contribution
to the practical study of the disease, and Hirsch has treated
exhaustively of its medical geography.But the merit of publication of
the most complete chapter or work upon dysentery that has ever been
written anywhere belongs to, and is the especial pride of, our own
country.It constitutes the bulk of the second volume of the _Medical
and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion_.It is a veritable
encyclopaedia of knowledge, not {784} only upon the subject of which it
treats, but upon all subjects immediately or even remotely collateral
to it, and is a lasting monument to the labor and the learning of its
author, Joseph J. Woodward, Surgeon of the United States Army.GENERAL REMARKS.--Dysentery may be a primary or a secondary disease.As
a primary disease it occurs in sporadic, endemic (often closely,
sometimes curiously, circumscribed), or epidemic form, and is either
acute or chronic, according to the nature of its symptoms and lesions.The ancient types of sthenic and asthenic or adynamic, typhoid,
bilious, and malarial dysenteries belong rather to history than to
modern medicine.The classification of cases in general use at
present--viz.the catarrhal and croupous or diphtheritic forms--has
reference rather exclusively to the nature of the lesion, and is hence
extremely defective.Nor are the divisions (as in cholera) into
sporadic and epidemic forms much more satisfactory, in that they
indicate simply the range or extent of the disease, and by no means
define a separate array of symptoms or lesions; precisely the same
symptoms or lesions being encountered in individual cases of either
form.None of these divisions clearly indicate differences in etiology,
upon which factor alone can any acceptable division of cases be based.Perhaps less objection may be urged against the assumption of catarrhal
and specific forms, including under the provisional term catarrhal all
the cases which cannot as yet be accounted for by the action of a
special or specific cause.It will become apparent in the study of the etiology of dysentery that
while any of the factors invoked may suffice to produce the catarrhal
(sporadic) form, none will explain the specific (epidemic) form of the
disease; both forms may be alike in their lesion and signs, but they
differ widely in their cause.In other words, dysentery is only a
clinical, and is in no way an etiological, expression of a disease.In
this respect dysentery finds its analogue in a much grosser lesion of
the bowels--namely, occlusion, acute or chronic, which, while it
presents pretty much the same train of symptoms, may depend upon a
great variety of causes, as impaction, strangulation, intussusception,
etc.While any of the causes cited may be sufficient to excite the
catarrhal form of the disease, the same causes may stand to the
specific form only in the relation of predisposing agents.Or, as
Maclean has better put it, "It appears that many of the so-called
causes of dysentery must be regarded more as acute agents of
propagation than of causation."As a secondary disease dysentery occurs in the course of, or as a
sequel to (not infrequently as the terminal affection of), pyaemia and
septicaemia (puerperal fever), typhus and typhoid fevers, pneumonia,
Bright's disease, variola, scarlatina, abscess of the liver (though the
order of sequence is here oftener reversed), scorbutus, marasmus from
any cause, tuberculosis, and cancer.It must not be forgotten, however,
of these latter affections that each produces its own lesions in the
large intestine, which are not to be confounded with those of genuine
dysentery.The view that dysentery shows a periodicity of recurrence at certain
distinct intervals or cycles--three, five, or ten years--is entirely
without foundation in fact; but there is strong ground for believing
that the disease is gradually abating both in frequency and virulence
with improvements in sanitation and hygiene.Thus, Heberden shows that
the {785} number of deaths set down in the seventeenth century under
the titles of bloody flux and gripings of the guts was never less than
1000 annually, and in some years exceeded 4000, whereas during the last
century the number gradually dwindled down to 20 (Watson)--a number
which is certainly a misprint for 200; and Aitken states that as a
cause of death it has been decreasing since 1852.Geissler also
remarks[1] that the variation in epidemics is nowhere so well
illustrated as in the case of dysentery.A noticeable reduction in the
number of cases in England began about 1850, and has continued almost
without interruption to the present time, so that now (1880) six to
eight times less cases occur than in the forties.The same diminution
has been noticed in Bavaria and Sweden.In Sweden the cases treated by
physicians in 1857 numbered no less than 37,000, with over 10,000
deaths; whereas now the number is reduced to 400-500 a year, and the
mortality has experienced a corresponding reduction from 20-30 to 6-8
per cent.[Footnote 1: _Periodische Schwanderungen der wichtigsten Krankheiten_.]At the same time, it is known of dysentery that it sometimes shows an
almost freakish recurrence after long intervals of time, appearing in a
place for many decades free from the disease, to establish itself there
for years as a regular endemic malady, not to disappear again for a
long series of years; in which respect, Hirsch remarks, it much
resembles malaria.Allusion has been already made to the occasional curious
circumscription of the disease in definite localities.In fact,
dysentery, even when late to assume the proportions of a widespread
epidemic, begins, as a rule, and is confined for a time, in individual
enclosed regions--prisons, barracks, hospitals, etc.; and in the
process of dissemination it is rather characteristic of the disease to
leap over or to spare intervening territory and appear in new foci at
some distance from its original seat.A direct irradiation or linear
transmission of the disease is the exception, and not the rule.The
significance of this fact will become evident in the study of the
etiology of the disease.Dysentery is pre-eminently a disease of army life, its victims among
soldiers numbering more than all other diseases together.Sir James
MacGrigor, Medical Superintendent of the British army, called it the
scourge of armies and the most fatal of all their diseases.Aitken says
that "it has followed the tracks of all the great armies which have
traversed Europe during the continental wars of the past two hundred
years."It decimated the French, Prussian, and Austrian armies in 1792.In Cape Colony in 1804 every fourth man among the soldiers was attacked
with the disease, and of those attacked every fifth man died.In
Napoleon's campaign in Egypt dysentery numbered one-half more victims
than the plague; Kinglake says that 5000 men died of dysentery alone in
the war of the Crimea; and in our own country during our Civil War from
1861-65 chronic camp dysentery was the cause of more than one-fourth of
all the diseases reported, the mortality being at the rate of 12.36 per
1000.Woodward relates that the dysenteries, acute and chronic, with
diarrhoeas, made their appearance in the new regiments at the beginning
of the war, and, though mild at first, quickly assumed a formidable
character."Soon no army could move without leaving behind it a host of
the victims.They crowded the ambulance-trains, the railroad-cars, the
{786} steamboats.In the general hospitals they were often more
numerous than the sick from all other diseases, and rivalled the
wounded in multitude.They abounded in the convalescent camps, and
formed a large proportion of those discharged for disability."Most of
the prisoners died of this disease, and great numbers succumbed to it
on retirement to their homes after the cessation of the war.It is the
story of many a campaign, Eichhorst says, that dysentery kills more men
than the enemy's guns.The fact that it sometimes shows itself in periodic form or with
periodic exacerbation, that it is sometimes successfully treated with
quinia, and that, as has been noticed from the days of Hippocrates
down, it prevails in greatest intensity in malarial regions, has given
rise to the view that dysentery is a malarial disease.This view, which
was strongly advocated by many of the older writers, Senac, Fournier,
Annesley, met with renewed support at the hands of many of the surgeons
in our Civil War.But wider observation has shown the fallacy of such a
view; for not only may the diseases prevail entirely independently of
each other in malarial regions, but there are regions where one does
and the other does not exist.Thus Huebner quotes from Rollo concerning
St.Lucie (West Indies), a town situated on a mountain in the midst of
a swampy country in which both dysentery and malaria abound, while the
town itself is almost free from dysentery; and Dutrolan cites Reunion
as a place where marsh fevers do not occur, while dysentery is very
common.Berenger-Feraud[2] scouts the idea of any such connection.Pierre de la Martinique," he says, "where there is
not a piece of marsh as big as a hand, but where dysentery has made
great ravage more than once.We might cite also Mauritius, Gibraltar,
Malta, New Caledonia--places exempt, or almost exempt, from malaria,
but often visited by dysentery."[Footnote 2: _Traite theorique et clinique de la Dysenterie, etc._,
Paris, 1883.]The view that dysentery is a form of typhus or typhoid fever
(Eisenmann) or scurvy needs no refutation in the light of existing
knowledge regarding the pathogenesis and pathology of these affections.These diseases may often complicate, but can never cause, dysentery.Dysentery is a disease which spares no age, sex, or social condition,
the seeming greater suffering of the poorer classes being due to the
filth, food, darkness, dampness--in short, to the bad sanitation--of
poverty.Though the disease is often confined exclusively to soldiers in the
midst of a civil population, examples are not wanting of an exclusive
selection of civilians or of an indiscriminate attack in every
direction.Lastly, dysentery is a disease which may recur repeatedly in
the same individual, one attack rather predisposing to than preventing
another.ETIOLOGY.--Dysentery is an omnipresent disease."Wherever man is,"
Ayres observed of it nearly a quarter of a century ago, "there will
some of its forms appear."But the character of the form, and more
especially the extent and severity of the disease, vary in extreme
degree with the conditions surrounding the abode of man.No one of
these conditions affects the disease so markedly as the climate.It is
the testimony of Hirsch, based upon the study of seven hundred
epidemics of the disease, that no other disease is so dependent upon
the influence of the climate.The home of dysentery is the tropical
zone.It prevails in greatest frequency {787} and virulence in the
tropics, and in those regions of the tropics where the characteristics
of this zone are more pronounced, diminishes in intensity in the
temperate regions, and occurs only in sporadic form farther north.At
40 degrees latitude the line may be pretty sharply drawn; beyond it
dysentery as an epidemic is almost unknown.[3]

[Footnote 3: Shakespeare (_Troilus and Cressida_) cites "griping of the
guts" among the "rotten diseases of the south."]India has been from time immemorial the hotbed of this disease.Henderson says it is perhaps more fatal to natives than all other
diseases put together, and Hutchinson, Hunter, and Tytler observe that
it causes three-fourths of the deaths among the natives of Hindostan.In Egypt the disease is indigenous, and is, according to Frank, post
pestem maxime timendus.Greisinger reports that one-half of all the
autopsies made by him in Egypt showed dysentery as a primary or
secondary affection.It is epidemic here at all times, Roser says, and
all fatal cases of acute or chronic disease finally perish with it.Similar testimony might be adduced from a large part of Africa, much of
Asia, the Indian Archipelago, and the West Indies.It rages
"murderously" in Peru, causing a mortality in some epidemics of 60 to
80 per cent., and occurs in this country not only in the valleys, but
in cities and provinces at the lofty elevation of 8000 to 13,000 feet.Heat, moisture, vegetable decomposition, and sudden atmospheric change
are the distinguishing characteristics of southern climes, and the
study of the etiology of a disease incident or indigenous to these
conditions calls for an investigation of these various factors.It is well established of dysentery that it occurs for the most part in
the hottest season of the year.Of 546 epidemics tabulated by Hirsch,
404 prevailed in summer and fall, 113 in fall and winter, 16 in spring
and summer, and only 13 in winter.Fourteen-fifteenths of the whole
number of epidemics occurred in the months of June to September.And it
is corroborative of these conclusions that of 1500 deaths from
dysentery in the cities of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and
Baltimore from 1816 to 1827, 1100 occurred in the months of July,
August, and September.In fact, the Census Reports (1860-70) of our
country show the maximum mortality in August and September, and the
minimum in January and February.The prevalence of unusual heat may also call out an epidemic in places
where the disease usually shows itself only in endemic or sporadic
form.Thus, the severe epidemic of 1540 in England was preceded by a
heat so intense as to dry up the wells and small streams, in
consequence of which many cattle died of thirst; and the epidemics of
1583 in Germany, of 1758 in France, and of 1847 in our own country,
were characterized in the same way.Interesting in this connection is
the statement of Frick concerning the epidemic in Baltimore in 1849,
who found the cases to increase and decrease almost in proportion to
the elevation and depression of temperature.The epidemic of Weimar in
1868, where 12,000 people fell ill with the disease, illustrated the
rule when it ceased suddenly on the approach of cool weather at the end
of August.But that heat alone is not sufficient to account for the genesis of the
disease is apparent from the occasional occurrence of it in the tropics
in the colder seasons of the year; in the colder climates, Russia,
Sweden, {788} and Canada; and in temperate regions during exceptionally
cool seasons, as in Plymouth in 1769, London in 1808, Massachusetts in
1817.Moreover, the temperate zone is often characterized by seasons of
unusual heat, during the prevalence of which dysentery may be almost
unknown.Thus, during the summer of 1881, in Cincinnati, the
thermometer scarcely fell below 95 degrees F. for weeks at a time, and
was often nearly 100 degrees during the entire night, but the records
at the Health Office show that while cases of heatstroke were
alarmingly frequent, dysentery was unusually rare during the entire
season.That moisture cannot act more, at most, than as an occasional
predisposing cause of dysentery is sufficiently clear from the
statement of Hirsch, that of 119 epidemics, 62 commenced or were
preceded by wet and 57 by dry weather.In truth, dryness long continued
and excessive heat have already been invoked as remote causes of the
disease.But moisture, as contributing to, or being a necessary element
of, vegetable decomposition, the third characteristic of tropical
regions, is entitled to further consideration.Annesley observed that
among troops stationed in the vicinity of rivers, canals, and places
abounding with emanations from the decay of animal and vegetable
matters dysentery became extremely prevalent and assumed a more or less
malignant nature; and Baly, who studied the disease in its famous
outbreak in the Milbank Penitentiary, remarks that "it is greatest at
those seasons and in those states of the atmosphere which most favor
decomposition of organic matter in the soil."In Africa it has been noticed that dysentery appears with the rainy
season, to disappear only at its close; and the same observation has
been made of Bengal, while in Lower Egypt the disease follows the
inundations of the Nile.Burkhardt says of 10,000 cases that one-half
occur in wet hot seasons, two-fifths in dry hot seasons, and but
one-tenth in cold seasons.Moreover, the removal of camping-grounds to
dry localities has often arrested the disease or checked its further
dissemination.Thus, Mursinna states that the removal of the army of
Prince Henry of Hesse from Nimes, where the disease raged fearfully, to
Leitmeritz was attended by its immediate cessation, notwithstanding the
fact that the soldiers ate large quantities of fruit.A statement of
Dillenius, quoted by Heubner, is in this connection exceedingly
instructive: "Dillenius had to march with a dysentery hospital of more
than 500 patients from July 26 to August 3, 1812, and it required four
whole days to accomplish an ordinary nine or ten hours' march.The
patients, extremely exhausted, were finally put into a sheep-shed.Here, in the fresh air and lying on hay, they all improved very
quickly.By advice of the physician they ate for medicine the fresh
whortleberries which they themselves had picked."Werneck attributes
the exemption of the city of Halle since the end of the last century to
the draining and drying of the neighboring marshes.On the other hand, numerous observations go to prove that dysentery is
likewise prevalent in dry sandy soils where the factors so necessary to
the production of malaria are entirely unknown.Thus, Hirsch quotes
from Harthill to the effect that dysentery never occurred among the
English troops in Afghanistan until they entered upon its thoroughly
dry and sandy plains; and from Lidell, who declared that the disease
prevailed most in Panama in March, the dry season at this place.Again,
a striking confirmation of exemption from dysentery in a marshy region
{789} is offered in the Antilles at Grande-Terre, "a wet, marshy plain
severely visited by malaria, but used by patients attacked with chronic
dysentery at Basse-Terre as the safest place of refuge and recovery."The role of moisture and vegetable decomposition may be, then, summed
up in the words of Annesley, that "all situations which furnish
exhalations from the decay of animal or vegetable productions under the
operation of a moist and hot state of the atmosphere will always
occasion dysentery in the predisposed subject--_circumstances which,
with other causes_ [italics ours], combine to generate the disease."Atmospheric vicissitudes, checking of perspiration, catching cold, are
synonyms in the present popular as in the ancient professional
conception of the genesis of dysentery."Of the remote causes of
dysentery," Johnson says, "I need say little; they are the same in all
parts of the world--atmospheric vicissitudes."And in making this
statement the author expresses the almost universal testimony of the
Indian physicians."Sudden change of temperature," observes
Kaputschinsky of the Trans-Caucasus, where dysentery is rife, "is in
this region no rarity.The sultry heat of noon often alternates with a
cutting cold wind, and vice versa.In the same place is now a warm, now
a cold, now a glowing hot breeze, and such changes most predispose to
dysentery."And McMullin says of the Barbadoes that "it is a curious
fact that this disease is most prevalent where from the immediate
contiguity of mountains sudden vicissitudes of temperature are
experienced."Didelot says also of South France, "It is not the fruits,
as people still believe to-day, which act as causes of dysentery, but
the sudden variations of the air."Ruthay remarks of the dysentery of
China that the most common cause is a chill caught by sleeping in a
draught uncovered or in the open air.Metzler attributes the exemption
of Stuttgart (since 1811) from any great epidemic to the fact that the
city lies in a valley open only to the east, which permits no contrast
of hot days and cold nights; and Seeger, in speaking of the epidemic
which occurred in Ludwigsberg in 1872 (a city of twelve thousand
population, where no epidemic of any kind had appeared since 1834, and
where 870 were suddenly attacked with dysentery) that it first broke
out in Kaffeeburg in two streets exposed to the wind, and thence spread
to different parts of the city.Exposure of the body, especially the
abdomen, during sleep or when perspiring, the sudden laying aside of
flannel body-clothes, are proceedings, Fayrer says, pregnant with
danger in dysenteric regions.A lamentable dysentery appeared,
according to Trotter, on board H.M.S.Berwick Oct., 1780, "in
consequence of the hurricane on the fifth of the month, by which the
clothes and bedding of the seamen, and indeed all parts of the ship,
were soaked in water, and many of the men slept for nights together on
the wet decks overcome with fatigue and debilitated from want of food."Fayrer also quotes from Moseley the observation that "it often happens
that hundreds of men in a camp have been seized with the dysentery
almost at the same time after one shower of rain or from lying one
night in the wet and cold."As illustrating the conjoined operation of all these various causes,
together with filth and foul effluvia, more especially exposure to
cold, the story of dysentery was never better told than by Sir James
MacGrigor, who, in speaking of the Peninsular campaign, remarks that
"the army during June as well as July was traversing Castile, where it
was {790} exposed to the direct influence of a burning sun darting its
rays through a sky without a single cloud, the troops marching and
fighting during the day, and bivouacking during the night on arid,
unsheltered plains.They felt at times every vicissitude of heat and
cold.In the rapid advance they could not be regularly supplied with
food or had not time to cook it, and not unfrequently indulged in bad
wine and unripe fruit."... The thousands of sick (chiefly from
diarrhoea, dysentery, and remittent fever) were hurried off to Ciudad
Rodrigo, the nearest hospital-station to the frontier of Portugal, a
town "composed chiefly of ruins with very narrow streets,"... and from
having been "so much the object of contest, and alternately the site of
the hospitals of all the contending armies, nearly twenty thousand
bodies were calculated to have been put into the earth either in the
town or under its walls in the course of a few months."... "It may
easily be conceived," the author adds, "in what state cases of
dysentery must have arrived after having sustained a journey in extent
from four to twenty days, conveyed chiefly in bullock-carts or on the
backs of mules, sometimes under incessant rain for several days
together."It is really quite superfluous to cite further opinions or examples in
illustration of a fact which is so universally conceded as to be
exaggerated in its general significance.Taking cold is the common idea
of the cause of dysentery, and is always a satisfactory explanation in
a case of obscure origin in this or any disease, even though the
patient may be able to recall no possible exposure.The physician
himself contents himself only too easily with resort to this refuge,
and with further appeal to the locus minoris resistentiae, as the
explanation of the seat of the disease, which he hopes to cure with the
aid of the vis medicatrix naturae.But taking cold is only a popular
paraphrase for contracting a disease, and will bear no scientific
analysis of its meaning.Mere reduction of temperature will certainly
not produce a disease whose habitat is the hottest zone, nor will a
sudden chill of the surface be accepted as a sufficient cause so long
as men daily remain exempt after a sudden plunge into cold water.Some
other factor must be invoked to account for the outbreak of specific
(epidemic) dysentery.The influence of the nervous system, the mechanical and chemical or
specific action of the ingesta and dejecta, remain to be especially
considered in the etiology of the disease.The influence of the nervous system is more directly seen in the
production of diarrhoeas than dysenteries, but that sustained
disturbances of the emotions play an important part in the production
of dysentery is shown by the greater frequency of the disease among
prisoners of war.In the Franco-Prussian war the French prisoners
suffered more than the Germans, and the records of prison-life in our
own war, at Andersonville, Libby, and Salisbury, furnish ghastly
chapters in the history of this disease.Many other factors contribute
to the development of the disease under such circumstances--in fact,
all the cruelties of man's inhumanity to man--but the influence of the
nervous system is too plain to be mistaken.The communication between
the cervical ganglia and the sympathetic nerve-fibres which preside
over the cerebral circulation and regulate intestinal peristalsis has
been invoked (Glax) in explanation of the direct action of the brain
upon the intestinal canal.Curious in this {791} connection is the
claim of Savignac, who considered dysentery a disease of the nervous
system because in two cases he found spots of softening in the spinal
cord.The noxious action of irritating articles of diet has been recognized
in the production of dysentery from the earliest times.Aretaeus
mentions acrid foods, and Aetius crudities, as directly causing the
disease; and unripe fruits have been especially stigmatized from the
days of Galen down.Decomposing, fermenting food and drink cause
diarrhoea much more frequently than dysentery, but if the irritation be
severe or prolonged, or be superimposed upon a catarrhal state, a
diarrhoea, it is claimed, may pass over into dysentery.Impurities in
drinking-water were charged with causing dysentery by Hippocrates
himself, with whom Avicenna fully coincided; and the view that
epidemics of the disease are caused in this way has been abundantly
advocated ever since.So far as running water is concerned, the
researches of Pettenkofer have shown that all impurities are speedily
destroyed, for even at the distance of a few rods from the reception of
sewage the water is perfectly safe.Nor does standing water lack the
means of purification, provided it be sufficiently exposed to the air.The observations of Roth and Lex have shown that the water of the wells
of fifteen churchyards in Berlin contained nitrates in less quantity
than the average wells in the city; and Fleck made a similar statement
with regard to the wells of Dresden.But no one in our day would rely
upon a mere chemical analysis in the detection of the organic poisons
or particles of disease.It is the physiological test which remains the
most conclusive, and the evidence in favor of the production of
dysentery by the ingestion of drinking-water poisoned by the reception
of excrementitious matter, especially the dejecta of disease, is as
positive as in the case of typhoid fever.Thus, De Renzy found that the
number of cases of dysentery "immediately decreased at Sibsagor (India)
so soon as better drinking-water was obtained from wells deeply sunk
and lined with earthenware glazed pipes;" and Payne found that the
cases of dysentery (as well as diarrhoea and lumbrici) almost
disappeared from the asylum at Calcutta as soon as the habit of
drinking water from the latrines was stopped.In face of such facts,
which might be infinitely multiplied, one would hesitate to subscribe
to the statement of Fergusson that "true dysentery is the offspring of
heat and moisture, of moist cold in any shape after excessive heat; but
nothing that a man could put into him would ever give him a true
dysentery."The relation of the action of the dejecta must be studied from the
double standpoint of the development and the dissemination of the
disease, as originating the catarrhal form by mechanical or chemical
irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and as spreading the specific form
by direct or indirect infection.By the time the contents of the alimentary canal have reached the colon
they have become, through absorption of their fluids, more or less
inspissated, and hence as hard, globular masses fill the sacculi of the
large intestine.Mechanical irritations by crude, indigestible residue
of any kind of food, more especially of vegetable food, or chemical
irritations, as by fermenting food, accumulate in this region, fret the
mucous membrane into a state of inflammation, even ulceration, and
produce the anatomical picture and the clinical signs of dysentery.If
there be a superadded or {792} pre-existent catarrhal condition of the
mucosa or a defective peristalsis of the muscular coat, which is
sluggish enough at best, the development of a pathological state is
much facilitated.And there is no doubt that the dysentery of the
tropics is increased by the bulky, indigestible, feces-producing
character of the food.The anatomical construction of the colon may also favor these processes
by its mere abnormal length or size or by duplicatures in its course.The protracted constipation of the insane, in whom the transverse colon
is often found elongated or displaced--to assume the well-known M-form,
for instance--may partially account for the frequency of dysentery in
these cases (Virchow), though the neglect which comes of preoccupation
of the mind, with the general inhibition of peristalsis, is a more
frequent cause of the constipation.Wernich (1879) sums up the action of the feces, independently of a
specific cause, in attributing the dysentery of the tropics, aside from
the great changes of temperature, to (1) bad aborts, the dejecta being
deposited in all parts of the towns or into an opening made in the
floor of the hut, with which is associated total lack of personal
cleanliness; (2) to the diet, which causes a large amount of feces; and
(3) to the relaxation of the intestine in general, permitting
accumulations of infecting matter.Upon the question of the propagation of the disease by the dejecta rest
in great measure the all-important problems of a specific virus and of
the contagiousness of the disease.It is the almost universal opinion of those who have had the
opportunity of widest observation that epidemic dysentery arises from,
or is due to, a specific cause, a miasm, a malaria (in its wide
etymologic sense, bad air), which emanates from the soil.The
simultaneous sudden attack of great numbers under the most diverse
surroundings admits of explanation in no other way.But the precise
nature of the morbific agent is still unknown.The similarity of
epidemic dysentery to malaria would indicate the existence of a low
form of vegetable life, a schizomycete, as the direct cause of the
disease.But the proof of the presence of a specific parasite or germ
is still lacking, and though its speedy disclosure by means of the
solid-culture soils may be confidently predicted, it cannot, in the
light of existing knowledge, be declared as yet.Especial difficulty is encountered in the study of micro-organisms in
diseases of the alimentary canal because of the myriad variety in
enormous numbers found in healthy stools.Decomposition and
fermentation both begin in the large intestine, so that the feces swarm
with the bacteria and torulae productive of these processes.Woodward
declares that his own observations have satisfied him that "a large
part of the substance of the normal human feces is made up of these low
forms in numbers which must be estimated by hundreds of millions in the
feces of each day," bacteria, micrococci, and torulae being found
"floating in countless multitudes along with fragments of
partly-digested muscular fibres and other debris from the food;" but
while the torulae are increased, the other micro-organisms, bacteria,
etc., do not appear to be more numerous in the stools of dysentery than
in healthy feces.The doctrine that dysentery depends upon parasites is very old in
medicine, and included animal as well as vegetable growths.Langius
(1659) declared that swarms of worms could be found in dysenteric
stools, and {793} Nyander (1760) went so far as to call dysentery a
scabies intestinorum interna; which extravagant conception would have
speedily met with merited oblivion had not his preceptor, the great
Linnaeus, incorporated the Acarus dysenteriae into his _Systema
Naturae_.Sydenham about this time (1670) expressed a much clearer
conviction of the cause of the disease when he spoke of "particles
mixed with the atmosphere which war against health and which determine
epidemic constitutions."Baly (1849) first proclaimed the idea of a vegetable fungus, similar to
that described by Brittan and Swayne in cholera, as the parasite of the
disease; and Salisbury (1865) described algoid cells and species of
confervae as occurring abundantly in all well-marked cases.Klebs
(1867) found spore-heaps and rod-like bacteria in the stools of
dysentery as in cholera, but maintained that those of dysentery were
larger and thinner than those of cholera.Hallier (1869) maintained
that although there was no morphological difference in the
micro-organisms of the stools of dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera,
he was able by culture-experiments to develop the micrococcus of
dysentery into a special fungus, which he called Leiosporium
dysentericum.Busch (1868) demonstrated nests and colonies of
micrococci, as well as mycelium, in the villi and among the glands of
the mucous and submucous tissues in the cases of dysentery from Mexico
which he examined, but Heubner (1870) was able to disclose them in
equal numbers in preserved preparations or fresh contents of healthy
intestines.Dyer[4] (1870) believes that the parasites constituting the
mildew or sweat which forms a viscous pellicle upon fruit is the agent
which directly produces and propagates the disease.Mere immaturity of
fruit gives rise only to diarrhoea.This parasite occurs in some years
more than others, which accounts for the irregularity of occurrence of
the disease.He avers that it is only necessary to clean fruit, more
especially plums, to prevent the disease.This suggestion merits place
only as a curiosity in the history of the mycology of dysentery.[Footnote 4: _Journal f. Kinderkrankheiten_, No.More important are the results of the experiments of Rajewski (1875),
who found the lymph-spaces filled with bacteria, and who was able to
produce a diphtheritic exudation upon the surface and in the substance
of the mucous membrane of the colon by the injection of fluids
impregnated with bacteria into the bowels or blood of rabbits; but this
result was only obtained when the mucous membrane had been previously
irritated or brought into a catarrhal state by the introduction of
dilute solutions of ammonia.It remains for subsequent investigation to
confirm these highly significant conclusions, which, when properly
interpreted, may explain the action of the predisposing and exciting
causes of the disease.Rajewski's bacteria, it is needless to state,
were simply the bacteria of common putrefaction.Lastly, Prior (1883)
describes a micrococcus as the special micro-organism of dysentery, and
Koch (1883), in prosecuting his studies of cholera in Egypt, remarks
incidentally upon a special bacillus which he encountered in the
intestinal canal in dysentery, though he is as yet by no means prepared
to ascribe to it pathogenetic properties.The question of contagion hinges upon the specificness of the disease,
and cannot be definitely determined until this problem is finally
solved.The old writers believed in the contagion of dysentery.Helidaeus {794} declared that he "had often seen it communicated by the
use of clyster-pipes previously used in the treatment of those
suffering with the disease, and not properly cleaned;" and Horstius and
Hildanus speak of the communicability of the disease from the latrines
contaminated by dysenteric excreta.Van Swieten maintained that
washerwomen contract it, and that physicians and nurses might be
affected.Degner saw the disease spread from street to street in
Nimeguen, while every one who came in contact with the disease became
affected.Pringle observed it spread from tent to tent in the same way;
and Tissot went so far as to declare, "Sil ya une maladie veritablement
contagieuse c'est celle ci."Ziemssen believed that the disease is only
contagious when the element of crowd-poisoning is superadded; and
Heubner states that trustworthy army surgeons in the Franco-Prussian
War frequently saw infection occur when many severe cases were heaped
together in a small space.Under these circumstances thorough
disinfection of the privies checked the spread of the disease.But it
was the universal testimony of these surgeons, as also of our own
surgeons of the Civil War, that the disease was never transported to
the civil population by any of the tens of thousands of cases on their
return to their homes.By most modern writers dysentery is given a place, in respect to
contagion, between the exanthematous maladies, typhus and scarlatina,
which are without doubt contagious, and the purely miasmatic diseases,
malarial and yellow fevers, which are without doubt not contagious.Dysentery is ranked with typhoid fever, which is contagious, not by
contact with the body, but with the discharges.It is not a question in
dysentery of epithelial drift or pulmonary exhalations, but of
ingestion or reception of the dejecta of the disease.By this
observation it is intended to convey the impression that dysentery,
like typhoid fever, is mostly spread in this way, but the reverse may
be true; it may be spread, like yellow fever and malaria, by poisons in
the air.But dysentery, as has been repeatedly remarked, is only a
clinical expression of a disease which may be caused in many ways; and
among these causes, least potent perhaps, but present nevertheless, is
contagion.For, not to mention the epidemics which were undoubtedly
spread in this way, as among the Allies at Valmy in 1792, among the
French in Poland in 1807, and in the hospital at Metz in 1870,
dysentery has been directly communicated by the use of clysters,
bed-pans, and privies in a most unmistakable way.According to Eichhorst, the poison of dysentery is endowed with
extraordinary persistence of duration or tenacity of life in the
stools; for "observations are recorded where dysenteric stools have
been emptied into privies, and individuals employed to clean them out
after the lapse of ten years have been infected with the disease.These
observations go to prove, of this as of other similar affections
(typhoid fever), that the virus or microbe of the disease finds its
most favorable nidus in vaults, cesspools, sewers, etc.When the poison
is exposed to the air it is much more speedily destroyed, but is in the
mean time of course a possible conveyer of the disease."Fayrer quotes
from an anonymous writer, "whose views are as remarkable for their
force as for their originality," the rather extravagant assertion that
"if human excrement be not exposed to the air there can be no
dysentery."{795} Knoewenagel has recently[5] opened up a new series of reflections
in his suggestion of a possible direct infection of the large intestine
per rectum, where the disease usually begins and is mostly best
expressed.He calls attention to the fact that people who suffer with
constipation indulge in longer sessions at stools and induce in
straining efforts a degree of relaxation of the rectal mucosa.The
mucous membrane at its orifice may become at the same time abraded by
hardened fecal masses, to leave open surfaces or crevices upon which
germs may lodge.Moreover, aspiration follows the efforts at expulsion,
and the air with its particles is drawn directly into the rectum, thus
affording all the conditions for immediate or direct infection.[Footnote 5: _Schmidt's Jahrbucher_, Sept.At any rate, it must be admitted that the evidence in favor of
contagion is in some cases too strong to be ignored.A single instance
may suffice for illustration: Flugel reports that the towns of
Nordhaben and Reichenbach, containing together twenty-two hundred
inhabitants, were visited by dysentery in 1873, when nearly four
hundred people were attacked.The visit of a relative carried the
disease from Reichenbach to the daughter of an innkeeper at Tauchnitz,
and from this house the disease spread over the whole place, so that in
a short time more than one hundred people fell ill.Four to six,
sometimes as many as eleven, members of one family were successively or
simultaneously affected.The use of the same bed was the surest means
of contagion.The duration of the poison was proven in an exquisite case, which is,
however, not entirely free from objection: Two children of an officer
were severely affected in September and October, 1872.In January,
1873, the house was vacated and occupied by a successor in office,
whereupon in April, six months after dysentery had disappeared from the
place, the wife and child of the second officer were affected with the
disease.To sum up the etiology of dysentery in a few words, it may be said that
few chapters in medicine are so thoroughly unsatisfactory, as the
prospect of reconciling the accumulated discordant facts is very
discouraging.Because of the singular uniformity in the symptoms and
lesions the temptation is strong to look for a common cause, and to
ascribe all cases to this cause, explaining differences by degree
rather than by kind.Such a view would find solid support in the
assumption of a specific germ, and would ally dysentery with typhoid
fever, a disease which has likewise, in all cases, uniform symptoms and
lesions, and which prevails in both sporadic and epidemic form.The
advocates of this view would fix the poison of the disease in the air
and alimentary canal (but not in the blood), and explain the existence
of individual cases, as well as the prevalence of epidemics, by
meteorological conditions as affecting the growth or dissemination of
specific germs.Nor would the adoption of this view exclude the
possibility of producing the catarrhal (sporadic) cases by many kinds
of noxious germs, including those of common putrefaction.Hot air and
wet air are notorious bearers and breeders of germs, and the law of
gravity keeps them near the surface of the earth--conditions which
coincide with the prevalence of the disease in the tropics and among
individuals (soldiers) who sleep upon the ground.If the contagion of
the disease be admitted, the existence of a {796} contagium animatum is
implied at once, for no chemical poison has the power of propagation.But the germ of dysentery has not been found as yet, and until it has
been found, cultivated in suitable soil, and inoculated to produce the
disease, the evidence of its existence remains merely presumptive.So that at the present time dysentery must be regarded as a malady
which stands in closer relation to, or finds a better analogue in,
cholera than typhoid fever; for cholera is a disease which has the same
geography, has likewise nearly uniform symptoms and lesions, so far as
it leaves any, and certainly has two distinct forms of origin--one
clearly specific, cholera Asiatica, and the other catarrhal, cholera
morbus.PATHOLOGY.--Dysentery is a local malady, but, like every local malady
if sufficiently severe, it may show constitutional effects.It is
usually gradually ushered in from a lighter form of gastro-intestinal
catarrh.After a stage of incubation which lasts from a few hours to a
few days symptoms of dyspepsia and diarrhoea set in or increase,
attended with anorexia, heartburn, nausea, eructation or borborygmi,
pain in the abdomen, and copious fluid discharges.Hereupon ensue the
pains and the discharges characteristic of the disease.Violent griping
and colicky pains (tormina) traverse the abdomen, with sickening
sensations of depression.The desire of evacuation of the bowels
(tenesmus) becomes intense and more or less constant, and the discharge
itself is attended with little or no relief.At the same time the
region of the rectum, intensely inflamed, is the seat of intolerable
burning pain, which becomes excruciating with the introduction of a
speculum or the finger.The discharges may be copious, dark-brown, thin, and highly offensive
(bilious dysentery), may contain occasional hard round fecal casts of
intestinal sacculi (scybalae), or may become more and more scant, until
with the most violent efforts only the minutest quantity is extruded of
mucus, generally streaked or tinged with blood (rose mucus) like the
rusty sputum of pneumonia.Later, all effort at emptying the alimentary
canal may be futile (dysenteria sicca), or the mucus may be pure or
commingled with pus to remain perfectly colorless (dysenteria alba), or
with blood in larger quantity (dysenteria rubra).In other cases, or at
other periods in the same case, the discharges consist of fleshy masses
composed of inspissated mucus or pus, blood, and tissue-debris (lotura
carnea).Sometimes, though rarely, the discharges consist of pure
blood, but oftener of a copious turbid fluid, which on standing
separates into a clear upper layer of serum and a sediment of
disintegrated lotura carnea.Or, lastly, the sediment is composed of
small round vitreous masses, evidently swollen by maceration to look
like sago-grains, which have been erroneously supposed to represent the
liberated contents of the intestinal follicles.The general condition of the patient suffers correspondingly.There may
be fever or there may be none throughout the whole course of the
disease, but the pain and discharges quickly exhaust the strength of
the patient, and in severe or long-continued cases lead to emaciation
and profound prostration.The skin is hot and dry; the tongue is heavily coated; the face wears
an anxious expression.The abdomen is tumid with gases, or in more
advanced cases sunken, discolored, and tender, especially in the course
{797} of the colon, whose thickened walls may often be felt beneath the
emaciated surface.The anus is spasmodically constricted, or in the
worst cases paralyzed, patulous, and livid or blue.Prolapse of the
rectum is common in children, and excoriation of the perineum by the
acrid discharges is not infrequent.Finally, a typhoid state may set in or a pyaemia occur, when the
discharges may become involuntary or unconscious, and brain
symptoms--insomnia, stupor, delirium, and coma--supervene; or the
patient may linger long enough to perish by simple exhaustion or
marasmus.Under favorable hygiene the great majority of cases of catarrhal
dysentery recover without special treatment in the course of from three
to ten days, but specific dysentery has no definite duration and but
little tendency to spontaneous cure.The worst cases are often quickly
controlled by appropriate interference, and the most surprising results
may be sometimes obtained in cases of even years' duration.On the
other hand, a certain percentage of cases is characterized by a
defiance to every kind of treatment, including the last resort, a
change of climate.An acute case of catarrhal dysentery generally subsides without
lesions, and the natural duration of the attack may be much abbreviated
by proper treatment.Specific or epidemic dysentery lasts from two to
four weeks, or, becoming chronic, continues for years or for life, with
exacerbations and remissions.Various complications are liable to occur in the course of the disease.Three deserve especial mention--viz.affection of the joints
(rheumatism), paralysis, and abscess of the liver.Perforation and
peritonitis, always possibilities, and deformities of the colon,
thickenings, and constrictions, are not infrequently left.MORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions of dysentery are the ordinary signs of
inflammation of a mucous membrane and its subjacent structures.They do
not differ in any essential way from those of any mucous surface in a
state of inflammation, the minor variations being due to differences in
the anatomy and physiology of the part affected.Thus, a description of
the pathological process in inflammation of the pharynx, bronchi, or
uterus would answer upon the post-mortem table for the same process in
the large intestine, and the finer microscopic lesions could be
differentiated in any case only by the histology of the part affected.A slight lesion of any mucous membrane constitutes what is known as a
catarrhal process; a more grave affection, a diphtheritic process; a
more chronic inflammation, a hypertrophic or hyperplastic process.Hence an easy distinction between sporadic and epidemic cases might be
based upon the character of the lesion found.But, as has been stated
already, it is impossible to draw a line between catarrhal and specific
cases, the same lesions being found in either form.The difference, so
far as the morbid anatomy is concerned, is wholly in degree or stage,
and not at all in kind, the specific (epidemic) form presenting the
graver lesion as a rule.So most cases of sporadic dysentery show only
catarrhal lesions, while most cases of epidemic dysentery show
diphtheritic lesions.Catarrhal dysentery shows as its first obvious alteration a hyperaemia
of the mucous surface.It is limited exclusively to the large intestine
in the vast majority of cases, and only in rare exceptions affects the
small intestine, though cases have been mentioned as curiosities in
which the {798} process has reached the stomach in its upmost
prolongation.The hyperaemia is most marked, as a rule, in the lowest
parts of the large intestine, the rectum and descending colon, but
there is, as Virchow has pointed out, a peculiar predisposition to
affection at the seat of all the flexures, the iliac, hepatic, splenic,
sigmoid, where the additional element of fecal arrest or impaction is
superadded to the cause of the disease.The catarrhal process occurs first in detached spots or streaks upon
the projecting folds or duplicatures of the mucous membrane; which
spots coalesce to form extensive surfaces.Examined by transmitted
light, these surfaces show a distinct arborescence of the vessels.Or
the disease may commence in the follicles in distinct areas of the
large intestine, and may remain confined to these structures to
constitute the variety known as follicular dysentery.The hyperaemia of inflammation is attended with dilatation and paresis
of the vessel-walls and retardation of the circulation.The whole
process may be arrested at this stage, so that there escapes from the
vessels, at most, only serum to develop the oedema which, with the
defective nutrition from arrest of the circulation, gives rise to the
softening of the epithelial cells.These cells may be thus lifted from
their bed to constitute the process of desquamation, the fundamental
anatomical characteristic of acute dysentery, by which process the
submucous connective tissue is laid bare and the so-called catarrhal
ulcer results.Or the epithelium, but partially detached, may remain
upon the surface, "either raised in the shape of small vesicles which
contain clear serum, or it forms a grayish-white layer resembling the
mealy scurf of the epidermis--an appearance which probably induced
Linnaeus to term dysentery scabies intestinorum interna" (Rokitansky).Kelsch maintains that the inflammatory process in dysentery commences
in the delicate connective tissue between the follicles, the network of
small spindle-shaped cells with multiple nuclei becoming speedily
penetrated by a number of very small, newly-formed vessels.Where the
epithelium is desquamated the surface is covered with granulations as
after a wound.The disposition of the follicles is soon deranged, for,
instead of standing in rows like gun-barrels, they are pushed asunder
and uplifted, so as to remain at different heights.Their interior
becomes blocked with mucus or their orifices occluded, so that
retention-cysts are formed to give rise to the appearance of the bead
necklace.Soon the walls of neighboring follicles coalesce, dissolve
away, and communication is established between them.The interior of
these communicating tubes or canals is filled with vitreous mucus; the
walls are stripped of their lining cells, but their "blind extremities
contain still adherent colossal epithelial cells."Moreover, the
follicles break into each other under the proliferative budding
process, so that the end of a distorted tube may be found in the
interior of another.Where follicles are destroyed the mucous membrane
above them or in their vicinity collapses--a condition observed and
described by Colin as effrondement.The mucosa in these regions may
appear perfectly uninjured, but by "blowing upon it with a tube it is
lifted up like an ampulla to show an opening in its centre," though
more frequently the mucous membrane collapses or sinks in at the region
of destruction.The inner surface of the mucosa is rendered
additionally uneven by the elevations or protuberances caused by the
{799} proliferations in the submucous connective tissue.The older
writers (Pringle, Hewson) regarded these projections as tumors of the
mucosa, and Rokitansky, who describes their true nature, speaks of them
as warty, tubercular (nodular) swellings or fungoid
excrescences--constituting a condition, he says, which Gely has termed
hypertrophie mamelonne.The alternate elevations and depressions thus
produced have been likened to the representations of bird's-eye views
of mountain-chains.As a rule, occasional red blood-corpuscles are also permitted to escape
through the vessel walls in the process of diapedesis to give to the
surface mucus its characteristic tinge, and punctate submucous
hemorrhage is very frequently seen.The pressure of the swollen, softened mucosa upon the sensitive nerves,
and the irritation of the acrid intestinal contents, are often invoked
to account for the constant desire of defecation (tenesmus) which
constitutes such an essential symptom of the disease; but both the
tenesmus and the colicky pains (tormina) precede the anatomical
changes, and are much more rationally explained by the direct action
upon the nerves of the cause of the disease, or by the derangement of
innervation effected through changes in the circulation.An acute case of catarrhal dysentery may exhibit no further lesions,
and in the lightest cases even these may have entirely disappeared
post-mortem, so that no change at all may be observed at the autopsy.In a more severe or protracted case the other alterations which
constitute the more complete cycle of the inflammatory process follow
the stage of hyperaemia.The arrest of circulation becomes more or less
complete, and the white corpuscles emigrate from the vessels to form
the pus-cells.Fibrin, or the elements which compose it, also escapes
to infiltrate the mucous membrane and remain upon its surface.The
pseudo-membranous or diphtheritic process is now developed, and may
vary in intensity from a mere frosting of the surface to dense
infiltration of the entire thickness.The false membrane, as well as
the mucous membrane, next suffers necrosis to form more or less
extensive sloughs.These sloughs are grayish-white when fresh,
dark-brown when stained by the intestinal contents, or greenish or
black when undergoing gangrene.They may cover patches of the mucosa or
the whole mucosa from the ileo-caecal valve to the rectum.They soon
become soft and pultaceous, hang in flaps or festoons in the interior
of the intestinal tube, or, detached, are voided in fragments or
shreds.One such fragment nine inches long is recorded in Woodward's
exhaustive description of the pathology of this disease.Examined under
the microscope, they are seen to consist of coagulated fibrin, red and
white blood-corpuscles, epithelial cells and debris, necrotic pieces of
mucosa, and myriads of micrococci and other micro-organisms.The fall of the sloughs leaves the dysenteric ulcer.Its edges are
irregular and ragged, its base uneven like a crater, and its surface is
more or less covered with pultaceous debris.The submucous connective
tissue may form its base, or, this structure having been also
destroyed, the muscularis may be exposed, or in more extensive
necrobiosis the peritoneum itself may be laid bare.Occasionally this
last barrier is broken down, and perforation occurs.Or an acute
peritonitis may be developed, in dysentery as in typhoid fever, by
simple extension of the inflammatory {800} process without perforation.Perforation is very rare in cases of follicular ulceration, and is by
no means frequent in the diphtheritic process, but it is the most
frequent cause of peritonitis in chronic dysentery.It may occur in any
part of the colon, but does occur most frequently in the caecum.The
resulting peritonitis is fatal as a rule, but the danger is obviated
sometimes, as in typhoid fever, by agglutination of the gut to a
contiguous structure or viscus.Perforation usually occurs late in the
disease, but it may occur very early.Thus Nagele reports from the
Franco-Prussian War a case in which perforation took place on the
fourth day, the diagnosis having been confirmed by an autopsy.In rare
cases a perityphlitis may ensue, with its natural consequences, or
periproctitis may be developed with perineal abscess, or, finally,
fistulae may form to burrow about and discharge themselves anywhere in
or upon the surface of the abdomen, the lumbar region, or the thigh.Bamberger describes cases of perityphlitis attending dysentery, in some
of which resorption occurred, while in others pus was discharged upon
the surface of the abdomen; and the writer of this article once saw, in
consultation with T. A. Reamy, a case of fistula which extended from
the descending colon to the vagina.Through the opening made to
discharge the pus from a fluctuating abscess pointing in the vaginal
vault an india-rubber tube could be passed for six to eight inches.The
patient finally died from marasmus.Chronic dysentery is distinguished by the alterations which occur in
inflammation developing more gradually and extending over a longer
period of time.Under the irritative changes resulting from an altered
circulation the connective tissue undergoes marked hyperplasia, so that
the wall of the intestine becomes at times enormously thickened, and
its calibre is often correspondingly diminished.Cornil observes that
acute or subacute dysentery is characterized by infiltration of the
submucous connective tissue, followed by destruction, while in chronic
dysentery the predominant lesion is essentially a proliferation and
thickening of the connective tissue of the large intestine.The
muscular tissue also undergoes hypertrophy, and the peritoneum becomes
thickened and opaque.Sometimes the peritoneum is covered with patches
of false membrane, or agglutination occurs with other portions of the
intestine to give rise to contortions or occlusions.Ulceration shows itself in chronic dysentery in every grade and stage
of the process, from the first denudations to old cicatrizations.In
bad cases the whole course of the colon from the ileo-caecal valve to
the rectum may constitute one vast tract of suppuration.Blood-vessels
may be opened by the necrotic process, and copious, even fatal,
hemorrhage may ensue.When pure blood is discharged, the hemorrhage
usually occurs in this way per rhexem, but the quantities of blood
evacuated with other elements usually escape per diapedesem.The cicatrization which results puckers the edges of the ulcers, and
may in cases of extensive or circular ulceration lead to more or less
stenosis of the intestinal tube.According to Rindfleisch, the scars of
dysenteric ulcers are very prone to contract, so that "the liability of
a subsequent stricture is directly proportionate to the extent of the
previous ulceration."The danger in these cases may be immediate from
entire, or more remote from partial, occlusion.Thus, Bamberger records
a case of {801} typhlitis due to impaction of feces above a stenosis
gradually developed from a dysenteric ulcer.Although dysentery is a disease of the large intestine, its lesions are
not exclusively limited to this structure.It is always a purely local
disease at first, and, strictly speaking, continues so throughout its
course, yet it produces in severe or chronic cases widespread and
general effects.Rapid emaciation sets in, and anaemia is soon
pronounced in all the internal organs.The mesenteric glands show signs
of irritation or of absorption of specific products in hyperaemic
pigmentation and hyperplasia.The kidneys in acute cases exhibit venous
stasis, and in chronic cases may undergo parenchymatous change.The
joints are peculiarly liable to suffer in certain cases, and the
nervous system may exhibit lesions--points to be described in the
symptomatology of the disease.Should pyaemia occur, it superimposes
its own particular lesions in the serous membranes and internal organs.All of these affections are to be regarded, however, rather as
complications than essential effects.But the liver is found affected so frequently in dysentery as to
constitute more than a mere coincidence.Schneider has recently (1873)
reported of the results of his observations on 1400 cases of tropical
dysentery that in the 395 post-mortem examinations the liver was found
normal in but 10 cases.The abnormalities were as follows: hyperaemia
of various grades, 160; fatty degeneration, 62; abscess, 57; nutmeg
liver, 47; perihepatitis, 25; granular atrophy, 19; syphilitic atrophy,
8; cicatrices, 6; excavation with helminth, 1.Berenger-Feraud (1883)
reports of 411 fatal cases of dysentery observed at Senegal that the
liver appeared sound to the naked eye 98 times (23 per cent.)and
diseased "undeniably" 313 times (77 per cent.).Of the 313 cases of
hepatic affection there were found--hypertrophy, softening, or
hyperaemia, 123 times (39 per cent.); abscess, 143 times (46 per
cent.); simple discoloration, 29 times (9 per cent.); atrophy or
cirrhosis, 18 times (6 per cent.).Annesley found abscess of the liver
21 times in 29 cases of dysentery; Hospel, 13 times in 25 cases; and
Budd found ulceration of the large intestine 10 times in 17 cases of
hepatic abscess.Gluck had the opportunity of making 28 post-mortem
examinations in 151 cases of dysentery in Bucharest, finding abscess of
the liver 16 times.All these authors adopt the explanation first
offered by Budd of direct transfer of diseased products through the
mesenteric and portal veins.But more extensive observation has developed the fact that the
frequency of abscess of the liver in connection with dysentery is a
peculiarity of tropical climates.In the temperate and colder regions
of the North this complication is not by any means so frequent.Frerichs declares that of 16 observations collected by Louis and
Andral, "ulcers were present in only 3, and in 2 of these cases the
ulcers were tubercular; of his own 8 cases, there was intestinal
affection in none."Gluck believes that the liver is more prone to show
suppuration when already predisposed to it by a preceding amyloid or
cirrhotic change of malarial origin.Eichhorst calls attention to the
well-known fact that abscess of the liver is especially a disease of
the tropics independently of dysentery, and the frequency of its
occurrence here may be a mere coincidence.But it must be remembered
that opportunity for post-mortem examination, upon the {802} results of
which these statistics are based, does not occur in the great majority
of cases of dysentery, and abscess of the liver is very often
overlooked.Thus, Schneider cites cases where persons with abscess of
the liver of the size of the head were considered simulants up to
twenty-four hours before death.Since the diagnosis of hepatic abscess
has been made so easy by aspiration, cases begin to multiply; and it is
doubtless the experience of most practitioners, in the temperate zone
at least, that the decided majority of cases of hepatic abscess
acknowledge an existing or previous attack of dysentery.Certainly, few
authors would now venture to subscribe to the view of Annesley, that
the abscess of the liver was the primary malady and was the cause of
the dysentery.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Dysentery, as stated, begins, as a rule, with the
general signs of a gastro-intestinal catarrh.So frequent is this mode
of inception, and so few are the exceptions, that it is impossible to
resist the conclusion that the disease is caused by the introduction of
a noxious element into the alimentary canal.The irritation thus
induced begins at the stomach, and is rapidly propagated throughout the
whole tract of the intestine.In the course of a few days the cause of
the disease becomes strictly localized to the large intestine, whose
greater capacity and more sluggish movement fit it for the easier
reception and longer retention of noxious matter.But specific dysentery and the more intense forms of catarrhal
dysentery occasionally exhibit distinctive symptoms from the start, and
in rarer cases the disease is suddenly announced with such tempestuous
signs as to excite the suspicion of poisoning.Thus, a case (one of
five lighter cases) is reported from the Rudolfstiftung in Vienna
(1878) where the disease closely simulated Asiatic cholera, and where
it rapidly ran a fatal course, in spite of laudanum, soda-water, ice
pills, mustard plasters, injections of amyl nitrite, camphor, and
ether, and faradization of the phrenic nerve to stimulate the failing
respiration.Finger reports similar cases from the hospital at Prague.Ordinarily, the peculiar pains of dysentery first proclaim the
character of the disease.The severe grinding, twisting pains, tormina,
are more or less localized in the course of the colon, and hence
surround or traverse the entire abdomen, the pains at the epigastrium
being due to spasmodic contractions of the transverse colon.The
patient in vain adopts various postures in relief or sits with his
hands firmly compressing the abdominal walls.The tormina are more or
less intermittent or remittent, and are usually experienced in greatest
severity toward evening.During their acme the face wears the aspect of
the intense suffering, which is expressed in outcries and groans.At
the same time there is upon pressure over the whole abdomen more or
less tenderness, which soon comes to be especially localized at the
caecum or sigmoid flexure.The tenesmus (cupiditas egerendi) is a more distressing, and certainly
more distinctive, sign of dysentery.It is the feeling of heavy weight
or oppression, of the presence of a foreign body in the rectum, which
demands instant relief.At the same time intense heat is felt in the
rectum, which the patient likens sometimes to the passage of a red-hot
iron.The desire of evacuation becomes as frequent as urgent.In
well-marked cases the patient sits at stool half an hour or an hour at
a time, straining until faint {803} and exhausted, leaving the commode
with reluctance, only immediately or very soon to use it again.Great depression is felt at the stomach at the same time, with nausea,
occasionally with vomiting; and strangury, with the discharge of only a
few drops of scalding urine or blood from the bladder, adds additional
suffering to the disease.Retraction of the testicle and prolapsus ani,
especially in children, are prone to occur in severe cases.But neither the pain nor the prostration is so characteristic of
dysentery as the stools, which, though of very varied nature, are
nevertheless distinctive.After the discharge of the intestinal
contents the first evacuations consist of mucus in the form of glairy,
stringy matter, like the white of an egg, expressed as the result of
the violent efforts at straining.The mucus may be pure or tinged with
blood, but it is usually very scant in quantity, and stands in this
regard in marked contrast with the violence of the efforts to secure
its extrusion.It is the frequency of its discharge which constitutes
an especial distress.Twenty to forty, even two hundred, times in the
twenty-four hours the patient must go to stool.In the worst cases the
patient sits at stool or lies upon the bed-pan the most of the day.The mucus is sooner or later mingled with pus or stained with blood.The presence of pus by no means necessarily implies the existence of
ulceration, as the apparently pure mucus always shows occasional white
blood-corpuscles under the microscope, and even extensive suppurations
occur without apparent solutions of continuity.The presence of blood is equally characteristic of dysenteric stools.Usually it is intimately commingled with the mucus or pus or forms the
chief element of the copious so-called bilious discharge.The
evacuation of pure blood indicates erosion of vessels low in the colon,
often in the rectum itself, though enormous quantities of blood are
sometimes voided from unbroken surfaces.Thus Lecard reports the case
of a soldier who "while sitting restless at stool lost one and a half
quarts of blood."The patient died on the fifth day of the disease, and
at the autopsy there was found "apoplectiform congestion from the
ileo-caecal valve to the anus, but no ulcers anywhere, nor any broken
vessels."Besides the mucus, pus, and blood, the dysenteric stools contain the
sloughs which have been torn off by violent peristalsis in cases of the
diphtheritic form.Usually they are separated in shreds and fragments,
but occasionally large sheets, even casts of a section of the colon,
are voided en masse.These were the cases considered by the older
authors to be detachments of the mucous membrane itself.As already
observed, these fragments consist for the most part of inspissated
mucus, pus, blood, and tissue-debris; but there is no doubt that in
some cases partially necrosed mucosa also enters into their
construction.One enormous tubular cast fourteen inches long, preserved
in our Army Medical Museum, was found to be "composed of
pseudo-membranous lymph in which no traces of the structure of the
mucous membrane could be detected" (Woodward).There still remains to be mentioned the boiled-sago or frogs'-spawn
matter whose origin has given rise to such a curious mistake.Not
infrequently these vitreous-looking bodies compose the bulk of the
sediment in the stools of dysentery, and even some of our modern
authors, {804} unacquainted with the more searching investigations of
Virchow, have regarded them as expressed contents of intestinal
follicles.Virchow found that under the application of iodine they
always assumed a blue color, whereupon he ironically remarks that the
sago-like mucus is really mucus-like sago.They are simply granules of
starch ingested as food, to remain partially or wholly undigested.The scybalae, the composite matter known as the lotura carnea, and the
micro-organisms found in the stools have already received mention
elsewhere.Although the stools of dysentery are scant, as a rule, they are so
frequent as to discharge during the entire twenty-four hours a very
large quantity of albuminous matter.Oesterlen has made the curious
calculation to show that the mean daily loss of albuminates in
dysentery of moderate intensity is from 50 to 60 grammes during the
first fourteen days, and on an average about 20 grammes during the next
eight days.The total loss experienced in an attack of three weeks'
duration thus amounts to about 1000 grammes--in rough figures, two
pounds avoirdupois.The rapidity with which emaciation, hydrops, and
marasmus occur in severe cases is thus easily accounted for.Nagele
speaks of cases where patients were reduced to skeletons in eight to
fourteen days, so that the convalescence extended over six weeks to
eight months.The alteration in the character of the secretion in dysentery is not
confined to the mucous membrane of the large intestine.On the
contrary, all the digestive juices are changed, in some cases entirely
checked.In the graver cases the saliva takes on an acid reaction and
loses its glycogenic properties; the gastric juice in the same cases
becomes alkaline and loses its peptonizing properties; while the
secretion of the bile is wholly arrested.Uffelmann, who had the rare
opportunity of studying the secretion of bile in a case of biliary
fistula, relates that during an attack of dysentery the bile ceased
entirely to flow, and only began to show itself again, at first
greenish, then greenish-brown, finally brown, during the process of
resolution on the ninth day of the disease.The anorexia, nausea, and
vomiting which so often mark the access or attend the course of
dysentery find thus easy explanation.Should the disease continue, the general strength of the patient
becomes so profoundly reduced as to resemble the status typhosus.The
tongue, which has been hitherto thickly coated, now becomes black,
shows fissures, and bleeds, while the gums are covered with sordes.The
pulse becomes feeble, thready, or barely perceptible.The skin is dry
and harsh or scaly.The abdomen is tumid or collapsed, the anus
paralyzed, and the discharges continuously ooze out to excoriate the
perineum.While the brain is usually clear throughout the disease,
insomnia, stupor, or coma develop in the gravest cases from absorption
of disease-products (Senator), or death suddenly ensues from heart-clot
or from thrombus of the venous sinuses of the dura mater (Busey).Pyaemia announces itself with a series of chills, followed by irregular
temperature, by the speedy occurrence of multiple abscesses in distant
organs, venous thromboses, affections of the serous membranes,
pleuritis, pericarditis, and embolic pneumonia.Gangrene of the
intestine, which may occur as early as the third day of the disease
(Nagele), is evidenced by the signs of general collapse.{805} COMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELAE.--The lighter cases of dysentery, as
well as most of the grave cases, run their entire course without
complication, and often without sequelae.But a certain percentage of
cases is attended with complications on the part of the joints
(rheumatism), of the nervous system (paralysis), and on the part of the
liver and the kidneys.Arthritis, when it occurs, shows itself, as a rule, in the second week
of the disease (Eichhorst), or after the disease has run its course,
during the period of convalescence (Huelte).That it is not a mere
coincidence is evidenced by the fact that it is present in a large
number of cases in certain epidemics, while it is not present
independently of dysentery.Thus, Braun of Stannenheim saw in the two
epidemics of 1833-34 more than forty cases of rheumatism, and Huelte
reports ten cases observed by himself in the epidemic at Montargis in
1854.Certain epidemics are distinguished by the rarity of this
complication, while most are marked by its absence altogether.In the
epidemic at Rahden (1872), 400 cases among 3800 inhabitants, Rapmund
saw inflammation of the joints set in only six times; and the entire
absence or extreme rarity of it in later epidemics have led most
physicians to deny any connection between the diseases, or to regard
the joint affection as incident to a complicating scorbutus or
neuralgia.All authors who admit it describe the knee-joint as being
the most frequent seat of the affection, but acknowledge that it is
mostly polyarticular; while there is much difference of opinion whether
it ever presents the general signs of true rheumatism--pyrexia,
diaphoresis, or its complications on the part of the heart.Huelte
maintains that it does not, and that it is allied to gonorrhoeal
rheumatism in this respect, while Eichhorst states that it may not only
show all these signs, but may be followed in exceptional cases by
suppuration and ankylosis.It usually lasts four to six weeks, but
neither its occurrence nor its severity stands in any relation to the
intensity of the attack of dysentery.It is probably to be regarded as
a manifestation of a light pyaemia or septicaemia, as it is a frequent
manifestation of this condition in or after scarlatina, puerperal
fever, and the septic fevers of surgery.Paralysis has been observed to occur after dysentery ever since the
days of Galen, and, disregarding the observations of ancient and of the
older periods of modern times, we find occasional records of cases in
our own days.Leyden,[6] in reporting a case of paresis and rheumatic
pains following an attack of dysentery, says that although
post-dysenteric paralysis is now rarely mentioned, it was frequent in
the older reports, and claims it as an admitted fact that it occurs not
at all infrequently now.Joseph Frank quotes some observations of this
kind, and refers especially to the dissertation of Fabricius.[7] These
paralyses, Fabricius observes, have been seen after the premature
suppression of malignant epidemics of dysentery by opiates and
astringents.Observations were afterward recorded by Graves in which
paralysis occurred after colics and inflammation of the intestines; and
English veterinary surgeons mention the fact that paralytic weakness of
the posterior extremities of horses and cattle follow attacks of
intestinal inflammation.The paralysis, when it occurs, is usually
confined to the lower extremities, but may extend to {806} and involve
the upper extremities, by preference in the form of paralysis
transversa (opposite arm and leg).Brown-Sequard attributes it to
reflex contraction of the blood-vessels; Jaccoud, to exhaustion of the
nerve-centres; and Roser, to the contact of the inflamed transverse
colon with the solar plexus.Remak first suggested the idea of an
ascending neuritis--a view which would seem to be corroborated by the
paralysis observed after the experiments, by Lewisson, of crushing the
uterus, kidneys, bladder, or loop of intestine, and which finds
additional support, as Leyden remarks, in the length of time which
lapses before it appears.Landouzy[8] says that Finger found diffuse
myelitis in a patient affected with paralysis supervening upon cancer
of the intestine, and that Delioux and Savignac saw spots of softening
in the cervical and lumbar region of the cord in the case of a man
affected with post-dysenteric paralysis.Weir Mitchell suggests the
possibility of other factors--long marches, malaria, bad diet, and
injuries to the spine--in the genesis of the cases, mostly paraplegias,
observed by him; and Woodward calls attention to lead-poisoning (as by
treatment) in explanation of a certain number of cases.[Footnote 6: "On Reflex Paralysis," _Volkmann's Sammlungen_.][Footnote 7: _Paralysis seu hemiplegia transversa resolutionem brachii
unius et pedis alterius exhibet_, Helmstedt, 1750.][Footnote 8: _Des Paralysies dans les Maladies aigues_.]Abscess of the liver gives rise to few distinctive symptoms, and is
mostly recognized or suspected, in the absence of positive signs, by
the persistence or obstinacy of the dysentery.The ease and impunity
with which aspiration may be performed in its recognition justifies the
use of it in every doubtful case.Regarding complications on the part of the kidneys, Zimmerman
recognizes four classes of cases: (1) mild cases, showing no albumen
and no casts; (2) severe, long-continued cases, with putrid stools,
status nervosus, and collapse, showing albumen; (3) cases commencing
with nervous symptoms, paralysis, scanty urine, showing kidneys filled
with exudation-cells and detritus; and (4) cases of speedy renal
complication and death.To these may be added the cases of protracted
chronic dysentery with long-continued suppuration, entailing the
possibility, of really rare actual occurrence, of amyloid degeneration
and chronic parenchymatous change (Bartels).Dysentery may be further complicated by parotitis; by venous thrombosis
(phlegmasia dolens); by diphtheritic deposits on other mucous surfaces,
which Virchow declares to be exceedingly rare; and by hydrops, which is
oftener a concomitant of the period of convalescence.Besides the deformities of the colon, which may ensue as a consequence
of ulceration or peritonitis, a long attack of dysentery is apt to
leave a hyperaesthetic or non-resistant state of the mucous surface, so
that every imprudence in exposure or in diet begets an intestinal
catarrh or a relapse of the disease.DIAGNOSIS.--When dysentery presents itself with its whole train of
symptoms the recognition of the disease is very easy.The tormina and
tenesmus, the peculiar discharges, the rapid reduction of strength,
leave no doubt as to the nature of the affection.The prevalence of an
epidemic of the disease will often establish the character of a case
even when all the signs are not present or when anomalies occur.Embarrassment in diagnosis only attends the recognition of catarrhal or
isolated cases, and in these cases there may be a doubt as between
dysentery and {807} diarrhoea--if such a symptom can be called a
disease--or typhoid fever, cholera, or some purely local affection of
the rectum, cancer, hemorrhoids, etc.In children difficulty of
diagnosis may arise as between dysentery and intussusception.Dysentery is differentiated from that lighter form of intestinal
catarrh whose main symptom is diarrhoea by the presence of tenesmus in
dysentery, as well as by its mucous, muco-purulent, diphtheritic, and
bloody discharges.Dysentery lasts longer than diarrhoea as a rule, and
does not yield so readily to treatment.Typhoid fever shows from the start brain symptoms, which are absent
from dysentery; has a typical temperature-curve, whereas there may be
no fever in dysentery, or, if any, of irregular remittent type; is
often prefaced by epistaxis and attended with bronchitis, both of which
are absent in dysentery; and exhibits ochre- pea-soup stools,
altogether different from those of dysentery.Cholera morbus distinguishes itself from dysentery by its sudden onset,
its profuse vomiting and discharges, its violent cramps, and the speedy
collapse.Cancer of the rectum can be usually felt, and hemorrhoids can be always
seen, so that no difficulty should be experienced in the recognition of
these cases.Intussusception occurs mostly in children, and has, in common with
dysentery, vomiting, mucous or bloody stools, colic, tenesmus, nervous
unrest, and prostration, so that a differential diagnosis may be
impossible for a few days.The more strict localization of an
intussusception, which may sometimes be felt as a sausage-like mass,
most frequently in the right ileum and hypochondrium, the greater
frequency and persistency of the vomiting and pain, the presence
visibly or palpably of the invaginated gut at the anus or rectum, soon
enable the careful examiner to recognize the case.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of dysentery varies between extremes.Some
cases are so mild as to merit the remark of Sydenham concerning certain
cases of scarlet fever: "Vix nomen morbi merebantur."They terminate of
themselves under favorable hygiene without especial treatment.On the
other hand, no known disease has a more frightful mortality than
dysentery in some of its epidemics, especially in army-life.It was
this class of cases which Trousseau had in mind when he called
dysentery the most murderous of all diseases.Sixty to eighty may be
the appalling percentage of death in these cases.Under favorable surroundings the average mortality of dysentery amounts
to 5-10 per cent., but is much influenced by the age and the general
condition of the patient, as well as by the complications which occur
in its course.Thus, Sydenham said of it over two hundred years ago,
"It is not infrequently fatal to adults, and still more so to old men,
but is nevertheless exceedingly harmless to infants, who will bear it
for months together without suffering, provided only Nature be left to
herself."But dysentery is by no means always harmless to infants, for
in some epidemics this period of life has been visited with the
greatest severity.Thus, Pfeilstucker reports of Wurtemberg (1873-74)
that the greatest mortality, 39 per cent., occurred at the age of one
to seven years, and the least, 4 per cent., at the age of thirty-one to
fifty years; {808} and Oesterlen says of England that dysentery causes
20 per cent.of deaths from all causes in the first year of life.Nor does the prevalence of a greater number of cases necessarily imply
a heavier mortality.For Bianchi reports of Rome that cases of
dysentery constituted but 2.28 per cent.of all the admissions into the
Ospedale di San Spirito in 1873, while in 1874 the percentage increased
to 3.68; yet the mortality of 1873 was 17.02 per cent., while that of
1874 was but 9.09 per cent.Complications on the part of the nervous system, the status typhosus,
pyaemia, and great prostration, necessarily render the prognosis grave,
yet even these cases are not necessarily fatal.Thus, Jules Aron
reports from the epidemic at Joigny (1876) a case of recovery after
complete paralysis of the sphincter ani.The recognition and discharge
of an hepatic abscess relieves the patient from the dangers of this
complication.Peritonitis alarmingly aggravates the prognosis, and
perforation is almost of necessity fatal.PROPHYLAXIS.--The improved sanitation of modern times has already
diminished the frequency and mitigated the severity of epidemics of
dysentery; and this fact, which is only an accidental observation as it
were, gives the clue to the means of its further prevention.The selection of proper sites for camping-grounds, barracks, and
hospitals, the prevention of overcrowding in tenement-houses, ships,
and jails, the regulation of sewage, the care for the food and drink,
the observation of the strictest cleanliness by authoritative
control,--all these are general measures which suggest themselves in
the prophylaxis of this or any disease.In the management of individual cases the first precaution is to
prevent the dissemination of the disease.Whether it be really
contagious or not, every case should be managed, as Bamberger suggests,
as though it were contagious; and this protection of others secures for
the individual patient the most favorable hygiene.The bedding must be frequently changed; the windows kept open to secure
free ventilation, which, in the light of existing knowledge, is the
only true disinfectant; and all the furniture of the sick-room,
especially including the receptacles for the discharges, must be kept
perfectly clean.For this purpose the best purifier is very hot water.The temperature of the sick-chamber, if it be subject to regulation,
should never be allowed to sink below or rise above 65-70 degrees F.

The drinking-water should be secured, during an epidemic, from the
purest possible source, and if good drinking-water cannot be had, what
there is should be thoroughly boiled.The discharges should properly be mixed with sawdust or some
combustible substance and burned, or if this be impracticable should be
buried in the soil a few feet below the surface, and not emptied into
water-closets or privy-vaults used by others.Such articles of food should be abjured as have a tendency to produce
intestinal catarrh.So unripe fruits, vegetables which readily undergo
fermentation--in short, all indigestible substances--should stand under
ban.But no prohibition should be put upon ripe fruits or simple
nutritious food of any kind.Lastly, individuals should protect themselves from catching cold.The
{809} researches of Pasteur have disclosed the fact that certain germs
of disease will grow and multiply in the body of an animal whose
temperature is reduced, when they would not increase without it.TREATMENT.--The first requisite in the treatment of an individual case
is perfect rest.Patients with even the lighter forms of catarrhal
dysentery should observe the recumbent posture, and cases of more
serious illness should be put to bed.Rest in bed, an exclusive diet of
milk--which should always have been boiled--and the time of a few days
is sufficient treatment for the mildest cases.Where there is objection
to milk, meat-soups, with or without farinaceous matters, rice, barley,
etc., may take its place.A case which is somewhat more severe will require perhaps a light
saline laxative--a Seidlitz powder, a dose of Rochelle salts or Epsom
salts in broken doses--or a tablespoonful of castor oil or five to ten
grains of calomel, to effect a cure.For the relief of the pain of the
lighter cases nothing is equal to tincture of opium, of which five to
ten drops every three or four hours in a tablespoonful of camphor-water
acidulated with a few drops of nitric acid will generally suffice; or
Dover's powder in broken doses, one to three grains, with five to
fifteen grains of bismuth or soda, or both, is a good substitute for a
change.The successful treatment of dysentery in any form depends upon a
recognition of the fact that the disease is local as to its seat, and
is probably specific as to its cause.The anodynes relieve the effects,
but the laxatives remove the cause.Consequently, the most rational
treatment of the severer cases is the irrigation of the large intestine
and the thorough flushing out of its contents.The use of clysters in
the treatment of dysentery dates from the most ancient times, with the
object, however, rather of medicating than washing out the bowel.O'Beirne (1834) and Hare (1849) were the authors of the irrigation
treatment, which they executed by means of a long tube introduced into
and beyond the sigmoid flexure.Since Hegar has recently shown how the
whole tract of the large intestine can be thoroughly inundated and
flushed with a common funnel and rectal tube, the practice has
continually gained ground, until it is now admitted as the most
valuable method of treatment.H. C. Wood of Philadelphia, and later
Stephen Mackenzie of London, have reported a number of cases in which
irrigation of the bowel with large injections medicated with nitrate of
silver, drachm j-pint j, was attended with the most surprising
results--sometimes but a single injection effecting a cure; and the
writer of this article has reported one case almost in articulo mortis
where complete cure followed the irrigation of the bowel--on three
occasions with three pints of water containing three drachms of common
alum.This case was all the more instructive from the fact that a
relapse had occurred after very striking but only temporary relief had
been obtained with the nitrate of silver, the alum having been
substituted simply on the ground of expense.Salicylic acid has also been extensively employed in this way with the
best effects, but carbolic acid has been discarded since the reports of
several cases of poisoning have been published.Should it become a
question of the necessity of a parasiticide, the bichloride of mercury
in extremely dilute solution, 1 to 1000, would be the agent par
excellence; but it is probable that the simple flushing of the bowel is
the chief {810} curative agent.The use of alum is not attended with
the dangers which have ensued from the absorption of carbolic acid, and
which might ensue from the bichloride of mercury.The water used in the
injections should always be cold.Ice-water injections alone give at
times the greatest relief.Wenzel uses injections of ice-water in all
recent and acute cases, whether slight or severe--in bad cases every
two hours.The object is to
introduce as much water as possible without producing too much pain.The large intestine of an adult holds, on an average, six imperial
pints, but in the author's experience not more than three or four pints
can be safely introduced.The patient should lie upon the back or the
left side with the hips elevated and the head low, while the injection
is slowly introduced from a funnel, fountain, or a bulb syringe whose
nozzle is thoroughly anointed with vaseline.In the absence of a
thoroughly competent assistant the operation should be performed by the
physician himself, for the proper use of an irrigating enema is a
practice which requires both judgment and skill.When pain is
experienced, the further influx of the fluid should cease for a few
minutes, when it may be resumed again and again until the largest
possible quantity is introduced.It is impossible to over-estimate the
value of this treatment in cleansing, disinfecting, and constringing
the foul and flabby surface of the whole seat of the disease.As was
said by Hare, "It changes a huge internal into an external abscess, and
enables us to cleanse the bowel of its putrid contents."Of all the remedies which have been recommended in the relief of
dysentery besides the irrigation method, but one, ipecacuanha, deserves
the name of a specific.This remedy was first introduced into practice
in 1648 by the botanist Piso, who was led to adopt it from the popular
praise he had heard of it while travelling in Brazil.He considered it
the most exquisite gift of nature, and administered it in infusion
according to the Brazilian (subsequently known as the French) method.Legros made three successive voyages to South America to import
supplies of the drug to France, but neither he nor the French merchant
Grenier, who had brought over more than one hundred and fifty pounds of
it, could secure its general use.Thereupon, Grenier acquainted Adrian
Helvetius, a Dutch physician practising in Paris at the time, with the
wonderful virtues of the Radix dysenterica, who, having experimented
with it first upon patients of the lower classes, was later successful
in curing the Dauphin of France.The further use of it, by permission
of the king, at the Hotel Dieu, enabled him to secure a monopoly of its
sale and secured for him a grant of a thousand pounds.Grenier hereupon
put in his claim for a division of the profits, and upon the refusal of
Helvetius instituted suit to obtain his rights.Justly indignant at the
loss of his suit, he revealed the secret, and ipecacuanha became common
property at once.Extravagant ideas were now entertained of its value,
but in the extreme reaction which followed every virtue of it was
disavowed, so that the drug came to be almost forgotten.From this
temporary oblivion the remedy was rescued by an English army surgeon,
E. Scott Docker, in 1858, who administered it, in combination with
laudanum, in his regiment, on the island of Mauritius, in all cases and
stages of the disease with such success that out of fifty cases he lost
but one.Although such indiscriminate use and such almost unvaried
success has not attended, and from the nature {811} of different cases
could not attend, its universal employment, there is no doubt of the
inestimable value of the service rendered in the restoration of the
remedy in the treatment of dysentery.Yet over twenty years elapsed
before its author received from his country, at the urgent solicitation
of the Director-General, in recognition of this service, a grant of
four hundred pounds.Remarkable testimony as to its efficiency soon began to appear.Ewart[9] recommends ipecacuanha in every form and type of acute
dysentery, as well as in the acute attacks supervening upon chronic
cases.Its advantages are simplicity, safety, comparative certainty,
promptitude of action, decrease of chronic cases and of complications,
especially abscess of the liver, and great reduction of mortality."It
produces all the benefits that have been ascribed to bloodletting,
without robbing the system of one drop of blood; all the advantages of
mercurial and other purgatives, without their irritating action; all
the good results of antimony and other sudorifics, without their
uncertainty; all the benefits ascribed to opium, without irritating, if
not aggravating or masking, the disease."To the objections urged
against it he replies that the nausea is only temporary and
evanescent--that vomiting is exceptional and of but short duration;
moreover, it permits nourishment and assimilation and produces sleep.If uncontrollable sickness and vomiting occur, they are probably due to
abscess of the liver, malaria, some other cachexia, Bright's disease,
strumous mesenteric glands, hypertrophy of the spleen, peritonitis, or
extensive sloughing.[Footnote 9: _Indian Annals Med.Cunningham prefaces the treatment by a sinapism to the epigastrium and
half a drachm of the tincture of opium.Then from one to one and a half
drachms of ipecacuanha are administered in powder.It causes
considerable nausea, and vomiting occurs in one to two hours.During
the nausea copious perspiration breaks out, the pulse becomes fuller,
softer, and less frequent, the tenesmus and abdominal pains cease, and
the patient has no more stools for twelve to twenty-four hours.The
next evacuation is easy, fluid, but free from blood or mucus.Sometimes
the dose of ipecacuanha may require to be repeated.Malun reports the results of treatment of 436 cases occurring in
twenty-one months.There were only 6 deaths, and in only 1 of these
could the remedy be fairly said to have failed.Under all other plans
of treatment the mortality has varied from 12 to 22.3 per cent.Docker says that the mortality of dysentery in the British army
during the ten years that followed the adoption of the ipecacuanha
treatment fell from 11 to 5 per cent.The remedy is best administered in large doses, 20 to 40 grains, and
should be repeated every four to twelve hours until permanent good
effects are secured.A dose of 15 to 30 drops of tincture of opium, or
morphia, one-fourth grain hypodermically, will best protect the patient
from too great exhaustion.The beneficial results are mostly obtained
in the acute cases, though surprising results sometimes follow in cases
of very long standing.Thus, Gayton records a case of severe chronic
dysentery of eighteen months' duration which was entirely cured by
ipecacuanha, and probably most physicians of large practice can recall
cases where the continual relapses of the dysenteric habit have been
completely broken up by {812} one course of active treatment.Should
the remedy fail to be of service in the course of forty-eight hours, it
should be discontinued.Batiator, the bark of the root of the Ailanthus glandulosa; mudar, the
bark of the root of the Calotropis gigantea; and bael-fruit, more
especially in chronic cases,--have been proposed by Roberts, Duval,
Chuckerbutty, and others as substitutes for ipecacuanha, but are not
likely to soon supplant it.Materia medica is rich in drugs whose virtues have been vaunted in
dysentery, and cases occur where the judicious physician will make his
selection according to the indications in a given case.Turpentine
internally, as well as externally in the form of a stupe (Copland), has
had advocates from ancient times; astringents, tannic acid or the
substances which contain it, kino, catechu, krameria; the acetate of
lead, nitrate of silver, etc.; antiseptics, carbolic acid, salicylic
acid, boracic acid; anodynes, opium and its preparations; and
quinia,--are among the agents most frequently employed.Bonjean (1870) had occasion to laud the efficacy of ergotin in checking
hemorrhage and controlling the discharges in a report which
substantiates the claim of Rilliet and Lombard in the epidemic at
Geneva in 1853.Massolez had the same good results in the war of the
Crimea, as had also Andrea in the Spanish hospitals of Ceuta and
Tetuan.Clysters of nitrate of silver, 4 grains to 5 ounces of water (Duchs),
or with a few drops of tincture of opium (Berger); of ipecacuanha
(Begbie and Duckworth); of laudanum and starch (Sydenham, Abercrombie);
of the various astringents,--may be tried in obstinate, more especially
chronic, cases.Local inspection of the rectum by means of the speculum may possibly
reveal an ulcer, which is the chief or sole cause of the tenesmus and
bloody discharge.Maury reports such a case in which the ulcer was deep
enough to hide a small sponge.In such cases topical treatment may
effect a cure.Dilatation may suffice to overcome a stricture in the rectum, the
result of cicatricial contraction, or colotomy may be necessary in
cases more refractory or situated higher in the bowel.Post[10]
reported a successful colotomy, with the formation of an artificial
anus in the left lumbar region, in such a case.The food should be fluid, but nutritious, and milk best fulfils both
these requisites.Where milk cannot be tolerated it may be substituted
by soups, beef-tea, mutton-broths, chicken-soup, etc.But it should be
known of these substitutes that they contain little or no nutritious
matter on account of the insolubility of the albuminoids, and are
really only stimulants.Soft-boiled egg, thin custards, sweetbreads,
scraped or chopped raw beef--albumen thus in substance--constitute the
best food.But during the intensity of an attack the patient should
almost altogether abstain from food, both from lack of inclination for
it and from lack of ability to digest it.During convalescence the food
should be on the basis of animal diet, though ripe fruits and fresh
succulent vegetables should not be altogether withheld.In all cases of pronounced prostration stimulants are to be freely
used, and of all stimulants alcohol is the best, as it has also
nutritive and {813} antiseptic properties.Alcohol is thus triply
indicated in the treatment of dysentery, but the choice of the form and
strength will be a matter of judgment in the individual case.Where life is imperilled by hemorrhage or anaemia from any cause, a
forlorn hope is offered in transfusion, which in the hands of C.
Schmidt (1874) has proved successful in two cases.Abscess of the liver is best treated by aspiration or hepatotomy;
rheumatism, by the salicylates; and paralysis, by the constant current
of electricity.Obstinate cases of chronic or continually recurring dysentery are
thoroughly cured only by a sea-voyage, a sojourn at the seashore, a
mountain-excursion, or a permanent change of climate.{814}

TYPHLITIS, PERITYPHLITIS, PARATYPHLITIS.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.HISTORY.--Typhlitis ([Greek: typhlos], blind), inflammation of or about
the head of the colon, more especially the vermiform process, is a
disease of modern recognition.Individual cases had been reported as
curiosities where foreign bodies or fecal accumulations had excited
inflammation in this part of the intestine, but it is undoubtedly to
Dupuytren[1] that the credit is due of having first individualized this
disease as a separate affection.About the same time (1827) Longer
Villermay published his communications in the _Archives gen._, t. v.246, on the diseases of the vermiform process, to be followed in the
same year by Melier[2] and Hussar and Dance with observations on
inflammation of the connective tissue in the region of the caecum.These affections, which had been hitherto described as inflammatory
tumors in the right iliac region, now received from Puchelt[3] the
distinct name perityphlitis.[Footnote 1: _Lecons oral de Cliniq.[Footnote 2: _Arch, gen._, Sept., 1827.][Footnote 3: _Heidelberg klin.Perhaps the most remarkable events in the history of these affections
since this time are the contributions of Stokes and Petrequin (1837) on
the value of opium in the treatment of perforation of the vermiform
appendix, of Albers,[4] who first distinguished the special form of
typhlitis stercoralis, and of Oppolzer (1858-64), who set apart,
perhaps as an unnecessary refinement in differential diagnosis, a
paratyphlitis, an inflammation of the post-caecal connective tissue.Matterstock[5] (1880) deserves especial mention for having given such
prominence to anomalies of the vermiform appendix in the etiology of
the affection; and Kraussold[6] (1881) has connected his name with the
therapy of the disease by the boldness with which he expresses his
convictions regarding the necessity of early evacuation, by incision,
of inflammatory products, as first practised by Willard Parker in 1843.aus dem Gebiete der Pathologie_, ii.[Footnote 5: _Handbuch d. Kinderkrank._, Bd.[Footnote 6: _Volkmann's Sammlung._, No.GENERAL REMARKS.--Typhlitis, strictly speaking, is limited to
affections of the caecum and its appendix vermiformis; perityphlitis is
mostly due to extension of the inflammation to the peritoneal envelope
of these organs; while paratyphlitis signifies an involvement of the
extra-peritoneal and post-caecal connective tissues.Both perityphlitis
and paratyphlitis are therefore secondary processes, though they may,
in exceptional cases, arise from affections of organs other than the
caecum, as from {815} perinephritis, psoitis, vertebral caries, or as
an expression of metastatic processes in pyaemia, septicaemia
(puerperal fever), typhoid fever, etc.ETIOLOGY.--Typhlitis and its allied affections or complications show
especial predilection for the male sex and the period of adolescence.Nearly three-fourths (733) of the whole number (1030) of cases of
perityphlitis collected from the literature by Matterstock were males,
and this proportion holds good in infancy and early youth as well as in
adolescence.The greatest number of cases, 33 per cent., occurred at
the ages of 21-30; next, 30 per cent., at 11-20; while the ratio
gradually decreases toward both extremes of life.So the opinion is
expressed with singular unanimity by all authors that these diseases
pre-eminently affect the bloom of life.The observation that typhlitis has so often been found to arise from
disease of the vermiform process has led to a closer study of its
anatomical relations, and developed the fact that this organ is subject
to great variation in size, shape, and situation.Normally, the appendix vermiformis arises from the posterior interior
aspect of the caecum as a tube of the diameter of a goosequill and a
length of three to six inches, with a general direction upward and
inward behind the caecum.It is commonly provided with a small
mesentery, which retains it in its place.Its cavity communicates with
the cavity of the caecum by a small orifice which is at times guarded
by a valvular fold of mucous membrane, while its free closed end
terminates abruptly in a blunt point.It is commonly found filled with
mucus throughout its entire length.The existence of this superfluous
structure, which is found only in man and certain of the higher apes,
has given rise to much speculation among the anatomists and
physiologists, especially of the teleological school, as to its
possible use.It is now, however, the generally acknowledged opinion
that the appendix vermiformis is a relic or rudiment of a subsidiary
stomach in lower forms of life.The head of the large intestine, which
forms almost an additional stomach in the Gramnivora, and is three
times the length of the whole body in the marsupial koala, is very much
reduced in the Carnivora, whose food contains but little indigestible
matter, and is greatly reduced in the Omnivora, as in man.The
vermiform appendix is the shrivelled remnant of the great caecal
receptaculum of the lower animals.In the orang it is still a long
convoluted tube, but in man it is reduced, as stated, to the size of a
quill three or four inches in length, and is often entirely absent.Kraussold, who complains that the vermiform process has hitherto
received only step-motherly treatment at the hands of anatomists and
clinicians, undertook a series of investigations which went to show how
often and what extreme anomalies do occur.In some cases the appendix
was disposed in an exactly opposite to the normal direction, its blind
end being turned upward along the ascending colon.In one case it was
found wound about the ileum; in another, spirally turned at its end and
lightly adherent to a hernial sac.Sometimes it was abnormally long or
short, open or closed with a valve, cylindrical, saccular, or bulbed,
fixed or free, curved or bent upon itself at a sharp angle, provided
with a short mesentery, and sometimes, as stated, it was entirely
absent.But by far the most interesting point connected with this organ was the
frequency with which it was found the seat of ulceration or stricture
{816} from cicatrization somewhere in its course, the result of
dysentery, typhoid fever, syphilis, and more especially of
tuberculosis.Clinicians who have been struck with the frequency with
which typhlitis has occurred in tuberculous subjects find in this
discovery a satisfactory explanation of this very remarkable
coincidence.Normally, the vermiform appendix is found filled, as stated, with a
tough vitreous mucus, but not infrequently masses of feces, foreign
bodies, intestinal worms, etc.find their way into it, where they may
remain innocuous or may excite a dangerous inflammation.This fact, in
connection with the general uselessness or superfluousness of this
structure, has led pathologists to characterize the vermiform process
with the significant appellation of a death-trap.Two anatomical factors deserve especial emphasis in explanation of the
frequent origin of disease in the vermiform appendix.One is the
existence of the valvular fold of mucous membrane, already mentioned,
at or near the orifice of the tube in the caecum, the clinical
importance of which was first pointed out by Gerlach.This fold is most
marked between the ages of three and twelve, and when pronounced
narrows the orifice to one-half or one-third of the whole calibre of
the tube.As a rule, this fold, and the consequent diminution in the
size of the orifice, are but little marked in the first years of life
and in old age, which accounts for the relative infrequency of
typhlitis at these periods of life.The second mechanical factor is the deformity caused by the abnormal
anatomical position of the organ, either as a congenital defect or as a
pathological change.Matterstock quotes from Zungel, who observed in 59
cases in the Hamburg hospital whole or partial obliteration 30 times,
catarrh and old fecal concretions 43 times, abnormal adhesions 12
times, and tubercular ulceration (without perforation) 11 times.Toft
claims as the result of 300 personal investigations that every third
person between the ages of twenty and seventy showed the traces of
present or past inflammation, and that actual ulceration existed in 5
per cent.Kraussold declares that this
percentage is rather too low than too high, and adds that among his
patients--who were, it should be stated, mostly phthisical--it was
remarkable how extraordinarily often the whole vermiform appendix was
the seat of an encroaching ulcer.In a number of cases cicatrices or
cicatricial alterations were found where typhoid fever or dysentery had
existed in the previous history.Attention should at least be called to a last anatomical factor in
explanation of the frequency of ulceration and inflammation of this
structure, in that its walls are so sparsely endowed with muscular
tissue as to render it unable to empty itself of the virus or germs of
disease which enter it from the comparatively stagnant reservoir, the
caecum.Constipation is usually invoked as a cardinal factor in the genesis of
typhlitis (typhlitis stercoralis).Speck calls attention to the
frequency of the disease in East Siberia, where the food, mostly
vegetable, contains a large amount of indigestible residue.But that
this condition cannot sufficiently account for the disease in most
cases is proved by the fact that constipation is more frequent in
advanced life and among females, in whom typhlitis with its associate
lesions is more infrequent.For the same reason a sedentary mode of
life loses force as an argument in its production.Perhaps the most
efficient cause of the condition is a local {817} paresis of the
muscular tissue of the caecum produced by the irritation of intestinal
catarrh, of disease virus, of a fecal concretion or a foreign body--an
irritation which may induce first a spasmodic action, and subsequently,
as a result, a partial paralysis or a paresis.The same condition may
be brought about more directly by the presence of a centre of
irritation--viz.Accumulation and
impaction of feces must then necessarily ensue, and it is highly
probable that this accumulation occurs in this way as a result more
frequently than as a cause of the condition.For the symptoms of a
simple accumulation of feces (coprostasis) are never so severe, at
least at the start, as to mark the onset of a genuine typhlitis.Nor is
there anything in healthy feces to induce the signs of a severe
blood-poisoning which so commonly announces the advent or course of
typhlitis.Room is here open for the surmise that most cases of typhlitis pur et
simple are due to the presence in the caecum of the germs or virus of
disease taken with the food or drink, and traversing innocuously the
whole length of the alimentary tract, to finally bring up in this most
stagnant part of the intestinal canal.The role of pure mechanical causes cannot be ignored or underrated in
perityphlitis, understanding by this division processes which commence
in the vermiform appendix.For it is the rule to discover in the
vermiform appendix in these cases either fecal concretions or foreign
bodies.Haeckel and Buhl found concretions of meconium in a new-born
child, and fecal concretions, intestinal stones, are far more
frequently encountered than foreign bodies.In 146 accurately observed
adult cases recorded by Matterstock, fecal concretions were met with 63
times, foreign bodies 9 times, while in the other cases nothing could
be discovered; and in 49 cases among children, fecal concretions were
discovered 27 times, foreign bodies 3 times, and nothing abnormal in
the remaining cases.Not infrequently a small foreign body acts as a
centre of crystallization for feces which become superimposed in
successive layers.Hairs, as of the beard, sometimes officiate in this
way.Among other foreign bodies met with in fatal cases of perforation,
independently of feces, may be mentioned round-worms (Faber),
cherry-stones (Paterson), needles (Payne), fish-bones (Zungel),
gall-stones (Hallete), a mass of ascarides (Klebs), buttons (Gerhardt),
etc., etc.As already intimated, supposed foreign bodies are often
found on examination to be nothing else than intestinal concretions.As
to cherry-stones, which are so often accused of producing typhlitis,
Biermer and Bossard found it difficult or impossible to force them into
the vermiform process.MORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions revealed upon the post-mortem table show
for the most part the ordinary picture of perforative peritonitis,
which is by far the most frequent cause of death.The peritoneum in the
vicinity of the perforation is found hyperaemic, swollen, necrosed,
covered with flakes of soft fibrin, or partially agglutinated to
contiguous structures.The wall of the bowel is very much thickened by
catarrhal swelling of its mucosa, proliferation of its submucous tissue
in more chronic cases, oedema of all its coats, or suppurative
processes.Not infrequently the mucous tissue is the seat of extensive
ulceration which may involve other structures of the gut or form an
abscess, even as large as a man's head, in its immediate vicinity.The
abscess may remain strictly localized or {818} may wander to discharge
itself into the ileum, caecum, duodenum, and diaphragm (Bamberger) with
resultant empyema (Duddenhausen), colon (Prudhomme), bladder (Bossard),
in which case the fecal concretion became the nucleus for a vesical
stone; acetabulum (Aubry), inferior vena cava (Demaux), or peritoneal
cavity, the most frequent eventuality.Duddenhausen saw in one case a
pylephlebitis result, Von Buhl a pylephlebitis and metastatic liver
abscess, which condition, Matterstock says, is noted 11 times in 146
autopsies; and older writers speak of discharges into the pleural sac,
into the lungs, pericardium, uterus, vagina, etc.A curious case was
observed by Eichhorst in Frerichs' clinic, where pus found escape
through the umbilicus.So cases of burrowing sinuses with abscesses at
distant seats, as in the groin or lumbar region, fistulae with
continuous discharge, and other curiosities, may be found among the
records by the curious.In cases of more acute course the lesions are often found centred about
the vermiform appendix.The most various contortions, adhesions, or
erosions are observed in this structure.Occasionally a constriction
occludes the course of the tube, while the distal end is dilated into a
condition of hydrops.It may be found perforated in one or in several
places.The cicatrices or agglutinations of old attacks may be
encountered; it may be cut in two or three pieces (Matterstock), or
have been entirely absorbed.Kraussold records a case of this kind in a
colleague who died of typhlitis.Upon the post-mortem table no trace of
the vermiform appendix could be encountered except a dimple on the
mucous surface of the caecum, indicating the site of its former
orifice.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Typhlitis announces itself in two ways--suddenly and
insidiously.In adults the disease begins as a rule with violent signs;
in children there is often a prodromatous stage which may last for days
or for months before a positive diagnosis can be established.There are
in these cases anorexia and vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea,
colicky pains, mostly concentrated about the ileo-caecal region.There
are at this time a disinclination to stand or walk, a stooped posture
or gait, occasionally a light icterus, a feeling of formication or
paresis in the right leg, and lastly an increased resistance or a
palpable tumor in the right ileum.In the adult the disease is wont to begin with more tempestuous signs.Not infrequently it is ushered in with a well-marked chill, upon which
immediately supervenes a sharp pain at the affected region.A general
collapse of strength soon follows, with fever, thirst, a husky voice, a
coated tongue, vomiting, singultus, and an expression of anxiety.The
impression of serious illness becomes apparent at once.The case early
bears the aspect of a grave infectious disease.A constant, dull,
boring, gnawing, or lancinating pain in the right iliac region first
excites the suspicion of the physician as to the real nature of the
disease.In children the pain is sometimes felt first in the
epigastrium; in three cases mentioned by Buchner, Herzfelder, and
Traube it was first experienced in the left ileum.There may be at this
time no tumor, but there is increased resistance to pressure and
exquisite tenderness to touch in the neighborhood of the caecum.The
whole abdomen is more or less tender, and often tumid.If there should
be also gurgling from displacement of gas, doubt is excited as to the
possible existence of typhoid fever.{819} In the course of a few days the tumor takes shape.A typhlitis
stercoralis shows a distension of the whole ascending colon, a
sausage-shaped tumor, smooth or nodulated, along the entire right side
of the abdomen, with increased resistance also in the transverse colon.More frequently in typhlitis--and, as a rule, in peri- and
paratyphlitis--the tumor or tumefaction is more localized about the
head of the colon.Frequently the swelling is so great as to be visible
as a protrusion or bulging of the affected region.Percussion shows
dulness, tanquam femoris, in cases of pure typhlitis, whereas in peri-,
and more especially in paratyphlitis, there is tympanites on light and
dulness only on deep percussion.Palpation or palpatory auscultation
occasionally, though very rarely, reveals a peritoneal friction sound
(Gerhardt).The third cardinal symptom of the disease is the disturbance of
digestion, which, as stated, often precedes or attends the first
manifestation of the pain and the tumor.Anorexia, nausea, and
vomiting--which is in the last stage of the disease often substituted
by singultus--present themselves as occasional or constant signs of the
disease.Constipation remains as a rule throughout the whole course of
the disease with an obstinacy which sometimes excites apprehension of
an intestinal occlusion; or the constipation may alternate with
diarrhoea or dysenteric phenomena, more especially in the earlier
stages.The tongue is, as a rule, heavily coated, or in typhoid states
is dry, glazed, or fissured, and sordes covers the teeth and gums.Fever is not a necessary factor in typhlitis, but when present
distinguishes itself by its irregular range.The pulse is usually
accelerated, full, and hard; the skin is dry and harsh; the urine is
scanty and high-, and contains "almost without exception
unusually large quantities of indican" (Eichhorst).Perforation, when it occurs, is usually recognized at once by the signs
of more or less immediate collapse, which quickly results in death.The abdomen becomes suddenly distended, meteoric over its entire
surface, the normal hepatic dulness giving place to a tympanitic
resonance.Not infrequently perforation occurs as the result of an accident, as
after a push or blow upon the abdomen (Volz), heavy lifting
(Volperling), riding in a wagon (Marsh), after dancing (Cless), mere
turning of the body in bed (Langdon Downs), after emesis (Urban),
purgation (Stokes), enema (Melier), etc., etc.That the slightest
agitation may suffice at times to break down the last barrier of serous
tissue separating the intestinal and peritoneal cavity is shown in the
case recorded by With, where fatal perforative peritonitis occurred
after a fit of immoderate laughter.Paratyphlitis distinguishes itself from the other forms of the disease
by its more insidious character.There is also in paratyphlitis, as a
rule, less disturbance in the alimentary canal.The caecum in
paratyphlitis is mostly empty or is filled with gas, whose presence is
recognized by tympanitic resonance on lighter percussion.On the other
hand, paratyphlitis is characterized by the greater frequency of
pressure signs in the right lower extremity.If the subjacent iliac and
psoas muscles be implicated, the thigh is flexed upon the leg in
decubitus.Various paraesthesiae, formication, numbness, pain, and
veritable paresis are experienced in the right leg.Dysuria, retraction
of the testicle, and priapism may also occur in this form of the
disease.Or pressure upon the iliac vein {820} induces thrombosis, with
oedema, milk leg.The long-continued process of suppuration in
paratyphlitis leads also at times to hectic fever or pyaemia, with slow
marasmus.In all cases relapses are very frequent, as repeated occurrences of the
disease constitute the rule.Eichhorst records the case of a
court-officer who suffered five attacks of paratyphlitis in the short
space of one and a half years.DIAGNOSIS.--The recognition of the disease is mostly simple.The pain,
the tumor, and the disturbances of digestion sufficiently, and for the
most part sufficiently early, distinguish the affection.Simple impaction of feces is differentiated by the history of
constipation; by the feel of the hardened feces, which form an
elongated, nodulated, sausage-shaped tumor along the entire ascending
colon, and later in shifting along the transverse colon; by the
comparatively slight tenderness; and by the entire relief which follows
thorough irrigation of the bowel.Cancer may be eliminated by regard of the age of the patient, the slow
development and course of the symptoms, and the gradual manifestation
of its cachexia.Invagination is an affection for the most part of early childhood--is
marked by the sudden appearance of violent symptoms of disturbance of
digestion, vomiting, often stercoraceous, occlusion, diarrhoea, or
dysentery, with straining and discharges of blood.DURATION.--Typhlitis and its complications have no definite duration.A
case may terminate fatally in the course of a few days or may extend
itself over months, or with its effects over years or for life.The
disease is, as a rule, much shorter in childhood than in adult life.According to Matterstock, nearly one-half (44 per cent.)of children
succumb to the disease within the first three days.Wood records the
case of a girl aged ten who died in nine hours.The average duration of
cases of typhlitis without suppuration ranges from fourteen to
twenty-one days.The early evacuation of inflammatory products by
aspiration or incision may cut the disease short at any time, or
exacerbations and remissions may manifest themselves for months or
years--a condition especially liable to occur when burrowing sinuses or
fistulae develop, or when passive encapsulated abscesses are aroused
into activity by some accident or indiscretion on the part of the
patient.PROGNOSIS.--A case of typhlitis stercoralis has no gravity, and should
terminate or be terminated within twenty-four to forty-eight hours
after its recognition.Neglected or unrecognized cases, however, are
not infrequently fatal from the circumscribed or more especially
diffuse peritonitis which may ensue.Typhlitis independent of fecal impaction is always a grave affection,
requiring in every instance a very guarded prognosis.Every form of typhlitis is more fatal in childhood than in adult life,
and any case of the disease may present grave complications or assume a
dangerous form at any time.The greater danger of childhood lies in the
greater liability to peritonitis.Most subsequent writers confirm this
statement, first made by Willard Parker, who also remarked that
suppurative processes, abscess formation, is more common in the adult.The mortality of perityphlitis alone in childhood is 70 per cent., in
adult life 30 per {821} cent., so that the proportion of recoveries is
exactly the reverse of these figures at the different periods of life.The general adoption of the opium treatment has, however, rendered the
prognosis of typhlitis far more favorable--has, in fact, reduced the
mortality in adult life from 80 per cent., the appalling figures of the
older statistics (Volz), to 30 per cent., the ratio of modern times.The means of earlier detection and readier relief of accumulated pus
have also contributed much to reduce the mortality of typhlitis.In
1872, Bull of New York had to report of 67 cases of perityphlitic
abscess collected by him, mostly treated without operation, a mortality
of 47-1/2 per cent., while ten years later (1882) Noyes of Providence
was able to report of 100 cases treated by operation a mortality of
only 15 percent.[Footnote 7: "Contribution to the Clinical Study of Typhlitis, etc.,"
_Trans.The development of fistulae or wandering abscess, the occurrence of
pyaemia and peritonitis, necessarily aggravate the prognosis of a
simple case.Perforation is fatal of necessity, yet cases are not
wanting where recovery has occurred even after this gravest of all the
accidents of the disease.Thus, Patschkrowski reports, from Frerichs'
clinic, a case of recovery after perforation, and Pepper mentions the
results of an autopsy made upon an old man who died of vesical
hemorrhage, in whom he "found that there had, at some unknown previous
time, been perforation of the appendix."PROPHYLAXIS.--The prevention of typhlitis has reference more especially
to cases of habitual recurrence of the disease in adults, or to the
earliest, prodromatous, stage in childhood.The slightest manifestation
of pain in the right iliac region should be looked upon with suspicion
in these cases, and absolute rest enjoined at once.Since in childhood
perforation has occurred in insidious cases after so slight an
irritation as a laxative or an enema, or even after a bath, every
provocation of this kind should be avoided.Injunction is to be put
upon all solid food in all cases in the inception as well as throughout
the course of the affection, that the element of coprostasis be not
superadded to the irritation of the disease.Adults subject to frequent
recurrences or relapses will thus avoid also the development or
aggravation of an intestinal catarrh, which in other cases of trivial
import may become dangerous to them.Many cases of typhlitis are
doubtless aborted at the start by the observance of absolute rest and
abstinence from food or rigid diet at the start.TREATMENT.--Perhaps no disease requires such careful consideration of
its cause or form, inasmuch as the different varieties call for
entirely different treatment.A typhlitis stercoralis, for instance,
requires an exclusive evacuant treatment, whereas a peri- or
paratyphlitis demands a treatment that shall put the bowels at rest.The safest and most effective method of emptying the caecum of impacted
feces is by irrigation of the bowels by means of the funnel syringe
devised by Hegar.The patient is put in the knee, elbow, or chest
posture, and warm water--which is the best solvent for hardened
feces--is allowed to slowly inundate the whole tract of the colon,
after the manner and with the precautions already pointed out in the
article on dysentery.Feeble or reduced patients should be supported in
this posture until as much water as possible is slowly introduced.As a
rule, a single thorough irrigation will suffice, or one or several
additional operations may be required {822} to secure the desired
effect.At the same time, broken doses, twenty grains, of sulphate of
magnesia may be administered every hour or two, not so much for the
purpose of exciting additional peristalsis as of turning water into the
intestinal canal from above.The other varieties of the affection call for opium at the start, with
the double view of preventing the irregular, spasmodic, or tetanic
contraction of the muscular coat and of obviating the danger of
peritonitis.Opium is not contraindicated in these cases, even if the
element of fecal impaction be superadded, as all clinicians are
familiar with the fact that the bowels will move of themselves at times
even under its full narcotic effects.The remedy is best given in fluid form, as in the tincture, that the
dose may be graduated in its repetition to secure its full effect
without danger.When a quick action is required, morphia hypodermically
may be preferred; yet it is to be remembered that opium with all its
active principles is of more value in the relief of peritonitis than
morphia alone.A careful watch should be kept upon all patients treated
with large or frequently-repeated doses of opium, that its toxic
effects be avoided.Not infrequently symptoms of poisoning have
supervened after a sudden relief of pain, necessitating the use of
means to keep the patient awake for a number of hours.Hot embrocations, or poultices applied over large surfaces of the
abdomen, give great comfort to the patient, though the very opposite
treatment of an ice-bag, occasionally shifted or suspended, is more
agreeable in some cases in the inception of the disease.So soon as a distinct doughy sensation or a more marked fluctuation
indicates the development of pus, steps should be undertaken at once to
secure its evacuation.In cases of doubt it is best to make a tentative
exploration with the needle of the aspirator, a large-sized needle
being preferred on account of the liability of occlusion with
tissue-shreds or other debris.It is quite surprising how rapidly a
case clears up at times after the evacuation of even only a drachm or
two of oedematous fluid.More frequently, however, the aspiration must
be repeated until a quantity of pus is secured and the abscess
completely discharged.An abscess of more superficial situation, of larger size, or of
continuous formation is best relieved by free incision.As to the time
of the operation, the old rule, ubi pus ibi incisio, holds good here as
elsewhere.An early evacuation of the products of inflammation prevents
the supreme danger of perforative peritonitis or the formation of
burrowing sinuses, fistulae, amyloid degeneration, and marasmus.Indurated tumors are sometimes made to soften under the long-continued
use of cataplasms, and chronic thickenings of the walls of the
intestine are relieved by general tonics, mild laxatives, mineral
waters, and gentle frictions with iodine or mercurial ointments.Perforative peritonitis calls for opium in maximum doses as a means of
facilitating possible agglutinations or encapsulations, and a forlorn
hope is offered in an early laparotomy, which the bolder surgeons are
now undertaking in the equally desperate cases of perforation by gall-
or kidney-stones, etc.Under no circumstances should a patient affected with typhlitis leave
the bed until the last trace of inflammation has subsided, as in no
disease is there greater liability to recurrence or relapse.{823}

INTESTINAL ULCER.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.Intestinal ulcer, Ulcus intestinorum entero-helcosis ([Greek:
helchosis], ulcer), represents a solution of continuity in the wall of
the intestine, affecting first, as a rule, its mucous coat.Ulcer of
the intestine, like ulcer of the stomach, its occasional congener and
not infrequent associate, is the expression of an insult or injury
offered to the intestinal coat in its inner exposed surface, or of a
necrobiosis the result of a local occlusion in the general
blood-supply.Hence, ulcer of the intestine may be a purely local
disease, or be the local expression of a general, so-called
constitutional, disease.While in many cases the lines differentiating
these conditions may not be distinctly drawn, as many so-called
constitutional conditions (tuberculosis, typhoid fever, etc.)are
discovered to be--at first, at least--local processes, the toxic ulcer
(arsenic, mineral acids) may be taken as a type of the local process,
acting from within, and the syphilitic ulcer as the type of the general
process, acting from without.At the same time, it must be recognized
of syphilis that an ulcer may result from the dissolution or breaking
down of a gummatous mass anywhere in the course of the intestine, or
may be the effect of infection by extension into the rectum of
syphilitic processes about the genital organs, or, lastly, of direct
introduction of the disease in perverted intercourse (pederasty, coitus
heterotopicus).Ulcer of the intestine is occasionally, though comparatively very
rarely, observed also as the result of pressure from within or without.Such an ulcer is properly considered of traumatic or mechanical origin,
as it is induced as the direct effect of mechanical irritation or
arrest of blood-supply.Thus, dense masses of inspissated feces,
foreign bodies, indigestible residue of food, may fret the mucous
surface into a condition of hyperaemia, and, later, absolute
ulceration.Undue retention, as behind a cicatricial contraction, or an
occlusion from whatever cause at places where the intestinal tube
normally offers resistance (at the ileo-caecal valve, sigmoid flexure,
etc.), may lead to ulceration in the same way.Schonlein has called
attention to the paralytic condition of the intestinal muscularis in
age as a predisposing cause of mechanical intestinal ulcer; and Virchow
has noticed the same condition among the insane, whose intense
preoccupation leads to neglect of evacuation of the bowels.Certain
intestinal parasites, more especially ascarides, are admitted as
occasional causes of ulceration, and more superficial solutions of
continuity in the rectum have been noticed as the result of too
frequent or too careless use of enemata.{824} Curling was the first to call attention to the fact that
extensive burns of the skin are sometimes followed by ulceration of the
intestines.The ulcerative process is almost exclusively confined to
the duodenum.Various attempts have been made to explain the intestinal
ulcer consequent upon burning of the skin, but a satisfactory
explanation is lacking as yet.Leube suggests an inhibition in the
force of the circulation by reason of accumulation of waste products in
the blood, while Billroth believes the ulcer to be the result of an
embolic process.Whatever the cause, the frequency of its occurrence
makes it more than a mere coincidence.According to Meyer, it is
observed most frequently in women, and shows its first symptoms in
seven to fourteen days after the initial burn.Aside from toxic and traumatic causes, ulcer of the intestine occurs as
the result of dysentery, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis--diseases
mentioned in the order of frequency in the production of intestinal
ulcer.The ulcers of dysentery in the large intestine, and of typhoid
fever in the small intestine, assume such prominence in these
affections--having even been erroneously considered at one time as the
cause of these maladies--that their study belongs to the history of
these diseases.The ulcer of tuberculosis is rather an accident in the
course of this affection, and is now recognized as the occasional
result of direct infection by the ingestion of tuberculous flesh, or,
far more frequently, of the deglutition of tuberculous sputum.As a
rule, the tuberculous ulcer shows itself late in the course of
pulmonary phthisis, and is the cause of the obstinate and colliquative
diarrhoea which speedily exhausts the patient.Yet cases are
occasionally met in which numerous or extensive ulcers occur in the
intestinal canal early in the history of phthisis, before any serious
damage has been inflicted upon the lungs.The tuberculous ulcer
affects, and for the most part is confined to, the same structures
which form the seat of disease in typhoid fever--viz.the solitary and
agminated glands of the ileum.When the bacilli tuberculosis are
conveyed to the intestine by means of the lymph- and blood-supply
through the mesenteric vessels, the resulting ulcer takes the shape of
the vascular arrangement; that is, the long axis of the ulcer is at
right angles to the course of the tube.Thus, if sufficiently
extensive, the ulcer may be circular or form a girdle or ring entirely
around the tube.With the tubercular ulcer or ulcers are usually found
tubercular nodules or plaques in the serous coat, which are visible to
the naked eye as opacities or milky deposits beneath the peritoneal
coat.The glands of the mesentery may be at the same time so much
increased in size as to form visible or palpable tumors in the abdomen.The frequency with which tuberculosis affects the vermiform appendix
has already been noticed in detail in the etiology of perityphlitis.The ulcer of the intestine which is the result of a catarrhal process,
so called, belongs to the history of chronic diarrhoea and dysentery.The true intestinal ulcer, per se, which has its analogue in the
stomach as the gastric ulcer, ulcus rotundum, is due to the same cause
as in the stomach--viz.to arrest of circulation and erosion by the
gastric juice.It is a well-established fact in physiology that gastric
digestion is continued--is, indeed, mainly effected--in the small
intestine; hence it is not surprising to learn that an arrest of
circulation in the small intestine {825} is attended by the same
result.The fact that this so-called peptic ulcer is found almost
exclusively in the duodenum speaks most emphatically for this origin of
the disease.Arrest of the circulation in the intestinal wall may be
due to embolus, which, according to the observations of Nothnagel and
Parenski, is not infrequently found in the branches of the duodenal
artery; to infarction, the condition so commonly encountered in pyaemia
and septicaemia; or to thrombotic occlusion, as seen in amyloid
degeneration--a disease process which selects by preference the vessels
of the alimentary canal, along with those of the kidney and spleen.The duodenal resembles the gastric ulcer in form as well as origin.It
has the same appearance, in its recent stage at least, of having been
cut out with a punch, shows no inflammation, induration, or thickening
about its borders, and presents the same funnel-shape with terraced
walls, its apex below eccentrically situated, as a rule corresponding
to the situation of the artery.It is most frequently found in the
upper horizontal portion of the duodenum, but is occasionally, though
rarely, seen in the descending portion.In the further course of the
duodenum the gastric juice becomes gradually neutralized, so that
ulcers situated below the orifice of the gall-ducts are very great
exceptions.In Krauss' collection of 47 cases but 2 were found in the
lower sections of the duodenum.The intestinal like the gastric ulcer
is usually found single or alone, but occasionally two, three, or even
four ulcers are encountered.According to the tables of Morot, a single
ulcer is found in 81.8 per cent.of cases, two in 9.2 per cent., and
three and four in 4.5 per cent.Duodenal like gastric ulcers are attended with the liability to
hemorrhage and perforation in equal if not greater degree.There is
also the same tendency to implication of contiguous structures.Stich
records a case of perforation of the aorta; Eichenhorst mentions the
formation of abnormal communication with the gall-bladder; and
Frerichs, a thrombosis of the vena porta in consequence of duodenal
ulcer.Lastly, the process of cicatrization may be followed by the same
disasters as occur in pyloric ulcers in consequence of contraction and
constriction.Thus, the orifices of the pancreatic or choledochus ducts
may be narrowed or completely closed, or the whole lumen of the
duodenum obliterated, with consecutive dilatation of the stomach and
oesophagus, as in the case narrated by Biermer.A very nice question in
differential diagnosis as between pyloric carcinoma and pyloric or
duodenal ulcer is sometimes raised in this way.In the vast majority of
cases it is safe, even in the absence of a palpable tumor and without
regard to the age of the patient, to decide this question in favor of
carcinoma.Cases of complete occlusion constitute the rule in
carcinoma, and the very great exception in ulcer.It remains to be said that duodenal is much more rare than gastric
ulcer, in the ratio of 1 to 30, and that, unlike gastric ulcer, it
chiefly affects males.According to the statistics of Krauss, already
cited, the ratio of males to females is 9 to 1, and according to Trier
the ratio is 5 to 1.Mary moved to the office.It occurs in greatest frequency between the ages
of thirty to forty, diminishing in frequency with advancing age.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Ulcer of the intestines announces itself by symptoms
which are, as a rule, much more vague and indefinite than the same
process in the stomach.In a certain percentage of cases the symptoms
{826} may be entirely latent, and the cause of a sudden death be
revealed only on the post-mortem table.In less severe cases the entire
symptomatology of intestinal ulcer is grouped under the term dyspepsia,
no characteristic phenomena being manifest throughout the course of the
disease.On the other hand, a very small ulcer may give rise to the most
dangerous symptoms--hemorrhage and perforative peritonitis, which may
be even fatal in the course of a few days or hours.Among the symptoms that appear with prominence in the course of the
disease is pain.Although cases are abundantly on record marked by the
entire absence of pain, and although pain is by no means so universally
present as in gastric ulcer, it occurs in the great majority of cases
of ulcer of the intestine.The pain of intestinal ulcer distinguishes
itself from gastric ulcer by being more independent of the character of
the food or the time of taking it.For the most part, it occurs in
attacks of colic, which are characterized at times by their extreme
severity, long duration, and obstinacy to every means of relief.These
attacks occur in paroxysms with complete or only incomplete remissions,
and are ascribed, as in gastric ulcer, to the erosive action of the
gastric juice upon exposed nerve-fibres, the intervals of relief
corresponding to the periods of exhaustion of the nerve-centres.At the
same time, in exceptional cases, a long-continued localized tenderness
to pressure may indicate the seat of the disease.Palpation may elicit, besides tenderness, points or regions of
induration or intumescence.Such a condition is more especially
encountered in cases of tuberculous disease, the so-called scrofula of
the intestine or the tabes mesenterica of childhood.More localized
enlargements are occasionally to be felt in the vicinity of the
duodenal or other intestinal ulcer in consequence of circumscribed
peritonitis, with its resultant agglutinations and adhesions.In this
connection caution must be exercised not to confound masses of impacted
feces with tumefactions.The history of constipation or the
administration of a light laxative will generally suffice to remove
this source of error.Anorexia is a symptom of intestinal ulcer as a rule.The loss of
appetite may amount to a complete aversion to all food or only to the
more fatty articles of diet.A curious exception to this rule is not
infrequently seen in the unappeasable hunger of children the victims of
tuberculous ulceration.The contrast offered in the extreme emaciation
of these patients has been made the subject of frequent comment.With this loss or perversion of appetite and defective digestion of the
food, the general condition soon begins to fail.Though cases are
occasionally met in which a bien-etre has been maintained for years, or
a condition of obesity has been retained, these cases form the
exception in the history of intestinal ulcer.More or less emaciation
gradually develops as a rule, and a reduction of the general strength
that is out of all proportion in its degree to the loss of flesh.At
the same time the mental condition of the patient suffers a degradation
to the level of the sufferer with chronic dyspepsia.The disturbances of digestion which occur in intestinal ulcer present
many varieties in degree and kind.Some patients show none or but few
of the signs, while others run the gamut, so to speak, in the
semeiology of dyspepsia.Heartburn, eructations, pyrosis, borborygmi,
flatulence, gastralgias, pseudo-anginas, nausea, and vomiting, the
familiar {827} phenomena of gastric or intestinal catarrh, attend at
some time or other in the course of the disease most of the cases of
intestinal ulcer.The condition of the discharges demands notice in detail, more
especially as abnormalities in the evacuations belong among the few of
the more constant symptoms of the disease.Diarrhoea is the rule in intestinal ulcer.The discharges consist at
first of the undigested food and the digestive juices, which have been
hurried along the alimentary canal and prematurely evacuated on account
of the increase of peristalsis caused by the irritation in the upper
part of its tract.The arrest of the digestive process leads to early
decomposition of the ingested matters, and thus imparts to the
discharges an exceedingly offensive odor.While, in exceptional cases,
constipation may be present, or even obstipation of the bowels, the
discharges are usually so abundant as to constitute a diarrhoea, which
in some cases is so frequent or profuse as to become colliquative and
speedily exhaust the strength of the patient.An ulceration situated in the colon or rectum would furnish the
discharges characteristic of dysentery, already described in detail,
while the same process in the ileum would show the evacuations
characteristic of typhoid fever or tuberculosis.The most characteristic ingredient of the true duodenal ulcer is blood.As stated in the article on HEMORRHAGE OF THE BOWELS, ulcer of the
intestine constitutes the most frequent source of this accident, which
is sometimes so grave as to destroy life in the course of a few days or
hours.The blood from an intestinal ulcer may be evacuated both by the
mouth and the anus, or may be retained in the alimentary canal and not
appear at all.Such cases constitute the condition known and described
under the heading of occult or concealed hemorrhage, which is
recognized by the rapid general collapse of the patient.When the blood
issues from a duodenal ulcer, it is intimately commingled with the
contents of the alimentary canal.The discharges in such cases are
usually black, tarry, and more or less fluid; whereas blood from the
colon or rectum still preserves its fresh red color and is discharged
separate from the feces or simply coats its exterior.Occasionally
cases are met where the blood coagulates in the interior of the
intestinal canal, to form a cast of its lumen or to accumulate in great
mass in the sigmoid flexure or rectum.In one case in the experience of
the author such an accumulation was the cause of a very severe
tenesmus, which was only relieved by the digital evacuation of large
masses of inspissated, coagulated blood.The presence of pus would indicate lesion of the colon, as typically
shown in dysentery, as suppuration, at least with any visible products,
does not occur in ulcer of the duodenum.DURATION.--Ulcer of the intestine has no definite duration.As in the
case of its prototype, gastric ulcer, it may speedily be covered with
cicatricial tissue and never appear again in the course of a long life.But such a course is as unusual as in gastric ulcer.Frequent
recurrence constitutes the rule in intestinal ulcer, or a partial
recovery with frequent relapses, as in the course of ulcer of the
stomach.So ulcer of the intestine is not infrequently a lifetime
malady, with exacerbations and remissions dependent largely upon the
prudence or imprudence of the patient with regard to diet.It need
hardly be stated that ulcer of the intestine {828} may terminate
fatally even in the course of a few days from hemorrhage, circumscribed
and later diffuse peritonitis, or may drag out a slow length of years,
to finally destroy the patient with the general symptoms of inanition,
hydrops, and marasmus.DIAGNOSIS.--From what has been already stated, it is seen that ulcer of
the intestine is often entirely overlooked or may be readily confounded
with other maladies of the digestive tract.Cases of traumatic or toxic
origin are generally readily recognized by the history of the patient,
and tuberculosis reveals itself by the youth of the individual, the
existence of the disease elsewhere, the gradual emaciation, the
premature senescence--in short, the general signs of the phthisical
habitus, the meteorism, and perhaps the presence of nodular
enlargements of the mesenteric glands.The most characteristic symptom of the peptic ulcer is, as has been
stated, hemorrhage.But hemorrhage is present in only the minority of
cases, is, as a rule, occasional and transitory, and is at all times
difficult of differentiation as to its source.Blood from a gastric
ulcer may also be voided per rectum as well as per os, and the blood
from a duodenal ulcer after regurgitation may be wholly discharged by
vomiting.The absence of vomiting and the presence--more especially the
persistence--of tarry evacuations from the bowels would speak for ulcer
of the intestine.Dilatation of the duodenum, a condition of ectasia,
closure of the bile-duct with consecutive jaundice, or the presence of
fatty stools from occlusion of the pancreatic duct (a sign not now
regarded of the same value as in the days of Bright), would also
declare in favor of ulcer in the duodenum.As between intestinal ulcer and catarrh or intestinal ulcer and
carcinoma, precisely the same rules would hold as in the case of the
stomach.A simple enteralgia would be recognized by its more frequent
occurrence among females or individuals of neurotic temperament; by its
connection with faults of diet, malaria, or exposure to cold; by the
absence of hemorrhage, diarrhoea, or peritonitis.PROGNOSIS.--Too much caution cannot be exercised in the prognosis of
ulcer of the intestine; for even in the cases which run a perfectly
mild course the gravest, even fatal, accidents are liable to occur.The
danger of perforation in cases of typhoid fever from a single or from
one of the few ulcers that may be present imparts one of the chief
elements of gravity to this disease; and the same catastrophe may occur
at any time in dysentery or tuberculosis.The duodenal ulcer may
likewise have a sudden gravity imparted to a mild case by a copious
hemorrhage or a peritonitis, and, even though the patient escape all
possible complications, to recover with the surface of the ulcer healed
so that the loss of substance is filled in with firm cicatricial
tissue, the danger of contraction or stenosis still remains.The ulcers
of dysentery in the colon and of syphilis in the rectum are especially
liable to be followed by deformities of this kind, while the
tuberculous ulcer in the ileum not infrequently results in a more or
less complete stenosis.The ulcer of typhoid fever in its cicatrization
almost never reduces the size of the intestinal canal.TREATMENT.--The most valuable therapeutic means of relieving the pain
and obviating the dangers of ulcer of the intestine consist in the
{829} regulation of the diet.The food should be light, easily
digestible, and during the acute stage of the disease as nearly fluid
in its consistency as may be.Milk would be the staple article of diet
in all cases were it not for the fact that in some cases constipation
attends its too exclusive use.The various soups, without solids,
broths, preparations of starch (sago, arrowroot, tapioca, etc.), may
sufficiently nourish the patient until the healing process shall have
commenced.Raw beef, chopped up and made into an emulsion, is perhaps
the most nutritious and least injurious of any kind of food.Bread,
potatoes and other vegetables should be ruled out altogether, because
of their liability to produce masses of feces whose inspissation may do
mechanical damage to ulcers in process of cicatrization.Where there is failure in the general strength early resort should be
had to alcohol, which may be administered in the form of red wine (in
preference to white, because of the tannin it contains), wine-whey, or,
in more serious prostration, of sherry wine, milk punch, egg-nog made
with good whiskey or brandy.In the worst cases, where all food irritates, feeding by the mouth may
be abandoned altogether for a time, and the strength of the patient
sustained by nutritive enemata of beef or pancreatic emulsion.The diarrhoea should be controlled rather than entirely checked, for
fear of the greater evil of constipation.A little bismuth with
bicarbonate of sodium or oxide of zinc may suffice for the milder
cases, while in the more aggravated cases resort must be had sooner or
later to opium.Constipation is best relieved by careful injections of warm water or by
the administration of the lighter laxatives--mineral waters, Seidlitz
powders, citrate of magnesia, castor oil, etc.Vomiting is combated by ice, soda-water, champagne, cherry-laurel
water, and in graver cases morphia hypodermically.Pain may be relieved by applications of hot water, cataplasms,
injections of hot water, and, when necessary, by morphia with or
without belladonna.Hemorrhage is checked by ice internally and externally, turpentine,
ergot or preferably ergotin by hypodermic injection, and opium.Peritonitis, more especially perforative peritonitis, calls
imperatively for the liberal use of opium.Patients the victims of intestinal ulcer must maintain a guarded diet
for months, often for years, after all signs of the disease have
disappeared as the best prophylaxis against recurrence.Constant
vigilance is also required to avoid constipation, and the greatest
temperance exercised with regard to the use of alcohol.The author has
at the present time a patient under treatment who presents all the
symptoms of duodenal ulcer, including hemorrhage, with every indulgence
in strong drink, and in whom all symptoms disappear under entire
abstention.Sometimes a course of mineral waters, a sea-voyage, or
other change of life or scene constitutes the best means of avoiding
frequent relapse.It need hardly be said that an ulcer in the rectum, which is readily
recognized by its attending tenesmus, calls for local treatment; and it
is equally plain that tuberculosis or syphilis requires appropriate
internal means of relief.{830}

HEMORRHAGE OF THE BOWELS.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.GENERAL REMARKS.--Hemorrhage of the bowels occurs in both sexes, though
more frequently in the male, and at all ages, though more frequently at
the middle period of life.In the infant a form of it is sometimes
considered as a distinct affection under the head of melaena
neonatorum, and in age it sometimes shows itself as a distinct sign of
a disease characteristic of age--namely, cancer.According to the
tables of Bamberger, it is caused in the order of frequency by
dysentery, typhus fever, cancer (of the colon), mechanical injury,
poisons and foreign bodies, ulceration (tubercular, follicular), the
round ulcer of the duodenum, and aneurism; last and least frequent is
the so-called vicarious hemorrhage.ETIOLOGY.--Hemorrhage from the intestinal canal arises from (1)
anomalies in the contents of the bowel; (2) disease of the wall of the
bowel; and (3) from general diseases.(1) The inspissation of the natural contents of the bowel during
long-standing or habitual constipation may convert the feces into dense
masses which irritate and scratch the mucous membrane, and thus induce
hemorrhage directly by simple solution of continuity, or indirectly as
the result of extreme hyperaemia.Such hemorrhage is nearly always
slight, streaking or coating the surface of the scybalous mass or being
extruded from the anus as a small deposit of blood during the last act
of defecation; in which latter case it is found mostly associated with
hemorrhoids or fissure of the anus--conditions which require separate
description.Independent of these conditions, the hemorrhage nearly
always has its origin in the lowest regions of the large intestine,
where condensation of the feces is naturally greatest.Foreign bodies in the intestinal canal descended from the stomach may
also be the cause of hemorrhage in the same way.Thus, stones of
fruits, bones of fish, fragments of oyster-shell, or other substances
in no way connected with aliments (false teeth, buttons, pins and
needles, etc.), may be swallowed accidentally or purposely (as by
children or the insane) to produce intestinal hemorrhage.Drastic
cathartics (podophyllin, gamboge, etc.)and poisons (arsenic, mineral
acids) occasionally act in the same way.Thus, Tardieu reports[1] the
case of a servant to whom was administered by a homoeopath veratrin
with coffee, with fatal effect in six days.At the autopsy, made by
Amussat and Reymond, the stomach and small {831} intestine were found
filled with a dark-brown or black bloody fluid, but there was no trace
of perforation, ulceration, or organic disease.[Footnote 1: _Annales d'Hygiene_, July, 1854.]Under this head mention should be made also of certain parasites whose
habitat is the intestinal canal, the walls of which they perforate.Two
varieties, the Anchylostoma duodenale and the Distoma hepaticum, are
frequent causes of hemorrhage, the former from the duodenum and
jejunum, the latter from the rectum, in hot climates, more especially
in India and Egypt.(2) Anomalies in the intestinal walls produce hemorrhage as the result
of intense hyperaemia (per diapedesin) or of actual loss of substance
(per rhexin).Copious, even fatal, hemorrhage has thus ensued from
dysenteric and typhoid processes (and even without discoverable cause)
where no ulceration or loss of substance could be discovered on
autopsy; and this accident is so frequent as the result of ulceration
in the diseases mentioned as to constitute a characteristic sign or
complication.It must be said, however, that cases of alarming or fatal
hemorrhage without apparent cause during life or lesion after death
were more frequently reported in the literature of the times preceding
our more accurate knowledge of pathology and pathogeny.Few clinicians
or pathologists would now be content with reports made without full
knowledge of the history of the case or microscopic examination of the
intestinal walls.Thus, the report to the Societe Medicale d'Emulation,
April 2, 1834, by Dubois of a young man who quickly died of intestinal
hemorrhage five days after a severe headache, and on the same occasion
by Guillemot of several similar cases, would awaken the suspicion of
masked typhoid fever; and the case of an old man aged seventy-four who
died of intestinal hemorrhage after four days' diarrhoea, reported by
Husson,[2] would call for a close examination of the vessels in the
intestinal walls.In fact, Bricheteau, who reported a case from the
Hopital Neckar, was able on autopsy to discover a rupture in a small
artery of the intestines.[Footnote 2: _Proceedings of the Anatomical Society at Paris_, 1835.]Embolic processes leading to the formation of ulceration (by
predilection in the duodenum) are often attended with intestinal
hemorrhage, which would be more constantly present were it not for the
fact that, as in the stomach, the speedy establishment of collateral
circulation prevents the consequences of complete infarction.Besides dysentery and typhoid fever, tuberculosis and syphilis are
occasional causes of ulceration and necrosis of the intestinal walls
which may be attended with hemorrhage.Cancer of the intestine most
frequently affects the rectum, but wherever situated may show
hemorrhage as one of its signs.The local hyperplasia of the mucous tissue which constitutes a
polypus--and which in children, in whom it most frequently occurs, is
mostly situated in the rectum--is suspected to exist or is recognized
by the frequent discharge of blood from the bowels.A far more grave
affection of the intestinal walls, likewise most frequent in childhood,
is the peculiar dislocation known as intussusception or invagination.This condition is so commonly attended with distressing evacuations of
blood and mucus as to simulate dysentery.The strangulation of the
intussuscepted mesentery with its vessels easily accounts for the
hemorrhage in such cases.A more extensive compression is exercised at times by tumors in the
{832} abdominal cavity, as by pregnancy, ovarian growths, etc.,
occlusions in the course of the portal system (cirrhosis hepatis),
interference with the general circulation, as in diseases of the heart
or lungs, with intestinal hemorrhage as a consequence.Diseases of the blood-vessels themselves, as amyloid degeneration,
aneurism, should not be omitted from the list of factors possibly
productive of this result.(3) The general diseases attended with hemorrhage from the bowel are
characterized for the most part by more or less general disintegration
or dissolution of the blood, with the manifestation of hemorrhage in
various parts of the body--kidneys, uterus, subcutaneous tissue, etc.;
the enterorrhagia being an accidental localization, so to speak, of the
effusion.The most prolific causes of this disorganization are the
micro-organisms which "touch the life of the blood corruptibly;" and
hence the various acute infectious diseases may show in the severer
forms hemorrhage from the bowels.Under this head may be ranged
variola, which boasts even of a hemorrhagic form; typhus, yellow, and
malarial fevers; the forms of nephritis marked by uraemia, cholera,
icterus gravis, erysipelas, etc.Disintegration of the blood or partial
dissolution of its corpuscular elements occurs also in those obscure
affections which constitute the group, or are included in the
description, of the hemorrhagic diatheses, as haemophilia, leuchaemia,
pernicious anaemia, scurvy; of any of which enterorrhagia may be a
distinct or dangerous sign.Melaena neonatorum is the distinct name given to a hemorrhage from the
bowels which occurs a few hours or days after birth, and which is often
so profuse as to cause death at once or in a short time.In most cases
no anatomical lesions can be discovered after death, save an intense
hyperaemia of the intestinal mucosa, so that the etiology of this
affection is involved in obscurity.The various causes assigned in its
production--ulceration of the stomach or duodenum (Bohn), embolism
(Landau), fatty degeneration (Steiner), premature ligature of the
umbilical cord (Kiwisch)--answer only for individual cases.Betz
reported a case in a family subject to haemophilia, and Trousseau once
saw twins thus affected; but that heredity cannot account for all cases
is shown by the fact that it occurs mostly in healthy children from
healthy parentage.Klebs is inclined to attribute the affection to the
action of micro-organisms, introduced perhaps as the result of
puerperal infection, but this cause can be assumed in only a small
minority of cases; at least, but a small percentage of cases coincide
with puerperal disease on the part of the mother.Eichhorst states that Hecker
observed it but once in 500 births, and Gemich but once in 1000 births.According to Rilliet, the hemorrhage is oftener (8/14) intestinal,
rarer (4/14) gastric, and rarest (2/14) both.It is almost always
abundant and quickly repeated, the blood being mostly pure, in clots or
masses and fluid, though it is sometimes commingled with meconium.It
usually ceases within twenty-four hours, though it may continue for
three, five, or more days.Of 23 cases reported by this author, 12
recovered and 11 died.MORBID ANATOMY.--Hemorrhage from the bowels, being only a symptom of
very many different conditions, is marked by lesions characteristic of
the condition in an individual case.These lesions are more
appropriately described in connection with the various diseases.Not
{833} infrequently in these cases the intestine is distinguished by the
absence of any lesion at all; but, from whatever cause, hemorrhage from
the bowels, like hemorrhage from any other source, shows a more or less
profound anaemia of all the internal organs, and in more chronic and
protracted cases leads to fatty degeneration, more especially of the
heart.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Hemorrhage from the bowels is usually readily
recognized by the discharge of blood, either pure or mixed with the
natural contents of the alimentary canal.The actual seat of the
hemorrhage may, however, only rarely be recognized by the rectal
speculum.The colicky pains, borborygmi, or sensations of fluids in the
abdomen which are occasionally experienced may not be relied upon in
fixing the seat of the effusion.Should the hemorrhage occur in
quantity, or, more especially, should the seat of the effusion be low
in the intestinal canal, the blood which escapes is more or less pure.When the hemorrhage is higher, or when the stay of the blood in the
bowel is longer, it becomes more or less incorporated with the contents
of the bowels or altered by the intestinal juices to present a
discharge of mushy or semi-fluid consistence, of dark-brown or black
color.So-called tarry stools are thus largely composed of blood.But serious, even fatal, hemorrhage sometimes occurs without the escape
of any blood at all.Such are the so-called cases of concealed, occult,
or internal hemorrhage, in which the nature of the malady is only
suspected or recognized by the general symptoms attending the profuse
loss of blood.Should the hemorrhage be gradual, anaemia slowly
supervenes, with hydraemia and subcutaneous dropsy.Traube reports a
fatal case of oedema of the glottis from such a cause.Sudden
hemorrhage announces itself by pallor and prostration, dyspnoea,
vertigo, and syncope.Amaurosis, tinnitus aurium, formication, emesis,
and, if the disease be high up in the intestinal canal, haematemesis,
are the common attendants of serious hemorrhage.In the worst cases of
sudden effusion the patient may present the appearance of complete
collapse, and the intestinal canal be found on autopsy distended with
blood throughout a great part of its course, while no blood whatever
has escaped from the rectum.In such cases, or with more gradual loss
of blood, the patient experiences a sense of increasing weakness, the
skin becomes cold and bedewed with a clammy sweat, the pulse grows
feebler, the temperature falls, and death from exhaustion more or less
speedily ensues.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of blood in any quantity in the stools is
readily recognized by its coarser characteristics.Ridiculous errors
have been made by mistaking the coloration produced by bismuth, iron,
logwood, etc.administered internally, or by coloring matters
introduced into the discharges for purposes of deception.The
microscope, Zeichmann's test for blood-crystals, and in extremely
doubtful or medico-legal cases the spectroscope, furnish easy means of
detecting blood in whatever quantity or character.It is the cause and seat, rather than the existence, of the hemorrhage
that mostly cause embarrassment in differential diagnosis.Hemorrhage
from the lungs, nose, or stomach is usually readily excluded by the
absence of any evidence of disease of these organs, and the presence of
the other symptoms of any general disease attended with enterorrhagia
makes a diagnosis in most cases easy enough.Alterations in the
contents of the {834} bowel, the presence of foreign bodies, are
recognized by the history of the case and by careful local examination,
while a diagnosis of anomalies in the walls of the bowel is usually
reached by exclusion.In no doubtful case should local inspection or
digital examination of the anus and rectum be omitted.TREATMENT.--As in all cases of hemorrhage, the first requisite is
absolute rest.The patient should be at once put to bed and kept
perfectly quiet.Many a case of hemorrhage in typhoid fever is produced
by arising from bed to go to stool.The bed-pan is an absolute
necessity in the management of a case of typhoid fever after the second
week of the disease.Rest is the chief agent in prophylaxis as well as
therapy.The most effective styptic in enterorrhagia is cold.An ice-bladder
should be laid upon or suspended immediately above the abdomen during
the whole duration of the flow.The injection of ice-water into the
bowel should be practised only in cases where the hemorrhage is
believed to come from the colon.Otherwise, the peristalsis it awakens
may only aggravate the danger.Should rest and cold fail to quickly
check the hemorrhage, resort should be had at once to ergot.This
remedy, in the form of ergotin, is most effective when introduced
beneath the skin.In cases of less imminent danger the practitioner may
be content to give the remedy by the mouth.Small doses of the simple or camphorated tincture of opium frequently
repeated speedily arrest contractions of the bowel, and at the same
time feed the brain in threatening syncope.The astringents
proper--tannic acid or its preparations, acetate of lead, alum, the
perchloride of iron--are seldom necessary or advisable, but may be
called for in obstinate or protracted cases.To turpentine has been ascribed, from time immemorial, specific virtues
in relief of hemorrhage of the bowels, and its administration is still
a routine system with many older practitioners.It is most effective in
large doses--one drachm, with milk or in emulsion, every hour or two
until the hemorrhage ceases.In relief of collapse, alcohol, ether, and musk are imperatively
indicated, with the external application of heat; and in the treatment
of the anaemia and hydraemia the preparations of iron, including,
later, the mineral waters which contain it.In the worst cases of
sudden alarming hemorrhage the physician should not fail to practise
the transfusion of blood or solutions of salt or soda.Milk is the best food and drink during the attack, and after it for
some days or weeks.Chopped or scraped raw beef may substitute it
later, while all farinaceous foods are to be strictly avoided for some
time.{835}

INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION.BY HUNTER MCGUIRE, M.D.When a mechanical impediment to the passage of the contents of the
bowel along the intestinal canal exists, the condition is known as
intestinal obstruction.The causes of this occurrence are numerous, the
symptoms urgent, the diagnosis difficult, the treatment uncertain, and
the termination, unless relieved by nature or art, speedily fatal.There is no class of cases to which the practitioner is called more
important, or which demands on his part greater skill and judgment.It is customary to divide the causes of obstruction of the bowels into
two great classes--acute and chronic.In acute cases the attack is sudden, the symptoms violent, and, unless
the cause is speedily removed, life ends in a few hours or at most in a
few days.In chronic cases the causes act comparatively more slowly,
the symptoms are chronic and less urgent, and danger of death less
imminent.In this class the cause is not uncommonly spontaneously
relieved, and the individual restored to perfect health without the aid
of medicine or the surgeon's art.This result may happen in apparently
the most desperate cases.This classification of acute and chronic obstruction is necessary for a
proper clinical study of the subject, but it should be remembered that
in practice there will be found some cases which partake of many of the
symptoms of both acute and chronic obstruction, making it difficult to
determine to which division the cases properly belong.It will also be
seen that some, at first, well-marked acute cases subside and become
chronic in character, and that (old) chronic cases of obstruction
sometimes suddenly change their nature and become acute.Again, some of
the causes mentioned as giving rise to acute obstruction of the bowel
in rare instances produce symptoms of chronic obstruction, and some of
the causes referred to as giving rise to symptoms of chronic
obstruction in rare instances provoke signs of acute obstruction.As a rule, the following list embraces
conditions which produce symptoms of acute obstruction:

1.Impaction of foreign bodies, gall-stones, enteroliths, etc.Twisting of the bowel--volvulus.Internal strangulation by loops, bands, false membranes,
diverticula, mesenteric pouches, slipping of a portion of bowel into
natural or unnatural openings, diaphragmatic hernia, etc.As a rule, the following causes produce symptoms of chronic intestinal
obstruction:

1.Stricture of the bowel, sometimes cancerous.Contraction of the bowel from inflammatory changes, often
tuberculous.A consideration of external hernia is, of course, not included in this
paper, but the possibility of the symptoms of intestinal obstruction
being due to this cause should never be overlooked.Congenital Strictures and Malformations.Cases of congenital strictures and malformations are confined almost
wholly to the rectum and anus, and come more properly under the
province of the surgeon.Some of the cases, however, belong to the
physician, the obstruction being so slight as not to require surgical
assistance.With all of them, however, the physician should be
familiar, that he may be able to distinguish between congenital
malformation giving rise to immediate obstruction and other forms of
intestinal occlusion.He should know, too, when to seek the aid of the
surgeon.For these reasons, as well as to make the history of the
causes of intestinal obstruction as complete as possible, it has been
thought proper to include in the list congenital occlusion and
malformation of the intestine.They will be treated, however, in the
briefest possible way, and the reader is referred to works on surgery
for a more detailed account of the pathology, symptoms, and treatment.When congenital occlusion of the colon occurs, it is almost invariably
found in the sigmoid flexure, and is due, as most congenital atresia of
the intestine, to foetal peritonitis.Congenital occlusion may be found
in any portion of the small bowel, but a frequent site is the lower
part of the ileum and the ileo-caecal opening.The following case[1]
gives an example of a form of stricture of the duodenum in infants,
with the symptoms and pathological changes.The septum is supposed to
be an unnaturally developed valve, or two valvulae conniventes united:
"A child when born presented no unusual symptoms for the first
twenty-four hours.Vomiting then came on, and continued with short
intermissions until death, which took place some thirty-eight hours
after birth.The only
disease found was stricture of the duodenum close to the entrance of
the gall-duct, so that a probe passed down the latter entered the
duodenum immediately below the constriction.There was nothing to
indicate in what manner the constriction had occurred.On the gastric
side of the latter the duodenum was immensely distended--so much so
that at first sight it appeared like the pyloric end of the stomach
itself, and only by a more careful examination was the distinction
between the stomach and intestine detected by a ridge running around
their place of junction."Pollock in Holmes's _System of Surgery_,
from _Pathological Transactions_, vol.{837} Cases like this, a number of which are on record, are instructive
and of pathological interest; when, however, congenital occlusion
exists in the small intestines, no treatment can be suggested.If the
sigmoid flexure is the part involved and diagnosis can be made, opening
the intestine in the right groin and establishing an artificial anus
should be attempted.In the development of the foetus the anal part of the bowel, beginning
below, develops upward, and the intestinal portion, commencing above,
grows downward; both portions, advancing, finally unite, making one
continuous tube.When, however, there is some interruption in the
foetal development of the intestine, and the two portions of bowel fail
to unite, we have malformation of the rectum and anus and intestinal
obstruction; or the two portions of bowel may have been united and
continuity of the intestinal track established, and subsequent
intra-uterine inflammation may obliterate the canal.Under these
circumstances a ligamentous cord represents the original tube.The cord
descends from the cul-de-sac in which the upper part of the bowel ends
to the skin about the anus, or is lost in the tissues about the neck of
the bladder.In congenital malformations the following conditions may
be found: 1st.The anal orifice may be so minute as not to allow the
feces to escape; or the aperture may be occluded by a membrane, through
which the meconium may be seen; or the anus may be entirely absent.The rectum may be occluded by a membranous septum, the presence of
which is not suspected until symptoms of intestinal obstruction arise,
and then it is discovered by introducing the finger or a probe; or the
rectum may be entirely absent, the colon terminating in the iliac fossa
in a dilated pouch, or ending at the top of the sacrum or stopping at
any point between this and the normal anus, the place being determined
by the period of arrest of foetal development; or, the anus being
absent, the rectum may open into the vagina, bladder, urethra, and
other places.Intestinal obstruction may arise from the introduction, accidental or
otherwise, of foreign bodies into the stomach and bowels.Coins,
marbles, bullets, fruit-seeds, etc.are often swallowed by children,
sometimes intentionally, and if the object is round and small it rarely
gives rise to any serious trouble.The foreign body, however, if small,
may drop into the appendix vermiformis or some other diverticulum and
end in serious mischief, or if the individual has stricture of the
bowel the foreign body may be arrested by it.Foreign bodies which are pointed or irregular in shape, swallowed by
accident or design, may give rise to dangerous and fatal symptoms, but
not unfrequently they escape per vias naturales.Thus, pins, needles,
pieces of bone, artificial plate and teeth, small pen-knives, and other
pointed or irregular-shaped bodies, have passed in this way.Sharp-pointed bodies, as needles, sometimes make their way through the
walls of the stomach and present themselves at other and more distant
parts of the body.I have removed a needle from the calf of the leg
which {838} the patient had a month before accidentally swallowed.Jugglers accidentally, in practising their calling, and insane people,
not unfrequently intentionally, introduce into the stomach all sorts of
foreign bodies, such as buckles, forks, spoons, knives, pieces of wood,
iron, bone, etc.Gross[2] records the case of a juggler who let a bar
of lead ten inches long and weighing a pound slip into his stomach.Bell of Iowa removed it by gastrotomy, and the man recovered.Agnew[3]
reports a post-mortem of an insane woman in whose intestinal canal he
found three spools of cotton, two roller bandages, a number of skeins
of thread, and a pair of suspenders.[Footnote 2: _System of Surgery_, by S. D. Gross, 6th ed., vol.[Footnote 3: _Agnew's Surgery_, vol.The morbid appetite of some people, particularly girls and pregnant
women, sometimes induces them to swallow powdered chalk, magnesia, and
other substances, and when this practice is continued for a long time
the insoluble powder is deposited in the bowel and forms hard masses
which more or less completely obstruct the intestines.Stony concretions or enteroliths are found generally in the caecum or
in the sacculi of the colon, very rarely in the small intestines.They
are round or oval, and when two or more are found together they have
facets.They consist usually of carbonate of lime or magnesia or
sesquioxide of iron.Other concretions are sometimes seen composed of
starch or the felted husks of oats, called oat-stones (avenoliths),
found particularly among the poorer classes of people in Scotland.Other vegetable remains of husks, fibres, etc.Young and middle-aged people more frequently suffer with these
concretions than the old.Foreign bodies made up by the gradual
accumulation of hair, string, and other substances are not unfrequently
found in the stomach and intestines.The mass produced in this way is
often very large.Sometimes the foreign body is arrested in the
oesophagus.In a post-mortem reported to the writer by Fairfax a large
copper coin, accidentally swallowed a few days before, was found lodged
in the gullet.Ulceration followed, a neighboring artery was opened,
and the patient died from hemorrhage.Impaction of the bowel by gall-stones escaping from the gall-bladder
into the bowel is by no means an unfrequent cause of fatal obstruction.Small gall-stones, after giving rise to intense pain and often grave
symptoms during their passage through the bile-ducts, may escape into
the duodenum and be discharged through the rectum, as any other small
foreign body.If, however, there is constriction or stricture of the
bowel at any point, the small gall-stone may lodge there, and if other
stones follow and lodge, the collection may soon be great enough to
produce obstruction.A very large single stone or a number of stones
forming a coherent mass may collect in the gall-bladder, slowly distend
the dilatable biliary passages, and escape into the bowel; or--and this
is more common--an opening made by ulceration between the distended
gall-bladder and the duodenum allows the concretion to escape into the
small intestine.These stones or aggregation of stones are sometimes
three, four, or five inches in circumference and from one to four
inches long.They occur, as a rule, in people over fifty years of age,
and more commonly in women.Brinton, in his excellent book on
_Intestinal Obstruction_, makes the average age in these cases
fifty-three and a half {839} years, and from the statistics he has
gathered it will be seen that their occurrence is four times as often
in females as in males.In 41 cases collected by Leichtenstern, 32 were
women and 9 men.The site of the impaction is always in the small
intestines.In 32 cases observed by Leichtenstern, 17 were found in the
lower part of the ileum, 10 occupied the duodenum and jejunum, and 5
the middle part of the ileum.SYMPTOMS.--Foreign substances introduced into the stomach do not always
immediately give rise to serious symptoms.It is wonderful sometimes to
see how tolerant the stomach is of their presence.Many instances are
recorded of foreign bodies remaining in the stomach for months without
producing dangerous symptoms.The mass may be discharged by vomiting,
or it may escape through the pyloric opening into the intestine, and
ultimately be discharged through the rectum, or, lodging in the bowel,
give rise to symptoms of inflammation and obstruction.If, however, the
foreign mass remains in the stomach, and is not removed by the
surgeon's art or spontaneously discharged by ulceration, as in several
rare instances has been the case, it uniformly proves fatal.Before the foreign body is discharged by ulceration through the walls
of the abdomen, adhesive inflammation unites that portion of the
alimentary canal, gastric or intestinal, in which the mass is lodged
with some part of the abdominal wall.By this union the cavity of the
peritoneum is protected, just as we see the peritoneal sac protected by
an effusion of lymph in hepatic abscess opening into the small
intestine.If the adhesion between the canal and abdominal wall is
imperfect, or by an undue amount of inflammation is disunited, the
foreign body or inflammatory products which surround it may escape into
the peritoneal sac and produce fatal peritonitis.Instead of passing
through the abdominal wall, the foreign substance may escape into the
bladder or vagina, or from the small intestine into the colon or
rectum.Dangerous peritonitis may follow the simple presence of the
foreign body in the alimentary canal from the obstruction it produces
when no attempt at discharge by ulceration has been made.If the size
and shape of the body permit its passage into the small intestine, it
makes its way very slowly along this tube, giving rise to occasional
attacks of colicky pains and symptoms of partial impermeability of the
bowel.At any moment the foreign body may lodge, become impacted in the canal,
and all the grave symptoms of enteritis and general peritonitis present
themselves.Symptoms of inflammation may appear, and after a longer or
shorter time suddenly disappear, as if the foreign body had glided over
some point of obstruction and again begun its descent through the tube.Its course is always irregular, passing quite rapidly over a portion of
the intestine, then going more slowly, then lodging for a time at some
point where it is obstructed by a fold or the contents of the bowel or
by spasmodic contraction of the muscular coat of the intestines.As the
calibre of the small intestine gradually diminishes as it approaches
the caecum, the passage of the foreign body becomes more and more
difficult as it is propelled onward toward the ileo-caecal valve.After
a time it may reach the caecum, where, of all places, it is most apt to
lodge; but it may continue its course to the rectum, where it gives
rise to tenesmus and a constant desire to go to stool.Finally,
spontaneously or aided by the finger of the physician or some
instrument, it is {840} evacuated per anum.Not unfrequently, the
foreign body can be felt through the abdominal walls, and its course
traced day after day as it makes its way along the canal.It is a common practice with uninformed persons to give castor oil or
some purgative medicine when a pin, needle, coin, or other foreign
substance has accidentally passed from the mouth into the stomach.Experience has shown that the
larger and more solid the alvine discharges, the more likely the
foreign body is to escape by the natural outlet; and the physician
should order such a regimen and diet as will probably secure this
condition of the contents of the bowel.Long residence of a foreign mass at any point in the intestinal canal
is certain to produce some chronic enteritis and effusion of lymph and
subsequent stricture of the bowel, or the presence of the foreign body
may produce an ulcer; and when this is healed the resulting cicatrix
may end in serious obstruction from the natural tendency of the new
material to contract.Signs of constriction of the bowel may not be
noticed for some time after the escape of the foreign body.Obstruction from the presence of intestinal stones and concretions is
almost invariably preceded by impaired health, emaciation, or cachectic
appearance, signs of partial impermeability of the bowels, and repeated
attacks of inflammation, especially in the region of the caecum.It
terminates sometimes by the concretion becoming encysted, by its
spontaneous evacuation, or by ulceration and perforation, or sometimes
by complete occlusion of the bowel, and death.As occlusion of the bowel by the presence of gall-stones always occurs
in the small intestines, the symptoms are at once of the most urgent
and violent character.The signs are those of internal strangulation,
and the termination is often rapid in the extreme.Colicky, griping
pains are soon succeeded by violent agony; vomiting begins at once, and
is constant; at first bile is thrown up, and afterward feculent matter;
the pulse is small, wiry, and frequent; the belly is retracted; the
features are pinched, the extremities cold, and prostration soon comes
on, succeeded by collapse.Evidences of disorder of the liver, symptoms of inflammation of the
peritoneum in that region, or attacks of hepatic colic sometimes
precede obstruction of the bowel by gall-stones; unfortunately,
however, for the purposes of diagnosis, these premonitory symptoms are
not invariably present.Acute Internal Strangulation, Twisting, etc.When a portion of bowel within the abdomen is constricted, its
circulation interfered with, and the passage of the contents of the
bowel interrupted, it gives rise to acute internal strangulation.This
condition is very similar to that of external strangulated hernia.The
difference is, that one is inside and the other outside of the cavity
of the abdomen.Twisting of the gut upon its mesenteric axis, the passage of the bowel
through some natural or unnatural opening, the encircling of one
portion of bowel by another or by bands, false membranes, etc., may
cause {841} internal strangulation.It may happen at any age, and
involves generally the small intestine or the more movable parts of the
large bowel--viz.the sigmoid flexure and caecum.Twisting, or torsion, is not an unfrequent cause of intestinal
obstruction, and may involve almost any portion of the intestinal tube.Its most common site is the sigmoid flexure, and next in point of
frequency the caecum.It sometimes, but rarely, involves the small
intestines, and may occur as a simple twisting of one loop of
intestines upon another.First, the mesentery must be elongated.This change in the
mesenteric root may have been caused by the dragging of an old and
large hernia, or the mesentery may have been lengthened by relaxation
of the abdominal walls from childbearing or by the disappearance of
fat.However caused, before torsion of the gut takes place the
mesentery is elongated, so that the two ends are approximated and
something like a pedicle formed.Second, the portion of bowel attached
to the lengthened mesentery may become filled with an enormous quantity
of fecal matter and paralyzed by the great distension.In this paretic
condition it may be displaced by the living, moving parts around it,
and become bent and twisted, or the length of bowel belonging to the
elongated portion of the mesentery may be the seat of inflammation,
and, paralysis following, it becomes without resistance subject to the
pressure and movements of the active vital parts surrounding it.A
portion of bowel with its accumulated contents having a redundant
mesentery and paralyzed by enormous distension or by inflammation, or
by both, may readily be twisted more or less completely, and in some
cases several times upon itself.The weight of the bowel and its contents, along with the rapid
distension of the intestine above, fixes the gut in this state of
torsion and effectually prevents it from untwisting.A semi-rotation of
the paretic and distended bowel about the mesenteric axis is sufficient
to interfere with the supply and return of blood and provoke enteritis.Indeed, the rotation is rarely sufficiently great to produce complete
obstruction, and the symptoms are frequently rather those of
inflammation than of internal strangulation.For weeks before the final
attack the patient usually has symptoms of intestinal disorder, such as
flatulence, constipation, and spells of colic, due no doubt to the
changes provoked by the elongated mesentery and bent or curved
intestine.When torsion takes place the attack is sudden and the
symptoms violent and urgent.Vomiting, meteorism, insuperable
constipation, and frequently tenesmus, are soon followed by collapse
and speedy death.The patient may die in twenty-four hours; he rarely
lives beyond the fourth day.In some cases excessive tenesmus and
bloody stools are seen in the early stages of torsion of the bowel.The
condition may be mistaken for intussusception, but can usually be
distinguished by the premonitory symptoms of twisting and by the more
rapid course, the sudden meteorism, and quick collapse of the latter.Still another way by which displacement of intestine may occasion
obstruction to the passage of its contents is when a portion of the
intestine has a long and narrow mesentery, and around this mesentery,
which is like a pedicle, another portion of the bowel is thrown,
encircling and compressing it.The accompanying figure, taken from
_Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, gives a good idea of this condition (Fig.It represents a {842} loop of the small intestine placed around
the mesenteric pedicle of the sigmoid flexure.Leichtenstern calls this
"intertwining or knotting of two intestinal loops."Anterior view of the strangulated intestine and
stricture._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal extremity.]Posterior view of the strangulated intestine
and stricture._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal extremity.]In consequence of inflammation of the peritoneum and effusion of lymph,
peritoneal surfaces are joined together, and before the lymph is fully
organized these surfaces are separated by the constant movements of the
organs and the change in the relationship of the parts, and strings and
bands of various shapes and sizes are formed in which a portion of the
intestine may become entangled and constricted.Sometimes the bowel
accidentally becomes engaged in a loop or noose of false membrane, or
becomes bound down under a band of fibrin; or, the peritoneal surfaces
of some of the organs having been joined together or to the wall of the
abdomen or pelvis, a loop of bowel may escape into a slit or opening
and become incarcerated; or a fold of bowel may fall into a fissure in
the omentum or mesentery or broad ligament of the uterus or suspensory
ligament of the liver, and become constricted; or the appendix
vermiformis may be twisted around the intestine in such a way as to
cause ligation of the tube, or, by becoming attached to some
neighboring part, it may form a loop through which the intestine may
pass and become obstructed.In the same way the bowel may be
constricted by a diverticulum.Bands entangling the bowel and causing strangulation may be
attached to the fimbriated process of the Fallopian tube or the ovary
or uterus.Indeed, it is impossible to describe in a limited space the
almost infinite ways in which these bands and strings may engage and
incarcerate the intestinal tube (Figs.{843} [Illustration: FIG.An appearance of the natural relations of
the diverticulum to the intestine._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal
extremity.]Internal strangulated hernia may result from the bowel falling into a
pouch of the peritoneum and becoming ligated by the orifice of the
pouch, or passing into the foramen of Winslow, of which there are three
cases of strangulation recorded; or a retro-peritoneal hernia may be
formed; or, more common still, a hernia of the intestine through the
diaphragm.In diaphragmatic hernia an opening is more frequently found in the
posterior part of this muscle.Two hundred and fifty-two cases of this
form of internal hernia have been collected by Leichtenstern, in which
the diagnosis was made in only five cases.He found the oesophageal
opening, a spot just behind the sternum, and a gap between the lumbar
and costal parts of the muscle, the weakest points in the diaphragm.Diaphragmatic and other forms of internal hernia may exist and not
produce symptoms of strangulation either at the time of formation or
subsequently, just as we so commonly see in cases of external hernia.When the bowel is constricted, however, and its circulation interfered
with, symptoms of internal strangulation come on, and are exactly like
the symptoms of external strangulated hernia.The attack is sudden, the
symptoms acute and urgent, and the course and termination very rapid.Unless the constriction is relieved death may take place in twenty-four
hours; life is rarely protracted beyond three or four days.The patient has first eructations, soon succeeded by nausea and
vomiting.The matter vomited consists of the contents of the stomach,
then of gastric fluid, bile, and the contents of the intestines.When
the last is ejected the vomiting is called fecal or stercoraceous.The
patient complains of a sense of constriction about the abdomen, griping
pains about the umbilicus, flatulence, tenesmus, and insuperable
constipation.One or two free stools from the large intestine below the
site of strangulation may be passed, but this should not deceive the
practitioner.As a rule, peritonitis soon follows strangulation.The
belly becomes tympanitic and tender, the pulse small and wiry, and the
face anxious.When gangrene supervenes the pain subsides, the pulse
becomes weak and intermittent, the surface cold and clammy, and the
patient soon dies in a state of collapse.Slight delirium may precede
death, or the mind remain unimpaired to the end.Very often, when
gangrene sets in and pain disappears, the patient has a grateful sense
of relief and is hopeful of recovery.{844} Intussusception, Invagination.One of the most frequent and important causes of intestinal obstruction
is intussusception or invagination of the bowel; by which term is meant
the protrusion or slipping of one portion of bowel into a portion
immediately adjoining.This condition is sometimes found after death in persons old or young,
but particularly the latter, in whom during life there were no symptoms
of intestinal obstruction or intestinal trouble of any kind.The
displaced intestine in these subjects is easily reduced, is unattended
by any signs of inflammation, and is evidently the result of spasmodic
contraction of the transverse muscular fibres of the bowel at one part,
with distension and relaxation at another part, by which, just before
death, one piece of the bowel is pushed into an adjacent piece.Not
unfrequently two or more invaginations are seen in the same subject.Flint[4] counted as many as fifteen in a child who died of typhoid
fever.This invagination of the death-struggle almost invariably
involves the small intestine, and may be the protrusion of a piece of
the bowel above into a piece immediately below, or the reverse, a
portion of bowel below being pushed into a portion above.It has been
suggested that this slight and temporary intussusception may occur
during life and give rise to temporary symptoms of intestinal
obstruction, which disappear when reduction of the displacement
spontaneously takes place.[Footnote 4: _Practice of Medicine_.]It will be seen by the diagrams that three successive portions of
intestine enter into the formation of an intussusception--an entering,
returning, and receiving portion.Two mucous surfaces and two serous
surfaces are thus brought into apposition.The mesentery attached to
the included lengths of bowel--viz.the entering and returning
lengths--is necessarily pulled down with the bowel in its descent, and
is also embraced by the receiving portion of the intestinal tube.The
traction excited by this portion of mesentery, thus wedged in between
the middle and inner layers of the bowel, materially alters what would
otherwise be the relationship of the parts.26 shows simple
invagination of the ileum like the finger of a glove, in consequence of
the traction exerted.The entering or invaginated portion does not
always lie in the axis of the enveloping tube, but is more or less
curved, until very often its lower orifice is in contact with the wall
of the outer layer.The concavity of this curve looks {845} toward the
mesenteric edge of the invaginated portion of bowel, and the convexity
toward the opposite side of the receiving portion.The convex side of
the middle cylinder is often thrown into transverse folds or
convolutions.Intussusception, which gives rise to symptoms
characteristic of intestinal obstruction during life, is invariably
from above downward.It is doubtful whether there is on record a single
well-authenticated case of inflammatory invagination where the lower
segment of bowel protruded into the upper.Reference to the diagrams will show that the lumen of the bowel is
diminished, and that more or less intestinal obstruction must follow
invagination.This obstruction is increased by the inflammation which
necessarily follows this condition.The large and numerous
blood-vessels of that portion of the mesentery involved in the
invagination are compressed and stretched; arterial supply, and
especially venous return, are interfered with; congestion quickly
follows, with copious inflammatory exudation; the layers of intestine
become swollen, and blood, sometimes in abundance, is poured out from
the mucous membrane.Peritonitis, limited sometimes to the invaginated
part, more often spreading to the peritoneum covering neighboring
structures, soon begins, and the contiguous serous surfaces are
agglutinated and the intussusception rendered irreducible.Lymph and
other inflammatory products are poured out freely; the coats of the
intestine become distended and thicker, and the inner and middle layers
of the invagination are separated by the deposit; the invaginated part
becomes more and more curved toward the mesenteric border of the outer
layer; and occlusion of the bowel, begun by the invagination, is made
more or less complete by the changes wrought by inflammation (Fig.That intestinal obstruction is not always complete in intussusception
is shown by the fact that fecal matter, often in considerable quantity,
is passed through the bent and narrowed tube, the intestine retaining,
at least for a time, its contractile power.The changes produced by
inflammation are chiefly seen in the inner and middle layers of
intestine, the receiving or outer layer of the invagination often
escaping any serious damage.These changes vary with the character and
duration of the inflammation.Sometimes they are limited to an
agglutination of the opposed serous membranes, an effusion of blood and
serum from the mucous surfaces, and an enormous distension and swelling
of all the invaginated parts; or the inflammation may end in
mortification of the middle or both the inner and middle cylinders, the
dead part coming away in shreds or in large fragments, or, if the
patient lives long enough, the entire invaginated tube being discharged
through the anus.If the inflammation involves the invaginated parts
unequally, strips and shreds of the bowel are detached by ulceration
and sloughing, and may escape in the discharge from the bowels in
pieces so small as to be unnoticed; but if the intussuscepted part dies
en masse, a circular line of demarcation is formed by ulceration, and
the dead segment is detached and drops into the cavity of the bowel
below, and escapes through the rectum.It is often so complete that the
inner and middle cylinders can be recognized, and the part of the
intestinal tube to which the expelled bowel belonged can be determined.In favorable cases the blood-vessels of the healthy bowel above and
below the dead segment pour out a circular mass of coagulable lymph,
which, becoming organized, closes the breach and {846} completes the
intestinal tube.To accomplish this it is necessary that the ends of
the two portions of bowel should be accurately coaptated: if they are
not, some opening may be left through which the contents of the gut may
escape into the peritoneal cavity, producing fatal peritonitis; or the
new formation may be imperfectly organized, and burst during some
peristaltic movement of the bowel or from the pressure of gas
accumulating in the gut; or the supply of lymph may be so redundant as
to obstruct the calibre of the bowel, or end in cicatricial
contraction, stricture, and obstruction.Aitken[5] records four
instances where the curved end of the invaginated portion of bowel by
prolonged pressure caused ulceration and perforation of the coats of
the enclosing bowel, the invaginated portion passing through the side
of the enclosing segment and projecting into the cavity of the
peritoneum.[Footnote 5: _Science and Practice of Medicine_.]Gangrene and ulceration, however, do not always follow intussusception.The mesenteric injuries may be sufficient to produce congestion and
exudation, and the patient survive the invagination for weeks, and
death eventually occur without sloughing or ulceration; or spontaneous
reduction of the invagination may take place and recovery of the
patient follow.The last termination must be rare, and impossible when
firm adhesion between the serous surfaces has taken place; but that it
does exceptionally occur is proved by cases where the diagnosis of
intussusception was undoubted, the invagination being felt in the
rectum or seen prolapsed through the anus.The most common termination,
if the patient survives, is mortification of the invaginated part and
separation in mass or by shreds or fragments.Intussusception may occur in any portion of the intestinal canal, but
some points are more liable to it than others.of the
cases collected by Brinton were ileo-caecal; in 32 per cent.the small
intestine alone was involved; 28 iliac and 4 jejunal; in 12 per cent.the colon, including its sigmoid flexure, was the part implicated.When the rectum is involved, it usually forms the outer layer of the
invagination, the middle and inner layers being formed by the bowel
which has passed from above into it; when prolapse of the rectum itself
occurs, the mucous membrane is generally alone involved, but along with
this the muscular coat may also descend and a true invagination of the
rectum be found.The most common variety of intussusception is the ileo-caecal.It is in
this form that we find the greatest length of bowel involved.This
invagination begins generally at the ileo-caecal valve, the lips of
which at first turn toward, and descend into, the cavity of the caecum,
drawing with them the end of the ileum; in this case the valve forms
the lowest point of the invagination.If the invagination continues,
the end of the caecum is next inverted; and if the process still goes
on, more and more of the colon is invaginated, until in some rare cases
it traverses the whole of the large intestine, appearing just above or
even protruding through the anus.In this variety the vermiform
appendix lies between the middle and inner layers of the
intussusception, and its opening, usually stretched and enlarged by the
inverted caecum and inflammatory effusion, is found close to the
ileo-caecal orifice.In this intussusception the caecum and colon are
large and roomy, and the invaginated portion not so liable, {847} as it
is when the small intestine is alone implicated, to strangulation and
sloughing; nor is there seen in ileo-caecal intussusception, unless the
portion of bowel involved is very short, the marked curvature of the
invaginated portion so commonly found in the small intestine.In the
ileo-caecal form it is twisted or much convoluted rather than bent.Another variety of ileo-caecal invagination--very rare, however--is
where the ileo-caecal orifice does not descend into the cavity of the
caecum, but the lower end of the ileum passes through the valve into
the large intestine.In this instance the invaginated portion is
tightly compressed by the valve, and strangulation is speedy and
complete.An invagination may occur in the lower part of the ileum, and
the inner and middle layers pass on to the ileo-caecal valve, and be
arrested at that point, and afterward, in consequence of violent
peristaltic action, the whole intussusception, inner, middle, and outer
layers, be invaginated into the colon.In this way the invagination
becomes doubled.While intussusception may occur in either sex and at all periods of
life, it happens nearly twice as often in males as in females, and is
most frequently seen in childhood.Leichtenstern[6] found in his
statistics of 473 cases that one-half were seen in children under ten
years old, and one-fourth of all intussusceptions occurred in children
from four to twelve months old.Invagination of the small intestine is
found almost exclusively in adults.Brinton from his records gives the
mean age of its occurrence 34.6 years.According to the same author,
the average age of ileo-caecal invaginations is 18.57 years, and
one-half of all cases of this form of intussusception observed by him
were in children under seven years of age.Leichtenstern states that
the lower part of the ileum is the most frequent site of invagination
in the small intestine, and the descending colon and sigmoid flexure
the most common portion involved in intussusception occurring in the
large intestine.cit._]

The mechanism of intussusception is probably not always the same.The
following is thought to be the most frequent process: A segment of
bowel becomes paralyzed by local peritonitis, some injury, diarrhoea,
or colic, and while in this state a segment of bowel above is subjected
to violent peristaltic action, and is forced into the unresisting
portion below.In this case the paretic segment forms the outer or
receiving layer of the intussusception.Leichtenstern believes that the
paretic portion is turned in and invaginated into the normal bowel
below, and that the clinical course of intussusception and post-mortem
appearance correspond with this explanation.If such is the case, the
paralyzed portion forms the inner layer, and the active bowel below the
receiving layer.Another theory, which applies with much force to the
most common of all invaginations--viz.the ileo-caecal--is, that as
violent anal tenesmus produces prolapse of the rectum, so prolonged and
powerful tenesmus at the ileo-caecal opening may cause prolapse of the
lips of this orifice, and, eventually, invagination of the ileum, or of
both this and the caecum, into the colon.When we remember that the
ileo-caecal valve is furnished with a sphincter muscle, the analogy is
complete.The idea so long entertained that intestinal worms may
occasion invagination of the bowel has generally been abandoned.A
polypoid tumor, by dragging down the portion of bowel to which it is
attached, may produce invagination; and {848} Brinton's statistics give
5 per cent.of cases of intussusception from this source.An
examination of a larger number of cases would probably show a much
smaller percentage due to this cause.A majority of cases of intussusception, however, take place suddenly,
without previous diarrhoea, colic, traumatism, or ill-health of any
kind, and probably occur without any tenesmus or paresis of a portion
of bowel.It may be that the longitudinal fibres of a segment of gut
contract, dilating and shortening a portion of the bowel; while this
part is distended a portion immediately above may be lengthened and
narrowed by contraction of the circular fibres, and violent peristalsis
going on at this moment, aided, possibly, by contraction of the
muscular wall of the abdomen, forces the upper and narrow segment into
the lower and dilated one.At first the invagination involves a small portion of the bowel, but,
active peristaltic action continuing, it rapidly increases in size.This increase is made at the expense of the sheath or outer layer,
which turns in to form the middle layer.The length of the invagination
varies from two or three inches to three, four, or five feet.The symptoms of intussusception generally come on suddenly, and
indicate both intestinal obstruction and inflammation.Pain resembling
violent colic, and referred to the site of the invagination, is a
prominent symptom.The pain is intense, paroxysmal in character, but
after a time it becomes continuous.At first pressure gives relief, but
in a few hours tenderness, denoting peritonitis, appears, limited to
the invagination or spreading gradually over the whole abdomen.Vomiting soon follows, and, with rare exceptions, is persistent.After
two or three days occasionally blood and sometimes fecal matter are
ejected from the stomach.Diarrhoea, with bloody, mucoid stools, is
rarely ever absent, and is characteristic of invagination.The patient
has from fifteen to twenty passages a day.If the large intestine is
involved, the diarrhoea is accompanied with tenesmus.Above the
obstruction gas and ingesta accumulate, and produce abdominal
distension, sometimes well marked.Generally the tumor formed by the
invagination can be felt through the abdominal wall, and is a symptom
of great importance.Meteorism and peritonitis may render the existence
of the tumor obscure or altogether prevent its recognition, but in
intussusception of the colon and at the ileo-caecal valve the solid
cylindrical mass can usually be found, and frequently, when the small
bowel alone is implicated, a very careful and patient examination will
enable the observer to detect it.Sometimes it changes its site, size,
and shape; occasionally it can be felt in the rectum or is seen
protruding through the anus.The urgency of the symptoms of invagination depends upon the portion of
bowel involved and the degree of constriction of the gut and its
attached mesentery.When the bowel is tightly constricted the symptoms
are acute, and the patient may die in a day or two; when the bowel is
not constricted the symptoms are chronic in character, and in the early
stages not urgent.The difference here is like that between
strangulated and incarcerated hernia.In acute cases the attack is sudden, obstruction complete, and the
symptoms those of internal strangulation of the bowel, often followed
by collapse, which may destroy life in a few hours.These cases are
{849} chiefly jejunal and iliac invaginations, and the higher up in the
small intestine the seat of obstruction the more violent and urgent the
symptoms.Constriction, being great, is followed by engorgement and
inflammation of the invaginated bowel, and if the patient lives long
enough gangrene ensues, by which the obstructing mass is separated and
discharged en masse or in fragments through the anus.Not unfrequently
life is saved in this way.That gangrene has taken place and separation
of the invaginated segments is in progress are often known by the very
fetid character of the evacuations and by their admixture with blood
and shreds of necrosed bowel.When the sequestrum has been detached
entire, it is often passed with difficulty.Frequently it lodges at
some point in the bowel, producing temporary obstruction and giving
rise to tenesmus and pain as it passes along the large intestine.There
is no doubt that the continuity of the intestine above and below the
neck of the invagination has been established, and complete cures
effected in the way already mentioned.Usually, however, the patient
dies from collapse, peritonitis, or perforation of the bowel before the
obstructing mass can be removed by gangrene.Children almost invariably
die before this can take place, and adults live from the seventh to the
fourteenth day, according to the greater or less violence and acuteness
of the symptoms.When the slough has been discharged and the continuity
of intestine established, recovery is still uncertain, and death very
often happens for reasons referred to in speaking of the separation of
the sequestrum.Separation of the invaginated portion and its expulsion, according to
Leichtenstern, in the majority of cases takes place from the eleventh
to the twenty-first day, but in chronic cases it is often delayed for
months.According to Brinton, separation of the sequestrum occurs
between the eighth and fifteenth in intussuscepted small intestine, and
between the fifteenth and twenty-second days in acute cases of
ileo-caecal and colic invaginations.In chronic cases of intussusception, which usually embrace the
ileo-caecal and colic varieties, strangulation is not common and the
course of the disease is protracted.These cases often last for several
months, and the symptoms are not always well defined.At first the pain
is paroxysmal, with long intervals of ease.Vomiting succeeds, but is
not persistent; discharge of the contents of the bowel below the seat
of lesion takes place and afterward fecal matter from above this point,
because the permeability of the bowel is not usually lost in chronic
cases.Eventually the alvine discharges become bloody, mucoid, and
characteristic of intussusception; the severity of the symptoms may
gradually increase, the pain becoming greater, more constant, the
vomiting more incessant, the discharges from the bowels more frequent,
and in one, two, or three months the patient dies from asthenia.Several authentic cases are related where the disease lasted one or two
years before terminating fatally.Very often some days before death the
pain and tenderness cease, and the operations become free from blood
and normal in character.Constipation is a prominent symptom in all of the conditions which give
rise to intestinal obstruction, and habitual constipation or loss of
the powers provided for the advance of the contents of the intestines
not unfrequently leads to permanent occlusion of the canal.It is
impossible to fix any definite rule as a standard of health for the
number and quantity of alvine evacuations.Some individuals have a
passage from the bowels once every day; others, in the enjoyment of as
good general health, suffer from the ordinary inconveniences of
constipation if they have less than two or three daily fecal
discharges; others, again, apparently equally as well, have a movement
from their bowels once in two or three days or once a week, or even
once in two weeks.Habershon[7] records the case of a "woman sixty
years old who from youth upward had had a passage from the bowels only
every six or eight days, and whose health had been perfect."A lady
under my own observation, for twenty years never had an alvine
discharge oftener than once in two weeks, and three times in her life
had passed two months without a movement of her bowels.This lady was
the mother of several children, and, although not in perfect health,
was able to attend to her ordinary household duties.Such cases are not
very uncommon, and occur, as far as I have been able to ascertain, more
frequently in women than in men.[Footnote 7: _On Diseases of the Abdomen_, quoted by Leichtenstern in
_Ziemssen's Cyc.The number of fecal evacuations and the quantity discharged have been
shown by Bischoff and Voit to depend, to some extent, upon the
character of the food ingested, vegetable diet producing abundant, and
animal diet scanty, stools.Doubtless, the quality of the food partly
explains the quantity of the alvine evacuation, although, to some
extent, this must depend upon the time that the feces remain in the
colon, a long residence there taking away a greater part of the watery
constituents and making the fecal mass thicker and harder; but the
variations in the number of stools in persons living on the same diet
can only be explained by the variations in the activity of the
peristaltic action in different individuals, or in the same individual
at different periods and under different surroundings.The causes of habitual constipation are of the most varied and
diversified character, and it is not always possible in an individual
case to point out the original or primary one.Not unfrequently several
causes are in operation at the same time to produce sluggishness of the
intestinal canal and constipation.Very often it begins with change of
scene and habits, by which the daily visit to the water-closet is
interfered with, or after confinement to bed with some temporary
indisposition.It is more likely to occur in men and women whose habits
are sedentary and who are constitutionally lazy and indolent.The feces
are allowed to remain in the rectum and colon, and every hour after the
ordinary time for going to stool diminishes the watery parts of the
fecal mass and makes it harder and more consistent.Many cases of
chronic constipation, begun in this way, have ended in dilatation and
thickening of the intestine, ulceration of the mucous membrane, and,
eventually, perforation of the coats and escape of the contents of the
gut into the peritoneal cavity.Rapid {851} excretion of water by the
kidneys, lungs, and skin produces constipation by withdrawing a large
proportion of the water from the fecal mass, rendering it unnaturally
dry and of diminished bulk.In diabetes, constipation arises from this
cause unless the patient makes up the loss by drinking an unusually
large quantity of water.Constipation in nursing-women is explained by
the loss of water in the secretion of milk.The profuse sweating which
attends malarial fever, phthisis, and other diseases readily accounts
for the constipation which often accompanies these disorders.Certain articles of food not necessary to mention here produce
constipation.They fail to excite peristaltic action; or articles of
diet which at first act as a stimulus to the bowels, and even provoke
temporary diarrhoea, lose their power if kept up too long--just as
certain purgative medicines lose their force if continued for too long
a period.Gradually they cease to increase the peristaltic action, and
rather add than otherwise to the inactivity of the intestines.Eating
the same kind of food day after day is very apt, sooner or later, to
result in diminished sensibility of the intestinal canal, a reduction
of the peristaltic force, and deficiency in the secretion of the
digestive juices, which in itself is a common cause of constipation.Frequent change of diet is generally needed to supply the stimulus
necessary for that intestinal motion which relieves the bowels.Bile is looked upon as one of the most powerful agents in stimulating
peristaltic action, and when, from any cause, mechanical or otherwise,
it is not poured into the bowel, constipation ensues.Unnatural
flexures, congenital or acquired, of the large intestine are not
unfrequently the source of chronic constipation.These flexures, normal
or factitious, favor accumulation of feces, especially in subjects who
have diminished sensibility of the bowel and a paretic state of the
muscular coat.Certain injuries and diseases of the brain and spinal
cord reduce, and sometimes altogether prevent, intestinal activity.Hysteria, if it exist for any length of time, is generally attended by
sluggishness of the bowels, and great mental depression (melancholia)
is sometimes preceded and sometimes followed by habitual constipation.In treating such a case it is important to make the distinction.Temporary paralysis of the muscular coat of the bowel, followed by
symptoms of intestinal constriction, with insuperable constipation,
sometimes attends violent contusion of the abdomen.In some cases
prolonged functional weakness of the muscular coat follows the injury.Many chronic diseases leave the bowel in a sluggish condition by the
pathological changes produced in the intestine.The function of the
muscular coat is frequently injured by the infiltration which
accompanies peritonitis.The fibres are separated by the serous
effusion which attends this inflammation; they become overstretched,
and, losing their contractility, end in paralysis and obstinate
constipation.Occlusion of the canal from this cause may last for days,
and be accompanied with tympanitis, stercoraceous vomiting, and all the
signs of internal strangulation, ending in death.Post-mortem
examinations in such cases show no stricture or unnatural diminution in
the size of the canal, but that the fatal occlusion was due to
paralysis of the muscular coat of the bowel and arrest of its power.The normal advance of the contents of the bowel is interfered with by
any cause which lessens the contractility of the muscular coat.Chronic
{852} diseases which debilitate the general muscular system affect at
the same time the contractile power of the muscular coat of the canal,
and the debility and degeneration of old age are felt here, and
sometimes occasion the constipation which often accompanies this period
of life.Leichtenstern[8] says that chronic intestinal catarrh is a
common factor of constipation--that when this catarrh is of long
standing it produces relaxation of the muscular coat and diminishes the
elasticity of the intestinal walls.He believes that this pathological
condition exists in a large proportion of the cases of habitual
constipation attended with mental depression, that the hypochondriasis
makes its appearance after the constipation has become chronic, and
that it is a secondary symptom.This affection is located chiefly in
the small intestine, and does not usually involve the colon.cit._]

Probably the most common form of chronic constipation is that which
accompanies loss of sensibility and muscular inactivity of the colon
and rectum.The large bowel becomes sometimes so distended by the
accumulated fecal masses that it has been found after death to measure
ten or fifteen inches in circumference and to contain an astonishing
quantity of feces.Any part of the canal, except the last two inches of
the rectum, which is kept empty by the contraction of the sphincters,
may be occupied by the mass, but the accumulation is greatest in the
rectum, caecum, and sigmoid flexure.At the last-named location the
distension is so great that the mass can be readily felt through the
abdominal walls.The tumor may be as large as a foetal head, and may be
mistaken for a simple or malignant tumor of the omentum, stomach, or
other organ, or for pregnancy or ovarian growth.The dilatation may be
so enormous as to push the small intestines into the back part of the
abdominal cavity and to interfere with the function of any organ upon
which it encroaches.It may press upon the concave surface of the
liver, and, arresting the flow of bile, produce jaundice or
mechanically interfere with some portion of the track of the urinary
organs and <DW36> their functions.When situated in a portion of the
canal not tightly attached to the abdominal walls it is slightly
movable, more or less hard and consistent, according to its duration,
for it remains often for months unchanged, sometimes giving to the
fingers the impression of a rather soft, easily-indented swelling with
a uniform smooth surface--more often feeling like a hard, irregular,
elongated, and corrugated mass of fecal balls.Contraction here and
there of bundles of the circular muscular fibres of the gut produces
the irregular, corrugated impression imparted to the fingers.Their
shape and position may sometimes be changed by pressure through the
abdominal wall.If the accumulation occurs in the rectum, the
introduction of a tube or bougie is prevented by the impacted mass,
which can be gotten away only by the fingers or by some instrument.The
colon and rectum may be dilated to their utmost capacity with an
enormous amount of feces, enough to fill a common-sized pail, and both
the patient and medical attendant be deceived as to the sufferer's
condition by the fact that he has his daily number of stools.The
semi-fluid contents of the small intestines find their way through this
mass by some irregular and uncertain track, undermining and breaking
down sometimes a lump of the old fecal accumulation, which, if small in
size or broken up, may pass on and {853} escape by the anus, but if
large and hard may drop into the irregular and uncertain passage and
permanently close it; then sudden and complete intestinal occlusion
takes place, with all of its fearful consequences.If this, however,
should not occur, and the accumulation is not recognized and removed,
the enormous dilatation may go on until complete paralysis of the
muscular coat is produced, and entire stoppage of the current of feces,
with permanent occlusion of the bowel; or before this takes place
ulceration may set in, partly because of the great pressure of the
fecal mass upon the mucous membrane, and partly from the irritating
character of the contents of the bowel.Ulceration begins, most likely,
at some point where resistance is greatest, and perforation of the
bowel may ensue.SYMPTOMS.--If the accumulation occupies only a portion of the colon, as
the caecum or sigmoid flexure, the distended part may become displaced
and twisted on its long axis.This condition scarcely ever happens in
the large intestines except at the parts mentioned.Torsion of the
caecum rarely takes place except in persons of from forty-five to sixty
years of age, while twisting of the sigmoid flexure may happen at any
period of life.When distended and very heavy from the weight of feces,
with probably some congenital defect about its mesenteric attachment,
the sigmoid flexure may become twisted and drop into the pelvis,
producing at once symptoms of internal strangulation.Individuals accustomed to having one or more alvine evacuations a day
are made uncomfortable by two or three days of constipation.A feeling
of distension about the abdomen, with flatulence and heat, follows this
condition, and soon afterward headache, loss of appetite, and symptoms
of indigestion supervene.If this state of the bowels continues
unrelieved, pressure upon the hemorrhoidal veins takes place and
interference with venous return, producing congestion in the lower end
of the rectum.This is attended by straining, diarrhoea, evolution of
gaseous matter, colicky pains, and possibly sympathetic disturbance of
the genito-urinary organs.When at last the hardened and enlarged mass
is discharged, it produces some pain and burning about the anus, with
possibly rupture of the mucous membrane in that region.Fissure of the
anus may thus originate.In the case of a lad aged about nine years
under my care fissure of the anus began in this way, and after its
formation the pain of defecation was so intense that he resisted for
ten days every attempt of his bowels to move.After this time he passed
every day or two one or more hardened fecal balls, but always with such
atrocious pain that he looked forward to the next attempt with terror.This case ended in fecal impaction, which nearly proved fatal.Not unfrequently persons who habitually go two or three days without
having a passage from the bowels are not apparently inconvenienced, and
after a time any of the discomforts ordinarily felt from constipation
are not noticed, if indeed any exist.Generally, however, chronic constipation leads to a host of troubles of
the most varied character.There is not an organ in the body that is
not more or less influenced by it.The generation of gas in the
intestines produces a sense of fulness of the abdomen and elevation of
the diaphragm which interferes with the action of the lungs and heart.The sufferer is oppressed, sighs, and has difficult respiration and
attacks of {854} palpitation of the heart.The influence of the
abdominal pressure is conducted by the sympathetic nerves to the brain,
and the patient frequently has vertigo, headache, ringing in the ears,
faintness, etc., and in consequence of the pressure upon other nerves
or of hyperaemia of the spinal cord and its membranes he has dull
aching pains in his back, groins, genitals, or extremities.I have seen
in several instances pain in the legs, coming on after the patient has
retired and lasting until morning, violent enough to prevent sleep, at
once permanently relieved by an active cathartic after antiperiodics,
alteratives, and anodynes had failed to do any good.A patient suffering from habitual constipation usually obtains
temporary relief by the bowels acting either spontaneously or after a
dose of medicine; but, the causes of constipation continuing, the
physical discomforts and suffering continue, varied in every
conceivable way.His digestion being disturbed, appetite poor, and
assimilation imperfect, he gradually loses flesh and his complexion
becomes sallow and unhealthy.In addition to this, he soon grows
irritable and fretful, trifling affairs trouble him, he has fits of
great mental depression, and soon settles down into hypochondriasis,
his life becoming a burden to himself and a nuisance to his friends.If the constipation ends in fecal accumulation, the worst symptoms of
mechanical obstruction may present themselves at any time, and death of
the individual follow.The practitioner should always keep this fact in
mind in treating every case of intestinal obstruction, and search for
fecal impaction by examining the rectum and the whole length of the
large intestine through the anterior abdominal wall.Very often
symptoms of impaction come on gradually in one who has been ailing for
some weeks or months, but sometimes the onset is as sudden as in a case
of acute occlusion of the intestines.The patient is seized with pain
like that of colic and an urgent desire to empty his bowels, but all
attempts to do this are futile, and the straining is followed by great
exhaustion; borborygmus, nausea, vomiting, and possibly hiccough, soon
come on, with tympanitic distension of the belly.If the impaction is
not overcome, death by collapse or from peritonitis follows.Post-mortem examination shows enormous fecal accumulation, peritonitis
as a consequence of the obstruction, perforating ulcer in some part of
the large bowel, more often the sigmoid flexure, or, in some cases,
absolute rupture of the caecum itself, and escape of its contents into
the peritoneal cavity.In a report by George Pollock[9] of 127 cases of intestinal
obstruction, 77 belonged to the above class; and Brinton, in his
analysis of the whole group of cases collected by him, says stricture
constitutes about 73 per cent.In 124 cases of intestinal obstruction
reported by Mr.Bryant[10] from the post-mortem records of Guy's
Hospital, 47 were found to be stricture of the bowel.The above
statements show that stricture, or diminution of the calibre of the
bowel, is the most frequent cause of {855} intestinal obstruction, and
the subject is worthy of our earnest consideration.[Footnote 9: _Medico-Chirurgical Review_, 1853.][Footnote 10: _Practice of Surgery_.]While stricture of the bowel may be found in any portion of the
intestinal canal, it occurs most frequently in the sigmoid flexure and
rectum.Brinton found in 100 fatal cases of stricture 30 in the rectum
and 30 in the sigmoid flexure; only 8 cases in 100 were in the small
intestine.Brinton's statistics correspond very nearly with those of
other writers.The affection is more common in men than women, and the
average age at death is about forty-four years.The most common cause of stricture is contraction following
cicatrization of ulcers of the mucous and submucous coats of the
intestine.The ulcer may involve the circumference of the bowel, and
the resulting cicatrix terminate in uniform constriction of its lumen,
or the ulceration may extend several inches along the side of the
intestine, ultimately causing contraction in the direction of its
longitudinal axis, marked stenosis, and kinking of the gut.When
ulceration, continuous or in patches, involves a large extent of bowel,
it may reduce the gut to a mass of indistinguishable cicatricial
tissue.Bristowe[11] says he has seen the whole caecum thus contracted
"into a channel barely capable of admitting a goose's quill."[Footnote 11: Reynolds's _System of Medicine_.]Stricture of the intestine often follows dysentery or tubercular and
syphilitic ulceration of the bowel.Follicular or hemorrhoidal
ulceration is sometimes the beginning of a stenosis which ends in
stricture of the rectum.Stercoral ulcers of the colon are not
unfrequently the starting-point of cicatricial contraction of the
calibre of the bowel.Sometimes, but rarely, ulcers of typhoid fever
end in constriction of the intestinal tube.The diameter of the gut is
also contracted by the effects of caustic substances, by ulceration
following the lodgment of foreign bodies, and by effusion of lymph or
thickening attendant upon long-standing hernia.Very often after death
it is impossible to determine what particular kind of inflammation and
ulceration caused the stricture.Generally, the cause which provokes
the ulceration sets up chronic peritonitis, which materially aids in
producing the obstruction.Spasm of the circular muscular fibres
usually accompanies these lesions, and materially contributes in many
cases to fatal intestinal obstruction.Some authors assert that spasm
without organic change can produce acute obstruction: such an
occurrence, except possibly in the rectum, must be very rare, if indeed
it ever happens.The most common cause of stricture is cancer.This disease may
originate in the bowel itself, or, beginning in some neighboring organ
or tissue, gradually spreads and involves the gut.It may extend around
the bowel or be infiltrated along the sides of the canal for several
inches, and may be scirrhous, medullary, or epithelial in character.of the cases of cancer of the bowel are situated in
the rectum.Usually, but not invariably, cancerous deposits are found
in persons who have passed middle age.An impediment to the passage of fecal matter is invariably produced in
constriction of the intestine from the above causes, and it frequently
continues until fatal occlusion occurs.The contents of the bowel
accumulate above the block, producing distension of the gut and
thickening of the muscular coats above the stricture, with contraction
and atrophy {856} of the portion of intestine below.Dilatation of the
bowel above the seat of lesion is sometimes great enough to cause
rupture and peritoneal extravasation, or distension and stretching of
the coats of the canal may be sufficient to interfere with its
circulation, and ulceration ensue.Occasionally cases of stricture or well-marked circumscribed
contraction of the bowel are seen which give rise to no marked symptoms
of constriction during life.Such was the case in the instance related
by Bristowe and referred to above.These instances are, however,
exceptional in the large intestine.Symptoms of stricture vary according to the site, cause, and extent of
the lesion.They are gradually developed, and in this respect are
unlike the symptoms of internal strangulation or of intussusception,
which are generally acute and rapid in their course.When the
obstruction in stricture is complete, progress toward death is
comparatively slow.If the stricture is seated in the small intestine,
the symptoms are often so obscure that for a long time the presence of
the contraction may not be suspected; the contents of the small bowel
are usually fluid, and in this state readily pass through the
constricted part.The more solid the contents of the bowel, the greater
the difficulty in passing a contracted and narrow orifice, and the more
conclusive and characteristic the assemblage of symptoms of obstruction
from stricture.The history of a case of intestinal obstruction from stricture is often
instructive.For weeks or months there have been colicky pains and
intestinal disorder; possibly, in the early stages, diarrhoea, but
later marked constipation, and probably previous attacks where
constipation was for a time insuperable and death from obstruction
imminent.Hemorrhage, except in cancer or when complicated with piles,
is rare.The attack may come on suddenly, or constipation become more
and more difficult to overcome; violent peristalsis presents itself,
accompanied by pain and abdominal distension, and followed by nausea
and vomiting, the latter often being stercoraceous.During the throes
of pain--for it is paroxysmal--the outline of the distended gut can be
felt and seen through the abdominal walls if they are thin and free
from fat.Unless the stricture is relieved the patient gradually dies
from asthenia.Inflammation is often absent throughout, but enteritis
or peritonitis may come on, or perforation and peritoneal extravasation
ensue and hasten the fatal termination.When the obstruction is in the rectum it can be felt with the finger;
if in the sigmoid flexure, it may be felt with a gum bougie or probe,
but the use of the former is unreliable, and the latter, unless
carefully employed, dangerous.Obstruction at this point, however, is
attended with marked distension of the descending and transverse colon.If seated in the small bowel, the large intestine is flaccid and
collapsed.Careful manual exploration often enables the practitioner to
determine the site of the contraction.Weight, pain, dulness, and
fulness are usually found about the stricture, but these signs may be
of little value when the abdominal wall is thick and unyielding, or
peritonitis or tumor is present, or the contracted portion of bowel is
compressed or drawn out of its proper site.Brinton suggests that the
site of stricture may be determined by the quantity of water which can
be injected through the anus into the bowel.Such an estimation must
often be erroneous, as stricture {857} is rarely ever complete and
fluid may be forced through the constricted part.Indeed, Battey of
Georgia has demonstrated upon dead and living subjects that fluid may
be made to pass through the entire canal from the anus to the stomach.Obstruction due to cancer of the rectum can be determined by digital
examination.When seated in the small intestine or higher up in the
large bowel, the presence of a painful tumor, preceded for weeks by
evidences of impaired nutrition, emaciation, and followed by
lancinating pain, cancerous cachexia, etc., will indicate the character
of the trouble.Compression and Contraction of the Bowel.Obstruction of the bowel is sometimes occasioned by compression or
traction exerted on the intestine by abdominal tumors or cysts.Fibrous
tumors of the uterus, ovarian cysts, hydatid growths, or indeed any
form of abdominal tumor, may by pressure on some part of the intestinal
track produce fatal obstruction.Several inches of bowel may thus be
compressed and rendered impervious, or if traction is exerted by the
tumor, which is often adherent to the bowel, the tube may be sharply
bent or twisted and its action interfered with.A case is reported of
compression of the bowel from a great accumulation of fat about the
colon.Adhesions of intestinal coils from chronic peritoneal
inflammatory changes constitute a large and important class of cases of
intestinal obstruction.This condition is known as contraction of the
bowels: 23 of the 124 cases reported by Bryant were of this character.The usual site of stricture is the large bowel: contraction is far more
frequently seen in the small intestine, and is caused by an effusion of
lymph following simple peritonitis or the inflammation attending the
formation of cancer or tubercle of the peritoneum.Coils of intestine
are matted together or to neighboring parts in this way by bands of
lymph or false membranes, and the action of the bowel interfered with
or obstructed.Constriction of a length of bowel may be found after
death, or a sharp, angular bend by which complete obstruction has been
produced.Circumscribed peritonitis may produce adhesion of a portion of bowel by
bands of lymph to the uterus or its appendages, or to some part of the
large intestine, or to the abdominal wall, and the action of the bowel
become embarrassed by traction, constriction, or bending.In
consequence of the irritation following this condition, spasmodic
contraction may follow and add to the difficulty, or enteritis may
ensue; and this will especially be the case if the circulation of the
part is interfered with, and render complete what before was a partial
obstruction.Distension and fulness of the bowel above the obstruction,
with contraction and emptiness of the portion of the gut below, are
found after death in cases of contraction, just as we see in fatal
cases of stricture.The history of the case and presence of a tumor
will generally enable the practitioner to determine when obstruction is
due to the presence of some adventitious growth.When contraction is
complicated with the presence of tubercle or cancer, symptoms attending
these conditions will be present.Obstruction of the intestines from contraction generally comes on {858}
insidiously.The patient may date the beginning of his trouble from an
old attack of circumscribed peritonitis which probably took place weeks
or months before.He has attacks of colicky pains, indigestion, and
constipation.The last is difficult to overcome, continuing for hours
before it is relieved by medicine or the efforts of nature.During the
attack of almost insurmountable constipation violent peristaltic
movement of the bowel above the impediment may be noticed.The patient
may gradually become more and more feeble from suffering and
interference with nutrition, and die from exhaustion, or fits of
obstinate constipation may continue to recur, until finally one of them
becomes insuperable and fatal.The symptoms of contraction closely resemble those of stricture, but it
is important to distinguish one from the other, as the treatment,
especially if surgical interference is demanded, is very different.A
rigid analysis of all of the signs will usually, but not invariably,
enable the practitioner to make the distinction.There is an important difference between the constipation of stricture
and that of contraction.In the former the difficulty is in defecation,
emptying the large bowel, the usual site of stricture; in the latter
the difficulty is in the passage of the contents of the gut along the
narrowed and contracted small intestine, the common site of
contraction.In stricture the calibre of the bowel is diminished by
some sharply-defined mechanical impediment seated in the cavity or in
the walls of the tube; in contraction the bowel is bent or kinked by
adhesions, or coils of intestine are matted and glued together and
peristalsis interfered with.In stricture defecation is difficult and
painful; in contraction the alvine discharges are painless.In the
former blood and mucus are not unfrequently seen in the feces; in the
latter the motions are healthy.In stricture constipation alternates
with diarrhoea; in contraction looseness of the bowels is rarely seen.In stricture distension of the abdomen is lumbar and epigastric; in
contraction the distension is less and is central and hypogastric.In
both conditions violent distinct peristaltic action is seen during a
fit of constipation, and in both the bowel above the constriction is
distended and hypertrophied.In contraction the powerful, writhing
peristalsis involves the small intestine above the impediment, and in
stricture the large bowel above the obstruction.In both stricture and
contraction inflammation of the bowel and peritoneum may supervene.In
contraction, when inflammation sets in or when enteritis and
peritonitis are absent and the attack of constipation is
insurmountable, I have noticed that the symptoms are more urgent and
rapid in their course, and danger of death from collapse greater, than
when these conditions exist in stricture.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.--In every case of intestinal obstruction a
careful examination should be made for external strangulated hernia.All of the regions of the abdomen in which hernia may occur should be
thoroughly inspected, as the symptoms of the two conditions are
identical.A small or incomplete external strangulated hernia may
easily be overlooked.An individual with an old hernia may suddenly
have symptoms of intestinal obstruction, and it may be doubtful whether
the obstruction is due to internal constriction or to the external
hernia.Diagnosis is especially difficult when the chronic hernia is
irreducible in character.If the cause {859} of the impermeability is
internal and below the external hernia, that portion of intestine in
the hernial tumor becomes swollen, tense, and hard, and closely
resembles the local symptoms of strangulated hernia.If the external
hernia is reducible, reduction en masse may take place and a
retro-peritoneal hernia be formed.When the case is doubtful and
urgent, an operation for strangulated hernia should be performed.Functional obstruction of the bowel is sometimes seen, closely
simulating obstruction from one of the structural changes mentioned.Cases of functional obstruction are seen usually in hysterical or
nervous women, and are generally recognized by the history, course, and
termination of the malady.The fact that local enteritis, peritonitis,
or typhlitis, by paralyzing a portion of the bowel, may produce all the
signs of acute and complete obstruction, should not be lost sight of.In cases of congenital stricture or malformation, or the presence of
foreign bodies in the intestine, or acute internal strangulation, or
twisting of a length of bowel, and generally in intussusception,
symptoms of acute obstruction are present.The individual may have been
in perfect health, and suddenly symptoms of the gravest character set
in.Intense pain, referred to some special part of the belly, is the
first sign of trouble.Nausea soon follows, and with it great
prostration; the depression of vital power approaches, and sometimes
reaches, syncope; the patient rolls and tosses in agony; his mental
distress is equally great, and if old enough he is conscious of his
danger and is anxious and despondent.Vomiting succeeds the nausea: at
first the contents of the stomach, and then those of the small
intestines, are thrown up; after a time the vomiting is stercoraceous.The belly becomes swollen, tympanitic, and exquisitely tender; the
weight of the bed-clothes or the slightest touch of the finger upon his
abdomen is intolerable; he keeps his head and shoulders raised and his
lower limbs retracted to avoid pressure of the abdominal muscles.If the abdominal wall is
thin, the violent motion of the intestines can be seen and felt through
it.These painful peristaltic movements of the bowel are paroxysmal and
attended by loud rumbling or gurgling noises.The pain gradually
increases; the patient is very restless and complains of great thirst;
his pulse is small, hard, and frequent, his extremities cool and
features pinched.If not soon relieved, exhaustion comes on; he has
muttering delirium, cold clammy perspiration, hiccough, twitching of
the tendons, and death soon follows from collapse or from peritonitis
or gangrene, or from both.The average period of death is from six to
eight days.It may occur in thirty-six or forty-eight hours, or the
patient may last for two weeks.In congenital occlusion and malformation the history of the case, the
age of the patient, and the fact that the deformity in such cases is
almost always confined to the anus and rectum, usually render the
diagnosis sufficiently easy.Obstruction caused by foreign bodies impacted in the intestines can
generally be diagnosed.The history of the case may show that foreign
bodies have been swallowed or that the patient has been subjected to
some of the conditions which cause the formation of enteroliths.These
stony concretions are usually found in the caecum or colon, and
frequently give rise for days and weeks to symptoms of indigestion,
emaciation, {860} constipation, and other evidences of bad health
before complete occlusion of the intestine takes place.Not
unfrequently, before the sudden attack of impermeability of the bowel
the patient has had repeated attacks of typhlitis, and has been
conscious for a long time of the presence of a tumor in the region of
the caecum or colon.Possibly he has passed on some former occasion
pieces of the stony concretion.Diagnosis of obstruction by gall-stones is often aided by the fact that
the patient has recently suffered characteristic pains of hepatic colic
and by the icterous condition of the skin.Possibly the individual has
suffered repeated attacks of hepatic trouble and has previously passed
a gall-stone.Obstruction from this cause is seen four times as often
in women as in men, and always after the middle period of life.In obstruction occasioned by internal hernia or the presence of
membranous bands, loops, mesenteric pouches, the symptoms are often
such as to baffle all attempts at accurate and certain diagnosis.The
onset of the symptoms is sudden and the course of the disease rapid;
prostration of vital power is extreme, sometimes amounting to syncope;
vomiting incessant and persistent; pain constant and fixed.The most
characteristic symptom of internal strangulation is the very great and
prolonged depression of vital power; it occurs generally in early adult
life.Erichsen states that in twisting of the bowel the abdomen is unevenly
distended, it being tympanitic on one side and flattened on the other.This condition of the bowel is usually seen after middle age.In
intussusception the principal signs are, usually, the early age of the
patient--obstruction from other causes in children being rare--the
suddenness of the onset of symptoms, the frequent desire to go to
stool, the tenesmus, and the characteristic bloody mucus discharges.By
abdominal palpation frequently the sausage-like tumor can be
recognized, and very often the intussuscepted part can be felt in the
rectum or seen protruding through the anus.When invagination involves
the upper part of the small intestine, diagnosis of the cause of
occlusion is almost impracticable.In obstruction of the bowel from fecal accumulation, inflamed and
thickened intestine, stricture, compression and traction, and
contraction of the gut from cancerous deposit, the symptoms are
gradually presented and chronic in character.They are unlike the signs
of acute obstruction, which occur in persons apparently in perfect
health and are sudden and violent from the beginning.In chronic
obstruction of the intestine the patient has probably been complaining
for some time, with symptoms of abdominal trouble.He has been unwell
for weeks, his appetite poor, digestion disordered, strength
diminished, and bowels constipated.The last symptom is the most
distressing of all.Purgatives do not give the relief ordinarily
obtained, but add to the griping, colicky pains, nausea, and general
depression.When his bowels do act, the stool is sometimes liquid,
sometimes very hard (scybalous), or the form of the matter passed is
tape-like or pipe-like.Sometimes, in his frequent attempts at stool,
the only discharge is blood and mucus or pus.Attacks of eructation and
vomiting often take place during the progress of the disease.Stercoraceous vomiting is, however, rare, and only seen in the later
period of the attack.Abdominal distension is slow in making its
appearance, but after a time is well marked, and due more to tympanitis
than to {861} constipation; the tympanitic distension is accompanied by
loud rumbling and gurgling noises in the bowels.After a period which
varies much in different cases, inflammation, suddenly or gradually, is
set up, and all the symptoms of acute obstruction are presented,
grafted on signs of chronic occlusion.We have pain, nausea, vomiting,
great distension and tenderness of the abdomen, peristalsis plainly
seen and felt if the abdominal wall is thin, the small, frequent, wiry
pulse, clammy perspiration, prostration with hiccough, tendinous
twitchings, and death, very like that following a case of external
strangulated hernia.Obstruction due to fecal accumulation generally happens in persons who
have passed middle age, and can often be diagnosed by digital rectal
examination and palpation of the abdomen, by the presence of fecal
tumors, and the history of long-existing constipation with its manifold
consequences; previous attacks of impermeability, and relief by
discharge of enormous masses of feces.Obstruction caused by the presence of some abdominal tumor is generally
known by the history of the case, the fact of the existence of the
tumor being known to the patient or discovered by the physician by an
examination through the abdominal walls or through the vagina or
rectum.The progress of such cases is essentially chronic, but acute
symptoms may at any time come on.Diagnosis of obstruction due to
stricture is frequently made by examination of the rectum and sigmoid
flexure, the usual sites of constriction from this cause.Complete
occlusion from stricture is almost always preceded by well-marked
premonitory symptoms.When the obstruction is situated in the lower part of the colon and
rectum, its precise seat can be determined by digital or manual
examination or the use of a bougie or tube.When the site of
obstruction is above the sigmoid flexure, it is difficult, and
occasionally impossible, to determine its exact locality.As a rule,
when the constriction is in the small intestine the symptoms are acute
and urgent; pain is intense, vomiting comes on soon, and prostration is
early and extreme.When the large intestine is involved, except in
volvulus, the symptoms are generally chronic.In twisting of the gut
the symptoms are rapid and uncommonly severe.The higher up the
obstruction, the earlier stercoraceous vomiting begins.Above the
constriction the bowel is distended and tympanitic; below the
constriction it is generally collapsed.In obstruction of the large
intestine the outline of the tympanitic and distended gut may be traced
with the eye and hand.In constriction of the small intestine the
secretion of urine, as has been shown by Hilton, G. Bird, and Barlow,
is less than where obstruction is seated in the large bowel.Besides
rectal and vaginal examinations, which should never be neglected in any
case of intestinal obstruction, abdominal palpation may also aid in
determining the site of constriction.It should not be forgotten,
however, when a tumor is found--as, for instance, in invagination--that
the bowel may be displaced; a distended caecum may be pushed into and
occupy the left side of the belly.Cases are not uncommon where the
symptoms are so combined and uncertain as to render accurate diagnosis
of the site of obstruction impracticable.Very little light is thrown upon the diagnosis by pain, constipation,
or vomiting when these symptoms are considered separately.Pain is
common to many diseases of the abdomen; obstinate constipation, lasting
for {862} days and weeks, is often seen where there is no mechanical
obstruction; and vomiting attends many morbid conditions of the body.But when these symptoms are combined and examined along with the
history of the case and mode of invasion, they are often characteristic
of constriction of the intestine.Pain in acute obstruction is fixed,
umbilical, and intermittent; in chronic cases it is more diffused and
increases with the distension.In acute cases constipation is complete
and insuperable; in chronic cases this symptom gradually increases; in
intussusception we have frequent discharges of a dysenteric character,
and hemorrhage, sometimes copious, when the small bowel is involved.The bowel below the seat of complete constriction may be full of fecal
matter, and the discharge of this spontaneously or by the aid of
enemata may induce the attendant not to regard the case as one of
occlusion.Stercoraceous vomiting, as a rule, comes on early in acute
and late in chronic cases of complete occlusion of the gut; in
spasmodic ileus or impermeability not due to mechanical occlusion
feculent vomiting is only occasionally seen.The duration of life in acute intestinal obstruction varies very much
in different cases: death may ensue in a few hours or not for ten or
twelve days; the average period is six days.The duration depends upon
the site of the constriction and the mechanical injury to the bowel;
the nearer to the pylorus the constriction, the more rapid the
progress.In volvulus involving the sigmoid flexure, when injury to the
bowel is great, the symptoms are acute in the extreme.After
peritonitis or enteritis begins, progress toward a fatal issue is very
rapid, the patient rarely living more than three or four days.In
occlusion from stricture, compression, fecal impaction, and chronic
intussusception the patient may live for weeks or even months.The statistics of Leichtenstern show that from 5 to 10 fatal cases of
intestinal obstruction occur every year among every 100,000
inhabitants; and according to the mortuary records of England an
average of 1 death from this cause is seen in every 260 deaths.Brinton
reports 1 death from intestinal obstruction in every 280 deaths; his
statement is based upon 12,000 promiscuous autopsies.The first author
states that the statistical reports of the general hospital of Vienna
inform us that out of 60 cases of ileus, 6 or 10 per cent.This report, however, is too meagre to be of much value.From Brinton's
statistics of 500 deaths from obstruction we find that out of 100
cases, 43 are intussusception, 17 stricture, 4.8 impaction of
gall-stones, 27.2 internal strangulation, and 8 torsion.TREATMENT.--There are few conditions of the body which cause the
practitioner more anxiety and embarrassment than cases of intestinal
obstruction, and when the precise seat and nature of the occlusion are
not known the treatment is almost entirely empirical.The distinction,
however, between acute and chronic cases of obstruction of the bowels,
or of acute supervening upon chronic symptoms, can almost always be
made, and a patient investigation of the history of the case, the mode
of invasion, and a rigid analysis of all the symptoms presented will
generally enable the attendant to come to some positive conclusion as
to the cause and site of the occlusion.One fact in the treatment which
cannot be too strongly impressed upon the mind, especially of the young
practitioner, is not to use purgatives and irritating enemata, formerly
so much in vogue, {863} in the hope of forcing a passage through the
occluded bowel.The patient is urgently solicitous for medicine which
will open his bowels, but the use of purgatives to overcome internal
strangulation is as senseless and hurtful as when used to overcome the
constipation of external strangulated hernia.These agents only add to
the nausea, vomiting, pain, and peristalsis.The latter is violent
enough already to render coils of intestine visible, and with every
paroxysm is adding to the entanglement and impermeability.It is said
that cathartics in some instances have unlocked the bowel in intestinal
obstruction: these cases are exceptional, and many of them were
probably functional and not structural in character.The only exception
to the rule of avoiding purgatives is as stated by Jonathan Hutchinson:
"In certain cases when impaction of feces is suspected, and in cases of
stricture when fluidity of feces is desirable."Formerly, some of the best practitioners resorted to the exhibition of
one or two pounds of quicksilver, in the hope of overcoming intestinal
obstruction by the weight of the metal.This plan has properly been
almost if not quite abandoned.Crude mercury is very slow to reach the
obstruction, is divided into small portions by the peristalsis, which
its presence increases, and if it should finally arrive at the point of
constriction in any considerable quantity, it is more liable to add to
than overcome the difficulty.The great remedy in intestinal constriction is opium, in large or small
and repeated doses.Its use arrests the vomiting, stops the pain, and
quiets the violent movements of the bowel.Very often by it the
intestine is preserved and the life of the individual saved.No special
dose can be prescribed: it should be administered until slight narcosis
is obtained and pain and vomiting cease.Small doses of morphine, given
hypodermically and quickly repeated, is the best plan of exhibiting it.It may be given by the stomach, but under such circumstances it is apt
to be rejected, or if retained absorption goes on slowly, or possibly
not at all.If for any reason its hypodermic use is impracticable, it
had better be given by the rectum.Opium lessens the danger of death
from collapse: it gives nature an opportunity to untwist the gut in
volvulus, or to unroll it in intussusception, or to cut off the
invaginated part by gangrene; and in internal hernia, morbid adhesions,
strangulation by bands of lymph, stricture, and other forms of
obstruction, it diminishes violent peristaltic action, postpones
inflammatory infiltration, fixation of the strangulated portion, and
keeps the parts in better condition for operative interference, which
in many cases offers the only hope of relief.To carry it farther than
slight narcosis and arrest of the most painful symptoms of obstruction
is an abuse of the remedy.By such abuse the symptoms will be masked
and both patient and practitioner deceived.When obstruction is due to fecal impaction or spasm, the opium
treatment is still often indicated.Not unfrequently, after pain and
vomiting are relieved and slight narcosis kept up for some hours, the
bowels relax and spontaneous evacuation takes place.If not, discharge
of the contents of the bowel should be assisted by the administration
of castor oil, calomel, or repeated enemata of warm water.These agents
should not be used, however, as long as there is pain, tenderness of
the belly, or any evidence of peritonitis, but the opium treatment
continued until all signs of inflammation have disappeared.It has been
proposed to give {864} belladonna in place of opium; in small doses and
carefully watched it may be added to the opium, but should not be
substituted for it.The local application of ice-water or pounded ice to the abdomen has
been recommended; and it is asserted that the danger of general
peritonitis is lessened, and that the strangulation itself has
disappeared, under the influence of cold.If, however, cold increases
pain and peristalsis, it should be abandoned.The local application of
moist heat or fomentations will more probably do good and give a
grateful sense of relief to the sufferer.General bleeding should never
be resorted to, and the use of leeches, except to ward off or subdue
some local inflammation, is of doubtful expediency.Blisters,
ointments, and cups are useless in such an emergency.Cracked ice,
strong coffee, and carbonated water in small quantities are valuable in
allaying thirst and nausea.Cases are reported where obstruction of the bowels has been overcome by
the use of electricity; both the continuous and induced currents, but
chiefly the former, have been used; its value in such cases is
improbable.Abdominal taxis or massage has been earnestly recommended and
frequently practised in cases of constriction.Successful results from
this procedure have been reported.It has been attempted while the
patient was in a warm bath or under chloroform or while taking large
enemata of warm water.Abdominal traction by the use of large cups to
the belly has also been advised.We can only hope for success from
these measures in the early stages of obstruction, before inflammatory
action or fixation of the strangulation has taken place, and any
attempt of this kind should be made with tact and gentleness.Inversion
of the body has also been suggested.The injection of large quantities of warm water into the bowels to
overcome obstruction should never be omitted before resorting to
operative interference.The author has seen this plan in five or six
instances succeed after all other means had failed.Simple warm water
should be used, introduced by means of the common Davidson or a
fountain syringe.The injection should be made slowly, with occasional
intervals of rest, to allow the fluid time to pass through the
intestinal coils.During the operation the patient should be in the
knee-elbow or Sims's left lateral position, and under the influence of
an anaesthetic.One or two gallons of water may be used.In place of
water, the bowel may be inflated with air, introduced by a pair of
common bellows to the nozzle of which a piece of India-rubber tubing is
attached.The addition of castor oil, turpentine, carbonic acid gas,
and other irritants will more likely detract from than add to the
efficacy of these measures.In chronic intussusception, or in acute
cases when fixation of invagination is believed to have taken place,
and especially when inflammation is great, gangrene threatening or in
existence, injections of air or water should not, of course, be
attempted.In invagination, when the intussuscepted part is low down in the rectum
or protruding from the anus, replacement by fingers or sound should be
tried; reduction begun in this way may be completed by injections of
air or water.The propriety of introducing the whole hand into the
rectum is very questionable.In occlusion of the gut by compression and
traction the cause should be found, and, if possible, removed.An
abdominal or pelvic tumor may be pushed out of the way of the
compressed bowel, a cyst punctured, a displaced womb replaced.{865} Great care should be taken to support the strength of the patient
by concentrated and nutritious food, and in the later stages by
stimulants.When the bowels are distended by gas an injection into the
rectum of ten grains of sulphate of quinia will often give marked
relief.It has been proposed to tap the distended gut with a fine trocar when
accumulation of gas is enormous, causing dyspnoea and great general
distress; temporary relief is often obtained by this plan, which is an
imitation of a common practice among veterinary surgeons.Something
more than temporary relief may, however, follow the tapping.In
twisting of the bowel, in internal strangulation by band or loop or
ring, and in some cases of invagination, the constriction is kept up by
the enormous gaseous distension.The obstruction is continued as much
by causes within as without the intestine.When tapped and the gas
drawn off, the bowel collapses, and may escape from its constriction
and return to its natural condition.Tapping is not always certain or
safe.The trocar or aspirating tube may pass between the convolutions
and no escape of gas take place, or it may be followed by fecal
extravasation into the peritoneal cavity.Notwithstanding the risk, the
plan is a valuable one, and in suitable cases should be resorted to.SURGICAL TREATMENT.--In cases of acute obstruction of the bowel from
bands of lymph, diverticula, internal hernia, slipping of a portion of
gut into some opening, or twisting, when the treatment suggested has
been tried and fails, laparotomy should be performed; that is, the
abdomen should be laid open, the cause of the obstruction searched for,
and, if possible, removed.In acute cases a few hours, at most one day,
may be spent in trying the medical means recommended.After that time,
if the patient is not relieved, the sooner laparotomy is resorted to
the better the chance to save life.Acute internal strangulation of the
bowel from these causes has the same symptoms, course, and termination
that acute external strangulated hernia has.It demands the same
treatment--removal of the cause of the constriction.Delay in
performing the operation in the former is as certain to be followed by
peritonitis, gangrene, and death as it is in the latter; and the
surgeon who hesitates to open the abdomen and attempt to remove the
constriction in a case of acute obstruction after a fair trial and
failure of medical measures, is as culpable as the one who delays the
operation of herniotomy for unrelieved strangulated hernia.In rare instances spontaneous self-reduction of external strangulated
hernia takes place; the cases are exceptional, and the fact is no
apology for postponing herniotomy.So in occasional instances acute
internal strangulation is spontaneously relieved; here too the cases
are exceptional, and the occurrence should be no excuse for delay in
laparotomy.To justify the operation it is not necessary that the
precise site and nature of the mechanical impediment should be
determined, although this can usually be done.It is only necessary to
know that the cause of the acute obstruction is not enteritis or
peritonitis, but a constriction mechanical in character, which no
medicine or manipulation or expectant treatment can relieve.When
diagnosis is clear and laparotomy is indicated to save or prolong life
in intestinal obstruction, the aid of the surgeon should at once be
invoked.Peritonitis beginning or in actual existence
makes abdominal section more dangerous and {866} lessens materially the
chances of recovery.To make the operation absolutely the last resort
when the bowel is injured beyond repair, when peritonitis is in full
progress, gangrene threatening, or the patient on the verge of
collapse, is a useless cruelty to the sufferer and his friends, and
only serves to bring surgery into disrepute.If the truth were known,
many of the cases of death following laparotomy should be ascribed not
to the fact that the knife was used, but to the fact that it was used
too late.In intussusception not relieved by medical means the propriety of
abdominal section is questionable.The subjects of this condition are
usually children.Dislodging the invaginated bowel is not always
practicable, and the opium or expectant treatment may end in
spontaneous cure by the bowel righting itself or by sloughing of the
intussuscepted part.It is doubtless true that many of the so-called
cures from the latter process subsequently die from contraction of the
cicatrix at the site of the separation of the slough.In 43 cases
collected by Ashhurst of laparotomy for invagination, 13 recovered and
30 died.The record is bad, and to some extent the heavy mortality is
due to the fact that the operation was put off too long--delayed in
acute cases until sloughing had taken place, and in chronic cases until
adhesion of the invaginated parts had occurred.Indeed, some of the
cases reported were moribund when the operation was undertaken.Recently many successful cases have been reported, and it is fair to
presume that the percentage of recoveries in the future will be greater
than they have been in the past.In acute intestinal obstruction due to bands, internal hernia,
volvulus, or the presence of foreign bodies, as gall-stones, there is
no question that laparotomy should be performed after other measures
for relief have been employed and failed.Death in such cases is
inevitable and imminent, and operative interference should not be
postponed until peritonitis has set in.After the abdominal cavity has
been opened the distended gut can easily be found and the fingers of
the operator carried on down until the site of the constriction is
reached and the cause of the obstruction discovered.If the
constriction is due to the presence of bands or adhesions, they should
be cut or broken up and the gut relieved.If an internal hernia is
found or a portion of bowel has slipped into some fissure or pocket, it
should be withdrawn and the parts restored to their natural position.If the cause of the obstruction is a volvulus, the bowel should be
untwisted.If a foreign body is felt impacted in the bowel and closing
it, unless it can be readily and without danger of lacerating the coats
of the gut pushed on by the fingers of the operator until it has passed
the ileo-caecal valve, the foreign body should be removed from the
bowel by an incision and the wound in the bowel afterward closed by
sutures.If the case is one of intussusception, the invaginated parts
should be pulled out: this is practicable where adhesions are absent or
slight, but if the adhesions are very firm, and it is impossible to
restore the parts to their natural position, the gut should be laid
open above the occlusion, the edges of the opening should be attached
to the margin of the external wound, and a fecal fistula established.If the case of acute obstruction be due to stricture of the small
intestine, which is exceedingly rare, the gut may be laid open, and the
patient recover with fecal fistula, or entorectomy or resection of the
diseased part of the gut be resorted to.The operation of entorectomy
has been recommended by many {867} surgeons, and a large proportion of
the cases reported recovered.In one case by Koeberle six and a half
feet of the gut were successfully excised.The following table by Ashhurst[12] shows the results of laparotomy.It
will be seen that in 230 cases 68 recovered:

[Footnote 12: _Surgery_, p.Enterotomy is an operation originally performed by Nelaton.It is done
by making an incision, preferably in the right groin, above the crest
of the ileum and parallel with Poupart's ligament.When the abdomen is
opened a coil of intestine is found and carefully stitched to the walls
of the incision.A very small opening is then made into the bowel, and
a fecal fistula established.Enterotomy is less dangerous than
laparotomy, as by it there is less interference with the peritoneum;
but no relief could be afforded by this procedure in cases of
intussusception or acute obstruction from bands, hernia, or volvulus.It is applicable to cases of intestinal constriction when the
obstruction is about the lower part of the small or upper part of the
large intestine.It may be resorted to as a palliative measure when
exact diagnosis as to the character and site of the obstruction is not
clear, the case being otherwise hopeless, or in cases of obstruction
where severe symptoms persist and death is near, and yet for any reason
laparotomy or colotomy is inapplicable; or it may be performed in cases
of contractions after failure of patient and persistent medical
treatment.Many successful cases of enterotomy have lately been
reported, and the operation has been earnestly advocated by Trousseau,
Maunders, Wagstaffe, Bryant, and others.In chronic constriction due to
stricture or other mechanical obstructions, malignant or otherwise, not
remediable by any medical measures, colotomy should be performed.By
this operation the colon is opened and an artificial anus established.The sigmoid flexure in the left lumbar region is the part selected for
the colotomy if the obstruction is situated in the gut below that
point.When the obstruction is higher up in the colon or its exact site
cannot be determined, the caecum in the right lumbar region is the part
chosen.In cases of obstruction from the mechanical pressure of tumors,
the possibility of relieving the compressed bowel by treating the
tumors should of course be considered before resorting to colotomy.John went to the bedroom.{868}

CANCER AND LARDACEOUS DEGENERATION OF THE INTESTINES.BY I. E. ATKINSON, M.D.The term cancer of the intestines is used here in a clinical sense to
designate new formations in the intestinal tract the tendency of which
is to destroy life, and has no reference to the histological characters
of the tumors, inasmuch as these are, during life, for the most part,
concealed from the eye of the pathologist.It so happens, however, that
in a histological as well as in a clinical sense the term is
appropriately applied to all but a very few of the malignant new
growths that develop in the parts under consideration, if we adopt, as
seems proper, the opinion of most modern pathologists, that cancer or
carcinoma should only include those tumors "consisting of cells of an
epithelial type, without any intercellular substance, grouped together
irregularly without the alveoli of a more or less dense fibroid
stroma."Carcinoma of the intestines appears either as cylindrical-cell cancer,
as scirrhus, or as gelatinous or colloid cancer.Scirrhous cancer of
the intestines may resemble in appearance and texture the ordinary
medullary cancer, degrees of hardness or of softness depending upon the
predominance of the stroma or of the cellular elements in the
constitution of the tumor.Rarely, and in a purely clinical sense,
cancer of the bowels may exist as a lympho-sarcoma in the small
intestine, and then through progression from the glands of the
mesentery or elsewhere.Primary intestinal sarcoma has, however, been
observed.Similarly, melano-sarcoma has been detected in the intestine
as secondary to this form of sarcoma, originating in the skin or in the
eye.Of the forms of carcinoma, cylinder-cell cancer is the most frequent.Carcinoma gelatinosum or colloid cancer is of great relative frequency,
but it is altogether probable that here, as elsewhere, this represents
a degenerative form of ordinary carcinoma.At all events, it is certain
that it may be detected in many cases where the essential changes
reveal the ordinary glandular or cylinder-cell variety.These forms of
cancer may affect the bowel primarily or secondarily by extension from
adjacent organs and textures, or by metastasis.Primary cancer occurs
most frequently, metastatic cancer with great rarity.The relative
frequency of the different forms of cancer is not definitely known.In
the article on carcinoma in the _Dictionnaire Encyclopedique des
Sciences medicales_ (xii.576, 577) cancer of the bowels is said to
constitute about 8 per centum of all carcinomatous new growths.Sibley[1] found that primary {869} carcinoma occurred in the alimentary
canal (exclusive of the mouth, tongue, and the annexed organs) in 6 per
centum of the cases collated by him.Tauchou's compilations of nine
thousand fatal cases of carcinoma show that intestinal cancer was
present in 4 per centum.[2] These computations include cancer of the
rectum.If statistics of cancer of the bowels exclusive of rectal
cancer were available, they would show, doubtless, a much smaller
proportion.[Footnote 1: _Medico-Chir.Transact._, xlii., 1859.][Footnote 2: Leube, _Ziemssen's Cyclop._, vii.Any portion of the intestinal tract is liable to be attacked by cancer,
though undoubtedly some parts of it with much greater frequency than
others.Kohler[3] reported that in thirty-four cases the cancer was
situated twenty-two times in the large intestine (the rectum excluded)
and twelve times in the small intestine (nine times in the duodenum).It is not unlikely that in the cases of duodenal cancer the new growth
extended from the pylorus.At all events, primary cancer is seated with
far greater frequency in the large intestine, and, not including the
rectum, usually in either the sigmoid flexure or the caecum.Grisolle[4] declares the large intestine to be four times more often
affected with cancer than the small intestine; that the sigmoid flexure
is attacked as often as all the rest of the colon taken together; and
that the caecum is still more often affected.Where the intestinal new
growth is secondary to carcinoma elsewhere, it is usually so by
extension from neighboring parts; thus, the ileum may become implicated
by contact with uterine cancer, etc., and cancer of the stomach, liver,
kidney, etc.[Footnote 3: _Ibid._, vii.[Footnote 4: _Pathologie int._, 1865, ii.]Cancer of the intestines usually begins after the middle period of
life, and apparently irrespective of sex.Nevertheless, young persons
are occasionally affected, and children sometimes develop malignant new
growths of the bowels (usually sarcomatous), either primarily, which is
rare, or secondarily, by extension from other parts.The influence of
heredity seems not to be well established.There can be no doubt that
chronic irritation may act as an exciting cause of cancer of the
bowels, as it may in cancer of other parts.It has been impossible to
recognize any specific influence from especial forms of irritation, and
it is not likely that such exist.Indeed, the etiological relations of
intestinal cancer remain exceedingly obscure.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Up to a certain period of development cancer of the
bowels will give no sign of its presence; indeed, cases have been
observed where, death having occurred from other causes, the existence
of the malady became apparent only at the necropsy.In all cases the
symptoms are, at first, of an indefinite character and very inconstant.Vague abdominal pains are experienced; these gradually tend to become
referable to a certain locality and to become associated with irregular
action of the bowels.Constipation, alternating with short intervals of
diarrhoea, supervenes, and a varying amount of meteorism is developed.These symptoms may be attended by the signs of failing nutrition.The
body gradually shows the effects of chronic imperfect assimilation, and
becomes emaciated.The complexion slowly assumes the peculiar hue of
chloasma cachecticorum.Long before this occurs, however, the cancerous
new formation usually becomes perceptible as a more or less distinct
abdominal tumor, movable or fixed, as the part affected permits of free
movement {870} or is bound down to the neighboring parts either by
normal attachments or by adhesions resulting from inflammatory
processes or from the extension of the cancerous growth.When the tumor
is movable, it is generally situated in the small intestine or
transverse colon or sigmoid flexure, the other portions of the
intestinal canal being comparatively fixed.It should be mentioned,
however, that portions of the intestines normally freely movable may
become adherent to contiguous parts, as the transverse colon, with the
gall-bladder, liver, stomach, spleen, etc.; the transverse colon
and small intestine, drawn down by the weight of the new growth, with
the pelvic organs, the bladder, uterus, uterine appendages, etc.; and
that, finally, different portions of the bowels may become involved in
one mass.When the duodenum is the portion implicated the tumor may escape
observation or may be indistinguishable from cancer of the pylorus.It
occasionally happens that no tumor can be discovered until the malady
is far advanced whatever part of the bowel is affected.In nearly all
cases, however, before very long the tumor will be detected wherever
situated, but it will often remain difficult, owing to its situation,
to arrive at exact conclusions as to its precise character.Usually, it
offers considerable resistance to the touch, but its features may
readily be obscured by the fecal accumulation that forms above the
constricted portion of the gut and by the gaseous distension of the
bowel.This tumor will be slightly painful to pressure, and the patient
will refer to it a spontaneous pain, usually of a dull aching,
sometimes of a stabbing, character.Percussion yields a sound of
muffled resonance, due to the tubular nature of the tumor.Cancerous
neoplasms of the bowel, and of the duodenum especially, are apt to be
associated with a distinct pulsation caused by the subjacent abdominal
aorta.This may readily be distinguished from aneurismal pulsation by
the absence of an expansile character, by the disappearance of the
impulse that may sometimes be observed when the patient is made to
kneel upon all fours, and by the occasional mobility of the cancerous
tumor.By extension and by inflammatory infiltration the tumor
frequently becomes converted into a conglomerate mass where all
determination of locality becomes conjectural.The tumor is, with very
rare exceptions, single.The symptoms that accompany the development of these growths depend
mostly upon their position in the alimentary tract.Pain alone seems
independent of this, but is at best a most uncertain concomitant.When
the duodenum is the part affected by extension from the pylorus, the
symptoms are indistinguishable from ordinary pyloric cancer.Even
primary cancer of this part may exactly simulate pyloric cancer.The
localized pain and tumor, the vomiting after meals, the frequent
presence of blood in the vomited matters, the progressive emaciation
from starvation, the absence of abdominal distension (a result of the
constriction of the gut at its upper extremity), the gastric
dilatation,--all combine to make the diagnosis difficult.Cancer of the duodenum in its descending part may be suspected when
signs of hepatic and pancreatic obstructive difficulties point to
implication of the ducts, through which are produced jaundice upon the
one hand, and evidences of imperfect pancreatic digestion, in the
presence of undigested fat in the stools, upon the other.In the lower
portions of the {871} intestines the cancer becomes more and more
associated with meteorism and fecal accumulations.Constipation becomes
steadily more obstinate, but there are occasional fluid evacuations
containing blood, pus, and mucus, often stinking abominably.When the
tumor is toward the end of the large intestine--in the sigmoid flexure,
for example--fluid discharges occur with very great frequency at times;
but these are scanty in amount and but slightly fecal in character.In
these cases one does not usually observe the compressed, ribbon-like
stools that are seen in rectal cancer.These symptoms may precede the
appearance of the tumor, when the diagnosis will be less readily made.The constipation will at first be more amenable to the use of
purgatives.(It is said to be due more to a loss of contractility of
the bowel than to the narrowing of its lumen.)Gradually these will
lose their efficacy, and finally complete obstruction of the lumen of
the gut is effected; in which event the symptoms of ileus will develop,
with cramps and vomiting, finally of a fecal character, and the fatal
issue quickly follow.Not unfrequently peritonitis is developed, and
may be of a chronic character or may destroy life within a day or two,
or the patient may die from exhaustion before the obstruction becomes
complete.It may happen that the integument will become involved in the malignant
process, or may become continuous with the tumor by adhesive
inflammation.In such cases an opening may be formed by suppuration, or
the lancet may secure the passage of feces through an artificial anus,
and temporary respite be obtained.Sometimes a sudden disappearance of
the symptoms of obstruction--a result due to the softening and breaking
down of the cancerous mass, restoring temporarily the integrity of the
intestinal tube--may give an unjustifiable hope to the patient; or the
same effect may follow the establishment of a communication, by
ulceration, between the bowel above the tumor and some portion nearer
to the anal orifice.The progress of the new growth soon annuls the
benefits thus gained.Not uncommonly, particles of the cancerous mass may become detached,
and, if diligently searched for, may be discovered in the feces.Microscopic examination may then definitely determine the nature of the
disease.It has been claimed that colloid cancer may be diagnosticated
in this manner even before the appearance of other symptoms.[5] Death
may be hastened by the occurrence of metastatic deposits in other and
vital organs.Oedema of the lower extremities (of the left extremity in
cancer of the sigmoid flexure) will often be observed as a result of
the interference of the cancerous mass with the return of blood from
the extremities by pressure upon the large veins.The combination of
pain, tumor, constipation, tympanitis, progressive wasting, and the
cachexia that sooner or later supervenes, stamps eventually most cases
with unmistakable characters.[Footnote 5: Charon and Ledegank, _Journ.lxviii., 1879, p.The duration of intestinal cancer may extend from several months to
one, rarely two, years, the latter age sometimes being attained by
colloid cancer, the most chronic and least malignant form.MORBID ANATOMY.--By far the most frequently encountered malignant new
growth of the bowel is carcinoma, in one or another of its forms.The
cylinder-cell epithelioma is probably the most common of {872} these,
and, as seen in the intestine, offers many naked-eye points of
resemblance with ordinary encephaloid carcinoma.It is soft, filled
with a milky juice, and may attain considerable size.The tumors appear
as discoid prominences of varying size and number.Later, these may
become fungoid and ulceration ensue.The growths early involve the
whole intestinal wall, and by their increase tend to obstruct the
passage of the intestinal contents.When ulcerated they present a
nodular, uneven surface, situated upon a thickened base consisting of
the infiltrated coats of the bowel.Villous prolongations (villous
cancer; the undestroyed connective-tissue stroma) may project into the
lumen of the bowel and give a peculiar tufted appearance to the part
implicated.One or more points may be invaded by cancerous growth, and
above each will be developed a dilatation of the gut (the result of
distension) containing uncertain quantities of fecal matter, upon the
removal of which the tumor will appear much smaller than it appeared
during life.Scirrhus usually implicates the gut in its entire circumference, so
that a high degree of constriction may result from a small amount of
cancerous infiltration.It begins as small nodules or plates upon the
mucous membrane.As commonly observed, the lumen of the intestine is
narrowed by an annular band of gristly hardness.All the coats of the
bowel, with the peritoneum, become involved, and frequently the
contiguous parts are included in the cancerous infiltration, forming an
undefinable mass through which the contracted channel of the bowel may
be traced, though often impervious to any but the smallest articles (a
crow-quill, for example).The surface of the gut is generally
ulcerated, irregular, and nodular.The walls of the ulcer are irregular
and infiltrated.It will sometimes happen that the autopsy reveals
permeability of the bowel where total obstruction prevailed during the
latter days of life.This may be probably accounted for by the
disappearance of the hyperaemia that doubtless existed during life and
caused more or less turgidness of the growth.Sometimes the
connective-tissue element is less predominant, and gives place to a
more or less luxuriant cell-development; in a word, scirrhous carcinoma
is replaced by soft or encephaloid cancer.This difference is simply
one of degree, but is associated with greater rapidity and extent of
growth.Ulceration is extensive, and one may here also often discover
the villous, tufted appearance of villous cancer, caused by the
fringe-like shreds of stroma entangling cellular elements not yet
detached from the mass.Colloid cancer, or carcinoma gelatinosum, may be associated with either
of the above-described forms as a degenerative form, or may,
apparently, develop as such from the beginning.It is a very frequent
variety of the malady.In 27 cases of intestinal cancer, colloid cancer
was present in 5, as reported by Lebert.It is most often observed in
the sigmoid flexure and caecum, as are the other forms of carcinoma.It
is composed of a considerable mass extending around the bowel.Ulceration is less often found here than in the other forms, nor is
there the same tendency to secondary infiltrations.By the unaided eye
an alveolar structure may be detected, and when the mass is extensive a
soft, jelly-like consistency is presented, together with "a bright,
honey-yellow color."Small deposits of the colloid matter may be seen
upon the surface.These have been described as resembling wheals of
urticaria or herpetic or eczematous {873} vesicles (Bristowe).The
glairy fluid of colloid carcinoma oozes from the cut surface of the
tumor, bathes it, and is to be found in the intestine.These different forms of cancer sooner or later invade neighboring
parts, as the peritoneum, mesenteric and retro-peritoneal glands, and
adjacent organs.On the other hand, the intestines may become invaded
by cancer of the peritoneum and other parts.It has even been observed,
reversing the usual order of things, as secondary to cancer of the
liver (Wilks and Moxon).Under these conditions the symptoms of
intestinal cancer will have been associated with those due to the
primary affection.Lympho-sarcoma will rarely be found as an extension
from the lymphatic glands and involving the small intestine.Melanotic
sarcoma may occur as metastatic from an original melano-sarcomatous
tumor of the skin or eyeball.DIAGNOSIS.--In its earlier stages it is impossible to recognize cancer
of the intestines.After its symptoms have become established they may
resemble those of several disorders.Cancer of the duodenum cannot be
distinguished from that of the pylorus unless evidences of pancreatic
or biliary disturbances indicate obstruction to the passage of the bile
and pancreatic secretions.Previous to the appearance of a tumor one
must often remain in doubt.The alternations of constipation and
diarrhoea, the signs of partial obstruction, the localized pain usually
present, the gradual wasting, will arouse suspicions of cancer, though
chronic inflammatory affections of the bowels may induce symptoms not
altogether unlike these.The presence of a tumor will supply the
additional evidence necessary for a definite diagnosis.It will be
necessary to exclude fecal enlargements of the bowels.The cancerous
tumor will be somewhat painful, hard, nodulated.A tumor due to fecal
accumulation may closely simulate it, and is, indeed, usually
associated with it.By manipulation the fecal mass may be moulded, and
even displaced, and by appropriate purgative treatment may be caused to
entirely disappear.Foreign bodies, mesenteric tumors, and other
abdominal enlargements may offer physical resemblances to intestinal
cancer, but their symptomatology is usually so different that doubt may
be easily dispelled.Syphilitic gummy infiltration, with resulting
stricture, is more apt to occur in the rectum than in other parts of
the alimentary tract.The presence of fragments of the new growths may sometimes be detected
in the stools, when microscopic examination will determine their
nature.With cylinder-cell epithelioma and glandular cancer this is not
common, but with colloid cancer much information may be gained by
examining the evacuations.According to Charon and Ledegank,[6] colloid
cancer of the intestine may be detected before symptoms develop, by the
presence of colloid matter in the feces.In the later stages, however,
the gelatinous change of all the histological elements may occasion
embarrassment, as at this stage the peculiarities of the cellular
structure will have been destroyed.et de Pharm._, lxviii., 1879.]PROGNOSIS.--Intestinal cancer always proves fatal.Death may result
from the debility resulting from the cancerous cachexia or from
intestinal occlusion or from peritonitis.The duration of the malady is
usually not long.It runs its course in from several months to one,
rarely to two, years.{874} TREATMENT.--Treatment must be directed to the alleviation of the
distress caused by the disease.When
the cancer is situated in the colon, especially in the sigmoid flexure,
the operation for artificial anus often affords great though temporary
relief.The diet should consist of such articles in the digestion of
which a large residue is not formed.Milk, eggs, soups, etc.should
compose the principal articles of food.Mild laxatives will be required
to secure the proper evacuation of the bowels, and to relieve pain and
discomfort opium is invaluable and should be freely used.When
obstruction is imminent nutrient enemata afford the most efficient
means of administering nourishment.Lardaceous Degeneration of the Intestines.SYNONYMS.--Albuminoid degeneration, Waxy degeneration, Amyloid
degeneration, etc.Lardaceous degeneration of the intestines is an affection of quite
frequent occurrence in those persons who are the subjects of a like
change elsewhere; for although it has been asserted that it may be
present as a primary affection, it almost always succeeds the same form
of degeneration in other organs.Since, for the most part, it only
makes itself manifest at an advanced stage of the disease, its
importance is usually masked by the grave constitutional condition of
the patient, whose vital forces are wellnigh exhausted by the already
advanced degenerations present elsewhere.The extensive implication of
other organs and tissues in the same degenerative process also creates
great obscurity in the symptomatology of intestinal lardaceous disease,
and is doubtless the cause of the existing dearth of definite knowledge
upon the subject.That the intestines are comparatively frequently involved in lardaceous
disease is shown by dead-house statistics.Thus, Charlewood Turner[7]
reported from the London Hospital that in 58 cases of lardaceous
disease the intestines were affected 10 times; and Goodhart[8] in 150
consecutive necropsies of lardaceous disease at Guy's Hospital reported
implication of the intestines 63 times.[Footnote 8: _Ibid._, p.Although the bowels do not become affected as early as several other
parts, they will almost certainly become involved should the patient's
life be prolonged; and in those cases where death is a direct result of
the degeneration the intestines share with the kidneys the chief
responsibility.It is not, however, until an advanced stage of
lardaceous degeneration that its presence in the alimentary canal is
revealed by symptoms; indeed, many cases do not, throughout life,
betray evidences of the pronounced alterations that are to be
discovered after death.Even in extreme cases there are no symptoms
that would, even with probability, be referred to lardaceous disease of
the bowels in the absence of the same degeneration in other organs and
parts.There are, then, no specific symptoms following lardaceous
degeneration of the bowels.Where the normal functions of the intestines can no longer be properly
performed in consequences of the changes that have taken place in them,
there results a moderate diarrhoea.At first the number of movements
{875} may not be increased; the evacuated matters are fluid and of a
greenish or pale color.Usually, little or no pain is experienced,
though at times and in certain individuals this may be severe and
colicky.The diarrhoea is not always steadily progressive, but may from
time to time disappear.With the progress of the disease it may become
more free and persistent, and in the later stages hemorrhage from the
bowels may be superadded.This may vary in amount, and where, as is
often the case, the stomach participates in the degeneration,
haematemesis may also appear.These hemorrhages may be insignificant,
or may at once assume alarming proportions, and even bring to an
unexpected termination the life of the individual.Already, at the
outset of the intestinal symptoms, the general health will have shown
evidences of profound alteration, but upon the supervention of the
diarrhoea more rapid progress will be observed, consequent upon the
increased nutritive disturbance.The use of remedies in temporarily
controlling this diarrhoea may prolong for months the life they are
powerless to save.So far as concerns the intestinal affection, there is no special
tendency toward febrile excitement.It must not be forgotten, however,
that acute inflammatory attacks of various tissues and organs
frequently arise in the course of lardaceous disease.Though there seems to be reason to believe that mild degrees of
lardaceous degeneration may sometimes be cured, especially when
dependent on syphilis, there is but little hope of arresting its
progress at the late stage when the bowels become implicated.Indeed,
when pronounced degeneration of the bowels takes place the disease is
usually nearing the end of its course; for it is a well-settled fact
that in this degeneration extensive implications of organs may occur
without markedly reducing the patient's general condition, so long as
the kidneys and intestines remain unaffected.The cause of death is
usually to be traced to these organs.Dickinson[9] found that in 35
cases where death was apparently due to renal lardaceous disorder, the
immediate result was brought about by diarrhoea in 13 cases.Presumably, in a large proportion of these lardaceous disease of the
bowel was present.[Footnote 9: _Diseases of Kidney_, Part ii., 1877, p.The degeneration usually affects the lower portion of the small and the
upper part of the large intestine.Occasionally it will be found to
have invaded the whole alimentary tract.As in lardaceous degeneration
generally, the process begins in the small arteries and capillaries and
veins, affecting primarily the arterial and venous muscular coats--not,
however, according to the latest authorities, the muscular fibres
themselves, but their perimysium and the cement substance, the
degeneration being one limited to the connective tissues.[10] In the
mildest cases only some of the small vessels of the mucous membrane are
involved, and no naked-eye changes can be detected.In more advanced
stages the mucous membrane is pale and shows evidence of catarrh.Thickening occurs, and as the process advances a peculiar appearance is
revealed which has been compared to that of wet wash-leather (Wilks).The iodine test now gives the mahogany- reaction of lardaceous
matter, with the tissues affected, or, if the methyl-aniline-violet
test of Cornil be employed, the lardaceous material will display a
red-violet color, while {876} normal structures will be tinged
blue-violet.It is said to be better to make the test near a Peyer's
patch, since the latter is seldom affected by the degeneration, and
brings out, by contrast, the surrounding lardaceous material.[11] This
distribution of the material cannot be considered as constant, however,
since Hayem found the patches of Peyer most frequently affected.[Footnote 10: Cohnheim, _Allgem.[Footnote 11: Wilks and Moxon, _Path.404; Kyber, _Virchow's
Archiv_, Bd.In more advanced stages the surface may become irregular from glandular
enlargement, and ulceration may occur.Microscopic examination shows
the lardaceous material in the vessels, and also in the stroma of the
mucous membrane and villi.[12] The epithelium is not involved.The
degeneration, at first confined to the mucous membrane, extends to the
submucous tissue, the proper muscular coat of the intestines being
often implicated--so far, at least, as concerns its connective tissue.In the more severe cases Hayem found the agminated and solitary glands
extensively involved.Fine branches from affected vessels penetrate to
the interior of the glands.In such cases the mesenteric glands will be
found implicated.The degeneration of the vessels running through the
gland structure causes disappearance of this substance by fatty
degeneration, and occasions a reticulated arrangement of the lardaceous
material, and, secondarily, ulceration.In a similar manner ulcers may
arise in any part of the affected tract.Finally, the lardaceous
material may involve the whole thickness of the gut.[Footnote 12: Eberth, _Virchow's Archiv_, 80, S.The diagnosis of lardaceous disease of the bowels can only be made with
certainty in the presence of pronounced albuminoid disease of other
parts in association with the symptoms of intestinal disorder.Inasmuch as the disorder invades the bowels only at a late stage of its
existence, the prognosis acquires additional gravity.It is probable
that advanced albuminoid disease is never cured; so much the more
hopeless is it when affecting this tract.If unchecked, the diarrhoea
rapidly saps the powers of life; if temporarily alleviated, the
approach of death is more gradual.Whatever attempts are to be made to cure the disease, they must be
through the general system, and are identical with those directed
toward the cure of lardaceous disease generally.Treatment directed to
the intestines must be palliative.The diarrhoea must be combated by
appropriate diet and the administration of such remedies as protect the
surface of the mucous membrane and control the intestinal movement.Bismuth subnitrate in large doses is therefore indicated.Various
astringents may be employed, while the use of opium often secures most
gratifying relief.Preparations
of the crude drug seem to answer better than its salts.The necessity
of keeping the gut free from undigestible matters that may irritate the
already badly-damaged mucous membrane is apparent.Patients with this
form of lardaceous degeneration usually show the cachexia resulting
from profound modifications of nutrition, and their intestinal symptoms
can only be regarded as links in a long pathological chain.Hemorrhage
will call for remedies that under ordinary circumstances are employed
to control bleeding from the bowels.{877}

DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.BY THOMAS G. MORTON, M.D., AND HENRY M. WETHERILL, M.D., PH.G.Diseases of the inferior and terminal portion of the large intestine
may be divided into primary and secondary--the former when the morbid
cause is local and independent of disease elsewhere, the latter when it
is consequent upon or incident to some other bodily affection.Among
the primary lesions may be classed congenital malformations, prolapse
of the rectum, hemorrhoids, and some varieties of new growths; also
diseases caused by local irritations, infection, or traumatism, such as
proctitis, ulceration, fissure, non-malignant stricture, chancroidal
invasion and primary syphilis, including obstruction of the bowel by
impacted feces and foreign bodies.Thread-worms and various cutaneous
eruptions about the anus may also be included among the causes of the
primary diseases of this portion of the alimentary canal.The secondary affections are quite numerous, and may be caused by
direct extension of disease from the colon, as in the dysentery
following typhoid fever, and follicular enteritis, or entero-colitis of
children; by contiguity, from diseases in neighboring organs--_e.g._
ischio-rectal abscess causing fistula--or by changes in the nervous or
vascular supply, such as is seen in spasmodic contraction, paralysis,
epidemic dysentery, cholera, and the action of certain remedies.The rectum, the third or terminal portion of the large intestine, has
no sharply-defined upper limits: it is usually understood to begin at
the sigmoid flexure, opposite the left sacro-iliac symphysis; it is
from six to eight inches in length and terminates in the anus.As the
sigmoid flexure is the narrowest portion of the colon, so the calibre
of the first part of the rectum is narrower than the portion below,
where it gradually becomes more commodious, and near the anus presents
a peculiar condition of the walls which gives it a capacity for
remarkable distension.The rectum, which is somewhat cone-shaped, in
its anatomical and pathological characters retains those of the large
intestine with slight variation.Upon the upper or first part of the
rectum the duplicature of the peritoneum is continued, forming the
meso-rectum, which invests the bowel, attaching it to the sacrum.Below
this the middle portion of the rectum (extending to the tip of the
coccyx) is attached to the sacrum by connective tissue only, but also
has a peritoneal investment on the upper portion of its anterior
surface.{878} The third or terminal part of the rectum, which is only an inch
and a half in length, and is entirely without peritoneal covering,
terminates at the anus.The circular and transverse muscular fibres,
mucous crypts, and appendages throughout the rectum are identical with
those above, except that the general muscular tunic is thicker; but the
longitudinal fibres are less distinctly aggregated into bands than in
the colon, being disposed in a more uniform manner, except that, like
the circular fibres, they are especially aggregated between the
sacculi.The fact that the meso-rectum limits the mobility of the upper
and more narrow part of the rectum has led some to locate a third
sphincter at this point, but the existence of such an organ has not
been generally admitted.Van Buren characterizes it as an organ which
"anatomy and physiology had been equally unsuccessful in assigning
either certainty of location or certainty of function."[1]

[Footnote 1: Kelsey, _Diseases of the Rectum and Anus_, New York, 1882,
p.The anus guards the outlet of the bowel by its double sphincter muscle,
which under normal circumstances affords voluntary control, within
certain limits, over defecation.The well-known peculiarity of the
vascular supply, a sort of erectile tissue being formed by the inferior
hemorrhoidal plexus and the passage of some of the efferent veins
through the sphincter muscle, by which they are subjected to pressure,
is very favorable to the development of certain forms of disease which
will be considered among the local disorders.As embryology has thrown
considerable light upon the pathology of morbid growths by
demonstrating relationships that were previously unsuspected, so a
consideration of the development of the lower portion of the intestinal
canal may lead to a better understanding of some of its diseases,
especially those which are symptomatic or secondary.In early foetal
life the third division of the primitive intestine, the pelvic portion,
terminates in a cloaca in common with the urachus; subsequently, about
the eighth week, a partition (the perineum) is formed which divides the
cavity into two portions, the uro-genital sinus and the anal cavity.In
the mean time, at an early period a depression occurs on the cutaneous
surface at the site of the anus, which deepens progressively until it
encounters the primitive intestine, with which it unites at the end of
the fourth week, and the continuity of the tube becomes established.It
therefore is seen that the rectum in its upper and middle portions is
derived from the internal and middle layers of the blastodermic
membrane, while its lower third, with the anus, like the buccal cavity,
is formed by the external and middle layers.In its diseases, then, the greater part of the rectum would seem to
naturally participate in those of the large intestine, to which it
structurally belongs, while its inferior portion and the anus would
partake more in the disorders of the general cutaneous system.This
peculiarity of development also explains the difference noticed in the
vascular supply.The rectal veins are usually divided, like the rectal
arteries, into three sets--superior, middle, and inferior.They are
arranged so as to form two distinct venous systems, the rectal
returning its blood through the inferior mesenteric veins into the
portal system, the anal terminating in the internal iliac.The first
system is made up of the superior hemorrhoidal, the second of the
remaining veins.The superior hemorrhoidal forms a venous plexus which surrounds the
{879} internal sphincter muscle; the inferior hemorrhoidal vein also
forms a plexus, but it is subcutaneous and principally below the
inferior border of the external sphincter.There are, however, a number of communicating branches passing along
the walls of the rectum from one plexus to the other.The internal
hemorrhoidal veins also communicate freely with the branches of the
internal iliac around the trigone of the urinary bladder by means of
small vessels, which pass through the prostate gland and seminal
vesicles.By this method of anastomosis some relief is afforded when
there is an obstruction in the portal circulation, which is such a
common cause of turgescence of these veins, often resulting in
permanent dilatation or hemorrhoids.At the lower part, or at the junction of the middle and lower third of
the rectum, the internal circular fibres of the muscular coat of the
intestine become quite numerous, forming what is called the internal
sphincter muscle; it is nearly an inch in breadth, and completely
surrounds the lowest part of the rectum.It is about an inch above the
margin of the anus; its muscular fibres are of the involuntary or
unstriped variety; in function it assists the external sphincter in
closing the anus and preventing the involuntary escape of the contents
of the bowel.The external sphincter lies directly under the skin and upon the
internal sphincter and the levator ani muscle; its fibres encircle the
anus: arising from the coccyx, they are inserted into the tendinous
centre of the perineum, joining the transversus perinaei, the levator
ani, and accelerator urinae muscles.The sphincter ani is constantly in
a state of tonic contraction, but the force of its contraction may be
voluntarily increased.In the skin and superficial fascia are found
minute branches of the pudic and small sciatic nerves; in the
ischio-rectal space the internal pudic nerve; crossing about the centre
are the inferior hemorrhoidal nerves, which are distributed to the anus
and the lower portion of the rectum; the perineal nerve is especially
distributed to the anterior part of the anus.Thus it is seen that the rectum and anus have vascular and nervous
supplies of considerable diversity and importance.The simplest form of congenital malformation in this region consists in
an anus of insufficient size for the natural demands of the system, but
in no other manner abnormal.The most frequent variety of imperforate
anus is where complete occlusion is effected by the common integument
or by two cutaneo-mucous flaps, which owing to defective development
remain united without forming a raphe or perceptible line of union.The
rectum is not involved, and when the child strains the contained
meconium causes bulging of the part, which disappears under slight
pressure, but reappears when again free.In other cases the occluding
tissue is very firm, dense, with a disposition to pucker or form rugae.The sphincter muscle is rarely perfect, and though an artificial anus
may be made, years may elapse before the child can control the
evacuation.In conjunction with an imperforate anus the colon may
terminate in a cul-de-sac, or it may communicate with the urethra, the
bladder, or the vagina.{880} An imperforate rectum has been known to discharge at the
umbilicus, upon the face, under the scapula, upon the penis or the
anterior part of the scrotum.Sometimes, though very rarely, a common
cloaca has been found, as in fowls, common to the rectum and to the
genito-urinary organs; and still more rarely the rectum has opened in
abnormal sites upon the perineum and upon the buttocks.The rectum may be entirely absent or
it may be incomplete, terminating at various distances from the anus.These malformations of the bowel may be associated with a perfect anus,
or with any of its imperforate forms, or with a fecal fistula.In
occlusion of the rectum the offending structure is in some cases a
hymen-like fold of mucous membrane, which, during straining, can be
recognized by the finger as a fluctuating protrusion; while in others
it consists of a mass of dense fibrous tissue which extends upward from
an inch to an inch and a half: in the former there is always found a
normal anus; in the latter there is either no trace of anus or one in a
more or less rudimentary state.In those cases where the rectum is
entirely absent the intestine terminates either in a cul-de-sac or a
fecal fistula; very rarely the rectum is replaced by a
fibro-ligamentous cord or band which springs from the colon, and,
descending toward the bladder, blends with the connective tissue of the
part.In the latter the pelvis is always in an imperfect state of
development, being much contracted in its lower diameters, and the anus
is absent; and Rokitansky and Curling lay stress upon the
non-development of the pelvis as a diagnostic guide in determining the
absence of the rectum.The passage of a sound into the bladder or
vagina is a procedure of some diagnostic value, as if its point
impinges directly against the sacrum it may be presumed that no rectum
exists.If the malformation is of such a character that the fecal
matter can find no exit, a train of symptoms ensues analogous to those
seen in the adult affected with intestinal obstruction: the infant
cries and is constantly restless, refuses food, vomits, the abdomen
distends, and death speedily ensues.A remarkable exception to this
rule was the case mentioned by Bodenhamer of a child with absence of
the rectum who was not operated on until three months after birth, and
who was apparently in perfect health.At the operation the intestine
was found three inches from the surface, and the child made a good
recovery.Although the statistics of this class of malformations are somewhat
contradictory and confusing, it is safe to state that more male than
female children are so afflicted.The prognosis in the large majority of these cases is grave, for unless
the operator can see or feel the fluctuating protrusion, or can
recognize it after a very slight exploratory incision, he is working
totally in the dark and in close proximity to the peritoneum.Hemorrhage, peritonitis, pelvic cellulitis, and septicaemia diminish
the chances for recovery.Indeed, the majority of these cases are
scarcely amenable to surgical treatment.{881} PRIMARY DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.Prolapse and Procidentia of Rectum and Anus.These conditions obtain most frequently at the two extremes of life,
infancy and senility, but have a very different causation in each.Prolapse of the bowel may be partial or complete--partial when a
portion of the mucous membrane is extruded, and complete when the
entire rectum appears outside the anal orifice.A predisposing cause in
infants is found in the mobility of the bowel--in the fact that it and
the sacrum are much less curved than in the adult, and the abdominal
viscera are more voluminous: this, associated with the undeveloped
state of the muscular system, causes the weight and strain to act
directly and forcibly upon the sphincters, and the extrusion takes
place.It is often excited by allowing children to sit for a length of
time upon the chamber-vessel.It is frequently caused among children by
the presence of vesical calculi, by Oxyuris vermicularis, diarrhoea,
constipation, dysentery, polypi, and by the long-continued acts of
coughing and crying.In adults and the aged it may be caused by loss of tone of the anus and
rectum in chronic diarrhoea and dysentery, or from the energetic action
of drastic cathartics, by urinary calculi, the long-continued use of
enemata, chronic cough, diarrhoea alternating with constipation,
stricture of the urethra, prostatic hypertrophy, tenesmus due to the
presence of polypi, and by the pressure of a pelvic tumor.It may
accompany procidentia uteri and hemorrhoids.An incomplete, reducible
prolapse consists of two or more overlapping plications of
normal-looking mucous membrane, sensitive but painless.In these cases
there is provoked a hyperplasia of much-elongated connective tissue in
the submucous space which undergoes serous infiltration and causes an
oedematous condition of the part.In a complete prolapse the entire
rectum--all of its component layers--is protruded through the anus.In
a recent case the folds of the gut are well marked, but in one where
the bowel has remained in this abnormal condition for some time the
submucous tissue becomes charged with inflammatory deposit which
effaces the plications and causes the bowel to become pale, hard, dry,
and tough; and finally pigmentation occurs and the part assumes
somewhat the character of true skin.These vary greatly in size, from
the slightest protrusion of mucous membrane to a tumor the size of a
melon.Usually they are reduced with ease, but their reappearance is
occasioned by the slightest tenesmus.In old age the soft parts of the floor of the pelvis and the anal
sphincters lose to a great extent their tone and contractile vigor, and
the rectum, also participating in this change, is often unable to
withstand the increased thrust of the diaphragm and the compression of
the abdominal muscles during defecation; which act frequently demands
more exertion on account of a tendency to constipation in advanced
life.In these long-standing cases of senile procidentia it is a matter of
experience, verified by post-mortem dissection, that the fibres of the
sphincters and of the levatores ani muscles are flattened, pale, and
stretched beyond the possibility of contraction, while the entire
perineum is in a state of atrophy.{882} Polypi of the Rectum.There are two varieties of these--the gelatinoid or soft, and the
fibroid or firm.The latter is of rare, the former of common,
occurrence, especially in children under the age of twelve years.The
fibroid polypus is only found in adults, and is composed of dense
connective-tissue elements and blood-vessels.The gelatinoid or soft
polypi are also partly composed of connective tissue and vessels, but
much finer than in the other: they contain hypertrophied follicles and
are covered with spherical epithelium.They resemble nasal polypi, but
are more dense.These growths are not malignant in character, but are
very troublesome, as they are almost always pedunculated, the stem
being from half an inch to four inches in length, which admits of the
descent of the tumor within the grasp of the sphincters during
defecation, and frequently admits of its escape from the anus.Their
presence is not free from danger, as they are very vascular, bleed
readily, and are sometimes detached by the breaking of the pedicle
during defecation.The presence of
these abnormal growths teases the rectum and brings on tenesmus and
frequent desire to go to stool; the feces are flattened, and with them
escapes a quantity of glairy red mucus which has been compared to thin
currant-jelly.When caught in the grasp of the sphincters they often
bleed profusely, and especially is this the case with children so
affected.The presence of these bodies is accompanied with a sense of
weight and uneasiness in the bowel.They may be single or multiple;
they may be round, reniform, oval, fusiform, or irregular; they may be
smooth or villous.In size they vary from that of a marble or cherry to
that of a small hen's egg, and they are usually found about three
inches above the anus, but they vary in position from a point just
within the sphincter to one six inches up the rectum.Their presence is
usually diagnosticated without difficulty, or, if any is experienced, a
digital exploration will reveal them.A child with functional
disturbances of the bowels accompanied with frequent hemorrhages should
be examined for polypus.One of these growths sometimes unpleasantly
complicates a case of hemorrhoids.A rectal polypus is an adenoma, consisting of dilated glands of
Lieberkuhn imbedded in connective tissue, also containing nerves and
blood-vessels, and is covered with the epithelium of the bowel.Hemorrhoids, or Piles.These are usually fibrous when situated below, or vascular when
situated above, the sphincter ani muscle.They are conveniently known
as external and internal piles, but in some instances it is impossible
to say whether these tumors are external or internal.In either variety
they are due to an abnormal state of the blood-vessels, and especially
of the plexus of superior, middle, and inferior hemorrhoidal veins
disposed around the lower extremity of the rectum immediately above the
internal sphincter muscle.The inferior mesenteric and internal iliac
veins receive a large portion of the blood from this plexus, so that a
very free intercommunication exists, around the lower portion of the
rectum, between the general {883} venous system and that of the liver.It should be borne in mind that these veins are destitute of valves,
and are situated in a very dependent part, which is normally in a high
degree of functional activity.External hemorrhoids are found at the very verge of the anus, and, when
not irritated or inflamed, appear like movable, dependent plications of
hypertrophied skin.They appear either singly or in groups, but it is
nothing unusual to find five or six of them together, and they are not
infrequently associated with the internal variety.These pendulous tabs
of integument are very prone to inflammation, and they then become
exquisitely tender, painful tumors, which vary in size from that of a
small pea to that of a pigeon's egg.That portion of the tumor
presenting toward the anus is covered with mucous membrane; the other
is covered with integument; the former is dark-, due to
engorgement of its vessels.These, being composed internally of
tortuous, dilated veins which have totally lost their normal
resiliency, bleed freely on section, but after a time they undergo the
following changes: the over-distended vein, of which each is mainly
composed, either becomes obliterated by the encroachment of
inflammatory deposit or its walls give way and the contained blood
escapes; its serum is absorbed, and the tumor now consists of a
blood-clot, the remains of a vessel, inflammatory lymph, a hyperplasia
of connective tissue, mucous membrane, and integument.It undergoes a
still further change by absorption, and remains a permanent pendulous
teat of cutaneous and connective tissue, bearing no trace of vascular
channels.On account of the extremely sensitive nature of the mucous membrane and
skin of the anus, an inflamed condition of these tumors entails an
amount of suffering very disproportionate to their size: there is
torture in the act of defecation, constant tenesmus, spasm of the
sphincters, a sense of weight and heat in the perineum, and sometimes a
swollen, very painful, condition of the raphe, which stands out like a
cord.Occasionally there is a total inability to urinate, combined with a
frequent desire to do so.When an attack such as this ends in
suppuration of the tumor a radical cure is effected, but a marginal
ulcer of the anus sometimes follows.An unclean and neglectful habit
provoking constipation, sexual incontinence, over-indulgence in
highly-seasoned food or in stimulating beverages, exposure to cold and
wet, and the straining attendant upon dysuria, will provoke an attack.No age or sex is exempt from this affection (Gross).It is claimed that
before puberty females are more subject to it than males; after that
age the reverse obtains, except during pregnancy.Internal hemorrhoids are round, oval, or sometimes cylindroid-shaped
tumors covered by mucous membrane; they are smooth, granular, or rough
to the touch, much less sensitive and painful than the inflamed
external variety, and are situated within the rectum it may be an inch
or two above the internal sphincter muscle.They occur in groups or
scattered over the surface of the bowel.In structure they are soft,
spongy, vascular tumors composed of dilated and tortuous blood-vessels,
the veins predominating over the arteries, their interstices scantily
supplied with connective tissue, and their covering is of mucous
membrane.In color they are dark red, but when compressed and
strangulated by the sphincters they assume a dusky purple hue.After
long exposure they take on a pseudo-cutaneous appearance.{884} The columns of the rectum are the seat of the cylindroid pile,
which is brighter in color and much more arterial in its structure than
the ordinary variety, and bleeds very freely.Anything which causes
stasis and accumulation of blood in the hemorrhoidal plexus of veins
predisposes to this very common affection.Constipation is the usual
cause; and among others may be named diseases of the liver which cause
portal obstruction, pelvic tumors causing engorgement from pressure,
the gravid uterus, labor, prostatic hypertrophy, urinary calculi,
stricture of the urethra, stricture of the rectum, and rectal tumors.Among other causes are horseback-riding, the erect posture, violent
cathartics, seat-worms, dysentery, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and a
sedentary life, with a diet of rich, stimulating food.These piles do not usually cause much suffering; they vary in size from
that of a pea to that of a pigeon's egg, and cause a sense of weight
and stuffing in the bowel; but when they are large and numerous they
cause severe pain, tenesmus, difficult defecation, spasm of the
sphincters, and prolapse of the anus.When the patient is at stool the
tumors are forced down and protrude in a bunch, surrounded and
constricted by a collar of prolapsed mucous membrane: under these
circumstances the tortuous and dilated vessels of which they are
composed give way and free arterio-venous hemorrhage takes place.In
some cases this happens at every stool, the patient losing from a few
ounces to a half pint of blood almost daily until alarmingly depleted.Usually, the protruded piles are easily restored after a motion of the
bowels, and so remain until the next one occurs; but in other cases of
longer standing and of more gravity the sphincter loses all tone and
the piles remain constantly prolapsed.This affection is very chronic,
and the subject of it has to regulate his life with the greatest care,
as the least unusual effort or excess may provoke an exacerbation.Excepting in the worst cases the general health is not materially
impaired.They occasionally become so strangulated as to slough off,
which effects a cure, but this is accompanied by grave constitutional
disturbance.The disease is rather rare before the age of puberty, but
is very common in both sexes in adult life, and is frequently
associated with fistula, polypus, fissure, or carcinoma of this region.In females suffering with piles a free hemorrhage from them sometimes
takes the place of the menstrual flow.The presence of internal piles
causes a sense of weight and fulness and the sensation of a foreign
body or of feces remaining in the rectum, with troublesome and
obstinate itching about the anus.These symptoms, with the occurrence
of hemorrhage from the rupture, erosion, ulceration, or abrasion of the
dilated vessels, render the diagnosis easy.Should the piles not
protrude, they can readily be made to do so by directing the patient to
sit and strain over a vessel containing hot water.If the piles do not
appear, a digital examination should be made.Indeed, it would be
better to make one in every case of this kind.About the margin of the anus the superficial veins are prone to great
dilatation, and when presenting form masses of a bluish color, often
very dark, covered partly by mucous membrane, partly by integument.{885} Dilatation of the Rectal Pouches, or Physick's Encysted Rectum.This is an uncommon disease, generally occurring in those advanced in
years, and consists of an hypertrophy, and sometimes of an
inflammation, of the natural rectal sacs.These pouches are quite small
in early life, and enlarge gradually as age advances, this condition
being favored by the lodgment in them of extraneous substances, such as
indurated fecal matter, inspissated mucus, the seeds of fruit, and
other undigested masses.Constipation, so usual with the old,
predisposes to this affection, as it keeps the bowel distended with
hardened feces.The pouches vary much in size, the largest of them
admitting the end of a finger.The disease is insidious and slow, but
is capable of producing intense suffering should inflammation,
suppuration, or ulceration attack them.Sometimes as many as a dozen
are involved.The symptoms, which are rather misleading than suggestive of the
disorder, are a sensation of weight and uneasiness just within the anus
and uneasy sensations in the rectum, distressing itching, and, after a
time, pain following defecation and lasting often for hours.The pain,
which is aching and burning in character, is not confined to the parts
affected, but radiates down the thighs, toward the back, and into the
perineum.An increased secretion of mucus always exists in these cases,
but the discharge of purulent matter is uncommon, and its presence
indicates the existence of very active inflammation.It is said that even in the worst cases no spasm of the sphincters
occurs.An exploration of the bowel with a blunt-pointed hook affords
the only reliable guide to correct diagnosis: this, as it is moved
about in the rectum, engages the rim of a sac, which may thus be drawn
down through the anus and examined.Non-malignant Stricture of the Rectum.In the absence of ulceration or syphilitic infection this is an
uncommon disease, and very many of the cases of so-called stricture of
the rectum are caused by spasm which always disappears during
anaesthesia.The affection may be described as a narrowing of the lumen of the
rectum, more or less circumscribed, by the deposition of inflammatory
lymph or fibrous tissue in the mucous, submucous, or muscular tunic of
the bowel.It may be due to traumatic causes, such as the introduction
of foreign bodies, the frequent and careless use of enema-pipes, or the
presence of sharp or irritating substances swallowed, as pieces of
shell or bone.It is said to have been caused by indurated feces, but
no cases have been published in which this causation is clearly shown.This condition has also been brought about by various operations upon
the mucous coat of the bowel, such as the application of nitric acid
and other escharotics and the removal of portions of mucous membrane
and of hemorrhoids.Stricture may be secondary and a result of extension of an inflammation
outside the bowel, as pelvic cellulitis; and it is frequently caused by
syphilitic deposition and by chancroidal invasion--in the former by
{886} infiltration, ulceration, and cicatrization, in the latter by
unnatural sexual connection, or by infecting vaginal discharge running
into the bowel.When the stricture involves only the mucous tunic, it imparts to the
finger the sensation of a ring-like elevation or a valve-like
projection, into which the finger enters or beyond which it passes
usually without much difficulty; but when it involves the submucous and
muscular layers, as after the cicatrization of a large rectal ulcer,
the finger encounters a dense fibrous mass which in some cases appears
to have no lumen, but in others will admit only the end of the finger.In these grave cases of long standing there occurs considerable
dilatation of the rectum above the stricture due to fecal detention and
impaction at this point, and hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the
bowel produced by long-continued straining and expulsive efforts.Allingham[2] speaks of chronic constipation as a cause, and says,
"Straining to evacuate the contents of the bowel forces down the upper
part of the rectum into the lower, causing an intussusception; it gets
within the grasp of the sphincter muscles, and this may be the
starting-point of the irritation."Stricture does not usually follow
proctitis, even when the latter is very chronic.The long-continued
pressure of the child's head in cases of delayed labor is said to have
caused stricture of the rectum.[Footnote 2: _Diseases of the Rectum_, p.This affection is a disease of adult life, and more cases of it occur
among women than among men."If stricture of the rectum is found in a
young woman, it is probably due to chancre cicatrices; if it is met
with in old women and men, the inference should be that it is either
caused by cancer or by syphilitic infiltration and its consequences.Only in those cases in which no cicatricial tissue has been
formed--that is, when the contraction is due to the infiltration
alone--will the results of the antisyphilitic treatment contribute
anything toward rendering the diagnosis more certain."Stricture of the bowel may exist for months and years without being
recognized and without causing the patient much uneasiness; more
frequently, however, there is marked uneasiness, with an increased
desire to go to stool and a sense of weight or of a foreign body in the
bowel.It is given usually as
one of the most common and reliable symptoms of this condition that the
feces are flattened, ribbon-shaped, or triangular or wire-drawn: in
true stricture, according to Allingham, this is not the case, but the
characteristic stool consists of small, irregular, broken fecal
fragments.When the contents of the bowel happen to be watery, the
loose stool is spurted out with great force.In this disease diarrhoea
alternates with constipation; the intestines become distended with
quantities of gas and feces, which provoke frequent and severe attacks
of colic; the appetite and digestion fail; the complexion becomes
sallow; the patient emaciates; ulceration sets in, and the patient
slowly sinks from exhaustion.Usually, these cases do not give rise to
much pain, and what there is, is usually referred to the back, thighs,
penis, or perineum.A discharge of mucus resembling white of egg
immediately precedes each action of the bowels.Usually, these
strictures are within two and a half or three inches of the anus, but
sometimes they have been found high up in the sigmoid flexure, and
rarely at a greater distance.A syphilitic stricture by direct
inoculation {887} is found just within the sphincter muscle, and
consists of an infiltration of inflammatory lymph in a circumscribed
portion of the submucous tissue.It is tight, highly sensitive,
thickened, inflamed, and bathed in pus; there are also constitutional
symptoms, as fever, anorexia, and mental irritability.The subjects of
this variety are usually women.The tissues composing strictures of the
rectum of a very chronic character are found to be gray or bluish-white
in color, of very dense fibrous structure, and creaking under the knife
when cut, as a piece of cork would do.Besides the before-mentioned stricture, due to the contraction of a
chancroidal ulcer, is another caused by submucous gummata of the
ano-rectal region, which is very rare; and yet another, the diffuse
gumma, or ano-syphiloma of Fournier, which is the most frequent of all
causes of stricture of the rectum.The diffuse gumma is one of the
later manifestations of syphilis, and consists in "an infiltration of
the ano-rectal walls by a neoplasm of as yet undetermined structure
originally, but susceptible of degenerating into a retractile fibrous
tissue, and thus giving rise to narrowing of the intestinal calibre to
a greater or less extent."Proctitis, or Inflammation of the Rectum.Inflammation and suppuration in the lower part of the rectum are even
more common than the corresponding affections of the caecum, and their
causes are quite as various.In many cases, no doubt, this affection is
traceable to ulceration (perforative or otherwise) of the mucous
membrane; in others it probably originates in the connective tissue
which surrounds the rectum (periproctitis).The rectum, still more
frequently than the caecum, becomes involved in inflammation and
suppuration originating in the various pelvic, and even in distant,
organs.Abscesses arising in the abdominal cavity or its parietes are
peculiarly apt to gravitate into the pelvis and to communicate with the
rectum.Proctitis in its acute form has some symptoms in common with dysentery,
but it differs from it by the absence of abdominal pain, tenderness,
and severe constitutional symptoms.The pain in proctitis is usually
referred to the sacrum and perineum, and there is frequently dysuria
from sympathetic affection of the bladder.This disease may be acute or
chronic; the latter form occurs in those advanced in life.Frequent
attempts to evacuate the bowels, with great tenesmus, heat, weight, and
fulness in the bowel, and a mucous and bloody discharge in the absence
of impaction of the rectum, characterize the attack.Should it be
protracted and severe, the discharge will become purulent.A digital
exploration should always be made to ascertain if any foreign or
irritating substance is exciting the inflammation.The presence in large numbers of Oxyuris vermicularis may excite
irritation and inflammation of the rectal mucous membrane, which is
sometimes very intense.[3]

[Footnote 3: Curschmann, _Ziem.Inflammation of the anus and buttocks, caused by the application of the
leaves of Rhus toxicodendron after defecation, has extended into the
{888} rectum and produced proctitis and peritonitis.[4] "In some cases
of dysentery the pathological lesions are limited to the rectum, which
would produce an apparently local inflammation very similar to
proctitis.The irritation of unnatural sexual intercourse and the
contact of gonorrhoeal poison have been known to excite intense
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the rectum, with a copious
discharge of pure pus, and accompanied by intense burning pain and
great heat of the parts involved."[5]

[Footnote 4: Case of Dunmire, _Philada.[Footnote 5: Heubner, _Ziemssen's Cyclopaed._, vol.Fissure of the Anus and Rectum.The painful ulcer of Allingham is quite a common affection, attacking
women more frequently than men, and no age is exempt from it.Of 4000
consecutive cases of rectal and anal disease observed by Allingham, 446
presented fissure of the rectum.Their usual
position is dorsal, although they may be found at any part of the
circumference of the anus, and just within the verge of the anus at the
junction of the skin and mucous membrane, extending upward toward the
rectum usually not more than half an inch, and appearing as a crack or
fissure, often very trifling in appearance, or a club-shaped
ulceration, the floor of which will be very red and inflamed if it is
recent, but if chronic the floor will be grayish, with hard,
well-defined margins.Sometimes there will be found at the external
extremity of the fissure a small club-shaped papilla or muco-cutaneous
polypoid growth; but this is not to be confounded with the ordinary
polypus, nor is it the cause of the fissure, but the result of
irritation caused by the latter.In other cases the external site of
the fissure is indicated by a very tender and swollen flap of
integument, which often becomes the seat of a small but very painful
fistula.The club-shaped papilla is said to indicate invariably the
existence of fissure.Fissure of the rectum is often associated with anteversion and
retroflexion of the womb.In many of these cases the fissure will heal
spontaneously when the malposition is rectified.However treated, the
result will not be satisfactory while the uterine trouble remains
uncorrected.Fissure is not infrequently caused by and accompanied with polypi: it
may be caused by any accident whereby the verge of the anus is torn or
superficially lacerated--by chronic diarrhoea, by violent expulsive,
straining efforts, as in labor, by the passage of very hard, dry
stools--and very frequently it is syphilitic in origin.The most
prominent symptom of this disease is pain, and this is very severe and
peculiar in character, coming on in most cases not during the act of
defecation, but twenty minutes to half an hour afterward, and is
preceded by a hot, burning, throbbing sensation at the anus: then comes
on spasmodic contraction of the sphincters, and the patient endures
agonizing pain, often for several hours, when relief is gradually
experienced, and no pain is felt until defecation again becomes
necessary.Now, it has been observed that in some cases where the local
lesion is very trifling the pain and spasm are intense and
long-continued; in other cases, where spasm and agonizing {889} pain
followed every act of defecation, no lesion of the anus or rectum could
be found.This led Dolbeau to consider the essence of fissure of the
anus neuralgic, and to define it as "a spasmodic neuralgia of the anus
with or without fissure."The mental depression is so much out of
proportion to the local disease that this may come within Curling's
observation, that "mental causes may produce local disease in the
rectum."Rodent, or Lupoid, Ulcer of the Rectum.This is, fortunately, a rare disease, and is peculiar and distinct from
any other form of ulceration in this region.It is not cancerous,
although bearing some resemblance to epithelioma.As it first appears
it is very like a syphilitic sore, and its situation and the character
of the pain might lead to the supposition that fissure existed.Rodent
ulcer is usually situated upon the mucous membrane, although it
occasionally invades the integument about the anus; its shape is
irregular, its edges sharp and well defined, and it does not undermine
the neighboring tissues.There is no induration about this sore, as
nature does not seem to attempt to limit it or to set up any reparative
action, and its surface is red and dry.It is very destructive, and seems to prefer mucous
membrane, although sometimes it destroys deeply.It does not cause
infiltration; it does not spread by the lymphatic system, forms no
secondary deposits, nor does it produce stricture.It may remain in a
quiescent state for some time, and a certain amount of cicatricial
tissue may form; but it never heals spontaneously, and an exacerbation
comes on which destroys in a very few hours the repair which may have
been the work of many days.This form of ulceration of the rectum is
usually considered incurable; the pain is intense, being compared to
that produced by hot iron, and of course being much aggravated by the
acts of defecation.Patients so affected die from exhaustion and pain,
although recovery may take place, I have known one case entirely cured
by complete excision.Spasm of the sphincters is a usual accompaniment,
and greatly augments the suffering of the patient.Of the four thousand
consecutive cases of rectal disease tabulated by Allingham, only two
were cases of rodent ulcer.This condition may be caused by foreign bodies introduced into the
anus, by indigestible substances swallowed, by impaction of feces, by
pressure of tumors external to the rectum, and by intestinal
concretions.Any condition which causes loss of muscular and nervous
tone in the large intestine favors its obstruction; thus, it is not
uncommon in the aged of both sexes, but especially is this the case in
women, and in them it often follows parturition.Hysterical, nervous,
and debilitated persons are particularly prone to it.The insane, if
not carefully watched and regulated, will become the subjects of it.Impaction of feces is a very common cause of obstruction of the rectum,
and atony of this organ is usually the primary cause, the feces in
these cases being {890} either very hard and dry or clayey and
tenacious.These masses are of a more or less globular shape, and, as
they irritate the bowel and produce diarrhoea, the practitioner
sometimes falls into the error of prescribing doses of opium and the
astringents, misled by the appearance of feculent fluid which oozes
around the impacting mass.The impaction occurs just above the internal
sphincter.Habitual constipation soon stretches the rectum and robs it
of expulsive force, and an accumulation of months of fecal matter is
sometimes found.The appearance of persons so affected suggests
malignant disease: they are cachectic, sallow, dyspeptic, irritable,
and nervous.Vomiting, anorexia, thirst, cough, hectic, irregular and
profuse sweating, are also among its symptoms.Cases of melancholia and
of hypochondriasis have been cured simply by the discovery and removal
of rectal impactions.This condition has been mistaken for cancer,
phthisis, intermittent fever, and enlarged mesenteric glands.Accompanying impaction, and as a result, is spasmodic contraction of
the sphincter ani, which causes the anus to protrude in a nipple shape
and to firmly resist the introduction of the finger.Usually, there is
no discharge from the anus in these cases.Tenesmus, a sense of weight
and of a body present in the bowel, are experienced.Young people are
not often subjects of impaction.Concretions also cause obstruction of the rectum: these are more
frequently cylindroid in shape, and sometimes have a nucleus consisting
of some firm foreign body.Wetherill reports a case of a young adult,
who had been accustomed to the daily ingestion of a substance known as
hygienic bread (this substance is made from the husks of grain, and is
very coarse: it is used to excite peristaltic action), from whose
rectum he removed a very hard ball of this substance which was covered
with mucus, but which contained no nucleus.He reports another case in
which the offending substance was a globular mass of casein, stained
with bile and covered with mucus, and which had for a nucleus a small
mass of hardened fecal matter.Gueneau de Mussy[6] reports a case in which there was an occlusion of
the rectum by a mass of magnesia, which was so firmly impacted that it
had to be removed by a mallet and chisel.A similar case occurred in
the practice of Dunlap of Norristown.Fendick[7] relates an instance of
impaction by a fish-bone near the anus, causing obstruction requiring
surgical interference; which illustrates the importance of examining
carefully all cases of acute piles and threatened abscess.[Footnote 6: _Medical Times and Gazette_, 1879, vol.[Footnote 7: _Lancet_, 1880, vol.These concretions often consist of animal and vegetable fibres matted
together about a nucleus, the latter consisting of the seeds of fruit,
fragments of bone or gristle, hair, small coins, or pins."Enteroliths
may lodge in the rectal ampullae" and cause obstruction.Indigestible
substances swallowed with the food may be arrested in the rectum, such
as grape-skins, fruit-pits, husks, and fibres, and where there already
exists stenosis of the bowel a dangerous form of obstruction may be
produced.Jones[8] reports a case of chronic impaction of the rectum by
plum-stones, which gave rise to trouble in defecation, and at the end
of eighteen months produced symptoms of piles; at the end of two years
impaction occurred, and the mass was removed by the surgeon.Hazelhurst
relates {891} a case of impaction in a <DW64> where two hundred and
eighty plum-stones were removed from the rectum after having been there
for a week.The records of the Pennsylvania Hospital furnish the
following interesting case of obstruction:[9] "The patient (a male)
stated that twenty years before he swallowed a peach-stone.Two years
afterward he had symptoms of rectal irritation, tenesmus, constipation
alternating with diarrhoea, and liquid stools, etc.A digital
examination revealed a hard, stony mass two and a half inches above the
anus.Under ether Morton divided the external sphincter, and with a
pair of bone-forceps removed, with considerable difficulty, a
good-sized peach-stone which was lodged in the rectal tissues.The
stone was very sharp at the ends, and had evidently lodged crosswise
and become imbedded.The patient was discharged quite well and free
from all symptoms."[Footnote 8: _Lancet_, 1856, vol.[Footnote 9: _Surgery in the Pennsylvania Hospital_, Phila., 1880, p.Gall-stones may cause impaction or they may form the nuclei of
concretions.A case of impaction is related by Walker,[10] who removed
a gall-stone from the rectum which measured three and a half inches in
its longest and one and a quarter inches in its shortest diameter; also
one by Roberts,[11] in which he removed a gall-stone measuring five
inches in circumference from the rectum of a woman two weeks after
confinement.Mischievous, revengeful, insane, or intoxicated persons
sometimes force very curious foreign bodies into the rectum, among
which may be mentioned hot iron, bottles, cups, bougies, pieces of
wood, stones, a champagne flask, a goblet, slate-pencils, and the tail
of a pig with the bristles cut short.Some foreign bodies introduced
from below find their way through the sigmoid flexure and lodge in the
colon, or they may remain for a long time in the rectum.The caecum is
the favorite resting-place of foreign bodies.Turgis[12] removed by
linear rectotomy a cup which had been forced into the bowel.These
foreign substances, if not promptly removed, set up violent
inflammation.Obstruction of the rectum may be caused by vast numbers
of round- or thread-worms twining themselves together in a mass; and
when this happens in children or in adults of very nervous organization
a curious train of reflex symptoms may be developed, among which may be
mentioned choreic movements, convulsions, pruritus ani, insomnia,
irritability, melancholia, and hypochondriasis.Finally, the rectum may
be obstructed mechanically by pressure exerted from without.Such an
effect might be produced by morbid growths from the sacrum or ileum; by
deposits in Douglas' cul-de-sac; by ovarian disease; by pelvic
cellulitis causing stricture of the rectum; by vesical trouble; by
ascites with hepatic disease; and by various abnormalities of the
uterus, such as inflammation, morbid growths within or upon, simple
retroversion or retroflexion, or retroflexion of this organ in a gravid
state.[Footnote 10: Flint, _Prac.[Footnote 12: _Societe de Chirug._, 1878.]Impaction of feces under some circumstances may give rise to extensive
sphacelus of the rectum and the contiguous parts from pressure.This is
well illustrated in the following case of a woman aged sixty-five, who
was found to have an immense distension of the abdomen from ascites,
incident to a large omental scirrhus.The patient suffered greatly from
the pressure caused by the accumulation of water, and she was tapped.Soon after this an impaction of feces was observed, which probably had
been forming {892} for some time prior to her coming under observation.A week or ten days after the tapping the impaction was detected, but
not soon enough to prevent the formation of a large slough of the
posterior and inferior part of the rectum immediately above the anus.The submucous tissues and the skin, owing to the greatly enfeebled
condition of the patient, soon gave way, leaving a large opening which
communicated with the bowel.The tissues adjacent were oedematous, red,
and painful.The finger carried into the bowel through the anus
discovered the slough to have involved a region of at least two and a
half inches in diameter.Cutaneous Eruptions and Parasitic Conditions of the Anus.These are quite numerous, and they almost invariably produce much
distress and excite painful pruritus, which is augmented rather than
relieved by scratching or friction of any sort.The application of the
leaves of Rhus toxicodendron after defecation is capable of exciting
considerable inflammation upon and around the anus, accompanied by
small pearly vesicles, which, when ruptured by scratching, seem to
spread the disease wherever the contained serum flows.Eczema, when
found in the anal region, is usually due to parasitic growth.Erythema
intertrigo is caused by the friction of moist opposing surfaces, as
between the nates of stout persons, who perspire freely, and infants.The abraded derma exudes a sero-purulent fluid which excites
troublesome pruritus.When this condition exists about the anus it
causes painful defecation and spasm of the sphincters.Erythema
chronicum occurring in this locality is frequently a sequel to chronic
eczema and chronic lichen: the skin cracks, is moist, thickens, and the
epidermis exfoliates.The proximate cause in both of these conditions
is congestion of the vascular rete of the derma.In prurigo podicis
papules appear which itch intensely, and when scratched bleed, the
summit of each papule bearing a small black scab.If not cured, in time
a true psoriasis may develop.Herpes of the anus occurs similar to
herpes at the other mucous outlets of the body, and is usually
symptomatic of slight disorder of digestion.Wetherill has seen a case
of herpes zoster, (var.proserpens,) in which the vesicles extended
from the side of the scrotum along the perineum to the verge of the
anus.This condition was accompanied with neuralgia of the rectum,
painful defecation, and spasm of the sphincters.Furunculi sometimes
form at the verge of the anus, causing spasm, pain at stool, and
occasionally marginal fistulae.Various syphilodermata also appear in
this region.Gross was the first to describe a condition of trichiasis
of the anus--a very irritating complication to fissure--due to a
perverted recurvation of the hairs usually found in the anal region.Villerme states that hairs have been found growing from the mucous
membrane of the rectum.The colonization of pediculus pubis about the
anus occasions a certain amount of irritation.Sarcoptes hominis is
sometimes found in this region, having been carried there by hands
infested with this parasite.The
peculiar tracks or burrows made by this little animal, and the use of
the microscope, make the diagnosis certain.The Acarus autumnalis, or
mower's mite, has been found in the skin of this part, and it is
capable of causing great distress.These do not furrow the {893}
integument longitudinally, but burrow vertically, and may be picked out
of the summits of the wheals, where they appear as small red points.Ulceration of the Rectum and Anus.This is a condition very different from fissure or the painful ulcer of
Allingham--much more grave, difficult to treat, and, in chronic cases,
much less hopeful of cure.It is not an uncommon affection, Allingham's
table of 4000 consecutive cases of diseases of the rectum and anus
furnishing 190 of the disease under consideration.An ulcer of the
rectum may be partly within, partly without, the internal sphincter,
but in most instances is found above that muscle, from an inch and a
half to two inches from the anus, situated dorsally.The symptoms are unfortunately obscure and insidious, misleading not
only the patient, but also too frequently his medical adviser, and
gaining grave headway before a correct diagnosis is reached.Often the
very first symptom is a slight diarrhoea every morning as soon as the
patient rises, accompanied with a little discharge resembling
coffee-grounds; or, again, the discharge is like the white of an egg;
in some rare instances pus is formed.At this stage there is little or
no pain, but the patient suffers from tenesmus--which is not followed
by relief--and a sense of uneasiness in the part.Several stools of
this nature or streaked with blood may be passed during the earlier
part of the day, after which the patient feels partly relieved, and no
more evacuations occur until the following morning, when he again
experiences the same train of symptoms; and this repeats itself daily
for a long time.Finally, these discharges occur in the evening as well
as in the morning, then at various times during the day: his general
health begins to give way; the discharge becomes augmented in amount
and contains more blood and pus; and he suffers occasional pain from
flatulent distension.Local pain in the rectum is now felt, which is
not acute, but is very wearying, is augmented by much walking or by
long standing, and which has been described as similar to a dull
toothache.These ulcers may be multiple, and not infrequently lead to
stricture of the rectum, which condition is indicated by the
alternation of attacks of diarrhoea and constipation.As the ulcerative
process proceeds, nature makes efforts to limit the process, which
causes infiltration and thickening of the submucous and muscular
tissues, and produces narrowing of the lumen of the intestine, which in
time loses its tone and contractile power and becomes a passive tube,
utterly unfit to perform its normal duties.The sphincters give way and
the patient loses control over his evacuations.Finally, abscesses
form, which, burrowing toward the surface, form fistulae, and may
perforate the bladder, the vagina, or the peritoneal cavity.If one of
these ulcers be examined while yet in the acute stage, it will be found
to be oval in shape, with well-defined edges: the base will be either
grayish or very red and inflamed, the surrounding mucous membrane
appearing normal.The rectal glands will be found to be enlarged.Should the ulcer be examined at a later stage, it will be found to be
much deeper and more extensive, with great thickening and nodulation of
the mucous membrane, and looking in places as though the latter {894}
had been torn off.At this stage the ulceration may be partial or may
involve the entire lower portion of the rectum.The suffering is now
intense, and a constant discharge of fetid pus and mucus takes place.The appearance of the anus at this time suggests malignant disease: it
is covered with swollen, shiny, tender, club-shaped flaps of integument
constantly bathed in an ichorous discharge.The entire rectum and
sigmoid flexure have been involved in some cases, while in others
necrosis of the sacrum has occurred.Patients suffering from ulceration
and stricture are very liable to a low form of peritonitis, attended by
intense abdominal pain.The causation of these ulcers of the rectum is frequently very obscure:
some are of syphilitic, others of strumous, origin.Some are of
traumatic origin, but more often the patient was in apparent health up
to the time of the appearance of the disease.The experience of
Allingham would indicate that neither chronic constipation nor
dysentery is a frequent forerunner of this malady.T. Claye Shaw,[13]
in an article entitled "On Some Intestinal Lesions of the Insane,"
says: "After death are found patches of ulceration sometimes so
extensive as to resemble a honeycomb network.The edges are usually
slightly raised, and perhaps hardened; but the ulcers are at other
times mere local punchings out of the mucous membrane, and there is
often a little loose gelatinous material."It is claimed that such
disorders are not infrequent among the insane.Bartholomew's Hospital Reports_, 1880.]It is also claimed that the chronic mechanical irritation from foreign
bodies, impacted feces, and the like exert a causative influence in the
formation of ulcer of the rectum.Like typhlitis, this affection leads
to chronic inflammatory changes in the immediate neighborhood
(periproctitis), with the formation of fistulae and crater-shaped
ulcerations, and to the extensive destruction of the mucous membrane,
followed by wasting and contraction of the rectum.The healing of these
ulcers is much delayed by the fact that the ulcerated and undermined
mucous membrane is irritated by the fecal masses which are especially
apt to accumulate in the lower part of the bowel and around the anus.We find also hemorrhoidal swelling and ulcerations, which may be
regarded as partly a cause, partly a result, of the ulcerative
proctitis.In this condition the most extensive ravages are found in the rectum
and sigmoid flexure.The causes are identical with those of catarrh of
the large intestine, if we except the follicular disease produced by
dysenteric infection.In this form of the disease, at least in its
earlier stage, the form of these ulcers is always round and
funnel-shaped, with distinct thickening of the edges of the mucous
membrane around the ulcers.These appearances may be explained by the
mode in which the follicular ulcerations originate: "The solitary
follicles become swollen, a result of catarrhal irritation, and the
cellular elements accumulate in the reticulum, giving rise at first to
nodules which project above the level of the mucous membrane: then the
newly-formed tissue-elements become necrosed in consequence of the
mutual pressure of the cells upon {895} each other; finally, the apices
of the follicular nodules give way and the ulcers are formed.The
surrounding mucous membrane bends over downward toward the base of the
ulcer, so that the orifices of the crypts look down into the same."[14]
As the suppurative process extends, particularly in the submucosa, and
the tissue surrounding the follicles becomes destroyed, these small
ulcers coalesce to form larger ones, and the undermined edges of the
mucous membrane project over the base of the ulcers, bleed, and become
necrosed.Healing is possible by cicatrization, the borders of mucous
membrane becoming applied to the base of the ulcer and gradually drawn
together by the cicatricial tissue.Still, this result is extremely
rare if the ulcerative process has gained much headway.When, however,
a follicular ulcer of some size does heal, cicatricial stenosis may
result, followed by chronic constipation, just as in the case of simple
catarrhal ulceration.The situation of follicular ulcerations is almost
always in the large intestine, and they vary considerably in number:
sometimes only a few follicles are thus affected, while in other cases
the bowel is crowded with them.[Footnote 14: Rokitansky, _Path.The anus and rectum may become the seat of chancroidal invasion.An
ulcer of this character fairly within the rectum is very rarely met
with, especially in this country, and could scarcely be produced except
by unnatural intercourse.They are of not uncommon occurrence in the
anal region, and are met with in this situation more frequently among
females than among males.Occurring among the former, they no doubt
often arise from accidental contact during normal sexual intercourse.When this condition is found in males, it rather indicates at least an
attempt at unnatural intercourse.Of 1271 males affected with
chancroids, only 3 were found with the disease in the anal region.Out
of 388 females similarly affected, 33 were found with chancroid of the
verge of the anus.The table of Debauge gives 23 cases among 206
females having chancroid in various other situations.The destruction
of tissue in these cases may be very serious should the nature of the
ulcer not be recognized, and stricture of the rectum or cicatricial
stenosis of the anus might result.Ulceration of the rectum may occur
during chronic proctitis; it may accompany advanced states of prolapse
and procidentia of the bowel; it may attack a stricture of the rectum
and cause peritonitis by erosion.Ulceration may accompany hemorrhoids,
or it may attack them and cause dangerous hemorrhage.Finally, a very
intractable form of ulceration may follow the clamp-and-cautery
operation upon piles.When this untoward result is seen, it is usually
due to the fact that the patient has been allowed to move about too
soon.Allingham claims to have seen these ulcerated stumps of piles
even ten days after operation.Peri-anal and Peri-rectal Abscess.The ischio-rectal fossa is peculiarly liable to attacks of inflammation
resulting in abscess, as it is filled with much loose connective tissue
which supports a considerable amount of fat, and is situated in a
region which is constantly exposed to injury both from within and
without.It is a very vascular part, being freely supplied by branches
of the inferior {896} hemorrhoidal arteries and veins; the latter,
being large and destitute of valves, empty into the portal circulation.Abscess in this region is of very common occurrence, and may attack any
one at any period of life.It occurs more frequently among men than
among women, and usually during middle life.Abscesses in this situation may be acute or chronic.The former variety
may be caused by injury to the anus or to the surrounding parts; by
exposure to cold and wet, and particularly by sitting upon damp seats
while the body is overheated; by impaction of feces, constipation, and
straining at stool.Irritating substances swallowed with the food, such
as small pieces of bone, oyster-shell, or the stones of fruit, may
excite abscess by their presence in the rectum.Among other causes are
general debility, an impoverished state of the blood, the scrofulous
and tuberculous diatheses.The disease sometimes occurs in quite young
infants.Wetherill reports the case of an infant attacked by an
enormous ischio-rectal abscess while nursing from the mother, who was
at the time suffering from a succession of boils.Many cases have been
traced to sitting upon the outside of damp omnibuses.Hepatic
disorders, causing engorgement and stasis of the blood in the
hemorrhoidal plexus, have frequently occasioned this condition.These
abscesses are not always situated in the ischio-rectal fossa;
frequently they are subcutaneous and just outside the anus: in other
cases the starting-point may be ulceration of the mucous membrane of
the rectum, with escape of fecal matter into the areolar tissue; they
also originate in the submucous connective tissue of the rectum.The
acute abscess is sudden and very severe in its onset; the pain is
continuous, throbbing, and augmented during defecation; dysuria is
almost always present, and in some cases there is total inability to
pass water.There is local tenderness, dusky redness, and fluctuating
prominence, and, if not interfered with, a rupture of the integument
will take place and the pus will escape externally.Sometimes their
formation is accompanied with a chill or with a succession of rigors:
there is always considerable constitutional disturbance, febrile
movement, loss of appetite, and malaise.This form of abscess is
usually circumscribed and does not burrow irregularly, and sudden
relief of pain and distress is coincident with their evacuation.Chronic rectal abscess corresponds to the cold or chronic abscess in
other situations: it is apt to occur among those who are much
debilitated or among those of the scrofulous diathesis.These abscesses
have little disposition to open spontaneously upon the surface, but
they burrow extensively in all other directions--high up along the
outside of the rectum, laterally into the tissues of the buttock, or
downward and forward into the perineum.The process of formation may
occupy many months, and sad havoc may be occasioned before their
existence is suspected.They occasion no pain nor distress nor acute
febrile movement, but may be accompanied with a hectic condition,
erratic sweatings, and rapid loss of strength.Upon examination of the
anal region in these cases a painless flat, boggy, crepitating
enlargement is the only surface-indication of the probably extensive
damage sustained by the deeper structures.This form of abscess may be of traumatic origin, but more frequently
the inflammatory process arises in the cellular tissue of the
ischio-rectal fossa; in some cases the morbid action is due to
ulceration of the rectum.{897} In either case peri-rectal or peri-anal
cellulitis will be induced.When these abscesses are of strumous origin
the pus is thin, curdy, and offensive.Both the acute and the chronic abscesses of this region are often
difficult to heal, the external opening remaining permanently patulous,
communication with the bowel resulting from internal burrowing and
erosion, with the formation of extensive sinuses in all directions,
resulting in fistulae in ano.This condition occurs more frequently than any other of the
abnormalities of this region, Mr.Allingham finding 1208 out of his
table of 4000 consecutive cases of diseases of the rectum and anus.He
found also that fistulae followed rectal abscess in 151 out of 196
cases, the abscesses which healed kindly and gave no further trouble
being only 45 in number.A fistula in ano is a linear ulceration with a
patulous orifice which discharges pus: it may or may not communicate
with the bowel, and it may have more than one external opening.The
great majority of fistulae in this region are caused by abscess, either
arising in the submucous areolar tissue of the bowel, or in the
subcutaneous connective tissue in the immediate neighborhood of the
anus, or in the ischio-rectal fossa, or in an ulcerated state of the
mucous membrane of the rectum: in other cases it is congenital, or it
may result from the presence of foreign bodies or worms in the bowel,
or from puncture of the rectum by pins, scales of shell, fragments of
bone, or other sharp substances swallowed with the food.Abscesses
leading to fistulae have followed kicks, blows, or wounds of the anal
region: in short, anything which induces an abscess here may result in
a fistula, and as in the former more cases occur in males than females,
and more during middle age than at any other period, the same is true
as to the latter.Fistula is quite common among the phthisical as a
result of malnutrition and septicaemia, aided by the constant
succussion of the perineum produced by efforts at coughing.Of the 4000
cases previously referred to, 1208 were cases of fistula; "of these,
172 presented more or less marked symptoms of lung trouble,
haemoptysis, cough, or impaired resonance in some portion of the
chest."To be complete, it must have
two openings (it may have more)--one in the anus or rectum, and one
upon the surface.There are two forms of the incomplete or blind
fistula--one in which there exists an internal but no external opening,
and the other in which there is an external but no internal opening.In
complete fistula there may be more than one external opening, and this
is in the majority of cases not far from the anus, but it may open in
the perineum or upon any part of the gluteal region.When the openings
are multiple they usually converge to form a common tract or sinus.The
external opening presents nothing to the untutored eye to lead to the
suspicion of grave internal trouble: frequently the vent is so minute
and valvular or shielded by a thin pellicle as to be entirely
overlooked; in other cases a little teat formed of superabundant
granulations guards the entrance: there may or may not be
discoloration, elevation, or depression of the surrounding integument,
and erythema resulting from the {898} irritating nature of the
discharge.Inflamed and suppurating follicles in the integument about
the anus are not to be mistaken for the orifices of fistulous tracts.The internal opening in anal fistula is situated between the sphincter
muscles, sometimes just within the anus, but oftener about half an inch
above; in rectal fistula the internal opening or openings may be at any
point above the internal sphincter.These sinuses may be very tortuous,
with pockets, blind passages, or diverticulae, and are known as
horseshoe fistulae when they commence at one side of the bowel and
ulcerate around it to a point opposite before making an opening.Of the two varieties of incomplete fistulae, by far the least frequent
is that where no internal opening exists, but where there are one or
more external orifices: these do not invariably even run toward the
bowel, but may extend off through the tissues in any direction.In the
other variety, where there exists no external evidence of disease,
considerable damage may be done before its recognition.Fistula may
coexist with hemorrhoids, stricture, ulcer, or malignant growth: it may
be a very trivial affair, with the internal but a fraction of an inch
from the external opening, or it may be long, deep, and tortuous, with
sinuses running in all directions through the buttock.Usually, fistulae become worse when not operated upon, but there are
cases which have healed without surgical interference--others in which
this condition has gone on for many years without getting any worse or
without the discharge increasing in amount.The fluid discharged from a
chronic fistula loses after a time much of its purulent character and
becomes serous and watery; but fresh abscess and inflammation is apt to
take place in these cases from feculent matter lodging in the sinus.Those which burrow most readily are the internal fistulae with large
openings, into which the feces are pushed, with the sinus running
toward the anus, because of their funnel-shape.The presence of fistula may be suspected if there are in the anal
region abscesses which have not completely healed, or which, having
apparently done so, break out from time to time and discharge pus; or
from the existence of a circumscribed hardness or swelling
unaccompanied by an opening which varies in size and is at times
painful; or if there exist any ulcerated moist openings.To make a
positive diagnosis the tract must be explored by a probe: enter the
oiled, blunt-pointed probe gently into the external opening and let it
find its way along without force, bending the probe if necessary, until
it has traversed the sinus as far as it will go; then pass the finger
into the rectum and feel about for an internal opening or for the point
of the probe.If the finger be introduced first, the relations of the
parts are interfered with and the internal opening, should one exist,
might not readily be found.Sometimes the bottom of the tract does not
correspond in situation to the internal opening, but extends beyond it.In those cases where no external opening exists, the rectal speculum,
aided by judicious pressure, will discover an issue of pus from a sinus
upon the mucous membrane of the rectum.In order to illustrate the amount of damage which a small foreign body
may cause when lodged in the rectum, Wetherill relates the following
case, which occurred in his practice at the Pennsylvania Hospital for
the Insane: The patient was a middle-aged man, intelligent, and an
{899} employe of the hospital."Upon examination of the anal region I
found a small, tender, firm swelling, which did not fluctuate, about an
inch to the left of the anus: this had been forming for about a week,
and there was no history of painful defecation, of exposure to damp and
cold, nor of a blow or injury of the part.Without waiting for the
development of fluctuation, I made a free and deep incision into the
ischio-rectal space, and a large quantity of very fetid pus escaped:
upon introducing a large probe I found that it passed up into the fossa
to a depth of four and a quarter inches and turned but slightly toward
the bowel.Remembering the experience of Allingham, that when the pus
in these cases was very offensive there existed an opening in the
bowel, I questioned the patient again as to pain in the bowel or
painful defecation, which was answered in the negative.No
communication could be found with the finger in the bowel and a probe
in the wound, and poultices were applied, liquid diet ordered, and the
man kept in bed.The cavity was loosely filled with absorbent cotton
and the entire wound (apparently) healed slowly, but kindly, and in
about ten days after operation the patient left the house to all
appearance sound.About a week after the patient returned with the
report that he felt uneasy throbbing in the part, and that there was a
very slight discharge.Upon inspection I found in the surface-line of
the cicatrix a pinhole opening which yielded upon pressure a drop or
two of pus; upon entering a very fine probe it passed into a narrow
sinus to a depth of three and a quarter inches, but no communication
could be made with it with the finger in the bowel.Upon withdrawing
the probe it grated over something which felt like dead bone, about two
inches from the surface.I enlarged the opening, introduced a pair of
fine dressing-forceps, and withdrew a piece of the rib of a chicken
about half an inch in length and sharpened at one extremity to a fine
point.Upon making inquiry I found that he had not eaten any chicken
since the development of the abscess.He then suddenly remembered that
while he was at stool a few days prior to the formation of the abscess
he experienced a sudden pang of very acute pain in the rectum, which,
however, soon passed off.This was no doubt the moment when the piece
of chicken-bone pierced the rectum."Hemorrhage from the Rectum.Hemorrhage from the rectum may be accidental, primary, or
secondary--accidental when it follows the ulceration of internal piles
or the erosion of large arterial or venous trunks during the progress
of malignant disease, or when it occurs from the rupture of a rectum
during defecation--a very rare and curious occurrence reported by M. E.
Quenu;[15] primary when it occurs during, and secondary when it occurs
after, a surgical operation upon these parts.[Footnote 15: _Revue de Chirurg.Hemorrhage from the rectum without any structural lesions is quite
unusual, but occasionally copious losses of blood are seen in vicarious
menstruation, and several instances have been reported.When ligatures separate after operations upon those of broken-down
constitution very copious and dangerous bleeding may occur without any
symptoms save a "sensation of something trickling in the bowel," {900}
a feeling of weight and fulness in the part, with increasing weakness
and syncope of the patient, until he expresses a desire to go to stool,
when suddenly a large quantity of blood escapes.SECONDARY DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.This class of affections depends upon constitutional infection, direct
extension of disease by contiguity, by contiguity from disease in
neighboring organs, or by abnormal conditions excited by disease of
remote origin; and are frequently due to changes in the nervous and
vascular supply.Syphilis of the Rectum and Anus.True primary syphilitic chancre of the rectum must be an extremely rare
lesion, and could have been acquired only by unnatural intercourse.There are syphilographers who deny that the hard chancre has ever been
found within the sphincter muscles; but it certainly is not uncommonly
found in the anal region, and oftener among women than men.The table
of Jullien gives 12 instances of this lesion in males, and 1 instance
of chancre of the buttock, out of 77 cases, while among 82 cases
occurring in the opposite sex, 21 were of the anus and perineum and 4
of the buttocks.The French authorities give the frequency of this
condition in men as 1 case in every 119; in women, 1 case in every 12.Anal chancres are easily overlooked, as they occupy the puckered folds
of the anus, which when not opened out to the fullest extent afford
perfect concealment: they may be either in the form of cracks or slight
fissures, elongated ulcerations, or firm papules.It has been claimed
that the initial lesion has provoked stricture of the rectum, but this
is not probable.The secondary manifestations of this disease which show themselves in
the anal region are some of the syphilodermata, moist papules, mucous
patches, and moist papillomatous excrescences or condylomata.The
statistical tables of Davasse and Deville[16] in regard to the
occurrence of moist papules and mucous patches in women show that out
of 186 cases they appeared about the anus in 59 and on the perineum in
40.Bassereau's[17] statistics show that in men these lesions occurred
in the anal region 110 times out of 130 cases.These are, of course,
very contagious.Besides true syphilitic warts, which sometimes occur
in this region, it is quite usual to see the anus surrounded and the
entire gluteal cleft filled up with moist, offensive, papillomatous
excrescences, which remain obstinately so long as these surfaces are
permitted to rest in moist contact.Syphilitic stricture of the rectum
is one of the results of a later stage of infection, and occurs oftener
among women than men.It is stated by Jullien that of 60 cases only 7
were men, the remaining 53 women.They are invariably formed as
follows: A gummatous deposit in the {901} submucosa undergoes
ulceration, and the subsequent cicatricial contraction gives rise to
the stricture.Whether the stricture will be valvular or annular
depends upon the extent of rectal mucous membrane involved in the
ulcerative process.The diffuse gummatous infiltration of the
ano-rectal tissues and the subsequent deposition of contractile tissue
are the most usual causes of these specific strictures.The lower
portion of the rectum is commonly the situation of specific
ulcerations, usually of the secondary or tertiary stage, which lead to
the formation of stricture: this occurs more frequently among women
than men, and between the ages of seventeen and thirty years.Gosselin
and Mason regard strictures as the result of chancres, and not as the
result of constitutional infection; but it is known that ulcerations of
secondary syphilis may extend upward from affections about the anus,
and also that gummata do commonly give origin to this condition.Gummata, and strictures following them, may be distinguished from other
affections on account of the greater distance from the anus at which
they occur, chancres or chancroid ulcers being usually within four or
five centimeters of the anal orifice.Strictures due to gummata are
more apt to occur late in life, but may therefore be easily confounded
with cancer.Condylomata at the anus are often associated with
syphilitic disease of the rectum.cit._]


Scrofulous and Tuberculous Affections.There are cases which yield abundant evidence of struma in the form of
enlarged glands, chronic abscess in the neck, swelling and abscess in
the vicinity of the articulations, and the like, in which ulceration of
the mucous membrane of the rectum has been found: this condition may
result in fistula in ano by erosion, permitting escape of flatus and
excrementitious products into the cellular tissue.A similar result may
follow by erosion of the bowel from a strumous abscess in the
connective tissue around the rectum; both these forms tend to the
production of that class of fistula which has no outlet at the surface,
but which has one or more openings upon the mucous membrane of the
rectum.Thus concealed (for often there is no marked surface indication
of either abscess or fistula), they may remain for a long time
unsuspected and acting as a serious drain upon the already impaired
constitution.The pus in these cases is watery, curdy, and offensive.These chronic conditions are subject to intercurrent attacks of acute
inflammation, due to the lodgment in the abscess cavity or the
fistulous tract of fecal matter or indigestible solid substances.Any
or all of the abnormalities of this region may be complicated by the
existence of tubercular or scrofulous conditions of the system.Tubercular ulceration of the rectum is now a well-recognized condition.Rectal ulceration and tubercular disease of the lungs have not been
found to coexist in any marked preponderating number of tabulated
cases.The frequent association of fistula in ano and tubercular
disease of the lungs has long been recognized, Allingham having found
172 such cases among 1208 cases of fistula in ano.The pathology of tubercular ulceration of the rectum is graphically
described in _Ziemssen's Encyclopaedia_ as follows: "These
[ulcerations] begin in the follicular apparatus with swelling of the
individual {902} follicles and their vicinity from tuberculous deposit.The newly-formed cells become caseous, the superficial layer of the
tubercle breaks down, and thus ulcerations arise of a round funnel
shape.The enlargement of these ulcerations is probably produced by the
constant formation in the base and edges of the ulcers of new nodules,
which themselves caseate and ulcerate.This process of extension, to
which these tuberculous ulcerations of the intestines exhibit a marked
tendency, takes place chiefly in a transverse direction (girdle-shape),
following the direction of the blood-vessels.The infiltration and
necrosis may advance longitudinally, and, finally, the individual
ulcerations coalesce with each other: in this way may be explained in
part the dentate appearance of the edges of these ulcerations.The
ulceration extends also in depth, although usually the muscular coat
appears to be covered by a thick layer of connective tissue: the
destruction advances slowly in the muscularis, but in the lymphatic
vessels which pierce the muscularis less opposition is presented to the
progress of the tuberculosis; and thus it is not uncommon to find
tubercles ranged one after the other, like links in a chain, from the
base of the ulcer directly down to the serosa.The most frequent situation is the lower end of the ileum, but
the process may extend upward to the stomach, or downward, involving
the rectum.There is almost invariably unmistakable signs of
tuberculosis in other organs.It is possibly never primary, but this is
a still-disputed point.It usually occurs with tuberculosis of the
lungs, and when so occurring it is always secondary.The clinical
symptoms of this state are by no means characteristic."Dwelling upon the subject of intestinal tubercle, it has been suggested
by Klebs[18] that the intestinal disease is produced by swallowing
morbid products derived from phthisical lungs--an hypothesis supported
also by the fact that tubercle in the intestines tends so strongly to
spread downward."The seat of the deposit is the submucous tissue or
the corium of the mucous membrane: it is certainly subjacent to the
basement membrane, and not contained in the follicles, as Creswell
taught."[Footnote 18: Jones and Sieveking, London, pp.Woodward, in his article upon diarrhoea,[19] says: "The lesions,
whether mild or severe, are most generally seated in the caecum and
colon, but more or less extensive tracts of the small intestine,
especially of the ileum, are often involved also."He continues:
"Tubercular disease of the lung was noted in nearly one-sixth of the
autopsies of fatal cases of forms of flux heretofore described.Possibly the frequency in chronic cases may be explained by the fact
that protracted intestinal flux forms the development of lung phthisis
in the predisposed."History of the War of the Rebellion_, p.The rectal fissure or painful ulcer may be connected with diathetic
causes, as struma or scrofula: it is doubtful if syphilis should be
included among its causes.Cancer, Malignant Stricture, and Malignant Ulceration.The forms of cancer met with in these regions are epitheliomatous,
scirrhous, encephaloid, and colloid.Considerable diversity of opinion
has {903} existed as to which variety occurs most frequently; but it is
now probably a matter of absolute knowledge that the epithelial form is
the one most commonly observed, and next to that in frequency the
scirrhous form.Encephaloid and colloid are of quite infrequent
occurrence.Again, as to the sex in which this affection appears the
most often, there is much disparity existing between surgical writers:
it is usually thought to be much more prevalent among women than among
men.This is not the experience of many of the authorities upon this
subject, yet the statistics of the Hotel Dieu, Paris, furnish
overwhelming evidence in favor of its preponderance in women.Carcinoma
of the rectum, occurring as a primary infiltration in the rectum,
probably occurs oftener in men, but there are among females so many
contiguous structures prone to cancerous degenerations, as the uterus,
the vagina, the ovaries, the Fallopian tubes, tumors and cancerous
masses occupying Douglas's cul-de-sac, that it would seem likely that
they would be more frequently the victims of secondary cancerous
deposit in the bowel or of erosion and extension of disease by
contiguity or continuity.Epithelioma in other situations attacks men
much more frequently than women.This form of disease usually occurs in
middle life and in old age, but to this general rule there have been
many exceptions; it has been seen in children.Allingham quotes its
occurrence in a lad of seventeen, and Gowland in one of thirteen.It
very rarely occurs as a secondary deposit of cancer in a remote region
or organ.In the table of 4000 cases of rectal and anal disease, before
referred to, cancer existed in 105.This disease is usually within easy
reach of the finger, except when the growth is in the sigmoid flexure,
being within an inch or two of the anus or from two and a half to three
inches above it.The epithelial form, when it commences at the anus, is
closely analogous to epithelioma of the lip: from the anal outlet it
spreads upward into the bowel, or it may be primarily seated there.When occupying the junction of skin with mucous membrane it is
sometimes sluggish, and a long time may elapse before it takes on
aggressive action: induration, nodulation, obstinate fissure, or
fungous growth marks its inception; as the condition proceeds,
infiltration of surrounding structures takes place and large, hard,
irregular masses form, which ulcerate, split, and form cauliflower
excrescences.The rectum becomes blocked with fungoid growths: both
these and the cancer proper are very vascular, and frequent hemorrhages
occur, and an offensive muco-purulent discharge constantly oozes from
the bowel.Scirrhus of the rectum commences as an infiltration of the submucosa,
which rapidly involves the other elements of the bowel, pushing hard
nodules upward into the lumen of the intestinal tube: these break down
and form ragged ulcers with indurated margins, and bleed profusely.Its
situation is usually not higher than three inches above the anus.It
has a tendency to invade all the neighboring organs and soft
structures, to bind them to itself in a firm, dense mass, and to form
communications with the vagina, bladder, uterus, perineum, and penis.Abscesses and fistulae are common complications.These neoplasms are insidious in their onset, and when seated at some
little distance from the anus do not excite much pain at first.In the
epithelial form the anus presents an abnormal appearance: it is
inflamed and is covered with irritated, hypertrophied tags of
integument bathed in {904} a sanious, offensive fluid.Difficult
defecation, of which the natural form is absent, with inordinate
tenesmus, a sense of weight and fulness in the bowel, and an irritable
condition of the bladder, are among the symptoms.The feces are passed
in little, irregular lumps or broken fragments, or this state is
accompanied by or alternates with small, liquid, offensive stools.As
the diseased action proceeds, very severe local and general pain is
endured: this is of a dull, lancinating character, and affects not only
the diseased bowel, but involves the entire contents of the pelvis,
shoots down the thighs, up the back, and into the penis: frequent and
exhausting hemorrhages take place; the patient exhales a peculiar
sickening odor; his complexion becomes cachectic; his strength fails;
and death ensues, after a variable period of intense suffering, from a
few months to two or three years after the first symptoms appeared.The
modes of termination of life in these cases are--exhaustion, secondary
deposition, septicaemia, peritonitis, and hemorrhage.Stricture of the
bowel and very extensive ulceration attend all of these advanced cases
of malignant rectal disease.The encephaloid variety is prone to very sudden and rapid breaking
down, and may destroy life within a few months.If the finger be passed
into the bowel in a case of encephaloid degeneration, it will encounter
a large soft tumor occluding the gut: this is a very different
sensation from that imparted to the finger in a case of epithelioma or
scirrhus.In the former there will be felt a crepitating, as though due
to the giving way of a moist, friable substance; in the latter the
touch will perceive dense, irregular nodulations and ragged ulcerations
having very firm margins.The rectum may also be involved and destroyed by any of these neoplasms
in neighboring organs.A middle-aged woman who was admitted to the
Pennsylvania Hospital in a very advanced stage of epithelioma of the
cervix uteri died from hemorrhage from the rectum and uterus in eight
minutes.At the autopsy it was found that the disease had almost
separated the cervix from the body of the uterus, had involved the
cul-de-sac of Douglas, and had eroded a large opening into the rectum.Numerous ends of large vessels were observed which had undergone
erosion.Carcinoma of distant organs does not seem to frequently involve the
rectum by secondary deposition."In 160 cases of gastric cancer
examined at the Pathological Institution in Prague, Dittrich found
secondary cancer of the rectum only twice."[20]

[Footnote 20: Leube, _Ziemssen's Cyclopaed._, vol.In these cases of carcinomatous disease originating in the bowel the
neighboring lymphatic glands are indurated and enlarged, and secondary
deposition in neighboring and distant organs is the rule.The lower portion of the intestinal tract may become involved in
disease by direct extension from the colon, as in dysentery following
enteritis or entero-colitis.Habersham says that diarrhoea arises
generally from an irritated condition of the large intestine, catarrhal
and mucous diarrhoea from slight inflammatory disease closely allied to
ordinary coryza affecting the mucous membrane of the large intestine."In the diarrhoea of soldiers the lesions of the large intestine have
been either those of congestion with varying degree of extravasation or
of ulceration more or less extensive.The colon in the former cases has
invariably presented {905} patches of intense congestion, and in
numerous instances extravasation, the amount and intensity varying in
different subjects, in a few the whole mucous surface of the intestine
having a livid red color; in others tracts of more or less intense
congestion at irregular intervals, as in the small intestines, would be
noticed.The ileo-caecal valve almost invariably presented intense
congestion.The rectum has uniformly presented intense congestion, with
more or less fibrinous exudation.Frequently the presence of fibrinous
exudation was a question of doubt."[21] The entero-colitis or ordinary
summer complaint of infants not infrequently causes a very troublesome
form of proctitis.Besides the ordinary causes of dysentery, Feyrer[22]
states that it is caused by irritation of the solar plexus of nerves,
also by the inhalation of sewer emanations and by the ingestion of
impure water.History of the War of the Rebellion_,
vol.[Footnote 22: _Times and Gazette_, 1881, p."In dysentery the anus becomes bluish-red, and is even marked with
cracks and rents; it is painful to the touch and tightly contracted.In
the later stages of severe cases it becomes large and gaping; then the
stools are generally discharged unconsciously, and the pain is slight,
paralysis of the sphincter ani having occurred.These symptoms indicate
generally that death is to be expected.In some of these cases the
pathological lesions are limited to the rectum.Dysentery may succeed
typhoid fever."[23]

[Footnote 23: Heubner, _Ziemssen_, vol."Pigmentation is common after dysentery, and also after typhoid fever
when dysentery has existed.Pigment-deposits are encountered in the
large intestine in those who have suffered from repeated attacks of
acute diarrhoea or from protracted flux.They may be seated as diffuse
patches on the general surface of the mucous membrane or may be more
especially localized in the closed glands.The diffuse form of these
deposits is more frequently encountered in the large than in the small
intestine, and is apt to be more intense in the former, producing
darker and more extensive discoloration; hence the ash- and
slate-, greenish, and blackish tracts which are so frequently
observed in the caecum, colon, and rectum."[24] Follicular ulceration
of the rectum sometimes follows chronic dysentery and typhoid fever.Woodward has observed that a catarrhal condition of the rectum commonly
occurs in typhoid fever cases.Referring to typhoid fever lesions of
the large intestine, Rokitansky[25] says: "The ulcerative process is by
no means confined to the small intestine; we have seen the mucous
membrane of the large intestine riddled with ulcers.They were many of
them of large size, and had clean-cut, non-thickened margins.This
condition, indicating the absence of reparative action, is not nearly
so frequent as that of thickening and induration, which generally took
place to some extent in the edges of the ulcers.The bottoms of the
ulcers are commonly formed by the submucous tissue.Sometimes the
muscular fibres are completely exposed: this, however, is generally the
result of secondary advance subsequent to the reception of the morbid
action."[Footnote 25: Jones and Sieveking, p.John Harley[26] calls attention to the intestinal lesions of scarlatina
as follows: "I know of no disease in which the morbid effects are more
{906} uniform.Scarlatina is essentially a disease of the lymphatic
system.It is attended with inflammatory action of this system of
glands, in which are included the agminated glands of the intestine.In
28 cases examined, 8 had the solitary glands of the large intestine
enlarged and inflamed; in 1 there was acute desquamation of the mucous
membrane of nearly the whole of the large intestine.In about half the
cases the large intestine was found healthy."[Footnote 26: _Med.-Chir.The rectum and anus are frequently subject to attacks, by contiguity,
from diseases in neighboring organs.The most frequent of these is
doubtless that form of ischio-rectal abscess which invades the bowel,
causing fistula in ano.Various neoplasms having their seat in the
tissues or organs near the bowel may obstruct it by simple mechanical
pressure, or may cause inflammation, infiltration, and ulcerative
erosion.Mechanical encroachment by the pressure of a foreign body in
the vagina may cause grave interference with the normal functions of
the lower bowel.At the out-patient department of the Pennsylvania
Hospital in 1880, Arthur V. Meigs, assisted by Wetherill, removed a
large, hollow, glass ball-pessary from the upper end of the vagina of
an aged woman, who declared the pessary had been so placed by a
physician sixteen years before, and had remained ever since, despite
her repeated efforts to remove it with an ordinary table-fork.Upon its
extraction, which was accomplished with difficulty, a small portion of
its surface was found covered with scratches.Its presence had caused
constipation, impaction of feces, and atony of the rectum.Interference with the rectal functions often follows tedious cases of
labor where the child's head remains long in the perineum.The Effect of Abnormal Conditions of the Spinal Cord and its Membranes
upon the Rectum and Anus."In diseases of the spinal cord and its envelopes there is a great
tendency to constipation, owing to impairment of the secretion of the
intestinal juices.The intestinal movements are usually much affected,
either in the way of increase or diminution, in the former of which the
symptom is a frequent, watery, slimy diarrhoea; as a less common
condition it is even capable of being produced reflexly.Thus in a
patient with chronic myelitis I observed the regular evacuation of a
mucous fluid mass from the intestine as often as his bed-sores were
cleansed; and the like has been seen in dogs after division of the
lumbar cord.Much more commonly there is habitual, even excessively
obstinate, constipation, of which almost all chronic spinal patients
complain.The stool is slowly discharged, dry and hard, and the
evacuation occurs only at considerable intervals and after the
application of energetic remedies.Several causes doubtless contribute
to this: diminution of intestinal secretion and peristaltic
contraction, and probably also weakness of the abdominal muscles of
compression, which is often present.If there is an extreme degree of
weakness, meteorism and accumulation of feces are other consequences.We do not know exactly from what portions of the cord these
disturbances proceed."[27]

[Footnote 27: Erb, _Ziemssen's Encyc._, xiii.{907} "There are also in many diseases of the cord disturbances of
evacuation caused by paresis or paralysis of the sphincter ani.In mild
cases simple difficulty in retaining stool for any length of time
exists.There may be also great disturbance of sensibility, so that the
patient does not feel the call, and even if he possess some voluntary
control, he is surprised by the discharge, of which he feels
nothing."[28]

[Footnote 28: Erb, _loc.The sphincter ani is affected in cases of myelitis, the usual symptoms
being those of paralysis; the same is true in softening of the cord or
myelo-malacia, and there is also diminished reflex excitability of the
anus.Paralysis of the bladder and rectum is often delayed in cases of slow
compression of the cord; but if the compression exists to any
considerable extent, involuntary discharges of urine and feces will be
sure to occur.A pressure-myelitis of the lumbar portion of the cord
causes paralysis of the bowel, and in the later stage of some cases of
bulbar paralysis it also occurs.Early in the course of spinal meningitis there exists a spasmodic
condition of the sphincters: these muscles are also paralyzed in spinal
and in meningeal hemorrhage, and from the pressure of tumors upon the
cord giving rise to paraplegia."In acute ascending paralysis the
bladder and rectum are generally quite undisturbed in their functions.In hemiplegia and in hemi-paraplegia specialis disturbances in the
evacuation of the bladder and bowels are almost always present, and in
the acute traumatic cases it is especially common to find severe
paralytic symptoms at the beginning of the attack (complete retention
or complete incontinence, involuntary stools, etc.), which, however,
generally soon recede and give place to lighter, more permanent
trouble, as weakness of the sphincters."[29]

[Footnote 29: Ibid., _loc.The following is an extract from Gower's _Diagnosis and Diseases of the
Spinal Cord_:[30] "The spinal cord possesses centres, situated in the
lumbar enlargement, which preside over the action of the bladder and
rectum.They are probably complex reflex centres: that for the
sphincter ani is the more simple.... But if the volitional path in the
cord is damaged above the lumbar centres, the will can no longer
influence the reflex processes: as soon as the feces irritate the
rectum they are expelled by the reflex mechanism.... If the damage to
the cord involves also the sensory tract, the patient is unconscious of
this process; if the sensory tract is unaffected, the patient is aware
of the action of the bladder or bowel, but cannot control it.It is
often said that there is permanent relaxation of the sphincters, but
this is true only when the lumbar centres are inactive or destroyed.In
this condition evacuation occurs as soon as feces or urine enter; the
urine escapes continuously instead of being expelled at intervals....
We may, however, distinguish between the two states of the rectum by
the introduction of the finger: if the lumbar centre is inactive, there
is a momentary contraction due to local stimulation of the sphincter,
and then permanent relaxation.If, however, the reflex centre and motor
nerves from it are intact, the introduction of the finger is followed
first by relaxation, and then by gentle, firm, tonic contraction."[Footnote 30: London, 1880, p.{908} Morton has at this time in his wards at the Pennsylvania Hospital
two cases of rectal paresis following fracture of the vertebrae.The
first, a lad aged nineteen years, while crossing the Atlantic was
struck during a gale by a spar upon the back about the region of the
lower dorsal vertebrae.From the deformity and from other symptoms
there was undoubtedly a fracture destructive to the normal functions of
the cord.Upon the arrival of the steamer, some ten days after the
accident, the lad was brought to the hospital, where he has remained
for the past eighteen months.Total palsy of sensation and motion has
continued from the time of the accident to the present day, and extends
from the navel downward: the sphincter ani is constantly but feebly
contracted; the finger, when pressed into the anus, encounters slight
resistance, which continues during and after the simple passage of the
finger; very slight pressure, however, against the sphincter causes a
very marked relaxation, which continues so long as this is kept up.With the removal of the finger the sphincter slowly and fairly
contracts.The second case is also one of vertebral fracture which has
been in the hospital about ten months.In this instance the sphincter
is always found contracted, but it readily yields under finger
pressure, and contracts quickly and regularly in the absence of this
pressure.Constipation and rectal impaction readily occur, and the
bowel requires to be regularly emptied.In another case, at the
Episcopal Hospital, under the care of W. B. Hopkins, there is fracture
of the spine, with total palsy below the seat of injury.The margins of
the anus were found in apposition, but in no firm contraction: mere
contact of the finger appeared to have little or no effect, but slight
pressure upon the sphincter caused a contraction, and very moderate
pressure upon the anus after the introduction of the finger produced
excessive dilatation.The action of the sphincter was in all respects
very tardy.Two recent cases (August, 1883) of fracture of the dorsal vertebrae
have been admitted into the Pennsylvania Hospital.One, a lad aged ten
years, was struck by a bale of cotton which fell upon him; the other, a
man aged thirty years, fell from a second-story window.In both cases
total palsy occurred at once upon the receipt of injury, and in each
the same conditions of the anus have obtained as before described.In the convulsive attacks incident to epilepsy the sphincters of the
bowel and urinary bladder are relaxed and the discharges are
involuntary; probably, also, one of the first symptoms indicative of
tumor of the base of the brain is recognized in involuntary rectal
evacuations.Rectal incontinence may be also due to tabes, while atony
and constipation are sometimes noticed as a result of excessive
intellectual exertion (DaCosta).The same may be said of chronic
lesions of the brain and spinal cord.Paresis of the rectum has been
noticed as a result of chronic congestions of the heart and in hepatic
disease.Allingham has observed failing nerve-power as a cause of
rectal atony: the latter, with constipation, is one of the commonest
troubles attendant upon melancholia and the chronic forms of insanity.Seeley of Ovid, New York, related to Morton a case of paraplegia with
rectal paresis and dysenteric symptoms from malarial poisoning in a
married lady aged thirty years.An examination revealed an immense
rectal impaction.A free administration of quinia was followed by
complete recovery in a few weeks.{909} Spasm or Spasmodic Contraction of the Rectum and Anus.Apart from those cases in which spasm is induced by the irritating
stools of diarrhoea and dysentery, or by local ulcerations, fissures of
the anus, and intestinal worms, there are those in which painful spasm
occurs, due to the presence of a vesical calculus: it is also caused by
urethral stricture, impaction of feces, irritations and inflammations
involving the bladder or the adjacent organs.Spasm is also seen in
nervous females, without constipation; also in the varied irritations
of the female genito-urinary apparatus.In cases where spasm is due to
rectal impaction retraction of the anus is frequently seen.This most painful, distressing, and obstinate affection belongs to the
class of neuroses, and is simply functional in character, without the
least structural change in the skin or mucous membrane of the anus or
rectum: the itching may be confined to the former or it may extend into
the latter.It may be brought about by a constipated state of the
bowels, but it is more often due to derangements of the digestive
apparatus.Sufferers from pruritus ani are generally dyspeptics, although the
malady is observed in persons who are otherwise in most robust health.Overwork, mental and physical exhaustion, have been charged with
producing pruritus, and in some instances spinal irritation seems to
have been unquestionably the exciting cause: now and again, pruritus
ani has been produced by the pregnant condition, and in some cases this
malady has persisted during the entire period of utero-gestation.Intestinal worms, uterine maladies, rheumatism, and especially gout,
have unquestionably been exciting causes.Some years since a gentleman
having the most intense pruritus, which defied all treatment, was
suddenly relieved of all former distressing symptoms by the passage of
a small vesical calculus, the presence of which had never been
suspected, as no vesical symptoms had at any time existed.Some of the
most aggravated instances of anal pruritus are found in those far
advanced in diabetes mellitus.The nerves of the lumbar plexus in rare
instances have suffered from compression, more or less severe, from
fecal accumulations; in one case of spinal curvature detailed by
Portal[31] the rectum at its upper part was so narrowed by the
encroachment of the false ribs that excessive fecal accumulation
occurred which gave rise to remote pain in the great toe.[Footnote 31: _Cours d'Anatomie medicale_, tome iv.It seems to be unquestionable that there are instances of pure
neuralgia of the rectum, for in such cases the most carefully conducted
explorations have failed in demonstrating any evidences of disease.The
pain is doubtless reflex, due to depressing causes, to atmospheric
conditions, or to exposure to cold and wet.Neuralgia of the rectum has
also been noticed in malarial {910} poisoning, and especially in those
who have long been victims of intermittent fever.Neuralgia in this
region of the body is also due to general causes, as witnessed in cases
of rheumatism and of the gouty diathesis.Patients now and again
complain of "violent and painful pressure in the rectum, conjoined with
active pains in the perineum and anus and in the sexual parts: these
symptoms probably have a neuralgic character."[32] In many nervous
disorders, but especially in spinal irritations or inflammation, the
rectum is invaded by pains of a neuralgic nature more or less severe,
which are undoubtedly only functional in character.But 12 cases of
neuralgia were observed out of 4000 cases of rectal disease.Anstie[33]
says: "It needs some very powerful irritant to set up neuralgia in any
portion of the alimentary canal:... this condition has been described
by Ashton.... In one case the patient complained of acute, paroxysmal,
cutting pain extending about an inch within the rectum.... The cause of
this attack was his getting chilled from sitting in his wet clothes."Curling says that constantly directing the mind to this part of the
body will excite congestion and disease, possibly by producing abnormal
sensations, itching, and superficial inflammation.[Footnote 32: Erb, _Ziemssen's Cyclop._, vol.[Footnote 33: _Neuralgia and its Counterfeits_, p."In patients with piles hyperaemia of the spinal cord may become
habitual, returning regularly and frequently, and this may lead by
degrees to severer disturbance by the development of chronic
inflammation and proliferation."[34] Among some of the reflex troubles
arising from rectal disease are--sterility in women, simulation of
uterine disease, pruritus ani, pseudo-sciatica, pains in the legs and
feet, and impairment of co-ordination in the muscles of defecation.There is a case reported[35] of a curious pain in the sole of a foot
caused by rectal disease; and another[36] in which irritation of the
eyes was caused by hemorrhoids.[Footnote 34: _Ziemssen's Cyclop._, vol.Times and Gazette_, 1868, vol.[Footnote 36: Cooper, _Lancet_, 1862, i. p.There are some cases occasionally met with of so-called irritable
rectum.Now, a rectum may be irritable because irritated, but in some
of these instances there is no apparent cause.There occur frequent,
small stools expelled with force, but without pain: there must be
abnormal peristaltic action to cause this condition.The Effects of Cholera and of Certain Poisons and Remedies upon the
Rectum.After death from cholera there is found congestion and a swollen state
of the mucous membrane of the rectum: in some cases the epithelium of
the entire alimentary canal is almost absent.In slow poisoning by
arsenic the bowels show ulceration, but more particularly the rectum.After phosphorus-poisoning the large intestine has been found inflamed
and contracted to the calibre of a quill.Among the effects of copper
have been seen ulceration and a peculiar green staining of the rectum;
of lead, no marked change of the mucous membrane except, in some
instances, hardening, but the muscularis was in an advanced state of
hardening and contraction.The action of croton oil is to render the
mucosa very soft and friable.Extensive destruction of the mucous
membrane of the rectum has resulted {911} from poisoning by bichromate
of potassium.The mineral acids and the caustic alkalies, when not
immediately fatal, cause corrosive ulceration of the rectum; the
soluble salts of zinc, tin, bismuth, and antimony produce a like
effect.Corrosive sublimate in its action upon the large intestine
produces a dysenteric condition; similar in their effects are
colocynth, jalap, elaterium, and cantharides.Strychnia causes a deep
violet congestion; alcohol, congestion and thickening; and tobacco,
redness of the mucous membrane with great engorgement of the vessels of
the rectum.One of the results of the long-continued abuse of morphia
is a catarrhal condition of the large intestine, accompanied with
exfoliation of the intestinal epithelium.Some persons are very
susceptible to the action of jaborandi, and in such its exhibition is
followed by hyperaesthesia and dull pain in the rectum and the urethra.It is interesting to note that an abnormal condition in the rectum may
cause extensive disease in a remote organ; thus, a stricture of the
rectum may cause abscess in the liver.Wilkes[37] exhibited at the
Pathological Society a specimen in which an abscess, a diffuse,
purulent infiltration of the liver, and a gall-bladder filled with
purulent bile were distinctly traceable to the suppuration arising from
an ulcerating stricture of the rectum consisting of dense fibrous
tissue situated about four inches from the anus of a man aged
thirty-seven years."Any form of suppurative intestinal disease seems
capable of producing hepatic abscesses of a metastatic or pyaemic
character."[38] It has not been found, however, that tubercular
ulceration of the intestines has ever given rise to hepatic abscess.[Footnote 38: Darley, _On the Liver_, 1883, p.Examinations and explorations of the abdominal viscera by the hand
introduced into the rectum, having for their object the detection of
tumors or morbid growths, are procedures which have fallen into merited
disrepute, and are mentioned here in condemnation.However, some years
since, Morton, in consultation with (J. Forsythe) Meigs, satisfactorily
demonstrated the absence of a suspected renal calculus by this method.The distension of the rectum with water, either free or contained in a
rubber bag, in order to facilitate operations upon the pelvic viscera,
has been lately brought into notice by Garson at a meeting of the
British Medical Association.The most significant point brought out at
the meeting was that the water-distended rectum displaced the distended
urinary bladder upward and forward until it occupied a position quite
outside of the pelvic cavity, carrying along with it the peritoneum
both in front and behind.By this method of distension it was found
possible so to raise the peritoneum in front of the bladder as to leave
a clear working space of four centimeters between the upper border of
the symphysis pubis and the edge of the peritoneum: this may prove
useful in suprapubic lithotomy, as well as in operations upon the
uterus and its appendages during laparotomy.RESUME OF THE THERAPEUTICAL AND SURGICAL TREATMENT.FISSURE OF THE ANUS, in its true sense, is not to be confounded with
ulcerations either slight and superficial in extent, or with more grave
ulcerations involving not only the anus, but the mucous membrane of the
{912} rectum also.The true fissure is a mere linear crack or abrasion
or superficial ulceration.The pain accompanying this condition is out
of proportion to the length and depth of the fissure, varying from
slight uneasiness to as severe suffering as that caused by a deep and
extensive ulceration.The treatment to be adopted in such cases is first to regulate the
bowels and to insist upon a scrupulous cleansing of the part after each
evacuation.Much sitting is to be avoided and a sedentary mode of life
is to be discouraged.Sometimes a few light topical applications of the
solid nitrate of silver will bring about a cure, or a lotion of the
same of the strength of from two to ten grains to the ounce of water
should be applied with a camel's-hair brush every other morning.The
ointment of the oxide of zinc, combined with any of the local
anaesthetics, will be found useful.As a dernier ressort in obstinate
cases an incision should be made through the fissure, together with a
thorough dilatation of the anal sphincter.ULCER OF THE RECTUM, OR THE GRAVER FORM OF FISSURE OF THE ANUS.--In the
milder forms of this very common and painful affection the treatment
consists in thorough cleanliness of the part; the ulcerated surface may
be cauterized with nitrate of silver, and subsequently the application
of the red precipitate ointment or the lotio nigra.Should a vaginal
discharge exist, treatment should be instituted with a view to its
arrest, as the irritating fluid coming in contact with the ulcer would
prevent its healing.The treatment of that variety of ulceration where
the disease is situated partly without the anus and partly within the
rectum, besides the use of the means enumerated above, embraces the
daily introduction of a full-sized bougie made of wax or of yellow
soap.Henry Hartshorne says: "Experience leads me to have especial
confidence in collodion, to which one-fiftieth of glycerin has been
added to lessen its constricting effect."Glycerite of tannin and
tinct.J. C. Peters[39] recommends the
use of iodoform suppositories.Tarnier[40] dusts the part with the same
drug in fine powder.Crequy[41] has had success with a dressing of
charpie saturated in a solution of hydrate of chloral.For the more
extensive and obstinate forms of ulceration the three methods of
treatment mainly relied on are--by cauterization, by dilatation, and by
incision.The caustics usually relied upon are the fuming nitric acid
and the acid nitrate of mercury, one application of either of these
often exciting healthy granulation.This application is to be followed
by the use of an ointment consisting of thirty grains of calomel and
three grains of morphia to one ounce of lard.If there is much spasm of
the sphincters, extract of belladonna may be added.[42] During this
treatment the bowels should be kept rather loose by the use of compound
licorice powder, and if much pain is experienced an opium suppository
should be used.Dilatation, first practised by Recamier, consists of
the introduction of the thumbs of the operator into the rectum, placing
them back to back, and then forcibly separating them from each other
until the sides of the bowel can be stretched out as far as the
tuberosities of the ischia.On account of the fact that both
cauterization and dilatation are not infrequently followed by relapse,
the method of operation which includes both incision and dilatation can
usually be relied {913} upon.The bowels should be thoroughly emptied
by a laxative, and an enema should be given three hours before the
operation.[Footnote 41: Ashton, _On the Rectum_, p.[Footnote 42: Agnew's _Surgery_, vol.After full anaesthesia the ulcer may be readily exposed.The left index
finger of the operator is then carried into the rectum, and a
sharp-pointed curved bistoury is entered, three-quarters of an inch or
more from the side of the anus, to the depth of an inch or less, and
carried on toward the bowel until the point is felt by the finger
within, when it is made to puncture the mucous membrane, and then to
cut out to the surface.In some cases of deep fissure, before dividing
the sphincter the ulcer may be scraped freely or the entire ulcer may
be removed.The anus should now be well dilated with the fingers, after
which an opium suppository should be introduced and a fragment of lint
or linen well oiled be placed in the wound.The subsequent treatment
consists in keeping the patient in a recumbent position and confining
the bowels with opium.After three or four days a laxative may be
given.No dressing is necessary save attention to cleanliness.The subcutaneous division of the sphincter has been proposed, but is
objected to on account of the liability of the extravasated blood
retained in the very loose cellular tissue of the part to form abscess.In one case which Morton operated upon in this manner many years ago a
large abscess formed very rapidly, with serious constitutional
symptoms, which were relieved only after the freest opening and
division of the sphincter.Should any polypi be found, their removal by ligation or by the knife
is an essential element of success in the operation; retention of urine
is not infrequent after operations upon fissure.When fissure or
ulceration makes its appearance in a syphilitic subject, it will
usually disappear under appropriate constitutional treatment.TUBERCULOUS ULCER OF THE ANUS is best treated by the topical use of a
weak solution of chloral hydrate.CHRONIC ULCER OF THE RECTUM.--In this condition the treatment should
include the use of anodyne and astringent lotions, suppositories or
enemata, and the internal administration of Ward's paste--_i.e._
confection of black pepper.RODENT ULCER OF RECTUM.--In this rather rare, exceeding painful, and
generally incurable malady the patient sometimes dies merely from the
exhaustion of pain.Another mode of death is by diarrhoea; another by
hemorrhage.To quote Allingham:[43] "I have really nothing to offer as
regards treatment; all the various sedatives will be required in their
turn, and in the earlier stage I should recommend excision--not that I
have much hope that you will eradicate the malady, but you will remove
the pain, and for some time the sufferer will be comparatively
comfortable.I think also the application of fuming nitric acid should
be tried with the same object; one of my patients was fairly easy for
three months after I had destroyed the ulcer with the acid."Morton
accomplished the permanent healing of an undoubted rodent ulcer of the
rectum by the complete divulsion of all the involved tissues.CANCER OF THE RECTUM.--The medical treatment of this affection is
necessarily restricted to efforts to alleviate suffering and to obtain
sleep--anodynes in the form of suppositories of pil.hyoscyamus in the proportion of a half
grain of the {914} salt to ten grains of the extract.Enemata of warm
water are useful.D'Arpene of Elba has suggested enemata of gastric
juice.The profuse discharge of sanious pus must be met by weak
injection of sulphate of copper and opium or a very dilute solution of
chloride of zinc.Now, as to the use of bougies in these cases, it may
be laid down as a general rule that their employment may be
mischievous, yet in certain cases justifiable--indeed, absolutely
necessary.When the disease is met with in its early stage, has not
ulcerated, is within reach of the finger, and is producing much
contraction of the calibre of the gut, a gum-elastic bougie, thoroughly
lubricated, may be introduced through the contraction.In case this
produces much suffering, the attempt must be abandoned; if not, once or
twice a week is often enough.Where no extensive ulceration exists the
patient can be much helped by this procedure.F. N. Otis[44] has
reported a case of malignant stricture in which he completely divided
the recto-vaginal septum, sphincter ani, and perineum with great
temporary relief to his patient.When large portions of a malignant
mass protrude from the anus, they may be removed by the application of
a paste of arsenite of copper or by the elastic ligature, the
destruction being safe and rapid.The injection of acetic acid into
these growths has been practised, but is useless and harmful.As to operative procedure, when the morbid growth is an epithelioma
situated within a short distance of the anal opening an excision is not
only justifiable, but may be recommended.The results show that its
removal from this situation is as frequently successful as is its
removal from the lip.When a cancer completely fills the lumen of the
gut and plugs it so that the act of defecation becomes impossible,
excision of the rectum and the establishment of an artificial anus are
the two operative procedures open to the choice of the surgeon.A
decided reaction of opinion has lately taken place among members of the
profession relative to the latter of these; the few surgeons who did
practise excision of the rectum in cases of cancer were looked upon as
being rather unscientific and unsurgical.Billroth has excised the
rectum 16 times, with 4 fatal cases; Dieffenbach performed it 30 times;
Lisfranc had recourse to this operation as early as 1826; while the
operation has been performed very frequently in this country, and with
success.Morton says: "In the spring of 1882, I was consulted in the case of a
lady aged fifty-six who had suffered for two years from what were
supposed to be internal hemorrhoids.An examination revealed the
existence of a large scirrhous mass encircling about two-thirds of the
gut, on the anterior part especially, and extending upward three
inches.The patient was worn down by long suffering, but was otherwise
in fair condition of health.With the assistance of Gross and Agnew, I
excised the mass, which included the entire lower part of the rectum.The wound healed kindly, without an untoward symptom, and the patient
was very soon enabled to leave her home for the seaside, where she
passed the summer.The disease, however, resumed, but without any of
the severe pains which she had had prior to the operation.Death
occurred from gradual exhaustion seven months afterward."He also relates the following case of excision of the rectum: The
patient, a female aged thirty-five years, first noticed some rectal
{915} irritation about four years ago.This was followed by distressing
pain during defecation and by hemorrhages; finally a tumor, which was
described by her medical attendant as being like an opened umbrella,
protruded, partly at first, then fully, through the anus.The growth
seemed to be spongy in character, and was very vascular.It was removed
by carrying a double-threaded needle through the mass, and thus
ligating it.Upon the seventh day after the operation a hemorrhage
occurred, which was controlled by plugging the rectum.Although the
growth was removed, the patient did not make a good recovery; symptoms
of rectal irritation continued.In September, 1884, the patient
presented herself in a wretched condition, with bearing-down pains and
frequent hemorrhages.Upon digital examination an elevated mass was
readily detected upon the sacral aspect of the bowel.By carrying the
fingers beyond this mass and making traction, it was brought down
within working distance, and was excised along with the entire lower
portion of the rectum.The freshly-cut edges of the gut were then drawn
down and stitched to the mucous membrane just above the anus.The
patient made a good recovery and has a serviceable anus.R. J. Levis[45] has operated upon two cases of cancerous growth in the
rectum, removing the lower part of the bowel.The first case was that
of a man aged sixty, who made a very good recovery from the successful
operation, although three inches of the gut were removed.The second
case was that of a man aged fifty-two, who had a carcinomatous tumor
the size of a hen's egg at the right side of the rectum.The section of
gut excised was about one and a half inches in length.The patient died
of peritonitis upon the fourth day after operation.At the autopsy
there was no wound found in the peritoneum, the lowest point of which
was one inch above the end of the excised bowel.[Footnote 45: _Surgery in the Pennsylvania Hospital_, pp.The etherized patient, his bladder having been emptied, should be
placed in the lithotomy position.If a male, a sound should be passed
into the bladder.An incision is then carried from the centre of the
perineum along the raphe to the anterior margin of the anus, encircling
the latter by two semicircular cuts and continuing the division
directly back to the coccyx.In the female the incision should begin
just posterior to the vagina.If the anus is not included in the
diseased mass, the external sphincter may be spared by raising the skin
and the muscle together and turning them on each side.When the lower
end of the rectum is reached the dissection should be made entirely by
the fingers or by the handle of the knife, tying vessels as they
spring.Double ligatures should be introduced through the gut from its
mucous surface outward, and, when possible, then stitched to the skin
at the margins of the wound.The bowels should be controlled by opium
for the following eight or ten days.The other operative procedure is lumbar colotomy.This was first
advocated by Amussat in 1839, when he appeared in a treatise upon the
subject entitled _On the Possibility of Establishing an Artificial Anus
in the Lumbar Region_.It is denied that he ever performed this
operation.It has happened to sound surgeons and skilful operators,
when the patient has been very muscular or very fat or when the colon
has been collapsed, that they have been at length compelled to abandon
the search for the gut {916} and to stitch up the external wound.Allingham states that the cause of failure often is that the colon is
searched for too far from the spine, resulting, in the opening of the
peritoneum, in the starting up into the wound of a mass of small
intestine which baffles the operator very seriously.He, having made
more than fifty dissections, has come to this conclusion: "that the
descending colon is always normally situated half an inch posterior to
the centre of the crest of the ileum (the centre being the point midway
between the anterior, superior, and posterior-superior spinous
processes)."An incision four inches in length should be made midway
between the last rib and the crest of the ileum.The incision may be
made transverse, or, better, obliquely downward and forward, as
suggested by Bryant.Allingham says that care should be taken to
preserve the original length of the incision down through all
structures, lest when the operator approaches the gut he finds himself
working in the apex of a triangle the base of which is the line of the
wound.If the surgeon has reason to expect the gut to be collapsed, an
attempt should be made to distend it with some fluid.The intestine
should be drawn well out through the wound, and a longitudinal opening
an inch in length made in it.The edges of this are to be stitched to
the edges of the skin.Fecal matter is much less likely to flow into
the wound if the sutures are passed through the intestine previous to
opening it.A weak carbolated wash is all that is required as a
dressing.In one case of stricture of the rectum from a scirrhous mass,
in which Morton performed colotomy, an immense cyst of the kidney,
which was somewhat puzzling for a moment, protruded in the wound.After
emptying the cyst the gut was readily discovered and opened.DILATATION AND INFLAMMATION OF THE RECTAL POUCHES.--This is a
comparatively rare condition of the rectum, called by Physick encysted
rectum, which is treated by bending the end of a probe into a hook,
passing it up into the bowel, and then withdrawing it with its
extremity resting against the surface, so as to engage and draw down
the pouches, the straining or bearing down of the patient assisting in
their extrusion; they may then be incised or cut off with a pair of
curved scissors.LOSS OF CO-ORDINATION IN THE MUSCLES OF DEFECATION.--In those cases
where it can be ascertained that this curious trouble is not
symptomatic, sympathetic, nor reflex, the treatment must be directed to
the building up of the general health, such as electricity, baths,
asafoetida, and iron.SPHINCTERISMUS.--This condition, though frequently attendant upon, may
exist in the absence of, any fissure, crack, or ulcer of the anus.In its treatment magnesia and
rhubarb are to be used, and the diet must be simple, unstimulating, and
taken at regular intervals.A hot hip-bath at night, with the use of a
belladonna suppository, often proves effective.In more obstinate cases
a bougie covered with ointment of belladonna should be used daily.In
still more intractable cases the muscle must be forcibly stretched with
the fingers.In the more obstinate cases which now and then occur it
becomes necessary to completely divide the fibres of the sphincter
muscle, followed by a thorough stretching of the parts.{917} PRURITUS ANI.--This distressing and vexatious complaint proceeds
frequently from hemorrhoids.When caused by the presence of seat-worms,
they must be dislodged by purgatives and enemata of quassia or of one
composed of one part of carbolic acid to six parts of sweet oil, or of
turpentine and flaxseed tea.An enema of milk of asafoetida answers a
good purpose.If the pruritus is a result of the burrowing of the itch
insect, any wash, ointment, or dressing that evolves sulphuretted
hydrogen will rapidly bring relief.If caused by other parasites, an
application of ung.or red precipitate ointment, followed by a
warm bath, will be all that is necessary.In some it is a symptom of
dyspepsia, in others of a disordered state of the nerves of the anus
independent of local cause: in this case iron, quinia, and arsenic
should be given, and the patient should live an outdoor life as much as
possible.The remedies that have in turn been extolled and abandoned
during the treatment of this distressing condition it would require too
much space to even mention.The following are among the best: Sulphate
of zinc and alum, equal parts, are to be placed in an earthen vessel
and heated until a glassy mass is left, which is to be dissolved in a
little water and thrown into the bowel; palm soap pressed into the
anus, ointments of carbolic acid and morphia or of bromide of potassium
and cosmoline, citrine and other mercurial ointments, and suppositories
containing iodoform.Allingham uses a bone or a metallic plug of
peculiar construction, so as to keep the anus upon the stretch at night
without slipping into the bowel.The pressure which this exerts upon
the nerves and vessels prevents the itching.Hot (not warm) water
pressed against the anus with a sponge, or ten-drop doses internally of
tincture of gelsemium, or washes of dilute hydrocyanic acid or of
chloroform, or ointments of balsam of Peru or of veratria and aconitia,
or the corrosive chloride of mercury in solution applied locally, are a
few of the more reliable among this host.STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM (NON-MALIGNANT).--The main modes of treatment
of non-malignant stricture of the rectum are two--by dilatation or by
linear incision (rectotomy).Dilatation may be practised by the finger
alone or by the finger covered with hollow rubber covers of various
sizes.These are open at the end, so that the guiding and recognizing
sense of touch may be left to the end of the finger.When the stricture
is out of reach of this method, either gum or metallic bougies must be
used, beginning with the smaller sizes and deliberately and carefully
adding sizes.When the lumen of a stricture is tortuous it is best to
use a long rather flexible rubber bougie having an olive-shaped
extremity.It is not necessary to leave these bougies standing for
hours in a stricture, according to the practice of some; this merely
excites inflammation.Should the stricture be irritable, every second
or third day would be sufficiently often to attempt dilatation.In
constrictions which are firm, but not sensitive, a good plan is to
insert a Molesworth elastic tube and gradually distend it by
hydrostatic pressure; Barnes's dilators have also been successfully
used.When the stricture is elastic and re-forms itself at once after
dilatation, incision should be practised.In those strictures which are
low down, the constriction may be nicked in several places by a hernia
knife, the blade of which is guided along a finger in the bowel; when
high up, a long double-bladed knife must be employed.In syphilitic
strictures, in addition to dilatation, proper alterative treatment is
{918} indispensable.As dilatation has often to be kept up for a long
time, the patient may be taught to practise this for himself.PERI-ANAL AND PERI-RECTAL ABSCESS.--When acute, and when the surgeon is
called in time, the prompt application of leeches may abort the
abscess, but usually, by the time the surgeon sees it, it is necessary
to apply hot flaxseed poultices as fast as they become cool, keeping
the patient in bed upon light diet.The rule is to open deeply and
freely so soon as the least softening under the poultices indicates
that pus is within reach.After lancing, the poultices should be
continued for a few days: then the deep wound should be packed with a
strip of oiled lint and allowed to granulate from the bottom.As the
fetor of these abscesses is horrible, they should be injected with a
solution of permanganate of potash or liq.When the
chronic variety of this abscess is discovered, it, with all its
sinuses, diverticula, and pockets, should be laid freely open upon a
director and packed with carbolized lint.It is often very necessary in
these chronic cases to use tonic and alterative treatment, such as
cod-liver oil and iodide of iron.GONORRHOEA OF THE RECTUM.--Undoubted cases of gonorrhoea of the rectum
in the persons of prostitutes have been observed.Burning heat and
great pain are usually felt, with a free discharge of pure pus: the
mucous membrane is always intensely inflamed.The treatment is simple;
an injection of lead-water and laudanum or of sulphate of zinc answers
a good purpose.Primary syphilitic disease of the anus and rectum is
rarely seen, but of course the treatment indicated would be similar to
that laid down for primary syphilis in its usual localities.IMPACTION OF FECES.--This condition usually occurs among the aged and
in women after parturition and in cases of paralysis.Those persons of
sedentary habits who do not pay sufficient attention to the necessity
of a daily alvine evacuation sometimes find themselves in this
condition.Impaction occurs not infrequently among the insane, and more
frequently among women than men.Allingham states that he has never
seen a case of impaction in a young person; but Wetherill now has under
his care a most obstinate case of this disorder in a young man whose
system has been completely broken down by intemperance in drink.In paralysis of the rectum of traumatic origin impaction is almost
certain to take place unless great care is taken to prevent it.Diarrhoea is a very misleading element in these cases, and is a symptom
which frequently deceives those who are not on their guard.The clayey
mass of feculent matter forms a hard ball in the distended bowel,
around which the small loose passages flow.Spasm of the sphincter ani
is the usual accompaniment of impaction, and the muscle should be
gently but thoroughly dilated before means can be used to free the
canal.The finger or the handle of a tablespoon is best to use in the
dislodgment of these masses, and should be oiled before introduction,
the accumulation broken up, and then washed out by an enema of soap,
turpentine, and warm water.Purgatives and hydragogue cathartics
usually fail to give relief, and add much to the patient's discomfort.The bowel once freed, care must be taken to prevent a reaccumulation,
which very readily takes place, as the bowel in these cases is
distended and has lost tone.To this end frequent enemata of cold water
should be used, and the patient should {919} take a pill of dried
sulphate of iron, sulphate of quinia, extract of nux vomica, extract of
aloes, as recommended by Allingham.An
excellent adjunct to this treatment is the local use of the faradic
galvanic current daily after breakfast.Let the patient lie upon a bed
and apply one pole or electrode to the anus, while the other one is
passed with pressure along the course of the large intestine.Not
infrequently it happens after this has been continued for a few minutes
that a very urgent desire is felt to go to stool.In the case mentioned
of the young man affected with impaction this treatment answered
admirably well, but before its use he had to take a small dose of
croton oil daily to cause an action of the bowels, all milder measures
having proved ineffectual.It is important in these cases to interdict
a sedentary mode of life.IRRITABLE RECTUM.--A rectum is said to be irritable when it shows an
intolerance of the presence of feces or flatus, causing frequent desire
to go to stool.From such abnormal activity of the part there arise a
burning, uncomfortable impression of fulness and a soreness of the
anus.If after examination it is found that there is no local exciting
cause, a starch enema containing forty drops of laudanum should be
given and retained.Should the irritability prove to be obstinate, examine the rectum, and
if a spot of redness or increased vascularity be found, touch the spot
with strong nitric acid.CONCRETIONS IN THE RECTUM.--These occur less frequently than do
impactions, and differ from them in being cylindrical and nucleated,
the nuclei being such bodies as balls or tangled masses of hair, or
coins, buttons, biliary calculi, or the like.Covering these are matted
animal or vegetable fibres or hardened fecal matter.They are not so
readily dislodged as are impactions, and it is necessary to dilate the
sphincter thoroughly and remove them with a scoop.Not infrequently
these bodies are bathed in pus and are very fetid.PROCTITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE RECTUM.--This may be either acute or
chronic, the latter being a disease of the aged.Allingham recommends
in this variety small doses of Barbadoes aloes to stimulate the bowel,
also such drugs as copaiba, turpentine, and black pepper.As an
injection in the acute form starch and laudanum, or bismuth suspended
in a mucilaginous vehicle, should be used.Probably the use of small,
smooth fragments of ice in the rectum would allay the tenesmus and help
to subdue the inflammation.PROLAPSUS ANI AND PROCIDENTIA.--Prolapsus occurs much more frequently
in children than in adults, making its appearance at every movement of
the bowels.The child thus affected should not be allowed to sit upon
the chamber-vessel and strain, but should lie upon the side or stand,
while the nurse should be instructed to draw to one side one of the
buttocks so as to tighten the anal orifice.After the motion the
protruded part should be well washed in cold water, and afterward with
some astringent solution of oak-bark, matico, or a weak solution of
carbolic acid applied with a soft sponge.The bowel should then be
gently returned and the child be allowed to lie at rest for a while.If
there exists intestinal irritation, small doses of mercury with chalk,
with rhubarb at night, with wine of iron three times daily, would be
indicated.{920} The application of an anal pad and a T-bandage will
give sufficient support.If this treatment be carried out a cure
usually results in a few weeks.Some cases do not yield to this mode,
and then the surgeon has to make trial of ergotin given hypodermically,
each injection representing a grain of ergot, which is to be thrown
into the submucous tissue of the rectum every second day for two weeks.Should relief not follow its use, cauterization is to be tried.The
cauterants usually applied are nitrate of silver, acid nitrate of
mercury, and nitric acid.Of these, nitric acid is the best.After
anaesthesia is complete every portion of the extrusion should be
touched with the acid, care being taken not to bring it into contact
with the skin; afterward the bowel is to be freely oiled and returned.To prevent its extrusion the bowel should be filled with soft cotton
wool, a compress placed over the anus, and the buttocks strapped
tightly together with adhesive plaster.For a general quieting effect
the child should be given paregoric.About the fourth day the adhesive
plaster may be removed and a dose of castor oil administered, which
will bring away the cotton plug with the dejection.Prolapsus and procidentia in the adult are much less manageable;
indeed, these conditions are usually very obstinate.There may exist
causes extraneous to the bowel, such as urethral stricture or enlarged
prostate or an impacted renal calculus or a calculus of the prostate.The bowel should be searched for polypi or hemorrhoids, and the
prolapse may be cured by the removal of the irritating cause.Failing
to find any such cause, the surgeon has at his command either
cauterization or a removal of redundancy.The former may be by nitrate
of silver or acid nitrate of mercury or the actual cautery.It is well
not to apply these strong acids to the aged or those who are broken
down in health, as very destructive sloughing has followed their use in
these cases.When these are used, the same plan as that mentioned in
case of prolapse in children should be pursued.Strong carbolic acid
may be used in these cases with much less risk of sloughing than when
the acid is employed, and it may be applied oftener--indeed, daily if
desirable.Van Buren has recommended linear cauterization with the hot
iron to the mucous membrane, the bowel contracting as a result of
cicatrization.In adults generally, and especially in the aged, all the
forms of cauterization are less satisfactory as a means of relief than
either of the various modifications of Copeland's operation, which
consists in removing by ligation elliptical portions of the mucous and
submucous tissues of the prolapsed bowel.The most satisfactory of
these is either to excise two or three oval portions of the mucous
membrane with flat-curved scissors and bring the edges together with
interrupted suture, or to pinch up in several places the redundancy in
a Smith's clamp and cut off the folds in advance of the instrument,
applying to the stumps the hot iron.Allingham prefers ligatures of
horsehair in these operations, and mentions the carbolized catgut in
preference to silk.He cautions the operator not to carry his knife
into the submucous tissue, as free hemorrhage would inevitably occur.In old cases of prolapsus or of procidentia that are not amenable to
operative treatment much can be done to render them comfortable: the
air-dilated gum pessary will sometimes afford relief, or a pad and
T-bandage will prevent the parts becoming ulcerated by friction.Neither gallic {921} nor tannic acid answers the purpose so well as
acorn flour.The frequent use of cold water to the part is always
attended with comfort, and sometimes with relief.In these old cases of
great relaxation Nelaton has used strychnia by the mouth, and Weber (of
New York) hypodermically, with fair result.Vidal has cured three cases
by the repeated use of ergotin locally, hypodermically.In order to
bring about a radical cure in these very chronic cases, very decided
means sometimes are justifiable.Hey of Leeds was the
first to propose a plan by which, through cicatricial contraction and
inflammatory gluing together of the various tissues composing the
bowel, the anus and sphincter muscle might be strengthened and improved
in tone; to which end he proposed to cut away the pendulous flaps of
skin around the anus.In cases where these flaps are very redundant a
cure is sometimes effected by this procedure alone.Other cases will be
benefited by the operation proposed by Dupuytren, which consists in the
removal of radiating folds of the skin and mucous membrane at the edge
of the anus.To quote from Holmes's _System of Surgery_: "This
operation is effected by laying hold of the fold of skin on each side
of the anus with forceps, then with a sharp curved pair of scissors
removing both skin and mucous membrane.In very severe cases four or
six applications of the scissors may be necessary."POLYPUS OF THE RECTUM.--The polypi of the rectum are the gelatinoid and
the fibroid, but as a very rare occurrence a villous or warty polypus
has been found.Polypoid growths are very different bodies, but they
are too frequently confounded with true polypi.The only treatment is
their removal, and the safest method is by ligation of the pedicle, and
either cutting off the growth in advance of the knot or returning it
into the bowel.The patient should remain quiet until the sloughing is
complete, and his bowels must be confined, otherwise profuse and very
troublesome hemorrhage might ensue.Their removal by the clamp and
cautery is equally safe.Their removal by torsion or by the scissors is
unsafe.The peculiar villous polypus causes great and exhausting hemorrhage.A
case was successfully treated by the application of fuming nitric acid.FISTULA IN ANO.--In the palliative treatment of this very common malady
no great amount of relief can be afforded.Those who are aged and
feeble or those who are much broken down will find comfort to attend
the free local use of warm water, and the sinuses should be injected
with dilute solutions of one of the mineral astringents, the strength
of these not exceeding two grains to the fluidounce of water.Cosmoline, simple cerate, ointment of the oxide of zinc, and even fresh
lard, make the patient easier, as they prevent friction of the
buttocks.One of the forms of the radical treatment consists in the
division of all the structures between the fistulous tract and the
surface.This may be accomplished either by the use of the knife or by
seton.Stimulating injections or cauterization has been known
occasionally to permanently close fistulae in ano; but such plans of
treatment are unreliable, and usually unjustifiable.When the fistula
is not so high up in the bowel as to render the use of the knife
unsafe, this plan of treatment should be adopted.As an invariable
preliminary to all operations upon the rectum the bowels should be
thoroughly emptied and the patient should be placed under the influence
of {922} an anaesthetic.A flexible grooved director should then be
carried through the opening of the tract upon the surface and along the
tract to its opening in the bowel, should such exist.The forefinger
within the rectum will meet the point of the director as it emerges
from the internal opening, and the director should be pushed onward and
its extremity guided outward until it rests fairly upon the sound
integument outside, and all the included structures should be divided
along the groove of the director with a sharp-pointed curved bistoury.Should the fore finger in the rectum not discover an internal opening,
one should be forced at the very bottom of the tract by rotating the
point of the director while making counter-pressure with the end of the
finger.Should several fistulae be found, they should be treated in
like manner.Sometimes it will be found that the incision is overlapped
by the dusky-red flaps composing its margins, in which case they should
be trimmed off with scissors.When the tract extends deeper than its
internal opening, the latter should be ignored and the sinus laid open
to its very bottom.When no external opening exists, one should be
made, and the guide for this incision will be a point of induration
felt by the finger at some point not far from the surface.The director
entering at this point will find the tract, and should be pushed
forward as described above.These opened sinuses should be packed with
lint soaked in carbolized oil and confined by a pad and a T-bandage.It
is the practice at the Pennsylvania Hospital to apply after division a
stick of caustic potassa, allowing it to remain in contact with the cut
surfaces for several seconds, after which the wounds are to be packed.The bowels should
be confined for a few days, after which a dose of oil may be given.Besides attention to cleanliness and a daily renewing of the packing no
further treatment will be demanded.The hemorrhage attending these
operations is usually trifling.Should a vessel spring, a ligature may
be thrown around it.When an abundant general oozing occurs, the rectum
must be packed and a compress and bandage firmly applied.Should the
surgeon prefer the seton operation, he should carry several threads of
stout silk or a piece of rubber cord on an eyed probe into the fistula
and out of its internal opening, and by tying their ends firmly down
upon the enclosed tissues slowly effect the same result as in the
cutting operation.When the seton used is silk, the ends should be
carried through holes in a round leaden plate or through those of an
ordinary button, and tied.These setons are to be drawn tighter every
three or four days until the division of the enclosed tissues is
complete.The subsequent treatment is the same as in the other
operation.A difference of opinion exists among surgeons as to the propriety of
operating for fistula in ano in persons afflicted with tubercular
disease of the lungs.The practice of the present day is decidedly in
favor of operating, without reference to the condition of the lungs,
provided the patient is not too much reduced in strength.An operation for fistula in ano has been proposed and practised by
Reeves, which is a compromise between cutting and ligation.He says:
"It consisted in passing a strong and well-waxed silk ligature along
the track of the fistula into the bowel.An ordinary surgical probe
with an eye in its end carried this thread into the rectum.My bivalve
expanding speculum was previously introduced, and by its use there was
no difficulty {923} in seeing and seizing the ligature and bringing it
out through the anus.The probe was then withdrawn, and the ends of the
silk were wound round two strong pieces of wood which were held between
the fingers of each hand.An assistant passed a finger on either side
of the track of the fistula to steady the tissues and to resist the
traction which was put on the silk thread.The two pieces of wood were
then drawn toward me with a rapid sawing motion, and the fistula was
quickly divided, with the loss of scarcely any blood.Some oiled lint
and a pad and bandage were applied in the usual way; and the wound
healed well.No anaesthetic was administered, and although the patient
did not relish the operation, still it was quite bearable, and what she
felt most was a burning sensation, due, doubtless, to the friction of
the silk."HEMORRHOIDS.--The treatment of this form of rectal and anal disease is
either medical or surgical according to the gravity of the case and
according to the obstinacy with which it resists local and general
therapeutic agents.An ordinary acute attack of external piles, such as
is often produced by neglect of the bowels, causing constipation, may
be treated in the following manner: The patient should rest and avoid
stimulating food and beverages.He should employ cold bathing to the
part frequently: indeed, great comfort and relief often follow this
treatment alone.An ointment of tannic acid, glycerin, and simple
cerate, or one containing calomel and extract of opium, will be found
useful.Fresh lard, cosmoline, vaseline, cold cream, ointment of the
oxide of zinc (benzoated) or an ointment containing extract of opium,
extract of galls, and extract of belladonna or stramonium, are some
among many agents that have been extolled for their relief.H. C.
Wood[46] recommends enemata of solution of chlorate of potassium and
laudanum.Enemata of lime-water and linseed oil are recommended by
Agnew: "One of the very best formulas for allaying the irritation
incident to hemorrhoidal affections consists of the following
combination: Acetate of lead and tannin, of each fifteen grains;
carbonate of lead and extract of stramonium, of each thirty grains;
creasote, five drops.With a sufficient quantity of cocoa-butter mould
this into fifty suppositories."[47] The internal exhibition of the
balsam of copaiba, twenty drops in capsules taken four or five times
daily, or the use of fifteen drops of liquor potassa rubbed up with
half a drachm of the balsam into emulsion, taken three times a day, has
been much extolled, as has also the confection of black pepper.Sometimes these various means will cure a chronic or long-standing case
of piles, either internal or external.Wetherill has found that the
topical application of rectified oil of amber has cured long-standing
cases of piles.This oil should not be applied in cases where much
inflammation exists, and where the piles are internal the best mode of
bringing it in contact with them is to incorporate from three to five
minims of the oil with sufficient cocoa-butter to make a suppository.One of these, pushed into the bowel night and morning for a week, will
not infrequently cause the piles to shrink up and finally to disappear.The bowels should be kept open with the compound powder of licorice.It
should be remembered that magnesia irritates hemorrhoids.Success has
followed the internal use of ergotin, of the fluid extract of hamamelis
virginica, of the corn blast (ustilago maidis), and of small doses of
aloes combined with hyoscyamus.{924} D. Young has had good results
follow the internal use of glycerin.Chronic cases of piles have been
cured by the application of ointments containing carbonate of lead,
creasote, carbolic acid, or iodoform.Ergotin used hypodermically in
the vicinity of the anus or injected into the piles has frequently
resulted in a complete cure, and the same may be said of the injection
of carbolic acid directly into the tumors.In the application of cold
water to inflamed piles it should be borne in mind that its forcible
impingement upon them in a fine stream acts far more efficiently than
the mere bathing them.Some cases do better under the use of warm water
or warm sedative and astringent lotions.A warm flaxseed poultice mixed
with laudanum is a very comfortable application.In obstinate cases of
prolapse Agnew[48] recommends the use of a rectal obturator or the use
of a hemorrhoidal truss.[Footnote 47: _Surgery in the Pennsylvania Hospital_, p.[Footnote 48: Agnew's _Surgery_, vol.Those who suffer from prolapse of piles should avoid the habitual use
of cushioned seats.They should assume a semi-erect posture during
defecation, or, when this is attended with difficulty or inconvenience,
they should contrive a portable water-closet seat by boring a hole an
inch and a half in diameter through a piece of planed board, bevelling
it so as to fit the person.These means will often prevent the
extrusion of the tumors.After defecation the patient should rest for a
little while in the recumbent attitude.The careful touching of external piles with strong nitric acid is a
mode of treatment that has been quite successful in the hands of some
surgeons.The intolerable itching of these bodies can be allayed by
touching them with tincture of aconite-root or with a concentrated
tincture of prickly-ash bark.Freezing them with the ether spray allays
the pain and itching for the time being, but these symptoms return with
redoubled energy after the effect has subsided.Should an attack of the external variety of piles not result in
absorption, but leave an excrescence, painless but inconvenient, and
liable at any time to become inflamed, excision would be in order.Divide the integument by an incision radiating from the anus, separate
the skin from the tumor down to its base, and after seizing it with
toothed forceps cut it off with scissors curved on the flat.Little
flaps or tabs of skin remaining after piles may be snipped off with
scissors.It is not well to operate upon external piles unless they
obstinately resist all milder treatment.There are frequently venous
enlargements containing blood-clot, and when this condition exists
proceed as follows: Pinch up the little tumor between the thumb and
finger of the left hand; transfix its base with a curved bistoury, and
cut out; at the same time, by pressure with the thumb and finger,
extrude the clot.Fill the bottom of the little sac with cotton wool,
and the operation is complete.It is not necessary in these cases to
wait until the inflammation subsides before operating.The operative treatment of the internal variety may be by
strangulation, by the cautery, by the ecraseur, and by the use of
caustics.The former of these is the safest and most convenient method,
and the one usually employed in the Pennsylvania Hospital, and should
be performed in the following manner: The lower bowel having been
thoroughly evacuated and the patient etherized, the operator should
gently but firmly stretch the sphincter.The patient should be placed
upon the side, with {925} the upper part of the body prone, the hips
elevated, and the thighs flexed upon the abdomen.Transfix the largest
tumor with a strong, long-handled tenaculum, cut through the skin at
the base with a knife or scissors around its external half, and hand
the hook to an assistant, instructing him to make gentle traction.Then
encircle the mass with a stout cord if the mass is not too large, or
pass a stout needle threaded with a double silk ligature, from without
inward, deeply through the base of the pile, drawing it through the
mucous membrane on the opposite side; cut loose the needle and tie
tightly, so as to completely strangulate the included tissues on either
side and leave the ends of the ligature long.Treat all the remaining
tumors in a similar manner seriatim, and then with scissors cut away
the strangulated bodies to within a safe distance of the ligatures, the
ends of which are now to be cut off close.Place an opium suppository
in the bowel, and the operation is complete.When for any sufficiently good reason the patient will not bear the
ordinary anaesthetics, it will become necessary to modify the operation
as follows: The tumors having been well extruded by enema of warm water
or by the efforts of the patient, bend him forward over a chair and
direct an assistant to draw aside the buttocks.Then pass the double
ligatures as before indicated, but refrain from tying until all the
tumors are thus secured, as the operator will find it convenient to
draw upon the ligatures to keep the mass of piles within view and
working-distance.Then draw down each tumor, cut around its base, and
tie as before; cut off the ends of the ligatures and the greater
portion of each strangulated tumor, and return everything within the
bowel, and follow with an opium suppository.In many cases Morton has
used the nitrous oxide gas with the best results.The hook should then
be withdrawn, and each knot should be drawn more firmly down prior to
its reduplication.Following this procedure, if properly carried out,
the tumors will change color, becoming blue, thus indicating complete
strangulation.The operation by the clamp and cautery is a good method when the
hemorrhoidal tumors are small.Cusack of
Dublin, and the clamp employed is that invented by Mr.This instrument is so well known that a detailed description of
it would be unnecessary.In operating with it the tumor is to be drawn
well out and the clamp applied close up to its attachment with the
bowel.Strangulation is effected by means of the screw which runs
through the shafts of the handles.This accomplished, the strangulated
portion is cut off with scissors, which should leave a stump
three-eighths of an inch long.To this stump apply the actual cautery
at a dull red heat, touching its every portion, after which unscrew and
remove the clamp and look for hemorrhage.Should any occur, touch the
bleeding point with the hot iron.Confine the patient to bed for five
or six days and give sufficient opium to confine the bowels.After this
time has elapsed administer a dose of oil.Remember that but one pile
should be clamped at one time."The taking two piles into the clamp at
once is sure to result in hemorrhage."Do not allow the cautery-iron to
touch the clamp.After the operation return the parts within the
sphincter and cut off any tabs of redundant integument with scissors.The removal of internal piles by means of the ecraseur was the favorite
operation of Chassaignac, but it is a mode of procedure which is now
{926} regarded with disfavor by the best surgeons on account of the
liability to hemorrhage, and from the fact that troublesome and
injurious contractions of the anus have not infrequently followed its
use.The employment of iron or copper wire instead of the usual chain
has been recommended by those who prefer this mode of operation.The
plan adopted by Chassaignac was to pedunculate the piles by tying a
ligature around the base and drawing them down.The chain being then
applied, the strangulation and crushing off was slowly accomplished by
means of the lever of the instrument.It should take from twenty to
twenty-five minutes' crushing to accomplish this object.For the treatment of internal piles by caustics Houston of Dublin used
strong nitric acid.A fenestrated speculum should be employed, and the
acid should be applied with a piece of wood or with a glass brush, care
being taken to limit its action to the tumors, the redundant liquid
being mopped up with a swab of lint or prepared absorbent cotton.The
entire surface should afterward be bathed in oil.The acid is relied
upon to produce a granulating surface, by the healing of which and by
the subsequent contraction a cure is sometimes achieved.At best, this
plan of treatment has proved tedious and unsatisfactory.Chloride of zinc and caustic potassa are even more unsatisfactory
agents for this purpose than the acid, as they are very violent in
local destruction and their action is very difficult to limit.The use
of caustic potassa was last revived by Amussat, but failed to find
favor from his contemporaries, and soon fell into merited disuse.Van
Buren says: "From recent experience with the thermo-cautery of
Paquelin, I am disposed to regard it as more manageable than nitric
acid, and at least equally efficient."Allingham mentions favorably the
strong carbolic acid as a substitute for the nitric as an application
to vascular and granular surfaces.The reckless method employed by the
older surgeons of cutting off internal piles with the knife or with
scissors, without any precautions against bleeding, is merely mentioned
in condemnation.Usually no serious symptoms are to be expected after
operations for hemorrhoids, but to this general rule there are
exceptions.Morton knows of two consecutive cases of tetanus after this
operation performed in a hospital in this city, and both terminated
fatally.One of the most common occurrences after the ligation of piles
is retention of urine, generally lasting for a day or two and requiring
the use of the catheter.HEMORRHAGE FROM THE RECTUM.--Bleeding from these parts is more usually
of a venous than an arterial character, but in some cases of
hemorrhoids the bleeding is either arterial or arterio-venous.The
latter occurs upon the detachment of a polypus, but not necessarily of
a polypoid growth.Arterial or mixed bleeding occurs in carcinoma and
in rodent ulcer, and also from the stumps of badly-occluded piles.In
cases of vicarious menstruation from the rectum the venous blood simply
oozes from the surface of the over-congested mucous membrane.This
condition should be readily diagnosed by the physical properties of the
blood and from the history of the patient.In almost all cases of
bleeding near the anus it will be possible to pick up the vessel or the
bleeding point on a tenaculum and ligate with silk, which is the most
satisfactory method to the surgeon.The rectum has been dragged down
with volsella forceps to apply a ligature to a point high up, but in
some of these cases the acupressure pin {927} with the twisted suture
will be found more convenient.Should hemorrhage occur after the
ligation of piles which cannot be checked by ligature, such as a
general oozing, pass all the ligatures through a hole made in the
centre of a small round sponge, then tie them across a piece of stick
(thus constructing a sort of tourniquet), and twist this around.Van
Buren cites a case in which a sudden laceration of the integument and
sphincter occurred during forcible dilatation in a case of hemorrhoids
in a very broken-down subject, with very copious hemorrhage.He passed
a sponge armed with a double ligature into the bowel, and, directing an
assistant to make traction upon the threads, the bleeding was checked.Injecting ice-water and perchloride of iron into the rectum will often
check hemorrhage.Allingham prefers the persulphate of iron to any
other styptic for this purpose.Passing fragments of ice into the bowel
while holding a lump of ice upon the sacrum sometimes answers a good
purpose.In many cases of secondary hemorrhage from large venous
sinuses in a state of ulceration it will be impossible to ligate, and
the use of the ordinary styptics will be but the waste of valuable
time: the bowel must be tamponed as follows: Thread a strong silk
ligature through near the apex of a cone-shaped sponge, and bring it
back again, so that the apex of the sponge is held in a loop of thread.Wet the sponge, squeeze it dry, and fill its meshes with ferric alum or
with persulphate of iron.Pass the left fore finger into the bowel, and
upon it push up the sponge, apex first, by means of a metal rod or any
other convenient body, fully five inches into the rectum.Now fill the
rectum below this with cotton-wool filled with the styptic.The bowel
having been completely filled, make traction upon the ligatures (thus
spreading out the bell-shaped sponge), while with the other hand push
up the packing.If this is carefully done no fear of bleeding need be
apprehended.In these cases the patient often suffers from collections
of flatus, which may be obviated at the time of packing by placing a
flexible catheter in the bowel and packing around it.These plugs
should remain for at least five or six days, and frequently eight or
ten days are none too long.The packing must then be picked carefully
away from the sponge.Agnew's rectal chemise answers the same purpose.In describing its application he says: "Through the openings at the end
of the largest-sized gum catheter pass a strong silk thread; take three
square pieces of the material usually known as mosquito-netting,
placing them one on top of the other; at the centre of these squares or
pieces make an opening, and pass the catheter through it, securing the
two together by the threads.In applying the instrument the different
layers of the chemise must be moistened with water, and afterward well
filled with the persulphate of iron.It is then conducted some distance
into the rectum on a finger previously inserted; after which it is
expanded like a parachute by packing between the catheter and its hood
with long strips of lint thrust up on the end of a bougie until the
bowel is distended on every side.The catheter will serve to conduct
away the flatus, and when, after eight or ten days, its removal becomes
necessary, this is very easily effected by drawing out the ribbon-like
pieces of lint which were used as packing."Another method is to stuff
the bowel with fragments of sponge to which threads are tied, the ends
of which, protruding from the anus, facilitate their withdrawal.In
conjunction with these procedures the patient's pelvis should be
elevated.{928} After excision of portions of the mucous membrane the
risk of hemorrhage will be lessened by the surgeon introducing through
the edges of each incision a few fine sutures.Enormous quantities of blood may escape into the bowel after operations
without any external symptom being apparent until the patient becomes
pallid and weak.In other cases the patient will complain of tenesmus
and desire to go to stool, or of a sensation of something trickling
into the bowel.Upon the recognition of these symptoms search should at
once be made for internal hemorrhage.Before taking leave of this very interesting class of diseases and of
their modes of treatment, it seems proper to introduce a few remarks
upon the subject of rectal alimentation, as it is now a well-recognized
and much-practised means of sustaining those whose stomachs are unequal
to the work which in health is so easily and unconsciously performed.In the use of the lower bowel as an absorbent surface of alimentary
substances many failures have been reported, a fair proportion of
which, it is safe to infer, are due to the methods employed, to the
nutritive matters employed, and to the condition of the rectum at the
time.Firstly, as to the state of the rectum, it must be empty.Wait a
reasonable time, say an hour, after stool, so that the gut may be more
passive; have the patient in the recumbent posture; direct him to
resist tenesmus and to exert both the will and the muscular power to
retain the aliment.The syringe must be of hard rubber, must be
rectal-ended, and of the capacity of two fluidounces, and perfect in
action.The preparation to be introduced, after being warmed to a temperature
of 98 degrees or 99 degrees F., should be very slowly injected with the
syringe, which should be also warmed and oiled.The enema must never
exceed in amount two fluidounces.If this be rejected, wait a
reasonable time and try again, using a less amount.If tenesmus proves
an insurmountable barrier to ordinary means, an opium suppository is to
be introduced three hours prior to another attempt.It has been
suggested, inasmuch as tenesmus is often relieved by the application of
cold to the rectum, to introduce the aliment in that state; but this
method is open to the objection that rectal digestion would be much
less likely to take place under this condition, as the bowel would then
have thrown upon it the additional work of warming up the substance
prior to absorbing it.The usual errors made in applying this means of sustaining the patient
are, that the injections are too large, are too rapidly introduced, and
are not of the proper temperature.Allowing an interval of eight hours
between the enemata would afford three in the twenty-four hours, which
method has been found to offer the best results.This must be
persevered in at regular daily intervals for the patient to derive its
full benefit, and there is reason to suppose that the nervous system
gets expectant of these daily hours of support, as it does in the case
of our ordinary meal-times.An examination of the well-formed daily
stools of patients thus sustained will prove how close the analogy is
between this and digestion proper.{929} Next, as to the substances to be employed.The best of these are
milk, eggs, concentrated beef-extracts or beef or chicken peptones, and
brandy or whiskey of good quality.These substances may be combined in
various proportions to suit the individual requirements of the case.A
very good mixture for this purpose is two tablespoonfuls of milk, one
tablespoonful of whiskey, and an egg, using both the yelk and the
albumen.This should be well beaten up and
properly warmed.It is well to persevere in the use of these enemata even though at
first most of them appear to be rejected, as after a time, the rectum
becoming accustomed to their presence, absorption or so-called rectal
digestion may take place.This form of alimentation should be kept in
reserve in a case of chronic illness until all other methods of
sustaining the patient prove insufficient to support life.It is not
contraindicated even in some cases of chronic diarrhoea with persistent
vomiting and loss of peptic function, advantage being taken of the
intervals between the evacuations to introduce a small and very
concentrated nutrient enema.In ordinary cases not complicated by
diarrhoea the most convenient times will be found to be about seven
o'clock in the morning, three in the afternoon, and eleven at night.Wetherill suggests the possibility of forming with solid extract of
beef, pepsin, and pure suet a nutrient suppository which might be
retained and absorbed in some cases in which it has been found
impossible to retain the enemata.A very small addition of white wax,
he thinks, would keep these solid during warm weather; if not, the suet
might be replaced by ol.theobroma (as in ordinary suppositories),
which is probably as likely to be absorbed as the suet.{930}

INTESTINAL WORMS.BY JOSEPH LEIDY, M.D.All animals, except in general the simple cell-forms constituting the
sub-kingdom of protozoa, under ordinary circumstances are more or less
liable to be infested with others, called parasites, which commonly
live at the expense of their hosts, frequently with little or no
inconvenience, but often causing discomfort and suffering even unto
death.Parasites are distinguished as external and internal, the two
being mostly of a widely different character.The former chiefly
pertain to the division of arthropoda, or animals with jointed limbs,
as exemplified by lice, fleas, and flies of the class of insects, mites
of the class of arachnides, and epizoans and isopods of the class of
crustaceans.Internal parasites, from their usual habitation named entozoa, are
commonly observed in the intestines of animals, and hence their
distinction as intestinal worms.The name has proved to be appropriate,
for investigations have shown that most entozoa, observed from time to
time in other parts of the bodies of animals, pass part of their life
in the intestinal canal of the same or of some other animal.By far the greater number of entozoa are peculiar animals, constituting
the chief part of the scolecides, an extensive group of the sub-kingdom
of vermes or worms.Of this group they comprise the orders of CESTODES,
or tape-worms; the ACANTHOCEPHALI, or thorn-headed worms; the
TREMATODES, or fluke-worms; and the greater portion of the NEMATODES,
or thread-worms.Many entozoa also belong to the protozoa, but these,
so far as relates to man in a medical point of view, appear
unimportant, and will therefore not here enter into consideration.In the course of their life entozoa undergo changes of form and
condition, and pass these in different organs of the same or of
different animals, and it may be for a brief period externally or in a
non-parasitic state.In many instances, as in the tape-worms and the
fluke-worms, the transformations accompanying the changes are of so
extraordinary a character that until their life-history was
investigated the successive metamorphoses were viewed as distinct
animals.Mostly, the entozoa pass one stage of existence within the
intestine of some animal, and another stage in different organs of
other animals.Many, perhaps most species, in each stage are peculiar
to one or a few nearly-related animals, but others of the same kind
infest a number of different animals.The animals infested by the same
parasite may be remotely as well as nearly related.Thus the Taenia
saginata, or beef tape-worm, in the mature state lives in the small
intestine of man {931} only, but in its juvenile or larval condition in
the flesh meat of the ox.The Taenia elliptica, the common tape-worm of
the intestine of the dog, in the larval condition lives in the louse of
this animal.The liver-fluke, Distomum hepaticum, occasionally found in
the liver of man, but of common occurrence in the sheep, to which it
proves so destructive in the affection known as rot, in the juvenile
condition lives in a little fresh-water snail of the genus Lymneus.The
guinea-worm, Filaria medinensis, which in the mature state is found
beneath the skin of man, in the larval condition inhabits the minute
crustacean cyclops of stagnant waters.As would be reasonably supposed, entozoa commonly gain access to their
hosts through the food and drink, though in the case of aquatic animals
they also obtain entrance directly through the integument from the
surrounding medium.So long as they remain in the intestinal canal they
may occasion little trouble or inconvenience.When they are numerous in
this position or proportionately large, according to their peculiar
nature they may produce more or less suffering and even the most
serious consequences.Generally, however, it is when they occupy other
positions, to which they have migrated from the intestine, that they
induce aggravated symptoms proportioned to their numbers and the nature
of the organs they infest.Many species of entozoa have been discovered in man, and most of them
are peculiar in kind.Many are common, and, while some are widely
extended, others are more or less restricted to certain localities.They are variable in their frequency, largely proportioned to the
prevalence of habits which are favorable to their transmission, and
which, though under control, are more or less disregarded.Some species
are so rare in their occurrence that they seem to be accidental, and
therefore of comparatively little interest to the physician.In general, the frequency of occurrence of intestinal worms is
proportioned to the extent of use of uncooked or insufficiently cooked
meats, the drinking of unfiltered standing waters, uncleanly habits,
and the intimacy of association with domestic animals.It therefore
follows that important prophylactics against infection by parasites are
properly-cooked food, the use of spring or freely-running water or
filtered standing water, cleanly habits, and the avoidance of intimacy
with domestic animals.The Cestodes, or Tape-worms.Tape-worms in the mature condition inhabit the intestines of vertebrate
animals, and are usually conspicuous for their long, tape-like
appearance and jointed character.In the juvenile or larval state they
infest the various organs, except the interior of the intestinal canal,
of both vertebrates and invertebrates, and in this condition are so
diminutive and inconspicuous that until a comparatively recent period
they for the most part remained unnoticed, and when known their
relationship with the mature forms was not recognized.The mature tape-worm, as ordinarily observed, is a long, soft, flat,
white worm, which from its resemblance has received its familiar name.{932} It has a small head, succeeded by a short, more slender neck
gradually widening into the body, which is divided transversely into
segments.These, which are usually called joints or links, and also
named proglottides, are so many individuals, and finally become
separated to hold an independent existence.The tape-worm clings to the
mucous membrane of the intestine by its head, which is provided for the
purpose with suckers, and in many cases also with circlets of hooks.The segments of the body are incessantly produced by gradual growth and
successive division of the neck, and as they enlarge they become more
distinct and develop within a bisexual generative apparatus for each.The worm has neither mouth nor intestine, but is nourished by
imbibition from the surrounding liquid in which it lies constantly
bathed.A pair of longitudinal vessels commences in the head and
extends throughout the body, one on each side, and in some genera is
joined by a transverse vessel at the fore and back part of every
segment.The mature segments have no body-cavity, but are occupied with
a complex bisexual generative apparatus, which is self-impregnating.Finally the uterus, usually much ramified, becomes especially
conspicuous through distension with eggs, and the rest of the organs
for the most part become atrophied.The ripe segments successively
detach themselves from those in advance, often singly and not
infrequently several linked together.In this condition, often in
lively movement, they are discharged with the feces, and thus commonly
render themselves obvious to their host.Subsequently they may continue
to live a brief period externally in a non-parasitic condition.Ordinarily, in moist excrement, or in water or similar materials, they
will remain alive for several days.After the discharge of the tape-worm segments, together with the eggs
which had been previously laid by the latter and those still contained
within them, any or all may be swallowed by animals feeding in places
where the infected excrement has been deposited.When the proglottides
and eggs are taken into the stomach they are digested and the embryos
or proscolices are liberated.The embryo or proscolex of the tape-worm is a microscopic spherical or
oval body, provided at one pole with three pairs of divergent spicules,
by which it is enabled to penetrate the walls of the stomach or
intestine of its host.From these positions the embryo migrates either
directly or through the blood-vessels to some other organ, most
frequently the liver or the muscles.Having reached its destination, it
becomes fixed in position, and for a time remains comparatively
quiescent, but undergoes further development.The embryo loses its
spicules and is transformed into the larval form or scolex.In most
species of tape-worms the scolex is simple or individual in character,
and consists of a head like that of the parent or mature worm, with a
neck ending in a capacious cyst, within which the head and neck are
inverted.In this form the scolex is contained in a sac of connective
tissue induced by the presence of the parasite.Such sacs, frequently
observed imbedded in the flesh, liver, lungs, and other organs of
animals, are familiarly known as measles.In this condition the
scolices of certain tape-worms have long been known, but as their
relationship was not recognized, they were viewed as distinct species
of parasites and described as cysticerci.In other species of
tape-worms the scolex is of compound character; that is to say, the
embryo {933} in its further development gives rise to the production of
one or more groups of individuals in conjunction.The compound scolex
thus forms a sac or a group of sacs, the basis of hydatid tumors.These
occur of various sizes, even up to that of a child's head, and may
occupy any organ of the body.They consist of a spherical sac or group
of sacs, simple in character or containing others, ranging in size from
that of a mustard-seed to that of a marble, or larger to that of a
walnut, enclosed in an envelope of connective tissue induced by the
presence of the parasite.The sacs are filled with liquid, and have,
attached within or free and floating, or less frequently attached
without, variable numbers of little white grains, which on examination
with the microscope exhibit the same constitution as the simple scolex
above described.As in the case of the cysticerci of measles, the
scolices of hydatids have long been known, but as their relationship
with the mature forms was unrecognized until lately, they were regarded
as distinct parasites and described as echinococci and coenuri.Sometimes the compound scolex fails in development further than the
production of the sacs, which then constitute the so-called
acephalocysts.Measles with their occupants, when retained in the muscles or other
organs, ordinarily undergo no further development, but ultimately,
after some months to a year or two, undergo degradation.The larva or
scolex dies and atrophies; the measle degenerates, and often becomes
the focus of calcareous deposit, shrinks to a little cicatrix, and may
finally disappear.Of a more serious nature is the tape-worm embryo
which produces the hydatid tumor.With the increase of this,
proportioned to the production of sacs and scolices, it may become so
large as greatly to interfere with the function of the organ it
occupies, and according to the nature of this organ will be the gravity
of the affection.When, however, the flesh or other parts of animals affected with
measles or hydatids containing active scolices are used as food in a
raw or insufficiently cooked state, the meats are digested in the
stomach and the scolices liberated to pursue their further development.Passing into the small intestine, the active scolex everts its head
from its caudal sac, which atrophies and disappears, and the parasite
attaches itself to the mucous membrane, and rapidly develops and grows
into the conspicuous and familiar form of the adult tape-worm.The
duration of life of the latter while maintaining its position in the
intestine is uncertain, but under favorable circumstances it commonly
continues for years, and thus, with the incessant production of ripe
segments charged with eggs, it becomes a constant focus of infection.*       *       *       *       *

Three species of tape-worm in the mature condition are common parasites
of man, living in the small intestine.They are the Taenia saginata,
Taenia solium, and Bothriocephalus latus.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA SAGINATA.--SYNONYMS: Taenia mediocanellata; Beef tape-worm;
Unarmed tape-worm; Fat tape-worm.Larval condition: Cysticercus saginata; Beef measle-worm.This, which is now regarded as the most common tape-worm of man, is
named the beef tape-worm because it is derived from the beef used as
food.In the mature condition it lives only in the small intestine of
{934} man, and in the juvenile condition it lives in the ox.Its
frequency is proportioned to the prevalence of the custom of eating
beef in a raw or insufficiently cooked state, conjoined with the
careless habit of leaving human excrement in pastures where it is
accessible to cattle.The mature beef tape-worm is commonly observed as a soft,
yellowish-white, thickish, band-like worm, ranging from six to twenty
feet or more in length.The head, about the size of a yellow
mustard-seed, is rounded quadrate and provided with four equidistant
hemispherical suckers.Succeeding the head is a short, slightly
narrower, flattened neck, which merges into the gradually widening and
segmented body.The segments, at first narrow fore and aft and several
times wider than the length, become successively larger,
proportionately longer, more distinct, and quadrate in outline; and
finally the length may exceed the breadth two or three times.A
full-grown tape-worm may possess twelve hundred segments and more, and
specimens are recorded as reaching a length of thirty feet.The larger
segments measure from a quarter of an inch to an inch long and from
three to four lines wide.The larger or riper segments exhibit on one
border, irregularly alternating on the two sides, at or near the
middle, a papilla in which is the external aperture of the genital
apparatus.In the fully-ripe segments the uterus, distended with eggs,
may be obscurely seen through the wall of the body, but is rendered
more visible by drying the segments, moderately compressed, between two
pieces of glass.It appears as a long, narrow, white or brownish median
line or tube, giving off laterally numerous short, transverse, more or
less branching tubes.The worm in its usual position lies along the course of the intestine
in loose coils, and exhibits lively movements, alternately shortening
and elongating, expanding and contracting the head, and protruding and
retracting the suckers.The ripe segments spontaneously detach
themselves, and may be found scattered along the large intestine ready
to be discharged with the excrement, or, as is sometimes the case, they
may spontaneously creep from the anus.Rarely more than a single worm
infests a person at the time.According
to Perroncito, quoted by Cobbold, a mature worm was reared from a beef
measle, swallowed by a student, in fifty-four days.It is estimated that the number of eggs in the mature segments of the
beef tape-worm amounts to about 35,000.As the full-grown worm may
consist of 1200 segments, and there is reason to believe these are
renewed several times annually, we learn that the whole number of eggs
produced by a single individual is enormous.The ripe segments,
attached to the parent or becoming spontaneously detached, lay their
eggs in the intestine to be discharged with the feces.When more or
less emptied they shrink and appear reduced in size, and in this
condition are expelled or spontaneously creep from the anus.If the
ripe segments are forcibly expelled and are alive, they will lay their
eggs in the feces externally.The ripe eggs are brown, oval, about 0.03
mm.long, and have a thick shell, with an outer vertically striated
envelope.As previously intimated, the common source of the beef tape-worm in man
is the use of raw or insufficiently cooked beef affected with measles.The ox becomes infested by swallowing the eggs, or, it may be, even the
entire segment, of a tape-worm deposited with feces in the {935}
pastures of cattle.The measles usually occur in the muscles, including
the heart, though they have also been noticed in the liver and lungs.They appear, in beef, as oval, whitish bodies from the size of a
mustard-seed to that of a pea.They consist of a sac of connective
tissue containing the larval tape-worm or cysticercus.Measles under
ordinary circumstances are seldom noticed in beef, and when they occur
are commonly few in number.According to the latest authorities--Leuckart, Cobbold, Stein, and
others--the beef tape-worm is the most common of the cestodes which
infest man.Until within about thirty years it was generally not
distinguished from the pork tape-worm, and this was accordingly
regarded as the most common human species.Since the writer distinctly
recognized the beef tape-worm within the last twenty years, all the
specimens of Taeniae, from people of Philadelphia and its vicinity,
that have been submitted to him for examination--perhaps in all about
fifty--have appeared to belong solely to Taenia saginata.The
prevalence of this species with us is no doubt due to the common custom
of eating underdone or too rare beef, while the pork tape-worm is
comparatively rare, as with us pork is only used in a well-cooked
condition.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA SOLIUM.--SYNONYMS: The Pork tape-worm; Solitary tape-worm; Armed
tape-worm.Larval condition: Cysticercus cellulosae; Pork measle-worm.Until a recent period this species was generally regarded as the most
common tape-worm of man--a view which in great measure was due to the
circumstance that the beef tape-worm was not distinguished from it.It
was called the solitary tape-worm, still expressed by the specific
name, from the impression that it rarely occurred otherwise than single
at a time in a person.This has also proved to be incorrect, likewise
due to the two kinds of tape-worms having been confounded together; for
while the beef tape-worm most commonly occurs solitary, the pork
tape-worm not unfrequently occurs with several together.The species is now appropriately named the pork tape-worm, as
indicating its common source--pork used as food.The frequency of the
parasite is proportioned to the prevalence of the custom of using pork
in a raw or imperfectly cooked state, conjoined with that of depositing
excrement where it may be accessible to hogs.In the mature condition
the pork tape-worm is peculiar to man and lives in the small intestine,
but in the larval condition, though especially infesting the hog, it
also occasionally infests man, and lives in any organs of the body, but
mostly the muscles, liver, and lungs.The mature pork tape-worm, as commonly seen, is a soft white, thin,
band-like worm, from five to ten feet long and about four lines where
widest.The head is spheroid, about the size of that of an ordinary
pin, and smaller than that of the beef tape-worm.It is furnished with
four hemispherical cup-like suckers, and the summit forms a blunt
papilla armed with a double circle of twenty-five or twenty-six hooks.The neck is narrow, thread-like, about an inch long, and merges into
the segmented body, which gradually widens to the extent mentioned.The
segments, at first much wider than long, as they successively enlarge
also become more distinct and proportionately longer, so that the more
{936} posterior ripe ones are as long as they are wide, and often
longer, though not to the same degree as in the beef tape-worm.The
genital papilla, with its external aperture, is marginal as in the
latter.The fully-developed uterus is quite distinctive in character
from that of the beef tape-worm.The median tube is coarser, and the
lateral branches are likewise coarser, much fewer--half the number or
fewer--less branched, and less crowded.The ripe and often
spontaneously detached segments are commonly longer than broad, more or
less elliptical in outline, with truncated ends, and usually measure
about half an inch in length by about a third in breadth.The ripe eggs
resemble those of the beef tape-worm, but are usually spheroid in
shape.The common source of the pork tape-worm is pork affected with measles
eaten in the raw or insufficiently cooked state.The hog becomes
affected with measles when it has access to human excrement containing
eggs and ripe segments of the tape-worm, which it eats with avidity.The eggs, with their already developed embryos, when swallowed, undergo
the same series of transformations and course as those indicated in the
account of the beef tape-worm.Pork affected with measles is much more
common than beef affected in the same way, and is frequently a subject
of ordinary observation.From the difference in habit of the hog and ox
this is what might have been suspected; and the fact that the beef
tape-worm is more common than the pork tape-worm is to be explained
from the circumstance that fresh beef is in more general use than pork,
and is usually employed less thoroughly cooked.The pork measles are commonly seen as round or oval, hard, whitish
bodies, from the size of a hempseed to that of a pea, imbedded in the
connective tissue of the muscles or flesh.The measle consists of a sac
of connective tissue enclosing the scolex or larval tape-worm, which
resembles that of the beef tape-worm, but differs especially in the
possession of a double circlet of hooks to the head, as in the adult
worm.The scolex has long been known, and was regarded as a distinct
parasite, with the name of Cysticercus cellulosae.When fresh pork
measles are swallowed by man they are digested in the stomach, and the
cysticercus or scolex is released and passes into the small intestine.Here, attaching itself to the mucous membrane by means of its suckers
and crown of hooks, it rapidly develops and grows into the adult
tape-worm.In this condition it lies in loose folds along the
intestine, to which it clings so tenaciously that commonly the neck
gives way when the greater part of the worm is forcibly detached by the
use of medicines.Fragments, consisting of the more mature segments,
frequently appear detached from the posterior part of the worm, and the
fully-ripe segments may be seen scattered singly in the course of the
large intestine.The isolated segments are thinner and more translucent
than those of the beef tape-worm, and in this condition are discharged
with the feces, but may also spontaneously creep from the anus, though
seldom as compared with the other species.Experiments repeatedly made by swallowing pork measles prove that the
mature tape-worm may be developed in the course of three months.The
length of life attained by it under favorable circumstances is
uncertain, but it probably continues a dozen years or more.The scolex of the pork tape-worm, or the cysticercus, so common in the
hog, is also less frequently a parasite of man, and in this condition
is a {937} more potent agent of danger than in its ordinary or mature
state.The infection is due to the introduction of eggs or mature
segments of the tape-worm into the stomach--a circumstance which may
readily occur through handling these objects and transferring them to
the mouth, or more rarely perhaps by their transference from the
intestine into the stomach through vomiting.In the measle form the parasite may occur in any organ of the body, but
is mostly found in the muscles and subcutaneous tissue.Its
pathological significance depends on its number and position.Located
in the nerve-centres, it may occasion the most serious consequences.Usually it occurs in small numbers and gives rise to no obvious
inconvenience, and is only accidentally detected in dissection after
death.It appears to maintain its vitality for some years, but finally
dies, and undergoes degradation.Only when it can be detected in such
position as the interior of the eye or beneath the conjunctiva can the
patient be relieved by surgical aid.Elsewhere, even if its presence is
suspected, it is ordinarily beyond the reach of medical treatment.The
writer a few years since, in dissecting the body of a <DW52> man to
illustrate his lectures on the muscles, found two living measles, of
which one was in the diaphragm and the other in the transversalis
muscle of the abdomen, but none were detected elsewhere.The parasite
unquestionably gave no inconvenience to its host during life.*       *       *       *       *

Other species of Taenia which have been observed as parasitic in the
human intestine are mostly of rare occurrence.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA CUCUMERINA, the common tape-worm of the dog, and TAENIA
ELLIPTICA, the common tape-worm of the cat, are very much alike in
appearance, and are regarded by many authorities as the same species.They occur frequently in considerable numbers in these animals, living
in the small intestine.They have also been occasionally found in man,
especially children.It is a comparatively delicate worm, chain-like in appearance, ranging
from four inches to a foot in length.The head is provided with four
suckers and a prominent rostellum armed with about sixty hooks.The
neck and anterior part of the body are thread-like.The mature segments
are elliptical in outline or like a melon-seed, whence the name.There
is a double set of sexual organs, and a genital orifice occupies the
middle of both lateral margins of the segments.The ripe segments
become readily detached and creep actively in the intestine, and are
either expelled with the feces or they spontaneously creep from the
anus.The eggs are comparatively few and measure 0.05 mm.Late researches appear to show that the eggs adhering to the hair about
the anus or elsewhere are eaten by lice of the same animals, and within
these insects undergo further development.The dog and cat,
subsequently swallowing the lice, infect themselves with the mature
worms.Thus also persons, especially children, from too great
familiarity with these animals, directly or through their food, may
likewise become infected.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA NANA, the Dwarf tape-worm, has been observed but once.It was
discovered by Bilharz, in Egypt, in a boy who died of meningitis.It
{938} is a little worm, about half an inch in length, and occurred in
large numbers in the duodenum.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA TENELLA.--This is another small species, which has been but once
observed.It is described by Cobbold, who suspects it to be derived
from measles of the sheep.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA FLAVOPUNCTATA is also a small species, from eight to ten inches
long, with ripe joints about one millimeter long and from one and a
half to two millimeters broad.It is described by Weinland, and has
also been but once observed.A half-dozen specimens were discharged
from a healthy child, of nineteen months, in Boston, Mass.Since the above was written the author has had the opportunity of
examining some little tape-worms which he suspects to be of the same
kind as the former.They occurred in the practice of T. V. Crandall in
Philadelphia, and were expelled from a child of three years of age
after the use of santonin.About a dozen fragments appear to have
pertained to three worms, from twelve to fifteen inches in length.The anterior part of the body is thread-like, the
posterior part about two and a quarter millimeters wide.The width of
the joints is more than twice the length.The ripe joints are pale
brown, and are remarkable for the comparative simplicity of the uterus,
which is distended with brown eggs.A peculiarity of the worm is the
repeated but irregular alternation of fertile with sterile joints.[1]

[Footnote 1: _Amer.of Medical Sciences_, 1884, p.The species is probably more common than might be supposed, and from
its small size, and perhaps harmless character, has generally escaped
notice.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA MADAGASCARIENSIS.--This species, described by Davaine, is
imperfectly known.Fragments of the worm have been twice observed in
the Comoro Islands.*       *       *       *       *

BOTHRIOCEPHALUS LATUS.--SYNONYMS: Dibothrium latum; Taenia lata; Broad
tape-worm.This tape-worm, of another genus than the preceding, is a common
parasite of man in certain localities of Europe, but has not been found
as an indigenous product elsewhere.It occurs especially in Sweden and
Russia, East Prussia, Poland, and West Switzerland.In the latter
country it prevails to such an extent that it is reported that about
one-fourth of the inhabitants of Geneva are thus infested.Among the
tape-worms submitted to the writer from time to time for identification
a few years ago was a large specimen of Bothriocephalus latus, but it
proved to have been derived from a Swede who had arrived in this
country only a few months previously.There are many species of Bothriocephalus, which in the adult condition
mainly live in fishes.The genus is distinguished from Taenia by many
points, chiefly in the form and construction of the head, the form of
the joints and uterus, and the position of the genital aperture, which
is situated centrally on one of the broad surfaces instead of the
lateral margin.{939} The broad tape-worm is the largest of the tape-worms infesting
man, a full-grown specimen reaching to twenty-five feet in length with
a breadth of three-fourths of an inch, and consisting of upward of four
thousand segments.It is a soft, grayish, flat, band-like worm, with
head, neck, and segmented body holding the same proportions as in the
other tape-worms.The head is elongated, clavate, and is provided with
a long, narrow, elliptical sucker on each side.The narrower neck is
short and merges into the segmented body, which gradually widens to
half an inch or more.As the segments successively enlarge, they
increase proportionately to a greater extent in breadth, so that their
width for the most part measures from two to four times their length.A
few toward the end of the series become narrower and longer than those
in advance.In the ripe segments the uterus, distended with brownish
eggs, forms a central rosette-like group of pouches.The genital
aperture is central in the broad surface of the segments, and is always
on the same or ventral side.The broad tape-worm inhabits the small intestine, and is usually found
single, but occasionally several together, and sometimes also in
association with one or both the other common tape-worms.The species
is also reported to be not infrequent in the dog.Ripe portions of the broad tape-worm become detached in fragments of
variable length, to be discharged with the feces.The partially-emptied
appearance of the uteri in these fragments indicates the laying of the
eggs previous to the expulsion of the latter.The eggs are oval, of a
light-brown color, and measure about 0.07 mm.The shell at one
pole is furnished with an operculum or lid for the escape of the
embryo.This is developed subsequently to the discharge of the eggs
from the intestine.If the eggs are placed in water, in the course of
some months the embryos are developed and escape from the shell.The
embryo is a round or oval body furnished with three pairs of spicules,
as in that of the Taeniae, but differs in possessing a ciliated
envelope, by means of which it freely swims about in the water.After
some days the embryo discards its envelope and creeps about in an
amoeboid manner.Further than this, until recently, the fate of the
embryo was unknown.Petersburg, after determining the
presence of scolices of Bothriocephalus in the muscles, liver, and
organs of generation of the pike, trout, and eel-pout, by feeding these
to cats and dogs succeeded in rearing worms which differed in no
respect, except in being smaller, from the Bothriocephalus latus of
man.Such being the case, it becomes evident that man may ordinarily
become infested with the parasite by eating raw or insufficiently
cooked fishes of the kind mentioned.*       *       *       *       *

BOTHRIOCEPHALUS CORDATUS, described by Leuckart as a common species
infesting the dog in Greenland, has been reported as having once been
found in a woman.Bottger regards it as not distinct from
Bothriocephalus latus.*       *       *       *       *

BOTHRIOCEPHALUS CRISTATUS.--This species, but once observed, is
described by Davaine.It was passed by a child in Paris, and the worm
was upward of nine feet in length.*       *       *       *       *

SYMPTOMS OF TAPE-WORMS.--Whichever may be the species of {940}
tape-worm infesting the human intestine, the symptoms to
